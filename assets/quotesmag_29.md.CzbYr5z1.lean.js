It rises above the village of Losenstein on a rock (Castle Rock), composed of dolomite. It is one of the largest and oldest ruins of Upper Austria. Built in the 12th century by the Styrian Ottokars, the Castle of Losenstien consists of the main building and one major ancillary tower. Beginning in 1252 the Lords of Losenstein (Losenstein) owned the castle. The castle offers views of the village of Losenstein, the river Enns, and the foothills in the direction of Styria. The castle of Losenstein is freely accessible. The original structure of the castle is still visible. Exterior walls, gothic windows and large arches are still visible. The individual premises such as church, living area, patio and economic activity are defined precisely.  History The Styrian Otakare built this castle around 1150 to protect themselves from invading troops in the Steiermark. 1170 the castle was first mentioned in 1252 and went to Dietmar of Steyr, which received it from King Ottokar II Przemysl in exchange for the city of Steyr. From that point on, the family of Dietmar and his descendants are known as the Lords of Losenstein. Until their extinction in 1692, they continuously owned the castle. The grave of the family of Losenstein are located in Garsten (Losenstein chapel). Then the line went through inheritance over to the generation of von Auersperg, who eventually sold the castle in 1905 to the province of Upper Austria.  Current use  The ruins of Losenstein Castle have served on several occasions as a venue for plays. The castle theatre group of Losenstein has made use of the location on multiple occasions. It is a common place for historic tours by school groups and history buffs, and home more recently to the castle rock climbing area. The preservation of the historic building and the maintenance of the possibility for a variety of activities in this unique cultural treasure has been given highest priority. Signage allows interested visitors to understand the historical and cultural significance of the ruins of Castle Losenstein.

He then commanded HMS Beagle on its first voyage of exploration in the south Atlantic. After two years in command of the Beagle, depressed by the harsh winter conditions of the Strait of Magellan, he committed suicide. Early career Pringle Stokes was born on 23 April 1793, son of Charles and Elizabeth Stokes. He was baptized at Chertsey on 2 May 1793. At the age of twelve, on 5 June 1805 he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in HMS Ariadne. Stokes served as a lieutenant on board the frigate HMS Owen Glendower, which left England for South America in November 1819. Robert FitzRoy, who was to take command of the Beagle after Stokes died, also served on the Owen Glendower on this voyage. He had joined the ship as a college volunteer in 1819, aged fourteen. The young FitzRoy and Stokes, who was in his late twenties, would have become acquainted on the two-year voyage. The Owen Glendower visited Saint Helena in October 1820 to report on the conditions in which the former Emperor Napoleon was being held. Spencer commanded the ship on its journey round Cape Horn to Valpara√≠so in Chile, arriving in January 1821. The ship remained in Pacific waters off Chile and Peru until October 1821, when it sailed from Valparaiso, rounded the Horn again in rough weather, and returned to England via Rio de Janeiro, arriving in January 1822. In November 1822 Captain Sir Robert Mends took command of the Owen Glendower as senior officer on the west coast of Africa, charged with suppressing the West African slave trade. In one incident Stokes was wounded in a clash between the boat crews of the Owen Glendower and the local people of Fernando Po. On 3 July 1823 he led a party of boats up the New Calabar River, where they found an abandoned schooner that had been loaded with slaves but now only held seven in irons. The schooner was wrecked when the pilot ran it aground two days later. The Chief of New Calabar River sent the schooner's cargo of 184 slaves out to the Owen Glendower, which took them as far as Cape Coast before landing them. Sir Robert Mends died at Cape Coast on 4 September 1823. Stokes temporarily took command of the ship. Hearing of the death of Sir Robert Mends, Commander John Filmore, who had recently arrived on the African Station, appointed himself to command the station and transferred to the Owen Glendower. Stokes returned to England. In 1824 Stokes was involved in a dispute over the Spanish slaving schooner Fabiana, which had been captured by the ship's boats under Lieutenant Gray on the Bonny River ten days after Sir Robert Mends died. The opposing view, which apparently prevailed, was that the ship's boats had been dispatched under the orders of Sir Robert Mends, whose estate would be entitled to the prize money. In May 1824 Stokes was promoted to commander. Beagle voyage HMS Beagle in the Strait of Magellan, with Monte Sarmiento in the background The Beagle was built in 1819 in Woolwich. She was a relatively small ship of 235 tons, barque-rigged. Pringle Stokes commissioned her around the end of 1825. It was said of Stokes when he was appointed to command the Beagle \\"though he was not practised in professional science, he had been studying in Edinburgh to attain mathematics, and he was moreover an indomitable seaman.\\" On 22 May 1826 the Beagle left Plymouth along with the larger HMS Adventure under the overall command of Captain Phillip Parker King on a voyage of exploration of the southern coast of South America. The two ships were to chart the coasts between Montevideo and Chilo√© Island, with particular attention to the complex of channels and islands around Tierra del Fuego. The two ships left Montevideo on 19 November 1826, and surveyed the coasts of southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego around the Strait of Magellan until April 1827, returning to Rio Janeiro in June 1827. Stokes entered the Santa Cruz River and recorded the Isla Pav√≥n, about from the river's mouth. Pringle Stokes was objective in the way in which he described the Fuegians whom he first met in 1827, unusually for a European of his time. He blamed their primitive condition on the rigors of the climate. In December that year the two ships sailed south again, this time accompanied by a schooner named Adelaide, and in January 1828 made their base at Port Famine (Puerto del Hambre). From there, Stokes was directed to \\"proceed to survey the western coasts, between the Strait of Magalhaens and latitude 47¬∞ south, or as much of those dangerous and exposed shores as he could examine\\". He was to return to Port Famine by the end of July. Conditions were extremely difficult. The narrow rocky channels were uncharted. There were racing tides, storms and blizzards, and overcast skies or fog that made astronomical observations impossible. Describing a difficult time in January 1828, a member of the expedition said: Suicide Grave of Stokes in Punta Santa Ana After two years of stressful and dangerous work, Stokes became increasingly depressed. In June 1828 he wrote in his journal: When the ship returned to Port Famine on 27 July 1828, Stokes had not left his cabin for four weeks. Lieutenant William Skyring, the assistant surveyor, had in effect taken command. On 1 August 1828 Stokes shot himself. The bullet remained within his skull, but Stokes remained conscious and coherent. Gangrene set in, and Stokes finally died on 12 August 1828. William Skyring commanded the Beagle on its voyage to Montevideo for repairs. When it arrived there Robert FitzRoy, flag lieutenant of HMS Ganges, was given command. FitzRoy commanded the Beagle on its celebrated second voyage from 1831 to 1836, with the young naturalist Charles Darwin on board. The observations Darwin made contributed to his subsequent development of his theory of natural selection. Many years later, FitzRoy also suffered from depression, and committed suicide in 1865. Pringle Stokes was buried at the \\"English Cemetery\\", two miles from Port Famine. His gravestone is now displayed in the Museo Saleciano in Punta Arenas, about distant. Captain Phillip Parker King used Stokes' journal in preparing his official report of the voyage, but glossed over the suicide. In 2009 the State Library of New South Wales bought the remainder of Stokes' handwritten journal (parts had been eaten by rats) for AU$200,000.

The internal energy of a thermally isolated system may therefore change due to the exchange of work energy. The entropy of a thermally isolated system will increase in time if it is not at equilibrium, but as long as it is at equilibrium, its entropy will be at a maximum and constant value and will not change, no matter how much work energy the system exchanges with its environment. To maintain this constant entropy, any exchange of work energy with the environment must therefore be quasistatic in nature, in order to assure that the system remains essentially at equilibrium during the process. The opposite of a thermally isolated system is a thermally open system, which allows the transfer of heat energy and entropy. Thermally open systems may vary, however, in the rate at which they equilibrate, depending on the nature of the boundary of the open system. At equilibrium, the temperatures on both sides of a thermally open boundary are equal. At equilibrium, only a thermally isolating boundary can support a temperature difference.

After Later Tang conquered Later Liang, Dai continued to serve Later Tang until his death.  Background  Dai Siyuan's biography in the History of the Five Dynasties gave no family background or birthdate for him. However, it described him as a long-time officer under Zhu Quanzhong, who would eventually found the Later Liang. It was said that during the time that he served under Zhu, he was known for his military capabilities.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 64.  During Later Liang   During Emperor Taizu's reign  After Zhu Quanzhong seized the Tang throne in 907, establishing Later Liang (as its Emperor Taizu),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Dai Siyuan, who was serving as an imperial guard general, was made the prefect of Jin Prefecture (ÊôâÂ∑û, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). In 908, he was again made an imperial guard general, and then was made the defender (Èò≤Á¶¶‰Ωø, Fangyushi) of Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). In 909, he returned to the imperial guards as a general there.  During Zhu Yougui's and Zhu Zhen's reigns  In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who took the throne.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Zhu Yougui made Dai Siyuan the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei). During the subsequent reign of Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen (who overthrew Zhu Yougui and took over the throne), Dai was made the acting military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei). In 913, he was made full military governor of Baoyi.Dai's biography in the History of the Five Dynasties actually placed the time of his becoming acting military governor of Baoyi as being during Zhu Zhen's Zhenming era (915-921), but that contradicted the more certain date of his becoming military governor in the Zizhi Tongjian. Prior to Emperor Taizu's death, the Yan general Zhang Wanjin (ÂºµËê¨ÈÄ≤) had killed military governor of Yan's Yichang Circuit (Áæ©Êòå, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), Liu Jiwei (ÂäâÁπºÂ®Å) (the son of Yan's emperor Liu Shouguang), and then surrendered the circuit to Later Liang. Emperor Taizu then renamed the circuit Shunhua (È†ÜÂåñ) and made Zhang its military governor, but in 913 Zhang, fearing that he was not being trusted by Later Liang, offered to give up the post and become a military governor south of the Yellow River (i.e., in the heartland of Later Liang territory). Zhu Zhen initially replaced Zhang with Liu Shouguang's brother Liu Shouqi (ÂäâÂÆàÂ•á), who was then a Later Liang general, but at a later point apparently replaced Liu Shouqi with Dai. In 916, after Li Cunxu, the prince of Later Liang's archrival Jin, wrested control of the powerful Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan), to Shunhua's south, from Later Liang, he sent an army north to attack Shunhua. Fearing that he was being trapped, Dai abandoned Shunhua and fled back to the Later Liang capital Daliang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. At a later point, Dai was made the military governor of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). In 919, after then-supreme commander of Later Liang forces on the northern border with Jin, Wang Zan (ÁéãÁìö), was suffering defeats at the hand of Li Cunxu and Li Cunxu's generals, Zhu recalled Wang and replaced him with Dai. In 921, when Li Cunxu was dealing with the aftermaths of the assassination of his ally Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao at the hands of Wang Rong's adoptive son Zhang Wenli and opting to attack Zhang, Dai tried to take advantage by attacking the Jin frontline from the south, but was defeated by LI Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Cunshen. However, in 922, he was successful in defeating and capturing another adoptive brother of Li Cunxu's, Li Cunru (ÊùéÂ≠òÂÑí) the prefect of Wei Prefecture (Ë°õÂ∑û, in modern Puyang, Henan), as well as the cities in the region. It was said that it dealt the Jin army a heavy loss (as they lost one third of the military storage of their army) and reversed a trend of falling morale for the Later Liang army.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. However, during his campaigns, Dai left the defense of Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û) in the hands of his officers Lu Shunmi (ÁõßÈ†ÜÂØÜ), Liu Suiyan (ÂäâÈÅÇÂö¥), and Yan Yong (ÁáïÈ°í). In summer 923 ‚Äî shortly after Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as its Emperor Zhuangzong), Lu defected to Later Tang and revealed to the Later Tang emperor that Yun was being defended by less than 1,000 soldiers and that neither Liu nor Yan was supported well by the soldiers. The Later Tang emperor commissioned his adoptive brother Li Siyuan to launch a surprise attack on Yun, capturing it. In light of Yun falling to the Later Tang forces, which Zhu Zhen believed Dai was responsible for, he stripped the supreme commander role from Dai and demoted him to be the acting military governor of Xuanhua Circuit (ÂÆ£Âåñ, headquartered in modern Nanyang, Henan). (Dai was therefore sidelined during the campaign over the next few months, in which Later Liang was destroyed by Later Tang.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272.  During Later Tang  Later in the year, after Later Tang's Emperor Zhuangzong captured Daliang and Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang, Dai Siyuan went from Xuanhua's capital Deng Prefecture (ÈÑßÂ∑û) to Daliang to show submission to the new emperor. Emperor Zhuangzong returned him to Xuanhua. After Emperor Zhuangzong himself was killed in a mutiny in 926 and succeeded by Li Siyuan (as Emperor Mingzong),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.

Emperor Mingzong summoned him back to then-capital Luoyang to serve in the imperial guards, and later had him retire because of old age.

Life Horse artillery in 1808. Watercolour by Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht (1900). The artist's father, John Cornelis Hoynck van Papendrecht, was an accomplished student of drawing and painting, a skill that manifested itself in him from an early age. He completed his studies at the Amsterdam Handelsschool at commerce. At the urging of Charles Rochussen, a friend of his father's and a doyen of Dutch art, joined the winter programme at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. After two years in Antwerp, van Papendrecht lived in Munich for four years to continue his training. In 1884, van Papendrecht returned to Amsterdam. In 1889, he married a clergyman's daughter, Johanna Philippa van Gorkom. In 1892, the couple moved to Amstelveen and then to Rheden near Arnhem where they remained till 1902. The artist's final residence was in The Hague where he continued to live till his death in 1933. Career Franse Zouaaf. Watercolour by Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht. The total oeuvre of van Papendrecht is impressive in quantity. In 1885, van Papendrecht's drawings appeared in the popular illustrated magazine Eigen Haard. Five years later, he joined the editorial board of the Elsevier illustrated magazine. His fame as an illustrator was definitively established in 1893 following his contributions to a series of books that recorded the history of the Dutch Horse Artillery Corps (The Yellow Riders). Besides being a gifted illustrator, van Papendrecht was also a master of watercolour. Several hundred watercolours are extant in his name. Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht's oil paintings were famous, especially after his participation in the 1884 Exhibition of Living Masters in Amsterdam, and garnered prestigious prizes. Some of his awards include: * Willink van Collenprijs (1885) * Bronze medal at the St Louis World Fair (1904) * Silver medal for Art and Science of the House of Orange (1906) * Silver medal at the fifth National Art Exhibition (1907) * Honourable mention at the Salon de Paris (1907) * Gold medal at Munich (1909). Hoynck van Papendrecht was created a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau on his seventieth birthday. He was a fellow of the Arti et Amicitiae society, as well as the Pulchri Studio. Military Art Hoynck van Papendrecht's major fame stemmed from his vibrant paintings of military life. Until well into the 19th century, ideas of patriotism and military heroism played a major role in Dutch military art, and van Papendrecht was attracted to army scenes from early in his career. Leading painters of this innovative direction in the patriotic painting were the young painters George Hendrik Breitner and Isaac Isra√´ls, but especially Hoynck van Papendrecht. In 1875, he created romanticised heroic paintings based on the Battle of Waterloo (1815) and the Belgian Revolution (1830-1839). Along with his teacher Charles Rochussen, he collaborated with the officers Willem Constantijn Staring and Nicolaas van Es to create realistic illustrations for newsmagazines such as Elsevier and Eigen Haard, thereby vastly increasing the audience for military art. Landscapes and Portraiture Joannes Benedictus van Heutsz with his staff during the attack on Bate√´-ili√´k in 1901, by Jan Hoynck van Papendrecht Alongside his interest in military art, Hoynck van Papendrecht was deeply involved in landscape painting as well as portraiture. Owing to his careful study of his subjects and an acute eye for detail, his works are often treated as historical sources of information. He was recruited by the British art weekly The Graphic to make sketches of delegates to the Hague Conventions, in addition to the portraits of soldiers that he already published in it. In 1900, the famous book The Uniforms of the Dutch Navy and Army appeared in two parts, in which many of the illustrations were contributed by van Papendrecht.

He is also a five- time Indian and a three-time Canadian champion. Singh started his sporting career as a sixteen-year-old high school student in the small village of Punjab. In 2002, he came to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on a working visa, and also, in hopes for a more promising future and better life. While staying in Canada, Singh was unable to travel to international weightlifting competitions, and barred from participating in prestigious national events. He was discovered by former Olympian and coach Guy Greavette, who perceived him as a powerful athlete and quickly helped him build a sport. Singh made his international debut as part of the Canadian team at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in Vancouver, and eventually attained numerous successes by winning back-to-back national titles. In 2007, he gained his landed immigrant status, and held a dual citizenship with Canada, making him eligible to compete for the Olympics. Singh became the first weightlifter from British Columbia to represent Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics, since his head coach Greavette did so in 1988. In the men's featherweight class, he successfully lifted 115 kg for the single-motion snatch, and hoisted 151 kg more for the two-part, shoulder-to-overhead clean and jerk, to combine a total of 266 kg, finishing in twelfth place.

Her keel was laid on 26 November 1943, she was launched on 18 August 1944, and commissioned 1 November 1944. Built as a 100-foot bay and sound tender at a cost of $194,238, she required a year to build at a time when most ships were built in 40 days, making her the most expensive ship of her class. After commissioning, Smilax was assigned to the Seventh District and was stationed at Fort Pierce, Florida where she engaged in the aids to navigation mission. From 1 June 1954 to 9 November 1965, she was homeported out of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. While stationed in Florida she assisted on several search and rescue cases. After twenty years of service, Smilax was refitted with new engines, and given a barge. On 9 November 1965, she moved to Brunswick, Georgia as her new homeport, carrying out the aids to navigation mission for that area. She was redesignated WLI-315 in 1966, and WLIC-315 on 1 October 1979. In July 1999, Smilax moved to her current homeport of Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, relieving her sister ship of her aids to navigation duties. Mission Smilaxs mission, since her commissioning, has been to service aids to navigation, ensuring the safe navigation of mariners. From her current homeport she is responsible for maintaining 1,226 fixed aids to navigation such as lights and range markers.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 2012. Plot Homer becomes upset when someone believes him to be Bart's grandfather, and worries that he is no longer cool. He then meets Terrance, a cool donut chef from Portland, who is looking for a new place for him and his family to live as he believes Portland has been \\"played out\\". When he tells Homer that he sees potential in Springfield, Homer suggests he buy the house next door to his, which he does. The Simpsons meet Terrance's wife Emily, his pet armadillo Chuey, their daughter Corduroy and their son T-Rex, and get their first exposure to their way of life. While Homer and Lisa are immediately taken with the family, Bart is irritated by T-Rex's negative attitude and Marge is uncomfortable in their presence, particularly of Emily's public breastfeeding. Despite this Marge supports Homer in his desire to fit in with their lifestyle, and allows him to combine their yard with the neighbor's into a \\"mono-yard\\" and lets him, Bart and Lisa accompany Terrance and T-Rex to rock shows, Mexican wrestling, roller derby, Korean gangster films and Modern Art exhibitions, even though she grows concerned that the kids are becoming pretentious. The Simpsons are invited to T-Rex's birthday party, where Marge makes enemies of Emily and her fellow nursing mother friends by refusing to breast-feed Maggie. Meanwhile T-Rex mocks Homer's present and calls him a poseur, which angers Bart and he starts a fight with him. This causes friction between the families (Homer is uninvited to go midnight bike-riding), but when Bart explains himself Homer decides to sever all ties with Terrance and his family. Homer and Marge pressure Terrance and Emily to leave Springfield, but their \\"humble-bragging\\" of the town results in more cool people moving to Springfield. Their lifestyle quickly consumes the town; the Tire Fire becomes a Farmer's Market, the Android's Dungeon becomes a Taschen, King Toot's Music Store becomes King Toke's Medicinal Marijuana Centre, Springfield Elementary becomes a co-op, and the Kwik-E-Mart turns into Apu's House of Spats. Meanwhile, Bart makes up with T-Rex and invites him to watch TV with him. Excited by the prospect, he abandons his compost-turning duties and joins Bart. The unturned compost, however, catches fire and starts to spread. Homer and Terrance work together to put out the fire using large drums of baby formula Marge keeps in the garage. Terrence and Emily apologize to Homer and Marge for being so judgmental of their way of life. Shortly after, the New York Times names Springfield 'America's Coolest City', which means it is played out. Immediately upon hearing this, Terrance and Emily and the rest of the cool people move, much to Lisa's dismay. Production This is the fourth episode as show runner for longtime Simpsons writer Matt Selman. Selman had long had plans to eventually have the Simpsons visit Portland, an idea he first conceived after former Simpsons writer Bill Oakley moved to Oregon, but \\"that had to change once Portlandia made its successful debut.\\" Oakley is now writing for Portlandia.

Jayalalithaa Memorial MGR Memorial is a memorial structure built on the Marina beach in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. Spread over 8.25 acres, the memorial is located adjacent to the Anna Memorial. It was built in memory of Former Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran and his prot√©g√© J. Jayalalithaa, whose bodies were buried at the site on December 5, 2016. History The memorial was built in 1988 and inaugurated by Janaki Ramachandran, wife of M. G. Ramachandran, in May 1990. The memorial was remodelled and the complex was laid with marble and opened in 1992 by J. Jayalalithaa who had become the chief minister of the state of Tamil Nadu in the previous year. When J. Jayalalithaa died on 5 December 2016, she was buried next to MGR. This structure was designed by Architect Mr. K. Ramachandran, retired chief architect of PWD. Between 1996 and 1998, the mausoleum was again renovated at a cost of about 27.5 million. When the Indian Ocean tsunami struck the seafront in December 2004, the memorial was damaged. Repair works cost approximately 13.3 million. Dr MGR Memorial in Kamarajar Promenade MGR's tomb and memorial at Marina beach before renovation In 2012, the memorial was again renovated at a cost of 43 million, including 34 million for remodelling the facade and the surrounding walll. This renovation included a new entrance with the AIADMK party's two-leaves symbol and Pegasus, the horse from Greek mythology, landscaping of the open area around the memorial using Korean grass, and the planting of exotic, decorative plants such as palmyra alpha, date palm, spider lily and adenium. Also included were a granite pathway shaped like a guitar, stainless steel handles around the memorial, a fountain in the middle, waterfall at the rear, decorative lamps, and an overhead tower with lights both at the entrance and on the arch. Two pergolas 18 metres wide were also constructed, in addition to ramps for the physically challenged. The erection of the two-leaves insignia was opposed by the opposition DMK party. A public interest petition was filed in the Madras High Court in October 2012 against the erection of the two-leaves insignia, but was dismissed by the court. Entrance Bronze Pegasus at the entrance Full view of the entrance Until 2012, the facade of the memorial was a tall entry arch with folded hands which was replaced with a concrete replica of two-leaves emblem, the symbol of the AIADMK party founded by M. G. Ramachandran. The facade was also given a Grecian touch with the erection of a 12-foot-high bronze sculpture of Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology. The 3.75-tonne sculpture, by architect R. Ravindran, a sthapathi from Mamallapuram, is set on a 4.5-metre-high pedestal. Two 15.9-metre-high columns serving as the entrance were built with reinforced concrete. The elevated \\"two-leaves\\" structure is supported by a 6-metre-high beam serving as the stem. The leaf structure, with a span of 10.2 metres for each leaf, is a metre higher than the towering columns. The leaves have a slight resemblance to a honey comb and are visible from both the front and the rear. Museum A museum on M. G. R. is located within the memorial at the northern side of the campus.

Intangible asset valuation When the purchaser of an intangible asset is allowed to amortize the price of the asset as an expense for tax purposes, the value of the asset is enhanced by this tax amortization benefit.See paragraph 5.25 of International Valuation Standards Committee. Determination of Fair Value of Intangible Assets for IFRS Reporting Purposes. 2007. Specifically, the fair market value of the asset is increased by the present value of the future tax savings derived from the tax amortization of the asset. The present value of these savings is to be estimated and included as a part of the fair market value when valuing an intangible asset. Circularity of the tax amortization benefit The present value of the future tax savings is a mathematical function of the fair market value. This creates circularity, because the fair market value includes the present value of the tax savings.Deloitte. Fair Value, Intangible and Purchase Price Allocation. 2011 This circularity can be handled using a two-step procedure consisting in estimating the value of the intangible asset in the absence of the tax amortization benefit first and then grossing up the previous value by a tax amortization benefit factor.See section \\"Calculating the TAB\\" section about two-step procedure to solve the circularity issue :FMV\\\\,=\\\\,{VBAB * TAB_{factor}} where # FMV is the fair market value of the intangible asset # VBAB is the value of the intangible asset before amortization benefits # TAB factor is the result of the formula defined below Tax amortization benefit factor The tax amortization benefit factor (or TAB factor) is the result of a mathematical function of a corporate tax rate, a discount rate and a tax amortization period: :TAB_{factor}\\\\,=\\\\,{1 \\\\over [1-{t \\\\over n}*({1 \\\\over k}-{1 \\\\over (k*(1+k)^n)})]} where # TAB factor is the value assuming end-year discounting # t is the corporate tax rate applicable to the future amortization of the asset # n is the tax amortization period of the asset in years # k is the discount rate The corporate tax rate as well as the tax amortization period are defined by country-specific tax legislations. The tax amortization period might be different from the useful life used in accounting. For example, while trademarks can have an indefinite useful life for accounting purposes, the tax legislation of the United States establishes a mandatory 15-year amortization period for trademarks.IRC SECTION 704(c) AND IRC SECTION 197 INTANGIBLES See also * Business valuation * Business valuation standard * Intellectual property valuation * Market-based valuation * Purchase price allocation References Sources * The Canadian Institute of Chartered Business Valuators.

After one season at Division II Shaw University, Bright entered the 2010 NFL Draft but was not selected. He had brief stints with various Arena Football League teams, now playing for the Wichita Wild. Early life A native of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in the Delaware Valley, Bright graduated from Welsh Valley Middle School, and then attended Glen Mills School in Thornbury for two years, a school for court- adjudicated youths. Bright said he was sent there because of ‚Äúbehavioral problems.‚Äù As a junior, he transferred to Harriton High School in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, where he was an All-American defensive lineman, while also playing lacrosse and wrestling in the unlimited division at several freestyle tournaments. After recording 86 tackles and 14 sacks in his junior season, Bright was named to USA Todays ‚Äú2004 preseason Super 25 players‚Äù. Constantly drawing double- and triple-teams by opponents, Bright's dominance was noted by scouts. Tom Lemming of ESPN called him ‚Äúthe most dominating high school defensive lineman that I've seen in five years,‚Äù referring to Shaun Cody. At the Elite College Combine in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Bright dominated in one-on-one drills, ‚Äútossing‚Äù five-star offensive lineman (and future first round NFL draft pick) Eugene Monroe ‚Äúaside like a rag doll.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe was so powerful. He always had great leverage and got under taller players, and he had one of the best bull rushes I've ever seen,‚Äù said Rivals.com analyst Mike Farrell. Although initially invited to the U.S. Army All-American Bowl, he could not participate due to a suspension that also caused him to miss his final high school game. Regarded as a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Bright was listed as the No. 2 defensive tackle prospect of a class that also included Jerrell Powe, Ndamukong Suh, and Dan Williams.http://rivals.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/rankings/rank-879 Only DeMarcus Granger of Kimball High School in Dallas was ranked in front of him. Recruited by dozens of schools, Bright narrowed his choices down to Miami, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Florida State, Texas A&M;, Purdue‚Äîwhere his older brother Eugene played defensive end‚Äîand Southern California. He only took two official visits, to Florida State and Texas A&M;, in December 2004.http://recruiting.scout.com/a.z?s=73&p;=8&c;=1&nid;=1205262 During National Signing Day, Bright committed to Florida State on ESPN News. Alongside wide receiver prospect Fred Rouse, Bright was considered to be the cornerstone of the Seminoles' 2005 recruiting class. College career Apart from his official visit, Bright never stepped onto FSU campus in Tallahassee, Florida. Because of his 2.5 core grade point average, he needed to get at least an 820 on the SAT to meet the NCAA's minimum eligibility standards, which he did not. Ineligible for college football, Bright briefly attended Hargrave Military Academy, a prep school in Chatham, Virginia, along with fellow Seminoles recruits Matt Hardrick and Justin Mincey. Bright was ranked as the No. 1 prep school prospect by Scout.com. While the Seminoles had a ‚Äúpainfully thin defensive front,‚Äù and were in dire need of a nose guard after the graduation of Brodrick Bunkley, his ‚Äúonetime heir apparent‚Äù Bright did not manage to qualify academically. Opting for the junior college route, he enrolled at Butler Community College in El Dorado, Kansas, to play football. He went through practice in 2007, but left the school before the season began. The birth of his son altered his career, causing him to take a job as a garbage man in Radnor, Pennsylvania, so he could also take night classes at Delaware County Community College. In July 2007, Bright was arrested in the delivery of marijuana to a Montgomery County police informant. Charged with a felony count of possession with the intent to deliver, Bright pleaded guilty and was sentenced to time served and two years' probation. Bright eventually wound up at Shaw University located in Raleigh, North Carolina. He spent two years on the scout team before regaining his academic eligibility in 2009. In his only season of college football, he registered 48 tackles, 7.5 tackles for a loss and half a sack, which earning him selection to the CIAA All-Rookie team. He then decided to bypass his senior year and to enter the 2010 NFL Draft. Professional career 2010 NFL Draft After preparing for the draft at All-Star Sports Training in Paisley, Florida, Bright was invited to participate at NC State‚Äôs pro-day, where he demonstrated his raw strength with 41 reps at the bench press, which was only topped among 2010 draft prospects by Mitch Petrus (45). According to Mike Mayock, there was ‚Äúsome interest in him as a late-draftable/preferred free-agent type.‚Äù While seen as a ‚Äúprototypical nose guard for teams using the 3‚Äì4 defensive scheme,‚Äù Bright's background issues scared many teams off. He was not selected by any team in the draft. Arena Football League Bright then entered the Arena Football League (AFL), first signing with the Jacksonville Sharks and then, over the course of a year and a half, he played for the Philadelphia Soul, New Orleans VooDoo and the Pittsburgh Power before signing with the Wichita Wild midway through the 2012 season. Playing in all seven of the Wild‚Äôs remaining games last season, Bright tallied 33 total tackles, one and a half sacks and two forced fumbles.

Regular season March 1, 1943, changed the future of Fighting Illini men's basketball when the team was broken up due to all five starters from back-to-back Big Ten Conference championships heading to active duty in the armed forces. The group who left, known as the Whiz Kids, consisted of 21-year-old All-America forward Andy Phillip and 20-year-olds Ken Menke, Gene Vance, Jack Smiley and Art Mathisen. Phillip went on to become a member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. Four of the five, minus Mathisen, returned to Illinois and tried to recapture the glory for one more season in 1946‚Äì47 after the war ended, but the chemistry had changed as well as their talent. Illinois went 14‚Äì6. The 1943‚Äì44 season, however, was a struggle for head coach Doug Mills, as it was the second worst season of his career. The overall record was 11 wins and 9 losses with a conference mark of 5 and 7. The team finished with a 6 - 4 record at home and a .500 record on the road at 5 - 5. The Illini returned only one player from the 1942-43 season, Gordon Horton, who wasn't even a starter, which meant the entire lineup was made up of rookie/unproven players. The starting lineup consisted of Walton Kirk, Howard Judson, Ray DeMoulin, Bob Morton, Don Delaney and Gordon Gillespie.

History NCB was founded in 1956 and led for 40 years by the late John P. Paynter, who was director of bands at Northwestern University, an accomplished arranger, and president of many band organizations, including the Midwest Clinic and the American Bandmasters Association. Highlights of NCB‚Äôs history include performance and clinician appearances at the annual Midwest Clinic in Chicago, performing with the Chicago Symphony Chorus at Orchestra Hall, and many appearances at band festivals and conferences throughout the United States and Europe. Additional highlights include performances with internationally renowned guest artists including Dale Clevenger, Larry Combs, Adolph Herseth, John Houseman, Wynton Marsalis, Allen Vizzutti, and William Warfield. Performances with prominent guest conductors have included Harry Begian, Eugene Migliaro Corporon, Frederick Fennell, Donald Hunsberger, Karel Husa, and H. Robert Reynolds. NCB performs several concerts a year in the Chicago metropolitan area which include a subscription concert series at Northwestern University‚Äôs Pick-Staiger Concert Hall, educational outreach programs at area schools, many summer concerts at the invitation of various communities and venues, and professional band festivals and conferences. The band has toured in Canada and Europe and extensively throughout the United States. In 2001, NCB was the first band from the United States invited to perform at the Festival des Anches d‚ÄôAzur in La Croix Valmer, France. In 2012, the band returned to Europe and performed in Switzerland and Germany on a joint venture with Blasorchester Niederschopfheim, a German community wind band with a 100-year history. NCB musical leadership is provided by Artistic Director, Dr. Mallory Thompson, and Assistant Conductor, Daniel J. Farris. Dr. Thompson first conducted the Northshore Concert Band in April 1999 and was named principal guest conductor that same season. In 2003, Dr. Thompson accepted an expanded role as NCB Artistic Director. Leadership Throughout its history, NCB has promoted the development of community bands. This has been accomplished through performances, recordings, the sponsorship of three adult band conferences, and publication of The Community Band: A Manual of Organization and Operation, which has been used to start or improve many community bands in the United States. In 1987, the NCB became the first recipient of the Sudler Silver Scroll Award from the John Philip Sousa Foundation. The Sudler Scroll recognizes and honors those community bands that have demonstrated particularly high standards of excellence in concert activities over a period of several years, and which have played a significant and leading role in the cultural and musical environment in their respective communities. In November 2003, Meredith Music published a history of NCB entitled On the Path to Excellence: The Northshore Concert Band‚ÄîPaynter, Buehlman and Beyond. Researched and written by Dr. William Carson of Coe College, the book provides a detailed historical record and analysis of the band's first 36 years. Commissions and Recordings As a supporter of new music for wind band NCB has commissioned ten works during its history. NCB has also released ten recordings on CD, seven studio recordings and three live recordings from the annual Midwest Clinic. In 2011, Chicago classical radio station, WFMT, broadcast two programs of live performances from NCB‚Äôs concert series at Pick-Staiger Concert Hall.

In its original airing, \\"Whiskey Business\\" was delayed 25 minutes in Eastern/Central Time Zones due to the end of a NASCAR race at Talladega Superspeedway which was delayed more than 3 hours due to rain. Plot Noticing that Moe has fallen into a bout of suicidal depression, Homer, Marge, Lenny and Carl take him on an excursion to Capital City and buy him a new suit to lift his spirits. His enthusiasm restored, Moe fixes up his bar in order to attract a better class of customers and brings out a batch of homemade whiskey. Two venture capitalists stop by the bar, sample the drink, and are so impressed that they offer to become Moe's business partners in marketing it. Shortly before the new company's initial public offering, his suit is destroyed when he gets caught in an elevator door. Moe appears at the stock exchange in his ordinary clothes and addresses the traders for the IPO, but he inadvertently scares them so badly that his stock price plummets and the company becomes worthless. Returning to his once-again-squalid bar, he brightens up enough to sweep up the pieces of a broken beer mug and forgets about committing suicide, at least for the time being. Meanwhile, Grampa watches the children while Homer and Marge are away. An elaborate prank by Bart, Dolph, Jimbo, and Kearney leads to Grampa being injured, and Bart decides to care for him at home in order to avoid getting in trouble. With Grampa hiding in the basement to avoid being found, the two enjoy playing tricks on Homer. Grampa recovers quickly, but fakes a lingering injury in order to make sure that Bart keeps looking after him. Bart eventually discovers the deception and is angry, but the two reconcile after Grampa explains that he liked getting the sort of personal attention that he never could receive at the nursing home. In order to keep Lisa from finding out about Grampa, Bart sends her to a jazz club where an all-star jam session is taking place. She is shocked to see Bleeding Gums Murphy among the performers, as she knows him to be dead, and discovers that he is actually a hologram. Outraged, she tries to start a boycott of Murphy's record label; shortly afterward, she is surprised to receive a visit from saxophonist Sonny Rollins at home. Rollins explains that holograms are simply the next step in the development of the entertainment industry. Realizing that he too is a hologram sent by the record company, Lisa becomes annoyed when the company proceeds to beam commercials that feature Diana, Princess of Wales, Tupac Shakur and Mahatma Gandhi into her living room. Reception Critical reception This episode received mixed reviews from critics. Robert David Sullivan of The A.V.

I‚Äôm a champion of the episode ‚ÄòHomer‚Äôs Enemy,‚Äô all the way to its grim conclusion, and I love every blood-spurting moment of the Itchy and Scratchy cartoons. But ‚ÄòWhiskey Business‚Äô just bangs on the one note of Moe being so depressed he can‚Äôt even muster the energy to end it all. An episode that actually depicted a suicide would at least win points for going to extremes.\\" Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the episode two and a half stars out of five, saying \\"In addition to the Moe and Lisa plots, the show also tried to shoehorn another story involving Grampa and Bart bonding when Grampa gets injured on Bart's makeshift waterslide. There were some cute moments between the two, but the episode had far too many threads going to make any of them really satisfactory.\\" Ratings The episode received a 1.9 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic and was watched by a total of 4.43 million viewers.

Plot As Homer and Marge's wedding anniversary approaches, Homer remembers how they celebrated their first one: by visiting an outdoor mall and riding its miniature train, \\"Li'l Lisa.\\" Homer visits the mall, intending to bring Marge back for this year's anniversary, but finds that it has become a run-down wreck. Taking the dismantled train home, he enlists his bar buddies and Reverend Lovejoy to help him refurbish it. Meanwhile, Marge goes online to order a batch of Dolly Madison snack cakes for Homer, but inadvertently ends up on a site called Sassy Madison (a parody of Ashley Madison), which helps married people set up affairs. She quickly receives a deluge of invitations from perverted men; while deleting them, she finds a message from a likable guy named Ben and starts talking with him. At first she tries to brush him off, but the two soon find that they share an appreciation for the British drama series Upton Rectory (a spoof of Downton Abbey). Homer continues to work on his train project in secret, alienating Marge. On the day of their anniversary, Homer fakes a back injury and sends Marge across Springfield to pick up a prescription for him. With her gone, he and his friends set up the train to run around the house. As she drives, Marge experiences visions of Ben, mentally pushing them away while bemoaning the state of her marriage at the same time. When she returns home, she sees the train, now renamed \\"Majestic Marge,\\" and forgives Homer. Ben's wife Ramona confronts the couple over Marge's secret correspondence with Ben, but Homer and Marge explain that two people in a healthy relationship should not keep secrets from one another. Homer decides that Marge does not have to tell him how she came to know Ben, and Ramona tells Ben that the two of them are going to become closer by reviewing his computer browser history, much to his surprise. Ben returns to Sassy Madison and makes contact with a new woman, but runs away screaming when she turns out to be Selma.

Marge and Ben's obsession with the costume-drama Upton Rectory perfectly captured the global preoccupation with the PBS show.

Plot Marge attends a parent-principal conference with Principal Skinner, who tells her that Bart might be able to improve his academic performance by taking up a musical instrument. Marge takes Bart to several potential instructors - Sideshow Mel, Comic Book Guy, and Professor Frink - but he ridicules all of them. He becomes infatuated with a young Russian woman named Zhenya, who agrees to give him piano lessons in exchange for Marge teaching her father how to drive so that he can get a driver's license. While Marge makes little progress with Zhenya's father's dangerous habits, word of Bart's rapid progress and emerging musical ability quickly spreads, leading to Zhenya gaining many more students. However, it later emerges that he has only been miming in time with a CD that he has secretly slipped into a player mounted beneath the piano. Feeling neglected because Zhenya has very little time for him due to her other students, Bart publicly confesses to his deception during a talent show. Marge is enraged and disappointed in him until Zhenya's father tells her that he has obtained his license - not by passing the test, but by bribing Patty and Selma with counterfeit jeans. He also convinces Marge to go easy on Bart as he only cheated for love and for his mother. Marge forgives Bart, saying she is proud of him for having told the truth and assuring him that he is unique and it will work out for him in the future.

The new couch is infested by bedbugs and soon Springfield is overrun with them. As Reverend Lovejoy is unable to calm the town, the Parson (last seen on \\"Moe Letter Blues\\") demotes Lovejoy and promotes a new reverend named Elijah Hooper (Edward Norton). The town begins to appreciate Hooper and the cultural references he makes in his sermons. Hooper and Homer bond and Hooper suggests that Homer could be the new church deacon.

Plot Homer and Marge have a lunch date at an up-market sushi restaurant. Marge is excited at the opportunity to have 'grown up people' conversations as the kids are not with them, but Homer is only interested in eating. Enraged, Marge storms out of the restaurant. A worried Homer tries to fix his problems with Marge by finishing a to-do list from within his wallet that Marge had given him. Marge is disappointed because the list is from 6 years earlier. Homer returns to the Japanese restaurant and is given relationship advice by the head chef. Homer takes some food from the restaurant back home and offers it to Marge. She is almost impressed but becomes unhappy when Homer eats the food himself. Unsure of what to do, Homer goes to Moe's Tavern and talks to Moe about his marriage problems. Moe suggests winning her back by exciting her with sex, specifically sadomasochistic sex, as used in Fifty Shades of Grey. Homer goes to the local sex shop where he purchases an array of different sex devices. When he shows Marge all that he has bought she is confused and unimpressed. Homer sits down on one of the machines by mistake and is injured by it. He is taken to the hospital and while he is being treated they reconcile.

She begins to approach him and he becomes excited, but she has only come to the table to tell Bart that Marge had mixed up their lunches. She asks Milhouse if she can eat his cupcake. Having just seen A Streetcar Named Desire for a class assignment, Milhouse takes on the personality of Marlon Brando, and is rude and dismissive towards her, refusing her request for the cupcake. This causes him to win Lisa's respect. Confused as to why his new tactic works, he continues this to keep Lisa interested in him.

Before she can give him an answer she receives a call notifying her she has been fired. Shocked, she tells Milhouse that he should continue pretending to be who he is not, because his regular personality is boring.

The family goes through its contents to find it is full of women's clothes and muscleman magazines belonging to Grampa Simpson. Marge comes to the conclusion that Grampa is a closeted homosexual who was forced to be heterosexual through most of his life. Homer and Marge set Grampa up with Waylon Smithers, but the plan fails when Mr. Burns arrives and scares Smithers off. Marge then admits to Grampa that she thought he was homosexual, to which Grampa becomes enraged and Mr. Burns reveals that Grampa actually used to be an old-time Gorgeous George-type wrestler called \\"Glamorous Godfrey\\", whose radical fighting style was heavily despised by the wrestling fan community, forcing him to retire. Burns reveals himself to be Godfrey's biggest fan (and only living one); he then persuades Grampa to return to the wrestling scene, which Grampa does. Though he is again met with loathing, Grampa continues the act under Burns's manipulation. Bart soon becomes fascinated with Grampa and starts mimicking the mannerisms Grampa uses in the ring. However, he also attracts hatred and it worries Homer and Marge, but pleases Grampa and Burns. Under Burns's supervision, Grampa and Bart partner up in a tag team wrestling match.

Bart gives him a haircut to remove it, but he removes most of Milhouse's hair as a result, making him look just like his father Kirk. With Bart's help, Milhouse dresses up like his dad, becoming taller with the help of homemade stilts made from paint cans and making his voice sound like Kirk's by tying a tie tightly around his neck (though if the tie is put too tightly around his neck, he sounds like Duffman). Bart uses this to his advantage, as Milhouse, looking like an adult, is now able to commit adult activities. They bully Homer, purchase items for school bullies Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph, and participate in municipal voting. When Lisa wishes to go to downtown Springfield, Milhouse is able to buy tickets for himself, Lisa, and Bart. He collects a portion of the class action settlement being paid out to people who bought Baby Poindexter DVDs, but the money he receives is not enough to buy food for the three of them. They are forced to attend a condominium sales presentation for a free breakfast, but find that the doors have been locked to prevent them from leaving. The saleswoman, thinking Milhouse is an adult, attempts to seduce him. Homer and Marge, realizing the children are missing, rush to find them. Homer stops by for the free meal, rescuing the three children by coincidence. Milhouse later apologizes to Kirk for impersonating him, and admits that he wants to grow up to be just like him. Reception Critical reception The episode received mostly positive reviews. Robert David Sullivan of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, saying, \\"We're still a long way past Simpsons episodes with emotional resonance, but plain weirdness works better than the constant cutaways and pop-culture-dropping of last week's episode. Milhouse is not an overused character, and he still has kind of a Charlie Brown quality that allows us to see humor in his adult-like, well-articulated neuroses, so that it doesn't feel as if we're laughing at an actual little boy.\\" Rob Dawson of TV Equals gave the episode a positive review, saying: \\"'Hardly Kirk-ing' is the kind of episode that I wish The Simpsons could pump out every week these days. It's well-constructed and funny, it is what I want late-period The Simpsons to be. It keeps itself together, plays off the larger extended universe of Springfield without seeming like a parade of 'hey, I recognize that guy', and is, most importantly, entertaining.\\" Tom Gammill & Max Pross were nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 66th Writers Guild of America Awards for their script to this episode. Ratings The episode received a 2.0 in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total of 4.57 million viewers. This made it the second most watched show on Fox's Animation Domination line up that night.

In the episode, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), unaware of The Governor (David Morrissey)'s plan to ambush the prison and kill whomever delivers Michonne (Danai Gurira), ponders whether or not he should hand over Michonne to The Governor. Meanwhile, Merle Dixon (Michael Rooker) takes matters into his own hand(s) in an attempt to protect his brother. This episode featured the death of Merle, who is killed when trying to redeem himself. Critics praised the performance of Michael Rooker in the episode and Norman Reedus' performance at the end, upon confronting a zombified Merle. The episode was watched by 10.69 million viewers, up slightly from the previous episode; and critics reacted positively to the episode. Plot Rick privately tells Hershel (Scott Wilson) and Daryl (Norman Reedus) about The Governor's offer and his intentions to hand over Michonne (Danai Gurira), after which he will tell the rest of the group. Hershel refuses to be a part of it, while Daryl reluctantly supports Rick. Rick seeks Daryl's brother Merle to help as well, but he does not think Rick has the spine to do it. Merle later confides in Daryl that he considers Rick's decision hypocritical, since the group had become angry when he had turned Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) over to the Governor. While Rick searches for wire to tie up Michonne, he has another vision of his dead wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), which causes him to reconsider his decision. However, Merle has decided to take the task himself, and he subdues and binds Michonne and sets off in secret to Woodbury. When Daryl finds them missing, he follows along on foot. Merle hot-wires a car and they start to drive towards the arranged meeting spot, with Merle pointing out to Michonne that she is an outsider to the rest of Rick's group like he is. Michonne gets Merle to confess that he had never killed anyone before joining the Governor, and they should return to the prison. Merle has a change of heart, stops the car, and lets Michonne go free. He continues on to the arranged meeting point, while Michonne passes Daryl and informs him where Merle is going. Near the meeting point, Merle uses the car's alarm and radio to slowly parade a line of walkers behind the car. He rigs the car to roll forward to the meeting site while he sneaks out. The Governor's men, including Martinez (Jose Pablo Cantillo), have been waiting to ambush Rick's arrival, and are distracted by the empty car and the walkers. Merle sneaks behind them and kills several, but soon is assaulted by the Governor. The Governor bites off two of his fingers, but Merle refuses to beg for mercy. The Governor shoots and kills him. At the prison, Glenn receives Hershel's permission to marry Maggie, and then proposes to her, using a wedding ring taken from one of the walkers at the prison fence. Rick arrives and tells the group of the offer to turn over Michonne but that he couldn't go through with it. He admits he made the decision on his own, and shouldn't have, not wanting to be a Governor. He asks the group to decide if they want to stay at the prison or leave, and leaves to go stand watch as they make their decision. There, he watches as Michonne returns to the prison. At the meeting spot, Daryl arrives and clears out a few remaining walkers before coming across a reanimated Merle. Daryl cries at his loss, and as the walker approaches him, Daryl slams it to the ground and stabs Merle in the face several times before becoming visibly upset. Production Michael Rooker (pictured in 2013) made his final appearance as a series regular in \\"This Sorrowful Life\\". Critics applauded Norman Reedus' performance in the episode. The episode was directed by Greg Nicotero and written by Scott M. Gimple and shares its name with the sixth volume of the comics. This episode marks the last appearance of Michael Rooker (Merle), who was killed off in the episode, when he is shot in the chest by The Governor (David Morrissey) and was stabbed in the head multiple times by Daryl (Norman Reedus) after reanimating. On the decision to kill Merle, Robert Kirkman explained: > It's important to note that running out of story isn't a reason to kill a > character. Having more story to mine isn't a reason to keep a character > alive; it's what story comes out of it and how does the story change with > death. Daryl Dixon has become a very important character in the show and his > character had changed and evolved in very interesting ways over the course > of the first three seasons. Having Merle back was always planned to be > somewhat temporary thing. We wanted to see how Merle's return would affect > that character and seeing Daryl revert to past behavior -- to bad behavior > -- was something we really wanted to explore. But in the end, Daryl had > moved past that character and we wanted to get back to him not having that > brother altering his behavior moving forward or influencing him in any way. > Merle's death was really about activating Daryl in an interesting way that > will pay off in season four.

Eric Goldman at IGN gave the episode 9 out of 10, specifically praising the performances of actors Danai Gurira, Michael Rooker, Steven Yeun, and Norman Reedus.

History and geography The bottom of Chott el Fejej lies below sea level and runs in a narrow path from the main body of Chott el Djerid to the Tunisian desert oasis of El Hamma, near the Gulf of Gab√®s on the Mediterranean Sea. The distance from the point where the Chott el Fejej joins the Chott el Djerid to its end near El Hamma is approximately . Along its length, Chott el Fejej never widens beyond and in many places is considerably more narrow. The easterly end of the Chott el Fejej is separated from Mediterranean by an approximately wide ridge of sand near El Hamma. It was this narrow sandy ridge, separating the Chott el Fejej from the Mediterranean Sea, which brought it to the attention of various geographers, engineers and diplomats. These figures looked to create an inland \\"Sahara Sea\\" by channelling the waters of the Mediterranean into Sahara Desert basins which lay below sea level. A noted proposal to this effect was put forward in the late 1800s by French geographer Fran√ßois √âlie Roudaire and the creator of the Suez Canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, but stalled after the French government withdrew funding. Later proposals, made as part of Operation Plowshare, posited that nuclear explosives could be used to dig the proposed canal from the Mediterranean to the Chott el Fejej and other below-sea-level basins of the Sahara; these proposals were also fruitless. Geology The Chott el Fejej is a typical chott, or dry lake, of the Sahara. It is underlain, however, by a major anticline known as the Fejej Dome. This anticline and other surrounding structures are argued to be the result of rifting in the Cretaceous period.

Jean-Pierre Berthom√© and Frnancois Thomas, Orson Welles at Work (Phaidon, London, 2008) pp.231, 282-3 Plot The film was due to be a one- hour adaptation of an Isak Dinesen story of the same name, from her collection Winter's Tales (1942). It would have starred Oja Kodar as a young French aristocratic widow during the 1870 Franco-Prussian War. After being arrested by the Prussians in Sarre, she would have been allowed to proceed to France, but a Prussian officer would have offered a passport to all the French prisoners if she would come to collect hers naked. Production Late in 1966, Welles had filmed another one-hour Dinesen adaptation The Immortal Story, for French television. It would not be transmitted (or released in other territories) until 1968, and while editing was still underway on the project, Welles decided to shoot one or two more Dinesen stories so that they could be combined with The Immortal Story as a feature-length anthology film, and secure a theatrical release. The film was financed by London-based Hungarian producer Alexander Paal and the Hungarian state film production board, and Welles brought in cinematographer Willy Kurant, whom he would subsequently work with again on The Deep.

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. It is composed of the elected five-member Board of Supervisors, several other elected offices including the Sheriff, District Attorney, and Assessor, and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Executive Officer. Some chartered cities such as Sacramento and Folsom provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as Rancho Cordova and Isleton arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis. In addition, several entities of the government of California have jurisdiction conterminous with Sacramento County, such as the Sacramento County Superior Court.  Organization   Board of Supervisors  Under its foundational Charter, the five-member elected Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (BOS) is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and quasi- judicial capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process. The current members are: * Phil Serna‚ÄîDistrict 1 * Patrick Kennedy‚ÄîDistrict 2 * Susan Peters‚ÄîDistrict 3, Vice Chair * Sue Frost‚ÄîDistrict 4 * Don Nottoli‚ÄîDistrict 5, Chair  Elected officers  In addition to the Board of Supervisors, there are several elected officers that form the Government of Sacramento County that are required by the California Constitution and California law, and authorized under the Charter. The Sacramento County Sheriff's Department provides general-service law enforcement to unincorporated areas of Sacramento County, serving as the equivalent of the county police for unincorporated areas of the county, as well as incorporated cities within the county who have contracted with the agency for law-enforcement services (known as \\"contract cities\\"). The Sacramento County District Attorney prosecutes felony and misdemeanor crimes that occur within the jurisdiction of Sacramento County. The Sacramento County Assessor determines the assessed valuation of property in the county. The Sacramento County Board of Education is composed of seven elected members who serve four-year terms. It governs the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE), and appoints the Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools who is also its secretary.

The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) operates health, social, and mental health services for Sacramento County. The Department of Human Assistance (DHA) administers multiple California welfare programs within Sacramento County, including Medi-Cal, CalFresh, CalWORKs, general assistance, a Medically Indigent Service Program (MISP), and recently a Low Income Health Program (LIHP) Medicaid Coverage Expansion (MCE) program. The Department of Community Development interprets/enforces California Building Codes for privately owned buildings and structures including commercial and residential new buildings, alterations, additions and/or repairs within Sacramento County‚Äôs unincorporated area, investigates housing, zoning and vehicle abatement laws in the unincorporated Sacramento County, performs County Surveyor functions, and oversees most aspects of local land use planning in the unincorporated area of Sacramento County. The Department of Water Resources provides drainage, flood control and water supply services to various service areas of unincorporated Sacramento County and the Cities of Citrus Heights, Elk Grove and Rancho Cordova.  Law  The Sacramento County Code is the codified law of the County in the form of ordinances passed by the Board of Supervisors. Every act prohibited or declared unlawful, and every failure to perform an act required, by the ordinances are misdemeanor crimes, unless otherwise specified as infractions.California Government Code ¬ß 25132.  History  The current charter was proposed by the Sacramento County Board of Freeholders and ratified by the electorate on and became effective .  Other governments   California  The Sacramento County Superior Court, which covers the entire county, is not a County department but a division of the State's trial court system. Historically, the courthouses were county- owned buildings that were maintained at county expense, which created significant friction since the trial court judges, as officials of the state government, had to lobby the county Board of Supervisors for facility renovations and upgrades. In turn, the state judiciary successfully persuaded the state Legislature to authorize the transfer of all courthouses to the state government in 2008 and 2009 (so that judges would have direct control over their own courthouses). Courthouse security is still provided by the county government under a contract with the state.  Sacramento  The government of Sacramento operates as a charter city (as opposed to a general law city) under the Charter of the City of Sacramento. The elected government is composed of the Sacramento City Council with 15 city council districts and the Mayor of Sacramento, which operate under a mayor-council government. In addition, there are numerous departments and appointed officers such as the City Manager, Sacramento Police Department (SPD), the Sacramento Fire Department (SFD), Community Development Department, City Clerk, City Attorney, and City Treasurer.

Special districts  The Sacramento Local Agency Formation Commission (SacLAFCo) is the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) for Sacramento County and regulates special districts. The Sacramento Regional Transit District (RT) is responsible for public transportation and is governed by an eleven-member Board of Directors composed of members of the Sacramento, Elk Grove, Citrus Heights, Rancho Cordova, and Folsom City Councils as well as members of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors. Electricity for the county is provided by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District.

Meanwhile, the practical MT system MT-IT-EC specific to communication domain was also striking to notice, for it has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity in the issue of publications. Government funding is a critical component and support in the development of market-oriented machine translation in China. It is evident to see that since Chinese opened up to the outside world and joined the WTO, the vigorous import and export trade generate opportunities for machine translation to transfer technical terms of products into the readable target information. Facing the increasing demand of sophisticated state-of -the -art translation technology, the academic area including research institute and universities are even launching bachelors‚Äô and masters‚Äô programs regarding machine translation.

Design High Hollow's design is derived in-part from Howe's thesis while studying under Victor Laloux at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in France. Initial construction began in 1914, while Howe was apprenticed with the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Furness, Evans & Co., and was completed in 1917, during his time with Mellor Meigs & Howe. The design is of European influence, particularly Italian and French, hinting at Howe's roots in the Beaux Arts, but it does not conform to any specific style of the time. Rather, High Hollow lends itself more to its surroundings then to any architectural genre. A local quarry was even reopened, just to supply the purplish stone used in its construction. Bordering Fairmount Park and overlooking the Wissahickon Valley, High Hollow is often regarded as Howe's most significant residential work and viewed by many as setting the standard for house design in the region through the early 20th Century. Famed architect and educator Robert A. M. Stern referred to the house as being \\"often imitated\\" and \\"never surpassed\\" by those that came to design in a similar style. Renowned American blacksmith Samuel Yellin, who was frequently commissioned by Mellor, Miegs & Howe, fabricated all of the intricate metalwork at the estate. Other Occupants When Howe left Mellor, Meigs & Howe in 1928, he sold High Hollow to cigar mogul Samuel Paley (see La Palina) and his artist-philanthropist wife, Goldie Paley. The Paley's were the parents of William Paley, who was instrumental in establishing the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as the largest radio and television network in The United States. The Paleys lived at High Hollow for 20 years, after which they donated the property to the University of Pennsylvania, which in turn sold the property to a private owner. The site was put on sheriff's auction in 2016. See also * Glenays - The addition (1925) and garden walls (1928) were designed by George Howe.

Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182 (2012), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the United States government, when it enters into a contract with a Native American (Indian) tribe for services, must pay contracts in full, even if Congress has not appropriated enough money to pay all tribal contractors. (hereafter cited as Ramah Navajo Chapter). The case was litigated over a period of 22 years, beginning in 1990, until it was decided in 2012.  Background  Location of Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation (Navajo reservations shown by orange color; green, red, and purple are Apache.) The Ramah Navajo Chapter is a political subdivision of the Navajo tribe that resides on the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation in the western part of New Mexico, just east and southeast of the Zuni Indian Reservation. This is the eastern part of the Navajo Nation, which extends westward into Arizona and Utah. The Navajo Nation is divided into five \\"Agencies\\" and further sub- divided into \\"Chapters\\", which are comparable with county governments., 103 (2003). The Navajo Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled members.Bill Donovan, Census: Navajo Enrollment Tops 300,000, , Jul. 7, 2011. The Ramah Chapter, due to its location, is the only Navajo Chapter with its own Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) agency and a semi-autonomous government., at 13; Kathryn D. Manuelito, A Dine (Navajo) Perspective on Self-Determination: An Exposition of an Egalitarian Place, , Spring-Summer 2006, at 7, 10. \\"[T]he Ramah Navajos played a leadership role in defending indigenous self- determination efforts in the United States\\",Manuelito, at 13. beginning with the establishment of a reservation school over the protests of local non- Indians.Manuelito, at 10-13.  Legislative background  In 1975, Congress passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (IDEAA).Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, , (codified at ); Mary Jensen, Contracts Formed under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act Are as Binding as Any Other Government Agreements with a Contractor: Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. Leavitt, (2005-2006). IDEAA authorized the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to contract with Native American tribes to take over services that had, in the past, been provided by the BIA and the Indian Health Service (IHS), among others.Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Lujan, 112 F.3d 1455, 1456 (10th Cir. 1997) (hereafter cited as RNC v. Lujan); Lloyd B. Miller, A Most Unusual Alliance: Indian Tribes and Military Contractors Vindicate First Principles in the Ramah Litigation (2012). The stated intent of IDEAA was to improve tribal self-determination in planning and managing federally funded programs for tribal members.Ramah Navajo Tribe v. Salazar, 644 F.3d 1054, 1058 (10th Cir. 2011) (hereafter cited as RNC v. Salazar); RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1456-57; Miller, at 48. The Secretary of the Interior was responsible for administering these contracts out of monies appropriated by Congress. The contracts required two parts, first the direct cost of the program being administered by the tribe, and second, indirect costs of administering the program, subject to funds being appropriated by Congress.Remah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct at 2187; , 16 (1999); Miller, at 48. When there were shortfalls in the amounts paid by BIA to the tribe, the agency would underpay the tribe for indirect costs, forcing the tribes to cut services to tribal members to pay the indirect costs.Miller, at 48.  Procedural history  In 1989, the Ramah Navajo Chapter had five contracts with the BIA to administer programs relating to real estate, natural resources, law enforcement, the Aid to Tribal Government program, and water rights programs.Jensen, at 413. Additionally, the Chapter had two contracts with the State of New Mexico to administer a juvenile justice restitution program and a criminal justice program. In determining the indirect costs to be reimbursed to the Chapter, the BIA used both the federal and state grants, which came to $336,317.65. This was about $28,000 less than the amount that would be reimbursed using only the BIA grants.RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1458-59. The BIA used this method to artificially reduce the amount of indirect costs that it would have to pay to the tribes. Due to the dispute over indirect costs, the Chapter filed a contract appeal with the BIA in 1990.RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1459. The BIA denied the appeal, noting even so that the Chapter was correct that including the state grants in the calculation was contrary to law. = District court = On October 4, 1990, the Chapter filed a lawsuit for breach of contract in the New Mexico Federal District Court.Remah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct at 2188; RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1459. The suit asked for compensatory damages and injunctive relief, and for certification as a class action case. In 1993, the district court granted the United States summary judgment and denied the Chapter's motion for summary judgment. A final judgment was entered on October 19, 1994, and the Chapter appealed. = Circuit court of appeals = The appeal was heard by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. The circuit court held that the 1988 amendment to IDEAA was intended to correct the chronic underfunding of BIA and IHS contracts with tribes, especially in regards to indirect costs.RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1457-58; , at 34-35. The circuit court noted that normally, when dealing with an ambiguous federal statute, courts will defer to the administrative agency charged with implementing the statute.RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1461; Scott C. Hall, The Indian Law Canons of Construction v. The Chevron Doctrine: Congressional Intent and the Umambiguous Answer to the Ambiguous Problem (2004-2005). Indian tribes are treated differently‚Äîthe court noted that it has long been a principle of American jurisprudence that ambiguous statutes are to be construed in favor of the tribes.RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1461; , (2007); Jensen, at 413-14. The circuit court ruled on May 8, 1997, that the government's interpretation of the statute was unreasonable, and reversed and remanded the case to the district court.Remah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct at 2188; RNC v. Lujan, 112 F.3d at 1457-58; , at 20 n.5; Jensen, at 413. = District court on remand = On remand, both the United States and the Chapter entered into settlement talks, eventually settling a portion of the claims. On May 25, 1999, the district court entered a final judgment on the partial settlement, finding for the Chapter and the other tribes in the class for $79,903,529 on the partial claim, $8,338,000 in attorney's fees, and $170,036 in costs.Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Babbitt, 50 F. Supp. 2d 1091 (D.N.M. 1999) (hereafter cited as RNC v. Babbitt); Dean, at 374. On December 6, 2002, the district court entered a final judgement on most of the remaining issues, finding for the Chapter and the other tribes in the class for $29,000,000 on the claims, $5,800,000 in attorney's fees, and $243,496 in costs.Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Norton, 250 F. Supp. 2d 1303, 1317-18 (D.N.M. 2002) (hereafter cited as RNC v. Norton). This narrowed the dispute to whether the plaintiff tribes could collect on the underpaid amounts and the way the statute was interpreted. The district court granted summary judgment to the government, and the Chapter appealed.RNC v. Salazar, 644 F.3d at 1062. = Circuit court, second appeal = The circuit court noted that this was an issue on how the statute was to be interpreted. First, the court noted that the statute required the Secretary of the Interior to add the full amount of indirect, contract support costs to the contract.RNC v. Salazar, 644 F.3d at 1058. Beginning in 1994, Congress began to cap the total amount of funds that could be used for IDEAA contracts. This amount was insufficient to cover the contracts with all Indian tribes, but was sufficient to cover each individual contract that was entered into by BIA. The court noted that when construing a statute dealing with Indian tribes, the statute is to be construed to the favor of the tribe over the more general canon requiring deference to agency determinations. The court then held that since there were sufficient funds to pay each individual contract in full, the government was obligated to do so. The circuit court reversed and remanded the decision of the district court, ruling in favor of the Chapter.RNC v. Salazar, 644 F.3d at 1077.  Supreme Court  The BIA appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari to hear the case in order to settle a circuit split.Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. 995 (2012).  Arguments of the parties  = United States = The United States was represented by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General. Freeman argued that Congress had placed a cap on IDEAA contract funds beginning in 1994, and the BIA did not have the authority to spend more than the capped amount on all of the IDEAA contracts.Pet'r's Br. 7, available as 2012 WL 596117 (U.S.) (Appellate Brief); Miller, at 49. Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available funds on a pro rata basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. Art. I, ¬ß 9, cl. 7; Pet'r's Br. at 19. Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past the amount of money that Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts.Pet'r's Br. at 30. The government also stated that the contract did not create a binding promise to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.Pet'r's Br. at 45. = Ramah Chapter = The Ramah Navajo Chapter was represented by Carter G. Phillips, who argued that this was a simple contract case to which the Ferris doctrine applied. The Chapter contracted with the United States to perform a service and completed its obligations, and the United States breached the contract by refusing to pay according to the terms of the contract.Appellant's Br. 1-2, available as 2012 WL 957502 (U.S.) (Appellate Brief). The statute, in addition to establishing that contract support costs were to be paid, also mandated the use of a model contract, reducing the BIA's ability to modify the terms of the contract.Appellant's Br. at 7. To allow the government to breach would be bad public policy, where no contractor to the government could be assured of receiving payment.Appellant's Br. at 15-16. Phillips noted that the statute was clear, and if it was not, the canons of statutory construction required that the ambiguity be resolved in the tribes favor.Appellant's Br. at 24. = Amicus curiae = Amicus curiae briefs were filed in support of the Chapter by the National Congress of American Indians (joined by the Coalition of Indian Tribes and Tribal Organizations), the Arctic Slope Native Association, and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America (joined by the National Defense Industrial Association). No amicus briefs were filed in support of the United States.Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, (last visited October 15, 2015).  Opinion of the court  Justice Sonia Sotomayor, author of the majority opinionJustice Sonia Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court. Sotomayor first noted that this was not a case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2188. Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. LeavittCherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt, . held that when the government makes a contractual promise to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2188; Miller, at 49. This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the \\"principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States.\\"Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2189; Miller, at 49. If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2190-91. Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, but it is an issue for Congress to resolve.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2195. The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.Debra Cassens Weiss, Supreme Court Supports Tribes in Reimbursement Dispute in Ruling with Unusual Lineup, (online), Jun. 18, 2012; Rob Capriccioso, Supreme Court: Government Must Pay Tribal Contract Support Costs, , Jul. 19, 2012. Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2186, 2195.  Dissent  Chief Justice John Roberts, author of the dissentChief Justice of the United States John Roberts dissented from the majority opinion. Roberts asserted that the Court's decision would cause the BIA to exceed the monetary limits for the IDEAA contracts, which were set by Congress under its appropriation authority. In addition, Roberts noted that Congress expressly forbade the BIA from reducing payments to other tribes and programs to pay an IDEAA contract.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2195-96 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Roberts would have distinguished Cherokee Nation from this case because Cherokee Nation did not have a similar restriction on reducing other payments.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2197 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Consequently, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that he would have reversed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2199 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Roberts was joined in his dissent by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Samuel Alito.Ramah Navajo Chapter, 132 S.Ct. at 2195, 2199 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).  Subsequent developments  Immediately after the decision was reached in the Supreme Court, tribes began to press the United States for payments. The Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, Bill John Baker, met with U.S. President Barack Obama on July 20, 2012 to discuss the issue.Chase Cook, Cherokee Leaders Meet with President Obama, , Jul. 20, 2012. After several years of negotiations, the federal government agreed to pay $940,000,000 to settle the remaining claims in the lawsuit.Summary Notice of Final Settlement, Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Jewell, No. 1:90-CV-00957-JAP/KBM (D.N.M. 2015).  Footnotes   References   External links  * *Oral argument, Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, courtesy of Oyez.org *Opinion announcement, Salazar v.

It won the 1980 Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize for Fiction and was nominated for both the American Book Awards and the National Book Critics Circle Award.Bail, Paul (1998) Anne Tyler: A Critical Companion Westport, Connecticut:Greenwood Press Plot summary Morgan Gower is a middle-aged husband and father who works at Cullen's Hardware Store. Morgan's life is boring: His house is dominated by his wife and daughters who generally ignore him, and his workplace is too slow for his active mind, his wit, and his imagination. In short, his life has fallen far short of his heroic aspirations, and he keeps a closet full of costumes--priest, riverboat gambler, Daniel Boone outfits--donning a different costume nearly every day, wandering the streets of Baltimore, a man in search of an identity in which he feels comfortable. One day, he meets a young couple, Emily and Leon Meredith, performing their puppet show in public. Emily goes into labor right after the show, and Morgan (posing as Doctor Morgan) delivers the baby in the backseat of his car. Over the next couple of years, an increasingly bored Morgan frequently runs into the couple \\"accidentally on purpose.\\" He stalks them and over a period of time becomes their friend. Leon and Emily are not the happy couple that they appeared to be; Leon is a frustrated actor who has been reduced to a puppeteer. Emily seems uncertain of what she wants but it isn't Leon. Morgan initially tries to befriend them both (and their daughter Gina) but over several years becomes entranced with Emily. He spends more and more time with his new companions, and his wife and daughters barely notice his absence. Eventually Emily and Morgan sneak around their spouses, she becomes pregnant by Morgan, and they run off together to a new life, Morgan finally content as he assumes Leon's identity. Reviews John Leonard of The New York Times said, \\"Morgan, like a novelist, wants to be everybody else in order to look at himself through innocent eyes, to be charmed....Miss Tyler, witty, civilized, curious, with her radar ears and her quill pen dipped on one page in acid and on the next in orange liqueur, is asking whether art is adequate to the impersonations life insists on, death absolves. She is a wonderful writer.\\" In The New York Review of Books, James Wolcott compared Tyler to a \\"sentry or a detective [who] seems to notice everything: the pale fluorescent gloom of laundromats, pockets filled with lint-covered jellybeans, the smell of crabcakes and coconut oil on a Delaware beach, grapy veins in the calves of middle-aged mothers.

Following a successful high school career, Nelson committed to the University of Minnesota. After two seasons as a Golden Gopher, Nelson transferred to Rutgers for a more pass-heavy offensive attack. However, before Nelson started with Rutgers, he committed fifth degree misdemeanor assault by participating in a fight outside of a bar in Mankato, Minnesota on Sunday, May 11, 2014, in which he left a man with permanent brain damage by kicking the man in the head while he was on the ground unconscious. As a result of his actions he was dismissed from the Rutgers football program following his entering of a guilt plea in which he admitted his actions. Nelson had two years of eligibility left to play collegiate football when he enrolled at East Carolina as a senior in the hopes of a getting spot on the football team. After spring football training camp, Nelson received the starting quarterback position for the Pirates. In his only season at East Carolina, Nelson posted career numbers for completions, completion percentage, yards, touchdowns, and passer rating. Though the Pirates only went 3‚Äì7 with Nelson under center, the team did win a rivalry game against NC State 33‚Äì30.http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/gamelog/_/id/530738/philip- nelson Shortly after graduating from East Carolina, Nelson attended the Winnipeg Blue Bombers spring mini-camp but was cut before main training camp. He played for the San Diego Fleet of the Alliance of American Football (AAF) in 2019, and for the Dallas Renegades of the XFL in 2020. Early years Nelson attended Mankato West High School in Mankato, Minnesota. There he was a standout member of the football team, setting several state records on his way to winning the 2011 Minnesota Mr. Football Award. He is the son of Pat and Norma Nelson. Nelson was scouted by Football Bowl Subdivision scouts during his junior year in high school. It was originally perceived that Nelson would be a very sought-after recruit during his senior year by numerous Big Ten schools and was highly regarded by recruiting expert Tom Lemming. Nelson conducted initial visits to a handful of schools to include Iowa State, Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota.http://www.startribune.com/sports/gophers/137638868.html Upon visiting Minnesota in December 2010, Nelson received his first scholarship offer from Minnesota Head Coach Jerry Kill. Nelson committed to Minnesota on February 19, 2011. College career Minnesota On October 20, 2012, Nelson's redshirt was pulled after struggling starter MarQueis Gray was injured the week before. Nelson's first game of his collegiate career came against the Wisconsin Badgers. The Gophers lost the game but Nelson passed for two touchdowns and was also the Gophers' leading rusher in the game. Nelson started the final seven games as a true freshman at Minnesota going 2‚Äì5 and the Gophers were invited to a bowl game for the first time since 2009. They lost in the Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas to Texas Tech 34‚Äì31 on December 28, 2012. In Nelson's sophomore season, he endured peaks and valleys as the starting quarterback. He played in 12 games and led the Gophers to a 4‚Äì0 record at the beginning of the season. A hamstring injury against Iowa hampered Nelson's ability to be effective against the Hawkeyes. The Gophers lost 23‚Äì7. The next week against Michigan, back up quarterback Mitch Leidner took most of the reps but the Gophers were dismantled 42‚Äì13. Now on a losing streak and with ailing coach Jerry Kill watching from a private box, the Gophers hoped to get back on track against Northwestern. Leidner was replaced by a healthy Nelson in the first half of that game and the Gophers hung on for a 20‚Äì17 victory. Nelson would start the next four games and lead the Gophers to three signature victories over No. 24 ranked Nebraska, Indiana, and Penn State. The last two games of the season saw Nelson and Leidner split snaps as the team lost to Michigan State and then Syracuse in the Texas Bowl on December 28, 2013. Rutgers On January 16, 2014, after a trying season, uncertainty at the starting quarterback position, and with Kill dealing with numerous epilepsy episodes, Nelson announced he was transferring from Minnesota; he would still have two years to play for a new team. On January 29, 2014 Nelson transferred to Rutgers. On May 13, 2014, he was dismissed from Rutgers following assault charges leading to a guilty plea for a fifth degree misdemeanor. East Carolina In August 2015, Nelson walked on at East Carolina after soliciting interest from other teams. After winning the starting quarterback job, Nelson and the Pirates started the season 2‚Äì0 with wins against in-state rivals, Western Carolina and NC State. Nelson threw a combined six touchdown passes and ran for one score in those two matchups. However, following a loss with South Carolina the next week, the ECU squad would only win one more game the rest of the season. After the season came to a close, Nelson was invited to participate in the 2017 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. Nelson was named the National team's MVP as he led his squad on a 14-play scoring drive in the opening series of the game. Professional career Winnipeg Blue Bombers In January 2018, Nelson signed with the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers to compete for the fourth-string backup quarterback position. He was cut from the team in May before training camp. San Diego Fleet In the third round of the inaugural AAF QB Draft, Nelson was picked by the San Diego Fleet with the eighth selection. Nelson began the 2019 AAF season as the Fleet's second-string quarterback behind Mike Bercovici. After Bercovici struggled for much of the season opener against the San Antonio Commanders, Nelson relieved him late in the game, completing 5 of 10 passes for 68 yards and an interception in the 15‚Äì6 loss. Nelson was eventually named the starter for the following week's game against the Atlanta Legends. In his first start against the Atlanta Legends, he completed 14 of 30 passes for 142 and an interception as the Fleet won 24‚Äì12. The following week's matchup against the Commanders saw Nelson throw an interception on the first play before rebounding with two touchdown passes in a 31‚Äì11 San Diego victory. During the fourth game against the Memphis Express, Nelson threw a touchdown before exiting in the second quarter with a shoulder injury; he was replaced by Alex Ross as the Fleet fell 26‚Äì23. The injury, later revealed to be a clavicle fracture, sidelined Nelson for the next month, and he was eventually placed on injured reserve. The league ceased operations in April 2019. Dallas Renegades Nelson was taken by the Dallas Renegades with the 52nd pick of the 2020 XFL Draft. Nelson started in a week 1 15‚Äì9 loss to the St. Louis Battlehawks following an injury to starting quarterback Landry Jones. Nelson started again in a week 5 30‚Äì12 loss to the New York Guardians after another injury to starting quarterback Landry Jones. He had his contract terminated when the league suspended operations on April 10, 2020.

The argument allegedly involved conversation surrounding a bar bouncer hitting on Nelson's girlfriend. Other people around the area reported that Nelson allegedly kicked Kolstad while he was unconscious, following being punched by a third party, Trevor Shelley. Shelley, also facing first- and third-degree assault charges, told police he did not hit Kolstad. Kolstad was left unable to breathe on his own following significant destruction of brain tissue and underwent surgeries. Surveillance video of the fight shows Kolstad throwing the first punch, knocking Nelson to the ground. The fight lasted eight seconds. Nelson, age 20, and Kolstad were both intoxicated, according to police. Kolstad's injuries included a skull fracture, brain shifting, brain bleeding and lung deterioration due to lack of oxygen. Kolstad moved home with his wife and two daughters in 2014. Kolstad suffered permanent brain damage. Nelson pleaded guilty to lesser charges and reached a civil settlement with Kolstad in 2018.https://www.mankatofreepress.com/news/local_news/final- settlement-tentatively-reached-in-kolstad-civil- suit/article_19721c5c-f653-11e7-bc61-27cad4f2f862.html References External links * * Minnesota profile * East Carolina bio Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Dallas Renegades players Category:East Carolina Pirates football players Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers football players Category:People from DeForest, Wisconsin Category:Players of American football from Minnesota Category:Players of American football from Wisconsin Category:San Diego Fleet players Category:Sportspeople from Mankato, Minnesota ","title":"Philip Nelson (American football)"},{"id":"37899573","text":"Georgy Anatolevich Doniyakh (–î–æ–Ω–∏—è—Ö –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á, 1914‚Äì1976) was a Russian conductor.Bio and photos (Russian) He graduated from the Leningrad Conservatory in 1943, and later became director of the Orchestra of the Uzbek SSR.100 –ª–µ—Ç –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –∫–æ–Ω—Å–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, 1862-1962, p. 238, 1962 \\"–î–æ–Ω–∏—è—Ö –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á (—Ä. 1914). –û–∫–æ–Ω—á–∏–ª 1943 –ø–æ –∫–ª. –¥–∏—Ä–∏–∂–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ò. –®–µ—Ä–º–∞–Ω–∞. 1952 ‚Äî 56 –ø—Ä–µ–ø–æ–¥–∞–≤–∞–ª –¥–∏—Ä–∏–∂–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –¥—É—Ö. –æ—Ä–∫. 1950 –∑–∞—Å–ª. –¥–µ—è—Ç. –∏—Å–∫. –£–∑–±–µ–∫—Å–∫–æ–π –°–°–†.\\"–ò–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏–Ω—Å—Ç—Ä—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ ... ‚Äì p. 172 –í. –ö. –°—É—Ö–æ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤ ‚Äì 2000 \\"–í –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–µ –≥–æ–¥—ã, 1958‚Äì1971, –æ—Ä–∫–µ—Å—Ç—Ä –≤–æ–∑–≥–ª–∞–≤–∏–ª –ó–∞—Å–ª—É–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤ –£–∑–±–µ–∫—Å–∫–æ–π –°–°–† –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –î–æ–Ω–∏—è—Ö (1914‚Äì1976). –¢–≤–æ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∏–Ω–¥–∏–≤–∏–¥—É–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ì.–ê. –î–æ–Ω–∏—è—Ö–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—è–≤–∏–ª–∞—Å—å –≤ —Ä—è–¥–µ –ø—Ä–µ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ ...\\" He was the Chief Conductor of the Maly Opera Theatre, and would have been the conductor of Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk had it been produced according to schedule.DSCH journal ‚Äì N 20 23 ‚Äì p. 35, 2004 \\"(Note by Anthony Phillips) [4] Georgy Doniyakh was the Chief Conductor of the Maly Opera Theatre, and would have been the conductor of Lady Macbeth had it been produced at the time.\\"–ü–∏—Å—å–º–∞ –∫ –¥—Ä—É–≥—É: –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –®–æ—Å—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏—á –ò—Å–∞–∞–∫—É –ì–ª–∏–∫–º–∞–Ω—É ‚Äì p. 112, –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–π –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–∏–µ–≤–∏—á –®–æ—Å—Ç–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏—á, –ò—Å–∞–∞–∫ –î–∞–≤–∏–¥–æ–≤–∏—á –ì–ª–∏–∫–º–∞–Ω ‚Äì 1993 \\"3 –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –î–æ–Ω–∏—è—Ö –±—ã–ª –≤ —Ç—É –ø–æ—Ä—É –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω—ã–º –¥–∏—Ä–∏–∂–µ—Ä–æ–º –ú–∞–ª–æ–≥–æ –æ–ø–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä–∞ –∏ –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω –±—ã–ª –¥–∏—Ä–∏–∂–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –æ–ø–µ—Ä–æ–π ¬´–õ–µ–¥–∏ –ú–∞–∫–±–µ—Ç¬ª.

On the website, it claims that the council was formed to achieve \\"Unity in the Motorcycle Community\\". They serve a similar function to the Ohio-based American Motorcyclist Association, which is the largest group of its kind in the United States. Background Incorporated in November 2006, C.M.S.C. formed with the vision of becoming an organization that helps existing clubs work together and new motorcycle clubs form properly, making them an organization of organizations. All of the member organizations must \\"have a common love of the sport of Motorcycle Riding.\\" The member clubs are predominantly African American sport bike clubs, but have no defined race restrictions, defining themselves as multi-cultural, and hold no restrictions as to the class of motorcycles preferred by member clubs. C.M.S.C. is a non-profit organization. In the biker community, a club which gains membership in C.M.S.C. essentially allows its clubs to operate with the recognition of MC's, or Outlaw motorcycle clubs. This recognition is important to a respective club's survival as not being a direct threat to territory under the control of an outlaw club. Instead of generating money for their organizations through criminal activities, they do so by throwing parties and sponsoring community events, which are often charitable. C.M.S.C. is a non- profit organization and they host an annual awards banquet every December, called the Unity Party. They also sponsor a bike blessing each spring and other events through the year.

Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 n (Works number W142/I) 1937‚Äì1938  The standard-wheelbase version of the W142 shared its wheelbase with the standard lengthened versions of its predecessor, but a more streamlined form with longer overhangs meant that even in this form the W142 was substantially longer and indeed wider than the earlier car. The front grill was gently raked backwards, and there was no longer a bar in front of it to carry lights, all of which gave the car a more sporting look than the model it replaced. Power came from a newly enlarged straight six 3,208 cc side-valve engine with a listed maximum output of at 4,000 rpm, supporting a claimed top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). This was delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission which, unusually in the 1930s, incorporated synchromesh on all four ratios. The footbrake used a hydraulic control mechanism and operated on all four wheels. The suspension set-up was carried over from the W18 with a swing axle at the rear and the front axle suspended with a central transverse leaf spring and coil springs beside the wheels.Oswald, p. 261 Customers wishing to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a standard-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,500 Marks. Otherwise the choice of standard bodies was restricted to a three-seat cabriolet (known as the \\"Cabriolet A\\") or a coup√©-bodied equivalent with a removable roof, priced respectively at 11,800 Marks or 12,300 Marks.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/II) 1937‚Äì1938  Longer-bodied cars came with an extra of wheelbase, and Mercedes-Benz offered a choice from a wide range of standard body options for the longer cars. Customers happy to make their own arrangements in respect of bodywork could buy a longer-wheelbase W142 in base chassis form at the manufacturer's listed price of 6,800 Marks, or 300 Marks more than the price of the shorter chassis. The entry level model with a Mercedes-Benz body included in the price was the four-door ‚ÄùLimousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon) at 8,950 Marks. There were no fewer than four cabriolet-bodied versions of the longer-wheelbase car offered, being a two-door 2/3-seater (\\"Cabriolet A\\"), a two-door 4-seater with four side- windows (\\"Cabriolet B\\"), a four-door 4-seater (\\"Cabriolet D\\") and a very substantial-looking four-door 6-seater with three rows of seats (\\"Pullman- Cabriolet F\\"). Other soft-topped standard-bodied versions were a Torpedo- bodied 6-seater \\"Tourenwagen\\" and a sporty 2-seater Roadster. There was also a six-seater ‚ÄúPullman-Limousine‚Äù with three rows of seats and six side windows under a conventional steel roof. The rear seat of the Pullman-bodied cars was above the back axle, and an extra luggage locker at the back left the overall length of the Pullman-Limousine at , still using the wheelbase. The highest listed price for a Mercedes-Benz-bodied W142 was 14,500 Marks for a \\"Stromlinien-Limousine\\" featuring a strikingly modern exceptionally streamlined steel body.Oswald, pp. 259‚Äì261  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/III) 1937‚Äì1939  The short-wheelbase version of the car was also the basis for a \\"Wehrmachtsk√ºbelwagen\\" (military vehicle), one of several such vehicles which may have provided inspiration for the subsequent (1941) Jeep. The W142 ‚ÄúK√ºbelwagen‚Äù retained the frontal style of the car on which it was based, but with a horizontal bar ahead of the front grill on which to mount lights. It had four front-hinged doors, a canvas top and wide-tread tyres for rough terrain. In this form the vehicle came with a listed top speed of 118 km/h (73 mph).  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (Works number W142/IV) 1938‚Äì1942  In 1938 the manufacturer increased the cylinder bore to , thereby increasing the engine capacity to 3,405 cc. Nevertheless, the cars retained the \\"Typ 320\\" designation. There was also no change in the power output, still listed at at 4,000 rpm, and there were no claims of improved performance. Instead the compression ratio was lowered in anticipation of future shortages enforcing the use of fuel synthesized from coal which was expected to have a lower octane rating than the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù fuel used at the time. The larger-engined car also came with an overdrive ratio (1 : 0.73) added to the hitherto four-speed gear box which the car had featured since launch.Oswald, pp. 259 & 261 In 1939 the larger engine was also used in the W142/III K√ºbelwagen, this time accompanied by a small increase in maximum output to and an accompanying reassurance that the top speed was undiminished.

It was the fifth flight for SpaceX's uncrewed Dragon cargo spacecraft and the third SpaceX operational mission contracted to NASA under a Commercial Resupply Services contract. This was the first launch of a Dragon capsule on the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle, as previous launches used the smaller v1.0 configuration. It was also the first time the F9 v1.1 has flown without a payload fairing, and the first experimental flight test of an ocean landing of the first stage on a NASA/Dragon mission. The Falcon 9 with CRS-3 on board launched on time at 19:25 UTC on 18 April 2014, and was grappled on 20 April at 11:14 UTC by Expedition 39 commander Koichi Wakata. The spacecraft was berthed to the ISS from 14:06 UTC on that day to 11:55 UTC on 18 May 2014. CRS-3 then successfully de-orbited and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California at 19:05 UTC on 18 May. Launch schedule history Launch of SpaceX CRS-3 from Cape Canaveral on 18 April 2014. The launch was notionally scheduled by NASA, as of November 2012, to be no earlier than 30 September 2013, with berthing to the station occurring three days later on 2 October 2013. By March 2013, the launch was scheduled by NASA for no earlier than 28 November 2013, with berthing to the station occurring three days later on 1 December 2013. By August 2013, the launch date had been moved to no earlier than 15 January 2014, but by October it was moved to 11 February. As of 23 January, the launch was rescheduled again to 1 March 2014, and then rescheduled to 16 March in early February. The several delays‚Äîfrom the nominal December 2013 date that had been in place since early 2013‚Äîhave been mostly due to limited berthing windows in the ISS Visiting Vehicle schedule, and delays to both Orbital's Cygnus and SpaceX's Dragon resulted from the December 2013 cooling issue on the ISS which required several spacewalks to mitigate. On 12 March 2014 the launch was rescheduled to 30 March or 2 April 2014, for a variety of reasons including data buffering issues, working some issues with the range, some operational issues with the new Dragon design, and some contamination of the impact shielding blanket. SpaceX ultimately decided to move forward and use the shielding blanket with the minor contamination problems, believing it would not impact the optical payloads being carried in the Dragon trunk. On 26 March, a further delay was announced related to a fire at one of the radar facilities on the Eastern Range. There is mandatory radar coverage for any launches from Cape Canaveral, and the fire forced a delay until that section of the launch trajectory could be covered, possibly by alternative means that would have telemetry communication capability to the Air Force facility responsible for launch safety. By 4 April, the Eastern Range radars were repaired and back online to support launches, and the CRS-3 launch was slated for no earlier than 14 April with a backup date of 18 April, contingent upon a ULA Atlas V flight scheduled for as early as 10 April. On 11 April, the International Space Station (ISS) suffered a failure of an external computer known as a Multiplexer/Demultiplexer (MDM), which required a spacewalk on 22 April to replace in order to restore vital redundancy to the station. Despite the challenges, the CRS-3 mission ‚Äì which could have been impacted by the MDM failure ‚Äì was still on for 14 April, with ISS berthing scheduled to take place two days later on 16 April. However, during the launch attempt on 14 April, a primary helium supply valve used in the stage separation system failed a pre-launch diagnostic test approximately one hour prior to the scheduled launch, so the SpaceX launch manager scrubbed the mission. In ground tests following the scrub, the redundant backup helium supply valve tested okay so the mission would likely have succeeded; however, it is SpaceX policy to not launch with any known anomalies. The launch was immediately rescheduled for no earlier than the Friday backup date, 18 April. That date was confirmed two days later, following replacement of the defective valve, but also noted that weather constraints may prevent the launch on 18 April from occurring at the instantaneous launch window of 19:25 UTC. If that launch had been scrubbed, the next launch window would have been 19 April at 19:02 UTC. On Friday, 18 April 2014 at 19:25:21 UTC, the vehicle was successfully launched. Primary payload and downmass NASA has contracted for the CRS-3 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. Among other NASA cargo, including repair parts for the ISS, the SpaceX CRS-3 mission carried a large number of experiments to the space station, including: * High Definition Earth Viewing cameras (HDEV) ‚Äì four commercial HD video cameras which will film the Earth from multiple different angles from the vantage. The experiment will help NASA determine what cameras work best in the harsh environment of space. * Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science (OPALS) will demonstrate high-bandwidth space to ground laser communications. * T-Cell Activation in Space (TCAS) ‚Äì studying how \\"deficiencies in the human immune system are affected by a microgravity environment\\" * Vegetable Production System (Veggie) ‚Äì to enable the growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa ) aboard the outpost for scientific research, air purification and ultimately human consumption. Veg-01 hardware validation test includes a plant growth chamber in which the lettuce is grown in bellows-type pillows using LED lighting. * a pair of legs for the Robonaut 2 prototype which has been aboard the space station since its launch on STS-133 in 2011 * Project MERCCURI, a project examining the microbial diversity of the built environment on earth and on the International Space Station. The of downmass cargo from the mission was returned to the Port of Long Beach via marine vessel on 20 May 2014, two days after splashdown. Time-sensitive cargo are unloaded in California and flown to NASA receiving locations. The remainder of the cargo will be unloaded and transferred to NASA at the SpaceX McGregor test facility in Texas, where the Dragon capsule will be fully decommissioned and defueled. Water was found inside the Dragon capsule but preliminary checks indicated that no scientific equipment had been damaged. The source of the water has not been confirmed and will be investigated during the decommissioning of the capsule. Secondary payloads In addition to the primary payload, a Dragon cargo capsule resupply space transport mission to the ISS for NASA, SpaceX deployed five secondary payload CubeSats on the CRS-3 Falcon 9 mission. The CubeSats are part of the ELaNa-V mission partially funded under \\"NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites\\" program. These spacecraft were released from four Poly Picosatellite Orbital Deployers (PPODs) attached to the second stage of the Falcon 9 following the separation of the Dragon from the second stage: * ALL-STAR/THEIA, the Agile Low-cost Laboratory for Space Technology Acceleration and Research is equipped with the Telescopic High-definition Earth Imaging Apparatus (THEIA) camera, it is being used to return color images of the Earth. It is also the first flight a new nanosat satellite bus intended to serve as a platform for future university payloads. ALL-STAR is a three-unit CubeSat built by the University of Colorado at Boulder however its primary mission is to test the underlying spacecraft platform for future missions and to provide experience of designing, building and operating a satellite to the university's students. ALL-STAR is a 3U CubeSat from the Colorado Space Grant Consortium (CoSGC). * the KickSat CubeSat, which was developed by Cornell University and funded through a campaign on the KickStarter website, was intended to deploy a constellation of 104 cracker-sized femtosatellites called \\"Sprites\\", or \\"ChipSats\\". Each Sprite is a square which includes miniaturised solar cells, a gyroscope, magnetometer and a radio system for communication. KickSat failed to deploy the Sprites, and reentered the atmosphere on 14 May. * PhoneSat-2.5, a 1U CubeSat built by NASA Ames Research Center * SporeSat, a 3U CubeSat built by NASA Ames Research Center and Purdue University that will perform experiments on plant cell gravity sensing * TestSat-Lite, a 2U CubeSat from Taylor University * HEART- FLIES, a 1.5U CubeSat from NASA Ames Research Center and Space Florida Consortium Launch vehicle CRS-3 capsule being mated to its Falcon 9 rocket. The CRS-3 mission was the fourth launch of the v1.1 version of the Falcon 9, and the second on which the first-stage booster was used after the mission for a booster descent and landing flight test. Post-mission launch vehicle testing In an arrangement unusual for launch vehicles, the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket conducted a propulsive-return over-water test after the second stage with the Dragon CRS-3 payload separated from the booster. This was the second high-altitude post-mission test of this type, after the first test on Falcon 9 Flight 6 in September 2013. During the 18 April test, the CRS-3 booster became the first successful controlled ocean soft touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital booster. The booster included landing legs for the first time which were extended for the simulated \\"landing\\", and the test utilized more powerful gaseous nitrogen control thrusters than had been used in the previous test to better control aerodynamic-induced rotation. The booster stage successfully approached the water surface with no spin and at zero vertical velocity, as designed. The SpaceX team was able to receive video from cameras placed on the first-stage booster during soft landing test, as well as vehicle telemetry recorded by aircraft, but swells of were reported in the anticipated recovery area. The first stage successfully hovered over the ocean surface, but heavy waves destroyed the stage before boats were able to retrieve it.

Objectives  The project claimed it would design, implementation and validate a shared Future Internet research facility, enabling experimental research into network infrastructure and distributed applications. Programmable test networks can lower the barrier to entry for new ideas, increasing the rate of innovation in network infrastructure. Virtualization of networks is accomplished by the use of virtual routers and the multiplexing of links between them. These programmable testbed networks call for programmable switches and routers that, using virtualization, can process information flows for multiple isolated experimental networks simultaneously. It is envisaged that a researcher will be allocated a slice of resources across the whole network, consisting of a portion of network links, packet processing elements (e.g. routers) and end-hosts; researchers can program their slices to behave as they wish. A slice could extend across the backbone, into access networks, into college campuses, industrial research labs, and include wireless networks, sensor networks, and may (or should) include real users of the applications it supports.

The mission launched on 9 January 2014 at 18:07:05 UTC.  Spacecraft  Orb-1 was the first of eight contracted flights by Orbital Sciences under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services (CRS-1) contract. This was the maiden flight of the Castor 30B second stage. Orbital Sciences continued its naming of Cygnus spacecraft in tribute to former astronauts. This vehicle was named the S.S. C. Gordon Fullerton for C. Gordon Fullerton, the NASA astronaut who died on 21 August 2013. This Cygnus cargo mission launched the Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer to the ISS's Kib≈ç module.  Launch and early operations  Antares and Cygnus, 6 January 2014 The launch of Orb-1 was scheduled for November 2013, but a series of delays pushed the date to 20 December 2013. The Antares launch vehicle rolled out from the Wallops Horizontal Integration Facility (HIF) on the morning of 17 December 2013, and was later erected at Launch Pad 0A. Later that day, due to the need for a series of spacewalks to fix a faulty coolant system on the International Space Station, NASA directed Orbital Sciences to stand down the Antares rocket. Antares was rolled back to the HIF and time-sensitive cargo removed. The launch date was rescheduled for no earlier than 13 January 2014, but was later moved forward to 7 January 2014 after a scheduling conflict at Wallops was resolved. The launch was delayed one day due to cold temperatures at the launch site. NASA Wallops and Orbital Sciences announced the launch attempt on 8 January 2014 was scrubbed due to \\"an unusually high level of space radiation that exceeded by a considerable margin the constraints imposed on the mission to ensure the rocket's electronic systems are not impacted by a harsh radiation environment\\". Orbital later revised this, stating that a more extensive review of the radiation environment found it to be \\"within acceptable limits\\" of the Antares program, and that a launch would be attempted on 9 January 2014. The Orb-1 mission successfully launched on 9 January 2014 at 18:07:05 UTC from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport Launch Pad 0A. Solar array deployment occurred shortly after arriving in orbit. The Cygnus spacecraft arrived at the International Space Station early on 12 January 2014. The launch was expected to be viewable from South Carolina through Massachusetts and as far west as West Virginia. As with its last couple of launches out of Wallops, Orbital Sciences released viewing information for the Eastern United States, including maps indicating launch vehicle maximum elevation above horizon and time of first sighting after launch for the various viewing locations.  Payload  Cygnus was filled with of supplies for the ISS, including science experiments and hardware to expand the research capability of the station, crew provisions and spare parts. This included 12 experiments flying as part of the Student Spaceflight Experiments Program (SSEP), selected from 1,466 entrants and involving 7,200 North American students. Types of cargo include: * Crew supplies: * Hardware: * Science and research: * Computer supplies: * Spacewalk tools: Some of the major experiments focus on: * NASA's Launch Services Program SPHERES-Slosh Experiment for the SPHERES testbed * Vaccines, antibiotic effectiveness, and drug resistance in space * Physics research which may lead to better products on Earth * Fire and liquid behavior in space * Ant behavior in space * Nanoracks CubeSat Deployer.  End of mission  Canadarm2 unberthed the Cygnus spacecraft from the nadir port of the Harmony module on 18 February 2014 at 10:25 UTC. The spacecraft was then maneuvered to a position below the station, where it was released from the Canadarm2 at 11:41 UTC. It then performed a series of separation maneuvers to move it away from the station. The spacecraft reentered the atmosphere and burned up on 19 February 2014 over the southern Pacific Ocean, disposing of approximately of trash.

It is considered to be of architectural importance and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History In 1890 a temporary wooden chapel was built to replace an earlier chapel serving the school, but this was badly damaged by wind in 1893. The Lancaster architects Austin and Paley were commissioned to design a new chapel. This was built in 1895‚Äì97 at a cost of ¬£7,827 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). Architecture The chapel is constructed in yellow sandstone with stone slate roofs. Its architectural style is Perpendicular. The church has a cruciform plan, with a nave and chancel under one roof, north and south transepts, and a north porch. There are north and south aisles, which are narrow and low, forming passages down the side of the church, and creating a tall clerestory. At the crossing is a large octagonal fl√®che. In the chancel are a sedilia, a piscina, and a carved reredos. The windows contain stained glass by Kempe. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Nigel Church, and was previously in St Mary Magdalene's Church, Hucknall, Nottinghamshire, and was installed in the chapel in 1994 by David Wells of Liverpool. It replaced a three-manual organ made in 1897 by Norman Brothers and Beard, which had been rebuilt in about 1954 by Wilkinson and Son of Kendal.

It is a yellow, benzene-soluble solid, which is used industrially for hydroformylation. Preparation [RhH(CO)(PPh3)3] was first prepared by the reduction of [RhCl(CO)(PPh3)2], e.g. with sodium tetrahydroborate, or triethylamine and hydrogen, in ethanol in the presence of excess triphenylphosphine: :[RhCl(CO)(PPh3)2] + NaBH4 \\\\+ PPh3 ‚Üí [RhH(CO)(PPh3)3] + NaCl + BH3 It can also be prepared from an aldehyde, rhodium trichloride and triphenylphosphine in basic alcoholic media.N.

Structure The complex adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with trans CO and hydrido ligands, resulting in pseudo-C3v symmetry. The Rh-P, Rh-C, and Rh-H distances are 2.32, 1.83, and 1.60 √Ö, respectively.I. S. Babra, L. S. Morley, S. C. Nyburg, A. W.

J. la Placa, J. A. Ibers \\"Crystal and Molecular Structure of Tristriphenylphosphine Rhodium Carbonyl Hydride\\" Acta Crystallogr. 1965, p. 511. This complex is one of a small number of stable pentacoordinate rhodium hydrides. Use in hydroformylation This precatalyst was uncovered in attempts to use tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium chloride as a hydroformylation catalyst. It was found that the complex would quickly carbonylate and that the catalytic activity of the resulting material was enhanced by a variety of additives but inhibited by halides. This inhibition did not occur in the presence of base, suggesting that the hydrido-complex represented the catalytic form of the complex.D. Evans, J. A. Osborn, G. Wilkinson \\"Hydroformylation of Alkenes by Use of Rhodium Complex Catalysts\\" J. Chem. Soc. 1968, pp. 3133-3142. Mechanistic considerations [RhH(CO)(PPh3)3] is a catalyst for the selective hydroformylation of 1-olefins to produce aldehydes at low pressures and mild temperatures. The selectivity for n-aldehydes increases in the presence of excess PPh3 and at low CO partial pressures.J. F. Hartwig; Organotransition metal chemistry - from bonding to catalysis. University Science Books. 2009. 753, 757-578. . The first step in the hydroformylation process is the dissociative substitution of an alkene for a PPh3. The migratory insertion of this 18-electron complex can result in either a primary or secondary rhodium alkyl. This step sets the regiochemistry of the product, however it is rapidly reversible. The 16-electron alkyl complex undergoes migratory insertion of a CO to form the coordinately unsaturated acyl. This species once again gives an 18-electron acyl complex.R. V. Kastrup, J. S. Merola, A. A. Oswald; P-31 NMR Studies of Equilibria and Ligand Exchange in Triphenylphosphine Rhodium Complex and Related Chelated Bisphosphine Rhodium Complex Hydroformylation Catalyst Systems. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982.44-16. . The last step involves Œ≤-H elimination via hydrogenolysis which results in the cleavage of the aldehyde product and regeneration of the rhodium catalyst.

Biography Combe was born in Oxford, one of the five daughters of a local ironmonger. In 1840 she married Thomas Combe, then a superintendent at the Oxford University Press but who became a senior partner at the Press and also very rich in the process. This allowed the couple to support several local charities and also to build their art collection. In particular they met and befriended Charles Allston Collins and John Everett Millais. Although the work of the Pre-Raphaelites' was being denounced by art critics, the Combes bought several substantial examples of their work. These included A Converted British Family Sheltering a Christian Missionary from the Persecution of the Druids by William Holman Hunt in 1850, The Return of the Dove to the Ark by Millais in 1851 and Collins' Convent Thoughts the same year. Two years later they acquired Hunt's The Light of the World for 400 guineas. Dante Drewing an Angel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti was purchased in 1855 and The School-Girls Hymn and a version of The Afterglow in Egypt, both by Hunt, in 1860 and 1861. After Thomas Combe died in October 1872, Martha bequeathed most of the paintings to Oxford University who placed them with the Ashmolean Museum.

Mission highlights  * Flight Day 1 (launch): after a 10-minute flight sequence, Antares launched Cygnus into orbit on the same plane as the International Space Station, but significantly below it. Cygnus then deployed its solar arrays after separation from Antares. After a series of checks, ground controllers commanded Cygnus to begin increasing its altitude. * Flight Days 2 and 3: Cygnus continued to increase its altitude to match that of the space station. * Flight Day 4: NASA made a go/no-go decision for Cygnus to berth with the station whereupon Cygnus first autonomously approached within below the space station, where it stopped and held position. Astronauts aboard the station then commanded Cygnus to a \\"free drift\\" mode, where they captured it with the station's robotic arm attached to the station's nadir node. * Flight Day 5 to Day 36: ISS Astronauts opened Cygnus' hatch, unloaded the payload and filled it with cargo for disposal. * Flight Day 36 through Day 41 Cygnus was detached from the station and maneuvered a safe distance away. Engineering tests were conducted for 2 days before a series of engine burns were conducted to slow the spacecraft for reentry over the South Pacific Ocean, where it and the cargo inside were destroyed.

He spent two years as a marine engineer, but an accident led him to enlist in the Royal Navy in 1917. He spent four years as a sailor. Playing career Club In 1921, Howieson purchased his release from the Navy and joined Rutherglen Glencairn. Later that year, he moved to Airdrieonians (they won the Scottish Cup during his time there and he played a part in the run, but was not involved in the final itself). In 1924, he transferred to St Johnstone. During the season, Howieson played most of St Johnstone's league games, but went on loan to St Mirren for all that team's cup games as well as a few league games. At the end of the season, he moved to Dundee United. In October 1925, Dundee United sold Howieson's contract to St Mirren for ¬£1,000. He won the 1926 Scottish Cup with St Mirren, scoring the winning goal.St Mirren's Victory  Celtic Lose Scottish Cup at Hampden, The Glasgow Herald, 12 April 1926 In March 1927, St Mirren sent him south to Hull City for ¬£3200.

That season saw the outbreak of the \\"Soccer War\\" between the ASL and the United States Football Association over control of the sport. As part of that dispute, the USFA and FIFA declared the ASL and outlaw league and created a competing league, the Eastern Professional Soccer League. Although the Whalers remained in the ASL for most of the season, it moved to the EPSL in the spring of 1929. Howieson played thirty-five games, scoring nine goals in the ASL, then another eight games, scoring eight goals, in the EPSL. With four games left in the season, the Whalers sent Howieson to the New York Giants for four games. At the end of the season, Howieson returned to Hull City for the 1929‚Äì30 season.

The term POCOP is used both for the ligand, with formula C6H4(OPPh2)2, and its complexes, with formula C6H3(OPPh2)2]‚àí (Ph = C6H5) Synthesis and structure Interest in POCOP arises from its easy synthesis, which accommodates many substituents on phosphorus and results in higher yields than other PCP analogues.

Structure of a Ni(POCOP)X complex. Representative complexes are of the type Ni(POCOP)X (X = halide, alkyl, thiolate). The halides arise by direct reaction of the ligand and a nickel halide and offer a relatively cheap, nontoxic and readily available option of the ligand for various applications. There can also be variable conformations of POCOP pertaining to the various R groups branching off of the donor atoms. Thermal ellipsoid plot of Ni(POCOP)Cl compound In most cases the MPOCOP center features a planar MC3O2P2 core. The rigid conformation and square planar geometry of the POCOP ligand allow for systematic changes over the steric and electronic environment at the metal center. The geometry of metal compounds formed with POCOP ligands can be seen through the P-Ni-P (164.01 √Ö ) and C-Ni- Cl (178.31√Ö) bond angles found for (POCOP)NiCl. The bond angles of this compound are representative of angles found for several other pocop metal compounds. Because of relatively small P-Ni-P bond angle the otherwise Ni complexes exhibit a slight tetrahedral distortion. Catalytic reaction Pincer ligands participate in a variety of organic transformation, such as the hydrosilylation, and ethylene oligomerizations, and homocoupling of benzyl halides. Ni PCP pincer complexes promote sulfur-carbon forming reactions.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Westmeath in the UK Parliament in 1830, holding the seat until 1841, after which it passed to his brother. In that same year he visited Australia and on 14 June 1842 was granted title to a large estate near Adelaide, which he leased out as smaller farms. Many of the farms were leased to tenants from his own Irish estate, from where 120 people emigrated to Australia. Originally named Montagu's Farm, the area is now known as Gepp's Cross. He was appointed High Sheriff of Westmeath for 1844. He died in 1852 on a sea voyage from Melbourne to Sydney, when the vessel in which he was sailing disappeared without trace. He had never married and his Irish and Australian estates were inherited by his younger brother Benjamin.

The floods originated as a stationary front on May 24 that produced rainfall across much of the central Caribbean Sea for two weeks. Rainfall totals in Jamaica reached at Norman Manley International Airport. The flooding left heavy agriculture damage totaling $22.5 million, and 40,000 residents per day received meals after the event. Roads and bridges were damaged across the country, and one damaged bridge resulted in eight deaths after a bus crashed. The floods left 2,000 Jamaicans homeless. Elsewhere, the floods were the worst in Haiti in decades. There, a swollen river destroyed several homes in Les Cayes, and there were 21 deaths nationwide. In neighboring Dominican Republic, flooding isolated several towns and caused mudslides that killed 12 people. In Cuba, flooding was worst in the easternmost four provinces, and there were five deaths. The overall system spawned a subtropical cyclone on June 5 that later became Tropical Storm Andrew. Meteorological history Beginning on May 24, a stationary front persisted across the central Caribbean Sea. It dropped torrential rainfall across Jamaica, totaling in Saint Andrew Parish, and at Norman Manley International Airport. There were reports as high as in the southern portion of the country. The high rainfall caused rivers to flow faster than usual, and the Yallahs River reported a peak discharge of 453 m¬≥/s. Flooding also affected Hispaniola and eastern Cuba. In Haiti, the floods were reported as the worst in decades. The system gradually moved to the north through the Greater Antilles, developing into a subtropical cyclone on June 5\\\\. It eventually became Tropical Storm Andrew before dissipating on June 8. Impact The high rainfall caused island-wide flooding in Jamaica, as well as widespread landslides. Along the coast, freshwater flooding decreased salt- levels, lowered ocean temperatures, and caused a significant increase of phytoplankton. By two weeks after the floods subsided, phytoplankton levels returned to normal. Significant agricultural damage occurred due to the flooding. Over of crop fields were damaged, and many livestock and fish died. Damage was heaviest in Clarendon Parish, and the nationwide crop damage was estimated at $22.5 million. Water systems were damaged in eight of the fourteen Parishes of Jamaica, leaving 100,000 people without water. More than 300 roads were damaged or blocked, and 15 bridges were damaged. Four people were killed after being buried by a landslide. A collapsed bridge in May Pen, located southwest of Kingston, was washed out by the Rio Minho, killing eight people in a bus. Nationwide, 14 hospitals and 16 other health facilities were severely damaged, and many government offices had roof damage. Damage to utilities was estimated at $1.65 million. The floods left 2,000 people homeless, many of whom stayed in shelters, and there were 50 deaths. The flooding was described as similar to the deadly floods in June 1979. Flooding was also reported in Hispaniola and eastern Cuba. In Cuba, a state of alert was declared for Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Granma, and Holguin provinces, and 7,500 people were evacuated. Heavy rainfall caused landslides and isolated several towns after roads and rails were blocked. Some areas lost power or telephone services. Five people were killed in Cuba, four of whom from drowning and one from electrocution. In nearby Haiti, flooding was worst in Les Cayes, where the Ravine River destroyed many homes and left 1,300 homeless. Throughout the country, flooding severely damaged crops and wrecked bridges and roads. There were 21 deaths in the Les Cayes area. In the Dominican Republic, there were 12 deaths around Santo Domingo after mudslides buried people. Four towns were isolated after rivers exceeded their banks, forcing hundreds of people to evacuate. Overall, the system caused 94 deaths and $25 million in damage. Aftermath After the floods subsided, the government of Jamaica appealed to the international community for assistance. Local workers cleared roads, and about 1,100 people assisted in various relief efforts. The Jamaican Red Cross provided about 40,000 meals each day to residents who lost food during the floods. Repairing damaged roads and bridges cost about $4.3 million. For at least one day, all schools and most businesses on the island were closed. In the weeks following the floods, the Pan American Health Organization provided $10,000 worth of water supply units and a group of six workers, and offices within the United Nations provided $55,000 worth of contributions. The government of Barbados provided five units to assist in vector control, and the United States donated $25,000 in aid. The European Economic Community donated about $376,300 in assistance. The government of Canada provided $142,490 worth of aid, and the government of West Germany donated $21,740. The British Red Cross and the United Kingdom government collectively donated $302,850 to the country, mostly for 3 helicopters to transport relief and medical teams. The California Air National Guard flew three trips of supplies, including 2,000 cots, to Jamaica.

The school is part of Westerly Public Schools.  History  Various incarnations of a high school have been serving students in Westerly since shortly after the American Civil War. Three buildings in the first century (1870‚Äì1960) The first Westerly High School was built at 32 Elm Street in 1870. It cost $10,000 to build. After about 30 years, the building was too small to support the town's population. This led to the construction of a new building on Broad and Granite Street, which was completed in 1903. The high school's population began to rise in the late 1920s. This led to the construction of Babcock Junior High School on Highland Avenue, which reduced the high school population to include only students in grades 10‚Äì12. Despite this, the school was still not big enough to provide a secondary education to the students of Westerly. The Broad Street building was abandoned and replaced with a new building, completed in 1937, on Ward Avenue, one block east of Babcock Junior High School. This building became known as Ward Senior High School, named after Rhode Island Governor Samuel Ward. Transformation and modernization (1960s‚Äì1990s) Throughout the 1960s, the Westerly Public Schools underwent transformations. A fifth elementary school (Dunn's Corners) was added. In addition, Babcock Junior High and Westerly High were renovated. The high school got a new library, new science rooms, new music rooms, and new general classrooms. In the mid‚Äì1970s, ninth grade returned to the high school. High enrollment and the extra grade led to the creation of a new gymnasium (Federico Gymnasium) and new classrooms. The new wing ‚Äì built on a practice field near Park Avenue ‚Äì comprised home economics classrooms, technology classrooms, art classrooms, and general classrooms. The high school became overcrowded in the 1980s. In 1981, three elementary schools closed: Bradford, High Street, and State Street. This led to an extremely crowded high school that, at some times, housed students in grades 7‚Äì12. By 1987, State Street Elementary had reopened, which eliminated the seventh grade from the high school. By 1990, the district was more stable, with Bradford Elementary reopened. (High Street Elementary School never reopened.) The elementary schools housed students up to fourth grade, Babcock became a middle school housing grades 5‚Äì7, and the high school housed 8‚Äì12. By 1989, the school made efforts to become more accessible to the handicapped. An elevator was added, the handicap ramp was redesigned, and a dumb waiter was installed in the auditorium. To accommodate the growing population, the library and the cafeteria were also enlarged. These renovations did not impress officials from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), who criticized Westerly High School‚Äôs facilities. Discussion was made about building a new school in Dunn‚Äôs Corners, but this idea was widely panned. Instead, voters approved expansion to the middle and high schools. The high school and other schools underwent renovation and modification in the mid-1990s. Work at the high school included four new classrooms, moving the office to a room on the first floor adjacent to the handicap ramp, replacing that office with a new expanded library, and remaking the old library into the Guidance Department and Social Services. Also, a fifth elementary school, Springbrook, was opened in the fall of 1996. By the fall of 1995, grades K‚Äì5 were at the elementary schools, grades 6‚Äì8 at the middle school, and grades 9‚Äì12 at the high school. However, these renovations were projected to accommodate the town‚Äôs growth only until 2005. The high school also suffered from \\"turmoil\\" and administrative instability in the later part of this era. After being shepherded by only two principals from 1966 to 1989, eight different principals served from 1989 to 1997 with six principals in the latter five years. Expansion in the new century (2000‚Äìpresent) In 2001, members from the Gilbane Construction Company argued that Westerly should build or expand its schools. The superintendent was against expanding the current buildings, so attention directed to the construction of new buildings. The most profitable property was known as the Panciera Property, located on Route 1. Ideas included making that a second middle school or an intermediate school. Another idea included building a new high school on Park Avenue, making the high school the middle school, and making Babcock the administration building, or possibly selling it. The idea that won over voters was to build a new middle school on the Panciera property, and combining Babcock Middle and the high school into a high school campus. The property was bought in 2002, and the new Westerly Middle School broke ground in April 2004. After the completion of the middle school, the attention turned to the high school buildings. The high school‚Äôs corridors were renovated and select classrooms received new ceiling tiles. A bridge was installed at Babcock, allowing students to enter from the back, rather than the front. Throughout the 2005‚Äì06 school year, Park and Ward Avenues were closed off and made into a quadrangle to ease access between buildings for the high school students. Three years later, the taxpayers of Westerly decided that further renovation at Westerly High School was necessary. The work began in 2010. In the summer of 2010, most windows were replaced and the 1977 wing was gutted to allow construction of a new science and technology wing. In order to allow for construction, the woodshop was moved to the Babcock Hall Cafeteria. Three classrooms were renovated into computer labs that allowed the remainder of technology teachers to conduct class there until construction was finished. Three Babcock Hall classrooms that were once science labs were converted into two large art classrooms, as the art teachers were displaced from their classrooms on the second floor of the 1977 wing. The child development classroom was also permanently moved to Babcock. Two additional Babcock Hall classrooms (215 and 216) were renovated, along with ten classrooms in the Ward Building. New classrooms had new floor tiles and ceiling tiles with fans, in addition to interactive white board technology. In February 2011, the new science and technology wing opened. The first floor consists of two physics labs with a prep room separating them, two computer labs, and two woodshops, in addition to pictures of notable physicists and artists. The floor of the entire wing is designed to resemble a DNA molecule. The second floor has three biology labs, three chemistry labs, a teacher office along with several science prep rooms and a \\"flex\\" science room. Meanwhile, the old science classrooms were converted into general classrooms. This work was completed by April 2011. Heavy duty work was done on most of the remainder of the buildings until December 2011. After all the classrooms were touched up, the library was renovated with a new carpet. The desktop computers were replaced with laptops. In the fall of 2012, a classroom within the library was constructed, allowing teachers to conduct classes while using the library‚Äôs resources. Since 2009, the high school has had select programs at Tower Street School. Tower Street closed as an elementary school that year and is now a community center.

Under his leadership, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) revealed that up to two-thirds of certain Global Fund grants may have been lost to corruption through forged documents, improper bookkeeping, the diversion of donated prescription drugs to the black market, and other irregularities. Two OIG reports (one covering grants to a sub-recipient in Bangladesh and another to a principal recipient in Djibouti) identified losses of $10M, which was more than 50 percent of the total funds disbursed to the recipient governments and non-governmental organisations. In a controversial decision, the Global Fund's Board terminated Parsons in November 2012. A news release issued by the Global Fund on the removal of Parsons as Inspector General stated that the Board \\"made its decision based on factors including: a performance review; an independent external peer review of the audit function; and a report to the Board by its Audit and Ethics Committee.\\" However, the Board has not substantiated the performance allegations or released Parsons' performance reviews. The Aids Healthcare Foundation (AHF) called Parsons' dismissal a \\"hatchet job.\\" Biography Parsons, a British citizen, worked for the United Kingdom National Audit Office from 1973 to 1996, and was appointed Director there in 1989. From 1989 to 1990, he was seconded to the US Government Accountability Office, where he conducted performance audits in the education and defence sectors. Parsons was the director of UNICEF's Office of Internal Audit in New York from 1996 to 2000 and director of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Internal Oversight Service immediately prior to joining the Global Fund. He has also served on the Global Advisory Group to the World Health Organization. Work at the Global Fund Parsons began working at the Global Fund in 2008 and worked as its second inspector general. In this position, he led the OIG, which provides the Global Fund \\"with independent and objective assurance over the design and effectiveness of controls in place to manage the key risks impacting the Global Fund's programs and operations.\\" The OIG's mandate covers audits and investigations of fraud allegations, including those from whistleblowers. Under Parsons, from 2008 to 2009 the number of investigations from whistleblower complaints tripled (to 66 investigations). A report by a leader in the ethics field praised Parsons and his staff as \\"gracious and patient\\" and stated that \\"his leadership vision and commitment to ethical conduct is tangible in all that he does.\\" Parsons recruited Robert Appleton, a former US federal prosecutor and chairman of the United Nations Procurement Task Force, to assist him at the Global Fund. Investigations that Appleton led found that up to two-thirds of certain Global Fund grants were lost to graft. According to an Associated Press story, the OIG identified more than $34 million in losses in Global Fund grants in various countries in Africa. The OIG could not provide an overall accounting of how much was lost at the Global Fund because it \\"examined only a tiny fraction of the $10 billion that the fund has spent since its creation in 2002.\\" Parsons praised the OIG findings as evidence of the Global Fund's dedication to uncovering corruption and said that the organisation's commitment to investigating wrongdoing \\"should be viewed as a comparative advantage to anyone who's thinking about putting funds in here.\\" He said that at the Fund, \\"if there is any question of misappropriation, action is taken, things happen, people are asked to repay the money, people get taken through the courts and end up in prison if they misappropriated our funds.\\" Former George W. Bush speech writer Michael Gerson weighed in on the Associated Press story saying that: ‚ÄúThis particular narrative ‚Äì the story of useless, wasted aid ‚Äì is durable. It is also misleading and might be deadly. The Global Fund controversy illustrates the point. The two-thirds figure applies to one element of one country's grant ‚Äì the single most extreme example in the world. Investigations are ongoing, but the $34 million in fraud that has been exposed represents about three-tenths of 1 percent of the money the fund has distributed. The targeting of these particular cases was not random; they were the most obviously problematic, not the most typical....These cases of corruption were not exposed by an enterprising journalist. They were revealed by the fund itself. The inspector general's office reviewed 59,000 documents in the case of Mali alone, then provided the findings to prosecutors in that country. Fifteen officials in Mali have been arrested and imprisoned. The outrage at corruption in foreign aid is justified. But this is what accountability and transparency in foreign aid look like. The true scandal is decades of assistance in which such corruption was assumed instead of investigated and exposed... It was the United States ‚Äì the fund's largest supporter ‚Äì that pushed in 2005 for the appointment of a strong inspector general to fight fraud. He is now doing his job.‚Äù In response to the OIG's findings, the Global Fund took several corrective actions, including establishing a High-Level Panel to investigate the Fund's ability to prevent and detect fraud. The panel's report found the OIG to be \\"the only risk mitigation strategy within the Global Fund that has worked as designed.\\" In addition, the Panel strongly recommended that approximately $34 million in lost grant money be returned and millions were indeed recovered. Controversial Termination Initially, the Global Fund announced that it would increase resources for the OIG in the wake of these findings, but its Board subsequently considered scaling back investigations and releasing less information about them publicly and to donors. Parsons publicly opposed these latter changes: he believed that this ‚Äúcould be interpreted negatively and as a purposeful effort to suppress material information.‚Äù On 15 November 2012 the Global Fund's Board ‚Äì which includes members representing countries that receive grants from the Fund ‚Äì announced it had hired a new executive director and fired Parsons. Prior to Parsons' termination, the OIG had a caseload of 142 active investigations, an increase of 70 percent from two years prior. The Board said it made its decision based on factors including: a performance review; an independent external peer review of the audit function; and a report to the Board by its Audit and Ethics Committee. The Fund announced that it would appoint an interim inspector general for six months, while it looked for a permanent replacement. The Board's statement also mentioned the Global Fund's support for an independent and strong Office of the Inspector General. The AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) was extremely critical of the decision to fire Parsons. According to AHF President Michael Weinstein, \\"it appears that John Parsons has been fired merely for doing his job too well. This is a very dark day for the Global Fund and accountability in development funding in general.\\" The Health Care Renewal blog also condemned the decision, urging the Global Fund to make assurances that they \\"are not out to get whistleblowers, including their own internal watchdogs.\\" However, on the evening prior to his termination, Parsons was called to a session of the Board to discuss and defend his future position as Inspector General. In a commentary later published in The Global Fund Observer Newsletter, Bernard Rivers, a Senior Fellow within Aidspan, the independent observer of The Global Fund, listed the reasons behind the Board's decision to terminate, further observing that: \\"When he started to defend his record to the Board at the evening session on 14 November, he still had a few allies on the board. By the time he had finished speaking, he had none, and no Board members voted against the termination.\\" According to the Associated Press, \\"the board chairman, Simon Bland, and the head of its audit committee, Graham Joscelyne, each said they were unconcerned whether U.S. lawmakers might perceive the firing as an infringement on the office. Joscelyne would not elaborate on what Parsons did wrong but cited several reviews of him that were not disclosed.\\" But according to AHF's General Counsel,\\"the only way Mr. Parsons' efforts could be considered unsatisfactory is if the Board felt he had not found enough waste, fraud, and abuse in Global Fund programs. It is more likely the opposite is true; the Fund was uncomfortable having its shortcomings so exposed.\\" Following Parson's dismissal, the Board said that it recognised the need to maintain continuity in the work of the audits and investigations currently underway, while it searched for a new Inspector General. During the two months before his firing, Parsons had asserted in emails to other fund officials that Bland and Joscelyne, who directly oversaw Parsons' office, were trying to weaken his office and prevent the release of information that could cause more bad publicity. ‚Äù Joscelyne emailed Parsons that the committee would more directly manage the office's work, reports and personnel, and that it would reserve the right to assign specific tasks to staff that could replace their planned assignments, according to swissinfo.ch. In response, the emails showed, Parson asserted in emails that Joscelyne and the audit committee backed by Bland were trying to weaken the office by curtailing its field work, ordering changes in personnel and pressuring to reduce the scope and depth of audits and investigations and what is disclosed from them in public reports. At the November 2012 board meeting, Parsons clashed with Bland and Joscelyne at a closed-door session. Hours later, Parsons emailed Bland and the audit and ethics committee to say it was clear ‚Äúthat you want me out of the Global Fund, and that your true intention is to weaken the function _ simply because you don‚Äôt like what we find and report upon.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no credible basis for criticism of me or my office worthy of this hostility and degree of attack that I have been subject to,‚Äù Parsons wrote in an email. ‚ÄúThe world will see this for what it truly is _ an intentional effort by you and Graham to weaken the function, diminish the office and penalize me for simply doing my job ...\\", he wrote. Parsons‚Äô firing was announced later that day. According to the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblower protection organisation, \\"when an organization confronts operational shortcomings like this, management and the board have two choices. They can either address the problems and move on, or they can attack the sources of the information ‚Äì the IG, whistleblowers, auditors ‚Äì and seek to discredit them. The Global Fund chose the latter course... At GAP, where we have dealt with thousands of whistleblowers over the years, we recognize this as the classic form of retaliation.\\"  ILO Administrative tribunal outcome  On 3 February 2016 the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization (ILOAT), during its 121st session concluded, in case 3613, in favour of Mr Parsons' appeal to the Tribunal.

Highway 115 in Mount Mourne. The Battle of Torrence's Tavern (also referred to as the Skirmish at Torrence's Tavern or the Battle at Tarrant's Tavern) was a minor engagement of the American Revolutionary War that took place in what was the western portion of Rowan County, North Carolina, approximately east of the Catawba River near modern-day Mooresville in Iredell County. Torrence's Tavern was a part of the larger Southern campaign of the American Revolution, which, by 1780‚Äì1781 involved a series of clashes between the British Army and Loyalist militia and the Continental Army and Patriot militia in the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina. The engagement took place on either February 1 or February 2, 1781 immediately following the Battle of Cowan's Ford, and resulted in a victory for British cavalry units under the command of Colonel Banastre Tarleton. The British victory served to demoralize Patriot supporters in western North Carolina, and forced General Nathanael Greene, commander of the Continental Army in the southern theater, to withdraw his forces further east. This withdrawal allowed Greene to unite his army with several detached Patriot forces in the Piedmont prior to the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. After the conclusion of the war, the site of Torrence's Tavern was commemorated by two state and local historical markers. Prelude Throughout the winter of 1780‚Äì1781, the British Army in the Carolinas, under the command of General Charles Cornwallis, pursued the southern Continental Army, commanded by Nathanael Greene, from central South Carolina to North Carolina. At the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781, the Continental Army scored a victory against a force, detached from the main British Army, commanded by Tarleton. After the defeat, Cornwallis set out to pursue Greene into nearby North Carolina. The victor of Cowpens, Daniel Morgan, had requested that Greene relieve him of his command of the Patriot militia due to a flare-up of sciatica, but Greene refused. Morgan then set about establishing defenses on the Catawba River, which Cornwallis' army would be forced to cross in order to drive into central and eastern North Carolina. Defensive positions were established at every ford on the river in that state in expectation of the British assault. By January 30, Morgan had received word that the British were indeed preparing to cross the river. On January 31, 1781, Greene and Morgan left the Catawba River defenses in the hands of militia General William Lee Davidson, and rode towards Salisbury to establish a rallying point. The Continental force crossed the Catawba River ahead of Cornwallis' army, and followed Davidson and Morgan to the rallying point. At Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, a force of Patriot militia commanded directly by Davidson held back the British Army for a period of time, and slowed their crossing of the Catawba River. Davidson's militia inflicted numerous casualties before withdrawing towards the rally point. Davidson was killed in the battle at the ford, leaving the surviving militia temporarily without effective strategic command. Battle and aftermath Date of the engagement Confusion exists over the exact date of the Battle of Torrence's Tavern; official North Carolina historical sources often cite February 2 as the date, but Tarleton's memoirs indicate that the engagement occurred at two o'clock in the afternoon of February 1, after the early-morning confrontation at Cowan's Ford. Tarleton's pursuit of the militia Cornwallis, whose army took a longer amount of time to cross the Catawba, wanted to prevent Greene's forces from withdrawing quickly and being able to regroup, and so he ordered Colonel Tarleton, the commander of the British Legion, to pursue the militia formerly commanded by Davidson. After the engagement at Cowan's Ford, citizens between the Catawba and Yadkin rivers who were sympathetic to the Patriots became panicked, and many fled their homes with whatever valuables they could pack in a short period of time. Tarleton's British Legion was a force that contained infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, but Tarleton was forced to take only his mounted soldiers with him due to heavy rains in the area. Upon nearing the site of what Tarleton labeled \\"Tarrant's Tavern\\", the British commander gained information that led him to believe the militia ahead were unprepared for any engagement, and were waiting on reinforcements from Mecklenburg and Rowan county militias. At the time of the battle, Torrence's Tavern sat on a roadway that ran from Beatty's and Cowan's fords on the Catawba directly to Salisbury. Additionally, the same rain that forced Tarleton to shed his foot-soldiers had rendered much of the militia's gunpowder supply useless. Refugees with Patriot sympathies who had fled in advance of Cornwallis' army had also used Torrence's Tavern as a rendezvous point, and a large number of both militiamen and refugees consumed alcohol from the tavern's stores. Assault of the British Legion Despite lacking support from Cornwallis' main army, Tarleton's cavalry struck immediately upon arriving at the scene, charging into the militia's makeshift camp. At the first sign of the British approach, the Patriots attempted to organize a defense under the ad-hoc command of Captain Nathaniel M. Martin, who tried to rally the militia to a line behind a nearby rail fence. There is also evidence that Col. Thomas Farmer and some 300 militia were stationed at the tavern as a secondary defensive line. Tarleton claimed to have led the charge by reminding his cavalrymen to \\"remember the Cowpens\\". The British won in a quick and convincing fashion, dispersing the outnumbered militia units before they managed to complete their rally. Martin was captured in the first few moments of the battle, thereafter leaving the Patriots without any effective tactical command. With Patriot forces under the effects of such confusion, Tarleton divided his dragoons into smaller parties, ordering them to chase and further disburse the militia from the area. While the battle was a minor engagement, the defense provided some additional time for Greene's main army of regulars to cross the Yadkin River without harassment near Salisbury, which allowed that force to regroup and resupply. At the time of the skirmish, Greene was at a farm owned by David Carr (sometimes attributed as \\"Cain\\"), approximately from the tavern. Carr's farm had been set as a secondary rendezvous point for the Patriot militia, but none of the expected units rallied to that location following the Torrence's Tavern engagement. Upon reaching Salisbury after the loss, and finding nearly 1,700 stands of muskets rusted and in useless condition, Greene reportedly exclaimed: \\"These are the happy effects of defending the Country with Militia from which the good Lord deliver us!\\" The tavern that stood at the location of the battle was burned to the ground the day after the engagement by the main British army, as it had been operated by the Ann (Bonar) Torrence, widow of Patriot Adam Torrence--a militiaman killed at the Battle of Ramsour's Mill. Legacy The battle's impact on the American Revolutionary War in the southern theater was minor, but the failure of Patriot militia to significantly stall Cornwallis at Cowan's Ford and Torrence's Tavern caused Greene to hasten his retreat towards his ultimate goal, Guilford Courthouse, where he determined to rendezvous with a detached force under the command of Isaac Huger. The total impact of Torrence's Tavern alone, however, has been rated as especially minor, since the Continental Army force commanded by Greene managed to escape Cornwallis' advance regardless of the short engagement's outcome, and given the more substantial delay to the British caused by the defense at Cowan's Ford the previous day. John Buchanan, an American historian and archivist, postulated that at most, Torrence's Tavern discouraged further militia turnout among North Carolinians of fighting age, noting, however, that turnout had previously been very low in that state. Buchanan went so far as to state that \\"had Tarleton not lived to write his history of the campaign Torrence's Tavern probably would have merited at most a footnote.\\" Cornwallis, however, wrote to George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville about the engagements of February 1‚Äì2, 1781, and stated that \\"this stroke, with our passage of the ford, so effectively dispirited the militia, that we met with no further opposition on our march to the Yadkin.\\" A Daughters of the American Revolution stone marker was placed near the battle site in 1914, marking the site of the tavern and commemorating the members of nearby Centre Presbyterian Church who had fought in the war. In 1939, the State of North Carolina placed a Historical marker on the south-bound shoulder of N.C. Highway 115 in Mount Mourne marking the approximate location of the battle.

Biography  Knoblauch has a degree in Sociology from the University of Konstanz where he also did his PhD. He did research and taught among others at the University of California at Berkeley, King‚Äôs College London, the Universities of Konstanz, Zurich, Bern and Vienna. From 1996 he was a Heisenberg scholar of the German Research Association (DFG). In 2000 he became Professor in Religious Studies at the Theological Faculty of the University of Zurich. Since 2002 he is Professor of General Sociology/Theories of Modern Societies at the Technical University of Berlin.  Works  His texts are published in 10 languages and cover the sociology of knowledge, communication, contemporary religion, death and dying and video analysis. He is member of the Council of the DGS (German Society for Sociology) and had many positions within the ESA, e.g. Chair of the RN Sociology of Culture.  Research methodology and theoretical orientation  In his research Knoblauch focusses on various fields within theoretical and empirical sociology. He developed his own approach to the investigation of social interaction called focused ethnography. In contrast to ‚Äúclassic‚Äù ethnography this does not include prolonged stays in foreign cultures, but relies on video recordings of specialized fields within the researchers own society. The combination between video analysis and focused ethnography was elaborated as ‚Äúvideography‚Äù.Knoblauch, Hubert (2006) Videography. Focused Ethnography and Video Analysis, in Knoblauch, Hubert; Schnettler, Bernt; Raab, J√ºrgen and Hans-Georg Soeffner (eds.): Video Analysis: Methodology and Methods. Frankfurt am Main, Peter Lang, pp.69-83. Another major field of his work is the sociology of religion, where he advocates for a broad understanding of the role of religion in modern society. Building on Luckmann‚Äôs ‚Äúinvisible religion‚Äù, he was one of the first to analyse the new forms of spirituality and developed the idea of a mediatized, event- and experience based ‚Äúpopular religion‚Äù.Knoblauch, Hubert (2012): Popular Religion, in Juergensmeyer, Mark an Wade Clark Roof (eds.): Encyclopedia of Global Religion. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications,DOI: 10.4135/9781412997898.n572 Next to his contribion in re-establishing the sociology of knowledge in German speaking sociology, communication was a crucial reference point for his work. While he analysed communication processes already in his dissertation on dowsing and divination, in his habilitation thesis ‚ÄúKommunikationskultur: Die kommunikative Konstrutkion kultureller Kontexte‚Äù (translation: Communication Culture: The Communicative Construction of Cultural Contexts) he elaborated a theoretical framework which came to be known as ‚ÄúCommunicative Constructivism‚Äù. Based on ‚ÄúThe Social Construction of Reality‚Äù by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, this approach includes bodily performances and material ‚Äúobjectivations‚Äù as ‚Äúthe missing analytical link which allows one to turn social into communicative action‚Äù. Without being reduced to speech acts, ‚Äúcommunicative action\\" becomes ‚Äúthe basic process in the social construction of reality‚Äù.ibidem: 297  Publications (selection)  *H. Knoblauch, R.

As of 2011, about 25% of the nation's blood supply came from voluntary donation, 20‚Äì25% from paid donors, and 50‚Äì55% from one-time donation for a specific patient. Background Blood transfusion service became available in Bangladesh at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital in 1950. Professional blood donors were the mainstay of blood donation in Bangladesh, with 47% of donated blood coming from professional donors as late as the year 2000. The potential for contamination in the supply, and the need for volunteer donors was well recognised. An estimate from 2011 is that of the 500,000 units of blood required annually, only 25% come from voluntary donation, 20‚Äì25% from paid donors, and 50‚Äì55% from one-time donation for a specific patient. Medicine Club Medicine Club is a Non-profit Humanitarian Organization in Bangladesh volunteered by Medical & Dental students.http://medicineclub-bd.org/about-us/ The organization was founded on January 31, 1981 at Mymensingh Medical College with the intention of helping the helpless and serving humanity. Now it has 21 Units in different Medical & dental colleges. It has since broadened its scope to include voluntary blood donating, prevent Thalassaemia http://medicineclub-bd.org/thalassaemia/ throughout Bangladesh & rise awareness about this. It contributes a large amount of donated blood throughout Bangladesh.http://medicineclub- bd.org/blood-division/ It also helps poor patients by donating money and drugs.http://medicineclub-bd.org/drug-division/ This organization also distributes vaccineshttp://medicineclub-bd.org/vaccination-division/ & warm clothshttp://medicineclub-bd.org/warm-clothes-distribution/ and arranges \\"Health Check Up Campaigns\\".http://medicineclub-bd.org/health-check-up/ SANDHANI The first voluntary blood donation program in Bangladesh was begun in 1977 at Dhaka Medical College, and was organized by SANDHANI. SANDHANI has now 25 units in different medical and dental colleges. SANDHANI is a voluntary institution run by the medical and dental students of BANGLADESH. It is mainly working on motivation on voluntary blood donation and posthumous eye donation in Bangladesh. SANDHANI is also working for the helpless patient in the community by serving them with drug from the drug bank, donating blood to the thalassaemia patient, giving relief to the flooded and disaster affected people etc. Red Crescent Society The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement began a blood program in Bangladesh in 1981. Today they operate several centres, using both whole blood and fractionated blood components. Badhan A 1997 survey of students at the University of Dhaka had found a generally favourable attitude towards voluntary blood donation, and an overwhelmingly unfavourable attitude to paid blood donation, and recommended that a campaign should be started immediately to increase awareness and participation in voluntary blood donation among the student population. Badhan is a non-political voluntary blood donors' organisation in Bangladesh that was established in 1997. Badhan's first activity was a free blood-group testing program that took place on 24 October 1997 at Shahidullah Hall of the University of Dhaka. Shahidullah Hall is very close to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital, and before that time people needing blood for patients would gather regularly in or near the hall gate, seeking help. Mohammad Shahidul Islam Ripon was the principal originator of the program, along with other students. The blood provided is fresh rather than stored, using a database of people whose blood type has been previously established. The graduate- and postgraduate-level students of Bangladeshi universities and postgraduate colleges are the main participants of the organisation. The organisation is active in 14 universities and 29 university colleges. Other activities include raising awareness about donating fresh blood, donating blood voluntarily for patients and helping poor people in time of natural disasters. Financing comes primarily from individual members and ex-members, as well as from the universities and colleges administration, from donations. The California non-profit organisation SpaandanB has been a significant contributor from outside Bangladesh. Badhan wants to make blood donation as a social movement. Its ultimate goals are (a) none should die from lack of blood, (b) every person knows his/her blood group. The head office of Badhan is located on the ground floor of TSC, Dhaka University. Charpoka Blood Bank Charpoka Blood Bank is an initiative by Project Charpoka. It is a voluntary blood donating project in Bangladesh. The Charpoka Blood Bank was inaugurated in 2016. It has the largest database of blood donors and it aimed to build 2 million blood donors database by 2020.

An international co-production among France, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, it was the first film from Silver Pictures to be distributed by Universal Pictures since the end of Silver's deal with Warner Bros. Released in the United States on February 28, 2014, the film received generally mixed reviews from critics but was a box- office success, grossing $222 million against its $50 million budget. Plot Two U.S. Air Marshals, Jack Hammond and alcoholic Bill Marks, separately board a British Aqualantic Airlines Boeing 767 from New York City to London. Marks sits next to Jen Summers, who has switched seats so she can sit by the window. After takeoff, Marks receives a text message on his secure phone stating that someone will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a specified bank account. Marks breaks protocol and consults Hammond, who dismisses the threat.

When Hammond is seen using his phone and suddenly goes to the rear toilet, Marks confronts him. Hammond unsuccessfully offers him some of the money and attacks. Marks secures Hammond in a choke-hold, and as Hammond raises a gun, Marks kills him exactly at the 20-minute mark. Marks finds cocaine in his briefcase, and later learns the perpetrator had blackmailed him and set him up for death. He alerts the TSA, but TSA agent Marenick informs him that the bank account is registered in his name and accuses Marks of being the perpetrator. Pilot David McMillan dies, apparently poisoned, at the 40-minute mark. Kyle, the co-pilot, convinces Marks that he is innocent. Marks searches the resentful passengers. One of them uploads a video in which Marks accuses and manhandles schoolteacher Tom Bowen, convincing the rest of the world that Marks is the perpetrator. Meanwhile, Kyle is instructed by the TSA to divert to Iceland. Marks persuades programmer Zack White to write a computer virus to make the hijacker's phone ring. The phone rings in passenger Charles Wheeler's suit pocket, but he denies it is his. As Marks roughly questions him, Wheeler suddenly dies, foaming at the mouth, at the 60-minute mark. In the first-class lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall that offers a clear shot to the pilot's seat, and discovers a dart in Wheeler's body. He asks a passenger who used the toilet recently if anybody used it after her; she replies that Summers did. Marks accuses Summers of being the hijacker. Summers gets upset, as she had stood by him. She manages to convince Marks of her innocence. In the meantime, two RAF Typhoon fighter jets meet the plane, to escort it to a military base in Iceland. Jen and Marks manage to unlock the hijacker's phone, unintentionally starting a 30-minute timer for a bomb. Through words in a television news report claiming that Marks is hijacking their flight, Marks realizes that the bomb bypassed the security checks, and finds it in Hammond's cocaine briefcase. When some passengers attack Marks, Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the first priority. Marks convinces the others of his innocence, and has them move the bomb to the rear and surround it with luggage to direct the blast outward, while everybody moves to the front of the airplane. Marks tells Kyle to descend to 8,000 feet, as the current pressure differential will destroy the airplane if the bomb explodes, although the escorting jets refuse to let Kyle deviate from his course. Marks, watching the earlier video, notices Bowen planting the phone on Wheeler, therefore implicating Bowen as the true hijacker and mastermind of the murders; White is Bowen's accomplice. Their goal was to frame Marks as a terrorist, thus ruining the reputation of the Air Marshals Service. Marks persuades White, who is more in it for the money, to try to disarm the bomb. Bowen, who wishes to die on the plane in a suicide mission, doesn't allow this and double-crosses White. Kyle suddenly descends the plane to 8,000 feet, giving Marks the opportunity to shoot and kill Bowen. White attacks Marks, still wanting to escape the aircraft, but the bomb detonates, killing him and blowing open the back of the plane. Despite the damage, Kyle manages to land the plane safely in Iceland. Marks is praised as a hero. He and Summers make plans for the start of a possible future together. Cast Filming Filming began on November 1, 2012, at York Studios in Maspeth, Queens, New York City, then continued at JFK Airport on December 7, 2012, and at Long Island MacArthur Airport. This was the inaugural movie filmed at York Studios. Soundtrack The original motion picture soundtrack was composed by John Ottman. The record was released on April 3, 2014, via Var√®se Sarabande label. Release Box office The film opened in 3,090 theaters in the United States and Canada, making $10 million on opening day. It went on to debut to $28.8 million, finishing first ahead of former box- office leader The Lego Movie, which also starred Neeson, and fellow new release Son of God. In its second weekend the film dropped 45%, grossing $15.8 million and finishing third. The film earned $92.1 million in North America and $130.6 million in other territories for a total gross of $222.8 million, against a budget of $50 million. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 224 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"While Liam Neeson is undoubtedly an asset, Non-Stop wastes its cast ‚Äî not to mention its solid premise and tense setup‚Äîon a poorly conceived story that hinges on a thoroughly unbelievable final act.\\" On another aggregation website, Metacritic, it holds a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Chris Nashawaty, writing for Entertainment Weekly, delivered a positive review, grading it \\"B\\", and observing: \\"At a certain point either you'll fasten your seat belt and go with Non-Stop's absurd, Looney Tunes logic or you won't. Against my better judgment, I went with it. After all, Neeson has shown time and again that he's the closest thing Hollywood has these days to a box office Rumpelstiltskin. He can spin cheese into gold.\\" David Denby, for The New Yorker, was ambivalent on the film's overall scope, but praised Neeson, writing, \\"Neeson, who brings enormous conviction to these late-career action roles, moves his big body through confined spaces (virtually the entire movie takes place in the airplane) with so much power that you expect him to rip out the seats.\\" Richard Corliss, for Time, had a blas√© opinion, stating that the film \\"...is no more or less than what it intends to be..\\" and posits the question: \\"Why demand logic of an action movie released in February, when audiences just want a nice, bumpy ride?\\" Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com wrote, \\"Liam Neeson is not going to be knocked off his perch as the elder statesman of B-movie tough guys any time soon...\\", and continued, \\"The rather ingenious if preposterous premise, one that only goes way off course in the heavy-handed third act...'Non-Stop' is so ridiculously entertaining in spite of its occasional lapses in real-world logic.\\" Tom Shone, reviewing for The Guardian, maintained a similar tone in his review, saying of Neeson: \\"He's at his best striding up and down the aisles of the aircraft with that big, rolling gait of his, carving out great wads of air with his hands, barking orders, his face in Rodin-ish profile, his destiny, like Mitchum's, enlivened by a nobility far greater than the film he finds himself in ‚Äì the true sign of a B-movie king\\"; and of Moore: \\"...Neeson enjoys a nice, relaxed rapport with Moore, whose looser, Keaton-esque side seems to come out when cast opposite noble hunks.\\" Home media Non-Stop was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on June 10, 2014. Possible sequel On June 11, 2014, Entertainment Weekly reported that in an interview with producer Joel Silver, he talked about the possibility of a sequel, and stated that it will not be happening on a plane again. \\"I need to think of a way to put them in an equal situation. But when I make a sequel I like to replicate the experience, not replicate the movie. I'm not going to put them on a plane again, of course. He has a touch of Sherlock Holmes in that he has to figure out what's going on and then he has to figure out how to solve it. I think that character's a great character and we'll try to figure something else to do. I haven't thought about it yet. But I have to, sooner or later.\\" References External links  Category:2014 action thriller films Category:2010s disaster films Category:2010s mystery thriller films Category:2014 films Category:Aftermath of the September 11 attacks Category:American action thriller films Category:American aviation films Category:American disaster films Category:American films Category:American mystery thriller films Category:English-language films Category:English-language French films Category:Films scored by John Ottman Category:Films about aviation accidents or incidents Category:Films about aircraft hijackings Category:French films about revenge Category:Films about terrorism in the United States Category:Films about terrorism in Europe Category:Films directed by Jaume Collet-Serra Category:Films set in 2014 Category:Films set in Iceland Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Washington, D.C.

His early articles in Harvard Business Reviews on the impact of demonetization in India received criticism from the readers on his views.

An Alawite resident, from the nearby town of Masyaf, blamed the attack on rebels stating that they did not believe there was a massacre, but that they thought the rebels were holding a number of hostages. According to him, the clashes started when the rebels shelled a Shabiha militia checkpoint in the town. In contrast, a rebel claimed that the Syrian army shelled a house where between 200 and 500 Alawites were hiding in. The next day, the casualty counts still varied but several activists said that they could confirm the deaths of 10 people.

All three blamed the rebels, not the pro-government Alawite militia, for the killing of Alawites in their village. The report also suggested that there was no massacre at all and Thomson noted that conversations with a dozen other Alawites who had fled from Aqrab further backed up the three witnesses. According to them, hundreds of civilians were trapped in one building, besieged by the rebels, for more than a week.

On September 17, 1901, a Thomas Auto-Bi was mentioned in a Japanese newspaper article and went on sale 11 days later, advertised in the same newspaper. By 1903, the company was the largest manufacturer of single-cylinder, air-cooled engines.Rafferty, p. 16 The 1904 Auto-Bi had a 2.5-horsepower four-stroke 442 cc single-cylinder engine, a belt-driven transmission, and could reach speeds of 35 mph (59 km/h). The Thomas Auto-Bi was later joined by the Auto-Tri, a three-wheeled motorcycle, and the Auto-Two Tri, a motorcycle that could hold three riders. In 1905, Thomas' motorcycle business was spun off as The Thomas Auto-Bi Company of Buffalo. The company credited Clarence Becker for having invented the Auto-Bi. The same year, one of the company directors, William C. Chadeayne, established a new record for a transcontinental crossing of the United States in 48 days. By 1912, the demand for motorcycles had dropped significantly, and the Thomas Motor company discontinued all production of two-wheeled machines.

It has been suggested he became vicar of Largo. John Wood's connection with Queen Mary's half brother, Lord James Stewart, afterwards Earl of Moray, began as early at least as 1548, when he accompanied him to France.

When active as a refinery, it was operated by the Havemeyer family's American Sugar Refining Company, which produced Domino brand sugar and was one of several sugar factories on the East River in northern Brooklyn. The family's first refinery in Williamsburg opened in 1856 and was operated by Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr., the son of American Sugar's founder. After a fire destroyed the original structures, the current complex was built in 1882 by Theodore A. Havemeyer, Thomas Winslow, and J. E. James. The American Sugar Refining Company grew to control most of the sugar industry in the United States by the late 19th century, with the Brooklyn refinery as its largest plant. Many different types of sugar were refined at the facility, and it employed up to 4,500 workers at its peak in 1919. Demand started to decline in the 1920s with advances in sugar refining and the construction of other facilities, but the refinery continued to operate until 2004. In the early 21st century, the refinery was redeveloped as office space, residential towers, and parkland. The complex's filter, pan, and finishing house was made a New York City designated landmark in 2007, because of its historical significance as one of several industrial concerns on Brooklyn's waterfront. After the failure of an initial redevelopment proposal by CPC Resources, SHoP Architects proposed another design in 2013, which was approved the next year. Demolition of the non-landmark structures in the refinery began shortly afterward, and the first new tower in the development project opened in 2017. , the refinery redevelopment consists of three completed towers; the Filter, Pan, and Finishing House; and a waterside park called Domino Park. Refinery The industrial waterfront of Brooklyn was developed in the 19th century with the construction of major shipping hubs such as Red Hook's Atlantic Basin, the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and Industry City. The village of Williamsburg in northern Brooklyn was incorporated on the bank of the East River in 1827, with most of the commercial enterprises located on the waterfront, and after becoming a part of the city of Brooklyn in 1855, Williamsburg grew quickly. German-born cousins Frederick C. Havemeyer and William Havemeyer, of the Havemeyer family, had established their first sugar refinery on Vandam Street in modern-day Hudson Square, Manhattan, in 1807. The original refinery occupied a lot of , but by the 1840s it had expanded to ten stories and occupied the whole city block. Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. (1807‚Äì1891), who joined the Havemeyer family business in 1823, helped the operation grow into a large sugar-refining corporation.  Original facility  The first member of the Havemeyer family to open a facility in Williamsburg was John C. Havemeyer, Frederick Jr.'s nephew. At the end of 1856, John C. Havemeyer and Charles E. Bertrand co-founded Havemeyer & Bertrand at the intersection of modern-day Kent Avenue and South 3rd Street. The firm assumed the name Havemeyer, Townsend & Company in 1858, then Havemeyer & Elder in 1863. The refinery employed several Havemeyer family members, including Theodore, Henry, Hector, and Charles, the latter two of whom later formed their own refinery. The Havemeyer & Elder refinery, also called the Yellow Sugar House, was the largest of the Havemeyer family plants.A Century of Sugar Refining in the United States. New York: De Vinne, n.d. Print. According to sketches, the complex included a five-story building, two single-story buildings, and a standalone chimney. During 1863 and 1865, the Havemeyers bought two lots between South 2nd and South 4th streets for expansion of the facility. Several other refineries were subsequently built in Williamsburg, creating the world's largest sugar-refining center at that time. By 1870, the neighborhood produced a majority of sugar used within the United States, and by 1881, the Havemeyer refinery processed about three-fourths of all refined sugar in the nation. Because of the depth of the East River in the vicinity of the refinery, shipments of raw sugar from overseas could be loaded directly into the facility. In February 1881, Havemeyer & Elder received a permit from the City of Brooklyn's Bureau of Buildings to add three stories to an existing six-story building on Kent Avenue between South 4th and South 5th streets. That November, Havemeyer & Elder acquired an adjacent parcel, which had previously been leased to rival refiners Wintjen, Dick and Harms. The same month, Theodore Havemeyer submitted plans for a ten-story brick structure, likely a new filter house, to the Bureau of Buildings. Reconstruction Construction on the new filter house was underway when the original refinery burned down on January 8, 1882, destroying the structures between South 3rd and South 4th streets. The fire destroyed several warehouses as well as the building that contained the refinery and finishing house. It caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage, though insurance policies covered about half of the losses, and resulted in the elimination of 1,200 to 2,000 jobs. Its destruction resulted in an increase in sugar prices nationwide. Domino Sugar Refinery behind the East River, as seen from Manhattan to the west In February 1882, Theodore Havemeyer purchased a refinery in Red Hook, Brooklyn, so that operations could restart while the new refinery was being erected. The next month, Havemeyer & Elder submitted plans for a new fireproof pan and finishing house measuring to the Bureau of Buildings. According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Theodore Havemeyer supervised the new structures' construction. Two people were variously cited as being the contractor: a building application in November 1881 mentions Thomas Winslow and J. E. James as the builders, while a subsequent application in March 1882 states that Havemeyer and James were co- architects. The rebuilding was funded in part by insurance money and the sale of assets. The reconstruction was reported to be completed by July 1883. In total, work cost $7 million (equal to $ million in ).  Operations  The new refinery structure gave the Havemeyer family a large competitive advantage due to its size, and by 1884, the rebuilt plant employed 1,000 men who made 5,000 barrels of sugar daily. The family created the Sugar Refineries Company or Sugar Trust in late 1887. The Sugar Trust was reorganized into the American Sugar Refining Company in 1891 after the previous year's passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act; prior to reorganization, the trust had controlled 98% of the United States' sugar production. An account of the plant's operation in 1894 stated that the plant was \\"the largest of its kind in the world\\" with seven buildings on of land; the refinery employed 3,000 workers and utilized of coal a day, producing 13,000 barrels of sugar daily. In 1896, American Sugar became one of the original twelve companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The company continued to prosper despite further antitrust legislation, and Frederick's son Henry Havemeyer renamed the company \\"Domino‚Äôs Sugar\\" in the early 1900s. Many different types of sugar were refined at the facility. Raw sugar was shipped from forty countries and from Florida. Raw sugar was first unloaded from piers along the East River, and mixed with water within the filter house. Then, the mixture was strained, pumped to the thirteenth floor, and placed into , circular vats called \\"blow-ups\\". Fifty pipes transported the mixture upward. Afterward, the mixture was filtered through \\"bone black\\" and canvas layers into circular tanks that measured tall and across. The solution then went into the pan house, where it was boiled at in vacuum pans that measured tall and across. Subsequently, the mixture was sent through centrifuges, where it was separated into sugar and molasses. The sugar grains were then taken to the finishing house, where they were separated in granulating machines and then roasted and dried. The roasting and drying process produced either retail-ready products such as cubes, tablets, and syrups, or individual grains that could be used as ingredients in other processes. The sugar products were packed into barrels, which were stored in the warehouses nearby. The work conditions at the refinery were described as onerous, and the workers were poorly paid, despite working shifts of at least ten hours per day. When the refinery was founded, almost all of the workers were German immigrants, while Irish immigrants were hired as outdoor laborers. Later immigrants came from eastern, northern, and southern Europe, as well as the West Indies. Workers were paid a starting salary of between $1.12 and $1.50 per day (equivalent to between $ and $ in ), with 5- or 10-cent pay increases according to tenure. The highest-paid workers at the plant earned between $100 and $150 a month (equivalent to between $ and $ in ). According to a 1900 Brooklyn Daily Eagle article, workers were employed for at least eight years on average, and many workers either lived near Kent Avenue or took trolley lines to the refinery. Most laborers at that time lived in boarding houses, though the refinery did have lockers and showers in its basement. Workers were prone to being fired at times of job insecurity, although conditions improved in the early 20th century, when wages were increased and some workers received pensions. Most employees were men, but by 1920, about one of ten workers were women.  Later usage  = Early 20th century = American Sugar established the East River Terminal Railroad in 1907 to transport sugar between the refinery and the Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, immediately to the north of the sugar refinery. American Sugar believed the refinery to be so fireproof that it did not need insurance. In 1917, during World War I, an explosion destroyed part of the plant, killing between six and twelve workers. A crowd of more than 15,000 people gathered to watch the plant burn. Initially, there was serious concern that the explosion was the work of German agents, because the Germans were the United States' adversary in the war, but the ultimate cause was found to be the ignition of sugar grains in the refinery's machinery. By 1919, the refinery had over 4,500 paid employees. The company took ownership of a pier at the end of Grand Street, one block north of the refinery, the same year. American Sugar also proposed closing the five short dead-end streets between Grand and South Fifth streets, in order to have full control of the land that comprised the refinery, but withdrew its application following local opposition. American Sugar proposed closing the five streets again in 1923, but this was also opposed by the local population. The company then threatened to move to New Jersey in 1924 over the failure to close the dead-end streets. At the time, the plant had an annual payroll of $3.5 million and manufactured of sugar per year. The New York City government allowed the company to close streets in front of the refinery. In 1926, American Sugar commenced a large renovation of the plant. As part of the project, the dock was replaced with a bulkhead, and a new boiler house was erected, as well as a warehouse that could store of sugar. The renovation was completed in 1927. The upgrades had cost $3 million and resulted in increased efficiency in the refinery's operations. Around this time, a large sign with yellow letters spelling \\"Domino Sugar\\" was erected on one of the refinery's buildings, facing the East River. By American Sugar's 50th anniversary in 1941, the refinery produced 60 grades of sugars and was a significant source of income to the municipal governments and surrounding community. It was estimated that from 1912 to 1941, the factory paid $156 million in wages, $4 million in taxes, and $2 million for water; accepted sugar from 2,252 ships; and used of coal and 17,537 barrels of oil. The Brooklyn Citizen said in 1941 that the refinery made Brooklyn the center of sugar refining in the United States, similar to how Detroit manufactured cars and Pittsburgh manufactured steel. = Decline = As seen from the Williamsburg Bridge to the southAs early as the 1920s, industry-wide changes were resulting in a reduction of utilization of the Brooklyn plant. After American Sugar completed a plant in Baltimore in 1922, refining operations in Brooklyn were reduced. The company also assumed space at 120 Wall Street in Manhattan's Financial District in 1930, using that space for its offices. The refinery's cooperage closed in 1946 after the industry stopped using wood barrels to ship sugar. Employment at the plant fell after the end of World War II in 1945; the company had 1,500 workers in 1959. Research and development activities were relocated in 1958 to American Sugar's Philadelphia facility. Despite this, the company spent $16 million on expanding the facility in the 1960s. American Sugar was renamed Amstar in 1970, and its New York City office was relocated to 1251 Avenue of the Americas in 1971. By the late 1970s, the Amstar refinery was the only remaining sugar refinery on the Williamsburg waterfront. The Amstar brand was purchased by British firm Tate & Lyle in 1988. Three years later, Amstar became known as Domino Sugar, after its primary trademark. Employment at the Domino Sugar Refinery continued to decrease, and by 1996 the plant had only 450 workers. After union workers' contracts expired in late 1998, Tate & Lyle announced upgrades to the refinery that would eliminate 100 jobs and weaken union guarantees. As a result, 284 workers went on strike in June 1999. When the strike started, Domino reduced operations at the refinery, performing much of the refining at its Baltimore plant before shipping it to Brooklyn for finishing. The strike ended in February 2001, making it one of the longest-ever in the city's history. Although over a hundred workers defected and returned to work, the remaining striking workers agreed to Tate & Lyle's plan to eliminate 110 positions. American Sugar Refining bought the brand and plant from Tate & Lyle the same year. Though the complex was able to process of sugar a year, it was only processing half that amount by 2002. The next year, American Sugar Refining announced that the Domino Sugar plant would be shuttered due to a lack of demand. The refinery stopped operating in 2004; more than 220 workers were laid off at the end of January 2004, and two dozen workers were retained for packing operations that shuttered by the end of the year. Redevelopment plans  CPC proposal  The site was purchased by CPC Resources, the for- profit arm of the Community Preservation Corporation, and Brooklyn developer Isaac Katan in July 2004 for $55.8 million. Following a wide-ranging rezoning of the north Brooklyn waterfront the next year, preservationists lobbied to save the Domino Sugar Refinery and other industrial structures on the waterfront. The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House as an official city landmark in 2007. Though the yellow \\"Domino Sugar\\" sign facing the East River was not part of the designation, the developer proposed keeping the sign by displaying it on top of the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House. CPC‚Äôs original plan for the site, designed by Rafael Vi√±oly, included up to nine buildings, four of which would be over tall. The plan called for 2,200 apartments, 660 of which would be set aside or designated as affordable housing, as well as a school; the \\"Domino Sugar\\" sign on the refinery would be preserved. The CPC plan received support from the New York City Council in 2010. However, it faced opposition from local residents, who objected to the scale of the proposed development. In 2012, CPC defaulted on its development project for the Domino Sugar Factory. Development company Two Trees Management expressed interest for the site that June, and purchased it for $185 million that October.  SHoP proposal  Two Trees submitted a new design plan for the site in 2013, designed by SHoP Architects. The new plan called for 60% more public open space on a new street grid, allowed mixed-use zoning, and was designed to connect the existing neighborhood to the new waterfront. Two Trees' plan would still set aside 660 out of the 2,200 apartments for affordable housing, but it would also include buildings of up to 50 stories, which would be some of Brooklyn‚Äôs tallest buildings. Though some neighborhood residents opposed the redevelopment, this opposition was more limited after Two Trees agreed to add more affordable housing and parkland. However, the revised plan faced objection from New York City mayor Bill de Blasio, who wanted even more affordable housing on the site, to which Walentas indicated that he was willing to revert to the older plan. In March 2014, the new plans were approved by the City Planning Commission. At the time, the redevelopment would have cost $1.5 billion. The agency signed off on the proposal after the de Blasio administration struck a deal with Two Trees Management to include more affordable housing units. That deal required Two Trees to include 700 below-market-rate units, which was 40 more than what was originally offered and 260 more than what the CPC wanted. In exchange, Two Trees was allowed to build its towers of up to 55 stories. Three floors would be built on top of the existing factory building.  Redevelopment progress  In 2014, photographer David Allee explored the abandoned portions of the refinery, stating that it smelled of \\"creme brulee mixed with mold and rot\\". The same year, from May through July, artist Kara Walker exhibited her piece A Subtlety at the refinery's Syrup Shed. After the closure of the exhibition, the non-landmarked portions of the refinery were to be demolished, as had been planned before the show. In mid-2014, demolition of the structures commenced; demolition was mostly complete by December 2014. Excavation for the first building in the complex, 325 Kent Avenue, started in May 2015. Two Trees also cleaned out the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House, which still contained its old sugar-refining machinery. In February 2017, the developers of the redevelopment project opened a housing lottery for the 104 affordable-housing apartments at 325 Kent Avenue, which garnered 87,000 applicants, or about 837 for every apartment. 325 Kent Avenue opened in July 2017, with the first residents moving into the building the next month. A second residential building, 260 Kent Avenue, started construction in early 2018. The LPC approved a redesign for the landmarked portion of the refinery complex in November 2017. Domino Park, a public park along the East River waterfront, opened in June 2018. The interconnected towers at One South First and Ten Grand opened the following year: One South First opened in September 2019, followed by Ten Grand that November. The first office tenant at Ten Grand signed a lease for space in that building in December 2019.  Buildings  The Domino Sugar Refinery site spans on the East River north of the Williamsburg Bridge. When the redevelopment is complete, it will include of community and commercial space; of office space; 2,800 apartments, of which 700 will be affordable; and of parkland on the waterfront, which is part of Domino Park. The entire complex will eventually contain five residential buildings and cost $3 billion.  Residential and commercial towers  = 325 Kent Avenue = Domino Park, looking east toward 325 Kent Avenue 325 Kent Avenue, a 16-story, tower designed by Audrey Matlock Architects, is located on the east side of Kent Avenue. The building contains 522 residential units, 105 of which are affordable-housing apartments, and the units range from studio apartments to two-bedroom apartments. 325 Kent Avenue has of residential space and of ground-floor retail space. The building contains amenities such as a rooftop deck, a fitness center, a residents' lounge, and a courtyard on the fourth floor. The lower portion of the facade is made of copper, while the upper portion consists of zinc. The massing of the structure consists of two stepped towers on the north and south, which step down gradually from west to east. The tops of the two wings are connected on the western side of the building, creating a rectangular hole on the western facade and giving it a \\"doughnut\\" shape. = One South First and Ten Grand = The 45-story One South First tower (also known as 260 Kent Avenue) and the 24-story Ten Grand tower are located between South 1st and South 2nd streets, north of the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House on the western side of Kent Avenue. The structures were designed by Cookfox. One South First contains 330 residential units, 66 of which are affordable-housing apartments; the units range from studios to two-bedroom apartments. Ten Grand contains of retail space and of office space. The combined structure's amenities include a rooftop deck with cabanas, a fitness center, a residents' lounge, a swimming pool, and spaces for coworking. The buildings comprise a single structure; the massing is designed so that the upper stories of One South First are carried over the top of Ten Grand upon a glass-clad structure. The facade is made of precast concrete, which the architects stated is based on sugar crystals' molecular structure. The panels for One South First generally measure , while the panels for Ten Grand and the shared base measure .  Park  Domino Park is located along the East River waterfront, west of Kent Avenue. Designed by the architectural firm of James Corner, the public park includes pieces of machinery from the factory, as well as gardens, a play area for children, and various fields. An elevated walkway runs along the length of the park.  Refinery  When the refinery was rebuilt in 1882‚Äì1883, it was composed of several structures on the west side of Kent Avenue between South 2nd and South 6th streets. It was described upon its completion as being the largest sugar refinery in the Americas. The Pan, Filter, and Finishing House is located between South 2nd and South 3rd streets. Immediately adjacent, between South 3rd and South 4th streets, was a 6-story storehouse and a machine shop. The block between South 4th and South 5th streets was a 7-story refinery building, while the block to the south was a single-story detached storehouse. Only the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House remains of the refinery complex. =Pan, Filter, and Finishing House= Pan, Filter, and Finishing House, seen from the south The extant structure of the refinery consists of the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House, a New York City designated landmark designed by Theodore Havemeyer, Thomas Winslow, and J. E. James. The building is located between South 2nd and South 3rd streets. The 10-story pan house and Finishing House sections are tall while the 13-story filter house section is tall, including a chimney. These structures are interconnected and measured north‚Äìsouth by west‚Äìeast. The Pan, Filter, and Finishing House was one of the tallest buildings in Brooklyn when finished, rivaling the heights of early skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan's Financial District. The Pan, Filter, and Finishing House is made mostly of reddish brick, which are thick on the lower stories and thick on the upper stories. The massing has no setbacks, though the facade has decorative elements on the upper stories. On the eastern facade, along Kent Avenue, there are vertical brick pilasters. On the western facade, facing the East River, the facade contains bricks that are recessed to form patterns such as chevrons and polygons. In some places, bluestone was used in belt courses and keystones. Most of the windows have brick arches. The building was fueled by coal, which required a chimney to ventilate safely. The chimney was among the region's tallest when the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House was built. The top section of the chimney was expanded in the 1920s using curved brick. To deliver coal to the refinery, American Sugar used ten coal barges, each with a capacity of between . The interior was outfitted with brick floors atop brick flat-topped arches, which were supported by iron beams and 66 cast-iron columns. Fire escapes, fire extinguishers, and electric lights were also present in the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House. The interior of the building will be converted to of office space once its 2020s renovation is completed. =Former buildings= The former buildings at the refinery include the Syrup Shed, the Wash House, the Turbine Room, the Power House, and the Pump House. Several gantry cranes were situated on the waterfront, unloading sugar. The cranes ran on tracks that were long. The complex also contained a \\"bin structure\\" in which sugar grains were categorized by size, as well as conveyor bridges leading down to the refinery building. A yellow \\"Domino Sugar\\" sign, dating from the 1920s, was hung on one of the buildings facing the waterfront; it is planned to be reinstalled on the Pan, Filter, and Finishing House. A two-story boiler house was located along the East River, west of the refinery building. A warehouse was located adjacent to the boiler house. Five large pumps drew in of saltwater from the East River, which was used for the condensers and then pumped back out. The refinery also used large amounts of fresh water: in 1903, it was estimated that the refinery alone used two percent of Brooklyn's water supply.

She was the second woman winemaker in Santa Barbara County when she started working in the industry in 1981. She goes by the nickname \\"Pinot Czarina.\\" Personal life and education Tanner grew up in Kelseyville, California. She graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in chemistry in 1976. After graduating, she started working in the air pollution industry. One winter she worked in Glendive, Montana. After Glendive, she quit her job and moved back to Kelseyville. Tanner was married to the owner of The Hitching Post. Tanner is now married to winemaker Ariki Hill. Career In 1980, Tanner started working as on the bottling department, putting wine labels on bottles, at Konocti Winery in Kelseyville. When the winery learned that she had studied chemistry she became a lab technician. She worked there for one year and worked with Andre Tchelistcheff. She was suggested by Tchelistcheff for a job at Firestone Winery. She joined Firestone in 1981 as a winemaker. At Firestone she was able to improve her skills at wine tasting and in 1984 she started her on consulting firm. Her first client was making wine for The Hitching Post. She was one of the first winemakers to use Pinot grapes from Bien Nacido Vineyard. In late 2010 she retired from the wine industry. In 2012, Tanner was named winemaker for Sierra Madre Vineyard. At Sierra Madre, she makes Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Pinot blanc wines. Lane Tanner Winery Tanner started her own winery in 1989, Lane Tanner Winery. The label became the first in the Central Coast region to devote itself to Pinot noir. The winery is located in the Santa Maria Valley AVA and the first wine was a 1989 vintage. The label made approximately 1,800 cases a year and specialized in Pinot noir. They also made Syrah. The Pinot noir grapes came from three vineyards in Santa Barbara County: Julia's Vineyard, Bien Nacido Vineyard, and Melville Vineyard. The Syrah grapes came from French Camp Vineyard which is located in San Luis Obispo County. Tanner's wines aim to stay low in alcohol content and sulfites. The latter is because Tanner is allergic to them. The Pinot was fermented for over two weeks with yeast. It was then aged for eleven months in 46 percent French oak barrels. The last vintage was in 2009. The back of her Pinot bottles had the motto: \\"laugh more- flirt often,\\" written on them.

It is also the first and only installment of the Fatty Bear point-and-click games, although the character was also used in the mini-game compilations Fatty Bear's Fun Pack and the crossover spinoff Putt-Putt & Fatty Bear's Activity Pack. In July 2013, Tommo bought the Fatty Bear license for the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. Plot A girl named Kayla falls asleep the night before her birthday. While she sleeps, her toys and stuffed animals come to life to prepare for her party. Fatty Bear searches through the house looking for ingredients with which to bake a cake. Unfortunately, it is not as easy as Fatty Bear thought - he had planned on baking the cake, but in the kitchen was a mysterious package. When he curiously inspects it, a small brown puppy pops out of it and promptly runs away, tearing the ribbon on the box; Fatty Bear now has to return the puppy into the box, make a cake and get the house decorated for the birthday party. Fatty Bear helps a doll named Gretchen set up for Kayla's party by blowing balloons in her bedroom and finding the letters for a \\"Happy Birthday\\" sign that the puppy ran off with. In the kitchen, the ingredients he found are used to bake a cake with the assistance of Matilda Rabbit. Then, using a bone and a ribbon he found, he lures the puppy back into her present box and wraps the box back up. Finally, Fatty Bear jumps into Kayla's bed, going back to stuffed animal form before she wakes up. The next morning, Kayla awakens and announces that her room is beautiful. Her father comes to wish her a happy birthday and deliver her surprise, which turns out to be the puppy that rushes into the room and leaps onto her bed. Kayla thanks Fatty Bear for the best birthday she's ever had, giving him a big hug. Fatty Bear winks at the player and the credits roll.

History The Galway Bay Steamboat Company was registered in November 1871. In 1872, a paddle steamer named The Citie of the Tribes began service as the first regular service between Galway and the Aran Islands. Launched on 17 August 1872, she was built by JT Eltringham & Co, South Shields (Yard No. 24), and was 117 gross tons. She was sold in 1903 to Charles Duncan in Middlesbrough and broken up in 1910. She was replaced in 1893 when the SS Duras made her first trip to Aran. This ship was commissioned by the company as a passenger and cargo vessel and was also used as a tug assisting sailing ships in and out of Galway port. She was built in South Shields by JP Rennoldson and Sons Ltd (Yard No. 146) and launched on 24 November 1892. She made three sailings a week to the islands and from 1898 onwards, during the Summer, she made three sailings a week to Ballyvaughan. The single fare to Aran was 3/- for saloon and 2/6 for deck passengers. The fare to Ballyvaughan was 2/-. In 1899 it was reported that the company had been receiving ¬£700 per annum for the regular service to the Aran Islands three times per week.Hansard 20 February 1899 vol 66 cc1460- In July 1912, the SS Dun Aengus replaced the Duras. The Duras was kept for towage and relief works until 1921, when she was sold to Frederick Palmer in Boston, Lincolnshire and later other owners before she was broken up in Denmark in 1954. The SS Dun Aengus was 120 feet long, with a beam of 24 feet and depth of 10ft 6in. She was 234 gross tons and had a steam engine from Ross and Duncan of Glasgow.Liffey Ships & Shipbuilding. Pat Sweeney. Mercier Press Ltd. 2010 She was originally purchased by means of a ¬£7,500 loan from the Congested Districts Board. Following the waiving of the sums outstanding on the loan, the government made agreement with the company under the Aran Islands (Transport) Acts, 1936 and 1946,Aran Islands Transport Act, 1946, Section 4 that the vessel would transfer to the government if the company ceased to operate the service to the Aran Islands. The SS Dun Aengus continued to run until 1958. A new boat built in Dublin, MV Naomh √âanna, operated the service between 1958 and 1988.

Expulsion of individuals infected with leprosy to quarantined areas or special institutions has been the general protocol since ancient times and was the recommended course of action by the Leprosy Conference of Berlin 1897. As a result, the exclusion and quarantining of people infected with leprosy became law, hence leprosy colonies were formed. The inhabitants of these colonies had very little legal recourse in preventing their exclusion and, even after they were treated and cured, many had trouble reintegrating into society. Even by the 1960s, when Leprosy was highly treatable and curable, it still resulted in repulsion, and the exclusion of sufferers, by the general populace. As leprosy became curable, the focus of study shifted towards investigating the social aspects of the disease. This has become relevant due to the fact that the disease is making a resurgence and is proving resistant to previous remedies.  Hawaii  Kalaupapa, a small island of Hawaii was a legally mandated place of banishment for citizens with leprosy. ‚ÄúIt became so after 1865, when the Kingdom of Hawaii passed ‚ÄúAn Act to Prevent the Spread of Leprosy‚Äù and effectively defined people diagnosed with leprosy as criminals. The State of Hawaii did not repeal the law until 1969.‚Äù The historian Carolyn Strange argues that the history of this island with its forced segregation, stigma and death contrasted with its present state as a tourist destination and as a sacred place for Christian pilgrimages which makes this island a symbol for human rights struggles and integration. By recognizing the issues and the rights of those who were cast as criminals for simply being ill with an infectious disease and segregated against their will, it can aid present society with the future handling of people with infectious diseases; a main theme when discussing the stigmas attached to Leprosy colonies.  The Philippines  In 1904 a Leper Colony was founded in the Philippines on a remote island called Culion; also known as the Island of Living Dead. Most of these people lived in isolation and engaged in crude agriculture and fishing and most lived in great poverty. As time went on and medical advancements were made towards the curing of leprosy, the island welcomed people with non- leprosy as settlers, many of whom were the relatives and friends of the pre- existing patients.Handog, Evangeline B., Ma. Teresita G. Gabriel, and Cheryl C. Co. \\"Leprosy in the Philippines: a review.\\" International Journal of Dermatology 50, no. 5 (May 2011): 573-581 As the disease became less of a threat and cures and treatments became available, the stigma behind the disease began to lessen and the quality of life for those on the island improved. ‚ÄúBiomedical research facilities have been built there which provide no-fee medical consultation, diagnostic and treatment services to patients with leprosy and other skin diseases.‚Äù As the fear aspect of the disease lessened the community became more accepting in the Philippines and the same efforts to distort history as in Hawaii are not existent as the Cullion Leper Colony still exists today and helps house and treat the current population with skin disorders.  China  In China, various causes contributed to the long-term existence and spread of leprosy. In the past, people frequently lived in poverty under poor health conditions with overcrowding and poor nutrition.Xiang-Sheng, Chen, Li Wen-Zhong, Jiang Cheng, and Ye Gan-Yun. 2001. \\"Leprosy in China: epidemiological trends between 1949 and 1998.\\" Bulletin Of The World Health Organization 79, no. 4: 306. As in other countries with a history of a leprosy endemic, these factors are consistent in China as they are with other nations. Most leprosy colonies were located in isolated places with poor transportation routes and with housing that was on the verge of collapse. The leprosy colonies had a shortage of medical materials and the health of these people was greatly neglected.Jianping, Shen, Liu Musang, and Zhou Min. \\"Current situation of leprosy colonies/leprosaria and their future in P.R. China.\\" Leprosy Review 78, no. 3 (September 2007): 281-289 This was a result of the stigma that those infected received from the general public and holds true to form of other similar colonies throughout the world. Chinese experts now recommend that the small and isolated leprosy colonies should be closed and that newer more modern centres should be established that are more integrated within society. The newly established centres should act as place for reference, training and research on the disease.Gusm√£o, APB, and MJM Antunes. \\"To be with leprosy and to work as a nurse: histories of fight and overcoming [sic] [Portuguese].\\" Revista Brasileira De Enfermagem 62, no. 6 (November 2009): 820-824. As in other countries once the disease became treatable much of the stigma was removed from the sufferers of the disease and an effort to increase of the lifespan and end the isolation of these people became a mandate.  Brazil  In Brazil the isolation of people with Leprosy was compulsory by law from the years 1920-1962 but in reality operated in this fashion until the 1980s.Patricia, Teixeira Celestino, et al. \\"Hansen's disease: stigma and prejudice faced by inmates of Casa de Acolhida Souza Araujo in the city of Rio Branco [Portuguese].\\" Revista Nursing 14, no. 166 (March 2012): 164-170. This, was largely based on the stigmas associated with the disease. Data were collected and were further analyzed, utilizing the Stigma reference. The results indicated that after entry in the institution, these patients got their broken family bonds, the citizens lost their rights, regarding the situation, they took upon a new life, in the new environment.RETIEF, FRAN√áOIS, and LOUISE CILLIERS. \\"Die ontstaan en ontwikkeling van melaatsheid in die antieke tyd. (Afrikaans).\\" Suid-Afrikaanse Tydskrif Vir Natuurwetenskap En Tegnologie 28, no. 1 (March 2009): 1-12 These patients had difficulty receiving proper care due to the nature of their disease during the time periods these colonies operated. ‚ÄúLeprosy, fraught with prejudice and stigma in the early 20s was treated for decades with stringent policies of compulsory isolation of patients in hospitals colonies. Because of prejudice, there was difficulty in hiring staff to maintain these establishments.‚Äù The misinformation and at the inability to treat the disease was the cause of this stigma towards those infected. ‚ÄúIt was found that leprosy causes a great impact on the everyday lives of these people through the stigma and prejudice related to lack of knowledge about the transmission, control and cure of the disease and the ancient history it carries.‚Äù  Leprosy Today  Leprosy has existed in the world since ancient times and continues to exist in the world today, despite being largely curable and treatable. The stigmas associated with the disease have impacted on those suffering from Leprosy in a highly negative way that up until recently was socially accepted. ‚ÄúThe influence of the Christian Church was such that the ritualised banning of lepers became incorporated into the treatment of elephantiasis -- against the advice of physicians like Caelius Aurelianus (4th/5th century AD)\\". Gradually the name lepra (leprosy) replaced elephantiasis, which ensured the stigmatisation of leprosy as an \\"unclean disease\\" with divine punishment for previous sins‚Äîa tragic misconception which persisted up to modern times.DL Ribas, et al. \\"Leprosy: stigma and prejudice lived by institucionalized [sic] patients in Santa Catarina State, Brazil (1940-1960) [Portuguese].\\" Revista Brasileira De Enfermagem 61, (November 2, 2008): 708-712. The disease was seen as unclean, highly contagious and left people horrifically scarred from its effects, this allowed for the sufferers to become easily stigmatized against. From researching various leper colonies from around the world the disease has been most prevalent in those who live in poor areas, with poor sanitation and drinking water. The disease also became connected to being poor, which goes hand in hand with the idea that it was a result of being unclean. This stigmatizing of people due to misconceptions of how the disease is transmitted and prejudices against the people who more commonly contract the disease can be seen in other diseases today such as AIDS and SARS with homophobia and racism as stigmas attached to these diseases. In a comparative study between AIDS and Leprosy there was determined to still be stigmas attached to each, with AIDS receiving a more constant form of stigmatization but with Leprosy receiving the more harsh form due to the visual aspects of the disease and the isolation and seclusion associated with those who have it.Stevelink, S., A.M., H., and V. Augustine. \\"Stigma and social participation in Southern India: Differences and commonalities among persons affected by leprosy and persons living with HIV/AIDS.\\" Psychology, Health & Medicine 16, no. 6 (December 2011): 695-707. The study of social stigma attached to disease is still a relevant topic and as the authors referenced in this article have concluded that as time passes and understanding of the disease scientifically is gained and cures and treatments become available, the stigma associated with the disease lessens. When people understand something they cease to fear it and become more accepting; however, that is not to say that there are still those who hold prejudice and discriminate against those who do have contagious diseases and use it as a forum of class warfare and racism.

Early life W≈Çadys≈Çaw Moes was born in the Moes Palace near Wierbka, in southern Poland. He was the second son of the six children of Aleksander Juliusz Moes (1856‚Äì1928), a large landowner, factory owner and philanthropist, and his wife Countess Janina MiƒÖczy≈Ñska (1869‚Äì1946), whose family used the Suchekomnaty coat of arms. He was also the grandson of Christian August Moes (1810‚Äì1872), an important Polish industrialist of Dutch origin.http://www.jura-pilica.com/?1872-1874-aleksander-moes,34, In May 1911, on the advice of doctors, he spent a spring holiday with his family at the Lido in Venice, staying at the Grand Hotel des Bains. There, he attracted the attention of the German writer Thomas Mann, who used him as the inspiration for Tadzio ‚Äì a character of his novella Death in Venice, published in 1912.Gilbert Adair, The Real Tadzio (Short Books, 2001) Katia Mann recalled that her husband's idea for the story came during a holiday at the Grand H√¥tel des Bains in 1911: Moes was taught by private tutors and later studied at Saint Stanislaus Kostka's Gymnasium in Warsaw. In 1920, Moes was a volunteer uhlan in the Polish-Soviet War. Later, he ran a landed estate and a horse farm in Ud√≥rz that he inherited from his father, who died in 1928. Marriage and later life In 1935, he married a noblewoman ‚Äì Anna Belina-Brzozowska (1911‚Äì1978), whose family used the Belina coat of arms. They had two children, Aleksander (1936‚Äì1955) and Maria (born 1946). He was also the uncle of the Polish film and television actor Jerzy Moes. In 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, Moes was taken prisoner in the Battle of the Bzura and sent to Oflag, where he spent almost six years. With the establishment of the communist regime in Poland in 1945, he was deprived of his entire property. He was forced to earn his living mainly as a translator and worked at the Iranian Embassy in Warsaw. In 1964, Moes gave an interview to Andrzej Do≈Çegowski, the Polish translator of Mann‚Äôs works, which was published in August 1965 in the German magazine Twen, revealing that he himself had been the inspiration for the writer‚Äôs character Tadzio in Death in Venice: During the last years of his life, Moes often stayed with his daughter Maria in France. He died in Warsaw and was buried in the Moes family plot in the graveyard on the hill of St Peter in Pilica, southern Poland.http://www.jura- pilica.com/?cmentarze,271#cmentarzswpiotra  References  *Gilbert Adair: The Real Tadzio: Thomas Mann's 'Death in Venice' and the Boy Who Inspired It. 2001.

The colossal Pella Palace on the bank of the Neva River was named after the birthplace of Alexander the Great The Greek Plan or Greek Project () was an early solution to the Eastern Question which was advanced by Catherine the Great in the early 1780s. It envisaged the partition of the Ottoman Empire between the Russian and Habsburg Empires followed by the restoration of the Eastern Roman Empire centered in Constantinople.  Outline  Like her predecessors, Catherine concerned herself with the Orthodox Christians under Ottoman rule; she sponsored the Orlov Revolt in the Morea during the Russo- Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, and invited many Greeks like Ioannis Varvakis to settle in Russia, mainly in Crimea and New Russia. She conceived that one of her grandsons, appropriately named Constantine, would become the first emperor of the restored Byzantium. Another important consideration was Russia's goal of free access to the Mediterranean Sea through the Bosphorus, which the Ottomans controlled. For this plan to succeed, the Great European Powers would need to agree to it and the Danube powers to cooperate. In May 1780, Catherine arranged a secret meeting with Joseph II, the Holy Roman Emperor, in Mogilyov. In a series of letters from September 1781, Catherine and Joseph discussed their plans to partition the Ottoman Empire and restore the Byzantine Empire. The Austro-Russian alliance was formalized in May 1781. The Greek Plan was masterminded by Prince Potemkin who gave Greek names to the newly founded towns in New Russia (e.g., Odessa and Kherson). Byzantine symbolism was highlighted in new churches such as Kherson Cathedral. Another meeting of the Russian and Austrian monarchs was arranged as part of Catherine's Crimean journey of 1787. Both countries declared war on the Ottoman Empire later that year. Joseph's death in 1790, followed by the Treaty of Jassy and the Treaty of Sistova, in which Austria gained little, effectively ended the agreement. Cities named in Greek during this period The Sophia Cathedral in Tsarskoe Selo was designed as a small-scale replica of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople The following major cities were given Greek inspired names during this period. Some of them were new settlements, others were renamed.\\"–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞ —Å –≥—Ä–µ—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –∏–º–µ–Ω–∞–º–∏\\" , Sevatopolskaya Gazeta, July 20, 2006 (retrieved August 17, 2014) *Kherson (1778), after Chersonesus *Yevpatoria (1784), from Eupator: ŒïœÖ¬∑œÄŒ±œÑœâœÅ \\"(of) noble father\\", after Mithridates VI of Pontus, whose dominions included Crimea *Mariupol (1780), after Maria Feodorovna *Melitopol (1784, renamed 1842 after Melita (ancient port city) which existed in the vicinity) *Nikopol (renamed so in 1786 after Nike, the goddess of victory) *Ovidiopol (1793) after Ovidius *Sevastopol (1784) *Simferopol (1784) *Stavropol (1777) *Tiraspol (1792), named after Tyras, the Ancient name for the Dniester river *Odessa (1795, after Odessos, thought to be located in the vicinity) *There was an attempt to rename Stary Krym into Levkopol (Leukopolis, \\"White City\\"), but the name never attained popularity.

It was written by Guy Burt and directed by David Leland. It originally aired on June 17, 2012. The episode deals with the grief of the Pope for Juan, killed by Cesare for shaming the Borgia name. While Lucrezia chooses to marry Alfonso d'Aragona, Girolamo Savonarola is burned at the stake with a fake confession of heresy. Cesare admits his guilt to the Pope, who releases him from his cardinal's vows, but when Cesare asks for his father's forgiveness, the Pope is poisoned by Cardinal Della Rovere's assassin, leaving the season with a cliff-hanger. Plot The episode begins with Savonarola (Steven Berkoff) being tortured, while Rodrigo (Jeremy Irons) demands of Cesare either a confession from the friar or his brother Juan. At Castel Sant'Angelo, Micheletto (Sean Harris) is trying to get a confession of heresy, but Savonarola says he will only confess to Cesare. That afternoon, Machiavelli (Julian Bleach) is a guest of Cesare's and they discuss the difficulty of extracting a confession from the rebel. Cesare (Fran√ßois Arnaud) knows that a confession is needed to recant all that was preached but Savonarola has proven stronger than he thought over the lengthy torture. Machiavelli states what he thinks to be obvious: if Rome needs that confession, then give it to them. In the dungeons, Cesare, tired of Savonarola's obstinacy, signs the confession in his name; Micheletto then pries out the friar's tongue, so he can reveal to no one about Cesare's deceit. In the hallway of the papal suites Lucrezia (Holliday Grainger) encounters her latest suitor, Alfonso d‚ÄôAragona (Sebastian de Souza). Alfonso does not recognize her so she grasps the opportunity to have a little fun with him, pretending to be Lucrezia's intermediary. They both flirt with each other until Alfonso tells her to lie to Lucrezia that he is inept and to come with him. He doesn't care about prestige, he is looking for love, and this wins over Lucrezia, who kisses him. Rodrigo meanwhile tells Lucrezia to not dismiss Alfonso without meeting him. Later, Alfonso is shocked when he sees Lucrezia's name being announced and sees her walk into Rodrigo's court. Lucrezia then in front of the whole court and much to Rodrigo's surprise immediately agrees to marry Alfonso. Rodrigo is informed that a body has been found. He proceeds to identify it, but it's not Juan's. Cardinal Sforza (Peter Sullivan) tells Rodrigo that he has ordered the searching of mortuaries, as he doesn't want to rule out any possibilities. Giulia Farnese (Lotte Verbeek) and Rodrigo pay mortuaries a visit in the dark of the night. While scanning through bodies, Rodrigo stumbles upon Juan's body. He is visibly moved and instructs the body be taken home. Later a pleased Cesare enters Rodrigo's chamber in order to hand him the friar's confession but he's shocked to see Juan's body lying there. In an explosive scene, Cesare and Lucrezia tell Rodrigo that they will not mourn his death, because Juan had no respect for anyone, including his family. Rodrigo tells the both of them to leave his sight. He refuses to have a funeral until Juan's killer is found. The friar Savonarola is meanwhile tied to a stake to be burnt, with all the townspeople jeering him. Rodrigo, wearing his ceremonial robes, walks up to Savonarola and tells him that if he repents, he might then forgive his sins. The friar in return spits in the Pope's face. Rodrigo then walks back and instructs that Savonarola be burnt. In Lucrezia's bedroom Lucrezia asks if Cesare will marry her and he plays on the words to tease her. He says as she wishes, they shall have to run away together. Eventually, he states that he cannot, because his hands have seen too much of blood and sin. Later, Cesare looks for his father and finds him still in the mourning chamber. He confesses to Rodrigo that it was he who killed Juan, for the honor of the family. He then asks Rodrigo to relieve him of his robes of a cardinal and to grant him his forgiveness. Cesare hangs up his robe of a cardinal, and hands his ring over to Rodrigo. The day after, Cesare seeks out Vanozza and Lucrezia to tell them that Juan's funeral has been arranged. Vanozza reminds Cesare that his father will not have it but Cesare insists. In the ballroom, surrounded by well-wishers, Cesare brings Lucrezia and Alfonso's hands together to signify their betrothal and the festivities begin. The Pope sits in the darkened mourning chamber while below the ballroom is filled with dancing and music. He lifts Juan's body into his arms and the corpse of the grown man is changed to body of a sleeping child, then he lays him on the grass in the Vatican gardens and begins to dig the soil. Inside the Palace, Lucrezia and Cesare dance together closely; Vanozza and Alfonso watch them suspiciously. Eventually, Vanozza asks Cesare what exactly is he celebrating, Cesare tells her that the happiness of his sister's marriage far outweighs the grief of his brother's death, but she remarks that they are all dancing on his brother's grave. Rodrigo arrives at the ceremony with soiled clothes and tells Cesare that he wants to speak with him. The Pope's taster, Cardinal della Rovere's assassin (Jesse Bostick), meanwhile pours some wine for Rodrigo. Rodrigo tells Cesare that what Cesare did is also Rodrigo's fault, as he brought Cesare to this. Cesare asks Rodrigo his forgiveness, and just as Rodrigo is about to reply, he begins to choke like his taster, who suddenly falls to the ground dead. Cesare yells for help, while Rodrigo collapses to the ground, apparently dead. Lucrezia, Giulia, Vanozza, Alfonso and some cardinals rush into the room, and they are all shocked at the sight. Production \\"The Confession\\" was written by Guy Bert and directed by executive producer David Leland. In an interview, actor Francois Arnaud said that he was pleased the first time he read Bert's script, calling it one of his favorites and believing that it \\"captured the strongest moments of all the characters\\" and finished transforming his character into a \\"warrior.\\" He added, \\"I couldn't believe someone had written on paper my exact thoughts for this character for the past two years. It's like if I had written it myself, you know? I was really happy.\\" Arnaud remarked that the finale contained elements from Game of Thrones and Dawson's Creek, a reference to the combination of power and politics in tandem with Lucrezia's romance. Arnaud continued that the finale \\"reaches new stages of emotional depth\\" explaining that his character's admittance of guilt to his father over Juan created as much drama as the actual killing of Juan, which took place in the previous episode. \\"I don't think [the murder was] something that he particularly enjoyed doing, but I think Cesare has great will power,\\" Arnaud noted. \\"I think it's something that he focused on and I think he can control his mind into having no second thoughts. And I think that's the only way you can rule in that era, really.\\" While David Oakes is still credited in the title sequence, his only appearance is as a corpse. Oakes stated, \\"It‚Äôs a good season finale. They wouldn‚Äôt have killed me off in Episode 9, if there wasn‚Äôt enough to do in the final episodes.\\" Reception Ratings \\"The Confession\\" first aired on June 17, 2012 in the United States to an estimated 517,000 viewers. Reviews TV Fanatic columnist Dan Forcella praised Cesare and Lucrezia's character development as well as Grainger's performance. Les Chappell of The A.V. Club thought that Irons' reaction to Juan's death was his strongest of the season and said of the burial scene: \\"Certainly Irons conveys a terrific sense of blind grief in the moment, and the scoring by Trevor Morris as always matches the mood of the scene perfectly, but there‚Äôs a fantastical sense to it‚Äîparticularly the way that Alexander imagines Juan as the boy he once was, before his demons consumed him‚Äîthat feels out of place with the show‚Äôs aesthetic. Far more effective is what he does afterwards, walking into the wedding reception in mud-stained robes, taking Cesare aside and finally admitting the role his favoritism played Juan‚Äôs death.\\" Nominations It received three nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards 2012 for Outstanding Costumes for a Series (Gabriella Pescucci), Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series and Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Trevor Morris).

The professor and former pastor argues that women serving as activists for the black church are sometimes put into institutional categories for their political expression by the black church itself. Grant expounds on this and similar notions in her writings. She explains while it may sound like a compliment that black women are called the \\"backbone\\" of the church, in fact the author chides \\"the telling portion of the word backbone is 'back'. It has become apparent to me that most of the ministers who use this term have reference to location rather than function. What they really mean is that women are in the 'background' and should be kept there.\\"Jacquelyn Grant, Black Theology and the Black Women, (NY: Orbis Books, 1993), 325. Grant represents the first generation of womanist theologians. She differs from forerunners such as James H. Cone, whose work was seen as male- centered and devoid of sources that gave voice to the experiences of black women. Grant highlights this critique of Cone's work by pointing out that \\"Black women have been invisible in theology including black theology and feminist theology\\".Jacquelyn Grant, \\"Black Theology and the Black Women,\\" in James H. Cone and Gayraud S. Wilmore ed., Black Theology: A Documentary History, Volume I, 1996-1979, (NY: Orbis Books, 1993), 326. Grant also notably argues that the oppression of black women is different then that of black men. She also advances the idea that black women are more oppressed and ultimately need more liberation than white women and black men. Grant and Cone's work served as foundational for scholar Delores S. Williams to respond to and expand upon. Williams produced a commonly -referenced definition of womanist theology. Williams concluded that Book reception Jacquelyn Grant is widely regarded as an important \\"womanist theologian\\". Her book White Women's Christ and Black Women's Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response was a best seller. The text is described as laying out the complex relationship between Christology and feminism. In it, Grant explores the central idea by giving voice to women other than those of European descent and putting them squarely into the equation. Through outliningthese relationships, Grant examines the intersecting concepts of Christology and womanist theology. As a result of exploring the two concepts together, Grants helps address the historical and modern-day experiences of black women. Grant's work in White Women's Christ and Black Women's Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response conveyed the \\"tri-dimensional reality render[ing Black women's] situation a complex one. One could say that not only are they the oppressed of the oppressed, but their situation represents the 'particular within the particular,'\\" as author Joan M. Martin points out in The Notion of Difference for Emerging Women Ethics. By exploring the relationship between black women and Jesus as a \\"divine co-sufferer\\", Grant's contribution to womanist theology provides meaningful examples and a theoretical framework to fuel conversation and research on an assortment of topics dealing with black women's experiences.

It is located in Maryland, at Crampton's Gap at South Mountain. Civil War correspondent George Alfred Townsend, or \\"Gath\\", built the arch in 1896, and it was dedicated October 16, 1896. It is claimed that the arch is the only monument in the world dedicated to journalists killed in combat. However, a tree in Arlington National Cemetery was also dedicated as a war correspondents' memorial in 1986. Journalists At Risk: Reporting America's Wars, p9, George Sullivan, Twentieth Century Books, 2005. Also see http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/reporters.htm . In addition, there are at least two prominent US monuments more broadly commemorating journalists killed in combat or otherwise in the line of duty - the Overseas Press Club Memorial Press Center building in New York City which was dedicated in 1954 ; and the Freedom Forum Journalists Memorial in Freedom Park, Arlington, Virginia, dedicated in 1996 . The Journalists Memorial monument with a similar broad dedication and purportedly the first of its kind in Europe, was inaugurated by Reporters Without Borders in Bayeux, France in 2006 Description The book George Alfred Townsend describes the monument: > In appearance the monument is quite odd. It is fifty feet high and forty > feet broad. Above a Moorish arch sixteen feet high built of Hummelstown > purple stone are super-imposed three Roman arches. These are flanked on one > side with a square crenellated tower, producing a bizarre and picturesque > effect. Niches in different places shelter the carving of two horses' heads, > and symbolic terra cotta statuettes of Mercury, Electricity and Poetry. > Tables under the horses' heads bear the suggestive words \\"Speed\\" and \\"Heed\\"; > the heads are over the Roman arches. The three Roman arches are made of > limestone from Creek Battlefield, Virginia, and each is nine feet high and > six feet wide. These arches represent Description, Depiction and > Photography. The aforementioned tower contains a statue of Pan with the > traditional pipes, and he is either half drawing or sheathing a Roman sword. > Over a small turret on the opposite side of the tower is a gold vane of a > pen bending a sword. At various places on the monument are quotations > appropriate to the art of war correspondence. These are from a great variety > of sources beginning with Old Testament verses. Perhaps the most striking > feature of all are the tablets inscribed with the names of 157 > correspondents and war artists who saw and described in narrative and > picture almost all the events of the tour years of the war. This account errs in that \\"Speed\\" and \\"Heed\\" appear under the heads of Electricity and Poetry, and the \\"statue of Pan\\" is actually a zinc copy of Bertel Thorvaldsen's Mercury About to Kill Argos created by the J.W.

The monument's plaques lists 157 names which are sometimes assumed to be all war correspondents. In the late 1990s, local historian Timothy J. Reese analyzed the list and asserted that only 135 can claim to be war correspondents or artists, and 33 of those are not identifiable in the historical record. Furthermore, many names are misstated and several important names are missing.\\"War correspondents arch contains monumental errors\\", Associated Press, April 2, 1998, retrieved via Factiva; \\"The Truth About the War Memorial to Fallen Journalists\\", Timothy J.

He is best known for managing Democrat Gray Davis‚Äô successful gubernatorial campaigns in both 1998 and 2002. In 1998, the California Democratic Party had not been successful in electing a Governor for 20 years and only 3 Democrats had won previously in the 20th century.http://www.camajorityreport.com/index.php?module=roles&func;=display&uid;=89 http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/06/news/mn-31341 Garry South has been called the ‚ÄúCarville of California‚Äù by The New York Times and ‚Äúone of the top political strategists in the Democratic Party‚Äù by DailyKos.net. Newsweek described him as ‚Äúa one-man brain trust on the battlements of Fort California.‚Äù The National Journal described him ‚Äúshrewd and widely feared.‚Äù In 2011, the journal Capitol Weekly designated South among the top 50 most influential political players in California.  Early life  A native of Eastern Montana, South saw his father, Vernon, a carpenter, served on the Miles City, Montana City Council for years, a seat his older brother Carroll filled when Vernon retired. South ran his first successful campaign at age 23 in 1974, helping elect Carroll to the Montana House of Representatives. Carroll was the first Democratic legislator from the Souths' county in 20 years. South attended the University of Montana in Missoula, graduating with honors in 1976 with a BA in history and political science after serving as student body president. In 2008, South was named recipient of the University‚Äôs Distinguished Alumni Award. During his time at University of Montana, South supported long-shot former Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential primary. South worked to place Carter‚Äôs name on Montana‚Äôs primary ballot and, after Carter clinched the party nomination, South became state coordinator in Montana for the general election. At age 25, South served as the youngest state coordinator in the 50 states. Following his graduation and Carter‚Äôs successful presidential campaign, South worked as Midwest regional finance director of the Democratic National Committee and as special assistant to Secretary of Agriculture Bob Bergland. In 1978, the White House political office asked South to run the Democratic campaign in Illinois against Republican Sen. Charles H. Percy. His other political positions have included communications director for Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, vice president of political communications for the National Association of Realtors and public information director of the Montana Legislature. After Celeste was term-limited out of office in 1991, South moved to Southern California.  Gray Davis campaigns 1994-2003  Garry South, Gray Davis cartoon Soon after arriving in Southern California, South reengaged in politics and in 1994, managed Gray Davis‚Äô winning campaign for Lieutenant Governor of California. While 1994 was a historically poor election year for Democrats nationwide-- Republicans captured control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in decades and regained control of the Senate, Davis managed to capture more votes‚Äîaided by California‚Äôs large population‚Äîthan any other Democratic candidate in the country. During Davis‚Äô tenure as lieutenant governor, South served as Davis‚Äô chief of staff.  1998 California gubernatorial campaign  In 1998, South managed Gray Davis‚Äô run for Governor that, at many points, showed Davis trailing both of the other, well-financed Democrats in the primary and Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren in the general election. These frustrations led to many staff members leaving the campaign during the primary. Eventually, South helped guide Davis to win the primary and then a substantial victory in the general election. At the time, Davis was California‚Äôs first Democratic governor elected in 20 years. Davis later said ‚ÄúIt is entirely possible I would not have been elected governor without the strategic brilliance of Garry South.‚Äù The successful 1998 race shot South to prominence in California's political circles‚ÄîRepublican and Democratic alike. The California Journal credited South with ‚Äúone of the greatest resurrections in California political history,‚Äù and South was named Campaign Manager of the Year by the American Association of Political Consultants. The often critical Republican strategist Jonathan Wilcox wrote ‚Äúby any objective measure, the 1998 campaign that made Davis governor was brilliant, and South deserves credit. To gain the Democrats‚Äô nomination against better-funded opposition, South deftly used radio ads, secured endorsements (and used them meaningfully) and devised the slogan that tied it all together, ‚ÄôGray Davis: Experience Money Can‚Äôt Buy.‚Äô‚Äù  2002 California gubernatorial campaign  Governor Davis‚Äô most likely opponent in 2002 was moderate Republican and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. In an unorthodox move, South and the Davis campaign spent $10 million targeting Riordan during his three-way Republican primary fight. The Davis campaign highlighted Riordan‚Äôs moderate stances on abortion, guns, and other issues important to the conservative base he was trying to court for the primary. The controversial strategy worked and Riordan lost the primary to the more conservative Bill Simon Jr., 31.4% to 49.5%. Up against first-time candidate Simon Jr., a son of former Nixon and Ford Treasury Secretary William Simon, Davis cruised to victory, winning 47.3% to 42.4%. He was one of only two incumbent Democratic governors in the country that year to win reelection. Davis also is one of only three Democratic governors ever to win reelection to a four-year term in California‚Äôs 162-year history (the other two being Edmund ‚ÄúPat‚Äù Brown and his son, Jerry). Following Riordan‚Äôs loss in the Republican primary that year, the Los Angeles Times opined that South had ‚Äúoutmaneuvered the White House, which had encouraged Riordan to run, forcing the administration into a last-minute scramble.‚Äù Robin Fields of The Times concluded that ‚Äúin less than 10 years, South has rocketed from obscurity to stardom among the elite of political strategists in California and, thus, in the nation.‚Äù In a profile of South after the primary election, Newsweek called him a ‚Äúone-man brain trust on the battlements of Fort California‚Äù with a ‚Äúknack for foiling [Karl] Rove‚Äôs plans.‚Äù The August, 2012, edition the non- partisan National Journal designated the 2002 Davis campaign as one of the 10 best campaigns of the past 25 years, saying it was managed ‚Äúto perfection.‚Äù  2003 recall against Davis  South was not officially involved in the 2003 recall campaign against Gray Davis, as he was by then a senior advisor to presidential candidate Sen. Joe Lieberman. In 2001, however, South did respond to Arnold Schwarzenegger‚Äîwho was openly contemplating a 2002 run for governor against Davis‚Äîby faxing a ‚Äúfew dozen political reporters a then-current Premier magazine piece‚Äù alleging indiscretions in Schwarzenegger‚Äôs personal life. Schwarzenegger responded via his lawyer, threatening to sue South for libel. South and Schwarzenegger had exchanged other shots when Schwarzenegger was first considering a 2002 run, with South saying: \\"We'll be ready for him if he comes at us. We don't roll over and play dead for anybody, regardless of the size of his bankroll or biceps.\\" During Schwarzenegger‚Äôs governorship, South wrote several op-eds critical of his stewardship of the state and political moves. Among South‚Äôs critiques were that Schwarzenegger had ‚Äúpersonified the old saw ‚ÄúWhen your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail,‚Äù and that instead of lighting ‚Äúthe fires of imagination among California voters‚Ä¶ [Schwarzenegger] has become just another cog in the California Republican Ol‚Äô Boys‚Äô Network.‚Äù  Presidential campaigns 2000, 2004  In 2000, South was a top advisor to Al Gore's California presidential campaign, which carried the state by 12% and 1.3 million votes, and in which he met and became friends with Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential nominee. His efforts in the Gore race earned him the sobriquet ‚Äúa California Carville‚Äù in a profile by The New York Times. In 2003-04, South served as senior advisor to Lieberman in his 2004 presidential campaign. Upon the initial announcement that Lieberman had hired South, the liberal blog, DailyKos, reported ‚ÄúThe guy behind California's Gray Davis, and one of the top political strategists in the Democratic Party, has signed on with Lieberman.‚Äù  Ballot propositions  South‚Äôs political efforts included California‚Äôs robust proposition system. In 2000, South was lead strategist for the successful statewide school-bond-threshold measure, Prop. 39. South also advised the winning water and parks bond campaigns that year. In 2004, he was a strategist on the successful No on 67 campaign, working for a coalition of telecommunications providers, and the winning No on 68 campaign, a measure that would have allowed slot machines at race tracks and other venues.http://www.dailykos.net/archives/002984.html  Other campaigns  South served as senior advisor to the California Controller Steve Westly for governor primary campaign in 2005-06, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's 2010 bid for governor in 2008-09, which Newsom ended in October 2009, and as an advisor to U.S. Rep. Janice Hahn in her successful special-election congressional race in 2011.  Controversy  Despite working for progressive Democrats like Richard Celeste, Gavin Newsom and Janice Hahn, South has maintained a tense, if not sometimes biting, relationship with progressives in the liberal blogosphere. The criticisms range from his brash, fighting style‚Äîsometimes used against more liberal candidates‚Äîto his supposed call for moderating his candidates‚Äô stances in order to ‚Äútriangulate.‚Äù  UCLA archives and Other Recent Activities  In April 2012, South announced he was donating his entire collection of internal strategy memos, focus group tapes, polling data, TV spots and other campaign materials from the three campaigns he managed for Gray Davis to UCLA‚Äôs Library. The Garry South Political Campaigns Records, comprising 55 boxes of archives, said head UCLA Librarian Gary Strong, \\"gives tremendous insight into what goes on behind the scenes. The more we can demystify it, the more enlightening it will be for all of us.\\". Following a years-long decline for the California Republican Party in which they won no statewide offices in two out of three elections, and GOP voter registration dipped below 30% for the first time, newly elected state Chairman Jim Brulte invited South to speak to the party's board of directors in March 2013 and offer his diagnosis of their problems. \\"It's a pretty depressing presentation if you're a Republican,\\" South said. \\"So I may have a doctor on hand to issue Prozac prescriptions.\\" When asked why he would help the opposing party, South responded \\"I don't think it's helping them. It's the same presentation I've given to everybody from the dentists to the insurance agents.\\"http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2013/03/california- republicans-invite-democrat-garry-south-to-assess-state-of- gop.html#storylink=cpy References Category:Living people Category:Political consultants Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Garry South"},{"id":"37902458","text":"The Diccionari General de la Llengua Catalana by Pompeu Fabra is a Catalan dictionary, first published in fascicles in 1931. It was the Standard Catalan dictionary until 1995, when the Institut d'Estudis Catalans published its Diccionari de la llengua catalana.  History  The Institut d‚ÄôEstudis Catalans (IEC) wanted to create an inventory of the Catalan language and asked a small commission, directed by Pompeu Fabra, to do so. Fabra had published a spelling dictionary (Diccionari ortogr√†fic) in 1917 based on the official orthographic rules (Normes ortogr√†fiques), in addition to other works aiming to codify the Catalan language. Fabra created the dictionary during Primo de Rivera‚Äôs dictatorship (1923-1930). The work was initially published as installments in 1931. On November 30, 1932, the book was published by Llibreria Catal√≤nia. The second edition of the book was issued in 1954 (after the author‚Äôs death) and censored. Before 1994, 32 other editions of the book were published.  Description  Fabra used a scientific method for the dictionary, which was spontaneously recognized by the scientific community. Aiming for a modern and genuine language, he refused to include certain unused regional or archaic words. The sources of the work were, according to Fabra, other Catalan dictionaries, as well as the Dictionary of the Spanish Language', the Modem French Dictionary by Hatzfeld and Darmesteter, and the Webster‚Äôs Dictionary. Moreover, he took into consideration other lexical compendiums such as Diccionari Aguil√≥, Butllet√≠ de Dialectologia Catalana or other existing compendiums that were kept in the Institute‚Äôs lexicographical offices. He consulted with specialists so as to include some specific terminology and neologisms to the dictionary.  References  * Germ√† Colon i Amadeu-J.

Founders of Cruden have been developing professional motion simulators since the 1990s. Their expertise on designing simulators for aerospace industry leads them to transfer this knowledge to marine, automotive and motorsport industry. Simulator of Cruden is branded as Hexatech. Team of Cruden is formed of dynamists, software developers, mechanical engineers and project managers. Sales and service operations are located in Canada, Australia, Singapore and South Africa. Cruden supplies simulators to automotive industry, universities, research institutes, international motorsport companies and global attractions. Also the company produces simulator components and operation software, and plans to expand the production into motion-based rides. New headquarters is designed to house the manufacturing process of simulators including simulator components and developing new products. Such as, multiple guest interactivity simulator for attractions industry. The building houses all functional teams covering the mechanical design of Cruden components and systems. History Cruden B.V.‚Äôs heritage is in professional flight, marine and driving simulators. Originating from Fokker Aircraft Company, the company was previously known as FCS Racing Simulation and was renamed Cruden in 2006. In 2003, FCS took its flight simulation know-how and developed a racing simulator that combined a motion base with a detailed dynamic vehicle model, motion-cueing software and professional image generation. The resulting simulator proved to be very realistic according to University of Hertfordshire. Since 2005, the company started projects in the entertainment, industrial markets, Formula 1 teams. In 2009, Cruden decided to provide service to North American market by starting US operations. Product Main Characteristics of Hexatech Simulator *Driver and/or hardware in the loop simulation tool. *6 degrees of freedom *Compatible with Matlab/Simulink and integration of simulation models Vi- Grade, IPG CarMaker, veDYNA, CarSim and SIMPACK. *Vehicle characteristics can be modeled and changed: Wheelbase and track, tires, suspension settings, drive train (engine, gearbox, differentials) aerodynamic settings, steering, brakes and driver aids such as traction control, ABS and others. *Realistic steering feedback. *Image generation with reduced motion blur. *Real-time CG shadowing and environment mapping. *42\\" monitors or alternatively projectors on a curved screen to fully immerse the driver. *Seat belt tensioners. *Energy efficient electromechanical motion system consumes 5 kWh of electricity. *Steering systems with original steering wheel. *Original pedal boxes. *Projector systems (on and off-board). *Simulation Software and Content (Cars, tracks, public roads, racing circuit etc.) *Telemetry analyser, PiToolBox, MoTeC, Bosch Windarab and Magneti Marelli Windtax are the supported interfaces. Motorsports Cruden simulators are preferred by motorsport and Formula 1 teams. Companies prefer simulators to reduce their testing budget, try different vehicle settings in a shorter time frame. However, simulators are not only preferred in motorsport for time and budget concerns, the improvements in simulators also lead motorsport companies to focus on simulators. Such as, improved realism, accuracy, providing feedback, improved simulator algorithm. Motorsport simulator's image creation and simulator components are also provided by the company as well. This enables to create more realistic atmosphere for the driver inside the simulator. Simulator can be modified from the demands from the customers from hardware to exterior and interior design to provide experience that is more realistic. Gadget Show featured the simulator on 8 March 2010 (Season 13, Episode 6) by Jason Bradbury. He tried the simulator and tried to break lap record Holland‚Äôs Zandvoort Circuit in a Formula 1 car. The lap record was 1 minute 19 seconds and he achieved 1 minute 24.7 seconds. He mentioned that simulator was so realistic in terms of mental and physical effects. And also mentioned the technological features the simulator, which are mentioned previously. Automotive Cruden car simulator has the same principles as the motorsport simulators. The simulator for the automotive industry is built by the demands from the clients. Therefore, most of the automotive simulators are not the same and offer different types of simulation. Some of the simulators are embedded to a real car interior and users experience real life conditions during the simulation. Like motorsports simulator, automotive simulator is capable of transferring data to Telemetry. The simulator has the opportunity to engage electronic systems such as Bosch ESP and experience the influence on the driving. Moreover, different tire pressures and tire temperatures can be adjusted on the simulator. Mercedes-Benz used a Cruden simulator during the development of its C-Class to experience different suspension settings, shock absorbers, springs, seats, engine mounts and car structure. According to Mercedes-Benz, using simulator during the product development stage reduced costs, time and also enabled engineers to accurately identify the different settings on the vehicle. Mercedes-Benz also asked Cruden to develop a ride simulator for the international press to experience different ride settings as passenger during the launch for C-Class. This simulator accommodated two people in seated position. Education Cruden offers the simulator systems for education purposes. The simulator offers the same features like the other models and enables students to experience their theories and car models without facing high costs. Another important impact of using simulators in education is the development and improvement of human-machine interfaces. Engagement of simulators in education is also recognized by the academics and University of Hertfordshire School of Engineering and Technology offers a Cruden simulator for their students to experience and validate their cars models, it is available from the first year undergraduate students. The features and characteristics of this simulator is the same with other models and also it can be customized with the demands from customers. Attractions Ferrari World in Yas Island, Abu Dhabi features ten different simulators to experience Ferrari F1 cars and Ferrari models in Scuderia Challenge attraction. There are two Ferrari F1 simulators drive a F1 car around different circuits inside the simulator. According to Ferrari, these are the same simulators that are used to train their pilots The simulators are also available in Vortex Racing in Canada at Vortex Racing in Montreal (Lachine), I-WAY in Lyon, France and Grand Pier in North Somerset, UK. Moreover, simulators for attraction and entertainment are optimized for transportation, installment and consumption of space, these simulators size and mass is reduced by thirty-percentage to satisfy these needs. Moreover, different seat version can be applied like in other versions. Private Use The simulator can be purchased for private use. The features of the private use simulator are the same as the other versions. User can transfer information to simulator software and telemetry analyzer. Cars, tracks and any other settings can be changed according to owner‚Äôs needs.

He organized, in his house, the first Kri≈æevci house of prayer for the members of the community. On November 15, 1894, with presence of Kri≈æevci mayor Ferdo Vukiƒá, general assembly of the Jewish community talked and adopted the proposed development of the new synagogue. Architecture studio H√∂nigsberg & Deutsch was selected to build the new synagogue, and furniture company Bothe & Ehrmann to adapt the interior. Construction began on May 14, 1895 and four months later the synagogue was built on September 15, 1895 at the Strossmayer square. The consecration of the new synagogue and Torah transfer from old house of prayer took place on September 16, 1895. The synagogue was filled to its utmost capacity with a great crowd gathered outside. In 1941, during World War II, the Independent State of Croatia authorities have left synagogue robbed and devastated. Two torahs have been saved by Adela Weisz with the help from her non-Jewish friends, which are now located at the Jewish museum in Belgrade. After the war in 1945, the synagogue was taken by Kri≈æevci national committee. In agreement with the Federation of Jewish Communities of Yugoslavia, the synagogue served as a building for cultural events. Today, synagogue serves as a youth center. In November 2012, it was published that the synagogue will receive funds from the European Union for the thorough outside and inside restoration.

History One of the last of a large number of forts and fortified gun batteries built by the British Army primarily during the course of the 19th Century (many others had been built by the militia during the preceding centuries) to protect the British colony of Bermuda, and its Royal Naval Dockyard, the battery was completed in 1910. Whereas the batteries and forts built prior to this, all of which housed coastal artillery, were originally designed to be equipped with cannon, or rifled muzzle-loading guns (although some were later redesigned to house RBL guns), St. David's Battery was the first designed specifically for rifled breech loaders. The battery is equipped with two 9.2 inch Mk. X and two BL 6 inch Mk VII guns, on Central Pivot Mk II mount, all with 360 degrees of traverse, and all built by Vickers. The battery is sited on top of Great Head (the larger of the two heads that together make up St. David's Head), at the East end of the Island of St. David's, itself at the East end of the archipelago of Bermuda. Bermuda sits just inside the southern perimeter of a circular barrier reef (the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano). The reef parallels the South Shore at a distance of less than a quarter of a mile. To the North, it extends up to 18 miles from shore. There are no usable harbours on the South Shore, but large sheltered ones accessible from the lagoon within the reef to the North. This lagoon, however, can only be accessed by large vessels via a channel through the reefs which brings them near to the Eastern coast of St. David's Island. Passing St. David's, vessels can either enter into St. George's Harbour, or continue Northward, rounding the East end of St. George's Island, following through another channel that leads to the West, into the waters of the lagoon, from where they can reach the Great Sound, Hamilton Harbour, the Royal Naval Dockyard, and Murray's Anchorage. Following US independence, the Royal Navy had built up a large naval base in Bermuda, including the dockyard, an Admiralty House, and various subsidiary facilities. This became the headquarters of the North America and West Indies Squadron, and the primary Royal Naval base in the Western Atlantic (although a base in Brazil served South Atlantic waters). Protecting this base was the primary reason for the British Army's large garrison in Bermuda, with its numerous forts and batteries. Of all of these, St. David's Head occupied the most decisive position, watching over the bottle-neck through which any force large enough to conceivably seize the archipelago would have to travel (although smaller vessels might pick through the reefs to land raiding parties or saboteurs elsewhere).

During both world wars, St. David's Battery was designated as the \\"examination battery\\" for Bermuda. An officer of the Royal Navy Examination Service was taken out to meet ships arriving off Bermuda, along with the pilot who would steer the vessel through the reef. The ships were stopped under the watchful eyes of the gunners at St. David's Head. In that position, the naval officer had the task of examining the vessel and its documents before it was allowed to proceed inwards to the lagoon, or any of the harbours. It would not be long before the battery fired its first shot during the Great War. The British competitor for the 1914 America's Cup, Shamrock IV, was crossing the Atlantic with the steam yacht Erin, destined for Bermuda, when Britain declared war on Germany on 5 August 1914. Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, the Commodore of the New York Yacht Club, sent his own yacht, named Vagrant, from Rhode Island to Bermuda to meet them and escort them to the US. The British crews had received word of the declaration by radio. Among the first things done in Bermuda on the declaration was to remove all maritime navigational aids. Vagrant arrived on the 8th. Having no radio, the crew were unaware of the declaration of war. Finding all of the buoys and other navigational aids missing, they attempted to pick their own way in through the Narrows, the channel that threads through the barrier reef. This took them directly to the fore of St. David's Battery, where the gunners were on a war footing and opened fire. This was just a warning shot, which had the desired effect. Shamrock IV and Erin arrived the next day. The America's Cup was cancelled for that year. The Shamrock IV and Erin proceeded to New York, where the racer was laid up 'til 1920. The Erin returned to Britain. Most of the crew were members of the Royal Navy Reserve, who had been called up for full-time service. Initially, the battery was manned by full-time gunners of the Royal Garrison Artillery, supported by a part-time reserve, the Bermuda Militia Artillery. Following the First World War, the regular gunners were steadily reduced, until the BMA took over complete responsibility for maintaining and operating the colony's coastal artillery (although search lights at the battery, used for night-time firing, were operated by the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers).Hind, Jennifer BMA History\\"The Bermuda Volunteer Engineers\\", by Jennifer Hind, author of \\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the BVRC\\". 6 inch Breech Loading (BL) guns, with the two 9.2 inch BLs visible beyond, and the barracks to the right, in 2011 St. David's Battery in 1942 Rear view of the magazine for the two 9.2 inch guns (visible atop) in 2011 The Search Light Direction Station, built into the cliff face at St. David's Battery, communicated with the Search Light Emplacement to direct the beam of the Defence Electric Light The Search Light Emplacement that housed the Defence Electric Light at St. David's Battery In 1936, on the occasion of the death of King George V, the St. David's Battery was involved in what could have been a severe international incident. The BMA had been instructed to fire a memorial salute from one of the two 4.7 inch guns at Saint David's Battery. This salute was to consist of seventy blank rounds, one for each year of the King's life, fired at one-minute intervals. Because of the difficulty of storing ammunition in Bermuda's humid climate, there proved to be only twenty- three rounds of blank ammunition in stock, and the remainder used were all headed ammunition. As the firing was to commence at 8am (on 21 January), and it was thought unlikely any vessels would be in the danger area, it was decided to proceed with the salute, ensuring the guns were elevated for maximum range (8,000 yards), out to sea. The firing began at 08:00, and was over seventy minutes later. What the BMA gunners were unaware of, however, was that the Colombian Navy destroyer ARC Antioquia, was at the receiving end of their barrage. The British-built destroyer was under the command of a retired Royal Naval officer (part of the British Naval Mission to Colombia), and was arriving at Bermuda to undergo repairs at the HM Dockyard. Although the ship's crew members were alarmed to find themselves on the receiving end of an artillery barrage, the ship fortunately was not hit. By the Second World War, St. David's Battery was the only one left in service, and only the two 6 inch guns remained in active use. Although another battery, with two 6 inch guns, was built at Warwick Camp, it remained the primary coastal artillery battery until the arrival of US Army artillery batteries in 1942. The guns were emplaced so that they were difficult, at any great distance, to discern from the slope which fell gently to the top of the cliffs before them. Other than the guns, the only other parts of the battery in direct sight from enemy vessels were two small buildings perched on the edge of the cliff as it lowers towards the water on the northern side of the 6 inch battery (these being the Search Light Emplacement and the Search Light Direction Building), although these would have been difficult to spy (at least, as long as the search light was not operating). On the southern side, and a short distance to the rear, of the No. 1 9.2 inch gun is a raised concrete platform for a Depression Range Finder. Beneath the guns were extensive magazines, which fed ammunition up to the firing parties by conveyor belt-like lifts. The magazines below the 6 inch guns were placed completely below ground, as a slope (surfaced to form a water catchment) rises to the back of the gun positions. The magazines of the 9 inch guns, however, opened to a courtyard to the rear. A short distance behind the battery was a barracks and a small parade ground. Behind these, on Skinner's Hill, was the Fire Commanders Post, which gave orders for gun-laying, the Position Finder Cell and Marine Signals. In 1953, the last Imperial Defence Plan was issued, under which the local units were tasked. The decision had been taken in 1951 to close the dockyard, other than a small supply base (HMS Malabar); a process which stretched from 1951 to 1958. As a result, the last regular soldiers (a company of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry) were to be withdrawn in 1957, and the last coastal artillery, the two 6 inch guns of St. David's Battery, removed from use immediately. The BMA retasked as an infantry unit, although it remained nominally part of the Royal Artillery. Today, St. David's Battery is intact, but derelict. The two 9.2 inch and the two 6 inch guns remain emplaced, but have been allowed to suffer considerable corrosion damage. The two 6 inch guns, which had originally been emplaced without any kind of gun shield, had been retrofitted later with box-shaped armour shields, providing protection from the front, the sides, and above. Intact in the early 1990s, these barbettes had subsequently suffered such damage that they were removed. The area is currently public parkland (Great Head Park), and the Park Service has made some repairs, and painted the guns to protect them from further corrosion. The breech blocks of the two 9.2 inch guns have been replaced with newly manufactured ones. The barracks and other buildings to the rear of the battery are currently used by a kindergarten school and for private accommodation. A number of apartment buildings have been built around them, and on the hillside dropping down to the North of the battery. Although the magazines are locked, the guns of the battery can be visited by the general public without restriction or cost.

Business context At the time the PEG acquires the platform, they do not have an existing compatible company to combine it with that would yield synergies. Platform companies stand in contrast to ‚Äúadd-on‚Äù or ‚Äútuck-in‚Äù acquisitions, where synergies to an existing portfolio company exist. Estimates vary across sources, but add-ons constitute roughly 40-50% of PE buyout activity, making it critical for business owners who are thinking of taking a private equity investment to understand some of the strategic implications of both views. Add-on and tuck- in acquisitions are usually marketed by Boutique investment bank and considerably smaller companies so as to not dilute the culture of the platform. In academia, Platform companies are those that involve not only one company's technology or service but also an ecosystem of complements to it that are usually produced by a variety of businesses. As a result, becoming a platform leader requires different business and technology strategies than those needed to launch a successful stand-alone product.  Fundamental approaches  Platform leadership is typically built with one of two fundamental approaches: \\"coring\\"; and \\"tipping\\". \\"Coring\\" is using a set of techniques to create a platform by making a technology \\"core\\" to a particular technological system and market. When pursuing a coring strategy, would-be platform leaders think about issues such as how to make it easy for third parties to provide add-ons to the technology and how to encourage third-party companies to create complementary innovations. Examples of successful coring include Google Inc. in Internet search and Qualcomm Inc. in wireless technology. \\"Tipping\\" is the set of activities that helps a company \\"tip\\" a market toward its platform rather than some other potential one. Examples of tipping include Linux's growth in the market for Web server operating systems. Another tipping strategy is for a company to bundle features from an adjacent market into its existing platform. This is referred to as \\"tipping across markets\\". In common use of the term, platform companies are those of sufficient size and talent, and with enough talent management and succession planning capabilities, to support add add-on or tuck-in acquisitions. PEGs seek to acquire companies that they can grow or improve (or both) with a view toward eventual sale or public offering. In terms of growth, the financial sponsor usually acquires a platform company in a particular industry and then tries to add additional companies to the platform through acquisition. These add-ons may be competitors of the original platform company, or may be businesses with some link to it, but they are added with the goal of increasing overall revenues and earnings of the platform investment.  Strategic planning  PEGs spend much time developing strategic plans and an investment case for a new platform to determine why they are buying a business and how to generate an attractive return. This analysis is usually even more comprehensive for businesses that are new to a PEG. For add-on acquisitions, PEGs sometimes lean more on the expertise of its relevant portfolio company's management to determine the fit, synergies and strategic benefits of a transaction. For new platforms, PEGs view each transaction as stand-alone. There are no synergies, there is only a transaction with an investment rationale on how to grow the business and generate a targeted return. That rationale is the driver behind the deal, and it defines how the PEG creates value through things like capital infusions, operating partners and even future add-on acquisitions. As a result, the strategy behind the deal is more open-ended. The PEG has a greater degree of operating flexibility and seeks more avenues of growth to maximize the probability of a successful investment. For new platforms, PEGs require that the company not only be self-sustaining, but be scalable. The ability to grow the company is the rationale behind the deal. The PEG seeks avenues of growth to maximize value of the investment. For new platforms, PEGs focus on issues including industry attractiveness, the opportunities for growth, the self-sufficiency and scalability of the target, and whether the PEG can add value in the acquisitions process. To be self- sufficient and scalable, the target must be able to prosper without any one individual. Customers must be ‚Äúowned‚Äô by the company, not one person, and certainly not the current owner. Critical processes must be mapped, and the organization must be in a highly efficient.

The gunman, 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts, ran into the shopping center black clothing and a \\"Jason Vorhees\\" mask and sporadically opening fire using a Stag Arms AR-15 rifle taken without permission from a friend. He fired a total of 17 shots, killing two people and seriously wounding a third.Many shots were ricochets. Having attempted to reload his weapon and dropping three magazines, Roberts entered an employee only back stairwell that runs behind all stores in the mall and committed suicide after descending one level. He had no connection to any of his victims, and it was believed to be a senseless and random act of violence. The Clackamas Town Center has a posted policy of prohibiting any firearms on the premises.Code of Conduct Details Prior to the shooting 1973 AR-15, one of many models of the semi-automatic rifle used by the shooter Sometime prior to the shooting, Roberts is stated to have stolen a Stag Arms STAG-15 AR-15-style rifle from an acquaintance. Immediately before the shooting, he visited a friend who lived two miles away from the Clackamas Town Center, smoked marijuana with him, and claimed that he was moving to Hawaii. He drove to the mall sometime later and parked at the south side between Macy's and Chipotle Mexican Grill. He ran into the mall through Macy's department store at 3:28 p.m., wearing a white \\"Jason Vorhees\\" mask and dressed in a black sweater and black pants. He was armed with the AR-15. He was also carrying five loaded magazines, one of which he accidentally dropped in the parking lot while entering the mall. Roberts legally bought four additional standard capacity 30-round ammunition magazines and the ammunition to fill them at three local stores, including a Walmart, The Gunbroker, and Wholesale Sports Outdoor Outfitters. When he stole the unsecured AR-15 from a friend, it was loaded with a standard capacity 30-round ammunition magazine. Between 8,000 and 10,000 people were inside the mall at the time. People who first saw him run into the mall believed the tactical clothing and hockey mask were a paintball outfit and that the rifle was a toy.\\"Clackamas Town Center shooting: 22 minutes of chaos and terror as a gunman meanders through the mall\\" Shooting Standing in a large atrium, Roberts first opened fire at the mall's food court that was across from him at his left. The first person shot was 54-year-old shopper Cindy Ann Yuille, a hospice nurse and mother of two who was shot in the back; she died despite efforts of bystanders to treat her wound. 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, who was walking through the mall with her friend to reach the Town Center MAX station, was the second person to be shot; she received a bullet to the chest, but she survived and made it out of the mall, where she was treated for her gunshot wound. The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, who was sitting by a rented kiosk and talking with his father on his cell phone when he was shot in the head and killed. At this point, hundreds of people fled the mall after hearing the gunshots, but many remained inside and dashed to cover. Roberts headed further toward the food court, firing at 16-year-old employee Alina Pavlenko, who was over 100 feet away, but missed. He also dropped three other magazines in his possession. He then turned back and headed toward a JCPenney store. He attempted to reload the AR-15 at that point, but was unable to do so, the weapon having apparently jammed. During that time, Nick Meli, a concealed carry permit holder, drew his Glock 22, claimed to have taken aim at Roberts, but did not fire since there was a bystander behind Roberts. Meli claims that Roberts saw him and that this may have contributed to Roberts' decision to commit suicide. Shooting ends Roberts then ran into a back storage corridor, where he encountered employee Rok Sang Kim, who had returned from recycling boxes and therefore hadn't heard the gunfire. Roberts pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot him, instead running down a flight of stairs onto a lower floor. There, he committed suicide at 3:50 p.m. In the chaos of the first few minutes after the shooting, there were expectations of mass casualties. Police responded to the scene minutes later and spent the following hours searching the mall for hiding civilians, injured victims, and a possible second shooter, while dozens of ambulances arrived with the expectations of treating dozens of wounded victims, but treated only Kristina Shevchenko for a serious gunshot wound. Roberts fired only seventeen rounds during the entire shooting, including the one to kill himself. An additional 128 rounds were found in the magazines he dropped and on his person. By the next day, the mall was cleared of civilians, but continued to remain under lock-down. It is believed Roberts targeted random people and did not have a specific target in mind. Victims Two people were killed in the shooting, 54-year-old Cindy Ann Yuille and 45-year-old Steven Forsyth. A third person, 15-year-old Kristina Shevchenko, was shot in the side of the chest and seriously injured, but survived. Several others also suffered minor bruises and scrapes suffered while fleeing. Perpetrator Jacob Tyler Roberts (March 16, 1990 ‚Äì December 11, 2012) was identified as the sole perpetrator of the shooting. He lived in the Lents neighborhood in southeast Portland. Roberts was raised by his aunt Tami Roberts; his biological mother, Teresa Anne Roberts, died from cancer in February 1993, shortly before his third birthday. Court records and family indicated that the identity of his father is unknown. He had been estranged from his aunt Tami Roberts since the time he was 18 years of age, though the aunt declined to comment on the reason, saying only that it was unrelated to an $18,000 inheritance from Roberts's grandmother that court documents allegedly show Tami Roberts misappropriated. He attended Milwaukie High School in Milwaukie, Oregon for the first three years and later transferred during his senior year to Oregon City High School in Oregon City, Oregon, graduating in 2008. He attended Clackamas Community College in 2009. Prior to the shooting, Roberts worked at the popular Portland gyro restaurant,\\"Big Bertha's\\" on S.E. Hawthorne Blvd., a popular late night eatery in the infamous \\"Barmuda Triangle\\" known for 6 hard pouring bars within a two block radius. He was loved by his employer, as well as many friends. Roberts lived with a few roommates in a house ten minutes away from the shopping center. He had plans of joining the United States Marine Corps, but he abandoned these dreams after a bicycle accident that broke his foot. Over the month prior to the shooting Jacob sold had slowly sold his belongings, including a legal handgun, resigned from his job at the gyro shop, and told his friends and colleagues that he was planning to move to Hawaii. He told several friends the Friday before the shooting he had missed his flight and told them he had rebooted it. He also purchased at least four magazines and hundreds of rounds of ammunition from local stores during that same timeline. Reaction When President Barack Obama delivered a speech regarding the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, he mentioned other shooting rampages that occurred in the U.S. within previous months, including the incident at the Clackamas Town Center. On March 28, 2013, a candlelight vigil was held at the mall, organized against gun violence and one of more than 120 events held nationwide to commemorate the National Day of Action to Reduce Gun Violence.\\"Candlelight vigil against gun violence to be held tonight at Clackamas Town Center\\" References Category:2012 in Oregon Category:2012 mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:2012 murders in the United States Category:Attacks in the United States in 2012 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in the United States Category:Clackamas County, Oregon Category:Crimes in Oregon Category:Deaths by firearm in Oregon Category:Defensive gun use Category:Mass shootings in Oregon Category:Murder in Oregon Category:Murder‚Äìsuicides in Oregon Category:Shopping mall attacks Category:Suicides by firearm in Oregon ","title":"Clackamas Town Center shooting"},{"id":"37903141","text":"James Rogers (born May 27, 1988) is a former American football cornerback.

Early life Ben Pappas was born in Melbourne, Australia to Bill and Kerry Pappas (nee Bardot) and he and his older brother Tasou Micah \\"Tas\\" Pappas were raised in the Melbourne suburb of St Albans.

The brothers soon won sponsorship from Hardcore with clothing and skateboards provided in return for demos at shopping centres. In 1994, Ben Pappas placed sixth in the New Jersey demo. He participated in the Slam City Jam in Vancouver in 1995 and placed ninth in the event in 1997. In 1999, he placed fifth in the Mountain Dew U.S. Open, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1996, he was ranked the #2 skateboarder in the world while his brother Tas was #1. The two quickly earned a reputation for their confrontational behaviour and partying. Around this time, both began using cocaine. In 1999, Pappas was arrested for attempting to smuggle 103 grams of cocaine into Australia in the sole of a skate shoe. As a result of the conviction, he was banned from traveling internationally for three years and his passport was seized. The conviction effectively ended his pro skateboarding career as he was no longer able to travel for competitions. Later years After Pappas' career ended, he remained in Australia. He married in 1999, but the marriage ended in divorce after two years. For the next several years, he lived a transient lifestyle staying with friends and family. According to his older brother Tas, Pappas had become depressed and frustrated over his career ending and began using heroin. From May to September 2006, he was treated for anxiety and depression. In March 2005, Pappas began dating Lynette Phillips, a recovering drug addict who was studying to be a drug counselor at Swinburne University. The two moved in together but the relationship was tumultuous and violent as Pappas was reportedly physically abusive and controlling. The two broke up several times. In February 2006, Phillips was granted an interim intervention order against Pappas after he physically assaulted her and damaged her property. The order was revoked the following month at Phillips' request after the two reconciled. At the time of Pappas' death, he and Phillips had reportedly broken up again. Death On 24 February 2007, Pappas' on-off girlfriend Lynette Phillips disappeared. On 2 March, her body was found wrapped in a quilt in Dights Falls on the Yarra River. She had been weighted down with a backpack containing two four kilogram dumbbells. An autopsy determined that Phillips had been strangled. Pappas became the sole suspect as he was the last person seen with Phillips before her body was discovered, and the quilt and dumbbells found on Phillips' body belonged to Pappas. Police issued a statewide bulletin to locate Pappas for questioning. On 3 March, Pappas admitted himself to the emergency room at The Alfred Hospital where he told staff that he was experiencing suicidal thoughts. After a few hours, Pappas told staff that the thoughts had subsided and he was released. He returned to the home of a friend with whom he had been staying. The following day, the friend with whom Pappas' was staying said he told Pappas about the discovery of Phillips' body. According to the friend, Pappas indicated he had already learned of Phillips' death through another friend. The two later had a conversation in which Pappas said he could not remember what happened the day of Phillips' death (24 February) and only recalled waking up on a bench and then taking a large quantity of Xanax. Later that evening, Pappas left his friend's home and was never heard from again. Six days later, on 10 March, his body was found floating under the pier of the Victoria Dock. In 2012, a coroner's inquest determined that Pappas killed Lynette Phillips and had drowned himself after her body was found. A psychologist who treated Pappas before his death noted that he had shown signs of \\"suicidal ideation, homicidal tendencies, and psychotic-related symptoms such as paranoia, anger and frustration.\\" Film In 2011, the Pappas family and close friends launched a Facebook campaign to stop production of a documentary funded by Film Victoria with the working title Gnarly: The Ben Pappas Story. Pappas' friends and family said they wanted to stop production on the film as they did \\"not want to see Ben's life story sensationalized in this exploitative manor [sic]\\". Mike Hall, the film's producer, abandoned the project in October 2011.

In the years following the Civil War, the West Virginia legislature was dominated by the Radical Republicans. By 1869, Liberal Republicans were being elected to the legislature in significant numbers. The amendment, named for William H.H. Flick, a newly elected Liberal Republican, was intended to limit the growth of the Democratic Party in the legislature by appealing to African-Americans and conservative-leaning Democrats. The amendment, however, had unintentional consequences for the Republican party. The 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which granted in 1870 the right to vote regardless of skin color, had been ratified more quickly than proponent of the Flick Amendment had anticipated, nullifying its appeal to African-Americans. The provisions of the Flick Amendment were incorporated into the West Virginia Constitution of 1872. Republicans had hoped the amendment would unite the Republicans and fragment the Democratic party. The opposite occurred, however, and the newly enfranchised Democratic Party‚Äîpropelled by reinstated ex-Confederate voters, dominated state politics for the next quarter-century.

He played college football at Wisconsin and was drafted 31st overall by the Cowboys in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft. In his time as a Cowboy he was elected to 5 Pro Bowls and he was an All-Pro in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Early years A native of Sharon, Wisconsin, Frederick attended Big Foot High School in Walworth, Wisconsin, where he was an all-state two-way lineman. He helped his high school team to second place in the 2008 WIAA Division 4 state playoffs. Frederick was also on Big Foot's track team. He finished second in the shot put at the 2008 'BDN' Invite, with a throw of . He took silver second in the discus throw at the 2008 WIAA Sectional Championships, with a throw of . Recruiting Regarded as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Frederick was ranked as the No. 83 offensive tackle prospect in his class. College career Frederick attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and played for the Wisconsin Badgers football team from 2009 to 2012. After graduating high school early to participate in spring practice, Frederick became the first true freshman in Badgers history to start a season-opening game on the offensive line, when he lined up at center against Northern Illinois. An ankle injury in week 2 knocked him out of the starting lineup, but he returned for the final two games, at left guard, after center Peter Konz was sidelined (blood clots) and John Moffitt was moved to center. For the season, he played in five games, starting four (two at center and two at left guard). In order to preserve a year of Frederick's NCAA eligibility, Wisconsin coaching staff decided to redshirt him in 2010. In his redshirt sophomore season, Frederick replaced John Moffitt, starting 11 of 13 games at left guard. For two games, he had to substitute for Peter Konz at center. Following Konz's departure for the 2012 NFL Draft, Frederick was moved to center his junior season. He started all 13 games at center and was named a first-team All-American by Pro Football Weekly. Professional career 2013 NFL Draft Considered the best center in his class by Mel Kiper Jr. of ESPN, Frederick decided to enter the 2013 NFL Draft as an underclassman. He was projected to be a second- to third-round selection. At the NFL Combine, Frederick ran a 5.58 in the 40-yard dash, second-slowest among offensive lineman. He also posted a below-average 21 repetitions in the 225 lb bench press. Dallas Cowboys Frederick snapping the football to Dak Prescott in 2017 In the 2013 NFL Draft, the Dallas Cowboys traded down in the first round with the San Francisco 49ers in exchange for a third-round pick (used to draft Terrance Williams). In the first round, the team selected Frederick after eight offensive linemen were drafted before him. This decision caused a stir in the media because it was not only seen as a reach, but the trade was also criticized for bringing poor compensation after moving down 13 positions. Frederick was named a starter from the first day of Organized Team Activities in the preseason, replacing Phil Costa, who had been the starter in the previous two years. He became the first rookie in franchise history to start every game at center and was selected to the NFL All-Rookie team. 2014 The next year, he continued his development, by anchoring what was arguably considered as the best offensive line in the league and was also named to his first Pro Bowl. 2015 In 2015, he had to work with four different starting quarterbacks with varying degrees of knowledge of the team's offense, which required him to make more protection calls. He was named to his second Pro Bowl. 2016 On August 13, 2016, Frederick signed a six-year, $56.4 million contract extension with the Cowboys, making him the highest-paid center in the league. Before the start of the 2016 season, Frederick was named one of the five team captains. That year, Frederick helped pave the way for rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott to the NFL rushing yards leader and his first Pro Bowl while protecting rookie quarterback Dak Prescott to his first Pro Bowl as well. He was named to his third straight Pro Bowl and was named First-team All-Pro, both honors being shared with fellow Cowboy offensive linemen Tyron Smith and Zack Martin. He was also ranked 87th on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 as the only center in the list. 2017 On December 19, 2017, Frederick was named to his fourth straight Pro Bowl alongside tackle Tyron Smith and guard Zack Martin for the second straight year. 2018 On September 3, 2018, Frederick was not placed on injured reserve to start the 2018 season after being diagnosed with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome on August 22. He was inactive for the first four games before inevitably being placed on the reserve/non-football illness list on October 6, 2018. 2019 Frederick was named to his fifth Pro Bowl.  Retirement  On March 23, 2020, Frederick announced his retirement from professional football. Personal life Frederick double majored in computer engineering and computer science at the University of Wisconsin. On August 22, 2018, Frederick was diagnosed with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome.

He fought at the battles of Stoke and Flodden. Richard Neville was the eldest son of Sir Henry Neville, who was killed on 26 July 1469 at the Battle of Edgecote Moor, and Joan Bourchier (d. 7 October 1470), daughter of John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, by Margery, daughter and heiress of Richard Berners, esquire. He had a brother, Thomas Neville, and a sister, Joan Neville, wife of Sir James Radcliffe.. Neville's maternal grandfather, John Bourchier, 1st Baron Berners, was the fourth son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu in Normandy, and his wife Anne of Gloucester, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of King Edward III. By her second husband, Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford, Anne of Gloucester was the mother of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham.. On his father's side, Richard Neville was the grandson of George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer (d. 30 or 31 December 1469), and Elizabeth Beauchamp, the daughter of Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick.. Career When he was only a year old, Richard Neville inherited the barony together with lands in 24 counties, including Snape Castle in Richmondshire, at the death of his grandfather, George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer, on 30 or 31 December 1469. His wardship and marriage were purchased for ¬£1000 in May 1470 by his great uncle, Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, while his lands remained in the hands of the crown. He was made a Knight of the Bath on 17 January 1478.; . Neville had livery of his lands without proof of age on 8 May 1491. From 12 August of that year until 3 November 1529 he was summoned to Parliament by writs directed to 'Ricardo Nevill de Latimer chivaler'. However, in about 1494 his inheritance was contested by Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke, who although summoned to the 1491 Parliament by writs directed to 'Roberto Willughby de Broke chivaler', nonetheless claimed that he was entitled to the Latimer barony and lands through his great-grandmother's brother, John Willoughby. Neville ultimately prevailed, and a herald recorded that 'the Lord Brooke had made a wrong claim'.; . Neville's father-in-law, Sir Humphrey Stafford (c.1426/7 - 8 July 1486) of Grafton, Worcestershire, was a staunch supporter of King Richard III. After Richard's defeat at Bosworth, Stafford and Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell, fled to sanctuary at Colchester. In April 1486 they attempted to stir up rebellion against the new King, Henry VII, with Stafford trying to raise forces in the West Midlands, and Lovell in Yorkshire. When the rebellion collapsed, on 11 May 1486 Stafford again fled to sanctuary, this time at Culham, but was not allowed to claim the privilege, and for his part in the insurrection was executed at Tyburn on 8 July 1486.; ; . In contrast, Neville appears to have supported the new regime. According to Ford, Neville's strengths were 'loyalty to the crown and military service'. On 16 June 1487 he fought at the Battle of Stoke with Henry VII's forces which put down the rising of the pretender, Lambert Simnel. He served with the army in the north after the Earl of Northumberland was assassinated in 1489, and was with the King's forces in Brittany in 1492. In 1499 he attended the trial of the pretender, Perkin Warbeck. In 1513 he was with the Earl of Surrey at the Battle of Flodden, where he fought in the vanguard. In September 1522 the Earl of Shrewsbury consulted him regarding war against the Duke of Albany.; ; . Neville also served in non-military capacities. He was appointed to a number of commissions, and is recorded as being in attendance at festivities at court in 1488 and 1499. In 1503 he was among those who escorted King Henry VII's daughter, Margaret Tudor, between Tadcaster and York on her journey to Scotland to wed James IV. In November 1515 he was among those present at Westminster Abbey when Thomas Wolsey was made Cardinal.. On 13 July 1530 Neville was one of the signatories to the letter petitioning Pope Clement VII to grant Henry VIII a divorce from Catherine of Aragon.

It can be used from any operating system. Diff- Text was developed by DiffEngineX LLC and uses improved algorithms originally developed for the spreadsheet compare tool DiffEngineX It allows the user to choose between comparing at the level of whole lines (or paragraphs), words or characters. If comparing whole lines only the fact that a line is not in the other block will be reported. Diff Text considers a paragraph to be any line ending with a Windows, Macintosh or Unix line terminator. The website can combine the original and modified text blocks into one pane with all differences highlighted. Alternatively the marked-up original and modified text blocks can be displayed in individual panes. Navigation from one difference to the next is supported. All of the above features are not unique and can be found in other text comparison tools. The software can display just the differences, the differences with a variable amount of context on either side or the whole marked-up text.

Limitations Of Using The Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm The unique feature of Diff-Text is its ability to spot text that has either been moved up or down in the document and placed into a new context. To avoid spurious similarities being flagged, the software allows the user to specify the minimum number of adjacent words or characters to be reported as a move. Text movements are reported such that the number of individual edits to transform the original text into the modified text are at a minimum. The vast majority of text comparison software based on the longest common subsequence problem algorithm incorrectly report moved text as unlinked additions and deletions. The algorithm only reports the longest in-order run of text between two documents. Text moved out of the longest run of similarities is missed. Heuristics are not used. Any similarity between the two documents above the specified minimum will be reported (if detecting moves is selected). This is the main difference between Diff Text and most other text comparison algorithms. Diff Text will always match up significant similarities even if contained within non-identical or moved lines. It never resorts to guessing or the first match that happens to be found, which may result in non-optimal matches elsewhere. Not only can Diff-Text spot whole paragraphs that have been moved up or down in a document, it can spot sentence re-ordering within a paragraph. To indicate this the background color of the text changes to light blue and yellow. If the user specifies text movements should not be detected, its algorithm runs in (m log n) time, which is an improvement from the standard quadratic time often seen in software of this type. m and n refer to the sizes of the original and modified texts. Summary Conventional text comparison tools based on the longest common subsequence problem algorithm can potentially miss a lot of similarities between original and modified files, if blocks of text are moved around. Diff-Text is systematic and allows the user to specify the minimum number of contiguous words or characters to be considered a valid move.

An AR-15 style rifle is a lightweight semi-automatic rifle based on the ArmaLite AR-15 design, which is itself a scaled-down derivative of Eugene Stoner's AR-10 design. ArmaLite sold the patent and trademarks to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959. After Colt's patents expired in 1977, Colt retained the trademark and is the exclusive owner of the \\"AR-15\\" designation. The Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act restricted the Colt AR-15 and some derivatives from 1994 to 2004, although it did not affect rifles with fewer features. After the term modern sporting rifles was coined in 2009 by the US National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry trade association, it was quickly adopted by the trade association and some manufacturers. An expanded marketplace emerged with many manufacturers producing their own version of the AR-15 design for commercial sale. In the 2010s, AR-15 style rifles became one of the \\"most beloved and most vilified rifles\\" in the United States, according to The New York Times. The rifle has been promoted as \\"America's rifle\\" by the National Rifle Association. Its steadily increasing popularity is in part due to \\"the amount of attention through politics and media that is devoted to banning or restricting AR pattern rifles\\", and additionally because of the large number of styles and variants being produced by many different manufacturers. The rifles are controversial in part due to their use in mass shootings. Terminology The Colt AR-15 is closely related to the military M16 and M4 Carbine rifles, which all share the same core design and have the same operating principle. The term \\"AR-15\\" is now most-commonly used to refer only to the civilian variants of the rifle which lack the fully automatic function. Colt AR-15 SP1 rifle with 'slab side' lower receiver (lacking raised boss around magazine release button) and original Colt 20-round box magazine In 1956, ArmaLite designed a lightweight selective fire rifle for military use and designated it the ArmaLite Rifle model 15, or AR-15. Due to financial problems and limitations in terms of manpower and production capacity, ArmaLite sold the design and the AR-15 trademark along with the ArmaLite AR-10 to Colt's Manufacturing Company in 1959. In 1964, Colt began selling its own version with an improved semi- automatic design known as the Colt AR-15. After Colt's patents expired in 1977, an active marketplace emerged for other manufacturers to produce and sell their own semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles. Some versions of the AR-15 were classified as \\"assault weapons\\" and banned under the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act in 1994 within the United States. This act expired in 2004. In 2009, the term \\"modern sporting rifle\\" was coined by the National Shooting Sports Foundation for its survey that year as a marketing term used by the firearms industry to describe modular semi- automatic rifles including AR-15s. Today, nearly every major firearm manufacturer produces its own generic AR-15 style rifle. As Colt continues to own and use the AR-15 trademark for its line of AR-15 variants, other manufacturers must use their own model numbers and names to market their AR-15 style rifles for commercial sale.  Modularity  While most earlier breech- loading rifles had a single receiver housing both the trigger and reloading mechanism, an innovative feature of the AR-15 was modular construction to simplify substitution of parts and avoid need for arsenal facilities for most repairs of malfunctioning military rifles. A distinctive two-part receiver is used by both military and sporting AR-15 style rifles. As civilian ownership of AR-15 style rifles became sufficient to create a market for improvements, numerous manufacturers began producing one or more \\"improved\\" modules, assemblies, or parts with features not found on factory rifles, and individuals with average mechanical aptitude can often substitute these pieces for original equipment. Due to the vast assortment of aftermarket parts and accessories available, AR-15 style rifles have also been referred to as \\"the Swiss Army knife of rifles,\\"Patrick Sweeney ARS Across the Board . GUNS&AMMO; November 2010 \\"Barbie Dolls for Guys,\\" or \\"LEGOs for adults\\". These more or less interchangeable modules are a defining characteristic of AR-15 style rifles. A stripped lower receiver, one that is lacking the additional parts included in a completed lower receiver, is the only part of an AR-15 style rifle that needs to be transferred through a federally licensed firearms dealer under United States federal law. The lower receiver is the serial- numbered part legally defined as the firearm under United States law. However, this definition is currently questionable due to a 2019 court ruling that the AR-15 lower receiver does not match the legal definition in 27 CFR ¬ß 479.11. A completed lower receiver is visually distinguished by the trigger guard ahead of the detachable pistol grip, and behind the magazine well capable of holding detachable magazines. The lower receiver holds the trigger assembly including the hammer, and is the attachment point for the buttstock. The lower receiver is attached to the upper receiver by two removable pins. Disassembly for cleaning or repair of malfunctions requires disengaging these pins from the upper receiver. Removal of the rear take-down pin allows the receiver to be opened by rotation around the forward pivot pin as a hinge. The upper receiver contains the bolt carrier assembly and is attached to the barrel assembly. Sights will be attached to the upper receiver or the barrel assembly. A handguard usually encloses the barrel and a gas-operated reloading device using burnt powder gas vented from a hole (or port) in the barrel near the forward end of the handguard. The handguard is attached to the upper receiver and may also be attached to the barrel. The initial design included a tube to vent burnt powder gas back into the bolt carrier assembly where it expands in a variable volume chamber forcing the bolt open to eject the spent cartridge case. A buffer spring in the buttstock then pushes the bolt closed picking up a new cartridge from the magazine. This direct gas impingement (DGI) system has the disadvantage of venting un-burned smokeless powder residue into the receiver where it may ultimately accumulate in quantities causing malfunctions. Some AR-15 style rifles use an alternative short-stroke gas piston design borrowed from the AR-18, where a metal rod pushes against the bolt carrier, driven by a piston located just behind the barrel gas port. This piston design keeps the rifle cleaner by not exhausting in to the receiver. While both the DGI and piston systems produce semi-automatic fire, an alternative un-ported barrel assembly includes a sliding handguard connected to a rod moving the bolt by a pump action and eliminating semi-automatic fire. Some AR15-style rifle models feature redesigned gas systems so the rifle is over-the-beach capable to let it fire safely as quickly as possible after being submerged in water. The initial design's construction did not take that capability in account.Caracal CAR814 A2 Most rifles eject spent cartridges from the right side of the receiver away from right handed shooters who place the butt against the right shoulder while sighting with the right eye and using a finger of the right hand to pull the trigger.Craige, John Houston The Practical Book of American Guns (1950) Bramhall House pp. 108‚Äì114 Right-side ejection is a disadvantage for the third of the population whose left eye is dominant, and for the tenth of the population who are left handed, because holding these rifles against their left shoulder for maximum accuracy causes the rifle to eject hot spent cases toward the chest, neck or face of a left handed shooter. The modular design of AR-15 style rifles has encouraged several manufacturers to offer specialized parts including leftward ejecting upper receivers for converting right handed AR-15 style rifles for left handed use. The AR-15 is nominally chambered in .223/5.56mm NATO, but many variants have been produced in different calibers such as .22-LR, 7.62√ó39mm, 9√ó19mm Parabellum and shotgun calibers. Some of these firearms chambered in smaller calibers such as 9mm or .22 utilise the blowback or delayed blowback operating principle instead of DI/piston as insufficient gas pressure or volume is produced by the round to cycle the action, or the simpler blowback system is sufficient and may allow removal of the rear buffer tube and spring. Some rare AR-15-style rifles are also available as bolt action firearms rendering them incapable of semi-automatic fire. These are most commonly marketed in jurisdictions where ownership of semi-automatic rifles is heavily restricted such as in the United Kingdom. Some AR-15-style rifles have features limiting use of detachable magazines to comply with state regulations. Nearly all versions of the civilian AR-15 have a pistol grip like the military versions, and some have folding or collapsible stocks like the M4 carbine which reduce the overall length of the rifle, however AR-15 style lower receivers that accept a non-pistol-grip are available.  Comparison to military versions  The semi-automatic civilian AR-15 was introduced by Colt in 1963. The primary distinction between civilian semi-automatic rifles and military assault rifles is select fire. Military models were produced with firing modes, semi- automatic fire and either fully automatic fire mode or burst fire mode, in which the rifle fires several rounds in succession when the trigger is depressed. Most components are interchangeable between semi-auto and select fire rifles including magazines, sights, upper receiver, barrels and accessories. The military M4 carbine typically uses a barrel. Civilian rifles commonly have or longer barrels to comply with the National Firearms Act. To prevent a civilian semi-automatic AR-15 from being readily converted for use with the select fire components, several features were changed. Parts changed include the lower receiver, bolt carrier, hammer, trigger, disconnector, and safety/mode selector. The semi-automatic bolt carrier has a longer lightening slot to prevent the bolt's engagement with an automatic sear. Due to a decrease in mass, the buffer spring is heavier. On the select-fire version, the hammer has an extra spur which interacts with the additional auto-sear that holds it back until the bolt carrier group is fully in battery, when the automatic fire is selected. Using a portion of the select fire parts in a semi-automatic rifle will not enable a select fire option (this requires a registered part with the ATF). Lower receivers that are select-fire are identified by a pinhole above the safety/mode selection switch.http://ugcsurvival.com/WeaponsManuals/ar15-m16%20user%20manual.pdfhttp://ugcsurvival.com/WeaponsManuals/ar15conversion%20manual.pdf As designed by Colt the pins supporting the semi-auto trigger and hammer in the lower receiver are larger than those used in the military rifle to prevent interchangeability between semi-automatic and select-fire components. Production and sales The first version produced for commercial sale by Colt was the SP1 model AR-15 Sporter, in .223 Remington, with a barrel and issued with five-round magazines. Initial sales of the Colt AR-15 were slow, primarily due to its fixed sights and carry handle that made scopes difficult to mount and awkward to use. Military development of the compact M4 carbine encouraged production of a barreled civilian SP1 carbine with a collapsible buttstock beginning in 1977. These carbines have become popular for police use in confined urban spaces, and the collapsible buttstock compensates for the additional thickness of body armor. The shorter barrel reduced bullet velocity by about five percent, and bullet energy by about ten percent. The shorter barrel required moving the gas port closer to the chamber exposing the self- loading system to higher pressures and temperatures which increase stress on moving parts like the bolt lugs and extractor. Although Colt offered a heavier 20-inch barrel for improved accuracy beginning in 1986, increased barrel weight may impair ergonomic balance; so shorter barrels have dominated recent rifle production. American Tactical OMNI AR-15 style rifle, (Lower in polymer), 5.56√ó45mm NATO caliber, with Millett DMS-1 scope and FAB Defense stock and grips In the 1990s, sales of AR-15 style rifles increased dramatically, partly as a result of the introduction of the flat top upper receiver (M4 variant) which allowed scopes and sighting devices to be easily mounted as well as new features such as free floating hand guards that increased accuracy. While only a handful of companies were manufacturing these rifles in 1994, by the 21st century the number of AR-15 style rifles had more than doubled. From 2000 to 2015, the number of manufacturers of AR-15 style variants and knock-offs increased from 29 to about 500. AR-15 style rifles are now available in a wide range of configurations and calibers from a large number of manufacturers. These configurations range from standard full-sizes rifles with barrels, to short carbine-length models with barrels, adjustable length stocks and optical sights, to long range target models with barrels, bipods and high-powered scopes.Evolution of an AR  Gear  Guns & Ammo . Archives.gunsandammo.com (August 29, 2011). Retrieved on 2011-09-27. As of September 19, 2019, Colt Firearms has announced it is discontinuing production of the AR-15. The reasons given for taking the rifle out of production were low demand for Colt-made ARs and excessive production capacity for the rifle across the firearms industry. Estimates vary as to how many of the rifles are owned in the United States. The National Shooting Sports Foundation has estimated that approximately 5 million to 10 million AR-15 style rifles exist in the U.S. within the broader total of the 300 million firearms owned by Americans. Hunting Many hunters prefer using AR-15 style rifles because of their versatility, accuracy, wide variety of available features, and wide variety of calibers (see below). Collapsible stocks are convenient for hunters who pack their rifles into remote hunting locations or for length of pull adjustments to fit any sized hunter. Construction with lightweight polymers and corrosion-resistant alloys makes these rifles preferred for hunting in moist environments with less concern about rusting or warping wood stocks. Positioning of the AR-15 safety is an improvement over traditional bolt action hunting rifles. Many states require hunters to use reduced-capacity magazines. If a hunter misses with a first shot, the self-loading feature enables rapid follow-up shots against dangerous animals like feral pigs or rapidly moving animals like jackrabbits. Hunters shooting larger game animals often use upper receivers and barrels adapted for larger cartridges or heavier bullets. Several states consider .22 caliber cartridges like the .223 Remington inadequate to ensure a clean kill.  Cartridge variations  Since the upper and lower receivers may be swapped between rifles, forensic firearm examination of bullets and spent cartridges may reveal distinguishing marks from the barrel and upper receiver group without identifying the lower receiver for which legal records may be available. An individual may use several upper receiver groups with the same lower receiver. These upper receiver groups may have differing barrel lengths and sights and may fire different cartridges. A hunter with a single lower receiver might have one upper receiver with a .223 Remington barrel and telescopic sight for varmint hunting in the open country and another upper receiver with a .458 SOCOM barrel and iron sights for big-game hunting in brushy woodland. The dimensions of upper and lower receivers originally designed for the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge impose an overall length limit and diameter limits when adapting modules for other cartridges included in this list of AR platform calibers.U.S. Military Small Arms Ammunition Failures and Solutions, GK Roberts, NDIA Dallas, TX, May 21, 2008 The same magazine in the lower receiver group may hold differing numbers of different cartridges. Use in crime and mass shootings A majority of firearm-related homicides in the United States involve the use of handguns. According to a 2013 analysis by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, 14 out of 93 mass shootings involved high- capacity magazines or assault weapons. Nevertheless, AR-15 style rifles have played a prominent role in many high-profile mass shootings in the United States and have come to be widely characterized as the weapon of choice for perpetrators of these crimes. AR-15s or similar rifles were the primary weapons used in around half of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern American history,The LA Times identified five shootings including the Pulse Nightclub Shooting. Early reports on that shooting identified the rifle as an AR-15. Later reports noted that the rifle was a SIG MCX , including the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, the 2015 San Bernardino attack, the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting, and the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Gun expert Dean Hazen and mass murder researcher Pete Blair think that mass shooters' gun choices have less to do with the AR-15's specific characteristics but rather with familiarity and a copycat effect. Following the use of a Colt AR-15 rifle in the Port Arthur massacre, the worst single- person shooting incident in Australian history, the country enacted the National Firearms Agreement in 1996, restricting the private ownership of semi-automatic rifles. (Category D). As a result of the Christchurch mosque shootings with an AR-15 during Friday Prayer on 15 March 2019, the New Zealand government enacted a law to ban semi-automatic firearms, magazines, and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms.\\"New Zealand initiates bill to ban guns used in mosque attack\\".

He was born in Luwuchi village in Rumphi to Amos Gowa Nyasulu and Mary Ana Nyaukandawire. He died on December 11, 2012 in South Africa. At the time of his death, his name was associated to the design of many major roads and bridges in the Republic of Malawi. Career After receiving his masters, he worked as a civil servant at Ministry of works where he rose to the title of Controller of lands valuation and water. He was retired early on political grounds after which he went to South Africa and worked for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research of Southern Africa as the technical manager. During his tenure at CSIR he scooped two prestigious awards. One for Technological excellency and the other for Marketing excellency. He began his political career as an executive member of AFORD by joining a South African wing of AFORD. He then became Member of Parliament for Rumphi East. By 1999 he had returned to Malawi working as chair of the Public Works Committee of Parliament in Malawi whilst working as a national campaign director for AFORD. He also headed the Mphizi Engineering Consulting Firm. He worked as the Chairperson of Electrical Supply Commission. He became the President of Aford in the House in 2003. During his leadership as an Aford president Dindi practically financed the party from his pocket, a gesture of love and dedication to the nation and an attribute which Khwauli Msiska the secretary general of Aford acknowledged. He resigned from his position as President of AFORD in 2012, prior to his death. He was succeeded by Godfrey Shawa. Personal He was born in Luwuchi in Rumphi district to a family of nine. His parents named him Dindi which means grave as they lost many children at infancy. Little did they know this was just the beginning of this remarkable man. A son of a fisherman, who through sheer determination and fighting spirit found himself in the shores of America at University of Washington where he obtained his Civil Engineering degree (Cum Laude). He later went and obtained his master's degree at university of Birmingham. His name is associated with many designs and construction of many roads in Malawi. He started formal education at Chiweta Primary School. He then attended Livingstonia Secondary School but later transferred to Dedza Secondary School, and then Blantyre Secondary School. He was married to Idabel Nyasopera Mwafulirwa and had five children. Tafiska Nyasulu an Investor and business analyst who is doing a doctorate in Economics, Yavuska Nyasulu Okie a chemist, Dr Chizgani Nyasulu Egbunike a paediatrician, Kamphinda Nyasulu an Entrepreneur who has now taken over the running of Mphizi consulting engineers and Dr Yanila Nyasulu who is specialising in internal medicine. He also had five grand children. Fumilayo, Phokwa, Zangi, Olu Segun and Zikora. Dindi Gowa Nyasulu believed in education. During his lifetime he educated many people. Giving was his second nature. He used to tell his children that, it was through people's giving spirit that I came this far'. He believed in himself and used to say 'Bakababa Bakawilinganya' meaning \\"when my parents gave birth to me they did a perfect job. A man who loved to dance and at the end of his life told his children. I feel favoured by God to have had you as my friends for I know this is not the end of my story but the beginning of a tale of the extraordinary man in me, love each other.\\" Dindi Gowa Nyasulu was also spiritual. He told his children to always put God first in everything they do. At the time of his death he was a church elder what they call Madodana in the Livingstonia synod of CCAP. The Livingstonia synod remembers Dindi for his great contribution to the church, financially and intellectually. At his funeral service at his home in Malawi, the reverend prayed and said that the Lord God our father need to be thanked for the gift of Dindi Gowa Nyasulu to the nation and for all his work during his life for the Lord saw it fit that this remarkable man had accomplished his job. His favourite song in chitumbuka was Ine umoya wane ndi yesu which means my life belongs to Jesus. Not only was he an intellect, but was also a states man, a man who knew his creator and a wonderful and amazing father. As we mourned Dindi one of his daughters cried out 'job well done my father' meaning that he actually did an excellent job at raising her. He was buried at a private grave in his home village of Luwuchi by the shores of Lake Malawi. Tafiska Nyasulu, his first born adds and says ' what a great teacher he was and I feel honoured that on this earth, i was trained by such a great master.'What an extraordinary life, surely to be celebrated.

It compares cells (formulae, constants and calculated values), comments, defined ranges (names) and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros. Before a cell-by-cell comparison, similar rows and columns between two spreadsheets have to be aligned by the insertion of blank rows/columns. Otherwise identical cells between two workbooks will be missed. It runs on Microsoft Windows. Excel Spreadsheets A spreadsheet is essentially a grid made up of rows and columns. New rows and columns can be inserted into a workbook with existing content. Row insertion pushes all the content below it down. Column insertion pushes content after it to the right. Excel workbooks support both relative and absolute cell references, which refer to other cells. References allow formula to use the content of other cells in their calculations. An absolute reference refers to a specific cell with a fixed row and column reference. This reference never varies when copied into other cells. A relative reference refers to a cell a certain displacement from the current cell. The cell referred to can change when the formula is copied or displaced into other cells. Compare Excel Spreadsheets / Worksheets: The Problems One of the problems when comparing Excel workbooks is taking into account new row and column insertion. The same content in two workbooks could have different row and column coordinates. Additionally relative references may have new cell coordinates if they use A1 (e.g. =A1) rather than R1C1 (e.g. =R[-1]C[-1]) notation. The cell reference A1 means one cell up and one cell to the left when found in cell B2. If this cell reference is displaced into cell C3 it becomes B2. In R1C1 notation, the cell reference R[-1]C[-1] remains the same wherever it is moved to. Before spreadsheet comparison DiffEngineX aligns rows and columns to ensure no spurious differences are reported. Blank rows and columns are inserted to align similar content. The goal is to ensure similar content has the same row and column numbers in both the workbooks being compared, otherwise not only could you end up comparing the wrong cells with each other, but even if you match up the right cells, they will be difficult to compare properly due to A1 reference notation. Compare Excel Workbooks - Not Just The Visible Cells Tools that compare Excel spreadsheets not only have to contend with comparing the worksheet cells, but also cell comments, defined ranges (names) and embedded Visual Basic for Application (VBA) macros. Each cell can either contain a formula or a constant, such as a date, number or string. If the cell contains a formula, DiffEngineX allows the user a choice between comparing the actual text of the formula or its calculated value. Alignment Of Matched Rows And Separation Of Unmatched Rows Workbooks can contain rows of database-like data rather than formulae. If the rows are pre-sorted DiffEngineX can correctly compare them when row alignment is selected. DiffEngineX requires the user to specify columns that act as unique row identifiers. Any pair of rows with the same identifiers will be aligned between the two workbooks being compared. For these cases, DiffEngineX must insert blank rows not just to align similar rows, but to ensure mismatched rows (with different identifiers) end up paired with blanks. This makes it easier to spot the addition of new rows and the deletion of old rows as their matching row will always be empty. Excel's Maximum Row Limit and Running Time The launch of Excel 2007 increased the maximum row limit to 1,048,576. DiffEngineX's row alignment algorithm runs in m log n time, where m and n refer to the number of rows in the two spreadsheets being compared. Typically longest common subsequence problem algorithms run in quadratic time and as such would be ill-suited to comparing spreadsheets with hundreds of thousands of rows.

Chile also currently uses a mixture of both types of mandatory signs. Chile drives on the right. Road Signs (Se√±ales Reglamentarias) Priority signs (Se√±ales de Prioridad) The priority section includes three signs: Give Way, Stop, and Stop for Children. The give way sign indicates to drivers that they must slow down and give way to vehicles on the approaching road, but that they do not need to stop if there is enough room to join or merge. The stop sign indicates to drivers that they must come to a complete stop before joining the approaching road, and is reserved for situations where a raised risk of an accident exists if drivers were not to fully stop before proceeding. The stop for children sign is used by crossing guards, and indicates to drivers that they must come to a complete stop and wait while children cross the road.

Fossils have subsequently been recovered from the Late Miocene Tatsumitoge Formation in the Tomata District and the Early Miocene Ito-o Formation in the Fukui Prefecture. Other fossils have been included in the species from North Korea and Kamchatka, Russia. A single isolated fossil fruit possibly belonging to A. palaeorufinerve is known from North America. The specimen was recovered from the latest Early to early Middle Miocene Seldovia Point flora in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska. Description Leaves of A. palaeorufinerve are simple in structure with a palmate actinodromous vein structure in which the primary veins originate at the base of the lamina and run out towards the margin. The leaves range between three and five-lobed with a length to width ratio of 1:2, giving an overall pentagonal outline. The leaves have three or five primary veins, and at least one specimen is estimated to have been long by wide in overall dimensions. The samaras of A. palaeorufinerve have a nutlet which is flattened asymmetrically and a high attachment angle. The morphology of A. palaeorufinerve suggests placement into the Acer section Macrantha. This is based on the overall leaf shape and long pointed shape of the lobe tips. The combination of morphological characters is noted to be most similar to leaves of the living maple species Acer rufinerve, commonly called the redvein or Honsh≈´ maple. The fossil species A. latahense from Washington state and Oregon is distinguishable from A. palaeorufinerve by the narrower medial lobe. Paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe and Toshimasa Tanai suggest A latahense may be a descendant species of A. palaeorufinerve.

The area had traditionally been used as an aboriginal camping ground and was then used by drovers taking stock from New South Wales to Adelaide. When the New South Wales gold rush began in 1851, Overland Corner developed as a point where timber was supplied to fuel paddle steamers taking prospectors up the Murray River. A small police post was established in Overland Corner in 1855, built by Edward Bate Scott. It closed in 1894. A school was opened and remained open until at least 1904.

Published by √âditions du Seuil, it appeared intermittently until the double issue of 1976. The title was revived in 2006 to distribute preparatory texts for the congresses of the World Association of Psychoanalysis and is now published in both French and Spanish. The new series began with a digital volume and has since extended to four print volumes.  History  In the 1964 \\"Founding Act\\" of the √âcole Freudienne de Paris, Lacan declared that \\"The financial holdings constituted initially by the contributions of the members of the √âcole, by the funding it will eventually receive, indeed by the services it will render as a school, will be entirely reserved for its publishing efforts\\".Lacan, Jacques \\"Founding Act\\", Television/A Challenge to the Psychoanalytic Establishment. The first issue of the Lettres de l‚Äô√âcole freudienne de Paris appeared in early 1967 and the first issue of Scilicet followed in the spring of 1968, thereby meeting the pledge set out in the Act to create a platform by which to take inventory of the Freudian field. In Lacan's introduction to Scilicet issue 1 he writes, \\"This journal is one of the means by which I expect to overcome in my √âcole, which is distinct in its principle from the [existing] Societies, the obstacle that resisted me elsewhere\\".Lacan, Jacques, \\"Introduction de Scilicet au titre de la revue de l‚ÄôEFP\\", quoted in Price, A. \\"Dead Reckoning by Makeshift Means\\". Hurly-Burly 8 2012. The Latin word wikt:scilicet, a frequent term in the writings of Lucretius, literally means \\"thou mayst know\\" or \\"it is permitted thee to know\\", and the cover of the journal bore the inscription: Tu peux savoir ce qu‚Äôen pense l‚Äô√âcole freudienne de Paris (thou mayst know what the √âcole freudienne de Paris thinks about it). Lacan defined this \\"thou\\" as \\"the bachelor, in the English sense\\", as \\"one who is not married‚Ä¶ and, above all, not wed to a psychoanalytic society\\".Lacan, Jacques, Interview in Le Monde, 16 March 1968. Established at a time of considerable institutional invention, Scilicet adopted the editorial strategy of the Bourbaki group, publishing unsigned articles in an attempt to \\"overcome the narcissism of small differences\\" and to open the doors to analysts from outside the EFP whose institutional affiliations might otherwise discourage them from contributing. However, issue 2/3 did carry a list of twenty names of contributors to issue 1. The same editorial policy was later adopted by other psychoanalytic journals.S√©dat, Jacques, \\"Scilicet\\", Gale Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Initially announced as a triannual publication, the fallout of May 1968, which had a direct bearing on Lacan's teaching at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, delayed the editing of the second issue and the rhythm continued to be sporadic until its final issue.Lacan, Jacques, \\"Liminaire, En mani√®re d‚Äôexcuse √† l‚Äô√âcole \\", Appendix 2 to Autres √©crits, 2001, p. 592-595. Scilicet is important in the history of the psychoanalytic movement because of the major texts of Lacan that featured in each of its issues: \\"Proposition of 9 October on the Psychoanalyst of the School\\" (issue 1); \\"Radiophonie\\" (issue 2/3); \\"L‚Äô√©tourdit\\" (issue 4); \\"‚Ä¶ou pire\\" (issue 5) and finally the lectures and interviews that Lacan gave at Yale University, Columbia University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1975 (issue 6/7). In 2006, Scilicet was revived for the preparatory work of the fifth congress of the World Association of Psychoanalysis in Rome on \\"The Name-of-the-Father\\". A second volume, for the sixth congress in Buenos Aires, appeared in print as \\"The Objects a in the Psychoanalytic Experience\\", published by the Collection rue Huysmans (2008). This was followed by \\"Semblants and Sinthome\\", the 2010 Paris congress, and then \\"The Symbolic Order in the Twenty-First Century\\" (Buenos Aires, 2012).

After World War II von Bolschwing became a spy and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Europe and later in California. Life Otto Albrecht von Bolschwing was born in Sch√∂nbruch, District of Bartenstein, East Prussia (now: Szczurkowo, Poland) on October 15, 1909. He was descended from the aristocratic . He was educated at the University of Breslau and the University of London. He joined the Nazi Party in April 1932 and after the Nazis came to power the following year he became a member of the SS. Bolschwing was assigned to the foreign intelligence section of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and worked as an undercover agent in Mandatory Palestine, exchanging promises of encouraging young Jews to emigrate for intelligence about the British supplied by the Haganah.Peter Levenda, Ratline: Soviet Spies, Nazi Priests, and the Disappearance of Adolf Hitler, Lake Worth, Florida: Ibis, 2012, , n.p.John Loftus and Mark Aarons, The Secret War Against the Jews: How Western Espionage Betrayed The Jewish People, New York: St. Martin's, 1994, , pp. 46, 140. He was closely associated with Adolf Eichmann, became his adjutant, and had some involvement in the planning of the Final Solution.Peter Wyden, The Hitler Virus: The Insidious Legacy of Adolf Hitler, Boston, Massachusetts: Little, Brown / London: Kuperard, 2001, , p. 8. In 1937 he wrote a memorandum concerning Jewish emigration, referencing the anti- Jewish riots in Berlin in 1935: His report suggested bureaucratic methods such as economic restrictions, special taxes, and passport denials to purge Germany of its Jews. Heinrich Himmler was impressed with the report, and assigned von Bolschwing to work under Adolf Eichmann. Over the following years, von Bolschwing wrote dozens of memos and reports on how to persecute Jews. His suggestions to Eichmann included confiscating money from Jews, labeling them on their passports, and allowing Jews to leave Germany but not to return. Rather than advocating the mass murder of Jews, he proposed making their lives so terrifying and unbearable that they would voluntarily leave Germany.Lichtblau, Eric: The Nazis Next Door: How America Became a Safe Haven for Hitler's Men Later, von Bolschwing became the representative of the SD at the German embassy in Bucharest, Romania, where he organised an anti-Jewish pogrom with the Iron Guard in 1941, in which 125 Jews were killed. He was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (captain) on 30 January 1941. After returning to Germany in March 1941 Bolschwing pursued to a career in business, becoming a partner with the Bank voor Onroerende Zaken, an Amsterdam-based bank which played a role in the confiscation of assets belonging to Jewish citizens in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. According to Eric Lichtblau, von Bolschwing's actions were not motivated by antisemitism so much as by the desire for power and wealth. Lichtblau noted that in the midst of the Holocaust, von Bolschwing married a half-Jewish woman. Post-war Before the end of World War II in 1945, von Bolschwing had already been recruited by the American Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC), the counter- espionage arm of the US Army Secret Service, which was later merged into the CIA. It has been speculated that this was because he recognized Germany was destined to lose the war, and decided to work with the winning side. Already in spring 1945, he was working for them in Salzburg. According to the CIA he was one of their highest-ranking agents in Europe.Loftus and Aarons, p. 46.Klaus Eichner and Gotthold Schramm (Eds.): Angriff und Abwehr. Die deutschen Geheimdienste nach 1945, Berlin: Edition Ost, 2007, , p. 170 He provided intelligence on Nazi colleagues and German military operations. In 1949 he joined the Gehlen Organization and mobilized former contacts in Italy in order to influence the events of the Greek Civil War, while providing intelligence of possible subversion by communist agents. After being expelled for ineptitude and insubordination, he began working for the CIA, running an anti-Soviet spy network composed of ex-Nazis in Austria. During this period, the CIA's knowledge of von Bolscwhing's Nazi past was limited. He admitted to having been a card-carrying member of Nazi Party, but claimed that he only joined it as a way of getting government approval for a cement factory he wanted to build in East Prussia, and that he had tried to thwart Hitler. Some officials within the CIA had doubts about him. An early assessment of him stating that the CIA's knowledge of his war record \\"rests almost entirely on his own unsupported statements,\\" referring to him as \\"self-seeking, egoistical, and a man of shifting loyalties.\\" Other memos referred to him as a \\"shady character\\" and suggested he be held with a \\"tight rein.\\" The CIA possessed evidence linking von Bolschwing to Eichmann and the high echelons of the SS. A source believed to be reliable fingered him as a member of the SD, and another source in Poland identified him as the SS's top man in working with the Romanian Iron Guard. Nevertheless, the CIA decided to use his services, with one assessment claiming that his past Nazi Party membership was \\"relatively inconsequential, particularly in view of the subject's excellent service on our behalf.\\" In 1950, the Austrian government inquired about von Bolschwing due to war crimes suspicions, and the CIA rushed to shield him from potential prosecution. The Austrians were told that there was \\"no file available\\" on him. A few years later, after he had run into visa problems, the CIA tried to help him gain Austrian citizenship. When this proved unsuccessful, the CIA decided to help him emigrate to the United States. The CIA helped expedite his application for a US visa, withheld information from the US State Department about his Nazi past, and booked tickets for him and his wife on a luxury cruise ship voyage to the US. When von Bolschwing and his wife arrived in the US on February 2, 1954, they were met by a military intelligence officer who had worked with him in Europe, and were hosted in his Boston home for a few months. Having brought him to the US as what it saw as a reward for his service, the CIA ended its relationship with von Bolschwing, ordering him to break off all relations and to contact them only in the event of a \\"dire emergency\\" which was a \\"life or death situation.\\" In the US, von Bolschwing became the executive of a series of drug and chemical companies, and served as a consultant for projects in Germany, often traveling there for business. In 1959, he became a US citizen. He became well-connected, and was put in line for a prestigious posting as a State Department representative for international development in India. In May 1960, von Bolschwing's former superior Adolf Eichmann, who was living in Argentina under a false identity, was abducted by Israeli agents and smuggled to Israel, where he would be tried and executed. News of the abduction caused von Bolscwhing to fear that he was next. He correctly predicted that his name would come up at Eichmann's trial, and feared that a renewed probe into the Nazis' Jewish affairs office as part of the prosecution efforts would uncover his own role. Fearing that he would be prosecuted and that the Israelis might even abduct him the same way they had abducted Eichmann, he contacted one of his former handlers, expressing his fears and claiming that he was afraid for his life. The CIA, in turn, was desperate to keep his name and involvement with Eichmann a secret. West German intelligence agents who spent a month in Washington perusing US intelligence files on their own unearthed massive evidence linking von Bolschwing directly to Eichmann and the Jewish affairs office. Despite the fact that this information had been sitting in the CIA's files for years, the agency blamed him for his dishonesty in minimizing his role with the Nazi Party for the predicament it now found itself in. The CIA agreed to protect von Bolschwing, promising that it would not turn him over to Israel and that it would withhold evidence of his past from the US Justice Department. Had the Justice Department received the evidence, it potentially could have opened deportation proceedings against him, and had he been deported, he risked prosecution in West Germany or Austria. In exchange, von Bolschwing had to renounce his candidacy for development representative in India. In 1969 von Bolschwing was working for the California computer leasing company Trans-International Computer Investment Corporation of Sacramento, which had contracts for the Defense Department. He rose to vice-president, but his job there ended when the company became embroiled in a financial scandal, and it subsequently went bankrupt in 1971.Ron Blubaugh, McClatchy News Service, \\"Three Are Charged With Stock Swindle\\", Sacramento Bee, 8 June 1972, p. 9.

It was founded in 1987 by Paruyr Hayrikyan, a Soviet dissident seeking independence for Armenia. History After the 1995 Armenian parliamentary election, the party gained 3 seats in the National Assembly. The party lost all representation in the National Assembly after the 1999 Armenian parliamentary election. Following a long absence from politics, Paruyr Hayrikyan announced his intentions to create a \\"democratic alliance\\" with other liberal pro-democratic parties. Prior to the 2017 Armenian parliamentary election, the Union for National Self-Determination requested to join the Way Out Alliance, however their request was never responded too. Despite the set-back, Hayrikyan confirmed that the Union for National Self- Determination will participate in future key elections, however the party would not participate in the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election. Activities In April 2016, Paruyr Hayrikyan held a press conference with Tigran Khzmalyan, leader of the European Party of Armenia. Both leaders announced the creation of a mass-petition to be signed by citizens calling on the government to give up cooperation with Russia and deepen their ties with European institutions. In June 2019, during a press conference, Hayrikyan urged Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to strengthen democratic values in Armenia. On 30 November 2019, Hayrikyan called on the government of Armenia to recognize the Ukrainian Holodomor as a genocide during a speech at the Ukrainian Embassy in Yerevan. Ideology The party believes that the Caucasus region, including Armenia should move towards European Union integration and have greater integration with Western countries. The party has maintained for 15 years the position that the integration of Armenia and Azerbaijan into the EU would make the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict senseless, and therefore EU integration should be pursued as a lasting solution to the conflict.

New Birmingham once seemed destined to be a major industrial mecca in the heart of east Texas. Lying just off U.S. Highway 69, the site was about two miles southeast of the county seat of Rusk, Texas. Beginnings Conceived in 1887, New Birmingham was the brainchild of Anderson Blevins, a sewing machine salesman originally from Alabama. Traveling through east Texas, he became aware of copious deposits of iron ore in the area of Rusk, Texas, and having familiarity with Birmingham in his home state, was struck with the possibility of a similar industrial mecca in east Texas. Discovering that some small-scale iron processing was already occurring at Rusk Penitentiary,Rusk Penitentiary he approached his brother-in- law, W. H. Hamman, who enthusiastically supported the venture. Hamman was an attorney, an ex-Confederate General and a wealthy, well-established oil-man. Together, they brought in a number of local investors, formed a company to develop the idea and began taking options on ore-laden acreage. Venture capital was also raised from H. H. Wibirt of New York and Richard Coleman of St. Louis, and by 1888 the company, under the name of Cherokee Land & Iron Company, was purchasing land suitable for mining. Eventually, some 20,000 acres had been acquired and construction of a smelting plant to develop the ore was begun. Two 50-ton furnaces‚Äîone called the \\"Tassie Belle\\" after Blevins' wife, the other called \\"Star and Crescent\\"‚Äîwere constructed and quickly went into production. Additional capital from St. Louis and New York allowed the firm to reorganize as the New Birmingham Iron and Land Company. Anderson Blevins was on the Board of Directors; H.H. Wibirt of New York and Richard Coleman served as president and vice-president, respectively. (The company would undergo another reorganization and name-change in 1890, becoming the New Birmingham Iron and Development Co.) Meanwhile, a pipe works and brick kiln were constructed and a coal-fired electric generating plant promised the utmost in modern convenience for new residents. \\"Iron Queen of the Southwest\\" In September 1889, the town of New Birmingham was incorporated. Banks, a railway depot, a schoolhouse, a weekly newspaper, an ice plant and electricity from a coal-fired plant‚Äîall these created an impression not only of great potential, but of an established community. And then, there was the Southern Hotel, a palatial structure described as follows by Hattie Joplin Roach in her History of Cherokee County: > The Southern Hotel, which the promoting company erected at a cost of more > than $60,000 was the center of New Birmingham's gay life. Its first > register, beginning March 28, 1889, and closing Feb. 9, 1890, recorded > guests from twenty-eight states, including Jay Gould of railroad fame and > Grover Cleveland, recently come from the presidential chair, Robert A. Van > Wyck, financiers, who had risked their millions in the attempted development > of Cherokee County's iron ore were frequently registered. Along with the > millionaires were citizens from nearby towns come for thrill as well as > business, and newspaper representatives sent for copy. On one day there were > guests from eight states.King, p.74 In its prospectus issued in October 1891, the company stated: > On Nov. 12, 1888, New Birmingham had not a single house completed. It was > entirely in the woods. Today, with nearly 400 buildings completed and > occupied, she claims and justly so, a population of 1,500. The streets are > graded, and houses and streets lighted with electricity; the business houses > are the best class of brick buildings; it boasts a street railway and a > magnificent hotel, the Southern, with all modern improvements. The > industries represented today are two blast furnaces, a pipe foundry, planing > mill, sash and door factory, steam laundry, and steam bakery and other > industries being negotiated for.King, p. 75 To all appearances, the \\"Iron Queen\\", as she had been dubbed by her promoters, seemed poised to rule. Demise As if to suggest that successful cities are those which emerge naturally as need dictates, rather than from the visions of speculators and promoters, New Birmingham was destined to fold back into the pine forest from which it emerged and become the distant memory it is today. In the 1890s, two circumstances converged to doom the aspirations of the New Birmingham planners. Capital A shortage of capital led the management of the company to seek investment from the British sources; the promotion there was met with considerable interest and, indeed, members of a British investment syndicate, the Baring Brothers, traveled to Texas to evaluate the potential at New Birmingham. Favorably impressed with the development at New Birmingham, they were all the more encouraged by the abundance of resources available so near the operations. In short order, they had committed to infuse the venture with upwards of $1,000,000. Legalities and politics intruded to bar this solution. The \\"Alien Land Law of Texas\\" flatly barred these potential investors from having any interest in a company whose assets were in the soil of Texas. Recently put into effect, ostensibly, to protect ranchers in West Texas from land speculation by wealthy foreign investors, the statute had been promoted by Governor James Hogg. Hogg was, himself, a native of Rusk and Cherokee County. The management of NBI&D; lobbied the governor to support an amendment to the law, but if he ever considered a move to assist the people of his home county, there was little evidence of it. In spite of being wined, dined and otherwise feted throughout New Birmingham and the Southern Hotel, Hogg stood firmly against any moderation of the Alien Land Law. Calamity Then the Panic of 1893 overtook the country, collapsing markets across the board. Lack of demand for pig iron led to a shutdown of the plants and without the jobs that had brought them there, people began to drift out of New Birmingham. An explosion seriously damaged the Tassie Belle furnace and further complicated matters, but had economic conditions been better, that might have a temporary setback. Curse The fall of New Birmingham was not without apocryphal blame. For years, some citizens of the fading mecca attached their troubles to a curse placed on the town by a bereaved widow. On July 14, 1890, General W. H. Hamman had been gunned down in the streets of the town by an enraged husband seeking to avenge imagined insults directed at his wife, either by Hamman or his wife. S. T. Cooney, the shooter, was arrested, tried, found guilty and sent to prison for manslaughter. If in her view that was not sufficient penalty for the loss of her husband, Mrs. Hamman's exasperation came to full boil when in 1892, Mr. Cooney was pardoned. In a fit of outrage and grief, Mrs. Hamman (with some irony the sister of Tassie Belle Blevins) took to the streets beseeching the Almighty to destroy the city and have it swallowed by the forest from whence it had come. Apocryphal, almost certainly. The greater damage to the future of New Birmingham was the death of W. H. Hamman, whose money, influence and business acumen had been instrumental from the beginning. But in any case, by the end of the year the town was virtually abandoned. Slide into oblivion New Birmingham languished. The nearly 400 homes there, boarded up and empty, begin to fall into disrepair or were dismantled, as were storefronts in the business district. But before it entirely disappeared, some attempts were made to resurrect the town and its industry. In 1899, the Record Brothers contemplated construction of a new smelter, but nothing came of it. Loath to relinquish his dream, Anderson Blevins attempted to reopen the foundry in 1907, but nothing came of that. As luck would have it, there was the Panic of 1907. By 1910, the last actual resident had moved out of the town and during World War I the ironworks and many remaining buildings were scrapped. The Southern Hotel remained, occupied only by a maintenance man, but in 1926, otherwise vacant for 33 years, it was consumed by flame. In 1932, the New Birmingham school was razed to make way for U.S. Highway 69 running south of Rusk. An historical marker was erected at the site of New Birmingham in 1966. Tassie Belle Historical Park contains vestigial ruins of that furnace.

Early years Born in Copenhagen, Berg was the son of weight manufacturer, and captain in the Copenhagen Fire Brigade, Vilhelm Julius Berg and Caroline Frederikke Albine Bruun. He studied carpentry when he was 16 but a year later, in 1873, he began studying architecture.

Retrieved 13 December 2012. Career Berg, who practiced a Historicist approach, had a good sense of which style to use for each of his projects. His first project was the almost complete renovation of Bregentved in the Rococo style (1891), for which he was awarded the C. F. Hansen Medal in 1893. His renovation of Vemmetofte Convent (1909) was Early Baroque.\\"Axel Berg\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 13 December 2012. He was awarded the Neuhausen Prize in 1885 and in 1910, the Eckersberg Medal. In addition to country houses, he designed a number of banks and office buildings, including Privatbanken's headquarters in various styles (1911). Berg was chairman of the Architects' Association of Denmark in 1902-04 and again in 1907-09, becoming an honorary member in 1924. He was a member of the Competition Committee for Christiansborg Palace in 1904, a consultant to the Danish Ministry of Culture in matters relating to church heating 1894-1923, and was a member of the Royal Academy's plenary session in 1911. Berg was behind the establishment of the Architects Association Support Fund, to which he devoted much time and effort, also supporting it financially. He participated in exhibitions at Charlottenborg Palace in 1885, 1905 and 1910; a commemorative exhibition was held in 1930. Berg also participated in the Nordic Exhibition of 1888, and the Copenhagen City Hall Exhibition in 1901. He exhibited in Berlin in 1910 and 1911. He was of the last generation of historicist architects who freely imitated or worked various historical styles. But he was not a supporter of a single style as some of his contemporaries were, However, he used the Baroque and Rococo styles as starting points. Berg never married and is buried in the Vestre Cemetery. Works * Epitaph in Helsing√∏r Cathedral (Neuhausen Prize 1885) * New manor house and farm building in Bregentved (1887‚Äì1891, C. F.

It has from six to ten syllables per line, and no strict metrical scheme, but the rhyme scheme is throughout of ABCB quatrains. It was first published in 1765 in Bishop Thomas Percy's three volume compilation of ballads entitled Reliques of Ancient English Poetry.

Synopsis  Robin Hood one day sees a cheerful young man dressed in red, singing and playing in the greenwood: it is Alan Dale. The next day, he sees him again, dejected. He sends two of his Merry Men, Little John and Much the Miller's Son, to apprehend him. Robin asks Alan for money; but he explains that he has but little, and that the cause of his sorrow is that his true love is to be married to an elderly knight. When Alan agrees to serve Robin, the latter springs into action. He turns up at the church as a harper, but refuses to play: firstly, until he has seen the bride and groom; secondly, after he has seen them, because he does not consider the old man and the young girl a suitable match. He blows his horn: and his Merry Men, now including Alan, appear. The bishop refuses to marry Alan and the girl, because it is the law that consent must be asked three times. Robin puts the bishop's cloak on Little John, who mockingly asks the question seven timesand then marries the young couple, Robin giving away the bride in loco parentis. All then - except, presumably, for the old knight and the bishop - repair to the greenwood.

Although Langcake's parents were not artistic, he was apprenticed in his mid-teens to a German immigrant woodcarver. In 1913 he married Elsie Isabel Johnson and they had four daughters; one dying in infancy. As a young man he took the pledge of the Independent Order of Rechabites, which promoted temperance in Melbourne at the turn of the 20th century. His abstinence was so strict, he refused to enter public houses even for meals. Langcake was also a lifelong rationalist and became a trusted mentor to the younger anarchist writer Arthur \\"Bluey\\" Howells (1907‚Äì86), who was involved in the anti-Franco and pacifist movements between the wars. When Langcake's first grandson was born at the outbreak of World War II, he wryly observed \\"more cannon fodder\\". His original Therry st. shopfront studio off Queen Victoria Market was the unusual setting for informal gatherings of Melbourne's radicals and progressives. By the mid-30s, Langcake's business was successful enough for him to move into more upmarket premises in the Queen Street Law Chambers building. He specialised in near life-sized figures of Christ on the cross, eagle lecterns, cathedra, bas reliefs, commemorative plaques and coats of arms, but could also produce charmingly informal works, often decorative castings for hotels or unique private commissions, adorned with Australiana flora and fauna. Langcake frequently worked with the prolific church architect Louis R. Williams (1890‚Äì1980) on major projects around Australia. He was entrusted to sculpt unique heritage logs of exceptional age (greater than 1,000 years), beauty, circumference or cultural significance. He often sourced his exotic wood from North Queensland old-growth forests. Langcake was also skilled in all aspects of cabinetry; creating fine articles of carved wooden furniture. His technique for alloy pieces was creation in wood and realization in cast metal, usually bronze (e.g. the Australian American War Memorial wreath). During the 1940s he also taught woodcarving to trade students at Collingwood Technical School. Howells praised his artistry as a true sculptor in wood. Life-sized figure of Christ for altar, 1937, St. Thomas Aquinas' Church, Sth Yarra, Vic. In the early 1960s Langcake moved from inner Melbourne to Frankston on the Mornington Peninsula to live next to one of his daughters. His modest workshop full of wood shavings, jars of preserved insects or the odd snake, and old copies of Australian Walkabout magazine for inspiration, was built at the back of his house. He died in his sleep of a heart attack in 1967.

Origins Prior to 1887, the purchase of horses was the responsibility of individual regimental colonels, in the case of cavalry regiments, or of agents acting on behalf of the artillery and engineers.Moore-Colyer (1995) p 56 This system worked well enough in peacetime but rapidly broke down during war when demand exceeded supply, prices rose and, the price that could be paid per horse being set by the Government, regimental purchasing officers and agents were frequently left with the most inferior animals. Consequently, in 1887 the Remount Department was set up in order to ensure the uniformity and suitability of the animals purchased for the army, and their training. Owners were encouraged to register a proportion of their horses with the Department, the Department having the option of purchasing these animals for a fixed sum in time of emergency. In recompense for this, the owners were paid a pension of 10/- per year for each animal. In 1891, the service became part of the Army Service Corps (ASC)Arborfield Local History Society: Arborfield and the Army Remount Service and the majority of other ranks at remount depots were drawn from the ASC.Kent Fallen: Pluckley Remount Depot Initially, there were three remount depots, the Remount Establishment at Woolwich (which provided horses for the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers and Army Service Corps) and two in Dublin (for the cavalry),War Office (1902) p 1 with a total Army establishment of 12,500 horses and mules. The Boer War showed these arrangements to have been entirely inadequate (326,000 horses and 51,000 mules were lost, mainly through diseaseArmy Medical Services Museum: History of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps ), so the animal establishment was increased to 25,000 and two additional depots were authorized, at Melton Mowbray, and Arborfield. In 1911, a further depot, the privately owned Pilckard's Farm in Chiddingfold near Godalming, was given to the War Office by its owners for a period of 21 years.Planet News Archive: Society girls train horses for the Army at Britain's only private remount depot - 10-August-1931Some difficulty was encountered in returning this depot to its owners at the end of the lease.Hansard: Remount Depot, Chiddingfold These depots provided total remount accommodation in the United Kingdom for some 1,200 animals.War Office (1922) p 396 The Remount Service was only responsible for supplying horses and mules for use in Britain. Animals used by the Indian Army were entirely purchased by the Indian Government and those used by the British Army in the Middle East and elsewhere were bought by the local General Officer Commanding.War Office (1902) p 1-2 The Great War The outbreak of war in 1914, therefore, found the British Army with a total establishment of 25,000 horses and mules, five Remount Depots and four Remount companies, with a remount strength of approximately 1,200 animals.Mark Conrad, 1996: The British Army, 1914War Office (1922) p 396 Within 12 days, the establishment had been increased to 165,000 animals, entirely by impressment, and a year later, in August 1915, to 534,971. At its peak in 1917, the Army establishment reached almost 870,000 horses and mules, with remount accommodation for 60,000 animals.War Office (1922) p 396 To cope with this increase, four additional main Home depots were established, at Shirehampton, Romsey, Ormskirk and Swaythling, and the capacity and complement of each depot were also increased. At Swaythling, for example, on 1 April 1919 (several months after the end of the war), 3,530 horses and mules were stabled and cared for by 757 men.The Army Service Corps of 1914-1918: The Army Remount Service The first three of these depots were used for horses and mules arriving from overseas, whilst Swaythling was a collection centre for animals being shipped abroad. Several other smaller depots were established throughout the country for receipt of locally bred horses. The establishment of officers and men was also increased to cope with this number of animals, from 121 officers and 230 men in August 1914 to 423 officers and 20,560 men in 1917.War Office (1922) p 396 Many of the Remount officers were drawn from the landed gentry, masters of fox hounds and others who had experience with horses in civilian life, thus avoiding withdrawing Army officers from their normal duties. Such Remount officers included the well known artists Alfred Munnings, Cecil Aldin and Lionel Edwards. A Base Remount Depot and two Advanced Remount Depots went to France with the British Expeditionary Force in 1914 and were subsequently supplemented by two further Base Remount Depots at the Channel Ports. At the peak of operations, these had an establishment of 16,000 to 17,000 animals. Depots were set up in Egypt and Salonika for the campaigns in those regions. Animals for these areas were originally obtained from Australia (horses) and North America (mules) although, owing to difficulties with transport, all animals were later supplied from Britain. The supply of animals for the Mesopotamian Campaign was undertaken by the Indian Government. Over the course of the war, a total of 468,323 horses were purchased in the United Kingdom, 428,608 horses and 275,097 mules in North America, 6,000 horses and 1,500 mules came from South America, and 3,700 mules from Spain and Portugal.War Office (1922) p 396 Between 1914 and 1920, the Remount Service spent ¬£67.5 million on the purchase and training of these animals. There was initial concern that the neutrality of the United States might prevent the purchase of animals in that country, but this proved not to be the case and remount purchasing delegations were set up in Kansas City, St Louis, Chicago, Fort Worth and Denver.Singleton (1993) pp 186-187 In addition to the British Army, the British Remount Service supplied animals to the Belgian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and Portuguese armies, and even the American Expeditionary Force.Singleton (1993) p 188 Later years The mechanization of the British Army during the 1930s substantially reduced the Army's need for horses in the Second World War, although mules were still used as pack animals in rough terrain, particularly in Burma and Italy. However, the number of animals required was relatively small and in 1942 the Army Remount Service was amalgamated into the Army Veterinary and Remount Service.Ministry of Defence: RAVC Detailed History See also *British cavalry during the First World War References Bibliography * Moore-Colyer, Richard (1995) Aspects of Horse Breeding and the Supply of Horses in Victorian Britain.

Much of this seaside form has been destroyed by mining, tourist development or housing. It is threatened by extinction in the near future. 90% of the 433 sites are less than ten hectares in size. Littoral rainforest amounts to 0.6% of the rainforests in New South Wales. The littoral rainforests of Australia extends from North Queensland to Victoria and many offshore islands, with a minority found within New South Wales.http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi- bin/sprat/public/publicshowcommunity.pl?id=76&status;=Critically+Endangered  Description and location  Usually seen within 2 kilometres of the coast, from Mimosa Rocks National Park in the south to the border with the state of Queensland. the forest has a closed canopy of around 70% shade. Trees may be up to 30 metres tall in sheltered sites. But it is more often seen 5 to 15 metres tall. This forest type has been considered a form of sub-tropical rainforest, as only a few rainforest species are restricted to littoral sites.  Plant species  Plants often have thick and leathery leaves, as a protection against sea winds. Vines are common. Tree species are often from the following botanical families: Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Sapindaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, & Rutaceae. Salt tolerant species such as Plum Pine, Tuckeroo, Red Fruited Olive Plum, Black Apple, Mock Olive and Bolwarra are often encountered. Endangered species include the Coast Fontainea and the Scented Acronychia. Ferns are less often seen than in nearby sub-tropical rainforests. Non rainforest species are occasionally seen in these forests, such as the Coast Banksia (Banksia integrifolia) and Bangalay (Eucalyptus botryoides).  Environmental factors  The rainforest grows on beach sand, quartz-rich sediments, meta-sediments or on coastal headlands enriched by volcanic minerals. Sea winds add fertility to the sandy soils, with air borne minerals such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus. Relative humidity is high, and the climate is equable with higher minimum temperatures than further inland. Rainfall is generally over one metre per year. Salt scalding from the sea winds often produces an even and dense canopy. Weeds are a threat to the remaining areas. Biting insects and ticks, dense foliage and a variety of reptiles has not endeared this habitat to modern humans.  Examples  Examples of this rainforest type may be found from as far south as Mimosa Rocks National Park, Seven Mile Beach, Burning Palms and Barrenjoey. Further north it is preserved at sites such as Sea Acres National Park, Broken Head Nature Reserve, and Brunswick Heads Nature Reserve. The largest littoral rainforest in NSW is at Iluka Nature Reserve which is part of the World Heritage Site Gondwana Rainforests of Australia inscribed in 1986 and added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2007.

Gameplay In D-Pad Hero player use buttons on the controller to hit falling notes in sync with music. D-Pad Hero is played as a rhythm game. Notes fall from the top to the bottom of the screen in sync with music. As they reach a threshold players hit buttons on the controller which correspond with the note. If the player hits the correct button sequence at the right moment the guitar track in the song will continue to play. If the note is missed the guitar track will silence until the player successfully hits a note. This is similar to the Guitar Hero and Rock Band video game series, in which notes appear on a virtual highway which progressively moves lower onto the screen. The games feature chiptune versions of popular rock songs such as Guns N' Roses' \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", Michael Jackson's \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", Megadeth's \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", and Elvis Presley's \\"Burning Love\\". Wired.com's Chris Kohler noted that the game's learning curve is quite steep, and that upon its release it better served as \\"more of a curiosity.\\" The game also features a listen mode which allows players to listen to the song and watch the notes progress without playing.

He played college football at the University of Michigan from 1969 to 1971. He also played professional football for the Calgary Stampeders in the Canadian Football League from 1972 to 1973. He later worked for 21 years for the University of Michigan Athletic Department, retiring in 2000 as the executive associate athletic director. University of Michigan A native of Darien, Connecticut, Seyferth was reportedly \\"a good, but not great football player\\" in high school. In 1968, he enrolled at the University of Michigan as an engineering student and not as a scholarship athlete. He tried out for the Michigan Wolverines football team as a walk-on and made the roster of the 1969 team led by first-year head coach Bo Schembechler. He ultimately earned a scholarship as well. Seyferth started seven games at fullback and one at left halfback for the 1970 Michigan team that finished the season with a 9-1 record and ranked No. 7 and No. 9 in the final UPI and AP polls. On October 3, 1970, in Michigan's 14-7 victory over Texas A&M;, he gained 45 yards on seven carries during the game-winning drive in the fourth quarter. Three weeks later, on October 24, 1970, he scored four touchdowns in a 39-13 victory over Minnesota. He finished the 1970 season with 333 rushing yards and scored eight touchdowns, including two touchdown catches. He ranked third in the Big Ten Conference in scoring. Following the 1970 season, Seyferth won accolades for the work ethic that allowed him to progress from a walk-on to one of the top scorers in the Big Ten. Bo Schembechler noted, \\"It's pretty obvious he wants to play. His determination is something to see\\". John Hannen, sports editor of the Toledo Blade, wrote: > Seyferth responds to a challenge and he wants very badly to play football > ... It's like David conquering Goliath all over again. It's great, that's > what it is.\\" As a senior, Seyferth started all 12 games for the 1971 Michigan team that finished the regular season with a perfect 11-0 record before losing by one point to Stanford in the 1972 Rose Bowl. The Rose Bowl was Seyferth's final game for Michigan, and he scored the Wolverines' only touchdown on a one-yard run in the fourth quarter. Seyferth's touchdown gave Michigan a 10-3 lead, but Stanford scored 10 points in the fourth quarter and won the game. With the development of Billy Taylor as a star in 1971, Seyferth's role at fullback was principally as a blocker. He helped lead the way as Taylor rushed for 1,297 yards and became Michigan's all-time career leader in rushing yardage. Seyferth also rushed for 194 yards and five touchdowns on 55 carries.(To retrieve Marsh's statistics, enter \\"seyferth\\" in the space for \\"Enter last name\\" and \\"fritz\\" in the space for \\"Enter first name.\\") While attending Michigan, Seyferth served as the treasurer of the Druids Senior Literary Society and maintained a \\"consistently high grade point average\\" in Michigan's engineering program while also competing in football. In December 1972, Seyferth received the Besser-Lindsey Award from Sigma Alpha Epsilon \\"in recognition of achievement in scholarship, fraternity and athletics.\\" Professional football Seyferth was drafted by the New York Giants in the 17th round (419th overall pick) of the 1972 NFL Draft. He remained part of the Giants team during the 1972 pre-season and exhibition games, but he was cut at the end of August, before the start of the regular season. He was then signed by the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. In his first game for Calgary on September 10, 1972, he gained 38 rushing yards, caught five passes for 72 yards and scored a touchdown. He also was credited with \\"80 hard earned yards and some crunching blocks\\" in an October 1, 1972 victory over the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He finished the 1972 season as the Stampeders' second leading rusher with 283 yards on 67 carries. He also caught 16 passes for 216 yards. He continued to play for the Stampeders in 1973, but retired from professional football at the end of the season.(\\"A draft choice of the New York Giants, Seyferth retired from professional football after a two-year stint with the Calgary Stampeders ...\\") Later years Seyferth was married to Lynn Groves in 1973. They met while both were students at the University of Michigan. After retiring from football, Seyferth worked for Arthur Young & Company. He later returned to Ann Arbor and worked for the University of Michigan Athletic Department for 21 years. He was the recruiting director for the Michigan football team in the 1980s and led the campaign to raise $12 million for the program's new building. He later served as Michigan's assistant athletic director during the 1990s. In 1998, he became the No. 2 person in Michigan's athletic department.

Plot summary The box includes six poster-sized maps, half of which are tactical displays of village and battlefield settings, while the rest detail the three-levels of the mountain's interior. Six cardstock mini-maps show self-contained sections of the mountain that can be attached to the poster maps at various locations or simply set aside. The new Monstrous Compendium pages showcase several opponents, such as the gnasher and the brain spider. Book One outlines the search for a map to Dragon Mountain, a plane-shifting construct that appears in a random location every couple of decades, and a magical item that will improve the party's chance of survival once they get inside. The hunt takes the player characters to a variety of sites, such as crypt of dancing wights and a snake-infested swamp. Books Two and Three lead the characters through the city-sized labyrinth of Dragon Mountain, a maze of traps, ambushes, and dead ends. The adventure concludes with a journey through foggy ruins that leads to the home of the dragon.

Reid, with illustrations by Tony DiTerlizzi, Larry Elmore, and Jeff Easley and cover by Jennell Jaquays. Reception Rick Swan reviewed Dragon Mountain for Dragon magazine #200 (December 1993). According to Swan, \\"Dungeon-crawlers will think they've died and gone to heaven when they visit Dragon Mountain, a city-sized labyrinth that revitalizes the AD&D; game's hoariest conventions. It's a funhouse of foul-tempered monsters and convoluted traps, designed for characters with the stamina of Greek gods and an appetite for abuse. Best of all, it boasts one of the nastiest, sneakiest surprises I've ever seen in a fantasy adventure\\" which involves hundreds of \\"one of the game's most underused and underappreciated adversaries\\". He felt that \\"A project this ambitious deserves a lavish package, and the designers deliver in spades,\\" calling the documents, diagrams, and other player handouts \\"fun\\". He compliments the designers, stating that \\"Paul Lidberg and Colin McComb opt for clean, no-frill prose, making it easy for the DM to track the serpentine plot. Every encounter makes sense, quite an accomplishment for a dungeon this size.\\" Swan felt that Book One, written by Lidberg, which was all prologue to actually reaching the Dragon Mountain, involves \\"a variety of interesting sites\\" that results in \\"an engaging mix of investigative and combat encounters\\" where the PCs \\"acquire key information in imaginative ways\\". He noted that the \\"cast of eccentric NPCs makes for lively role-playing\\" with \\"quirky behavior\\" from some of these characters, although he complains that too many non-player characters \\"remain cardboard cutouts, with more attention paid to their physical traits than their personalities. If we knew as much about their motivations as their eye color, Book One would‚Äôve been more memorable.\\" Swan complains that as the PCs \\"drift from one lead to the next, the obstacles become increasingly contrived\\", which he feels \\"isn't so much a problem with the writing as with the structure itself; Book One is all prologue, and prologues shouldn't take up a third of the adventure.\\" By comparison, Swan considered that \\"the main event is worth the wait as Books Two and Three, both by McComb, lead us through a delightfully sadistic maze of traps, ambushes, and (literal) dead ends.\\" He felt that Dragon Mountain \\"boasts a rich selection\\" of encounters, and \\"makes expert use of layered encounters, where the PCs must deal with two or more perils simultaneously.\\" He considered \\"the inevitable showdown with the Queen of the Mountain\\" to be \\"somewhat of a letdown, dribbling away in unconvincing parley and an inconclusive climax. I think McComb just ran out of room; he needed another half-dozen pages or so to wrap it up in style.\\" Swan concluded the review by saying: \\"Dragon Mountain demands more of players, especially newcomers, than they may be willing to give. The relentless assault, particularly in Book Three, can become oppressive if the DM doesn't give the party a few lucky breaks. Serious-minded players may scoff at the cartoonish embellishments; this is a dungeon stocked with greased slides and bad guys called Kneebiters. The presentation has a few ragged edges: underdeveloped encounters [...] sketchy DM tips [...] and a too-long Book One. But, even at shakiest, Dragon Mountain rarely fails to thrill. It's a testament to the skill of the designers that they can bring a smile to your face while they're knocking your teeth out.\\" Dragon Mountain won the 1993 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Adventure.

He was initially a trusted general under Yan's only emperor Liu Shouguang, but after his capture in battle by Jin forces, became a close associate of Jin's prince Li Cunxu (the later Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang). After Emperor Zhuangzong was killed in a mutiny in 926, Xingqin was captured by and executed by Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan (the later Emperor Mingzong) for having killed Li Siyuan's son Li Congshen (ÊùéÂæûÂØ©, also known as Li Jijing (ÊùéÁπºÁíü)).  Background and service during Yan  It is not known when Yuan Xingqin was born, but it is known that he was from You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing). He was initially an officer under Liu Shouguang, one of the sons of Liu Rengong, a late Tang Dynasty warlord who ruled Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered at You Prefecture).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 25. In 907, while Liu Rengong was at his retreat mansion at Mount Da'an (Â§ßÂÆâÂ±±), the Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) general Li Si'an (ÊùéÊÄùÂÆâ) attacked You Prefecture; Liu Shouguang, whom Liu Rengong had expelled out of his household for having an affair with his concubine Lady Luo, took the opportunity to take over the defense of You and repelled Li's attack. He then sent Yuan and another officer, Li Xiaoxi (ÊùéÂ∞èÂñú), to attack Liu Rengong at Mount Da'an, defeating and capturing him. He put Liu Rengong under house arrest and took over the circuit,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. and had Yuan kill all of his (Liu Shouguang's) brothers for him. Liu Shouguang initially nominally submitted to the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit, Zhu Quanzhong, including after Zhu seized the Tang throne and established the Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. Meanwhile, Liu Shouguang's brother Liu Shouwen, whom Liu Rengong had made the military governor of Yichang Circuit (Áæ©Êòå, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), launched a campaign to try to free their father. In 909, Liu Shouwen, allied with Khitan and Tuyuhun tribal troops, made a major attack on Liu Shouguang and defeated him in battle, but as he stood out in front his own troops, instructing them not to kill Liu Shouguang, Yuan saw him and charged toward him, capturing him. This caused Liu Shouwen's troops to collapse, and next year Yichang, under the defense of Liu Shouwen's son Liu Yanzuo, surrendered to Liu Shouguang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. In 913, by which time Liu Shouguang had declared himself emperor of an independent state of Yan and was subsequently under attack from the joint forces of Jin, Zhao, and Yiwu Circuit (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Liu Shouguang sent Yuan north of the Yan Mountains to try to recruit reinforcement troops and encourage aid from the Khitan, as well to allow the warhorses to feed. Subsequently, the Jin general Li Siyuan (adoptive brother to Jin's prince Li Cunxu) attacked the region. The Yan general Gao Xinggui (È´òË°åÁè™) the prefect of Wu Prefecture (Ê≠¶Â∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei) surrendered to Li Siyuan. When Yuan heard this, he counterattacked and put Wu Prefecture under siege. Li Siyuan came to Gao's aid, and Yuan withdrew. Li Siyuan gave chase,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. after eight battles in which Yuan was hit with arrows seven times but continued to battle, and was able to hit Li Siyuan with an arrow once, he ran out of strength and surrendered to Li Siyuan. Li Siyuan was impressed by Yuan's bravery, invited Yuan to a feast, and subsequently took Yuan into his army and made him an adoptive son.  During Jin  In the subsequent campaigns that Li Siyuan conducted, Yuan Xingqin often followed him and fought well, such that he became well known in the Jin army. This attracted Li Cunxu's attention, and as Li Cunxu was trying to build a corps of elite guards around him,History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 70. in or around 915, Li Cunxu requested Li Siyuan to send Yuan to him. Li Siyuan, albeit reluctant to give Yuan up, did so, and Li Cunxu made him a guard commander and bestowed on him the imperial surname of Li, as well as a new name of Shaorong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. As, during his campaigns against archrival Later Liang, Li Cunxu liked to personally engage in battles, he was often putting himself in danger, and Li Shaorong had to save him on several occasions.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In a particular battle at Panzhang (ÊΩòÂºµ, in modern Puyang, Henan) in 919, Li Cunxu became surrounded by several hundred Later Liang soldiers, but Li Shaorong, from afar, saw that his royal flag was surrounded, and fought into the encirclement to rescue him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. After Li Cunxu was able to safely return to camp, he wept and stated to Li Shaorong, \\"I will share the honors and treasures with you.\\" It was said that after that battle, Li Cunxu favored Li Shaorong over all other officers. He gave Li Shaorong the honorary title of acting Taifu (Â§™ÂÇÖ) and made him the prefect of Xin Prefecture (ÂøªÂ∑û, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), although Li Shaorong appeared to continue to serve in his guard troops and never reported to Xin.  During Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself the emperor of a new Later Tang (as its Emperor Zhuangzong). Later that year, he captured Later Liang's capital Daliang, and Later Liang's final emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. He made Li Shaorong the military governor (Jiedushi) of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). On one occasion, he held a feast for imperial officials inside the palace. As Li Shaorong's main office was not as high as some of the other officials attending, he had to sit outside the main group of feast attendees. During the feast, Emperor Zhuangzong began describing some of the anecdotes of the events of his campaigns; he looked around, not seeing Li Shaorong, and then stated, \\"Where is Li Shaorong?\\" The official responsible for the feast seating responded, \\"The imperial edict stated that this was a feast for the Shixiang [(‰ΩøÁõ∏, i.e., military governors who carried honorary chancellor titles)]. Li Shaorong's title did not fall within the group, and therefore he does not have a seat in the hall.\\" Emperor Zhuangzong was displeased, and the next day bestowed the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã) on Li Shaorong. It was also said that after this incident, he no longer held feasts for all officials, but only held feasts for officials who came from army ranks. In 924, when the Anyi Circuit (ÂÆâÁæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) officer Yang Li (Ê•äÁ´ã) mutinied and took control of its capital Lu Prefecture (ÊΩûÂ∑û), Emperor Zhuangzong sent Li Siyuan to command the troops against the Anyi mutineers, with Li Shaorong and the officer Zhang Tingyun (ÂºµÂª∑Ëòä) serving as his deputies. Zhang was able to quickly arrive at Lu and surprise the mutineers, capturing them and quelling the rebellion, before Li Siyuan and Li Shaorong could arrive, however.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. After the Anyi campaign, Emperor Zhuangzong made Li Shaorong the military governor of Guide Circuit (Ê≠∏Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan), but kept him at the capital Luoyang to command the imperial guards, and continued to treat him well, often visiting Li Shaorong's home with his mother Empress Dowager Cao and/or wife Empress Liu. When Li Shaorong's wife died in 925, Emperor Zhuangzong, while Li Shaorong was on duty in the palace, stated to him, \\"Do you plan to remarry? I will make the marriage proposal on your behalf.\\" At that time, however, Empress Liu was jealous of a beautiful imperial consort whom Emperor Zhuangzong favored at the time and who had borne an imperial prince, so she pointed at the consort and stated, \\"If Your Imperial Majesty pities Shaorong, why not give her to him?\\" Emperor Zhuangzong was unable to immediately refuse, and the empress told Li Shaorong to get up and thank the emperor and then take the consort home. Emperor Zhuangzong was sufficiently displeased that he did not eat well for several days, but did not show the displeasure against Li Shaorong.  Involvement in the events of 926  In 926, after the major general Guo Chongtao was killed on Empress Liu's orders (but Emperor Zhuangzong thereafter affirmed the orders), the soldiers over the realm were displeased, and there were many mutinies in the Later Tang realm. One of the mutinies was at the major city Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei), which concerned Emperor Zhuangzong. He initially was set to send the general Li Shaoqin to combat the mutiny, but Li Shaoqin (a former Later Liang general) drew his suspicions by selecting, on his staff, a large number of former Later Liang officers whom he favored, such that Emperor Zhuangzong cancelled Li Shaoqin's commission. At Empress Liu's suggestion, he sent Li Shaorong instead with 3,000 soldiers but the authorities to requisition soldiers from nearby circuits. When Li Shaorong arrived at Yedu, he initially tried to persuade the mutineers to surrender by informing them that the emperor would pardon them, but when the eunuch army monitor Shi Yanqiong (Âè≤ÂΩ•Áìä) cursed at the mutineers, the mutineers believed that they would not be spared, and so continued to resist, and Li Shaorong was unable to defeat them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. Emperor Zhuangzong considered heading to Yedu himself, but most of the official opposed, believing that he needed to stay at Luoyang so that the situation would not appear out of control. Instead, most officials recommend that he send Li Siyuan, as Li Siyuan was the most senior officer in the imperial army at the time. Emperor Zhuangzong, after some reluctance, agreed. When Li Siyuan's army got to Yedu, however, his soldiers mutinied as well and forced him to join the Yedu mutineers. Li Shaorong, seeing the situation, withdrew, and reported to Emperor Zhuangzong that Li Siyuan also mutinied. Li Siyuan, who had regained control of his army subsequently, tried to send letters to Emperor Zhuangzong proclaiming his continued loyalty, but the letters were intercepted by Li Shaorong and not delivered to the emperor. Further, when Emperor Zhuangzong, under belief that Li Siyuan had rebelled but was doing so under stress, tried to send Li Siyuan's son Li Congshen, who was serving as an imperial guard officer, to Li Siyuan to try to persuade him to get his father to resubmit. When Li Congshen got underway, however, Li Shaorong intercepted him and initially wanted to kill him, only sparing him when Li Congshen offered to return to Luoyang to defend the emperor. (Emperor Zhuangzong subsequently adopted Li Congshen as a son, changing his name to Li Jijing.) With his communications with Emperor Zhuangzong cut off, Li Siyuan decided to act against Emperor Zhuangzong by taking Daliang. Meanwhile, Li Shaorong returned to Luoyang and also encouraged Emperor Zhuangzong to head east to secure Daliang and not allow the mutineers to seize it. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed. While heading toward Daliang, he again tried to send Li Jijing to Li Siyuan to try to reestablish communications. However, when Li Jijing headed toward Li Siyuan's camp, he was again intercepted by Li Shaorong, who executed him. Li Siyuan was able to capture Daliang before Emperor Zhuangzong could arrive. Thwarted, Emperor Zhuangzong returned to Luoyang. Depressed at the turn of events, he turned to Li Shaorong and the other imperial guard officers, stating, \\"Ever since you started serving me, we have shared both disasters and fortunes together. Now I have reached this point. Does none of you have an idea how to save me?\\" Li Shaorong thereafter led a group of officers in cutting off their hair and swearing continued loyalty. Some officials suggested that Emperor Zhuangzong take control of the banks of Si River (Ê±úÊ∞¥, flowing through modern Zhengzhou, Henan) and wait for reinforcement (in the form of an army commanded by his son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei, who was returning from former Former Shu territory after Later Tang had conquered Former Shu in 925). Emperor Zhuangzong agreed. However, before he could depart Luoyang, the officer Guo Congqian (ÈÉ≠ÂæûË¨ô) mutinied at Luoyang, and in the ensuing battle, Emperor Zhuangzong was killed by a stray arrow. Li Shaorong fled the capital, initially with Empress Liu and Emperor Zhuangzong's brother Li Cunwo (ÊùéÂ≠òÊ∏•) the Prince of Shen, but apparently soon departed from them, for he was then described to be heading toward Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) to join another brother of Emperor Zhuangzong's, Li Cunba (ÊùéÂ≠òÈú∏) the Prince of Yong, but on the way, his soldiers abandoned him except for several cavalry soldiers. When he reached Pinglu (Âπ≥Èô∏, in modern Yuncheng), the local officials arrested him, broke his legs, and delivered him to Luoyang (which Li Siyuan, by that point, had taken control of, and claimed the title of regent). When Li Shaorong arrived at Luoyang, Li Siyuan personally rebuked him, asking him, \\"How have I wronged you that you killed my son?\\" Li Shaorong stared at Li Siyuan and responded, \\"How has the deceased emperor wronged you?\\" Li Siyuan ordered him executed by decapitation, and changed his name back to Yuan Xingqin.

Unlike most forms of pow wow dancing, the grass dance regalia generally has no feathers besides the occasional roach feather. The regalia consists of brightly colored fringe made of either yarn, broadcloth, or ribbon. Origins The original creators of the grass dance and the purpose of the dance are widely contested. Sources attribute possible origins to the Omaha, Pawnee, Anishnabe people, Ponca, Dakota, or Winnebago tribes. While the specific tribe of origin is unknown, it is generally accepted as a Northern Plains dance that was used by warrior societies. There are several stories behind the origins of the grass dance. One is that a medicine man told a handicapped boy to seek inspiration in the prairie. There he observed the swaying of the grass and received a vision of himself dancing the same style as the grass. When he shared this vision with his village, the use of his legs was returned to him and he performed the first grass dance. Other origins attribute the grass dance to scouts blessing and flattening the grass for a ceremony, dance, or battle. The dancers would also then tie braided grass into their belts. Tying grass to the belt is believed to have led to the yarn and ribbons common today. Description Grass dancer at the 2005 National Pow Wow. The grass dance is a fast paced dance consisting of sweeping motions and symmetry. It is generally faster than Northern Tradition or Straight style dancing, but not as fast as a Fancy dance. Like with most pow wow dances, the dancer brings his foot down to tap or step on the drum beat. Whatever the grass dancer does on one side of his body, he must also do that on the other side to create symmetry and mimic waving grass. Wide sweeping motions and tapping are also used to imitate laying down the grass. Other movements show a warrior stalking the enemy or game through tall grass. One dance steps typical of this involves one foot being firmly planted on the ground while the rest of the body moves around it. This is said to show a warrior still fighting when one foot has been staked down. The main difference between grass dance regalia and the regalia of the other pow wow styles is that there are very few if any feathers compared to bustles of most men's dances. The regalia of the grass dancer instead consists of brightly colored fringe made of yarn or ribbon. While most dances involve making the bustle move, the grass dancer is instead intent on the swaying of the fringe. The dancer wears a roach headdress with either one to two feathers or two fluff antennae. A fully or partially beaded set consists of an \\"H-Harness\\" (two long suspenders that hang to below the knees and a belt), cuffs, headband, and side tabs. Grass dancers normally carry feather fans, mirror board, scarves, dream catchers, hoops, or dance sticks.

Contents Earth, Air, Fire, and Water expands the role of the cleric in the Dark Sun setting by adding new goals, duties, and abilities. As detailed in the Dark Sun Boxed Set rules, Athasian clerics do not worship gods, but instead receive spells from the four elemental planes. Earth, Air, Fire, and Water clarifies this premise, explaining that clerics form pacts with elemental entities who demand absolute devotion and obedience. Most clerics fill one of four roles in the campaign world, serving as Wanderers (wilderness advocates of the underprivileged), Guardians of the Shrine (protectors of sacred edifices), Priests of the Cities (urban dwellers, friends of the common man), or Shamans (mysterious primitives). Each has his own responsibilities and specialties. A cleric's race also affects his role; mul clerics tend to work with Air entities, thri-kreen priests are mostly Shamans and Wanderers, working with any elemental powers but Fire. When clerics reach 20th level, they have two options: they may continue to advance in level, or they may become elementals. Clerics who continue to advance gain access to the powerful Sphere of the Cosmos. They also tap into the para-elemental planes of Silt, Sun, Rain, and Magma, which grant powerful abilities. Clerics who become elementals leave their humanity behind, relocating to the inner planes. Two chapters briefly address druids and templars. A druid forms a pact with the elemental powers, much the same as a cleric, though he is denied the cleric's granted powers. He also must choose between humanity and elemental transformation (becoming a ‚Äúspirit of the land‚Äù) when he reaches 20th level. A templar draws magic from the elemental planes, but must funnel his request through a sorcerer-king rather than contact the entities directly. A selection of new spells rounds out the book. Publication history Earth, Air, Fire, and Water was published as a 96-page book by TSR, Inc. Design was by Shane Lacy Hensley, editing was by Doug Stewart, the cover was by Brom and illustrations by Tom Baxa and Brom. Reception Rick Swan reviewed Earth, Air, Fire, and Water for Dragon magazine #206 (June 1994). He felt that \\"cleric characters got the shaft in the original Dark Sun set\\", while wizards and fighters got special advantages, but \\"clerics were saddled with frustrating weapon and spell restrictions. Their special powers didn't amount to much, either. [...] Earth, Air, Fire, and Water (EAFW) changes all that.\\" Calling it a \\"top-to-bottom touch-up\\", he concluded that \\"EAFW transforms the stodgy Dark Sun cleric into the setting's most intriguing character. It turns out those Earth clerics can do a lot more than play with rocks.\\" He felt that the book \\"shifts into high gear when clerics reach 20th level\\". He complained about the brief chapters for druids and templars: \\"At seven and six pages respectively, the druid and templar chapters seem like afterthoughts; these guys deserve their own volumes.\\" Swan concluded the review by saying: Earth, Air, Fire, and Water is so stuffed with ideas that it may take a while for referees to figure out which material best suits their campaigns. With all their granted powers, high-level clerics may find the encounters in a typical adventure a bit too easy. The deck seems stacked against the Water cleric; he has to empty his canteen to recharge his spells, a tough requirement considering the chronic water shortage in Athas. Still, for players who've thus far avoided Athasian clerics, EAFW is a revelation. It's spoiled me‚ÄîI don't see how a credible Dark Sun campaign could be run without it.

Located on the corner of King Street and Auckland Street, it was designed by architect Emil Sodersten in association with local architectural practice Pitt and Merewether. An example of Art Deco style, the design was inspired by the streamlined functionalism of contemporary architecture in Europe. The building was constructed between 1937 and 1939 for the Newcastle Electricity Supply Council Administration and was originally known as N.E.S.C.A House. The interior, designed by Guy Allbut, originally comprised a demonstration theatre, showroom, offices and staff accommodation. In 1959, when Shortland County Council became responsible for electricity supply in the Hunter Region, they constructed a three-storey extension at the back of the building. A tower was added in 1967 and remodelling was carried out in 1969 and 1970. After the council vacated the building in 1987, a radio station and an architectural practice moved in. The building only sustained cosmetic damage during the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. In 1995, the University of Newcastle established a library there. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  In 1890, Newcastle City Council began to generate electricity for street lighting, moving in 1892 to establish a district supply, providing electricity to other neighbouring councils and to private consumers.Collins, 1990, 3 With the opening of BHP Steelworks in 1915, industrial development stimulated population growth in the area resulting in an increasing demand for power. By 1937, the Council's Electricity Department \\"was providing over 87 million kilowatt hours of power and attracting annual revenue of ¬£450,000\\". Outgrowing its office space in Newcastle City Hall, council decided, in 1937, to construct a separate administrative centre for the Electricity Department, to be situated adjacent to the Town Hall.Collins, 1990; 3 Selected by the delegates, Mayor, Alderman H. Fenton and Electrical Engineer, Guy Allbut, Emil Sodersteen (his name was changed to Sodersten by deed poll in 1941), who in 1927 achieved national prominence by winning the design competition for the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, was chosen as the architect to design the new building. His associates on the project were to be local architects, Pitt and Merewether. The new building was to be designed to complement the Town Hall (designed by theatre architect, H.E White) which was constructed in 1929. However, the building had to have a modern design, as electricity was still relatively novel in the 1930s and the building needed to embody the concept of progress through electricity. Thus, it would have been unthinkable for the Council's electricity administration centre to have been more traditional in design.Collins (1990; 4) The new building would \\"be modern, efficient, timesaving and functional\\", pulling together the city's many electrical departments into one building.Collins, 1990; 4 The building was to house a demonstration theatre, showroom, administrative and business offices and staff accommodation. N.E.S.C.A House marks a new era in the architecture of Sodersten, his disillusionment with the skyscraper leading him to draw on English perspectives and European functional modernism for his future designs. The interior decoration and layout of N.E.S.C.A House had much to do with Guy Allbut, who had toured American electrical facilities. Allbut was very taken with American perspectives and was a defining influence on the interior of the building. Construction began in 1937 and, after significant delays due to water on the site and difficulty in obtaining the correct steel sections, the building was opened on 8 September 1938 by Hon. E.S. Spooner, former Minister for Works and Local Government. In 1959 Shortland County Council assumed control of power supplies for the Hunter Region. In their new role they oversaw the construction of a three-story addition to the rear of N.E.S.C.A House. During their tenure they also added a decorative tower in 1967 and in 1969 the theatre and demonstration centre were remodelled. Further remodelling occurred in 1970 when two floors were added to the 1959 addition and the original council chamber was revitalised for new purposes. In 1979, in a move deplored by the National Trust, the curved windows were removed from the front of the building. The sandstone facing was also cleaned and re-caulked with silicone. The Shortland County Council occupied the building until 1987, when the Council moved operations to Wallsend. In 1989, the building was used by Newcastle FM radio and by Suters Architects Snell, using the ground floor in 1990. In 1995 the University of Newcastle established a library in the building. N.E.S.C.A House also houses collections of the Conservatorium: School of Music and Drama. More recently the building has also become the Graduate School of Business and the Newcastle Legal Centre. Currently known as \\"University House\\", the building now accommodates the University of Newcastle Legal Centre, the Newcastle Business School and the Watt Space Gallery. The exterior of the building appeared in the 2006 film Superman Returns as \\"\\"Newhart Federal Bank\\"\\", the scene of a bank robbery.  Description  Side view N.E.S.C.A House was designed, by Emil Sodersten, on contemporary English lines in keeping with the work of Wells Coates and George Coles.Collins, 1990; p5 Described as having a \\"heavy, streamlined form\\", the \\"new style was the streamlined functionalism of leading European architects\\". Structural drawings show the main buildings framework to be of concrete encased structural steel with mild steel reinforcing rods used throughout the structure. Concrete floors and some secondary floor beams appear to have been cast in-situ and were specified to use normal Portland cement, sand and course aggregate.Collins, 1990; p26 It was reported to be in good condition as at 20 May 2009, although some of the significant fabric is in need of repair or maintenance.Collins, 1990; 28 Some of the original fabric has also been removed or relocated.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries NESCA House is of state significance as an outstanding Art Deco building by the architect Emil Sodersten. The House is evidence of Newcastle's shift from a coal port to a heavy industry city. It is also intimately linked to perceptions of electricity in the 1930s as a novel energy source that was the way of the future. The Art Deco style, rather than a more traditional building, is a reflection of these perceptions. Nesca House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. NESCA House is of State significance as evidence of the development of Newcastle from a coal port into a heavy industry city and the subsequent increase in importance to the State's economy. The House is of State significance as evidence of the historical integration of electricity into society and the notion of \\"progress through electricity\\".
