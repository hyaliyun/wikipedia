Overview The term semifield has two conflicting meanings, both of which include fields as a special case. * In projective geometry and finite geometry (MSC 51A, 51E, 12K10), a semifield is a nonassociative division ring with multiplicative identity element. More precisely, it is a nonassociative ring whose nonzero elements form a loop under multiplication. In other words, a semifield is a set S with two operations + (addition) and ¬∑ (multiplication), such that ** (S,+) is an abelian group, ** multiplication is distributive on both the left and right, ** there exists a multiplicative identity element, and ** division is always possible: for every a and every nonzero b in S, there exist unique x and y in S for which b¬∑x = a and y¬∑b = a. : Note in particular that the multiplication is not assumed to be commutative or associative. A semifield that is associative is a division ring, and one that is both associative and commutative is a field. A semifield by this definition is a special case of a quasifield. If S is finite, the last axiom in the definition above can be replaced with the assumption that there are no zero divisors, so that a*b = 0 implies that a = 0 or b = 0. Note that due to the lack of associativity, the last axiom is not equivalent to the assumption that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse, as is usually found in definitions of fields and division rings. * In ring theory, combinatorics, functional analysis, and theoretical computer science (MSC 16Y60), a semifield is a semiring (S,+,¬∑) in which all nonzero elements have a multiplicative inverse. These objects are also called proper semifields. A variation of this definition arises if S contains an absorbing zero that is different from the multiplicative unit e, it is required that the non-zero elements be invertible, and a¬∑0 = 0¬∑a = 0. Since multiplication is associative, the (non-zero) elements of a semifield form a group. However, the pair (S,+) is only a semigroup, i.e. additive inverse need not exist, or, colloquially, 'there is no subtraction'. Sometimes, it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative.  Primitivity of semifields A semifield D is called right (resp. left) primitive if it has an element w such that the set of nonzero elements of D* is equal to the set of all right (resp. left) principal powers of w.  Examples  We only give examples of semifields in the second sense, i.e. additive semigroups with distributive multiplication. Moreover, addition is commutative and multiplication is associative in our examples. * Positive rational numbers with the usual addition and multiplication form a commutative semifield. *:This can be extended by an absorbing 0. * Positive real numbers with the usual addition and multiplication form a commutative semifield. *:This can be extended by an absorbing 0, forming the probability semiring, which is isomorphic to the log semiring. * Rational functions of the form f /g, where f and g are polynomials in one variable with positive coefficients, form a commutative semifield. *:This can be extended to include 0. * The real numbers R can be viewed a semifield where the sum of two elements is defined to be their maximum and the product to be their ordinary sum; this semifield is more compactly denoted (R, max, +). Similarly (R, min, +) is a semifield. These are called the tropical semiring. *:This can be extended by ‚àí‚àû (an absorbing 0); this is the limit (tropicalization) of the log semiring as the base goes to infinity. * Generalizing the previous example, if (A,¬∑,‚â§) is a lattice-ordered group then (A,+,¬∑) is an additively idempotent semifield with the semifield sum defined to be the supremum of two elements. Conversely, any additively idempotent semifield (A,+,¬∑) defines a lattice-ordered group (A,¬∑,‚â§), where a‚â§b if and only if a + b = b. * The boolean semifield B = {0, 1} with addition defined by logical or, and multiplication defined by logical and.

Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability. Toyota adopted these three Japanese words as part of their product improvement program, due to their familiarity in common usage. Mura, in terms of business/process improvement, is avoided through Just-In-Time systems which are based on keeping little or no inventory. These systems supply the production process with the right part, at the right time, in the right amount, using first-in, first-out (FIFO) component flow. Just-In-Time systems create a ‚Äúpull system‚Äù in which each sub-process withdraws its needs from the preceding sub- processes, and ultimately from an outside supplier. When a preceding process does not receive a request or withdrawal it does not make more parts. This type of system is designed to maximize productivity by minimizing storage overhead. For example: # The assembly line ‚Äúmakes a request to,‚Äù or ‚Äúpulls from‚Äù the Paint Shop, which pulls from Body Weld. # The Body Weld shop pulls from Stamping. # At the same time, requests are going out to suppliers for specific parts, for the vehicles that have been ordered by customers. # Small buffers accommodate minor fluctuations, yet allow continuous flow. If parts or material defects are found in one process, the Just-in-Time approach requires that the problem be quickly identified and corrected.  Implementation  Production leveling, also called heijunka, and frequent deliveries to customer are key to identifying and eliminating Mura. The use of different types of Kanban to control inventory at different stages in the process are key to ensuring that \\"pull\\" is happening between sub-processes. Leveling production, even when different products are produced in the same system, will aid in scheduling work in a standard way that encourages lower costs. It is also possible to smooth the workflow by having one operator work across several machines in a process rather than having different operators; in a sense merging several sub-processes under one operator. The fact that there is one operator will force a smoothness across the operations because the workpiece flows with the operator. There is no reason why the several operators cannot all work across these several machines following each other and carrying their workpiece with them. This multiple machine handling is called \\"multi-process handling\\" in the Toyota Production System.  Limitations, critiques and improvements  Some processes have considerable lead time. Some processes have unusually high costs for waiting or downtime. When this is the case, it is often desirable to try to predict the upcoming demand from a sub-process before pull occurs or a card is generated. The smoother the process, the more accurately this can be done from analysis of previous historical experience. Some processes have asymmetric cost. In such situations, it may be better to err away from the higher cost error. In this case, there appears to be waste and higher average error, but the waste or errors are smaller ones and in aggregate leads to lower costs / more customer value. For example, consider running a call center. It may be more effective to have low cost call center operators wait for high value clients rather than risk losing high value clients by making them wait. Given the asymmetric cost of these errors - particularly if the processes are not smooth - it may be prudent to have what seems like a surplus of call center operators that appear to be \\"wasting\\" call center operator time, rather than commit the higher-cost error of losing the occasional high value client.

It is best known as the western terminus of former King's Highway 20, now maintained by the City of Hamilton. It starts off as Upper Centennial Parkway, a mountain-access road in the City right before the Canadian Pacific Railway line at the backend of Battlefield Park and is a two-way street throughout that extends north over the Queen Elizabeth Way and ends at Beach Boulevard/ Van Wagners Beach Road in front of Confederation Park. History In the late 1920s, the Department of Highways assumed the route north of the Hamilton & Queenston Provincial Highway (Highway 8) as Provincial Highway 8A, a quick connector to Highway 2 via Hamilton Beach (the site of the current Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway bridge). It was renamed Highway 20 when the route connecting it to Niagara Falls was completed, and a traffic circle (bisected by a railway) was created for the intersection with the Queen Elizabeth Way, completed in 1939. A series of provincial downloads in the late 1990s saw the majority of Highway 20 downloaded to municipal and regional authorities; the City of Hamilton now maintains the entire route within its borders as (Upper) Centennial Parkway, or \\"Hamilton Highway 20\\". The Battle of Stoney Creek was fought on June 6, 1813, during the War of 1812 near present day Stoney Creek, Ontario. British units made a night attack on an American encampment. Due in large part to the capture of both American brigadier generals, and an overestimation of British strength by the Americans, the battle was a victory for the British, and a turning point in the defence of Upper Canada. Battlefield House, built in 1796, and fifteen and one-half acres of parkland, (Battlefield Park), was property of the Women's Wentworth Historical Society, (1899‚Äì1962), and given by this society to the Niagara Parks Commission as a National historical site on January 19, 1962. One can reach the Bruce Trail via Centennial Parkway South. From this point southwards the road is then known as Upper Centennial Parkway and is one of many mountain-access roads in the city. The Bruce trail cuts through Hamilton along the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) and used by many locals for a full days hike. The Trail is over 690 kilometres long and starts at Niagara Falls, passes through Hamilton and ends at the Bruce Peninsula. Hikers are led to scenic gorges, hidden waterfalls and places of quiet charm. Picnickers have an excellent choice of numerous parks in Hamilton. Confederation Park is a popular lakeside retreat for those who wish to pack a lunch and go. Camping facilities are also available for extended visits. The park also has playgrounds, beaches and Wild Waterworks, which features the largest outdoor wave pool in the world, waterslides, lazy river, batting cages, mini put and a picnic area.

When birth contractions begin, a mid wife who has mastery over sorcery, accompanies her. After delivery the women and the baby are declared unclean for six months. She leads a peaceful life without domestic work for three months, with the husband doing her usual tasks. Death: When a person dies, couriers travel throughout the hamlets, chanting the name of the dead. The relatives and the neighbors sprinkle coriander mixed with water on the dead body and a coin is pasted on the forehead. The dead body is completely covered with a white cloth and placed in a bamboo cot. The people who come for the burial service resolve any problems they had with the dead person and thus he is expected to be completely freed for his eternal journey. A whole day is spent dancing and singing, thanking god for letting the person live as long as they did. In that dance they show symbols that God gave and God took. Mudugar people do not cry when somebody dies. When the father dies, his first-born son tonsures his head and when the mother dies the second son tonsure his head. If there are no males in the family girls do so instead.

It stars Michael Schoeffling, Thomas F. Wilson, Glenn Frey, Rick Rossovich, Ben Johnson, Mark Harmon, Gary Busey, and Robert Duvall. The film direction is credited to Alan Smithee, a pseudonym used by directors who repudiate their involvement in a film. Plot In Colombia, an American engineer named Harry Burck is overseeing the opening of his company's water pipeline. In the middle of the unveiling ceremony, a group of rebels arrives to kidnap an American diplomat who is in attendance. In the process, Harry is also kidnapped. Word of the kidnapping reaches Harry's brother Corey and his friends Bob, Spence, and Kurt, who were all awaiting Harry's return. The men, coworkers at a factory, learn that Harry's kidnapping was orchestrated by a drug lord named Carlos Ochobar. Corey and Bob travel to Washington, D.C. to seek assistance from the U.S. government, only to be told that there are no plans to mount a rescue. Harry's father, Harry Burck, Sr., is despondent over the kidnapping of his son. Kurt reminds his friends that they all personally owe Harry something, and that their only choice is to rescue him themselves. Despite some resistance and skepticism from Kurt and Spence, all the men eventually agree to go. Before heading to Colombia, they enlist the financial help of a sympathetic local car salesman, Jack, who insists on going along as a condition of funding the rescue, and the military expertise of a mercenary named Norman Shrike. Due to the urgency of the mission, Shrike is only able to give the group perfunctory training in military tactics. Once in Colombia, the group encounters resistance, both from local officials and from the U.S. government. The group eventually lands in jail after being set up by one of Shrike's contacts who was going to supply them with weapons. They are handed over to U.S. officials and put on a plane back to the U.S. Just prior to takeoff, the group manages to escape, but Kurt decides to give up and go home. The group resumes their trek toward Ochobar's camp. Eventually, they are engaged by rebels. Shrike is killed in a firefight while saving one of the men's lives. The group ventures on with the help of a local woman, Veronica, and they eventually find Ochobar's hideout. In the ensuing shootout with Ochobar's men, Jack is killed. The group is able to save Harry and escape, destroying Ochobar's camp in the process. Harry and the men return home to a hero's welcome. Cast * Michael Schoeffling as Corey Burck * Thomas F.

He has also played for Ireland, Free State, Northamptonshire and Transvaal in a well travelled career. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Boksburg, and made his first-class debut in the 1996/97 South African season. Standing relatively tall for a keeper at five feet eleven inches, he has taken 301 first-class catches and completed 22 stumpings. A right hand batsman, he has scored 5,520 runs at 32.09 with eight hundreds and a best of 185. He has played in 123 List A matches, scoring 2,069 runs at 25.54 with a top score of 93* and 60 Twenty20 games, making 776 runs at 19.40 with a best of 57*. Although born in South Africa, he holds a British passport, and so is not considered an overseas player in the English first class game. He represented East Transvaal in that sport in 1991. He struggled with the bat in his first season with Yorkshire in 2006, and faced a fight for a first team place with Simon Guy and Greg Wood. However, he prevailed, although Brophy latterly shared keeping duties for Yorkshire with Jonny Bairstow. In August 2012, Yorkshire released Brophy from the remainder of his playing contract, and signed Andrew Hodd on loan from Sussex, to act as wicketkeeping cover for Bairstow in the County Championship. Brophy, who had been at Yorkshire since 2006, was informed that his contract would not be renewed for 2013, and was free to pursue other opportunities.

At the beginning of the 1950, the company was renamed Ardex Chemie GmbH. The company managed to reduce the drying periods of sub-floor smoothing compounds. This invention enabled the company to manufacture \\"quick-setting\\" screeds, which become fully usable after 24 hours, i.e. installation of the finish top cover is possible after 24 hours. For conventional screeds, the drying period required is about 28 days even today. Using the \\"quick-setting smoothing compounds\\", top floor cover can be laid as soon as after one hour. In the course of the years, the product range was extended and today comprises all relevant ranges of chemistry-based construction products: building products for concrete finishing and repair, bitumen-based products for waterproofing of building structures, quick-setting cements, screeds, sub-floor preparation agents, sub-floor smoothing compounds, epoxy-based industrial floor coverings for floor areas in private and industrial premises, sealing compounds to be applied beneath tiles, adhesives for tiles, natural stones and insulating materials, joint mortar for tiles and marble, sealing compounds for the building trade, wall smoothing compounds for smoothing wall surfaces, floor covering and parquetry adhesives for carpets and parquetry etc. External links * Company website References * \\"TOP100 -- ausgezeichnete Innovatoren im deutschen Mittelstand\\".

It can be reached from the Dunmow South exit of the A120 by following the road towards Braintree (B1256) for 3.2 km before turning right for the village. The centre of the old village, which has just 99 dwellings, is a further 0.6 km along the road. The Flitch Way, a linear country park along the route of the old Braintree to Bishop's Stortford railway, links Little Dunmow and the new settlement of Flitch Green. The new village, built on the site of a former sugar beet factory, is a self-contained community of 850 dwellings and is another kilometre along the road towards Felsted. History=Feudal Barony Little Dunmow formed the caput of a feudal barony the first holder of which was Ralph Baynard, as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Robert FitzWalter I c.1200 at the start of the age of heraldry: Or, a fess gules between two chevrons of the last. This is a heraldic difference of the arms of de Clare, his cousins. He was the builder of Baynard's Castle in the City of London and was followed by his son Geoffrey, whose son William rebelled against King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135) and thereby forfeited his lands. The barony was re-granted by the king to Robert FitzRichard (d.1134/6), younger son of Richard FitzGilbert de Clare (d.1091), feudal baron of Clare, Suffolk. He was succeeded by his son Walter I (d.1198) who was succeeded by his son Robert FitzWalter I (d.1235), founder of the family of FitzWalter, who left as heir a minor, his son Walter FitzWalter (1219‚Äì1258). Walter's son was Robert FitzWalter II (1247‚Äì1326). His son was Robert FitzWalter III (d.1328) who was succeeded by his son John FitzWalter (1315‚Äì1361).Sanders, I.J. English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, \\"Probable Baronies, Little Dunmow\\", pp.129‚Äì130 Foundation of Priory The Parish Church was founded in 1104 by Lady Juga Baynard, wife of Ralph Baynard. After her death her son Geoffrey Baynard founded in 1106 an Augustinian priory dedicated to St Mary. One of its canons served as curate to the parish. The majority of the original structure has been lost but the Lady chapel survives and became the east end of the choir of the large and stately Little Dunmow Priory church, now the Parish Church. It retains the magnificent columns and beautiful Gothic windows as evidence of its former grandeur. The monastic buildings stood to the southwest of the church but, along with much of the Priory, were razed to the ground after the Dissolution of the Monasteries, when the priory site, with the manors of Little Dunmow and Clopton Hall, were granted to the patron of the priory, Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex. Notable buildings Little Dunmow Priory church Many fine 14th, 15th, 16th and 17th-century buildings may still be found in the village, notably Priory Place (on the site of the old Priory), Brick House (beside the footpath to Barnston as it approaches the Chelmer valley), Ivy House (at the junction of The Street and Brook Street, Monks Hall (at the junction of The Street and Grange Lane) and Rose Farm (At the Junction of Grange Lane and the Street). A number of thatched cottages are scattered around the village.'Houses of Austin canons: Priory of Little Dunmow', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 2 (1907), pp. 150‚Äì54. Conservation Area The centre of Little Dunmow has a defined conservation area. In late 2013 Uttlesford District Council held a conservation area appraisal consultation. The .pdf file that accompanied the appraisal is a concise source of information describing buildings of architectural and historic interest and their relationships within the village. Flitch Trials Flitch Chair Little Dunmow was the original home of the Flitch Trials which now take place in Great Dunmow every four years. The ancient Flitch of bacon custom rewarded a couple who had been married in church and remained \\"unregreted\\" for a year and a day, with a flitch of bacon. The claimants had to swear an oath kneeling on two sharp pointed stones in the churchyard. They were then carried through the village to be acclaimed. In later years they were carried in the Flitch Chair, thought to be made from pew ends from the priory church. The original kneeling stones and 15th-century chair can still be seen within the church. The last recorded priory trial was held in 1751 but the custom was revived in Victorian times following the 1854 publication of the novel The Flitch of Bacon by William Harrison Ainsworth. Flitch Green , the Parish of Little Dunmow had an electoral population of 1459 divided between the old village (259) and the newer development of Flitch Green (1200).Uttlesford District Council Register of Electors dated 1 December 2008 Flitch Green became a separate civil parish in April 2009 under an order made by the local authority, Uttlesford District Council, but retains Little Dunmow as its postal address.  \\"Chelmer Mead\\" development proposals  On 13 December 2007, in response to the Uttlesford Core Strategy preferred options consultation, developers Chater Homes announced a proposal to build 3,000 houses in an area provisionally dubbed \\"Chelmer Mead\\", which would have greatly expanded the 90-home settlement of Little Dunmow. Opponents of the Chelmer Mead scheme expressed fears that it could link Little Dunmow with a number of surrounding settlements and erode the individual character of each. This proposal was shelved as according to the company's director, Ian Chater, who said that \\"The feedback we received was that this was too big so we have now reduced it substantially.\\" Chater Homes put forward a substitute proposal for 750 homes to meet the changing requirements in a further Core Strategy consultation, but it had not as of October 2010 gained sufficient local support. The September 2010 statement from Uttlesford District Council notes in para 32 that \\"the District Council can determine how much local growth to accommodate\\" and in para 33 that \\"There is no obvious focus for growth in the district\\". In common with most developers, both Chater Homes proposals were submitted on the last day of the consultation process and hence were unavailable for detailed comment.http://consultation.limehouse.co.uk/representation.do?identifier=uttlesford&action;=list&page;=1&draftId;=23&contentId;=task_644_ID_192 In August 2013, Chater Homes requested a scoping agreement regarding a new 750 home proposed development in the same general area as earlier failed planning applications. The district council responded on 12 September 2013[UTT/13/2157/SO dated 12 August 2013] It is notable that Little Dunmow has never featured as suitable for large developments in the Council's regularly updated Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment. In September 2014, Chater Homes and Home Group submitted an outline planning application for the 750 home development. The application was refused in March 2015.[UTT/14/2756/OP dated 16 September 2014] A further proposal for 400 units in response to a Call for Sites exercise as part of the new Uttlesford Local Plan was again held to be unsuitable on the grounds that it would not contribute to sustainable patterns of development and would have detrimental impacts on historic assets.

Early years McGarrity was born in Carrickmore, County Tyrone, Ireland in 1874. His family grew up in poverty, motivating his need to immigrate later in life. He grew hearing his father discussing Irish politics, including topics such as the Fenians, the Irish Parliamentary Party, and Irish Home Rule. By the time he was an adult, he had developed a keen interest in politics himself. He immigrated to the US in 1892 at the age of 18. He is reputed to have walked to Dublin before boarding a cattle boat to Liverpool disguised as a drover, and then sailing to America using a ticket belonging to someone else. He settled in 4900 Wynfield Ave West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and became successful in the liquor business; however, his business failed on three occasions, twice due to embezzlement by his business partner. Entry into Politics In 1893 he joined Clan na Gael, an Irish organisation based in America committed to aiding the establishment of an independent Irish state. Clan na Gael had been heavily involved with the Fenian Brotherhood that McGarrity had grown up hearing about, and by the latter half of the 19th century had become a sister organisation of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. In the decade just before McGarrity joined, Clan na Gael and the Fenian movement had waged the Fenian dynamite campaign, where they attempted to force the British state to make concessions on Ireland by bombing British Infrastructure. However, this had caused a split within Clan na Gael that was not mended until seven years after McGarrity joined when in 1900 the factions reunited and pleaded to support \\"the complete independence of the Irish people, and the establishment of an Irish republic.\\". In the years that followed the 1880s and 1890s, McGarrity is, amongst others, credited with helping to stitch the organisation back together and bring it renewed strength. McGarrity helped sponsor several Irish Race Conventions and founded and ran a newspaper called The Irish Press from 1918-22 that supported the War of Independence in Ireland. He was the founder of the Philadelphia chapter of Clan Na Gael. During the First World War, while the USA was still neutral, McGarrity was involved in the Hindu‚ÄìGerman Conspiracy; he arranged the Annie Larsen arms purchase and shipment from New York to San Diego for India.Irish Republicans and the Indo-German Conspiracy of World War I. Matthew Erin Plowman. New Hibernia Review 7.3 (2003) 81-105 When √âamon de Valera arrived in the US in 1919 they struck up an immediate rapport and McGarrity managed de Valera's tour of the USA. He persuaded de Valera of the benefits of supporting him and the Philadelphia branch against the New York branch of the Friends of Irish Freedom organisation led by John Devoy and Judge Daniel F. Cohalan. He became president of the American Association for the Recognition of the Irish Republic. He christened his newborn son √âamon de Valera McGarrity, although their relationship became strained upon De Valera's entry back into D√°il √âireann in the Irish Free State. The Anglo-Irish Treaty and after He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and travelled to Dublin in 1922 and assisted the development of the short- lived Collins/De Valera Pact by bringing de Valera and Michael Collins together before the 1922 Irish general election. The Irish Civil War saw a split in Clan na Gael just as it had split Sinn F√©in back in Ireland. McGarrity and a minority of Clan na Gael members supported the anti-treaty side but a majority supported the pro-treaty side, including John Devoy and Daniel Cohalan. Furthermore, in October 1920 Harry Boland informed the Clan na Gael leadership that the IRB would be cutting their ties to the Clan unless the IRB was given more influence over their affairs. Devoy and Cohalan resisted this but McGarrity saw the Clan's connection with the IRB as vital. While McGarrity's faction was initially labelled \\"Reorganised Clan na Gael\\", they were able to inheritance total control of the Clan na Gael name as Devoy was not able to keep effectively organisation of the group. In general, however, the in-fighting amongst the Irish on both sides of the Atlantic was quite disheartening for Irish-Americans and in the years to come neither pro or anti-treaty sides of Clan na Gael saw much in the way of donations. With the scope of Clan na Gael now narrowed, and Devoy and Cohalan removed from the picture, McGarrity became chairman of the organisation. He did not support the founding of Fianna F√°il in 1926 and opposed the party's entry into the D√°il in 1927. Even after the Irish Civil war, McGarrity still supported the idea that a 32 county Irish Republic could be achieved through force. in the spring of 1926, he received IRA Chief of Staff Andy Cooney to America. Cooney and Clan na Gael formally agreed that each organisation would support each other and that Clan na Gael would raise funds, purchase weapons and build support for the IRA in America. Going into the late 1920s though Clan na Gael, as most Irish-American organisation were, was struggling. Having limped past the split caused by the Irish Civil War, the rejection of Fianna F√°il had caused a second split in the membership. Many Irish-Americans saw the IRA and Fianna F√°il as one and the same at that point and Clan na Gael and McGarrity's hostility to them caused much friction. By July 1929, the Clan's membership in one of its strongholds, New York City, was down to just 620 paid members. Then in October that same year Wall Street Crashed and the Great Depression hit. In 1933 McGarrity was left almost bankrupt after he was found guilty of \\"false bookkeeping entries\\". McGarrity's livelihood was saved when he became one of the main ticket agents in the US for the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake. He was a personal friend of Joe McGrath, one of the founders of the Sweepstake. The sweepstakes allowed McGarrity to turn his fortunes back around. Despite the trying times of both Clan na Gael and his personal life, McGarrity held fast in his belief in physical force Irish Republicanism. In 1939 supported the demand from Se√°n Russell for the \\"S-Plan\\" bombing campaign in Britain, which proved disastrous. McGarrity is alleged to have met Hermann G√∂ring in Berlin in 1939 to ask for aid for the IRA, which led indirectly to \\"Plan Kathleen\\". He was a lifelong friend of fellow Carrickmore native and avid Republican, Patrick McCartan. When he died in 1940 a mass was held in the St Mary's Pro- Cathedral in Dublin. McGarrity remained an unrepentant physical force republican all his life. A number of his papers are in the National Library of Ireland. He Donated his personal Library to Villanova University. The IRA signed all its statements 'J.J. McGarrity' up until 1969 when the organisation split into the 'Official' and 'Provisional' movements.The Irish News - March 8, 2005 (Darren McCann) Thereafter the term continued to be used by the Officials while the Provisionals adopted the moniker 'P.O'Neill' Roy Johnston, Century of Endeavour: RJ and Politics in 1970, 2002.

Avoidance of muri in Toyota manufacturing Muri is one of three types of waste (muda, mura, muri) identified in the Toyota Production System. Waste reduction is an effective way to increase profitability. Muri can be avoided through standardized work. To achieve this a standard condition or output must be defined to assure effective judgment of quality. Then every process and function must be reduced to its simplest elements for examination and later recombination. The process must then be standardized to achieve the standard condition. This is done by taking simple work elements and combining them, one-by-one into standardized work sequences. In manufacturing, this includes: * Work flow, or logical directions to be taken, * Repeatable process steps and machine processes, or rational methods to get there, and * Takt time (combined with production/demand leveling to provide for reasonable lengths of time and endurance allowed for a process e.g. if the takt is 10 minutes while there is no realistic way for a process to do its work in less than 10 minutes, Muri is the natural outcome). When everyone knows the standard condition, and the standardized work sequences, the results observed include: * Heightened employee morale (due to close examination of ergonomics and safety) * Higher quality * Improved productivity * Reduced costs  Implementation  In fact the big contribution of Henry Ford and his manufacturing techniques was the reduction of Muri and not so much the production line itself. In order for the production line to function each station on the line had to achieve standard work because the next station was only equipped to work on standard condition components. The Ford production line approximates to an implementation of Takt time which gives enough time to perform the standard work.

In July 1990, \\"Rhythm of Life\\" peaked at No. 92 in the UK Singles Chart. His first album garnered critical acclaim, and Harris' style was compared to Prince, Terence Trent D'arby and female vocalist Tracy Chapman. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Harris was in a low-key relationship with Sin√©ad O'Connor. His song \\"Seven Days\\" was on the soundtrack for Kalifornia, and was subsequently included on his 2002 album Flowers. Illness caused Harris to disappear from the music scene soon after his success, thus stalling what could be regarded as a promising musical career. Harris emerged from a 12-year hiatus, in 2002, to release, Flowers, an album originally recorded in 1992 before an illness forced him to retreat from music.

Early life He was born in Eskerbuoy, near Carrickmore, County Tyrone, one of five children, to Bernard McCartan, a farmer, and the former Bridget Rafferty (d. 1918). He emigrated to the USA as a young man and became a member of Clan na Gael in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and edited the journal Irish Freedom. He returned to Ireland some years later and qualified as a doctor. He also continued working with nationalist politics and worked closely with Bulmer Hobson and Denis McCullough with the Dungannon Clubs and the Irish Republican Brotherhood. McCartan was to take part in the 1916 Easter Rising with the Tyrone volunteers but did not, owing to Eoin MacNeill's countermanding order. He was arrested after the Rising and interned in an open prison in England. Elections In 1917 he took \\"French leave\\" to return to Ireland and assist Sinn F√©in in the by-elections being held throughout Ireland that year. McCartan contested the by-election in South Armagh for Sinn F√©in but lost out to the Irish Parliamentary Party candidate. He was later elected in a by-election in Tullamore in 1918. He was re-elected in the 1918 general election. He was re-elected for Leix‚ÄìOffaly at the 1921 elections. He gave the Anglo-Irish Treaty his support, albeit reluctantly, in the D√°il debates, saying he would not \\"vote for chaos.\\" He blamed the whole cabinet for the situation and said that \\"The Republic of which Mr. de Valera was President is dead.\\" Disillusioned, he quit politics for the next twenty years. Diplomatic missions 1919‚Äì1921 At the meeting of the First D√°il in January 1919 McCartan was appointed Sinn F√©in's representative in the USA where he would remain until 1921. One of his tasks was to secure American recognition before the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but this proved impossible. While in the USA he renewed his acquaintance with his fellow Carrickmore native Joseph McGarrity. They persuaded √âamon de Valera to support the Philadelphia branch of Clan na Gael against the New York branch led by John Devoy and Judge Daniel Cohalan in their struggle to focus the resources of the Friends of Irish Freedom on Irish independence rather than domestic American politics. McCartan also assisted with the development of the \\"American Association for the Recognition of the Irish Republic\\". McCartan then negotiated with the Soviet Union in 1920‚Äì21 in an attempt to have it recognise the Irish Republic, at a time when both were pariah states.Proposals about Russia, May 1920 Although Soviet Russia was atheist, he hoped that Ireland could act as \\"accredited representative of the Republic of Ireland in Russia the interests of the Roman Catholic Church within the territory of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic.\\"Para 5, Draft Treaty with Russia, May 1920 Later political career He contested the 1945 presidential election as an independent candidate and secured 20% of the vote.

She is mother to Rukirabasaija Oyo Nyimba Kabamba Iguru Rukidi IV, the reigning Omukama of Toro. Early life She is the daughter of Prince Mujunju, of the Batuku clan, of Rwebisengo, Bundibugyo District. She was educated at Kahinju Primary School, Mpanga Senior Secondary School and Kyebambe Girls School, all in the Kingdom of Toro. She is the Founder and Patron of the Toro Women's Development Association and a co- founder of the African Queens and Women Cultural Leaders Network. Queen Best Kemigisa is a passionate about issues that affect girls and women in Africa. She organises Hakyooto events in various parts of Africa to education, entertain and empower people so that they are able to live their best lives. Queen Mother Queen Best was widowed on 3 August 1995 when King Patrick Olimi Kaboyo II died suddenly. She was one of the guardians of her son, the new King and one of a team of regents who helped rule Toro until he reached his majority in 2010. Her daughter, Princess Ruth Nsemere Komuntale, was married to African-American businessman Christopher Thomas, but they have since divorced. Controversies Queen Best took part in the controversial Kings and Sultans of Africa Forum set up by the then Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi. She allegedly evicted 60-year-old John Businge from disputed land with the support of armed members of the King's security force. Queen Best brought charges of fraud against a man accused of stealing around $60,000 US from her, money supposed to be used to register her Toro Women's Organisation with the United Nations. Moses Kyeyune was convicted in May 2013 and sentenced to five years in prison. She was also involved in a legal fight with a lawyer, Bob Kasango whom she claimed had defrauded her of a large sum of money.

The term refers to the black bag of equipment that a burglar would carry or a black bag operation. As with rubber-hose cryptanalysis, this is technically not a form of cryptanalysis; the term is used sardonically. However, given the free availability of very high strength cryptographic systems, this type of attack is a much more serious threat to most users than mathematical attacks because it is often much easier to attempt to circumvent cryptographic systems (e.g. steal the password) than to attack them directly. Regardless of the technique used, such methods are intended to capture highly sensitive information e.g. cryptographic keys, key-rings, passwords or unencrypted plaintext. The required information is usually copied without removing or destroying it, so capture often takes place without the victim realizing it has occurred. Methods In addition to burglary, the covert means might include the installation of keystroke logging or trojan horse software or hardware installed on (or near to) target computers or ancillary devices. It is even possible to monitor the electromagnetic emissions of computer displays or keyboards from a distance of 20 metres (or more), and thereby decode what has been typed. This could be done by surveillance technicians, or via some form of bug concealed somewhere in the room. Although sophisticated technology is often used, black bag cryptanalysis can also be as simple as the process of copying a password which someone has unwisely written down on a piece of paper and left inside their desk drawer. The case of United States v. Scarfo highlighted one instance in which FBI agents using a sneak and peek warrant placed a keystroke logger on an alleged criminal gang leader.

History The southern Blackriver Mohe were subjects of King Seon of the Balhae. Balhae was conquered by the Khitan Liao Empire in 926\\\\. The Blackriver Mohe are sometimes linked with the Jurchen who established China's Jin Dynasty in the 10th century and who later formed the core of the Manchu who established the Qing Dynasty in the 17th century. At the time of their notice by Chinese historians, the Jurchen inhabited the forests and river valleys of the land which is now divided between China's Heilongjiang Province and Russia's Maritime Province, outside the range of the Blackriver Mohe, and such links remain conjectural. Culture The Mohe enjoyed eating pork, practiced pig farming extensively, and were mainly sedentary,Gorelova 2002, pp. 13-4. and also used both pig and dog skins for coats. They were predominantly farmers and grew soybean, wheat, millet, and rice, in addition to engaging in hunting.Gorelova 2002, p. 14. Archaeological exploration Modern archaeologists on both sides of the Amur/Heilongjiang River have made a number of conclusions about the correspondence of the discovered archaeological cultures to the ethnic groups known from ancient records. According to Russian archaeologists, prior to about the second half of the 7th century AD the Lesser Khingan mountain range formed a natural boundary between two groups of archaeological cultures. West of the range, the Talakan Culture (—Ç–∞–ª–∞–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞) was succeeded by the Mikhailovskaya Culture (–º–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞), which has been identified with the Mongolic-speaking Shiwei people. East of the range, the Poltsevo Culture (–ø–æ–ª—å—Ü–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞) and the Naifeld Group (–Ω–∞–π—Ñ–µ–ª—å–¥—Å–∫–∞—è –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã, also known as Tongzhen Culture based on the findings on the Chinese side of the River) of the Mohe Culture was found; the latter was identified with the Tungusic Heishui Mohe people.–°.–ü. –ù–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤ (S.P.

Modern researchers surmise that the migration of some of the Mohe people west of the range during the late 7th - early 8th century may have been caused by the pressure from the Balhae further south. Another Mohe group, the Sumo Mohe from the Sungari Valley migrated to the Western Amur Valley at roughly the same time as well. Which Mohe group arrived to the region first remains the subject of a dispute, hinging on radiocarbon and stratigraphic dating of various sites. There is some archaeological evidence for the migration of the Sumo Mohe to the northeast, to the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk as well, namely, apparent influence of the Neifeld Culture found in the ceramics of the Tokarevo Culture of the latter region.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 9, 1982. The district encompasses a portion of the Upper West Side- Central Park West Historic District as designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and contains a number of prominent New York City landmarks, including The Dakota Apartments, a National Historic Landmark. The buildings date from the late 19th century to the early 1940s and exhibit a variety of architectural styles. The majority of the district's buildings are of neo-Italian Renaissance style, but Art Deco is a popular theme as well. History The buildings that are part of the historic district were mostly developed in the 1880s through 1930s, following the construction of Central Park. This was further spurred by the construction of the Ninth Avenue Elevated, which provided easy access to Lower Manhattan. Tenements and row houses lined Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues (formerly Tenth and Ninth Avenues, respectively), while more upscale luxury buildings were built on Central Park West (formerly Eighth Avenue). Generally, the further away a lot was from Columbus Avenue and its elevated railway, the more upscale the house was likely to become. By the early 20th century, the row houses were destroyed to make way for apartment buildings. The construction of the New York City Subway's Eighth Avenue Line in the 1920s accelerated this process of redevelopment. The Central Park West Historic District was federally recognized on November 9, 1982, when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It had been designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) in 1973. The LPC designation covered a T-shaped area, which included one block of West 76th Street, two adjacent blocks of Central Park West and a short stretch of West 77th Street, as the Central Park West‚Äì76th Street Historic District. The local designation and boundaries persisted well past the 1982 National Register listing. In 1990 the LPC formally extended the local boundaries of the Central Park West‚Äì76th Street Historic District to include almost all of the area included in the boundaries of the federal historic district. The much larger Upper West Side-Central Park West Historic District includes the area from 96th Street to 62nd Street and Central Park West to Amsterdam Avenue. Boundaries The Central Park West Historic District is a linear historic district including the stretch of Central Park West from 61st to 97th Streets. When the Upper West Side‚ÄìCentral Park West Historic District was designated in 1990 as a local historic district its boundaries closely mirrored those of the 1982 Central Park West Historic District, except the local historic district encompasses land stretching to Amsterdam Avenue. The federal historic district is considerably smaller than the local district.Map of Upper West Side-Central Park Historic District , New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. Retrieved April 3, 2007. Architecture The expanse of Central Park West between 61st and 97th Streets is a mixture of late 19th- and early 20th-century architectural styles. By far the district's most dominant style is Neo-Renaissance, mostly neo-Italian Renaissance though there are German and Flemish Renaissance influences found in some of the structures. Art Deco, Second Empire, Beaux- Arts and Neoclassical architecture are all found in multiple buildings. Gothic and Romanesque Revival influences can be found combined with other styles in some of the buildings as well as on their own. A few Queen Anne, Art Moderne and Italianate buildings dot the streetscape of Central Park West. Structures Of the buildings within the boundaries of the historic district only one was considered a non-contributing property to the historic character of the district when it was nominated to the National Register: the building located at 80 Central Park West, a 1965 modern building. The area within the district is home to nearly 40 high-quality, luxury apartment highrises. Sprinkled within the residential buildings are four Christian churches, one synagogue, several smaller-scale, multi-family houses, the New York Society for Ethical Culture, the New York Historical Society and the American Museum of Natural History.The list contains information on each structure including, its common name. If the building doesn't have a general common name that can be attributed to a reliable source then the address is substituted. The address is listed for each structure because it provides a general reference point to navigate the structures of the historic district. The list's default sort orders the properties as they are on the street, from low numbered blocks (e.g. 15 Central Park West) to high numbered blocks (e.g. 336 Central Park West). Properties with addresses on streets other than Central Park West also follow this order and are in place on the list as they would appear if the historic district were walked through. Linked information on each building's major architectural themes is also listed. Following the date of construction the architect or architects names are listed. Any pertinent remarks are listed in the last column.  Contributing properties  These properties are contributing properties to the Central Park West Historic District.

The district is located along one of the city's finest residential streets and consists mostly of apartment buildings which are among some of the earliest in New York. With the 1990 local boundary increase the NYLPC developed the theme that the strength of the historic district lay in its diversity. The Commission called the buildings in the district brashly \\"commercial\\" and \\"stylistically diverse.\\" The Commission went on to stress the importance of the district's special skyline that challenged the whole of the New York skyline. \\"The stylistically diverse buildings of Central Park West create a streetscape and a skyline which is exuberant and varied as to scale, height and form\\", the Commission stated.Answers to Questions About the Project ‚Äì Addendum , New York Historical Society.

History left The parish of St Matthias Stoke Newington was created in 1849, out of the parish of Stoke Newington and a parcel of 'detached' land belonging to Hornsey parish. The patron of the new parish - responsible for appointing the clergy - was alternately the Crown and the Bishop of London. The impressive church building was designed by William Butterfield (1814‚Äì1900) and completed and consecrated in June 1853. The cost of the building was substantially met by a wealthy local surgeon named Robert Brett (1808‚Äì74). Brett was concerned at the flourishing of local Dissenting chapels such as the Newington Green Unitarian Church at the expense of the Established Church whose local buildings simply could not accommodate the area's rapidly growing population.Alex Allardyce The Village that Changed the World: a history of Newington Green London N16. (London: Newington Green Action Group, 2008) p33. The building suffered from aerial bombing during the Second World War when all the interior surface decoration, stained glass and furniture was destroyed, as too the brick and stone vaulting of the chancel.

The structures use the walls or fences which separate properties from the pavement and street outside. Materials include cloth, corrugated iron, cardboard, wood, plastic, and sometimes also bricks or cement. Mumbai According to Sheela Patel of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC), pavement dwellers are primarily first generation migrants who moved to Mumbai as early as the 1940s, and who have lived on the pavement of public roadways ever since. They are completely invisible as far as local, state, and national policies are concerned. People who sleep on or near pavements often pay to keep their belongings in shops, kiosks, or other buildings. SPARC conducted a study in 1985 called We the Invisible based on a census of about 6,000 households. It showed approximately half of the pavement dwellers to be from the poorest districts in the state of Maharashtra, with the other half from the poorest parts of wider India. Many came as victims of drought, famine, earthquakes, religious persecution or riots. Others came as a result of a complete breakdown in their livelihoods where they had been living. Pavement dwellers migrate to Mumbai hoping to capitalize on the wealth and job opportunities that the city offers. They are typically forward-thinking, seeking to build lives in the city that give the next generation better opportunities than would have been possible in the village.Development Gateway Foundation: Urban Development: Empowering Slum Dwellers: Interview with Sheela Patel , 7 September 2004 1985 eviction crisis In 1985, the Supreme Court of India granted the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai authority to demolish household structures on the sidewalks of Mumbai.

The society's journal History Today has been appearing annually since 2000. The society is now known as The History and Culture Society, and is chaired by Prof. D.P Tiwari, a professor in the Department of Ancient Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Lucknow. The Society aims to promote and organise interdisciplinary studies of Indian history and culture and to provide a common platform for distinguished scholars engaged in Indology, as well as organise various academic journals and conferences.  Formation  The Society was founded by Dr. S.P. Gupta (a prominent archaeologist and Chairman of the Indian Archaeological Society) and Dr. D. Devahuti of the National Museum, New Delhi, and inaugurated by then Prime Minister Morarji Desai accompanied by eminent scholars such as Prof. Lallanji Gopal (of BHU), Prof. B. P. Sinha (head of History at Patna University), Prof. Khalid Ahmed Nizami (head of History at Aligarh Muslim University), Prof. G.C. Pande, Prof. K.D. Bajpai, and Prof. Tan Chung. The publication History Today was first edited by Dr. S.K Jolly (a historian of Sikh Revivalism) and subsequently, in due course it was edited by Dr. Vandana Kaushik, Ms. S. Radhakrishnan and Prof. D.P. Tiwari. When the Janata government of 1977-79 (including the former Jan Sangh) was elected, it blocked the Towards Freedom Project of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) claiming that the history textbooks promoted by the ICHR suffered an ahistorical Marxist ideological distortion. After the Indian History Congress endorsed the textbook writers affiliated with the ICHR, the Janata government funded the then new Indian History and Culture Society. According to scholars L.I. Rudolph and Sussane Rudolph, it attracted a variety of historians, some sympathetic to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and others disaffected from the textbook \\"establishment.\\"  Activities  The IHCS offered a forum for a dialogue among quarrelling Indian historians and organised a number of seminars to discuss fundamental problems of Indian historiography. According to its chairperson Prof. D. Devahuti, \\"one had to free oneself from Western categories like, for instance, that of class struggle, and resume 'indigenous frameworks of interpretation'.\\" She characterised Indian history, including medieval Indian history, as one of consent: 'emphasis appears to have been on consensus, i.e. adjustment, give and take, synthesis or at least an active acceptance of coexistence'. The group's first publication, the 1979 Problems of Indian Historiography, is essentially the proceedings of its seminar in 1978. The book sought to free itself from 'imperialist and Marxist' approaches while simultaneously avoiding Hindu or Muslim communal biases in order to foster writing a more 'objective history' from a postcolonial, nativist, and an Indian point of view rather than a foreign one. Historian Pratap Chandra criticised British historians of India and their Indian disciples for their idea that nation states were deemed to be 'intrinsically desirable', which he argued led to an overstatement of the historical unity of India. Historian D.P Singhal further vehemently criticised Marxists, finding them a growing and unhealthy influence on Indian universities and their history departments.

Born and raised in South Africa, Kieswetter moved to England to complete his education, and began playing county cricket for Somerset in 2007. Three years later, he made his international debut in a One Day International (ODI) against Bangladesh. A wicket-keeper batsman, he was considered a one-day specialist, and all his international appearances came in ODIs or Twenty20 Internationals. Kieswetter played junior cricket for Western Province until the age of 18, but lack of opportunity led him to seek an alternative route in England. He studied at Millfield, where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of South Africa, Graeme Smith, invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England. In early 2010, Kieswetter achieved his target; some strong performances for the England Lions, especially in a match against the senior England team, won him a place in the squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international century in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the man of the match in the final when England won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by Jos Buttler, his teammate at Somerset. Kieswetter's career was cut short by an injury sustained while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision and he announced his retirement from professional cricket in June 2015, aged 27. In 2017, he became a professional golfer. Early life and career Kieswetter was born in Johannesburg to an Afrikaner father, Wayne, and Scottish mother, Belinda. He studied at Diocesan College in Cape Town, and played cricket for Western Province junior teams between the ages of 13 and 18. Kieswetter was disappointed when he was asked to play club cricket for two or three seasons before returning to play for the senior team; he never received an explanation and decided instead to pursue a cricket career in England, where he moved at the age of 18. He studied for his A-levels for a year at Millfield, where Mark Davis, a former Somerset bowler, spotted him. He was quickly signed by Somerset. At the 2006 Under-19s World Cup in Sri Lanka, he represented South Africa and won a Man of the Match award in a game against the United States for his innings of 80 off 66 balls. Kieswetter made his first appearance for Somerset's second team in May 2006, taking over from Sam Spurway as wicket-keeper midway through a match when the latter was injured. He scored 94 not out in his first innings of that match against Glamorgan, and by the end of the season he had scored at an average of over 40. His performances were so strong that Somerset chose to release Spurway at the start of the 2007 season, and named Kieswetter alongside Carl Gazzard as their two wicket-keepers. In early April that year, he made his one-day debut for Somerset against Glamorgan; he made 69 not out off 58 balls and took a catch described as \\"world class\\" by Somerset's director of cricket, Brian Rose. He made his first-class debut the following month, keeping wicket while Derbyshire made 801 for8 declared and scored 63 in the Somerset reply. Kieswetter continued to perform well during 2007 and 2008, and was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award, as the \\"most promising young player\\", for Somerset in both seasons, scoring several fifties in first-class and one-day cricket. Against Glamorgan, he scored 93 while batting at number eight. Kieswetter came in after two wickets had been lost in an over, with the score at 250 for 6. His innings, which included a partnership of 130 with Andrew Caddick, helped Somerset to reach 402 and eventually win the match. Towards the end of the 2008 season, during a 40-over match against Gloucestershire, Kieswetter scored his first century for Somerset, scoring from , and sharing a competition- record 302-run partnership with Marcus Trescothick. In 2009, Kieswetter passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time during his career. Early in the year, he scored an unbeaten 150 in a high-scoring draw against Warwickshire, his maiden first-class century. A few weeks later, he scored against Durham to help his county avoid defeat. In his report for ESPNcricinfo, Andrew McGlashan described Kieswetter as \\"another likely South African to make the transition to England colours\\". Kieswetter scored two further first-class centuries during the year, both at Taunton, against Sussex and Lancashire; he averaged just under 60 for his 1,242 first-class runs in the season. In one-day cricket, Kieswetter opened the batting alongside Trescothick, and averaged 65.83, scoring an unbeaten 138 off 131 balls against Warwickshire. In the quarter-final of the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, Kieswetter scored his second one-day century of the season, but Somerset were defeated by six wickets. His in the 2009 Twenty20 Cup helped Somerset reach the final of that competition, where they were again beaten by Sussex. He was awarded his county cap during the final game of the 2009 County Championship against Worcestershire. International cricketer=International selection Following his strong performances for Somerset, Kieswetter was part of the England Performance Programme squad that spent eight weeks of the English winter training in Loughborough and Pretoria. The South African national cricket captain, Graeme Smith, said he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the South Africa national cricket team, he stated that \\"the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly someone we have seen and would like to get back into the system\\". Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England. In 2010, Kieswetter qualified to play for England on the basis of having a British passport, via his Scottish mother, and his residency in England. Under the rules for international cricket, he had to wait until four years after his last appearance for South Africa, which was on 16 February 2006 during the Under-19s World Cup. In January 2010, he was named as part of the England Lions squad to tour the United Arab Emirates for a series against Pakistan A. The England head coach, Andy Flower, described Kieswetter's performances during that tour as \\"a really good start\\", and described the Twenty20 warm-up match between the England Lions and the England senior team that followed the tour as \\"a chance for him to impress\\". During that match, which was played on the day that he qualified for England, Kieswetter scored to help the Lions beat the senior team. alt=as caption After England's drawn T20I series with Pakistan in mid-February 2010, Kieswetter was added to the senior England squad for the ODI series against Bangladesh. He was immediately included in the team, playing as a specialist batsman alongside wicket-keeper Matt Prior, in the first warm-up match on 23 February against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI. He scored 143, his career-best one-day score, from 123 balls. That score, and his performances for the England Lions, led to Kieswetter's selection for the first ODI against Bangladesh on 28 February. Opening the innings alongside captain Alastair Cook, Kieswetter struggled in his first over; he made in an innings described by ESPNcricinfos Andrew Miller as \\"tinged with nerves\\" and \\"chancy\\". In the next match, two days later, Kieswetter misplayed his first ball and was nearly dismissed; he was then caught off a similar mishit from the next ball bowled. In the third match, he scored his first international century‚Äì which helped England to 284 for five and a 45-run victory. England won the series 3‚Äì0. In contrast to the \\"hard-hitting batting\\" which Geoff Miller, the England selector, had cited as one of the reasons for his inclusion, Kieswetter's century was patiently built after a nervous start. When the England squad was announced for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, Kieswetter was named as the only wicket-keeper in the squad, replacing Prior. Kieswetter opened the innings with Michael Lumb throughout the tournament, and ESPNcricinfos Andrew McGlashan identified their performances as one of the reasons that England reached the final. During the final, Kieswetter was England's top-scorer, hitting from , and was named as the man of the match as England won their first ICC global title. During the tournament, Kieswetter scored , the fourth-most of any player, at an average of 31.71 and a strike rate of 116.84. Dropped and recalled by England After returning to England, Kieswetter's form dipped, and he scored 121runs from eight ODIs against Australia and Bangladesh. As a result, when England played five ODIs against Pakistan in September, Kieswetter was omitted and Worcestershire's Steven Davies was preferred, although Kieswetter was included in the T20I squad. Kieswetter opened the innings alongside Davies, who was playing as wicket-keeper, in the two T20Is, but made scores of only six and sixteen. Although named in the T20I squad for the tour of Australia, he was not selected to play, and instead took part in the England Performance Programme XI tour, before joining up with the England Lions to take part in the Regional Four Day Competition in the West Indies. During the competition, Kieswetter scored two centuries, against the Leeward Islands and the Combined Campuses and Colleges. alt=as caption Kieswetter began the 2011 season strongly for Somerset, scoring in his first four one-day matches, including two centuries. Another century, in the County Championship prompted Jeremy James of ESPNcricinfo to ask \\"whether Craig Kieswetter will regain his place in England's one-day side before Jos Buttler assumes it ahead of him\\". His form earned him a recall to England's one-day squads for the series against Sri Lanka, Geoff Miller saying \\"[Kieswetter] will offer some real fire power with the bat along with his ability with the gloves\\". In his first match back for England, the Twenty20 match, Kieswetter scored only four runs, but he was England's top-scorer in the first ODI match, with . He struck another half- century in the fourth match of the series: he scored 72 not out as England won by ten wickets. A week later, playing for Somerset against Nottinghamshire, he scored , the highest innings of his first-class career, as part of a 290-run partnership with James Hildreth. Kieswetter remained England wicket-keeper for the T20I and ODI matches against India late in the season. In the T20I, Buttler, his fellow Somerset wicket-keeper, made his debut, albeit as a specialist batsman; Jonny Bairstow, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, made his debut in the final ODI in a similar role. In that series, Kieswetter struggled against the moving ball in English conditions but was praised for his attacking batting, including from in the second match. Based on the number of appearances that he made for England, Kieswetter was awarded an incremental contract by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in September 2011. During England's subsequent 5‚Äì0 ODI series loss in India, described by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanacks Stephen Brenkley as \\"a tour too far for England\\", Kieswetter was the only England batsman to maintain a strike rate above 100. He scored one half-century during the tour, and was included in the England Lions squad that toured Sri Lanka three months later. End of international career Playing for the Lions, Kieswetter moved into the middle-order, rather than opening the batting; this was intended to prepare him for a similar switch with the senior England team to allow Kevin Pietersen to open. He scored a century and a half-century to help England win the series 3‚Äì2, though he was outperformed by Buttler. In early 2012, playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, Kieswetter batted only twice in the ODI series, and was praised for his 43-run contribution in the fourth match, though George Dobell of ESPNcricinfo identified his wicket-keeping as \\"still not as polished as he would like\\". Although Kieswetter dropped down the order in ODIs, he retained his place opening the batting in T20Is. In contrast to the 2010 World Twenty20, when the England players were told to attack bat selflessly, in 2012 the team was instructed to avoid losing early wickets, and Kieswetter struggled to adapt his game to score low-risk singles and rotate the strike. During the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, he lost his place in England's T20I team after a match against New Zealand in which he scored four runs from fourteen balls. That was his final international Twenty20 match. In his 25 games, he scored at an average of 21.91 and a strike rate of 111.91. Despite his struggles in international cricket, Kieswetter had a successful season with Somerset in 2012; he scored 848 first-class runs at an average of just over 60, including a century against Warwickshire and one for the Lions against Australia A. The following year, he retained his place in the ODI team for the tour of India, although ESPNcricinfos Alex Winter suggested that it might be due to \\"England's desire to protect the workload of their players ahead of back-to-back Ashes series.\\" Winter's colleague, Dobell, described the England ODI wicket-keeper position as one of England's key areas requiring resolution, citing both Bairstow and Buttler as candidates to take over, as well as the possibility of Matt Prior, the England Test wicket-keeper, reclaiming the role. Kieswetter played the first three ODIs of the series, scoring 24 not out, 18 and 0 before he was dropped and replaced by Buttler. Dobell described Kieswetter as \\"perhaps... a little unfortunate\\", but cited his inability to adjust his game and the number of balls he blocked as the reasons for his removal. He played , scoring at an average of 30.11. Later domestic career The competition between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket- keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the role for the county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which kept him out of action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the 2013 Friends Life t20 with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, Peter Trego, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he \\"tried to be a bit more of a responsible player, rather than just power blazing.\\" He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against relegation, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset. Kieswetter signed with the Brisbane Heat for the 2013‚Äì14 Big Bash League. During the tournament, he scored from eight matches including two half-centuries. He entered the 2014 Indian Premier League auction, but remained unsold. He was called up as a late replacement for the injured Luke Wright for England's squad in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20, but was not selected to play. He began the 2014 season positively for Somerset, particularly in the Twenty20 competition, in which he scored six half- centuries in ten innings, averaging just under 50. Injury and retirement from cricket On 12 July 2014, Kieswetter suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone while batting for Somerset against Northamptonshire in a County Championship match. The bowler, David Willey, delivered a bouncer which went through the gap between the grille and the visor on Kieswetter's helmet and struck him in the face. The injuries were initially described by Somerset's chairman, Andy Nash, as \\"serious but non-career threatening\\". He underwent facial surgery, and suffered from double vision for a while after. He returned to the Somerset side before the end of the 2014 season and scored a half-century in his first match back, against Middlesex, though he admitted that his vision was still not fully recovered. Kieswetter signed for the South African franchise Warriors as their overseas player to play in the Ram Slam T20 Challenge for the 2014‚Äì15 season. He played all ten matches for the Warriors, scoring at an average of 22.11, including two half-centuries. On 10 December 2014, despite having been named in England's 30-man provisional 2015 Cricket World Cup squad, Kieswetter revealed that he was still suffering vision problems. He announced that he would not play in the 2015 season and would seek further treatment. The following June, he announced his retirement from professional cricket, saying that, although he was still capable of playing, he could not play to the standard he wanted: \\"In the end I just thought, there are too many mediocre players in county cricket‚Äì and good luck to them‚Äì but I don't want to be another one.\\" He found batting in floodlit conditions particularly difficult, and described the vision in his right eye as being \\"only at 80 or 85 percent\\". He finished his career with similar statistics in first-class and one-day cricket; in both he averaged just under 40 and had scored eleven centuries. In Twenty20 cricket, his highest score was 89 not out, and he averaged just over 30. In an interview with ESPNcricinfo shortly after his retirement, Kieswetter said that he would be interested in working in the media, perhaps as part of a commentary team for Twenty20 matches. Although rare, the injury to Kieswetter was followed by another high- profile case, when Phillip Hughes died after being struck on the head by a cricket ball while batting. These incidents led the ECB to make the wearing of helmets mandatory for professional cricketers in England from the start of the 2016 season, and banned them from wearing helmets with adjustable grilles, specifying that the gap between the grille and the cap should be no more than . Playing style Kieswetter's confident and attacking batting style was compared to that of Kevin Pietersen, another England batsman of South African origin. Although Kieswetter favoured the off-side, he was also strong behind square on both sides, and stood with a typical South African stance, his bat held high. He played with what Wisden described as an \\"attractive, uncomplicated front-foot technique\\". He began his career playing in front of his stumps, but once bowlers had worked out his technique, he moved his batting stance to outside the leg stump to give himself more space to drive the ball. This move had some success on flat subcontinental pitches, but was less effective in England, where the ball tended to change direction more. Kieswetter admitted that the change had not worked, saying that \\"I wasn‚Äôt really moving my feet. I was staying leg-side and playing with my hands. My technique just wasn‚Äôt strong enough to cope.\\" After being dropped by England, Kieswetter worked on his batting, which had been described by Steve James as a \\"frenzy at the crease, as manic as a teenager on a night out\\". He moved back in front of his stumps, and maintained a calmer mentality, aiming to construct an innings. He was generally more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism for the quality of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets. Somerset experimented with Kieswetter throughout the order, trying to find the most effective place for him. He began as a middle-order batsman, but by the end of the 2007 season, although he remained in the middle-order in first-class cricket, Kieswetter regularly found himself opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in one-day cricket, a role he would also take up in opening six matches of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, although he later dropped back into the middle order to improve the balance of the side. On his international call-up, England chose to use Kieswetter as an opening batsman. He was selected \\"because of his proven ability to pierce the field in the Powerplay overs, particularly with his booming drives up and over the covers.\\" He later moved down the order for England to accommodate Kevin Pietersen as opener. Golf career After Kieswetter's retirement from cricket, his father suggested that he take a break and play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.

This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2019 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for Bulgaria. It includes 428 bird species. The varied natural habitat, relief and climate and relatively untouched environment are among the main reasons for the many bird species in the country. The numerous islands and wetlands along the Danube including the Persina Natural Park and Srebarna Nature Reserve, as well as the lakes and swamps along the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, support many species of diving and aquatic birds such as ducks, swans, pelicans, grebes, spoonbills and many others. The eastern Rhodopes are among the strongholds of birds of prey in Europe, with most of the species in the continent nesting in that area. The mild climate in the extreme south offers good conditions for many Mediterranean birds as well as for wintering species from the north. The following tags highlight several categories of occurrence other than regular migrants and residents. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in Bulgaria (also called a vagrant) * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to Bulgaria as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions * (Ex) Extirpated - a species no longer found in Bulgaria but found elsewhere Ducks, geese, and waterfowl Order: AnseriformesFamily: Anatidae Anatidae includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl, such as geese and swans.

Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down. *Greater flamingo, Phoenicopterus roseus (A) Grebes Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Horned grebe, Podiceps auritus (A) *Red-necked grebe, Podiceps grisegena *Great crested grebe, Podiceps cristatus *Eared grebe, Podiceps nigricollis Pigeons and doves Order: ColumbiformesFamily: Columbidae Pigeons and doves are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy cere. *Rock pigeon, Columba livia *Stock dove, Columba oenas *Common wood-pigeon, Columba palumbus *European turtle-dove, Streptopelia turtur *Eurasian collared-dove, Streptopelia decaocto *Laughing dove, Streptopelia senegalensis (A) Sandgrouse Order: PterocliformesFamily: Pteroclidae Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes. *Pallas's sandgrouse, Syrrhaptes paradoxus (A) Bustards Order: OtidiformesFamily: Otididae Bustards are large terrestrial birds mainly associated with dry open country and steppes in the Old World. They are omnivorous and nest on the ground. They walk steadily on strong legs and big toes, pecking for food as they go. They have long broad wings with \\"fingered\\" wingtips and striking patterns in flight. Many have interesting mating displays. *Great bustard, Otis tarda (A) *Little bustard, Tetrax tetrax (A) Cuckoos Order: CuculiformesFamily: Cuculidae The family Cuculidae includes cuckoos, roadrunners and anis. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are brood parasites. *Great spotted cuckoo, Clamator glandarius (A) *Common cuckoo, Cuculus canorus Nightjars and allies Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Caprimulgidae Nightjars are medium-sized nocturnal birds that usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills. Most have small feet, of little use for walking, and long pointed wings. Their soft plumage is camouflaged to resemble bark or leaves. *Eurasian nightjar, Caprimulgus europaeus Swifts Order: CaprimulgiformesFamily: Apodidae Swifts are small birds which spend the majority of their lives flying. These birds have very short legs and never settle voluntarily on the ground, perching instead only on vertical surfaces. Many swifts have long swept-back wings which resemble a crescent or boomerang. *Alpine swift, Apus melba *Common swift, Apus apus *Pallid swift, Apus pallidus *Little swift, Apus affinis (A) Rails, gallinules, and coots Order: GruiformesFamily: Rallidae Rallidae is a large family of small to medium-sized birds which includes the rails, crakes, coots, and gallinules. Typically they inhabit dense vegetation in damp environments near lakes, swamps, or rivers. In general they are shy and secretive birds, making them difficult to observe. Most species have strong legs and long toes which are well adapted to soft uneven surfaces. They tend to have short, rounded wings and to be weak fliers. *Water rail, Rallus aquaticus *Corn crake, Crex crex *Spotted crake, Porzana porzana *Eurasian moorhen, Gallinula chloropus *Eurasian coot, Fulica atra *Little crake, Zapornia parva *Baillon's crake, Zapornia pusilla (A) Cranes Order: GruiformesFamily: Gruidae Cranes are large, long-legged, and long-necked birds. Unlike the similar-looking but unrelated herons, cranes fly with necks outstretched, not pulled back. Most have elaborate and noisy courting displays or \\"dances\\". *Demoiselle crane, Anthropoides virgo (A) *Common crane, Grus grus Thick-knees Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Burhinidae The thick-knees are a group waders found worldwide within the tropical zone, with some species also breeding in temperate Europe and Australia. They are medium to large waders with strong black or yellow-black bills, large yellow eyes, and cryptic plumage. Despite being classed as waders, most species have a preference for arid or semi-arid habitats. *Eurasian thick-knee, Burhinus oedicnemus Stilts and avocets Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Recurvirostridae Recurvirostridae is a family of large wading birds, which includes the avocets and stilts.

The majority of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Variation in length of legs and bills enables multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food. *Whimbrel, Numenius phaeopus *Slender-billed curlew, Numenius tenuirostris (A) *Eurasian curlew, Numenius arquata *Bar-tailed godwit, Limosa lapponica (A) *Black-tailed godwit, Limosa limosa *Ruddy turnstone, Arenaria interpres *Red knot, Calidris canutus (A) *Ruff, Calidris pugnax *Broad-billed sandpiper, Calidris falcinellus *Sharp-tailed sandpiper, Calidris acuminata (A) *Curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea *Temminck's stint, Calidris temminckii *Sanderling, Calidris alba *Dunlin, Calidris alpina *Purple sandpiper, Calidris maritima (A) *Little stint, Calidris minuta *Buff-breasted sandpiper, Calidris subruficollis (A) *Pectoral sandpiper, Calidris melanotos (A) *Jack snipe, Lymnocryptes minimus (A) *Eurasian woodcock, Scolopax rusticola *Great snipe, Gallinago media (A) *Common snipe, Gallinago gallinago *Terek sandpiper, Xenus cinereus (A) *Wilson's phalarope, Phalaropus tricolor (A) *Red-necked phalarope, Phalaropus lobatus *Red phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarius (A) *Common sandpiper, Actitis hypoleucos *Spotted sandpiper, Actitis macularius (A) *Green sandpiper, Tringa ochropus *Spotted redshank, Tringa erythropus *Common greenshank, Tringa nebularia *Marsh sandpiper, Tringa stagnatilis *Wood sandpiper, Tringa glareola *Common redshank, Tringa totanus Pratincoles and coursers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Glareolidae Glareolidae is a family of wading birds comprising the pratincoles, which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the coursers, which have long legs, short wings, and long, pointed bills which curve downwards. *Collared pratincole, Glareola pratincola *Black-winged pratincole, Glareola nordmanni (A) Skuas and jaegers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Stercorariidae The family Stercorariidae are, in general, medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. They nest on the ground in temperate and arctic regions and are long- distance migrants. *Great skua, Stercorarius skua (A) *Pomarine jaeger, Stercorarius pomarinus (A) *Parasitic jaeger, Stercorarius parasiticus *Long- tailed jaeger, Stercorarius longicaudus (A) Auks, murres, and puffins Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Alcidae Alcids are superficially similar to penguins due to their black-and-white colours, their upright posture and some of their habits. However, they are not related to the penguins and differ in being able to fly. Auks live on the open sea, only deliberately coming ashore to nest. *Common murre, Uria aalge (A) Gulls, terns, and skimmers Order: CharadriiformesFamily: Laridae Laridae is a family of medium to large seabirds, the gulls, terns, and skimmers. Gulls are typically grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They have stout, longish bills and webbed feet. Terns are a group of generally medium to large seabirds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head.

This small shallow loch is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is located beside the village of the same name in the east of Fife, within a mile to the north of the coastal village of Elie. The loch appears to be a comparatively recent feature, the earliest reference being to \\"the gret loch callit of auld the Reidmyre\\" (Scots: red or reed peat bog) in 1599 and referred to as Keanwchar Loch by 1654 in Blaeu's Atlas Novus. Samples of the loch bed support its origin as a bog and there is archaeological evidence and a local tradition that fuel was extracted. Westward outflow to the Cocklemill Burn is said to have been blocked by sand in 1624 or 1625 but it is drained to the south-east by the largely underground Loch Run into Elie harbour and eastwards to the Inverie Burn. It is an approximate rounded square in shape, and is unusual in that it has no visible inflow, yet is not stagnant. It is the subject of a study by St. Andrews University. It has been theorised that an underground spring feeds into the loch, maintaining a degree of freshness sufficient to offset its stagnation. In former times it was reported to produce large pike and eels, although this is now no longer verifiable as no fishing is allowed, due to its SSSI status. Large numbers of overwintering wildfowl use Kilconquhar Loch as a roost. It was charted during the Bathymetrical Survey of the Fresh-Water Lochs of Scotland, constructed under the direction of Sir John Murray and Laurence Pullar during the years 1897 to 1909.

Lakshmi, Jayabharathi, R. N. Jayagopal, Nagesh, Praveen Kumar and Santhana Bharathi playing other significant roles. The film was a blockbuster and completed 175-day run at the box office. The film tells a story of quadruplets, Michael, Mathanagopal, Kameshwaran, and Raju, all played by Kamal Haasan. Kamal distinguished each of those characters with his body language and language lingo. Michael has a husky voice and an aggressive demeanor, Mathana has a British accent with a sophisticated upper-class personality, Kameshwaran speaks Palakkad Tamil and has a naive, childish personality while Raju speaks Madras Tamil and has an outgoing, cheerful personality; all in keeping with their diverse upbringing as per the plot. The character played by an actress Urvashi was well received by the audience and still considered as one of the best comic role played ever by a heroine. The film was dubbed into Telugu as Michael Madana Kama Raju.  Plot  Venugopal, a wealthy industrialist, marries a woman named Sushila and they have quadruplets. His brother Nandagopal tries to have her and the newborns killed by hired goons. However, the leader of the goons has no desire to kill the babies, so he adopts one (Michael), leaves one in an orphanage (Raju), one in a temple (Kameshwaran) who is picked by Palakkad Mani Iyer, a Brahmin, and one (Madhan) in a car that belongs to Venugopal. 30 years later, Madhan is now a London-educated businessman. Venugopal has raised Madhan as his adopted son, not knowing that he is his biological son. Venugopal is killed by Nandagopal and his nephew, Ramu for his inheritance, but unknown to them, the will has already named Madhan as the beneficiary. Madhan returns to Bangalore from England to take over his father's company. He confronts Avinashi, his father's PA, over his embezzlement, while reluctantly promising to forgive him if Avinashi accepted his culpability. Meanwhile, in Chennai, Michael, like his foster father, has become a petty criminal, and while escaping with his foster father from the police, accidentally causes a fire in an art gallery where artist Shalini's paintings are being displayed for exhibition. This brings in the firefighter, Raju, who saves Shalini and her paintings, leading to romance. Raju is also in debt to a money-lender over a failed stage play. While evading him, Kameshwaran is introduced as a cook for weddings and special events. He meets Thirupurasundari and her kleptomaniac grandmother. Eventually, Kameshwaran marries Thirupurasundari. Someone contacts Madhan over the phone and tells him that his father's death was no accident, but that it was planned, and gives him an address in Chennai and a time to meet. After some distractions involving a woman named Chakkubai and her mother Gangubai, Madhan meets the caller, Sushila, who, unknown to him, is his biological mother. While escaping from goons sent by Ramu in a car, Madhan meets Raju and hires him to impersonate him in Bangalore while Madhan investigates in Chennai. Meanwhile, Ramu and Nandagopal have hired Michael to kill Madhan. Michael sabotages Madhan's car, not realising it is Raju and not Madhan. The brakes fail on the highway, but Raju brings the car to a safe stop. Sushila meets with him thinking he is Madhan, but he redirects her to the real Madhan in Chennai. Raju, Shalini, and her father arrive at Madhan's house in Bangalore. Raju confiscates Avinashi's money not knowing Madhan's deal with Avinashi. Meanwhile, Michael finds the real Madhan in Chennai. Madhan and Chakkubai have fallen in love and Madhan presents her with a ring; unknown to them, they are being spied on by Michael and his foster father. Michael follows Madhan, Chakkubai, Gangubai, and Sushila to Sushila's home where it is revealed that Madhan's father is alive but dazed from the assassination attempt. Michael and his foster father arrive at the scene. Sushila recognises the father as the person who had taken her quadruplets and realises that Michael and Madhan are both her biological sons. Michael and his father knock all of them unconscious and kidnap Madhan and the others to a mountain cabin near Bangalore. Avinashi chances upon Kameshwaran on his wedding day, and hires him to impersonate Madhan to retrieve the money that Raju confiscated. Back in Madhan's house in Bangalore, Raju and Shalini plan to meet without her father knowing. Avinashi drugs Raju's soup but the soup is drunk by Madhan's bodyguard Bheem. Raju and Shalini meet and profess their love for one another. Michael and his father arrive at Madhan's house to loot it. Michael sees Raju, mistakes him for Madhan, and thinks that Madhan has escaped from the cabin. He knocks Raju unconscious. Avinashi sees the unconscious Raju, assumes it was the effect of his drugged soup, and brings Kameshwaran into the house to retrieve his money. Kameshwaran is mistaken for Raju by Shalini who then tries to get intimate with him. Thirupu and her grandmother drag Kameshwaran away from her. Shalini then witnesses Kameshwaran hugging Thirupu. This enrages her as she thinks that Raju is two-timing her. To add to the hilarity, Chakkubai and Gangubai also arrive at the house in search of Madhan. Chakkubai mistakes Kameshwaran for Madhan and introduces herself to everyone as Madhan's fianc√©e, much to Avinashi's dismay, as his plan of using Kameshwaran to access Madhan's money keeps getting comically disrupted first by Raju's then by Madhan's girlfriend. Shalini takes a hunting rifle and holds everyone at gunpoint. Avinashi and the rest try to tell her that Kameshwaran is not Madhan/Raju but she does not believe them. Meanwhile, the real Madhan has escaped the cabin with his parents and comes to the house. In the midst of all this confusion, Michael steals Madhan's wealth and escapes to the cabin. The rest of the crew follows them back to the cabin in multiple cars. Ramu and Nandagopal are already present in the cabin and hold everyone at gunpoint as they arrive one by one. All four brothers are finally in the same room at the same time and Sushila tells them that they are her quadruplets. The presence of all the people in the small cabin causes it to tilt over the cliff edge. The bad men are knocked out and the four brothers work together to safely get everyone out of the cabin. Everyone is happy as they are finally together.

For portraying Michael, Haasan grew his hair long and sported a French beard; for Madhan, he wore glasses and was clean-shaven; for Kameshwaran (also clean- shaven), he brushed his hair back and applied a vibhuti tilaka on his forehead; for Raju, he kept his mustache thick and hair short. Nagesh initially wanted to play a different role from the PA Avinashi, but when Haasan asked him if he would play his role, Nagesh retorted, \\"As if you'd give me that if I asked you for it!\\" He was interested in playing Thirupurasundari's kleptomaniac grandmother before S. N. Lakshmi was cast.  Filming  The song \\"Sundari Neeyum\\" was filmed entirely in slow-motion with 48 frames. Singeetham initially wanted the picturisation with 20 widows in background however he changed the idea after hearing the tune of the song. The climax sequence, featuring a \\"cliff-hanging-house\\", was based on a similar scene from the American film The Gold Rush (1925). The exterior portion was shot in Coonoor and the interior of the house was shot in studio, in a hydraulic set.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack consists of five memorable songs composed by Ilayaraja. K. J. Yesudas was supposed to sing Sundari Neeyum, but due to his busy schedule Ilaiyaraaja insisted on Kamal Hassan singing the song. \\"Rum Bum Bum\\" is yet another fast melody and is a huge hit in college setting till date. The soundtrack also had two songs \\"Mathapoovu Oru Penna\\" and \\"Aadi Pattam Thedi\\" which were not picturised.  Telugu Track list  The film was dubbed into Telugu with the same title. Ilayaraja composed the music with Rajashri penning all the lyrics.  Release  Michael Madana Kama Rajan was released on 17 October 1990, Diwali day. It was commercially successful and ran for 175 days, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu under the title Michael Madana Kama Raju.  Legacy  Singer Mahathi posted an appreciation note on actors of this movie Kamal Haasan and actress Urvashi after watching it, \\"I have always loved the ‚ÄòCrazy‚Äô Mohan and Kamal Hassan combination. Especially in Michael Madana Kamarajan where Kamal brings out so much from every character, playing it so different from the other.\\" Actor Prithviraj posted, \\"Very very few films make you happier than Michael Madana Kamarajan, Kamal Haasan is one of world cinema's greatest and Urvashi is a legend!\\". Actress Vidya Balan posted, \\"Rewatched one of favourite films Michael Madana Kamarajan with Siddharth. The one and only Kamal Haasan and one of my all-time favourite, Urvashi\\".

Origins  Hinckley & Rugby Building Society's history dates back to 1861 when the Rugby Provident Building Society was founded. Much of the Rugby's history was lost when it was merged with its Hinckley counterpart in 1983. The Hinckley Freehold Land and Permanent Building Society opened for business in November 1865, managed by Thomas Kiddle from his draper‚Äôs shop in Castle Street, Hinckley. The society changed its name to The Hinckley Permanent Building Society in 1907, still run by the family. In 1959, Geoffrey Kiddle moved on, ending the Kiddle family‚Äôs almost century-long association with the Society.Hinckley and Rugby Building Society's company records The Society‚Äôs first proper branch opened in 1964 in Friar Lane, Leicester, swiftly followed by further branches in South Wigston and Barlestone. A new head office was built in Upper Bond Street, Hinckley, and officially opened in 1970. The Society can still be found to this day at 37 Castle Street, a Grade II listed building dating back to the 18th century. In 1979, the Society‚Äôs name changed once more to Hinckley Building Society. Three years later in 1982 it was agreed to merge with the Rugby Provident Building Society and, on 1 March 1983 it became Hinckley & Rugby Building Society. 21st century By the end of 2017 the Hinckley & Rugby Building Society had mortgage lending of ¬£193 million and a retail savings balance of ¬£576 million. Assets had increased to a value of ¬£741 million. Pre-tax profits in 2016 were ¬£341,000, increasing to ¬£1.3 million in 2017. Colin Fyfe, formerly Chief Executive of the Darlington Building Society, became Chief Executive of Hinckley & Rugby in November 2018, taking over following the retirement of Chris White, who had held the post for the previous 11 years. In June 2019 the Society moved to a new state-of-the-art Head Office in Upper Bond Street, Hinckley, after acquiring and converting the former Hinckley Magistrates Court building.

Alison Greene and her sister Anne, the college currently caters for approximately 1,257 students from Preschool to Year 12. Moreton Bay College is affiliated with the Association of the Heads of independent schools of Australia (AHISA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Alliance of Girls' Schools Australasia (AGSA), and first became a member of the Queensland Girls' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA) in 1941. Its brother school is Moreton Bay Boys' College. History The school's basketball team in the early 1900s Moreton Bay College was founded in 1901 by Miss Alice J. Alison Greene and her sister Anne, in a school specially designed and built by their father. Its location was in the heart of Wynnum town, on Bay Terrace, bounded by Charlotte and Florence Streets. The school was originally called Moreton Bay Girls' High School and was intended to provide, in addition to classrooms and other rooms, boarding facilities for thirty boarders. The first roll contained six boarders and twenty day scholars. In 1944, the Greene family handed the school over to the Methodist Church and for a year and a half Miss Elsie Greene was acting headmistress. The Methodist Church gave the school to the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools' Association to administer and they appointed Miss Ellen Christensen in 1946 to the headship. Miss Christensen was the headmistress from 1946 to 1949 but family illness led to her absence, during which time Miss Popple was acting principal. Eventually Millicent Drewe was appointed and was headmistress from 1950 to 1964. By 1956 the roll was 150 with twenty-seven candidates for Junior Public Examination. Girls did not sit for Senior until 1959 when there were 167 pupils in all. In 1957, the name was changed to Moreton Bay College, to avoid confusion with the State High School system and to be more in keeping with the college names of the other PMSA schools. The college roll in the early 1960s hovered around the 180 mark, as the facilities were strictly limited and no more could be accommodated. The site was only one and a quarter acres, so while this was a period of great expansion in numbers in the other QGSSSA girls' schools, Moreton Bay College remained a small school and found it harder to meet growing commitments in an ever-expanding QGSSSA competition. Eventually, in the early 1970s, Moreton Bay College withdrew from QGSSSA sport on the understanding that it could return when numbers increased sufficiently. In 1965, after a period as acting head, Viola Owen-Winchester was appointed principal. From time to time there was talk of moving the school to a property at the southern end of Manly Road, but nothing came of it. The rural recession hit hard at what was essentially a boarding school with a small day component. In 1975, with the roll down to 125, the PMSA decided to close the college. Although this decision was rescinded soon after, great damage was done. Parents withdrew their daughters, teachers left and in 1976 there were 65 girls at the school. The faith of those who remained was staunch indeed and none were stauncher than Winchester who battled, with the aid of the parents and friends, to keep the college open. Eventually, the Uniting Church assumed responsibility for the college and set up a new Board with a strong local content, under the Chairmanship of Mr John Mason. Under Letters Patent, issued in August 1979, Moreton Bay College was reconstituted. In that year the roll stood at 116. At the beginning of 1980, following the retirement of Owen- Winchester, Mr Ken Waller was appointed headmaster, the first male principal in the college's history. The languishing boarding house, down to fifteen in 1980 and so much the core of Moreton Bay College's tradition, was closed by the Board, with regret, at the end of 1980. At the end of 1981, the college acquired 20 hectares of hillside land in Wondall Road and the Board began planning the removal of the college to the new site. It was decided to do this in two stages, with the Primary School to move first. During 1983, the Primary buildings were erected and were occupied on the first day of school in 1984. Towards the end of 1985, the Secondary School was built. The Secondary pupils began the 1986 school year on the new site. At the close of 1998, Mr Ken Waller retired after nineteen years of leadership of the college. In his time the college flourished, with significant growth and expansion occurring in the late 1980s and into the 1990s. Mr Paul Teys was appointed principal from the start of the school year in 1999. During that year the Leita Boswell Hall, a primary school sports and general performance hall, was opened and dedicated in honour of Leita Boswell (Beattie), head of primary from 1981 to 1997. The following year, a prep facility was built adjacent to the Hargreaves Road entrance to the college. The college celebrated its centenary in 2001, with an enrolment in its 100th year of 1170 girls from Prep to Year 12. During this time, a number of changes in curriculum emerged, including TAFE and school- based traineeships, expanding the curricular offerings. In 2002, the college swim team won the much sought after QGSSSA Swimming title; the MBC Centre of Excellence in Gymnastics was established, and to complete a very good year, the Seniors of 2002 achieved the highest number and proportion of OP 1 and 2 (used for Tertiary Entry) on record. In April 2003, the college opened its own chapel for the first time in 102 years. The chapel was formerly the Upper Brookfield Uniting Church, which closed in November 2001. MBC Child Care, a long day care centre providing full care for boys and girls from 15 months, as well as outside school hours care and vacation care, was also opened in 2003. In addition, the establishment of Moreton Bay Boys' College in collaboration with the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association (PMSA). At the opening of 2004, the college roll was at record levels: 1220 across the P-12 campus. In August 2004, construction began on the music centre and concert hall, an outstanding acquisition for the college. This wonderful facility was officially opened in February 2006, and significantly enhanced the college‚Äôs already outstanding Music Program. In March 2005, Mr Teys completed his tenure at the college. Mr McLay (deputy principal) acted as principal for the remainder of the year, during which time the board of governors appointed Ms Jennifer Haynes as principal from the commencement of 2006. In 2007, Moreton Bay College won both the Mollie Gould Cup for Swimming and the Stephens Trophy for Athletics for the first time in MBC history. This feat was repeated in 2008. In 2009, Moreton Bay College swimmers lived up to their reputation by taking out the Mollie Gould Cup for the fifth consecutive year, totally an impressive seven times over the past eight years. The graduates of 2006 and 2007 achieved outstanding results, which saw MBC described as ‚Äòthe most successful of the state‚Äôs all-girls schools‚Äù. In 2008, the results of the graduating class saw MBC earn the title of ‚ÄúQueensland‚Äôs No. 1 Academic Achiever for 2008‚Äù by The Courier-Mail. While Moreton Bay Boys‚Äô College remained fully independent of MBC in its management, in 2008, Moreton Bay College assumed full financial responsibility for the college. Through inclusive consultation, a renewed strategic plan 2009‚Äì2013 was released in 2008. In July 2011, Moreton Bay College and Moreton Bay Boys‚Äô College amalgamated. The two Colleges were constitutionally joined by a common Board membership, under the leadership of chair of the board, Mr Geoff Diehm. Ms Jennifer Haynes was appointed as principal of both schools with focus being on developing alignment as appropriate across the two schools, strategic development, staff employment and financial oversight with the assistance of the cross schools' Director of Business and Finance, Helen Gabriel. In 2012, Dr. Deborah Priest was appointed as the inaugural head of college at Moreton Bay College to oversee its daily operations and implementation of the budget and to feed into the strategic planning of the college. Current enrolments for 2013 are at approximately 1200 students. Curriculum The school's curriculum for Years Prep to 12, is based around eight main Learning Areas: English, Mathematics, Science, SOSE, Languages, Technology, Personal Development, and the Arts. In the Senior Years, students are offered more choice, with 25 Authority subjects, four Authority-Registered subjects and Externally based Vocational courses, and a Personal Development program.

Akbari broke away from Hezbe Wahdat when he struck an agreement with the Taliban, offering him a degree of control in Hazara areas . Foundation The party emerged in the early 1990s out of a split in the Hezbe Wahdat leadership between Muhammad Akbari and Abdul Ali Mazari. Tensions between Akbari and Mazari dated back to the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, when Akbari and Mazari had led competing factions within the overarching Tehran Eight Shiite alliance. Akbari had led the Revolutionary Guards, whilst Mazari had led the Nasr Organization. Both parties each had approximately 1,500 fighters, although Nasr had a larger support base; 4,000 compared to Akbari's 2,000. Later, in 1989, Akbari and Mazari agreed to merge their respective parties into Hezbe Wahdat, alongside the other members of the Tehran Eight. Tensions between the various components of Hezbe Wahdat re- emerged at the parties September 1994 leadership election. Both Akbari and Mazari wished to hold the election in their own respective power bases; Hazarjat for Akbari and Kabul for Mazari. Mazari ultimately won out, and the election was held in Kabul, and saw Mazari elected leader with 43 votes in comparison to the 33 cast in favour of Akbari. The results saw Mazari elected as Secretary General whilst Akbari took over as Chairperson of Hezbe Wahdat's Central Committee. In his new position Mazari advocated in favour of maintaining Hezbe Wahdat's alliance with Hizbi-Islami and Junbish-i-Milli. In contrast Akbari, distressed at high Hazara casualties in the ongoing Battle of Kabul, advocated forming a new alliance with Jamiat-e Islami. Immediately following Akbari was accused of plotting a coup, and was rebuffed by Mazari. Within weeks of the election Akbari was running his own group, which allied with Jamiat-e Islami. Ideology Akbari supported the Shia Family Law, which has been accused of legalizing spousal rape.

Its generic name originates from the Latin word, vacca (cow), since the first Mycobacterium strain was cultured from cow dung in Austria. Mycobacterium vaccae originates from the Ugandan Lang'o District, where locals claimed that a \\"muddy substance had the power to cure a number of ailments\\". Research areas being pursued with regard to killed Mycobacterium vaccae vaccine include immunotherapy for allergic asthma, cancer, depression, leprosy, psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema and tuberculosis. A research group at Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol, Bristol, England, UK has shown that Mycobacterium vaccae stimulated a newly discovered group of neurons, increased levels of serotonin and decreased levels of anxiety in mice. Other researchers fed live Mycobacterium vaccae to mice, then measured their ability to navigate a maze compared to control mice not fed the bacteria. \\"Mice that were fed live M. vaccae navigated the maze twice as fast and with less demonstrated anxiety behaviors as control mice\\", according to Dorothy Matthews, who conducted the research with Susan Jenks at the Sage Colleges, Troy, New York, USA. Mycobacterium vaccae is in the same genus as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium which causes tuberculosis. Numerous trials have indicated that exposure to oral and injectable products derived from M. vaccae bacteria can have positive effects in treating tuberculosis. Although a 2002 review of selected clinical trials failed to find any consistent benefit of certain dosage regimens of injectable Mycobacterium products in people with tuberculosis, a more recent meta-analysis of 54 clinical studies of M. vaccae products for tuberculosis showed treatment resulted in improved sputum conversion and radiological (X-ray) assessment. Medical researchers at Kharkiv National Medical University, Kharkiv, Ukraine have reported two clinical trials with oral formulations of Immunitor Inc's killed Mycobacterium vaccae oral vaccine and An Hui Longcom's killed Mycobacterium vaccae oral vaccine in treating tuberculosis, including drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). The research team reported greater success with the Immunitor vaccine than the An Hui Longcom vaccine. A successful Phase III clinical trial of Tubivac is published. A team of researchers at the Genetics and Microbiology Department of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain discovered that Mycobacterium vaccae changes from its \\"smooth\\" type to its \\"rough\\" type (referring to how colonies of this organism appear under a microscope) at thirty degrees Celsius. They discovered that the \\"smooth\\" type of Mycobacterium vaccae has a substance on the outside of its cell wall which interferes with the production of Th-1 cytokines, responsible for some kinds of T-helper cell immune response. The team also found that the spleen cells of mice inoculated with \\"rough\\" Mycobacterium vaccae produced more Th-1 cytokines than those inoculated with \\"smooth\\" Mycobacterium vaccae. The researchers say this may explain why different vaccines made from Mycobacterium vaccae vary in their effectiveness in increasing immune response to other organisms during clinical trials. A study conducted in 2017-2018 revealed that Mycobacterium vaccae lysate may prevent the development of atopic dermatitis symptoms when applied topically. in In a 2019 study, scientists identified a lipid called 10(Z)-hexadecenoic acid found in Mycobacterium vaccae, and discovered that inside stimulated immune cells (macrophages), the lipid binds to the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor, inhibiting a number of key pathways which drive inflammation.

It marks the southern end of Friedrichstra√üe. Until 1970 both Lindenstra√üe and Wilhelmstrasse led into it. In 1947 it was renamed after the publicist Franz Mehring (1846‚Äì1919). Location of Mehringplatz within Friedrichstadt, Berlin Mehringplatz is one of three prominent squares laid out about 1730 in the course of the city's Baroque extension under King Frederick William I of Prussia, along with Pariser Platz (former Karree) and Leipziger Platz (Octagon). Due to its circular shape, Mehringplatz was initially named Rondell; but on 22 October 1815, it was renamed Belle-Alliance-Platz after the Battle of La Belle Alliance, an alternative name for the Battle of Waterloo that was then popular in Prussia. Rondell was the southern entrance to Berlin via Hallesches Tor, a gate on the newer city wall on the outbound road to Halle. The circus was refurbished during the 1830s, including the erection of the Friedenss√§ule (\\"Peace Column\\") with a statue of Victoria by Christian Daniel Rauch in 1843. The area was completely devastated in World War Two, particularly in an air raid on 3 February 1945 and the Battle of Berlin which followed. In the 1960s, Mehringplatz was redeveloped as a pedestrian zone that would anchor a large social housing area according to the realization of a plan conceived by Hans Scharoun, which was ultimately executed by the Berlin architect . During the 1990s, the installation of striking murals was used to decorate the lower walls of the courtyard areas of the housing blocks.

The $10 million event, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation, was a showcase for all sorts of transportation-related technologies. Over a million visitors flocked to the show from all over the world. According to the Wall Street Journal, it was \\"the biggest show the government has put on since World War II.\\"Rothschild 1972 Transpo hosted the world's largest air show, all of the new widebody airliners, high-speed trains and demonstrations of the latest automated guideway transit systems. In addition to featuring futuristic technology \\"Flying trains, square dancing helicopters and the fantasy of a wonderland,\\" according to a news release, Transpo '72 covered all current modes of transportation as well. General Manager William J. Bird explained, \\"We want to emphasize totally integrated systems in our future transportation...\\"Living The event was officially opened by the second U.S. Secretary of Transportation, John Volpe. Background Transpo was the idea of L. Mendel Rivers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Rivers had visited the Paris Air Show on occasion; at the time, there were a \\"ring\\" of three major air shows in Europe that took turns hosting, Farnborough, Paris and Hanover. Visitors from around the world could come to the show where sales teams from the aviation firms were ready to sign deals for their latest products. Rivers lamented the fact that there was no similar industry-based show in the U.S. Rivers started planning a U.S. version of the air/trade show, and selected Washington as a natural location due to the density of military contacts and the presence of the recently expanded Dulles Airport. Rivers went to Congress with a request for $750,000 in funding. However, this was during an era of rapid shifts within the aviation industry. The winding-down of major purchases to feed the Vietnam War and Project Apollo was forcing the major aerospace firms to seek ways to diversify, and the government was actively funding a number of mass transit projects in partnership with them. Rivers changed the focus to be a show about any form of transit, not just aircraft, and the size and cost started to increase. He won an initial appropriation of $3 million for the show, but had to return to Congress for another $2 million to keep it on track as its scale rapidly increased. Critics, notably William Proxmire, attacked the event\\"Transpo '72 Sets Clouded Departure\\", St. Petersburg Times, 2 May 1972 and claimed that the actual costs would be closer to $10 million when industry input was considered.Rothschild 1972 By the time the show was ready it had expanded greatly, including not only displays but industry meetings, open seminars and hosts of presentations large and small. The official program was 80 pages.\\"Transpo 72 : official program\\" Pre-show estimates of visitors ranged about the 1 million mark or larger.\\"Tampans Flying to Transpo 72 in Washington\\", The Evening Independent, 18 May 1972 Final attendance was put at 1.25 million. Aircraft The show included displays from major aviation firms showing their latest aircraft. On the first day, the prototype Boeing 707, the \\"Dash 80\\", arrived at the airport on its way to becoming an exhibit at the Smithsonian. The same day, BOAC announced its first official order for five Concordes.Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 778 Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed and Boeing all used the show as a sales platform for their latest designs, the DC-10, L-1011 and 747. Douglas and Lockheed had recently started deliveries, and flew in production versions of their aircraft for the show directly from the assembly line. Numerous military aircraft also arrived, including the C-5 Galaxy. Airbus Industrie arrived at the show to promote their A300, claiming that the longer-ranged A-300B-4 variant would present strong competition in the U.S. domestic market due to operating costs being 5 to 7% lower than the L-1011 and DC-10 trijets. Noting that the original contract that led to the trijets had called for a twin-engine aircraft, Ken Gordon of Airbus North America claimed that the original specification still needed to be filled.Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 783 The third engine of the US designs gave them the ETOPS performance needed for trans-Atlantic flights, but were unneeded for flights within North America, which the 300 could meet with lower operational costs. Douglas and Lockheed responded by using the show to pitch two-engine versions of their three-engine designs to compete with the A300. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry had been trying to develop a shorter-range airliner they called the \\"YX\\" for some time, but had backed away from talks with Boeing after the value of the Yen fluctuated. Lockheed announced that they were going to approach Japan and the government-owned Air Canada to develop a two-engined version of the L-1011 as a way of filling both the \\"YX\\" needs as well as for domestic flights within Canada. The \\"BiStar\\" was shorter, had new wings and tail, and was powered by two upgraded RB-211-X engines, which Lockheed was already developing for the extended-range L-1011-2.Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 779 Douglas, recently purchased by McDonnell, had also been pitching a two-engine version of the DC-10, which combined the body of the -10 with the wings of the -30, along with the upgraded CF6-50 engine. Interest had been tepid when the idea was first floated, but with Lockheed's and Airbus' aggressive moves they once again brought the idea forward.Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 780 Boeing was coy on the topic of a smaller 747, but suggested they were instead looking at an entirely new design, a \\"long thin\\" aircraft similar to an enlarged twin- engine 707. In the end, Japan Air Lines' YX needs were filled with 747-100SR, for \\"short range\\", which added passenger capacity at the cost of range. Boeing's \\"long, thin\\"Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 781 design would emerge as the Boeing 757 - it was the only one of the proposed twins to actually ship. Small designs at the show included several smaller jets, notably the North American debut of the Fokker F.28, several business jets including the IAI Commodore (soon to be known as the Westwind), British Aerospace BAe 125, and the propeller-powered Fairchild Hiller FH-227, Britten-Norman Trislander and DeHavilland Twin Otter.Ramsden & Woolley 1972, pg. 782 NASA and the FAA also had a major presence at the show, demonstrating their efforts to lower the noise and pollution of air travel. One major program at that time was the microwave landing system, which would allow aircraft to approach from much wider angles and avoid stacking them up over a single approach vector, spreading out the noise. They also demonstrated new engine technologies and stated that the widely used JT8D fleet would be free of smoke by 1972. A combination of these technologies, along with supercritical wings, composites and artificially stable control systems would improve fuel economy of future airliners by 60%. Major avionics firms also attended in force. Goodyear brought their STARAN computer, originally developed for missile interception and similar duties, but now being pitched as an air traffic control (ATC) system that would optionally use a computer-generated voice to automatically send traffic advisories to pilots. Plessey was showing their ACR 430 radar for smaller airfields, and with Lockheed they were demonstrating their then- incomplete automated ATC system based on a Lockheed MAC-16 minicomputer. The United States Coast Guard displayed their Air Cushion Vehicle hovercraft at the expo, where tens of thousands of visitors examined it every day. The craft also conducted a daily test flight in front of thousands of onlookers, making it the first Coast Guard vehicle of its kind to do so. The Coast Guard estimates that 1.2 million people saw the Air Cushion Vehicle over the course of the whole expo. AGT systems During the 1960s the government had spent an increasing amount of development funding on automated guideway transit (AGT) systems as a solution to providing mass transit in smaller cities and suburbs of larger ones. At the same time, aerospace companies in the U.S. were suffering from a lack of projects as the Vietnam War wound down and the Project Apollo buildout was completed. Groups within the government and industry saw the AGT efforts as a perfect opportunity to diversify. By the time Transpo was being planned, the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA), predecessor of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), had invested $12 million in AGT research, and the companies added another $45 million. In 1970, UMTA felt it was time to move from experiments to prototype installations, and arranged funding for three major installations. One of these would emerge as the Vought Airtrans, another as the Morgantown PRT, and finally the third block of funds provided four companies $1.5 million each to bring their AGT developments to Transpo '72.Edward Weiner, \\"Urban Transportation Planning in the United States\\", Springer, 2008, pg. 89Schneider 2009 Carlos Villarreal, administrator of UMTA, stated that Transpo \\"marks UMTA's entry into the space age of mass transportation.\\" The four chosen systems were the Bendix Dashaveyor, the Ford ACT, TTI Hovair (a spin-off of General Motors) and the Rohr ROMAG, represented by its former rubber-wheeled prototype, the Monocab. Boeing and Vought also showed cars from their larger systems, Boeing's version of the Alden staRRcar being installed in Morgantown, and the Vought Airtrans being installed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Ford would later install a small ACT deployment at a shopping mall in Dearborn, and Dashaveyor would win a contest for the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride, but further sales were not forthcoming. Several European companies also presented models of their designs. The plans to use Transpo as a way to excite mayors into buying the AGT systems failed, a disappointment to both UMTA and Congress. Car companies at the show were sober in their assessments of the future of AGT systems. GM showed a movie about the future of transit in Detroit which clearly put the car in first place. Henry Ford II said that only a \\"limited portion\\" of the Highway Trust Fund should be used for public transportation, and then only for research into \\"new transportation concepts.\\" High-speed rail As part of the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965, the newly formed United States Department of Transportation (DOT) was funding a number of studies into high-speed trains under the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) group. One of these projects was the UAC TurboTrain, which had recently entered service with Canadian National Railways, only to be pulled from service shortly after due to a wide variety of minor problems. One of the two three-car TurboTrain prototypes built for the DOT visited Transpo. However, the DOT was more interested in really high speed trains, and had been funding several developments along these lines for some time. In order to expedite these developments, they had recently selected a parcel of land outside Pueblo, Colorado as a test site that would become the Transportation Technology Center (TTC). They planned on using the TTC to lower the cost of all-up testing of advanced designs, as well as guaranteeing that all the participants would have a level playing field. Several U.S. companies were in the process of building hovertrain systems based on technology licensed from the French A√©rotrain project, known under the U.S. term \\"Tracked Air-Cushion Vehicle\\", or \\"TACV\\", and these were in the process of being set up at the TTC. Several models of proposed developments were shown at Transpo. These included models of Garrett AiResearch's wheeled linear induction motor (LIM) testbed vehicle, drawings of Grumman Aircraft's and General Electric's TACV proposals, and a full-sized mock-up of a futuristic Rohr design. Three of the four designs eventually won contracts and were built to varying degrees at the TTC; Garrett's wheeled vehicle started testing under jet power before the LIM reaction plate was installed, Grumman's vehicle was given an extensive track, but ran out of funding before the planned LIM reaction plate could be installed, and Rohr's vehicle was the last to arrive and received the least build-out with only a mile and a half of LIM-equipped track. Like the PRT systems, none of the TACV proposals would ever see commercial development. British Rail also attended, bringing with them a full-sized mockup of the Advanced Passenger Train, at that point still powered by a gas turbine before its conversion to electric power. In another part of the British pavilion was a display by Tracked Hovercraft, which was starting tests on its track near Cambridge that year. The French exhibit included both the Aerotrain and recent developments of SNCFs high-speed efforts, which would emerge as the TGV. Mass transit Although much of the show was organized to highlight the US's high-tech efforts, UMTA was also involved in a number of more \\"down to earth\\" projects, including the selection of new busses and trams for existing mass transit networks. Three major projects were ongoing, the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle (LRV); the State of the Art Car (SOAC), a prototype subway car that included all of the most modern features; and the Transbus urban mass transit bus. Many of these were being worked on with Boeing Vertol, who showed both the prototype SOAC car and the design of their LRV. Similar vehicles were also being developed by other aviation firms, especially Rohr. Rohr was showing their own subway cars that were being produced for BART and the initial models of their proposals for the Washington Metro, as well as Transbus designs from their recently purchased Flxible bus division, who were working on what would emerge a few years later as the Flxible Metro. The government's funding of the aerospace firms to present at Transpo led Pullman to pull out of the show, complaining that the government was \\"playing wasteful politics by needlessly fostering the entry of companies from the depressed aerospace industry into the rail transit equipment business.\\" Motor Coach Industries (MCI), a Canadian and U.S. bus manufacturer controlled by Greyhound Lines, used the show to introduce their MC-8 \\"Crusader\\" motorcoach, an intercity coach. The model became so popular with both large and small bus operators that General Motors lost its position as the major manufacturer of such buses in North America, exiting the market entirely in 1980, two years after MCI updated the product with its MC-9 model. Vehicle safety The U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was a major participant, including sponsorship of the \\"International Vehicle and Highway Safety Conference,\\" featuring discussions on international cooperation in vehicle and highway safety. A major attraction at Transpo 72 was a consolidated International Experimental Safety Vehicle Exhibit at which twelve different experimental safety vehicles were displayed.\\"Experimental Safety Vehicles at Transpo '72\\" , Proceedings of the Third International Vehicle and Highway Safety Conference, 1972, pg. S-1 - S-25 Air show, fatal accidents Three fatal accidents occurred at the air show. The first accident involved a 'kite', i.e., a variety of hang glider that was being towed by a vehicle. The aircraft suffered a structural failure and collapsed, killing the pilot. The second fatality occurred June 3 during a sport plane pylon race when, during a turn around a pylon, a trailing aircraft's wing and propeller hit the tip of the right wing of a leading aircraft, shearing the leading aircraft's wing off the fuselage. The damaged aircraft crashed almost instantly, killing the pilot, professional Air Racer Hugh C. Alexander of Louisville, GA The third fatal accident occurred on June 4, the last day of the show. Overhead, jet fighters of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, the Navy's Blue Angels and the Royal Air Force's Red Arrows performed dramatic aerial acrobatics. Tragically, the Thunderbirds experienced their first fatal crash at an air show. Major Joe Howard, flying Thunderbird 3 (Phantom F-4E s/n# 66-0321) experienced a loss of power during a vertical maneuver. Although Howard ejected as the aircraft fell back to earth from about tail first, and descended under a good canopy, winds blew him into the blazing crash site. Transpo Trade/Airshows had been planned as recurring events here. Since these fatalities, there have been no other airshows at Dulles International Airport. Records A balloon release of 100,000 balloons at Transpo '72 was the first balloon release to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records.\\"Neil Schwartz: The Balloon Man\\" Howie Keefe set a world speed record for LA to DC in the P-51 Mustang Miss America, finishing at Dulles during the show.

Cunningham, a striker, began his professional career with Lincoln City in 1979. In three years with the Imps, he made 123 league appearances and scored 32 goals. Barnsley came in for his services in 1982, and he went on to make 42 appearances for the South Yorkshire club, scoring eleven goals. After leaving Oakwell, Cunningham remained in the White Rose county, making 28 appearances and scoring five goals for Sheffield Wednesday. In 1984 Cunningham had a short spell with Manchester City before moving to the North East to join Jack Charlton's Newcastle United. He spent two years on Tyneside, making just short of 50 appearances for the Magpies, scoring four goals. He was commonly known to his friends while at Newcastle as 'Slug'. Cunningham traded the North East for the North West in July 1987 when he signed for Sam Ellis' Blackpool for a tribunal-set fee of ¬£25,000. He made his debut for the Seasiders in the opening day of the 1987‚Äì88 season, a draw at Gillingham. What started as a promising Blackpool career became a disappointing one. As the team struggled, Cunningham was made a scapegoat, and at the end of the 1988‚Äì89, he rejoined Ellis, who had become manager of Bury. On his return to Bloomfield Road with the Shakers, on 31 October 1989, Cunningham was sent off in the first half. The visitors, however, won the game by a single goal. After Bury, Cunningham played for Bolton Wanderers, Rotherham United, Doncaster Rovers and Wycombe Wanderers. After almost 500 league games and over one hundred goals, he ended his career with non-league Gainsborough Trinity. Post-retirement Cunningham now lives and works in Lincoln as a solicitor.

Life He held secular positions such as Councillor of Parliament and Chancellor of Francis of Valois, Duke of Touraine. The royal court greatly favoured him and appointed him to numerous ecclesiastical offices. In 1568, he became Bishop of Mende and in 1581, Archbishop of Bourges. King Henry IV of France named him his grand almoner in 1591 and appointed him to the Archbishopric of Sens in 1595; but the pope did not confirm the appointment until 1602. He was a member of the commission instituted by Henry IV in 1600 to reform the University of Paris. By his contemporaries, Renaud de Beaune was considered one of the greatest orators of the time. Posterity rated his work for the pacification of France higher than his oratorical talent. It was his influence that led to the successful issue of the conference of Suresnes, near Paris, in 1593. He promised the conversion of Henry IV and brought about peace between the latter and the \\"League\\". He received the abjuration of the king, and, although the absolution of an excommunicated prince was reserved to the pope, absolved him, July, 1593, on condition, however, that the approval of the Roman authorities should be obtained. In spite of this condition the absolution was invalid, and the action of the archbishop caused, at least partly, the delay in obtaining the papal confirmation of his nomination to the See of Sens.

It drew attention to this disadvantaged group and helped to reduce the number of violent evictions.  Aims  Activists from the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centers (SPARC) such as Sheela Patel and Jockin Arputham joined with the Society for Participatory Research in India (PRIA) in 1985, in order to make census of around 6,000 of the poorest households in Mumbai. The aim was to ascertain the scale and nature of the city's pavement dwellers, since despite being unavoidable on the street, there was little known about who they were or where they came from. It was a transparent process in which the researchers kept the households informed about the census at all stages. Slum dwellings had proliferated in the city, and the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had been granted permission to demolish pavement structures by a Supreme Court ruling.  Findings  We, the Invisible revealed that pavement dwellers were not transient populations, but people who had lived for over two decades in the city. It showed approximately half of the pavement dwellers to be from the poorest districts in the state of Maharashtra, with the other half coming from the poorest parts of wider India. Many came as victims of drought, famine, earthquakes, religious persecution or riots. Most lived in shacks of less than 150 square feet with no electricity or water connection. They paid protection money to gangsters, despite living on municipal land.Development Gateway Foundation: Urban Development: Empowering Slum Dwellers: Interview with Sheela Patel, 7 September 2004 They were ignored by the city administration and could not afford to use public transport, but despite that provided a service to the city by being a source of cheap labour.  Results  As a result of the report, there were no violent evictions of pavement dwellers in Mumbai despite the Supreme Court ruling. Negotiated evictions were facilitated and the group Mahila Milan was set up to represent women. In 1986, 300 households were moved from their shacks on the East Moses Road to the Dindoshi Nagar site in Goregaon. The plots were more spacious, but also rocky and the area was unsafe at night. Having had no choice in being moved, the families were saddened by the experience and this spurred SPARC to find out what people really wanted. Following on from these discussions, four model houses were built and displayed in Byculla for one week. Everyone who had participated in the census was invited to attend and over 5,000 households went. The favourite model was the most expensive, at 16,500 rupees and it was taken to over fifty other similar exhibitions. Also this model was then built by some of the Dindoshi residents on their land.

He was a bishop from 1965 to his retirement in 2004. He was a leading proponent of liberation theology and denounced abuses of human rights by the military regime that controlled Brazil in the anos de chumbo from 1964 to 1985. Lorscheiter was born in S√£o Jos√© do Hort√™ncio, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in the south of Brazil, one of seven brothers. His parents were the descendants of German immigrants. His surname was \\"Lorscheider\\", but it was recorded incorrectly when his birth was registered, and the incorrect \\"Lorscheiter\\" remained with him for the rest of his life. He came from a religious family, and other relatives joined the church: Cardinal Alo√≠sio Lorscheider is a cousin. He attended the local Catholic seminary, at Gravata√≠, from 1939 to 1945, and then studied philosophy at the seminary in S√£o Leopoldo from 1946 to 1948. He studied theology at the Salesian Pontifical University from 1949 to 1953, from which he received a doctorate in 1956. He was ordained in Rome on 20 December 1952. He returned to Brazil to teach at the seminary in Gravata√≠, and was then director of the seminary in Viam√£o. He also taught at the Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio Grande do Sul. Pope Paul VI appointed him as auxiliary bishop of Porto Alegre and titular bishop of Tamada on 12 November 1965, the year after a military dictatorship took control of the country. He was officially ordained the following year: his cousin, Bishop Alo√≠sio Lorscheider, was one of the principal co-consecrators. Lorscheiter was involved in secret negotiations between the church and the military from 1970 to 1974, but also openly criticised the military regime. Hundreds of political opponents were imprisoned, tortured, or killed. He became known as \\"Dom Ivo\\" by his supporters. Pope Paul VI appointed him Bishop of Santa Maria on 5 February 1974. He was secretary-general of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil from 1971 to 1979, and then president until 1987, following immediately after his cousin Alo√≠sio Lorscheider each time. His espousal of liberation theology put him in conflict with Vatican authorities, particularly Pope John Paul II. At a Vatican synod of bishops in 1985, he presented a detailed rebuttal of a critique of liberation theology by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. He said: He suffered from poor health, particularly in later life. He retired on 24 March 2004. He died in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, after stomach surgery.

It was originally built between 1593 and 1609 by the Jesuit order, and it is located adjacent to the Old University Building, which originally housed a Jesuit college known as the Collegium Melitense. The church was rebuilt in the Baroque style by Francesco Buonamici after suffering extensive damage in an explosion in 1634. The church remained in use after the Jesuits were expelled from Malta in 1768, and it is also used for Masters and Doctoral graduation ceremonies of the University of Malta, the successor to the Collegium Melitense. History Construction of the church began in November 1593, when its foundations were laid down. It formed part of a Jesuit complex occupying an entire city block, which also included the Collegium Melitense (now the Old University Building) that was constructed between 1595 and 1602. Construction of the church was completed in 1609. The church's interior On 12 September 1634, a gunpowder factory explosion caused serious damage to both the church and college. Most of the church, including its fa√ßade, was subsequently rebuilt in the Baroque style by the Luccan architect and engineer Francesco Buonamici. Although works continued throughout the 17th century, the fa√ßade still seems to be incomplete. The buildings also suffered some damage during the 1693 Sicily earthquake. The church's interior is decorated using the Doric order. Its plan followed the Church of the Ges√π in Rome, with four-bay nave and seven side chaples; the eighth, Onorati Congregation Chapel, opening from the nave leading to a door onto Archbishop Street. Statue of Saint Ignatius of Loyola The Jesuits were expelled from Malta by Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca in 1768, and the building became property of the Treasury of the Order of St. John. However, the church remained open and a conventual chaplain was chosen to take care of it. Studies at the college also continued, and the University of Malta was established in 1769 to take its place. The church was used for the University's degree conferment ceremonies until the 1960s, when the institution moved to a new campus at Tal-Qroqq in Msida. Masters and Doctoral graduation ceremonies are still held inside the church. The church building is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. The church's interior and exterior were restored between 1996 and 2002, and its fa√ßade, roof and dome were again restored between 2016 and 2018, along with the fa√ßade of the adjacent Old University Building. Artworks The church's altarpiece depicts the Circumcision of Jesus, and it is the work of the Italian artist . The church contains other paintings ranging from the late 16th century to the late 18th century, including works by Baldass Peruzzi, Stefano Erardi, Nicolo de Simoni and Mattia Preti.

Until now, such creation of color centers was reported only in glass fibers . Photodarkening limits the density of excitations in fiber lasers and amplifiers. The experimental results suggest that operating at a saturated regime helps to reduce photodarkening.N. Li; S. Yoo; X. Yu; D. Jain; J. K. Sahu (2014)‚ÄúPump Power Depreciation by Photodarkening in Ytterbium-Doped Fibers and Amplifiers‚Äù, IEEE Photonics Technology Letters, Vol. 26, Issue 2, pp.115-118 Definition One could expect the term photodarkening to refer to any process when any object becomes non-transparent (dark) due to illumination with light. Formally, the darkening of the photo-emulsion also could be considered as photodarkening. However, recent papers use this term meaning reversible creation of absorbing color centers in optical fibers. One may expect that the effect is not specific for fibers; therefore, the definition should cover wide class of phenomena, excluding, perhaps, non-reversible darkening of photographic emulsions. According to the Encyclopedia of Laser Physics and Technology, photodarkening is the effect that the optical losses in a medium can grow when the medium is irradiated with light at certain wavelengths. We may also define photodarkening as reversible creation of absorption centers in optical media at the illumination with light. Photodarkening rate The inverse of the timescale at which photodarkening occurs can be interpreted as photodarkening rate Color centers Usually, photodarkening is attributed to creation of color centers due to resonant interaction of electromagnetic field with an active medium  Possible mechanisms of photodarkening  The phenomenon, similar to photodarkening in fibers, was recently observed in chunks of Yb-doped ceramics and crystals. At the high concentration of excitations, the absorption jumps up, causing the avalanche of the broadband luminescence. Increase of absorption can be caused by formation of color centers by electrons in the conduction band, created by several neighboring excited ions. (The energy of one or two excitations is not sufficient to pop an electron into the conduction band). This explains, why the rate of darkening is strong function of the intensity of the exciting beam (as in the case with optical fibers discussed above). In the experiments, the thermal effects are important; therefore only the initial stage of the avalanche can be interpreted as photodarkening, and such interpretation is not yet confirmed. Recent work pointed out the role of thulium contamination. Through laser pump and signal absorption, and energy transfer from ytterbium; thulium is able to emit UV light, known to create color centers in silica glass. Although the actual mechanism of photodarkening is still unknown, a reliable setup to test the photodarkening properties of different types of fibers has been recently reported.

It is caused by the cercozoan Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea and is widespread in potato growing countries. Symptoms of powdery scab include small lesions in the early stages of the disease, progressing to raised pustules containing a powdery mass. These can eventually rupture within the tuber periderm.Maldonado, M. Loreto Hernandez, Richard E. Falloon, Ruth C. Butler, Anthony J. Conner, and Simon R. Bulman. \\"Resistance to Spongospora Subterranea Induced in Potato by the Elicitor Œ≤-aminobutyric Acid.\\" Australasian Plant Pathol. Australasian Plant Pathology 44.4 (2015): 445-53. Web. 21 Oct. 2015. The powdery pustules contain resting spores that release anisokont zoospores (asexual spore with two unequal length flagella) to infect the root hairs of potatoes or tomatoes. Powdery scab is a cosmetic defect on tubers, which can result in the rejection of these potatoes. Potatoes which have been infected can be peeled to remove the infected skin and the remaining inside of the potato can be cooked and eaten.Dennis A. Johnson and Thomas F. Cummings. Effect of Powdery Scab Root Galls on Yield of Potato. (2015).Plant Disease 99:10, 1396-1403 Disease Cycle In general, not a lot is known about the life cycle of Spongospora subterranea f.sp subterranea (Sss). Most of the currently-proposed life cycle is based on that of Plasmodiophora brassicae, a closely related and better- studied protozoan. It has been proposed, due to this similarity, that there are two distinct stages that Sss can exist as; the asexual and sexual stages. Asexual Stage: A zoospore infects root tissue and becomes a uninucleate plasmodium. This plasmodium undergoes mitotic nuclear division (creates many nuclei within a single cell) and turns into a multinucleate plasmodium. Then, the multinucleate plasmodium forms zoosporangium, which eventually release more zoospores. This process can happen relatively quickly and can act as an important source of secondary inoculum within a field. Sexual Stage: This stage follows a similar pattern to the asexual stage, but with a few exceptions. It is hypothesized that two zoospores fuse together to form a dikaryotic zoospore (with two separate haploid nuclei, n+n) and then infect the roots. Once the infection occurs, the dikaryotic zoospore develops into a binucleate plasmodium (one pair on nuclei, n+n). Similar to the asexual stage, this plasmodium will also replicate its nucleus to create a multinucleate plasmodium (many pairs of nuclei, n+n). The second main different between stages occurs here. The pairs of nuclei (n+n) will fuse by karyogamy, and the plasmodium will quickly divide into numerous resting spores within a sporosori (spore sack, alternatively called cystosori). These resting spores have three- layered walls and are extremely resistant to the environment, allowing them to persist in the soil for longer than 10 years. As a reminder, most of the life cycle is still unclear. However, the presence of zoospores, plasmodia, zoosporangia, and resting spores have been observed in the field and lab. The ploidy levels and karyogamy events are only theorized and have yet to be proven. Environment Spongospora subterranea pathogenesis is most effective in cool, damp environments, such as northern Britain, the Columbia Basin of south-central Washington, and north-central Oregon. The environmental condition is particularly critical during the release of infective agents (zoospores) into the soil-environment . Upon release from resting spores, zoospores require moisture to swim towards the host tuber or roots. One study, found powdery scab was significantly more common on plants grown in constant dampness compared to plants grown with varying moisture levels. In this same study she concluded disease risk was related more to the environment, or moisture level, than the level of inoculum present. Inoculum may be present but not able to disperse due to environmental conditions, and therefore does not reach host tissue to infect. Other environmental factors that affect Spongospora subterranea infection are directly related to agronomic practices. Increased use of fertilizers containing nitrate or ammonium nitrogen increase the incidence and severity of powdery scab. It is thought that the fertilization increases root growth, and thus provides more tissue for infection and disease cycling to occur. Also, reduced cellulose within the cell walls caused by excess nitrogen may increase susceptibility of host to infection. It is apparent that the environment can directly affect both the host susceptibility and the dispersal of the pathogen ultimately setting the pace for the disease cycle. Pathogenesis Potato tuber covered in powdery scabs S. subterranea is an obligate parasite phytomyxea that infects the below ground structures of the host. Infection leads to hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the host cells and eventual bursting. However, the mechanism behind this is still unknown. Zoospores infect the root hairs by attaching to the outer surface, encysting, and then penetrating the epidermis through lenticels and stomata. Once inside, the multinucleate plasmodium divides to spread and produce more zoospores. The plasmodium causes the infected host cells to multiply rapidly and enlarge into a gall. This rapid multiplication also produces uninucleate cells that aggregate together as sporosori. The sporosori look like a powdery mass within the gall, which gives this disease its name. Eventually the gall swells and bursts out the epidermis of the tuber, releasing the spores back into the soil. Gall severity depends on inoculum level, environment, and potato skin type. Infection is most prevalent in the early stages of tuber formation while the potato tissue is unsuberized. But, infection can occur at all stages on development. White and red skinned potatoes and highly susceptible while russet skinned are somewhat resistant. Russet skin is thicker and has higher levels of the LOX protein which is used as a marker for resistance. There is little known about variation and sexual recombination within S. subterranea, therefore high priority is given to researching the variations within potato cultivars for researching host/pathogen relationships and management. Importance Powdery Scab has important implications for commercial farming. Not only does the pathogen itself cause harm, but the pathogen is also a vector for potato mop-top virus, another plant pathogen. As a result, its presence greatly threatens potato yield for farmers. The burst pustules can also act as a wound for other fungi to infect, such as Phytophthora erythroseptica and Phytophthora infestans. Thus, tubers with powdery scab can have increased incidences of other devastating diseases, including pink rot, dry rot, black dot, and late blight. Potato tubers will form powdery scab pustules that inhibit their ability to be sold. Many markets decline to buy potatoes with ugly scarring even if they are safe to eat. Research has not yet found an effective way to peel the scabs without damaging the potato. Potatoes that are rejected for sale create a large financial burden on farmers. Additionally, because soil borne inoculum can survive for years as spores, the pathogen is very difficult to eliminate once present. In Great Britain a recent Potato Council funded diagnostic project discovered that as much as 82% of fields tested positive for soil inoculum. Management S. subterranea currently has no effective chemical controls. Therefore, other cultural management techniques must be used. Using certified clean seeds and planting in fields that have been historically healthy is the best form of control. These methods may prevent infestation from resting spores. Since infection is promoted by cool soil temperatures and high soil moisture, delayed planting can also help reduce negative effects of the pathogen. Delayed planting reduces the growth period in cooler soils subsequently decreasing germination of the spores. One limitation to this method is an additional decrease of early market yield. Pre-planting chemigation with metam sodium can reduce the propagules of the pathogen.\\"How to Manage Pests.\\" UC IPM: UC Management Guidelines for Powdery Scab on Potato. N.p., n.d. Web. 19 Oct. 2015. Other common means of control include using resistant potatoes and crop rotations. Several cultivars of resistant potatoes include Granola, Nicola, Ditta, and Gladiator.C. R. Brown, G. Vandemark, D. Johnson, Tom Cummings, Dallas Batchelor, Jeff Miller, Chris Olsen. Resistance to Powdery Scab in Potato. Web. 11 Nov. 2015. Because soil-borne inoculum can survive for many years, crop rotations should involve alternate species that will promote a partial life cycle of the pathogen. This way the zoospores will germinate without producing new spores.Nitzan, Nadav, Dennis Johnson, Dallas Batchelor, and Chuck Brown. \\"Powdery Scab.\\" Potato Country (2007): 6-7. Print. Researchers have investigated the use of beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) in promoting potato resistance. BABA triggers a plants systemic acquired resistance (SAR), a natural plant defense mechanism. When potatoes are inoculated with BABA and then later inoculated with the pathogen, S. subterranea, they exhibit overall reduction in disease. While pathogen reduction has been experimentally supported, further experimentation needs to be performed.. Genomic data inclusive a genome draft became recently available, that might hold information that can be used to improve disease management.

The ground, at North Marine Road, sees large crowds of holiday makers watching a mixture of first-class county cricket, one-day fixtures and invitation XIs in the late August/early September sunshine every year. Many of the world's greatest cricketers have played in festival matches over the years. There have been 399 first-class matches at Scarborough, the vast majority of these in the festival and as well as Yorkshire's games against county opposition ad hoc teams under the name of H. D. G. Leveson-Gower, Tom Pearce, Brian Close and Michael Parkinson have entertained touring teams and World XIs on many occasions. A one-day competition, under the names of various sponsors, was played in the seventies, eighties and nineties and featured four counties who would play a knockout semi final and final for the cup. Two of the greatest batsmen in history scored double hundreds during the festival. Jack Hobbs amassed an unbeaten 266 for the Players against the Gentlemen in 1925 while Sir Len Hutton hit 241 in the same fixture in 1953. The prolific Philip Mead of Hampshire scored two double tons, 233 for the MCC against Lord Hawke's XI in 1929 and 223 for the Players against the long suffering Gentlemen in 1911. The highest innings in festival history came when Ken Rutherford, the former New Zealand Test captain, smashed 317 in a day for the New Zealand tourists against D. B. Close's XI in 1986. The batsmen did not always have it their own way. The great Wilfred Rhodes pocketed 9 for 24 for CI Thornton's XI v. Australians in 1899 and J. M. Preston had taken 9 for 28 for Yorkshire against Marylebone Cricket Club 11 years before. Johnny Briggs took 9 for 31 for Lord Londesborough's XI v. the Australians in 1890 and Bill Bowes laboured hard to take 9 for 121 for Yorkshire against Essex in 1932. The ground, with its limited boundaries, hard outfield and excellent pitch, has seen many high scores during the festival. The Surrey dynamo Ali Brown thrashed 133 in company with Graham Thorpe (102*) to help Surrey to 375 for 4 in just 40 overs in a Sunday League match in 1994 while Yorkshire themselves clobbered Nottinghamshire for 352 in 45 overs in 2001 thanks to Darren Lehmann's incredible 191 which came off 103 balls in 115 minutes with 20 fours and 11 sixes. In first-class cricket Yorkshire declared on 600 for 4 against Worcestershire in 1995, thanks to David Byas's double century and an unbeaten ton from Craig White, while the North of England posted 590 against the South of England in 1906.

The history of York City F.C. from 1908 to 1980 covers the period from the club's original foundation, through their reformation and progress in the Football League, to the end of the 1979‚Äì80 season. Founded in 1908, York City played several seasons in the Northern League and Midland League before going into liquidation during the First World War. The club was reformed in 1922 and was elected to play in the Midland League for 1922‚Äì23. After seven seasons in the Midland League, they were elected to play in the Football League for 1929‚Äì30, and were placed in the Third Division North. During the Second World War, York played in regional competitions, before the Football League restored its usual competitions in 1946‚Äì47. After 14 seasons in the Football League, the club was required to apply for re-election for the first time because they finished 1949‚Äì50 at the bottom of the Third Division North. York had their best FA Cup season in 1954‚Äì55, when they reached the semi- final; they were defeated by First Division team Newcastle United in a replay. York played in the Third Division North until 1958‚Äì59, when a league reorganisation placed them in the Fourth Division. The same season, they finished third and won their first promotion, but were relegated after one season. York won another promotion in 1964‚Äì65, but were again relegated after one season. The club won a third promotion to the now-unified Third Division in 1970‚Äì71, remaining there for the next two seasons on goal average. They were promoted to the Second Division for the first and only time in 1973‚Äì74. By mid October 1974, York were in fifth place‚Äîtheir highest league placing‚Äîbefore finishing 1974‚Äì75 in 15th place. They faced two successive relegations in 1976 and 1977, and a 22nd-place finish in the 1977‚Äì78 Fourth Division forced the club to apply for re-election. 1908‚Äì17: Foundation and liquidation of original club Line-up of York personnel, pre-1912 With the expansion of the York & District League (formed 1897) at a time when association football was gaining in national popularity, demand for a club representative of the city of York arose. York City Football Club was founded as an amateur club, joining the Northern League for the 1908‚Äì09 season and acquiring a ground in Holgate Road at the end of Lindley Street and Murray Street. York won their first match 2‚Äì1 at home to South Bank, but finished the season 11th out of 12 teams in the Northern League. During this season, the club entered the FA Amateur Cup; after beating Withernsea and St Paul's, the team were knocked out by Scarborough in a replay. York finished in last place in 1909‚Äì10, before joining the Yorkshire Combination to reduce travelling. York competed in this division for two seasons; after finishing eighth in a 10-team league in 1910‚Äì11 they ranked in the same position in an expanded league of 14 teams the following season. J. E. Wright took over as secretary in 1911, and advocated the formation of a limited company to run a professional club, believing amateur football would not succeed in a rugby league stronghold. The club turned professional in 1912, and acquired a rough plot of land known as Field View. York were admitted to the Midland League in June 1912, and the new ground was opened with a 2‚Äì1 win over Rotherham Town, which was played before 5,000 spectators. They played in the Midland League for three seasons, achieving a highest finish of 10th of 20 teams in 1912‚Äì13, before ranking 12th in an 18-team league the following season. York were invited to a meeting to discuss the formation of a Third Division of the Football League, but with the outbreak of the First World War the meeting did not take place. Because of hostilities, the Midland League was suspended after 1914‚Äì15, in which York ranked 16th out of 20 teams. The club went into liquidation through the bankruptcy court in August 1917 after a creditor pressed for payment for the ground's stand. York's ground was taken over by the York Corporation, who leased it to allotment holders. 1922‚Äì39: Refoundation and establishment in Football League York played at Fulfordgate after the club's foundation in 1922. As local football continued to expand after the war, and with the success of the newly formed Yorkshire League, demand for another senior team in York arose. At a meeting held at the Co- operative Hall in York on 6 May 1922, the decision was made to form the York City Association Football and Athletic Club Limited, with W. H. Shaw as chairman. Despite having neither a ground nor players, an application was made for election to the Football League; this was unsuccessful, but the club was admitted to the Midland League on 10 June 1922. York's first match was away to Notts County reserves on 6 September 1922, and despite a good performance the team lost 4‚Äì2. York had to play their first two home matches at Mille Crux, the ground of Messrs Rowntree & Company Limited, because their Fulfordgate ground was not ready. Their first match at Fulfordgate came on 20 September 1922, with a 4‚Äì1 victory against Mansfield Town. York finished 1922‚Äì23 in 19th place; they had been placed midtable in early March 1923 but failed to win any of their remaining 14 fixtures. In the same year, York reached the final of the North Riding Senior Cup, but lost 4‚Äì2 to Middlesbrough reserves at Ayresome Park on 10 March 1923. The club's first season proved disappointing financially, with a loss of ¬£718 reported, and as a consequence Shaw relinquished the chairmanship to Arthur Brown. York entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1923‚Äì24 and reached the first qualifying round, losing 3‚Äì1 to Mexborough Town in a second replay. They again ranked 19th in the table with an almost identical record to the previous season's. For 1924‚Äì25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve teams from the competition. York finished sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925‚Äì26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926‚Äì27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds for the first time this season, being beaten 2‚Äì1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re- elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927‚Äì28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928‚Äì29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North. York moved to Bootham Crescent in 1932. York's first match in the Football League was against Wigan Borough at Springfield Park on 31 August 1929 and finished with a 2‚Äì0 victory for the visitors. Reg Stockill, the scorer of the first goal, became the youngest player to represent the club in a competitive match at the age of 15 years and 281 days. The 1929‚Äì30 season brought two meetings with First Division team Newcastle United in the FA Cup third round, and a sixth-place finish in York's debut Football League season. Collier resigned as manager in May 1930 and George Sherrington took over for the following three years, combining this with his role as club secretary. Sherrington's first season in charge saw York rank 12th in the league, and they again faced First Division opposition in the FA Cup third round, taking Sheffield United to a replay. Despite an improved league position of ninth in 1931‚Äì32, York were eliminated from the FA Cup in the first round. This, combined with disappointing average home crowds, resulted in a deficit of ¬£1,539 over the season. In August 1932, York moved to a new ground at Bootham Crescent, which was closer than Fulfordgate to the club's centre of support and the railway station. The ground was officially opened for a match with Stockport County on 31 August 1932; it ended a 2‚Äì2 draw, and the first goalscorer at the ground was Tom Mitchell. York's worst performance in the Football League to date came in 1932‚Äì33, finishing in 20th place. The club only avoided having to seek re- election after winning the last match of the season. Collier was re-appointed manager in May 1933, and York enjoyed a better season in 1933‚Äì34, finishing 12th in the Third Division North. The club finished in 15th place in 1934‚Äì35, and Bootham Crescent staged its first match against First Division opposition when Derby County defeated York 1‚Äì0 in the FA Cup third round. In 1935‚Äì36, York ranked in 16th place, and by the end of the season the club's debt was ¬£7,048. The annual report stated that \\"increased support must be forthcoming if the club was to retain its Football League status\\". The team reached the FA Cup fourth round for the first time in 1936‚Äì37, being eliminated by Second Division team Swansea Town in a replay. Collier retired from football in March 1937 to go into business with his brother, and was replaced by Tom Mitchell. The team finished an inconsistent season in 12th place. The 1937‚Äì38 season saw York placed \\"firmly on the football map\\", as the team eliminated First Division teams West Bromwich Albion and Middlesbrough from the FA Cup, before meeting Huddersfield Town in the sixth round. This match saw York draw 0‚Äì0 at home before a crowd of 28,123, the club's record highest attendance. York lost the replay 2‚Äì1 at Leeds Road, a match that attracted 58,066 spectators. By the end of that season's FA Cup run, York were on the fringe of the promotion race, but faltered in the closing weeks and finished in 11th place. The club avoided having to apply for re-election with a win in the penultimate match of 1938‚Äì39, ranking 20th in the table. W. H. Sessions was appointed chairman to succeed Brown in 1939. 1939‚Äì59: Wartime football, FA Cup run and first promotion York's league positions since 1929‚Äì30 At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Football League was suspended indefinitely, leaving the club with no revenue. The Football League organised regional competitions after the government gave the Football Association permission for football to proceed on a wartime footing. York decided to carry on playing and were placed in the North East League, where they ranked eighth in their section of 11 clubs. In the final weeks of 1939‚Äì40, York competed in the Football League War Cup. The club was placed in the Football League North for 1940‚Äì41, and finished 32nd in the 36-club league. They beat Sheffield Wednesday 7‚Äì0 in the War Cup, before being eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round. After completing 18 fixtures in the 1941‚Äì42 Football League North, York competed in the league-organised qualifying stage of the War Cup. They were eliminated after ranking 33rd of 54 clubs, failing to qualify for the knock-out stages by one place. York played in the Combined Counties Cup in the season's closing weeks, and beat Halifax Town 5‚Äì4 over two legs in the final. After ranking 17th of 48 clubs in the Football League North in 1942‚Äì43, York progressed through the War Cup qualifying stages, reaching the semi-final of a major cup competition for the first time. They were beaten 4‚Äì1 over two legs by Sheffield Wednesday. In the 1943‚Äì44 Football League North, the team finished 31st of 50 clubs, and after qualifying for the War Cup knock-out stages were eliminated 7‚Äì2 over two legs by Bradford Park Avenue in the second round. York experienced selection problems in 1944‚Äì45 with many players leaving for war service; after ranking 42nd of 54 clubs in the Football League North, they then failed to qualify for the War Cup knock-out stages. They extended their programme by competing in the Tyne, Wear and Tees Cup. Although hostilities had finished by the start of 1945‚Äì46, there was insufficient time for the Football League to restore its usual competitions. York finished midtable in the Third Division North (East) in the first half of the season, before reaching the second round of the Third Division North (East) Cup after qualifying through the group stages. The FA Cup resumed this season, and for the first and only time ties were played on a two-legged basis. York reached the fourth round, at which point they were beaten 11‚Äì1 on aggregate by Sheffield Wednesday. York made a profit in five of the seven seasons played during the war. Peacetime football resumed in 1946‚Äì47, with the same fixture list as the abandoned 1939‚Äì40 season. York endured a midseason run of 10 defeats from 11 matches, before their form improved, and five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish in 15th place in the Third Division North. They were top of the table by mid September 1947, before a run of two wins from 13 matches saw them drop to 18th place. York finished 1947‚Äì48 in 13th place, and the club recorded a net profit of ¬£4,914; a balance surplus of ¬£1,843 was carried forward. In September 1948, York purchased their Bootham Crescent ground, which had been leased since 1932, for ¬£4,075. They achieved their record average league attendance of 10,412 during 1948‚Äì49 at the peak of the post-war attendance boom. The team enjoyed a run of eight successive league wins at home spanning September 1948 to January 1949, but failed to win any of their last seven fixtures to finish 1948‚Äì49 in 14th place. Mitchell resigned as manager in February 1950 and was replaced in April with Dick Duckworth, a former York player. York were forced to apply for re-election to retain their place in the Football League for the first time, after finishing bottom of the Third Division North in 1949‚Äì50. They did not have to enter the ballot because the Football League was to be extended to 92 clubs for 1950‚Äì51. Despite York's senior team's troubles, the reserve team scored over 100 goals to finish sixth in the Midland League, and won the North Riding Senior Cup for the first time after beating Middlesbrough 3‚Äì0 at Ayresome Park in the final. York's fortunes improved in 1950‚Äì51; they ranked 17th in the league and reached the FA Cup third round for the first time since 1946, when they were beaten 2‚Äì0 by First Division team Bolton Wanderers at Burnden Park. York's best post-war season to date came in 1951‚Äì52, as they finished in 10th place and set a home record of 16 wins, four draws and three defeats. York chased promotion in 1952‚Äì53, and by late January 1953 they were third in the table. They finished in fourth place with 53 points; both new club records in the Football League. During this season, Duckworth was reluctantly released from his contract in October 1952 to take charge at Stockport County. His successor, the former Grimsby Town manager Charlie Spencer, died in February 1953. Sheffield United's assistant manager Jimmy McCormick was appointed in June 1953, and by late December York were bottom of the table. A win in the last match of 1953‚Äì54 meant they finished in 22nd place, and avoided having to apply for re-election. Sessions resigned as chairman in November 1953 and was succeeded by Hugh Kitchin. York's FA Cup semi-final replay with Newcastle United was played at Roker Park. After a dispute with the directors over team selection, McCormick resigned in September 1954, after which team affairs were handled by trainer Tom Lockie and secretary George Sherrington. With an emphasis on close-passing attacking football, the team embarked on a 10-match unbeaten sequence. In the 1954‚Äì55 FA Cup, York became the first third-tier club to participate in an FA Cup semi-final replay. York beat Scarborough, Dorchester Town, Blackpool (winners of the competition 18 months earlier), Bishop Auckland, Tottenham Hotspur and Notts County in the previous rounds before playing Newcastle United in the semi-final. After drawing 1‚Äì1 at Hillsborough, York were defeated 2‚Äì0 in the replay at Roker Park, which ended an FA Cup campaign in which Arthur Bottom scored eight goals. The team were billed \\"The Happy Wanderers\\" after a popular song; Henry Rose of the Daily Express said, \\"There are no weak spots in this First Division side masquerading in Third Division shirts\\". By the end of the cup run, York were on the fringes of the Third Division North promotion race, but injuries and a congested fixture list led to them finishing fourth in 1954‚Äì55. Bottom was the divisional top scorer that season, with 31 goals. York were optimistic for 1955‚Äì56, and they were top of the table after 10 matches. A run of nine consecutive matches without a win saw York drop out of promotion contention, and they finished 11th. That season's FA Cup run included a 2‚Äì1 win over a Swansea Town team featuring eight Wales internationals at Vetch Field in the third round. They then played First Division team Sunderland, billed as the \\"Bank of England club\\" because of their high expenditure on transfers, York were beaten 2‚Äì1 at Roker Park in a replay. During this season, York filled the managerial position that had been vacant for the last 18 months; Arsenal player Don Roper rejected the job before Sam Bartram was appointed in March 1956. Bartram, a former Charlton Athletic player, was a popular choice, having been a favourite with the fans while playing for the club during the war. York invested heavily in transfers for 1956‚Äì57, spending ¬£12,000 on fees‚Äîa sizeable amount at that time. The aim was promotion to the Second Division, but the team failed to make the intended impact and finished in seventh place. The 1957‚Äì58 season was the last of regionalised football; the top 12 clubs in the North and South sections would form the new Third Division, and the bottom clubs would become founder members of the Fourth Division. York went into the Easter period third from bottom, but after seven wins and three draws in their last 10 matches they missed out on a top-12 position on goal average. York led the Fourth Division until early November 1958, and despite faltering midseason continued strongly to finish third in 1958‚Äì59 and gain promotion for the first time. They only missed out on the runner-up spot to Coventry City on goal average. 1959‚Äì80: Promotions, relegations and spell in Second Division Club crest during the 1960s and 1970s By late February 1960, York were 12th in the Third Division. After one season, in which the team won only two of their last 14 matches, they were relegated from the Third Division in 21st place. Bartram was released from his contact in July 1960 and was replaced by Lockie. His team started 1960‚Äì61 well, and were fourth by mid November 1960. York endured five successive defeats before a winning run in the New Year revived their promotion hopes. They finished the season in fifth place, having won only one of their last seven matches. Throughout 1961‚Äì62, York were in or around the top four places, but missed out on promotion after losing 1‚Äì0 to Aldershot in the last match, finishing in sixth place. That season, York enjoyed their best run in the newly instituted League Cup. In this competition, they beat First Division team Leicester City, but were eliminated after a 2‚Äì1 defeat to divisional rivals Rochdale at Spotland Stadium in the fifth round. York made a poor start to 1962‚Äì63 and were second from bottom by late December 1962. Their form improved from March 1963 and they finished the season 14th. Club historian David Batters described the 1963‚Äì64 season as \\"one of the worst in the club's history\\". York spent most of the season in the bottom four before finishing 22nd, having to apply for re-election for the second time. This application was successful, as the club polled the maximum 48 votes. During this season, a football betting scandal exposed by the newspaper Sunday People accused York player Jack Fountain of fixing match results. His contract was terminated and he was found guilty of fixing two matches York lost. York produced some of their best football in a decade in 1964‚Äì65, winning 20 league matches at home‚Äîa club record‚Äîand ending the season in third place to gain promotion, one point behind champions Brighton & Hove Albion. The following season, they were in the bottom four by late December 1965. They finished the season in bottom place and were relegated back to the Fourth Division, having conceded a club-record 106 goals. After the season ended, York released Norman Wilkinson, who had scored a club-record 143 goals. York struggled throughout 1966‚Äì67 and finished 22nd after a club-record eight successive defeats. The club was forced into its third re-election bid, which was successful with 45 votes. Kitchin resigned the chairmanship in June 1967 and was succeeded by Derrick Blundy, who held the position for 16 months, after which Eric Magson took over. York started 1967‚Äì68 winning none of their first 13 matches. Their first win came in late October 1967, by which time Lockie had become the first manager to be dismissed by the club. Former Sheffield United player Joe Shaw took charge in November 1967, and York rose from bottom place to 14th by late March 1968. However, they won none of their last eight matches and finished 21st. Another application for re-election was made, which was successful with 46 votes. Shaw resigned for personal reasons a week into 1968‚Äì69, and former Huddersfield Town manager Tom Johnston succeeded him in October 1968. Poor away form led to York finishing 21st, and the club's application for re-election was successful with 45 votes. The team reached the FA Cup third round, and were beaten 2‚Äì0 at home by First Division team Stoke City. York were fourth in the table 12 matches into 1969‚Äì70. Their promotion challenge faded and they finished the season 13th. York reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time since 1958, and played two Second Division teams; after beating Cardiff City 3‚Äì1 at St Andrew's in a second replay, they lost 4‚Äì1 to Middlesbrough at Ayresome Park. Barry Jackson, who made a club-record 539 appearances for York, was released at the end of the season. York started 1970‚Äì71 strongly, and after faltering midseason they went unbeaten in 16 consecutive matches to enter the top four. Despite losing three of their last four fixtures, York remained in fourth place to earn a third promotion. They also reached the FA Cup fourth round for the second successive season; after drawing 3‚Äì3 at home to First Division team Southampton they were beaten 3‚Äì2 in the replay at the Dell. York started 1971‚Äì72 with three wins from eight matches, but after failing to win in 11 consecutive matches they dropped into the bottom four. They finished 19th on goal average and avoided relegation. In the third round of the League Cup, York played First Division team Sheffield United, losing 3‚Äì1 at Bramall Lane. York failed to win any of their first 11 matches in 1972‚Äì73, but results improved and they were 10th in the table by early March 1973. Another downturn in form followed before York beat Rotherham United in the last match of the season to finish 18th, avoiding relegation from the Third Division on goal average for the second successive year. York endured successive relegations from the Second Division to the Fourth Division under Wilf McGuinness. From mid November 1973, York remained within the top three in 1973‚Äì74, winning promotion to the Second Division for the first time, in the season \\"three up, three down\\" was introduced in the top three divisions. Promotion was secured after a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Oldham Athletic on 27 April 1974. This season, York held First Division team Manchester City to a 0‚Äì0 home draw in the League Cup fourth round, before being beaten 4‚Äì1 in the replay at Maine Road. In January 1974, Bob Strachan became chairman and served on the FA Council, the first York official to do so. The team drew 1‚Äì1 at home with Aston Villa in their opening Second Division match on 17 August 1974, with Barry Lyons the York goalscorer. After starting 1974‚Äì75 well, York were fifth in the table by mid October 1974‚Äîthe club's highest-ever placing in the Football League. York finished in 15th place, and the season's highlights included doubles over Norwich City‚Äîwho won promotion‚Äîand Fulham‚Äîwho were FA Cup finalists that season. York were exempt from the FA Cup until the third round, where they drew 1‚Äì1 with First Division team Arsenal at Highbury; in the replay, Arsenal won 3‚Äì1 after extra time at York. Johnston left to take over at Huddersfield Town in January 1975, and was succeeded in February by former Manchester United manager Wilf McGuinness.Dunk, ed. Rothmans Football Yearbook 1975‚Äì76. p. 30. York started 1975‚Äì76 with two wins from eight fixtures, but a run of 10 defeats from 11 matches saw them drop into the bottom two. Seven successive defeats in the New Year saw York drop to bottom place, although results improved in the season's closing weeks. They were relegated to the Third Division in 21st place, after a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Chelsea on 24 April 1976. They lost their League Cup second round match 1‚Äì0 at home to First Division team Liverpool. York started 1976‚Äì77 poorly, and they were in the bottom two of the Third Division for most of the first half of the season. The midseason signings Chris Galvin and Gordon Staniforth marked an improvement in results, but after winning only one of their last 15 matches they finished in bottom place and were relegated for the second successive season. The 1977‚Äì78 season also started poorly; York lost seven of their opening 12 matches, leaving them 17th in the table. McGuinness was dismissed in October 1977 and was succeeded the following month by Charlie Wright, a former Charlton Athletic player. York remained in the lower reaches of the table and finished the season in 22nd place, forcing the club to apply for re-election for the sixth time. This was successful, as the club polled the maximum number of votes. This season, attendances fell to an all-time low, and amid growing financial trouble, Michael Sinclair took over as chairman in April 1978 in a boardroom shuffle. Results improved in 1978‚Äì79; York finished 10th in the Fourth Division and reached the FA Cup fourth round. They played reigning First Division champions and European Cup winners-elect Nottingham Forest, and were beaten 3‚Äì1 at the City Ground. In 1979‚Äì80, York were consistently in the lower reaches of the table, before finishing 17th. With the club 18th in the table by mid March 1980, Wright was dismissed. Youth coach Barry Lyons succeeded him, initially as caretaker manager, before being appointed permanently in May 1980. References Category:York City F.C.

Biography Beno√Æt-Marie Lang√©nieux by William Ewart Lockhart. He studied humanities in Paris at St-Nicolas du Chardonnet, under F√©lix Dupanloup; and theology at St-Sulpice, where he was ordained, 1850. After nine years as curate at St-Roch, he became successively diocesan promoter 1859; cur√© of St- Ambroise, 1863; then of St-Augustin, 1868; Vicar-General of Paris, and archdeacon of Notre-Dame in 1871. Made Bishop of Tarbes in 1873, he was in the following year translated to the archiepiscopal See of Reims. The thirty-one years of his episcopate were fruitful ones. Beside obtaining from the French legislature an appropriation of two millions of francs for the restoration of Reims cathedral, he secured for the Trappists the ancient Abbey of Igny, and for the Oratorians the priory of Binson, and erected at Ch√¢tillon the colossal statue of Pope Urban II, whose cultus he had promoted in Rome. He built in the suburbs of his metropolis the churches of Ste-Genevi√®ve, St-Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, St-Benoit, and Ste-Clothilde, this latter being afterwards made the seat of an archconfraternity of prayer for France, and the place of celebration of the fourteenth centenary of Clovis's baptism. When the law of school secularization came into effect, he filled his see with Catholic schools and founded four asylums for orphans. Created cardinal in 1886, he presided as papal legate over the Eucharistic Congresses of Jerusalem, Reims, and Lourdes. He took an active part in the beatification of Joan of Arc. He fought the anti-religious legislation that was being prepared against Christian education, the religious institutes, and the concordat. His \\"D√©claration des Cardinaux et expos√© de la situation faite √† l'√âglise de France\\" (1892), and his \\"Lettre au Pr√©sident de la R√©publique\\" (1904), remain as witnesses to his character. He cherished above all the title of \\"Cardinal des ouvriers\\" given him by the gratitude of the working class, whose interests, spiritual and material, he never ceased to champion. Lang√©nieux enjoyed the friendship of Pope Leo XIII, who consulted him on all matters concerning the Church in France. The universal esteem in which he was held was abundantly proved by the many decorations which European rulers bestowed on him and by the vast concourse of bishops, priests, and people at his two jubilees and at his funeral. His eulogy was pronounced by Gaspard-Marie- Michel-Andr√© Latty, Bishop of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne, and Bishop Touchet, of Orl√©ans. Beside the pamphlets mentioned above and a number of occasional discourses, we have from Lang√©nieux's pen: eight pastoral letters (Tarbes, 1873); 231 mandements (Reims, 1874‚Äì1905); and \\"Abreg√© de l'Histoire de la Religion\\" (Paris, 1874). He participated in the conclave of 1903, which elected Pope Pius X.

Sate Celup or Satay Celup (Steamboat Satay) is a dish where an assortment of raw and semi-cooked seafood, meat (including raw meat) and vegetables on skewers are dunked into a hot boiling pot of satay gravy. Satay celup is popular in Malacca (historical city in Malaysia). Many tourists and locals consider satay celup a favourite because there are more than 80 types of seafood and vegetables to choose from and the sauces are thick and aromatic. Moreover, the food is always kept fresh in huge refrigerators or on shelves of cold storages in food courts. In Singapore, the dish is prepared by preparing a large pot of satay gravy and slathering it on individual skewers. Satay celup is sold at prices that start as low as 80 cents in Malacca where delicious food is easily obtainable at cheap prices. Barley drinks often accompany the meal due to its hot and spicy flavour, coconut water or Chinese herbs tea will be a good combination. Satay celup is sold in a self-service mode, and as soon as seats are picked by customers, food can be immediately taken using trays provided.

He got his nickname after his preferred method of dispatching a victim. Willie had killed dozens of rival gangsters during the 1920s and was considered an important figure in the \\"Black-Hand\\" gang. Background Little background information is known about Altieri, including his date of birth, background, or how he died although it is known that an attempted assassination by Pegleg Lonergan led to \\"Willie\\" jumping through a window, narrowly escaping death. He was described as standing 5 feet 7 inches, weighing 170 pounds, and having blond hair and blue eyes. Altieri's hands were described as \\"soft\\", like a woman's, and he would often be found using his knives to clean his fingernails. Altierri was known for preferring to dispatch his victims via the use of two knives, which he kept in leather scabbards around his waist. His passion was so great for these weapons that he would apparently even sleep with the knives still on his person. Altieri was used to kill his victims with the same modalities: a rape chocking, or a Colt's gunshot close-up to the head of the victim. Each time he threw away the corpse, burying it in the surroundings of New Jersey. Criminal career Mob boss Yale used Altieri on many occasions to commit murders. In 1919, Yale sent Altieri to silence an informer within the gang. Altieri stabbed the informer in the torso with both knives, then broke off blades in the victim's body. Altieri later presented the handles to Yale, who mounted them on a plaque and hung it up in his office. At one point, Altieri himself narrowly avoided being assassinated. The White Hand gang tried to kill Altieri because they suspected he was responsible for killing gang member Petey Behan. However, the White Hand hitmen accidentally killed Angelo Gibaldi, the father of Vincenzo Gibaldi. Vincenzo Gibaldi later became famous as a Capone gunman and a chief organizer of the Saint Valentine's Day massacre by another name, Jack \\"Machine Gun Jack\\" McGurn. In retaliation, Gibaldi with Frankie Yale's consent killed the three hitmen responsible and thus avenged his father's death. Yale murder On July 1, 1928, Yale was murdered on the streets of Brooklyn. His killing was reportedly due to a falling out with Chicago mob boss Al Capone, Yale's former underling. After Yale's murder, Altieri slipped into obscurity. Very little is known as to the whereabouts of Willie \\"Two-Knife\\" Altieri after the murder of Frankie Yale in 1928.

Provided, even before his ordination, with several royal abbeys, he rapidly rose to the coadjutorship of Langres, then to that of Reims and became titular of that see at the age of twenty-nine. His administration was marked by zeal and success along the lines of popular education, training of clerics, parochial organization, restoration of ecclesiastical discipline and extirpation of Protestantism from the Sedan district. The importance of his see together with the royal favour brought him to the front in the affairs of the Church in France. As secretary of the Petite Assembl√©e of 1681, he reported for the king and against the pope on all disputed points: the extension of the royal claim called r√©gale, the forcible placing of a Cistercian abbess over the Augustinian nuns of Charonne, and the expulsion of the canonically elected vicars capitular of Pamiers. The famous Gallican Assembly of 1682 was convened at his suggestion. Elected president with Harlay, he caused the bishops to endorse the royal policy of encroachment on church affairs, and even memorialized the pope with a view to make him accept the r√©gale. His comparative moderation in the matter of the four Gallican propositions was due to Bossuet, who remarked that \\"the glory of the r√©gale would only be obscured by those odious propositions.\\" As president of the Assembly (1700) which undertook to deal with Jansenism and Laxism already judged by the pope, Le Tellier was lenient with the Jansenists and severe with theologians of repute. The same holds true of the various controversies in which he took part: the Nouveau Testament de Mons, the theory of philosophical sin and Molinism. Le Tellier is remembered as a successful administrator, an orator of some merit, a promoter of letters, a protector of Saint John Baptist de la Salle, Mabillon, Ruinart, etc., and a bosom friend of Bossuet, whom he consecrated, and visited on his deathbed, and whom he induced to write the \\"Oraison fun√®bre de Michel Le Tellier.\\" His manuscripts, in sixty volumes, are at the Biblioth√®que Nationale of Paris, and his library of 50,000 volumes at the Biblioth√®que Sainte-Genevi√®ve. Le Tellier was also a manuscript collector (e.g. Minuscule 10, 11, 13, 284, and 467).

The division provides telecommunications services to several Asian countries. The division was formerly incorporated as Hutchison Telecommunications International Limited, known as Hutchison Telecom or HTIL in short. It was an offshore company in the Cayman Islands and a listed company in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. It operates GSM, 3G and 4G mobile telecommunications services in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam under brands 3, Hutch and Vietnamobile. Hutchison Telecommunications International was formerly a listed company with a primary listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (former stock code: 2332) and American Depositary Shares quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. In May 2010, Hutchison Telecom became a fully owned subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa Group and its shares were delisted. In 2009, Hutchison Telecom also spin off part of their assets as a separate listed company Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings, which including 3 Hong Kong and Hutchison Global Communications. History In 1999 and 2000, Hutchison Telecom sold its Orange and VoiceStream interests and re-invested the greater part of the proceeds to develop its global third-generation (3G) mobile broadband telecommunications business, based on the European UMTS (W-CDMA) 3G standard. In early 2007, Hutchison Telecom made headlines by selling its 67% interest in the Indian mobile phone network Hutch Essar to Vodafone for US$13.1 billion (of which $2 billion was debt). In December 2007, minority shareholder of Hutchison Telecommunications International (HTIL), Orascom Telecom, sold the 14.2% stake of HTIL, to HTIL's parent company Hutchison Whampoa, for HK$7.5 billion (approx. US$962 million). Orascom also reduced the stake from 19.3% to 16.3%, through a private placement of shares to the market in October 2007. In 2009, Hutchison sold its controlling stake in Orange Israel to Scailex Corporation. Thus it ended using the Orange brand for providing mobile services. In 2009, it spun off Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings (stock code: 215) to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. In 2010, the company was privatized. Current operations= 3 Indonesia  In July 2005, Hutchison Telecom acquired a 60% equity stake in PT Hutchison CP Telecommunications (\\"Hutchison CP Telecom\\" or \\"HCPT\\"; formerly known as PT Cyber Access Communications) from the Charoen Pokphand Group Indonesia. In 2006, HCPT announced that it retained Siemens to design, build and operate state-of-the-art 2G and 3G nationwide wireless networks. HCPT launched its commercial services on 30 March 2007 under the 3 brand. Indonesia is an extremely attractive wireless market with a sizable population and a relatively low mobile penetration rate. It is an excellent example of Hutchison Telecom's vision and strategy in achieving growth in emerging markets. At the end of September 2009, HCPT's customer base grew to approximately 7.3 million. Hutch Sri Lanka The company's Sri Lankan operation, commonly known as Hutch. CK Hutchison Holdings Limited owns 85% controlling stake of the company while the rest is held by Emirates Telecommunication Group Company PJSC. Initially it was called as \\"CallLink\\" and was the second mobile operator in Sri Lanka. Hutchison acquired its services in 1998 with the aim of being a nationwide operator in Sri Lanka. , Hutch has a network coverage of approximately 90% of the entire island. Hutch announced that they acquired Etisalat on November 30, 2018. Hutch Sri Lanka operates a GSM/EDGE supported network using 900 / 1800 MHz. In 2012 the company launched HSPA+ services using 2100 MHz. The company launched 4G via 1800 Mhz B3 from 2018 and 900 MHz B8 from 2019.  Vietnamobile  In July 2004, Hutchison Telecommunications (Vietnam) S.√† r.l. (\\"Hutchison Telecom Vietnam\\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom, entered into a business cooperation contract with Hanoi Telecom Joint Stock Company. In February 2005, Hutchison Telecom was granted an investment licence by the government for the project and in January 2007, launched CDMA service under the brand HT Mobile. While they offered a superior network, the market uptake was greatly hampered by the lack of affordable CDMA handsets, in particular, those with the Vietnamese language option, coupled with the trend of leading manufacturers to scale back handset development for this market. On 8 March 2008 they received government approval to convert from CDMA technology to GSM. After the successful conversion, it launched GSM services in April 2009 under the new brand \\"Vietnamobile\\". The brand surpassed the one million customer mark within six months of launch, mostly in the prepaid segment. Vietnamobile offers some of the highest growth potential in the region. Former operations=Hutchison India  Hutchison Essar Limited started operations under the brand name \\"Orange\\" in Mumbai. In other states it was marketed under \\"Hutch\\" brand. It was then changed to \\"Hutch\\" nationwide when they expanded rapidly to become the third largest mobile service provider in India and furthered its market share through the acquisition of BPL, Fascel, Command & Aircel Digilink. On March 31, 2007 Hutchison Essar Limited (in Hutch Essar) sold its 67.1% stake to Vodafone.  Hutchison Orange Israel  Even after selling the Orange plc to Mannesmann AG in February 1999, Hutchison continued to use Orange brand in Israel. Recently they have sold the controlling stake in this venture to Scailex Corporation. Thus it ends the story of Orange brand associated with Hutchison Telecom. Though Scailex Corp are still using this brand for their Operations.  Hutch Thailand  In 2000, Hutchison Telecom and CAT Telecom Public Company Limited (\\"CAT Telecom\\") entered into a joint venture by establishing Hutchison CAT Wireless MultiMedia Ltd. (\\"Hutchison CAT\\") to provide exclusive marketing services for CAT Telecom‚Äôs CDMA mobile telecommunications in 25 provinces located in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area and in central, east coast and west coast regions of Thailand. In 2003, Hutchison CAT launched marketing services for CAT Telecom‚Äôs CDMA mobile services under the brand Hutch, providing high speed voice and data wireless service to customers. In 2013 Hutch Thailand has ended its CDMA services.

It is constructed in two storeys of stuccoed brick with a graduated Westmorland slate roof. Early history Cantley Hall was probably a home from around the 7th or 8th century, owned by a Saxon called Tochi prior to the conquest of England by the Normans in 1066, after which it probably went to the Everingham's or Everingham Ancestors. By 1209 it was known as Kanteleia, and Cauntele in 1246. By 1280 it was in the possession of Robert de Everingham. By the late 15th century the name of Cantley had been established and remained, while the residents of the estate were the Smith family. Childers family In 1610, Hugh Childers the Mayor of Doncaster from 1604, added Cantley Lodge to the existing family's traditional home at Carr House, Warmsworth, Doncaster by buying the Cantley estate from the Stapleton family. In 1714 Leonard Childers of Cantley Lodge bred the famous stallion \\"Flying Childers\\", son of \\"Darley Arabian\\". \\"Flying Childers\\" was later sold to the Duke of Devonshire, was never beaten and is still regarded as one of the fastest horses ever raced. He later retired to Chatsworth House, Derbyshire although he mainly covered mares owned by the Duke, as he was too far away from the main breeding centre of Yorkshire. Leonard's successors after his death in 1748 were his daughter Mildred Childers, who had married William Walbanke, and then their son Childers, who probably moved from Carr House to Cantley later in the century and who added the surname Childers to his own on inheriting. Between 1785 and 1786, Childers Walbank Childers considerably remodelled Cantley Lodge into an impressive country mansion and created the shooting forest Black Carr Plantation.Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council  Enjoy Black Carr Plantation Colonel John Walbanke-Childers (died 1812), son of Childers Walbanke-Childers, sold Carr House and made further improvements to Cantley, renaming it Cantley Hall.

In this approach, words that don't contribute to the representation are void; they can only provide a figurative expression. Examples of phrases which lack a secondary reference are 'a black Monday' (unless it is used figuratively) and Bernard Bolzano's 'round quadrangle'. Alexius Meinong's Types of objects can be mentioned here, too. In the first case, one may have a representation of a Monday (or at least of something one calls a Monday), as well as of something black, but not of a 'black Monday', since these qualities don't combine ('Monday' being too abstract to be combined with a concrete quality such as a color). In the second case, there is an incongruity: a quadrangle can be represented, but not a round one; conversely, there can be a circle, but it can't be square. It may, therefore, be debated whether a representation is created here. Another example is presented by George Berkeley. He says: \\"[...] Does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle (which is yet none of the most abstract, comprehensive and difficult) for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle, neither equilateral, equicrural, nor scalenon, but all and none of these at once?\\" (A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, Introduction, section 13.) Berkeley is here criticizing John Locke, demonstrating that each representation is particular (i.e., individual). Whether there is a meaning or not depends on the individual person: it is possible that a sentence has a meaning according to A, whereas B can't discern any. This may, e.g., result from relevant knowledge which A possesses and B lacks, as in the case where one should decide the answer to the question 'Is 15 a prime number?' and A knows what a prime number is and B doesn't; the sentence then doesn't have a meaning for B.

Prendergast was the first Chief Justice to be appointed on the advice of a responsible New Zealand government, but is chiefly noted for his far-reaching decision in Wi Parata v The Bishop of Wellington in which he described the Treaty of Waitangi as \\"a simple nullity\\" Early life Prendergast was born in London, United Kingdom, on 10 December 1826. He was the youngest son of Michael Prendergast QC ( appointed QC 1850) and his wife, Caroline Dawe, the sister of artist George Dawe. Appointed a judge of the Sheriff's Court in London in 1856, his father was controversial but probably eccentric and outspoken rather than corrupt. Other children were Michael (born 1822; came to New Zealand), Philip (born 1824) and Caroline (born 1829, died ). He was educated at St Paul's School, London. He entered Caius College, Cambridge in 1845, but soon migrated to Queens' College, graduating BA in 1849. In 1849, he married Mary Jane Hall at Cambridge. They had no children. He enrolled at the Middle Temple in London in 1849, but spent some of the following year teaching at Routledge's School, Bishop's Hull, Somersetshire. In 1852, he joined the rush to the Eureka diggings in Victoria, Australia. He had some luck as a goldminer but contracted dysentery and moved back to town where he became a magistrate's clerk, first at Elephant Bridge, then Carisbrook and, in 1854, Maryborough. In 1856, another Londoner, the young Julius Vogel, set up shop next to Prendergast's office on the Dunolly field, near Maryborough. Vogel and Prendergast began what was to be a long and mutually beneficial association. His brother Michael Prendergast was also in Victoria, and moved to Dunedin. Prendergast decided to emigrate to New Zealand and with his wife arrived in Dunedin on 20 November 1862. He was admitted to the Bar in Otago that year. His arrival in Dunedin coincided with the Otago goldrush. Thirty-three lawyers were enrolled in Dunedin in 1862, and twenty more over the next three years. Prendergast's first client was Julius Vogel, then editor of the Otago Daily Times. In Dunedin, Prendergast prospered ‚Äì he became a senior partner in the firm of Prendergast, Kenyon and Maddock. In 1863, he was appointed acting solicitor for the Otago Province, and in 1865 became Crown Solicitor in Otago. National roles From 1865 onwards Prendergast rose through series of national roles, from Member of Parliament, to Attorney-General and then Chief Justice of New Zealand and leading to his being knighted in November 1881. Legislative Council Prendergast, John Parkin Taylor, Arthur Seymour, John Acland, James Crowe Richmond, James Rolland, Henry Miller, Henry Joseph Coote and Alfred Rowland Chetham-Strode were all appointed to the Legislative Council on 8 July 1865. Prendergast resigned from that role on 15 March 1867. Attorney-General On 20 October 1865, he became a non-political Attorney-General of New Zealand for Edward Stafford's government. In 1867 he resigned from the Legislative Council, his role as Crown solicitor in Otago and his law practice and moved north to Wellington. As Attorney-General Prendergast's task was to consolidate the criminal law. In the process he drafted 94 Acts. He also helped to create order in the legal profession ‚Äì in 1870, the New Zealand Law Society was formed with Prendergast as its first president. Chief Justice of New Zealand Prendergast was appointed Chief Justice of New Zealand on 1 April 1875 on the advice of Sir Julius Vogels government. As such, he was the first New Zealand appointed Chief Justice. =Wi Parata v Bishop of Wellington= Prendergast's most notable judgement was Wi Parata v the Bishop of Wellington in 1877, a case involving Maori land in Porirua that was given to the Anglican Church for the purpose of building a school. The school was never built and Parata asked the land given to the Church be returned to the Ngati Toa iwi. In his judgement, Prendergast took the view that \\"native\\" or \\"aboriginal\\" customary title, not pursuant to a Crown grant, could not be recognised or enforced by the courts, because the Treaty of Waitangi was a \\"simple nullity\\". He called Maori \\"primitive barbarians\\", and said they were \\"incapable of performing the duties, and therefore of assuming the rights, of a civilised community\\". Prendergast's reasoning was both overturned and enhanced in 1941 when Te Heuheu Tukino v Aotea District Maori Land Board'Hoani Te Heuheu Tukino VI', URL: http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/hoani-te-heuheu-tukino-vi, (Ministry for Culture and Heritage), updated 8-Jun-2009 was decided, where the Court ruled that the Treaty was seen as valid in terms of the transfer of sovereignty, but as it was not part of New Zealand statute law it was not binding on the Crown. = The Barton Affair = During the \\"Barton Affair\\" of 1876-78 he imprisoned lawyer George Elliott Barton for a month for contempt of court, a ruling that split the Wellington legal profession. He had probably met \\"little Barton\\" (who was described as an \\"exciteable Irishman\\") on the Victorian goldfields. =Attack on Parihaka= A number of times, in his capacity as Chief Justice, he acted as Administrator of the Government. One controversial occasion was in 1881, when the Governor of New Zealand Sir Arthur Gordon was on a visit to Fiji, he sanctioned the invasion of the Maori pacifist Te Whiti o Rongomai's village at Parihaka‚Äîsomething the Governor had indicated he was opposed to. Retirement Prendergast resigned as Chief Justice on 25 May 1899, after his wife died on 5 March. In his retirement, he became a director of the Wellington Trust, Loan and Investment Company Limited, and the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited. In 1901 he planted the Sitka Spruce on Campbell Island, which in February 2017 was recorded to have the 'golden spike' in nuclear testing in the 1950s and 1960s; it has been named as the 'World's loneliest tree'.'Lonely juvenile tree with clear radioactive trace in its wood bears sign of new geological age' URL: http://www.ibtimes.co.in/lonely-juvenile-tree-clear-radioactive-trace-its- wood-bears-sign-new-geological-age-761528, updated 22-Feb-2018 He was also appointed a director of the Bank of New Zealand in March 1902. He was genuinely interested in farming matters and became the first president of the Manawatu and West Coast Agricultural and Pastoral Association. In 1912, Prendergast was granted the use of the title of \\"Honourable\\". Prendergast died in Wellington on 27 February 1921.

Creating a channel between the pay zone and the wellbore to cause oil and gas to flow to the wellbore easily. In cased hole completions, the well will be drilled down past the section of the formation desired for production and will have casing or a liner run in separating the formation from the well bore. The final stage of the completion will involve running in perforating guns, a string of shaped charges, down to the desired depth and firing them to perforate the casing or liner. A typical perforating gun can carry many dozens of explosive charges. Commonly, perforation guns are run on E-line as it is traditional to use electrical signals from the surface to fire the guns. In more highly deviated wells, coiled tubing may be used. Newer technologies allow the guns to be run on slickline. Modern slickline technology embeds fiber optic lines that can transmit two-way data on real-time temperature, pressure and seismic responses along the length of the slickline. This information allows very precise operations of various down-hole tools, including perforation guns. The benefit of this strategy is greater control of the well. Casing the bottom of the hole allows the well to be completed without having to worry about reservoir fluids. It also allows precise selection of where in the formation production will be and to be able to seal off perforations, which are no longer useful or counterproductive, through cementing or straddling. The disadvantage is that perforating can lead to \\"skin damage\\", where debris from the perforations can hinder productivity of the well. In order to mitigate this, perforating is commonly done underbalanced (lower pressure in the well bore than in the formation) as the lower well bore pressure will cause a surge of fluids into the well at the point of perforating, hopefully carrying the debris with it. Other methods of stimulation such as acidising and proppant fracturing are often required to overcome this damage and bring the well up to its full potential. Casing and perforating as a method of completion is common place nowadays, though in some unconsolidated formations prone to production of sand (BP Harding as an example), open hole completions using only sandscreens may be the preferred choice. Oil Well Perforation may be basically classified in two types a) Overbalanced Perforating and b) Underbalanced Perforating. Overbalanced perforating is normally carried out with the help of Perforating Guns or Hollow carriers. In Overbalanced Perforation the weight of the Well- bore Column is more than the Reservoir Pressure, thus it normally ensures that the Well does not start flowing oil or gas immediately after perforation. However, it may have the effect of damaging the formation due to forced entry of well-bore fluid (mud) into the reservoir.

The story follows Lillet Blan, a trainee witch who is sent into a repeating cycle of five days after her school is attacked by an evil wizard seeking the hidden Philosopher's Stone. The player commands units called familiars, each having strengths and weaknesses against the other, with the goal of either destroying the opponent's bases or surviving waves of enemies. GrimGrimoire was born from Vanillaware staff wanting to create their version of StarCraft, beginning development after completion of their first title Odin Sphere. Due to various factors, GrimGrimoire released before Odin Sphere, becoming the company's international debut while also draining its funds. Writer and director George Kamitani based the setting on Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg and the Harry Potter series. The music was composed by a team from Basiscape led by company founder Hitoshi Sakimoto. Upon release, the game met a generally positive reception; praise went to its narrative and implementation of RTS gameplay on a console, but many faulted the audio and controls. Despite Kamitani planning sequels, GrimGrimoire was a commercial failure and Nippon Ichi Software did not continue the series. The character Lujie Piche crossed over into Nippon Ichi Software's Soul Nomad & the World Eaters as part of the two company's collaboration. Vanillaware would later reimagine their early gameplay and presentation ideas for GrimGrimoire in 2019's 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. Gameplay A battle in GrimGrimoire, showing types of Glamour familiars. GrimGrimoire is a two-dimensional (2D) side-scrolling real-time strategy (RTS) video game; players take the role of trainee witch Lillet Blan, who completes both story missions and optional challenge levels. Each main level is bookended by story cutscenes, with the scenario taking place over a repeating five-day period. During the RTS segments, the player takes the role of Lillet Blan, who directs the action while the multi-floored battle area is shown from a side-scrolling perspective. All actions take place in real time, though gameplay can be paused for the player to issue commands. The environment and enemy movements beyond where the player has explored are obscured by a fog of war. There are three difficulty settings: \\"Sweet\\", \\"Easy\\" and \\"Normal\\". The player fights using units called Familiars. The units are split into four different styles representing the in-game magical schools. The schools are Glamour, Alchemy, Necromancy and Sorcery, which are unlocked at different points during the story. Each school has a rock-paper-scissors arrangement of strengths and weaknesses among the schools, summoning different associated familiars. The units have different movement abilities, tied to both their group and their movement style. Units in battle areas are split between the player, allied allied characters or the level's enemy force. There are six commands available: Move, Attack, Defend, Heal, Patrol and Gather. Units are summoned from runes conjured by magical books called Grimoires. Runes can established on each floor of the level, with each three of the twelve available runes aligned to a different form of magic. Establishing runes and summoning Familiars require Mana, magical energy gathered from crystals on some floors using units from the Glamour class. Grimoires can be levelled up, granting access to new and more powerful units. Levels have different win conditions, though many are won by destroying all enemy runes. Synopsis=Setting and characters The action of GrimGrimoire takes place entirely within the Tower of Silver Star, a magic school with ancient roots, over a repeating cycle of five days. In the game's backstory, the Archmage Calvaros cooperated with fellow wizards Gammel Dore and Lujie Piche to create the Philosopher's Stone, a powerful magical object. Calvaros attempted to use its power for himself, and was killed by Gammel and Lujie; Lujie in turn attempted to use it, and after being killed becomes a hostile ghost within the Tower. The main protagonist is Lillet Blan, a talented witch-in-training from a rural area. She is taught by Gammel; the demon Advocat; the half-lion alchemist Chartruese; and the necromancer Opalnaria. Lillet's fellow students are the casual and flirtatious Bartido; the upright Hiram; and Margarita, who hails from an area that hunts witches. She also grows close to Amoretta, a homunculus created by Chartruese from an angel's soul. Plot Lillet Blan arrives at the Tower of Silver Star to begin her schooling. During her first five days, she meets her teachers and fellow students. On her fifth evening, Lillet wakes to find the Tower under attack from Calvaros's released spirit, who has killed the other teachers and is seeking the Philosopher's Stone. Before he can kill her, the clock strikes midnight and she is sent back to the beginning of her first day at the Tower. During the next three loops of time, Lillet learns more about the Tower's inhabitants and her own situation. Calvaros's power came from a contract with the demon Grimlet, with Grimlet being imprisoned when Calvaros was defeated. The ghost of Lujie is both fuelling Opalnaria's obsession with Chartruese‚Äîwho was cursed when he refused Lujie's advances‚Äîand instructing her in a ritual to destroy Grimlet that will fail due to being incomplete. Bartido is a spy from another country sent to find the Philosopher's Stone. Margarita is revealed to be a spy for Calvaros's followers, sent to free him. Amoretta possessing an angel's soul means she can destroy Grimlet by sacrificing herself; in two of the loops, she lets this happen. Lillet also learns the mechanics of demon contracts, including the fact that if a human's wish is refused the demon is trapped in Hell. She gains the powerful Lemegaton grimoire from Advocat using a contract, which is nullified by the next time loop. On the fifth loop, Lillet has Lujei prevent Opalnaria using the incomplete ritual; gives shelter to Amoretta to prevent her from dying; helps settle the feud between Opalnaria and Chartruese, which indirectly leads to a romance between Opalnaria and Hiram; and frees Margarita from Calvaros's power. Summoning Grimlet with the Lemegaton so he can devour Calvaros, she then makes a contract with him and wishes that he embrace God; refusing the wish, Grimlet is banished to Hell. Discovering the Philosopher's Stone under her room, she finds an older version of herself. It turns out Lillet has already gone through the cycle of time loops thousands of times, with a version of Lillet remaining near the Stone to ensure the loop remains stable. Lillet breaks the loop by destroying the Philosopher's Stone, causing her older self to vanish. Lillet graduates and becomes Mage Consul to the country's capital, Bartido and Margarita leave the Tower, and Amoretta lives with Lillet. Visiting the Tower years later in her role as Mage Consul, Lillet meets remaining residents again, and learns that Lujie vanished into another world. Development Vanillaware was established by George Kamitani along with a small group to develop Odin Sphere, a successor to Kamitani's 1996 video game Princess Crown. While development on Odin Sphere was ongoing, Nippon Ichi Software heard that the Princess Crown team had formed their own studio. Interested in working with them, the then-president of Nippon Ichi Software, Sohei Shinkawa, contacted Vanillaware. Shinkawa later said he \\"fell in love\\" with Kamitani's artwork, prompting the initial inquiries. This was part of a transition within Nippon Ichi Software of being willing to work with external studios while acting as publisher, as their earlier policy had focused exclusively on in-house development. In a press release, the game was described as a co-production between Vanillaware and Nippon Ichi Software. While GrimGrimoire was the second Vanillaware project after Odin Sphere, it was the first to release due to being completed in a shorter timespan, ultimately securing a release date a month before the scheduled release of Odin Sphere by Atlus. According to differing estimates by Kamitani, the project took between six months and a year to complete, a schedule attributed to deadlines set by Nippon Ichi Software. The production of GrimGrimoire combined with the delayed release of Odin Sphere left Vanillaware drained of funds, forcing Kamitani to take out a flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat. Shinkawa wanted to collaborate on a game, and gave Vanillaware complete creative freedom. Due to this, the team did not restrain themselves and designed the game without considering its long-term commercial viability. Kamitani and many Vanillaware staff were fans and avid players of the real-time strategy game StarCraft. Due to this shared passion, they decided to create a fantasy-themed side-scrolling RTS. Kamitani later said his state of excitement over the project led to many of the decisions abound the story, deriving thematic cues from the universes of Atelier Marie: The Alchemist of Salburg and the Harry Potter series. Time and budget constraints lead to the number of characters being kept very low, and as a result a repeating timeloop was incorporated into the story. Due to the staff's familiarity with StarCraft, the gameplay was designed very quickly, but as Japanese gamers were not used to the RTS genre, they had to lower the difficulty and make the game user-friendly to genre newcomers. The original plan for explorable adventure game segments instead of the final cutscene- based narrative was cut due to time constraints. The initial character concepts were created by Kamitani; the character designs were handled by Kouichi Maenou, whose previous notable work was Sakurazaka Shouboutai published by Irem. Maenou worked a long time on Lillet Blan's designs, with it going through five separate drafts before the final version was approved. Like Odin Sphere, Vanillaware used 2D rather than 3D graphics that were dominating the game industry: Kamitani wanted GrimGrimoire and Odin Sphere to be the new leading edge for 2D art design. As with his games since Princess Crown, in- game character models were 2D artwork animated using \\"multi-jointing\\", a technique later associated with Adobe Flash animation. The scale and quality of the designs was severely limited by time constraints. Kamitani said that the character animations and the \\"fish bowl\\" perspective of cutscenes turned out better than expected in the final product. A notable part of the collaboration between Vanillaware and Nippon Ichi Software was the character Lujie Piche, who also appeared in Soul Nomad & the World Eaters. Lujie was originally designed for GrimGrimoire, but Nippon Ichi Software thought the character would be a good fit with the visuals and style of Soul Nomad. Music The music was composed by a team at Basiscape, a music and sound studio founded by Hitoshi Sakimoto. Sakimoto composed the score for GrimGrimoire alongside Masaharu Iwata, Kimihiro Abe, Mitsuhiro Kaneda and Noriyuki Kamikura. Sakimoto also created the main theme, and all the composers helped with arrangements. During his earliest work, Sakimoto had trouble understanding Kamitani's intentions for the game, so went with a small number of instruments and a feeling of homeliness. Later when he saw the game late in development, Sakimoto changed to include more instruments. The score also featured contributions from Hiroaki Yura and his Eminence Symphony Orchestra. An eighteen-track album for the game was released as a pre-order bonus in Japan. In North America, the soundtrack released both as part of the Silver Star Special edition and as a standalone release. The original prints of both versions suffered problems; the track list was incorrectly printed in Japan and corrected through an online list, while the North American version had the tracks in a file format unplayable by standard CD players which was corrected following release. The album has garnered mixed to positive reviews. Release GrimGrimoire was originally announced in November 2006, releasing on April 12, 2007. Pre-orders of the game came with a booklet of illustrations created by Kamitani and Maenou. A strategy guide was released on June 12, featuring breakdowns of levels and concept art of the characters and setting. The game was localised by NIS America, with voice recording handled by PSB Productions, which had already handled titles in Nippon Ichi Software's Disgaea series. It was NIS America's first release in the RTS genre. It released in North America on June 26, coming in a standard edition and a limited \\"Silver Star Special\\" edition which came with a soundtrack CD and downloadable strategy guide. In Europe, GrimGrimoire was published by Koei on September 28. Its release in the region was timed to be soon after the final Harry Potter book The Deathly Hallows. GrimGrimoire later released on the PlayStation Network (PlayStation 3) as a Classic title; it was published in 2011 in North America and 2014 in Japan. Reception In Japan, GrimGrimoire debuted in second place during its week of release behind Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, selling over 17,000 units. By the end of the year, it had sold over 26,600 units. Ultimately, GrimGrimoire was a commercial disappointment. GrimGrimoire was well received by the gaming press. It received an average rating of 78% on GameRankings based on 41 critic reviews. On Metacritic, the game garnered a score of 79/100 based on 39 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The reviewers for Famitsu gave a lot of praise to the game's aesthetics and style, but one writer found the gameplay too challenging at times. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer was generally positive, calling it one of the most innovative Japanese games of the year. GameSpots Kevin VanOrd called GrimGrimoire \\"a fun and terrific gem waiting to be discovered\\". Adam Biesenner, writing for Game Informer, struggled to recommend it due to issues with its controls and gameplay despite enjoying the deeper experience; this opinion was backed up by fellow writer Joe Juba. Greg Miller of IGN enjoyed his time playing it, but due to its mechanical faults could not rate the game any higher than he did in the review. PALGNs Tristan Kalogeropoulos described the game as just short of being a great title due to its mechanical issues. Edge enjoyed the title but found the repetitive elements brought the quality down over time. Greg Sewart of 1UP.com said the game felt \\"too watered-down and too repetitive\\" compared to other titles from Nippon Ichi Software. GamePro found the title generally inferior to the other console RTS titles available at the time despite compelling gameplay elements. The story divided opinion; many praised its style and writing, while others found fault in those same elements or called it overly derivative. The graphics earned high praise despite a lack of variety in battle arenas, while the music and voice acting met with a mixed reaction. There was praise on its implementation of RTS elements on consoles despite the limited scope; common complaints arose from rough controls and a lack of meaningful progress. Legacy Kamitani stated that GrimGrimoire was the only project he ever designed with the intent of creating a sequel, and despite wishes to do so, Nippon Ichi Software did not put in any requests. Based on this, Kamitani has since made sure to write stories that would stand on their own. Vanillaware later returned to their concept plans for GrimGrimoire when developing the 2019 science fiction-themed game 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim.

The FK 96 n.A. was shorter-ranged, but lighter than the French Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 or the British Ordnance QF 18 pounder gun; the Germans placed a premium on mobility, which served them well during the early stages of World War I. However, once the front had become static, the greater rate of fire of the French gun and the heavier shells fired by the British gun put the Germans at a disadvantage. The Germans remedied this by developing the longer-ranged, but heavier 7.7 cm FK 16. As with most guns of its era, the FK 96 n.A. had seats for two crewmen mounted on its splinter shield.

The nature of the Phoenix breakwaters meant they were constructed and sunk until needed (so as to be invisible to air attack); by design they would have had the water evacuated by Royal Engineers and then been towed to France where they would have become part of the harbour. There is a P.L.U.T.O. or Pipe Line Under The Ocean, station, formerly used to carry petrol across to France during the D-Day landings.

Littlestone Golf Club The textile entrepreneur Henry Tubbs established Littlestone Golf Club in 1888 on land bought with J Lewis. He built a house next to the course in 1889 to act as a Clubhouse until the current one was finished in 1910. This house, which seems to appear as St Andrew's Villa in the census of 1901, was known then and now as Netherstone. The minutes of the newly formed club committee note that Henry Tubbs as a committed Methodist did not allow alcohol in Netherstone. His nephew points out that this may be contributing to the slow growth in the popularity of the club. Netherstone is still a home, being the only house to have a balcony facing the links rather than the sea. A similar pattern on a grander scale was seen in Finchley, north London, where Henry Tubbs built Nether Court in 1883. This was ultimately to become the clubhouse of Finchley Golf Club in 1929 after his death, and is still in use as such today.

Most surviving examples in German service were rebarreled after the war as the 7.5 cm FK 16 nA (neuer Art, meaning \\"new model\\"). A total of 298 guns of the old type were still in German army service in 1939, making it the oldest field artillery piece in German inventory at the beginning of the Second World War. History The older 7.7 cm FK 96 n.A. field gun was very mobile, but, once the war settled into trench warfare, its lack of range became a serious disadvantage. The FK 16 was intended to remedy this problem. The barrel was lengthened and it was given a box carriage to allow for greater elevation, which increased the range. It was also given separate-loading ammunition to reduce powder consumption and barrel wear at short ranges, although this had the drawback of reducing the rate of fire compared to the older gun. It was prematurely rushed into production in 1916 and early guns suffered from a number of defects, mainly stemming from the German use of substitute materials to reduce consumption of strategic metals. It also suffered from a large number of premature detonations of its shells during 1916. These were traced to poor quality control of its shells, which were sometimes too large in diameter, and problems with the picric acid used as high explosive filler in lieu of TNT. The picric acid would form very sensitive picric salts within days of filling the shells and would often detonate from the shock of firing. Lacquering the insides of the shells and spraying them with a turpentine/starch solution neutralized the picric acid and prevented it from forming picric salts. The barrel of this gun was mounted on the carriage of the 10.5 cm Feldhaubitze 98/09 as the 7.7 cm Kanone in Haubitzelafette (i.e. \\"cannon on howitzer carriage\\") to allow it greater elevation and range. Belgium modified the guns it received as post-war reparations as the Canon de 75 mle GP II and the Canon de 75 mle GP III. After the war, some guns were retained by Germany, re-barreled into 75mm caliber, and used in World War II as the 7.5 cm FK 16 nA.  References Publications * Hogg, Ian. Twentieth-Century Artillery.

He is best known for his biography of Serbian despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, which George Ostrogorsky described as \\"the most important historical work of old Serbian literature\\",Ostrogorsky, History of the Byzantine State, translated by Joan Hussey, revised edition, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1969), p. 471 and for writing the first Serbian philological study, Skazanije o pismenah (A History on the Letters). He followed the writing style of the Old Serbian vita, first made popular in the Serbian scriptoria of the 12th century.  Biography  Constantine was born in Bulgaria, probably in the town of Kostenets. In his youth, he attended school in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria, and was taught by Andronik, a pupil of Patriarch Evtimiy of Bulgaria. He continued his studies on Mount Athos and in Constantinople. The Ottoman conquest of Tarnovo in 1393 drove him away and he settled in Stefan Lazareviƒá's Serbian Despotate, probably around 1402. He was warmly welcomed by the Despot, also a man of letters and a benefactor of education, and was given the position of educator at his palace in Belgrade. Constantine also frequented the Manasija monastery, where he helped establish the Serbian \\"Resava School\\" of literature. His high education, life experience and traveling earned him the nickname of \\"Filozof\\" (Philosopher), after Saint Cyril the Philosopher. On top of the travels in his youth, he traveled to the Holy Land and, judging by his description of three missions to the palaces of eastern rulers (Timur, Musa and Mehmed I), he may also have participated. After the Despot's death in 1427, Constantine left Belgrade and entered into the service of kesar Uglje≈°a Vlatkoviƒá, in the area of Vranje, where he later died. Constantine's work had a tremendous impact on medieval Serbian literature and education. He introduced many classical Greek elements of literature and philosophy. His frequent citing of ancient philosophers and comparisons of the Despot in the Biography caused many to consider him a precursor to the Renaissance which, due to the Ottoman conquest, never occurred in Serbian culture.  Biography of Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá  After Despot Stefan's death in 1427, Nikon I, Serbian Patriarch ordered Constantine to write the Despot's biography. That order was only fulfilled four years later, after Stefan himself allegedly appeared in Constantine's dream and restated Nikon's order. The biography is one of the most interesting in the old Serbian literature because it contains not only facts about the Despot's life, but also geographic information and thorough descriptions of numerous historical events. He was apparently inspired by the imperial chronicles of Byzantine historians. The Biography of Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá (–ñ–∏—Ç–∏—ò–∞ –¥–µ—Å–ø–æ—Ç–∞ –°—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–Ω–∞ –õ–∞–∑–∞—Ä–µ–≤–∏—õ–∞) begins with a geographic description of Serbia's natural beauties, going on to describe its residents, praising their character but also mourning their forthcoming fall to the Turks. An exhaustive story of court events and the Despot's life follows, with numerous Biblical and classical references and numerous historical data which have proven invaluable to later historians. On several occasions, Constantine used acrostics, with three masterpiece instances: in the introduction verses, in the titles of central chapters, and in the verses telling of his sorrow for the deceased Despot. Legacy Constantine of Kostenets, Pachomius the Serb, Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev, and Gregory Tsamblak were able to continue their literary activities virtually unhampered by any linguistic barrier when moving from the Balkans to Imperial Russia, no different than the role of Latin literature in the Roman Catholic part of medieval Europe. Constantine spoke and wrote a language which could not be identified with either the Bulgarian or Serbian vernaculars. Therefore, it was only natural for medieval Serbian biographers to turn for models to the body of existing vitae written in either Slavonic-Serbian or Church Slavonic language.

The role of an assistant can include holding the props that are used by a magician, shifting props onto and off the stage, and serving as a living prop in illusions that involve manipulation of the human body. Other aspects of the role can include dancing or acting as visual ornamentation, sometimes for simple aesthetic purposes and sometimes to misdirect audience attention. The figure of the glamorous female assistant has become a stereotype or icon in art, popular media and fiction. Although magicians' assistants appear to play a supporting role and receive a lesser billing than the magician who appears to be the source of illusions, the assistant is often the one making the mechanics of the illusions work. In the words of Joanie Spina, who worked for 11 years as principal assistant, choreographer and artistic consultant to illusionist David Copperfield: > ...I did find fault with the term \\"assistant\\" because it sounds like someone > rolling props on and off stage when many of us were highly trained actors > and dancers. History and critiques Sabrina and Vanessa with illusionist Christian Farla Assistants have been part of magic shows for most of the recorded history of magic as a performance art. Despite their often crucial role in magic acts they, and the work they do, have suffered from negative public perceptions. The assistant's role has often been stereotyped as consisting of menial tasks and having the primary purpose of adding a visually aesthetic element to an act. This is associated with the perception that assistants are usually female and often dressed in revealing costumes. Although there have been plenty of instances of male assistants throughout the history of magic, the glamorous female stereotype has made a particular impact because female assistants were a prominent feature of illusion shows during the 20th century, when magic began to reach huge new audiences, first through the burgeoning of live vaudeville and variety shows and then through television. The glamorous female assistant has become an iconic image that continues in modern media and literature. A notable feature of the glamorous female assistant iconography is the frequency with which assistants play the role of \\"victim\\" in illusions where they are tied up, apparently cut with blades, penetrated with spikes or swords or otherwise tortured or imperilled. Examples include Aztec Lady, Devil's Torture Chamber, Mismade Girl, Radium Girl, Zig Zag Girl, and, perhaps most famous of all, Sawing a woman in half.The topic of assistants portrayed as victims in violent illusions was featured in \\"Violent magic\\" the final episode of the six-part BBC television documentary series Magic in 2004, see Noted illusion designer and historian Jim Steinmeyer has identified the advent of the sawing illusion as a turning point in magic history and a moment which, more than any other, marks the origin of the cliche of the female assistant as victim. It is generally agreed that a \\"sawing\\" type illusion was first performed publicly by P. T. Selbit in January 1921. His presentations of what he titled \\"Sawing through a woman\\" made an enormous impact and greatly affected public expectations of stage magic for decades afterwards. Steinmeyer has explained: > Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased > and tortured by magicians. Since the days of Robert-Houdin, both men and > women were used as the subjects for magic illusions. Victorian gowns often > made it unrealistic for a lady to take part in an illusion or be pressed > into a tight space. Magician Dorothy Dietrich sawing celebrity assistant and comedian Robert Klein in half on TV One female magician Dorothy Dietrich has turned the tables and used men as assistants, sawing them in half. Changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of \\"victim\\" both practical and popular. Steinmeyer notes: \\"During the 1900s, as a shapely leg became not only acceptable on the stage but admired, it was fashionable to perform magic with a cast of attractive ladies\\". That was only part of the story, however. The trauma of war had helped to desensitize the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were also tiring of the gentler forms of magic represented by the likes of John Nevil Maskelyne. It took something more shocking, such as the horrific productions of the Grand Guignol theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: \\"...beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\\". In contrast to the publicity given to Selbit, the names of the assistants who made this influential act work have received almost no publicity. There were two premieres of the illusion. Selbit first presented it to an audience in December 1920; however, on that occasion the spectators were a small group of invited theatrical agents and promoters who Selbit hoped would book the act. The public premiere then occurred on 17 January 1921 at the Finsbury Park Empire music hall after Selbit was hired by the Moss Empire group. According to Steinmeyer, the assistant at the 1920 preview was Jan Glenrose, Selbit's main assistant at that time. The public performances featured principal assistant Betty Barker. Many of these illusions, together with others that involve appearances, disappearances or escapes, involve assistants being shut in boxes of one sort or another. This has led to the nickname \\"box jumper\\" which, although it could be applied to a male assistant, is usually inferred to be a female assistant. One reason that has been given for the predominance of women in this role is that the illusions sometimes require an assistant that can fit into cramped spaces and women have an advantage in that they tend to be smaller and more limber than men. Feminist critics have taken the above aspects of illusions and performances as evidence to support claims that magic is misogynistic, but this view has been contested by some magicians and assistants. However, a few prominent assistants have stated that they deserve better recognition for their efforts and achievements (see \\"Documentaries\\" below). Some modern magic acts have preserved the glamorous elements of the female assistant iconography while attempting to give full recognition to female performers by billing women as equal partners in acts. A notable example was the husband and wife act The Pendragons, for which Charlotte Pendragon wore very revealing costumes and did traditional \\"box jumping\\" roles yet received equal billing with her husband. She was also honored in her own right as a top professional magician. Another example, although with more modest and conservative costuming, is Kristen Johnson, who receives equal billing with her husband Kevin Ridgeway when they perform together as a magic act and often stars in her own right as an escape artist.

Avago Balls  Avago Balls was the main game on the channel; it was a live show that broadcast on the channel for ten hours every day. It worked in a similar way to bingo with presenters pulling the balls and players buying electronic playing cards. The interactivity was emphasised with text messages being read while the balls were being pulled, a daily poll on a topical issue voted via the Sky remote again while playing and special prizes such as a weekly draw. No actual skill (or activity) was required to \\"play\\" Avago Balls. Players bought \\"cards\\" via their Sky remote handsets, and watched as the system checked them automatically against the balls that had been drawn. Claiming a win was done automatically too. One major innovation was that each player's cards were superimposed onto the broadcast picture by software running in their Sky set-top box (the box had to remain connected to Avago by phone during play; this link was used to download the cards' numbers and patterns). This gave a much stronger illusion of actually participating in game of skill rather than a lottery. Avago Balls was a revised version of the game that was played when the channel first launched. In the original version (called \\"Avago ‚Äì The Biggest Numbers Game in Town\\"), each game continued until someone had filled the required pattern of squares (like traditional Bingo). This resulted in relatively few winners, and long games (sometimes 30 balls or more on large patterns). In the revised (\\"Avago Balls\\") version, each game was a fixed length of 15 balls. Anyone who matched at least one square was deemed a \\"winner\\", and those who had matched the most squares (typically five or more) had their names displayed and read out by the presenters.  Avago with Gala  On 22 December 2005, Yoomedia announced the sale of Avago to the gambling operator Gala Coral. The deal was said to be worth ¬£5.1m in a move which would see the channel rebrand as Gala Bingo in the 3rd quarter of 2006. Gala TV launched in October 2006. It was planned for the channel to also launch on Virgin Media/NTL however today Gala only broadcasts on Sky, Freesat and Online. The only presenter from Avago to move to Gala was Liv Kennard.  Presenters  The longest lasting presenters were Mark Pell, Jemish Patel, Charlotte Gane, Lawrie Jordan. The. host of the biggest prize giveaways was Colin Murnane.

The quartet of Mingus, multi-instrumentalist Eric Dolphy, trumpeter Ted Curson, and drummer Dannie Richmond constituted Mingus' core working band at the time, and had been performing the material on this album for weeks at The Showplace in New York. To recreate this atmosphere, Mingus introduces the songs as if he were speaking to the audience, even admonishing them to not applaud or rattle their glasses. This explains why the recordings on Presents would seemingly give off the illusion of a live album, when in fact it is a studio album. The album was recorded in New York for the Candid label founded by Nat Hentoff. Mingus usually recorded on major labels like Columbia and Atlantic, but he was given more freedom on Hentoff's independent label. Presents has received positive reviews from jazz critics and is among Mingus' most acclaimed albums. The album has been listed as part of The Penguin Guide to Jazz's \\"Core Collection.\\" Music=Folk Forms, No. 1 \\"Folk Forms, No. 1\\" is built on a rhythmic pattern. According to Mingus, \\"they had to listen to what I do on the bass. If I changed it, they'd have to go a different way. This is a very flexible work. About the only other guidance I give them is that if I hear them doing something particularly good one night, I remind them of it next time we play the number and suggest they keep it in. But as a whole, it never comes out the same\\". This song features melodic drum work from Dannie Richmond and sympathetic interplay by Ted Curson and Eric Dolphy. The quartet also performed the tune in Antibes with the addition of Booker Ervin on tenor saxophone; the concert was released on the live album Mingus at Antibes. Original Faubus Fables \\"Original Faubus Fables\\", a.k.a. \\"Fables of Faubus\\", originally appeared on Mingus Ah Um as an instrumental. Mingus introduces it sarcastically as \\"dedicated to the first, or second or third, all-American heel, Faubus.\\" The lyrics are sung by Mingus and Dannie Richmond, denouncing segregation. Nat Hentoff's liner notes state, \\"In the club, the mood of the caricature was much more bitingly sardonic and there was a great deal more tension. Mingus says the other label would not allow him to record the talking sections, which he feels are an important part of the overall color and movement of the piece. This version is the way Mingus did intend the work to sound.\\" (On Mingus Ah Um, Columbia Records had refused to let Mingus include the song's lyrics due to their explicit political tones and controversial subject matter, which frustrated Mingus to some degree.) Eric Dolphy plays alto saxophone on this version, and he would perform many more on bass clarinet when he rejoined Mingus in 1964; one example from that year is the live recording from Cornell 1964, on which \\"Fables\\" was expanded to almost half an hour. What Love? \\"What Love?\\" is based on two standards: \\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\\" and \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\"; and was being played in the Down Beat Club in Los Angeles as far back as 1945. According to Mingus, \\"people thought we were crazy, and I only did it when there weren't too many around. They wanted to hear the beat all the time, but it always seemed to me that so long as you could feel the beat you didn't have to keep emphasizing it. Moreover, you can speed it up or make it slower, as happens in Yiddish and Spanish music. Why tie yourself to the same tempo all the time?\\". The piece features a complex, lyrical melody performed by Ted Curson and Eric Dolphy (first on alto saxophone, then bass clarinet). Curson solos, followed by Mingus, then Dolphy; however all four musicians play freely throughout the piece. This recording and another performance on Mingus At Antibes are particularly famous for the musical conversation between Mingus and Dolphy (on bass clarinet) that takes place before the second statement of the melody. All the Things You Could Be by Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your Mother \\"All the Things You Could Be by Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your Mother\\" is loosely based on \\"All the Things You Are\\", but according to Hentoff, \\"the musicians keep the original structure... but do not even play the tune's chord structure. The piece in general is based on A flat. Again, the rhythms change. There is no set beat, and yet there's an implicit rhythmic flow, up and down, throughout the work\\". Explains Dannie Richmond, \\"Mingus and I feel each other out as we go; but always, when the time comes back into the original beat, we're both always there. The best way I can explain is that we find a beat that's in the air, and just take it out of the air when we want it\\". Nat Hentoff concludes, \\"For once, in these sessions, everyone in a Mingus unit reached‚Äîand maintained‚Äîthat level of daring and that power to make their instruments become extensions of themselves\\".

It was produced by L!VE TV and filmed at the station's headquarters at Canary Wharf in London. The title for the show derives from the phrase meaning rejection, where \\"Spanish Archer\\" would be said to translate to \\"El Bow\\", hence \\"Given the elbow\\". The TV show deliberately took this in a very literal manner, and expanded the joke as far as it possibly could.  Content  The show would begin with Willams arriving on the set of a cartoon Spanish village, dressed in a Robin Hood style outfit, complete with toy bow and arrow, and declaring \\"I am El Bow, I am the Spanish Archer\\". The contradictions of the supposedly Spanish character, such as the costume, and Williams‚Äô undisguised Welsh accent, were played for laughs. After a few jokes with the studio audience, El Bow would open a door in the set, where the audience would be introduced to a character named Pedro Paella who wore a sombrero, an obviously fake moustache, and rode a toy donkey. After some witty banter, Paella would use an inflatable toy guitar to mime to a backing track of Flamenco music, while singing a comedy introduction to the first act. The tune of the song would always be the same. Pedro Paella appeared in 85 episodes before being succeeded by Terry Tenerife, played by Neville Wilding, later of The Fall. The acts would then be given one minute to perform, at which point El Bow would appear in the background, loading his toy bow and arrow, and pointing them at a cut-out of a bull, inviting the audience to decide whether the act should continue. If the audience wanted to see more, El Bow would vacate the stage until the end, at which point, they would be presented with a prize of a Seville orange. If the audience did not want to see more, El Bow would loose the arrow, and a large polystyrene elbow would swing onto the set, ushering the act off-stage. As things were redressed for the next act, three Flamenco dancers would appear for as long as was necessary. Typically, the half-hour show would see 4‚Äì6 acts, and at the end of the programme, El Bow would invite all the acts who successfully avoided the elbow back onto the stage, and the audience asked to pick a favourite. The winning act would be given a prize of a straw donkey. Unlike most talent shows, winners did not get to appear again, and there was no grand final, each episode being entirely self-contained. On occasions, the role of El Bow would be taken by Ruth Madoc. Like Williams, Madoc would exaggerate her natural Welsh accent, despite the character being supposedly Spanish.  Acts  Generally speaking, acts would be from the British Working men's club or cabaret circuits, or members of the public eager to join in or show their talents. Most were happy to play along with the show‚Äôs deliberately chaotic and self-mocking premise. Acts were not limited, meaning the show featured a variety of musical, comedy, and speciality acts. The only condition was that the act must be suitable for pre-watershed transmission.  Reception  Spanish Archer was heavily criticised, along with other L!ve TV shows such as Topless Darts and Britain's Bounciest Weather, as being an extreme example of dumbed-down or tabloid television. Despite that it gained a huge cult following.

The property is Grade I listed to reflect its importance \\"as part of the Flatford Mill group\\" and \\"its significance in the work of the artist John Constable\\". The earliest part of the building is sixteenth century. It was restored in the 1920s after a revival of interest in Constable's paintings. It has been renamed Willy Lott's House because this is the name Constable used in his paintings. It is owned by the National Trust. The cottage is located on the bank of the River Stour, just downstream from Flatford Mill in the heart of Dedham Vale, a typically English rural landscape. Flatford Mill, along with neighbouring Valley Farm and Bridge Cottage, are leased to the Field Studies Council, which uses them as locations for arts-based courses such as painting, and as accommodation for science-based courses such as residential ecology trips for students up to A-level.  William Lott  The cottage takes its name from its resident at the time John Constable did his paintings; at that time, the house was known as Gibeons Farm. William Lott (1761 - 1849), a tenant farmer, resided at Gibeons Farm and spent only four nights away from this house in the whole of his life. He is buried at St Mary the Virgin Churchyard in East Bergholt. According to a 2020 article, \\"Willy Lott himself became famous thanks to Constable, but only after his death\\". The cottage was purchased in 1926 by Thomas Parkington; after his death, the National Trust purchased it from his estate.

The revolver was also issued to the Army's \\"Dragoon\\" Regiments. This revolver was designed as a solution to numerous problems encountered with the Colt Walker. Although it was introduced after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, it became popular among civilians during the 1850s and 1860s, and was also used during the American Civil War.  Production  The Colt Dragoon Revolver was produced with several variations between 1847 and 1860, when the Colt Model 1860 revolver replaced it. All the improvements in design of Colt revolvers were applied to the Dragoons as well to the smaller models of Colt revolvers. Total production of Colt Dragoons including the 1,100 Walkers, from 1847 to 1860: 19,800; plus 750 Dragoons in a separate number range for the British market. For collectors, there are three different types with one \\"transition\\" model.  Whitneyville Hartford Dragoon Revolver  Between the Walker and the First model Dragoon, around 240 improved models were produced, barrel length 7 1/2 inch, cylinder 2 3/16 inch. Their general appearance was similar to that of the production Dragoon models. These were produced between late in 1847 and 1848, serial number range approximately 1100 (the last civilian Walker) through about 1340 (the first Dragoon First Model). These are sometimes called \\"Transition Walker\\" revolvers, and were made in two frame variations. The earlier pattern was a Walker carry-over with a cut-out in the back to accommodate the round contour of the grips and the second was straight-backed. Another distinctive detail were the very slender \\"Slim Jim\\" grips. Note: Due to serial number gaps between the \\"Transition\\" model and the First Dragoon, of which Colt later \\"backfilled\\", as well as the details of the production and delivery of the Second Government Contract, The \\"fluck Dragoon\\" was erroneously derived.  First Model  The First Model Colt Dragoon Revolver production began in 1848, stemming from Colt's Second Government Contract. It has oval cylinder stops, a V-type mainspring, no wheel on the rear of the hammer, and a square back trigger guard. Colt produced about 7,000 first models between 1848 and 1850.  Second Model  The Second Model has rectangular cylinder notches. Until the no. 10,000 the V-shaped mainspring was standard and then replaced with a flat leaf mainspring and a wheel on the hammer at its bearing on the mainspring. All the Second Model Dragoons have the squareback trigger guard. The company made about 2,550 Second Models in 1850 and '51.  Third Model  The Third Model Dragoon numbers stand at ten-thousand from 1851 through 1860.Wilson, R.L. Colt, An American Legend. New York-London: Artabras, A division of Abbeville Publishing Group 1985 This design had more variations as compared to its earlier counterparts. Some of the third model Colt Dragoon Revolvers had frame cuts for detachable shoulder stocks, horizontal loading lever latches and folding leaf sights. Third Colt Dragoon Revolvers had a round trigger guard. Government records showed an order for 8,390 Dragoons.  1848 Pocket Pistol  Other variants included the Colt \\"1848 Pocket Pistol\\" now known as the Baby Dragoon, marketed in California with success during the Gold Rush days. With the addition of a loading lever this evolved into the 1849 pocket revolver (see Colt Pocket Percussion Revolvers).

The Colt Dragoon Revolver had a comparatively shorter cylinder (thus preventing overloading the cylinder) and held up to 50 grains of powder, whereas the Walker had used up to 60 grains of powder. The Dragoon Revolver had a shorter barrel at 7.5 inches (some later revolvers 8 inches) as compared to the barrel on the Walker. A loading lever latch in front of the lever replaced the spring to keep the lever from dropping during recoil, thereby preventing jamming of the revolver. These variations made the Colt Dragoon Revolver 4 pounds two ounces. These changes also reduced the risks of the Colt Dragoon Revolver from exploding when fired, unlike the risk that had been demonstrated with the Walker revolvers.  Popularity  In the troublesome events that led to the Civil War, Colt Dragoons became extremely popular. In the beginning Colt Dragoon Revolvers were issued for the U.S. Army's Mounted Rifles. They were carried in pommel holsters on the saddle. The Colt Dragoon Revolver gained popularity among civilians in the Southwest where many had served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The Dragoon became a master weapon for civilians who hailed it as a powerful weapon of the time. Famous users included Joaquin Murietta, the California bandit, Charley Parkhurst, California teamster, James Douglas Byrd, Town Marshal, Watsonville, California, 1868, Tiburcio Vasquez, Union general George B McClellan,McClellan's Colt Dragoon at the Smithsonian and fictional Augustus McCrae, in the novel Lonesome Dove, Mattie Ross in the novel True Grit and in the 2010 film version (the 1969 film of that name had Mattie Ross using a Colt Walker revolver, though John Wayne's character Rooster referred to it as a Colt's Dragoon). Charley Parkhurst, while driving freight, was confronted by two bandits whom he dispatched with the Colt Holster Pistol. According to Harper's Weekly, James Butler (Wild Bill) Hickok arrived in Springfield, Missouri carrying a Dragoon though it is generally accepted that he used a Navy in his street duel with Davis Tutt.  Present  Firing a brace of Dragoons The Dragoon is now a collectible arm and sells for high prices. Non- firing replicas of the Colt 1848 Dragoon were manufactured at Denix in Spain. In 2005, a fire burned down the factory and destroyed the mold for the gun, which has since gone out of production. Denix has since reintroduced the non- firing model of the Colt 1848 Dragoon in Nickel. Quality Replica Dragoons are currently produced by the Aldo Uberti Company of Brescia, Italy and distributed in the United States by Taylors, Inc.; Cimarron Firearms, and others. They are quite accurate and potentially more powerful than the belt sized revolvers of the same bore diameter. Velocities with .451‚Äì457-inch round balls of approximately 141 grains over the full 50 grains of powder frequently show chronographed readings in the 1,000 to 1,100 foot per second range depending upon the powder used.Bates, Johnny, Cumpston, Mike (2005)Percussion Pistols and Revolvers, History, Performance and Practical use,Lincoln Nebraska, New York, London:iUniverse Publishers A cartridge-converted Colt Walker instead of the Colt Dragoon in the book was used in the 1969 film True Grit, as the weapon carried by 14-year-old Mattie, possibly due to the Walker's larger size. The Dragoon was used in the 2010 Coen Bros. movie as in the original book. In Lonesome Dove, by Larry McMurtry, Captain Gus McCrae is armed with a Colt's Dragoon revolver. In the television adaptation, Gus is armed with a cartridge-converted Colt's Walker revolver.

The company came into being in the mid-1960s when the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 225th Infantry was reflagged as Companies E and F (Ranger), 425th Infantry, and organized as Ranger companies. During this period these two companies were assigned to division and higher level commands to perform long range reconnaissance patrol missions, as opposed to the Ranger companies of today which comprise the four battalions (this includes the Special Troops Battalion) of the 75th Ranger Regiment.Ankony, Robert C., Lurps: A Ranger's Diary of Tet, Khe Sanh, A Shau, and Quang Tri, revised ed., Lanham, MD (2009). According to the United States Army Center of Military History, it was reorganized and redesignated as the 425th Infantry Detachment (LRS) effective 1 September 2008 and was relocated from the State of Michigan Pontiac Armory to the Selfridge Air National Guard Base near Mount Clemens, 15 miles northeast of Detroit.  History  At the conclusion of World War II the 125th Infantry Regiment, Michigan National Guard, returned to Detroit. A reorganization of the National Guard followed and the Detroit unit was redesignated the 425th Infantry Regiment. Regimental elements reorganized 1 September 1972 and Company E was redesignated Company F, 425th Infantry (Ranger).Woodworth, Maj. Thomas, \\"Heritage: F Company 425th Infantry,\\" Patrolling magazine, Winter-Spring 2006  Organization  Company F consisted of a large company headquarters and operations section, three patrol platoons, a communications platoon, and a parachute rigger section. Each patrol platoon consisted of a platoon headquarters and, at full strength, six 6-man patrol teams. Company F was historically an independent company within the Michigan National Guard, but for a period during the Cold War beginning in 1983, the company was aligned with VII Corps Headquarters in Stuttgart, West Germany, where it would deploy and serve as the corps Long Range Surveillance unit in the event of a NATO-Soviet conflict in Europe. Members of Company F held military occupational specialties (MOS) in the branches Infantry, Quartermaster Corps (Parachute Rigger 92R), Signal Corps and Military Intelligence. Since it was an airborne unit, members were required to attend the Army's Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning, GA.  Equipment  Co.F troops at Camp Grayling, MI Throughout the Cold War, many National Guard and Reserve forces were poorly equipped in comparison to the active component, however, Company F, given its importance as a long-range reconnaissance/Ranger unit was much better equipped than most. It was one of the first National Guard units to receive M16 rifles and M1956 equipment even before some active units. The unit was also historically equipped with the most modern communications equipment. As an airborne unit, Company F made use of T-10 static-line parachutes which is primarily used for jumps by the active military, allied military forces, as well as the Michigan Army and Air National Guard from UH-60 Blackhawks, CH-47 Chinooks, and C-130 Hercules transports. In the past, the unit also jumped from such aircraft such as the UH-1 Iroquois (Huey), C-123 Provider and the C-119 Flying Boxcar. It later transitioned to the MC1-1B and C parachute. In recent years the unit was equipped with the following weapons: the 5.56mm M4 carbine, the 5.56mm M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, the 40mm M203 grenade launcher, and the 9mm M9 pistol, consistent with active combat arms units of the U.S. Army.  Installations  Company F trained at the Selfridge Air National Guard Base Mount Clemens, MI; Fort Custer Training Center near Kalamazoo, MI; Camp Grayling MI; Puerto Rico; and has historically been headquartered at the Pontiac Armory in Pontiac, MI.  Deployments and Civil Actions  Co.F troops with full equipment exiting a C-130 Hercules Company F's first action was as part of the National Guard force brought to Highland Park to quell the Detroit riot of 1968, and performed its duties without casualties. This is not to be confused with the much more serious 1967 Detroit riot in which the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 225th Infantry participated. Unlike Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry, Indiana ARNG, Company F never deployed to Vietnam, but saw many training deployments during the period to locations including Puerto Rico and other stateside military installations. The company also participated in several REFORGER exercises in the 1980s. The unit won the Rhode Island International Parachute Competition 1st Place Team Trophy twice, in 1983 and 1987. In 1987, Airborne and Ranger-qualified personnel from Company F deployed to the United Kingdom and jointly trained with 21 Special Air Services (SAS). Company F was the first Army National Guard company ever to deploy from the US and jump into a simulated combat scenario in Puerto Rico. After the 9/11 attacks, several members of Company F were mobilized as a vanguard for the unit and were deployed to Iraq during the first phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom. They were designated as Company F, 250th MI Battalion and attached to Company H (LRS), 121st Infantry, Georgia ARNG. Company F was mobilized on 7 December 2003 and deployed to Iraq from February 2004 to February 2005, where it performed security operations, foreign internal defense training as well as normal LRS missions. Though several members were wounded through enemy action and received Purple Heart medals, Company F returned to Michigan with all soldiers that deployed a year earlier. Following its deployment, Company F continued training with the benefit of combat experience as a result of its one-year tour of duty in Iraq. 2nd Iraq deployment Company F was mobilized again on 9 May 2009 and deployed to Iraq from July 2009 to May 2010.  425th Regimental Association  The Association was formed and made official on 12 January 2002, with the adoption of its By-Laws. LTC Robert Wangen had proposed creating the Association and was elected as its first President. The mission of the 425th Regimental Association is to perpetuate the history, lineage and honors of Company F (RANGER), 425th Infantry as well as to look out for the welfare of our Company F members, past and present. Membership in the Association is open to anyone who served in Company F (LRRP/Ranger/LRS) 425th Infantry. The Association website is www.425regiment.org.

Search for \\"Around the World Unseen\\"  Insignia  Michigan National Guard griffin patch and 425th Airborne Ranger scroll Company F, 425th Infantry (LRS) wore the distinctive airborne tab above the griffin patch of the Michigan Army National Guard, distinguishing it as an airborne unit. Previously the unit had worn the Airborne Tab above the shoulder patch of the 201st Military Intelligence Brigade. Before being reflagged as a Long Range Surveillance Company, members of Company F wore a scroll with \\"AIRBORNE RANGER\\" in lieu of the common Airborne Tab above the griffin patch and the black beret with distinctive flash which identified them as Rangers. Upon designation as members of a LRS unit, soldiers of Company F switched to the maroon beret, the distinguishing feature of members of an airborne unit.

It can be due to interaction between electrostatic fields and net charge or electric polarization effects. The beam-like structure/element is generally cantilevered (fix at one of its ends). In nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are typical ones for electrostatic deflections. Image:Electric deflection CNT.JPG Mechanisms of electric deflection due to electric polarization can be understood as follows: Image:Electric polarization effect.jpg When a material is brought into an electric field (E), the field tends to shift the positive charge (in red) and the negative charge (in blue) in opposite directions. Thus, induced dipoles are created. Fig. 3 shows a beam-like structure/element in an electric field. The interaction between the molecular dipole moment and the electric field results an induced torque (T). Then this torque tends to align the beam toward the direction of field. Image:Electric induced torque.jpg In case of a cantilevered CNT, it would be bent to the field direction. Meanwhile the electrically induced torque and stiffness of the CNT compete against each other. This deformation has been observed in experiments. This property is an important characteristic for CNTs promising nanoelectromechanical systems applications, as well as for their fabrication, separation and electromanipulation. Recently, several nanoelectromechanical systems based on cantilevered CNTs have been reported such as: nanorelays, nanoswitches, nanotweezers and feedback device which are designed for memory, sensing or actuation uses. Furthermore, theoretical studies have been carried out to try to get a full understanding of the electric deflection of carbon nanotubes,Z. Wang et al., PRB, 75(16) In press.

He served as the second Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh from 1954 to 1960. If single tenures in the office of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Ministers are only considered, then Dr. Sampurnanand had the longest stretch from 28 December 1954 to 7 December 1960, which is almost six years in the office. Dr. Sampurnanand, a scholar of Sanskrit and Hindi, succeeded Govind Ballabh Pant. Advised by a council of ministers numbering 28, he governed Uttar Pradesh was asked to resign as Chief Minister following a political crisis in Uttar Pradesh initiated by Kamlapati Tripathi and Chandra Bhanu Gupta. Sampurnanand participated in the Non-cooperation Movement; edited Maryada, a Hindi monthly staffed by Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya in Benaras, contributed frequently to the National Herald and the Congress Socialist; was elected to the All-India Congress Committee in 1922, became provincial Minister for Education in the Uttar Pradesh cabinet, federal Minister from 1946 to 1951 and from 1951 to 1954, holding portfolios such as education, finance, and home labour; and, became Governor of Rajasthan from April 1962 to April 1967. The appointment of former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Dr. Sampurnanand as governor of Rajasthan heralded a new beginning in the Indian politics when spent forces in the politics were sent to hold gubernatorial positions. Life Sampurnanand was born on 1 January 1891 at Benaras (present-day Varanasi) and started life as a teacher. Brought up under the influence of the Benaras ethos, he was a strong votary of traditional culture. He was deeply interested in ancient Hindu culture including Sanskrit and Phalit Jyotish (astrology). His interest in phalit coupled with his academic bent of mind got him interested in astronomy. Babu Sampurnanandji was also an ardent freedom fighter. His jail-mates narrate that while under confinement in jail (as a freedom fighter) Babuji used to entertain them with discussions on astronomy and acquainted them with the night sky. Babuji had a modern outlook too and in this respect he was a curious mixture of diverse influences. After Independence, Babu Sampurnanandji became Education Minister in the first popular government of Uttar Pradesh. This instrumented in fulfilling his cherished astronomical dreams and drew up plans for establishing an astronomical observatory with a Time unit at the Government Sanskrit College, Benaras (GSC) (now Sampurnanand Sanskrit University). Dr Sampurnanand was first Chairman of State Lalit Kala Akademi, U.P. which was established on 8 February 1962 under the Department of Culture, Govt. of Uttar Pradesh as a fully funded autonomous body. Sampurnanand as a CM pushed Hindi (also Cow slaughter ban). As a reformist governor of Rajasthan promoted the idea of Sanganer‚Äôs no-bars prison. In this open prison convicts live with their families, go out to work and pay taxes for water and electricity. Sampurnanand believed that crime should not be looked as an act of revenge but as an act of reformation. Life imprisonment is like a death sentence for a convict as it results in a separation from family and friends. The Rajasthan government started the Sri Sampurnanand Khula Bandi Shivir (open jail), named after the governor, on an experimental basis in 1963.

Of special note is the great participation and involvement of the townsfolk of all ages in the event, through the many associations formed to meet the needs of the traditions and ritual acts that make up the festivity. The guilds, from which the age-old dances were born, underwent many changes with the industrial revolution in the late 19th century, providing their members with a window onto other social and professional environments.

It was Brown's second Cromwell painting, following Cromwell on his Farm (1875). Historical background After a series of massacres and dispossessions of Vaudois in Italy, Cromwell organised international action on their behalf, writing letters, raising financial contributions for victims and threatening military action. During his lifetime the persecutors reined back their attacks, but after his death the Vaudois were repeatedly persecuted. Milton's sonnet \\"On the Late Massacre in Piedmont\\" (\\"Avenge O Lord thy slaughtered saints\\") was also written at this time about the massacres. Painting Following the publication of Thomas Carlyle's Oliver Cromwell's letters and speeches, with elucidations (1845), Cromwell had been regularly portrayed in a heroic light in British art. His actions with regard to the Vaudois had been illustrated several times. Charles Rowley commissioned Brown to create the picture. > I commissioned him to paint for me the fine picture now at Manchester, > \\"Cromwell, Protector of the Vaudois.\\" I wanted a picture of John Milton, and > the result is this masterpiece: Cromwell, Milton, and Andrew Marvell, who > was then secretary to the blind poet.Rowley, C, Fifty Years of Work without > Wages, Hodder and Stoughton, p. 95. Brown's painting differs from earlier versions of the scene because of its highly dynamic composition designed to stress the relationship between Cromwell as a man of action and Milton as a powerful intellectual force, with Marvell energetically poised to execute their combined wills. In this respect the painting is a development of the central theme of Brown's earlier painting Work, but in this case emphasises the work of a \\"power elite\\" rather than ordinary manual labour. Cromwell's pose, splayed across the desk, is a development of earlier imagery in which Cromwell had been depicted as a rough or unceremonious figure.Trodd, C, Culture and Energy, Ford Madox Brown and the Cromwellian grotesque, Victorian Culture and the Idea of the Grotesque, 1998, pp. 68-73. His contained energy is emphasised by the precariously balanced desk, supported on a curved base with small stabilising feet. Milton's gesture is similarly transitory, finger raised, while the cropped, half-obscured figure of Marvell holds his pen ready waiting.

Core competencies for multiple section classes are the same, even when there are different teachers. Students have multiple opportunities for assessment of core competencies. They may include tests, quizzes, research papers, oral presentations, essays, and labs. Campbell was the first school in New Hampshire to introduce core competencies. A student must earn a grade of at least 65% in each competency in order to pass the course. If a student fails one or more of the core competencies in a course, he or she fails the course. Some courses are offered in summer school. In order to be eligible for summer school, a student must pass at least half the core competencies. Eligible students attending summer school are only required to master the core competencies they failed. Campbell Advisory Program All students at Campbell High School participate in the Campbell Advisory Program. Students meet with their staff advisors for ten minutes or longer in groups of approximately twelve. The CAP advisor is a spokesperson and an advocate for the best interests of each advisee. Each advocate is a contact person and a resource for his or her advisees. It is hoped that a lasting relationship can be developed in this context so each student feels he or she has a spokesperson who is approachable and works on his or her behalf. CAP also encourages trust, responsibility and mutual respect among a diverse group of students. Students of Campbell High School also have a policy where there is a formative and summative grading system. Formative is the class work or homework that isn't graded, it is simply checked off saying that it has been completed. Summative work are quizzes, test or other forms of work that the teacher or staff wants to be graded. Sophomore project All students must successfully complete and present a project during their sophomore year in order to graduate from Campbell High School. The Sophomore Project reflects a minimum of thirty hours of community service chosen by the student and approved by the sophomore project clearinghouse. Senior project The Senior Project is a requirement for graduation at Campbell High School for all seniors, as well as any students considering early graduation. The Senior Project is designed by each student and approved by the senior project clearinghouse, and must reflect at least forty hours of work. Completion includes a class presentation. These projects develop individual skills and knowledge in an area that the student chooses. Opportunities to gain credit for the project will be based on documented hours: 67.5 plus hours can earn one-half credit and 135 plus hours can earn one credit.

Formed by Ralph Sheldon in the months following the passage of the Volstead Act, the Sheldon Gang quickly became major liquor suppliers in Chicago's Southwest Side as well as a main supplier to Al Capone. The gang maintained an uneasy truce with the other rival gangs, until 1923, when a brief gang war broke out between the Sheldon Gang and the Southside O'Donnells until O'Donnell leader Edward O'Donnell was forced to leave Chicago after being severely wounded, by Frank McErlane, during a drive- by shooting on September 25, 1925. Once the O'Donnell's were eliminated, the Saltis-McErlane Gang, who had been allied to the Sheldon Gang, continued attacking the Sheldon Gang and by April of the following year the gang had lost their two top distributors, Frank DeLaurentis and John Tucillo. In October, a general amnesty had been ordered between Al Capone's Chicago Outfit and Bugs Moran's North Side Gang. However on December 30 Sheldon Gang member Hillory Clements was killed by the Saltis-McErlane Gang and in retaliation the Sheldon Gang killed Saltis gunmen Charlie Hubacek and Frank Koncil on March 11, 1927. Joe Saltis soon went to Capone who, in exchange for a large percentage of his profits, would negotiate peace between the two. During the later years of Prohibition the Sheldon Gang was suspected of supplying liquor to Capone rival Bugs Moran's North Side Gang. In the closing days of Prohibition and with the emergence of Lucky Luciano's National Crime Syndicate the Sheldon Gang, like most of the remaining bootlegging gangs, were absorbed into the syndicate by 1932. Some time in the 1930s, the Sheldons dropped a bomb from an airplane into an ice cream store, in Creve Coeur, Illinois. Further reading *Scandals of Prohibition Enforcement.

She started her working life as a nurse in Edinburgh but rose to prominence as a green political activist during and after the 1989 European Parliament election, in which the UK Green Party gained 15% of the votes but no seats. She resigned from the party in 1992, at odds with the party's anti-leadership stance, and went on to found the Forum for the Future with Jonathon Porritt and Paul Ekins. Her current campaigning focus is sustainability literacy as an essential outcome of formal education, especially in universities and colleges. She lives in Hackney, east London. Early life and education Sara Parkin was born in Aberdeen. She was educated in Coventry at Green Lane Primary School and Barr's Hill Grammar School. She then trained as a nurse at Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (1970‚Äì74) Career Parkin worked there as a ward sister at the Royal Infirmary. There, she met her husband Max, and her children Colin and Douglas were born there.Why Parkin sups with political devils, The Guardian, 18 September 1989 She tutored undergraduates in nursing at the University of Edinburgh (1972-3) and worked elsewhere in the health sector in the 1970s and 1980s before turning to politics. Politics On moving to Leeds in 1976, Parkin discovered the Ecology Party (as the UK Green Party was then known). She stood (unsuccessfully) against Keith Joseph in the 1979 general election and in several local elections. When her husband's work as a cancer epidemiologist took the family to live in Lyon France, she became involved with the international growth of green politics. This including leading on the establishment of the Coordination of (European) Green Parties (a grouping now known as the European Green Party for which she acted as Co- secretary and Spokesperson until 1991. With activists in other European Green Parties she provided support for green-oriented parties around the world, including dissident movements in east Europe.https://www.forumforthefuture.org/siteusers/sara-parkin Parkin emerged as the most articulate and telegenic Green Party spokesperson after 1989 and was credited with being committed to Green Party policy and practical in terms of political tactics. Caroline Lucas remembers being ‚Äúexhausted in the office and she‚Äôd burst through the door and bring with her new thoughts and ideas‚Äù while journalist Walter Schwartz considered her ‚Äúthe party‚Äôs best all-rounder, the easiest of the Greens to imagine as a Cabinet Minister. She is a highly organised political animal. Most Greens are not.‚Äù After an exploratory approach by the Labour Party, Parkin was defeated in her attempt at the 1989 Green Party conference to secure agreement to open negotiations with other parties on an alliance to bring in a proportional election system.Parkin is defeated over pre-election pact to achieve PR, The Independent, 25 September 1989 She was also associated with Green 2000, a group advocating constitutional changes to the Green Party, including the creation of an Executive Committee, with a Chair, a Regional Council, and only two principle speakers (Immediately after the 1989 election 32 speakers were offered to the press). The party voted to agree these changes, electing a Green 2000 supporter to every post, and Sara Parkin as Chair. This organisational structure is still in place. The 1992 general election results were not good for the Green Party largely because of predictions of a hung parliament, but also because of the ongoing internal disarray of the Green Party. Parkin resigned before the 1992 Green Party Conference citing the party's refusal to sanction what was openly described as a campaign ‚Äúto harry the (Green 2000) leadership at every opportunity until its members simply gave up in despair and quit.‚Äù John Morrissey, How Green Was My Party, Synthesis/Regeneration 13 (Spring 1997) The harrying persisted at the conference itself, with the last straw proving the party's ‚Äòopen door‚Äô to the controversial David Icke. Green Parties: An international guide, which Parkin published early in 1989 is out of print, but remains a benchmark study of green politics at that time. Her 1994 biography of her friend, German Green Party leader Petra Kelly The life and death of Petra Kelly is published in several languages most recently in 2016 in Spanish. Parkin remains an advocate of Green Parties, arguing consistently for the need to organise for success and the importance to that of good leadership. Life after politics Frustration in the aftermath of the 1992 UN Earth Summit led many UK green movement activists to think about different ways of implementing more sustainable ways of living and working. Parkin joined up with other former Green Party activists Paul Ekins and Jonathon Porritt to create in 1996 the Forum for the Future, a registered charity and non-profit with a mission to promote sustainable development through working in partnership with business, government and other organisations. For the Forum Parkin designed a pioneering Masters course in Leadership for Sustainable Development and worked mainly with education sector, government and the professions, particularly engineering, over 20 years to promote sustainability literacy in universities and colleges. Her 2010 book Positive Deviant: Sustainability Leadership in a perverse world, based on this experience is a course book in several universities around the world. She stepped down from day to day involvement with the Forum in 2016, but remains a Trustee. During this time, she also served on boards of the Environment Agency for England and Wales, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Leadership Foundation for Higher Education, the European Training Foundation and, at various times, NGOs such as Friends of the Earth, New Economics Foundation and Groundwork. Parkin continues to work with in education through The Sustainability Literacy Project, for which she is a Principal Associate. She also advises the National Union of Students on sustainability, and sits on the Boards of the Higher Education Academy and the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland. She is also a Patron of Population Matters and The Museum of Islay Life, Chair of the Richard Sandbrook Trust and Trustee of the St Andrews Prize for the Environment. Awards and honours Sara Parkin was awarded an OBE in 2000 for her services to education and sustainability, and holds honorary positions with several organisations, including the Institute of Energy, the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Engineering Council and the Society for the Environment. She has 11 honorary degrees.

Mardan Shah's family still living in Khunta village. His son name was Bhikham Dev Shah and Grand son Vaidyanath Prasad Pathak continued his dynasty.People of Hanumana started migrating to big cities like Indore, Bhopal, Mumbai and Delhi for education and jobs. The main income source of adjacent villages are farming. Demographics India census, Hanumana had a population of 14,873. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Hanumana has an average literacy rate of 53%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 64%, and female literacy is 41%. In Hanumana, 19% of the population is under 6 years of age. After the year 2000 Hanumana became an education hub for nearby villages however its business hub image went down drastically as all villages now have their own marketplace. Now many people from nearby villages come to Hanumana to pursue an education. Students pursue technical education like medical, Engineering , MBA and more migrate to other cities within and out of Madhya Pradesh. Landmarks in the town include a waterfall called Kurwa and a 150-year-old temple, Hanuman Temple. A myth about the temple is that lord Hanuman was born there. The festivals Diwali, Dashra, Rakhi and Holi are widely celebrated.

Pakistanis are the biggest non western group in Norway.https://www.kommuneprofilen.no/Profil/Befolkning/Bench/bef_innvandrere_land_bench.aspx History in Norway The initial first generation Pakistani Norwegians arrived in Norway as guest workers during the 1970s, under Norway's then- liberal immigration scheme which allowed for unskilled \\"guest workers\\" to temporarily settle in Norway. Most of these immigrants were young men that came from areas surrounding the town of Kharian, in Pakistan's Punjab province, though later waves included a high number of workers from Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. The law was later amended to allow for already arrived guest workers to permanently settle in Norway. Following stricter immigration laws passed in 1976, Pakistan immigration to Norway shifted from the arrival of new immigrants, to family reunifications, in which Pakistani Norwegians could apply for their close relatives and/or spouses to immigrate to Norway.  Employment  According to a 2014 report, nearly 60% of Pakistani Norwegian women born in Norway are employed. On the other hand, 35.2% of Pakistani immigrant women in Norway are employed. Counting full employment at 30 hours of work per week, 20% of Pakistani immigrant women in Norway were in full-time employment and 8% worked 1 ‚Äì 19 hours per week. By excluding part-time employment the statistics also showed that in 2017, males born in Norway with Pakistani heritage aged 30‚Äì39 had 16 percentage points lower employment compared to Norwegians. A study from 2012 revealed high degree of discrimination against jobseekers of Pakistani background : jobseekers with Pakistani names are 25% less likely to get a job interview than jobseekers with Norwegian names ‚Äì the qualifications of the Norwegian jobseekers and jobseekers of Pakistani heritage, and the job application letters, being identical. Lifestyle and integrating into Norwegian society Children of Pakistani immigrants sometimes struggle when trying to be loyal to both their family's traditional Islamic culture and the one of liberal Scandinavia. Second generation Pakistani Norwegians are sometimes told that they are different from Norwegians, although they feel at home only in Norway, while at home they may also be pressured by their parents to not become \\"too Norwegian\\". Riffat Bashir, Imam of Oslo's largest mosque often invites Norwegian church leaders and non-Muslim citizens to his mosque in order to partake in inter-faith and inter-ethnic dialogue. In the 1967 to 2010 period, 41% of all children born to Pakistani parents in Norway had parents that were cousins according to Norwegian Institute of Public Health statistics. Family-related chain migration marriage has been common among Pakistani Norwegians, but has become less common since the year 2000. A decreasing number of second generation Pakistani Norwegians, i.e. Pakistani Norwegians born in Norway, obtain spouses from abroad: In 2010, 81 persons migrated to Norway by marrying a second-generation Pakistani Norwegian. The number of unmarried second-generation Pakistani Norwegians above 17 years increased \\"from 1 100 in 1998 to 3 700 in 2010\\". The same trend is seen in the age group 18 to 23 years. In 2012, 24 Pakistanis migrated to Norway by marrying a second-generation Pakistani Norwegian aged 18‚Äì23. During the same period, the number of unmarried second-generation Pakistani Norwegians in the same age group increased \\"from 1,000 in 1998 to 2,700 in 2012\\". In 2014, 11 Pakistani spouses migrated to Norway by marrying a second-generation Pakistani Norwegians, aged 18‚Äì23. And in 2015, only 3 Pakistani spouses migrated to Norway in connection with marrying a second-generation Pakistani Norwegians, from the age group 18‚Äì23 years. Also fewer and fewer first-generation Pakistani Norwegians, ie Pakistani immigrants in Norway, obtain spouses from abroad. In 2012, 10 Pakistani immigrants in Norway, aged 18-23, married spouses from Pakistan, even though \\"the number of unmarried immigrants from Pakistan residing in Norway has increased somewhat\\" in the period 1998 to 2012. Among young second-generation Pakistani Norwegians, it is now \\"almost as unusual to be married at the beginning of their twenties\\" as \\"it is generally among young people in Norway.\\" This development can be explained by the fact that Pakistani Norwegians today have more potential marriage partners to choose among in Norway, and with the increasing participation of Pakistani Norwegians in higher education.. Second-generation Pakistani-Norwegian women give in average birth to 1,95 children each, the same average as Norwegian women in general. According to statistics from 2009 Pakistani Norwegians generally had a spouse of Pakistani ancestry. The percentage of males marrying outside their ethnic group were slightly higher than among the females. However more than 1000 children were registered in 2008 to have one Pakistani parent and one with Norwegian background. Thus, there must be more couples of mixed ethnicity having children than the number of marriages indicates. Partners having the same religious faith is important to 83% of Pakistani migrants in Norway and 77% of the second generation. Politics Hadia Tajik- First Muslim MP and minister in Norway The Pakistani Norwegian community does not vote as a bloc for any particular party in Norway. Rather, there is a diversity of political beliefs, demonstrated by support for a variety of parties. Many Pakistani Norwegian politicians have been successful in their political campaigns. Hadia Tajik who was born in Norway of Pakistani parents became minister of culture in 2012. She is elected to the parliament from Oslo, and is (2018) vice chair of the Labour Party. Akhtar Chaudhry was until 2013 Member of Parliament and vice-president of the Parliament representing the Socialist Left Party. He migrated to Norway from Pakistan in 1982 and was the former head of the Pakistan Norwegian Welfare Organization. Afshan Rafiq is a former member of Stortinget for Conservative Party. She still is still (2018) a deputy MP, representing the Oslo electoral district. Abid Raja is a Member of Parliament representing the Liberal Party from the Akershus electoral district. Many Pakistani Norwegians are also involved in lower-level political life as members of regional councils and city councils. They have been particularly well represented in the Oslo city council, where they made up 10% of council members from 2003 to 2007.√ònsker flere pakistanere i Norge VG, September 9, 2006 Media & Entertainment Deeyah is the first mainstream recording artist of Pakistani heritage in Norway and is the first and only female World music producer of Norwegian Pakistani descent.

The film is set in Oslo and deals with the double standards in a tough Pakistani Norwegian gang environment. It relates directly to the difficulty of being raised as a Muslim immigrant in western countries. The word Izzat means honour in Urdu. A number of Pakistani Norwegians were featured in this film, and a small portion was filmed in Lahore, Pakistan. Education Almost 10% of the medical students in Oslo are of Pakistani heritage. The figure is significant as Pakistani Norwegians only constitute 3.67% of Oslo's population.

Early life Perry was born in Hackney, Middlesex, the third son of John Perry, sheriff of Essex and shipbuilder, and his second wife, Mary, daughter of George Green. The Perrys and the Greens were deeply involved with Blackwall_Yard, one of the largest private shipyards in the world. George Green was a noted philanthropist, underwriting the architecturally significant Trinity Independent Chapel and its associated \\"minister's house, sailors' home, schools, and almshouses\\". and a school named after him Charles was educated at private schools at Clapham Common and Hackney, then for four years at Harrow, where he played in the school cricket eleven.A. de Q. Robin, 'Perry, Charles (1807 - 1891)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, pp 432-436. Retrieved 3 September 2014 Perry was a contemporary of Charles Wordsworth, nephew of the poet, and Henry Edward Manning; all three young men became bishops, albeit in different churches. At Harrow, due to some youthful folly, the headmaster asked Perry's mother to remove him and send him to private tutors. In 1824 he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. (1828) as senior wrangler, first Smith's prizeman and 7th in the first class of the classical tripos. Christopher Wordsworth, father of his friend, was Master of Trinity from 1820 to 1841. Perry was elected a fellow of Trinity College in 1829, was awarded and M.A. in 1831 and began reading for the bar, but his health broke down, and in 1832 he returned to Trinity College as assistant-tutor and later tutor. Clerical career and to Australia While at Cambridge Perry was ordained deacon on 16 June 1833 and a priest on 26 November 1836 by the bishop of Ely. Perry purchased the Advowson of the living of Barnwell, vested the patronage in trustees and secured the erection of two churches. Of one of these, St Paul's, Perry became the first vicar in 1842, and five years later was appointed the first Bishop of Melbourne. He sailed on the Stag on 6 October 1847 and arrived in Port Phillip District (later named Victoria) on 23 January 1848. Perry discovered that there was one over-burdened cleric in Melbourne and one each in Geelong and Portland. Perry had brought three clergy with him and there were three lay readers, thus making with the bishop a total of nine persons to minister to a district as large as Great Britain. Bishop Broughton of Sydney had given up ¬£500 a year towards the stipend of the new bishop, but there were no diocesan funds and the whole organisation of the diocese had to be worked out and built up. The government offered the bishop two acres (0.8 hectare) of land for a site for his house a little more than a mile from the post office, or alternatively five acres farther out, and set aside ¬£2000 for the building of a house. Perry decided it would be better to be within easy walking distance of the city. His house, however, was not completed until 1853. In July 1851 Victoria was constituted a separate colony distinct from New South Wales, and a few weeks later the discovery of gold leading to the Victorian gold rush resulted an enormous influx of population. Perry had succeeded in obtaining about ¬£10,000 for the organization of his diocese from societies and friends in England, however there was little prospect of receiving substantial amounts in the future. Several new churches and schools had been built, and the number of clergy had more than trebled. It was, however, difficult to obtain additional clergy, and the cost of building for a time was exceedingly high during the gold rush era. Perry visited the goldfields and in the meanwhile made what arrangements he could. Another problem was the framing of a constitution for the Church of England in Victoria. In this he had the valuable assistance of Sir William Foster Stawell. A bill was prepared and brought before the Victorian Legislative Council and eventually passed. But there had been some determined opposition to it, and it was known that a petition had been sent to England praying that the royal assent should not be given. Perry was therefore sent to London in 1855 to be able to answer any objections that might be made, and though difficulties were encountered, the assent was eventually given, and Perry returned to Melbourne in April 1856. Whilst in England Perry chose a headmaster for the Melbourne Church of England Grammar School, John Edward Bromby. On 30 July 1856 the foundation stone of the school building was laid, and less than a year later the new buildings for the Geelong Church of England Grammar School, established in 1855, was also begun. In 1863 Perry again visited England principally to arrange for clergy to come to his diocese, but it was strongly felt that it would be necessary to provide better for the training of their own clergy in Victoria. On 10 January 1870 Perry laid the foundation stone of Trinity College at the University of Melbourne, but it was not until Alexander Leeper was appointed warden in 1876 that the college made a fair start. Since then several Australian bishops and many clergy have been among its old students. Return to England It was decided in 1872 that the diocese should be divided and a bishop appointed at Ballarat; in February 1874 Perry went to England to find a suitable man for this position. The Revd Samuel Thornton was selected and consecrated in May 1875 and Perry abandoned his intention of returning to Melbourne, resigning early in 1876. Perry assisted in finding a successor, who was James Moorhouse. In 1878 Perry was made a canon of Llandaff Cathedral, and in the same year Prelate of the Order of St Michael and St George. In his last years he did much committee work in connexion with missionary societies and was one of the founders of Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, and Ridley Hall, Cambridge. Perry died on 2 December 1891 and was buried at Harlow, Essex. He married, in 1841, Fanny, the daughter of Samuel Cooper, who survived him. He had no children. He published in 1856 Five Sermons preached before the University of Cambridge in November 1855, and in 1864, Foundation Truths: Four Sermons. Various addresses and sermons were also published separately. Legacy Perry was a fine scholar and a good administrator who showed wisdom in the conduct and building up of his diocese. When he left it, the number of his clergy had grown to 90. He was an extreme Evangelical and his fear that his church might be Romanized became overimportant with him. He made no claim to being a theologian, but was \\"content to believe in the bible\\". Perry's portrait by Henry Weigall is at the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne.

Etymology The mountains of Barx village Tackling the etymology of the place name \\"Barx\\" is no simple matter and has caused heated controversy between scholars of Roman and Moorish languages and dialects. The place name occurs in many forms in ancient texts. Moorish scholars contend that the first name identified as connected with Barx is Bodj Aldjabal (the \\"tower of the mountains\\"). Humbler beginnings come out of other associated words and Christian scholars favour Perxe ‚Ä¶an old word meaning 'cabin' ‚Ä¶corrupted into Berxe by Arab pronunciation. Tower or cabin, bordj or berxe, what is important is the fact that the historical existence of the name attests to the presence of a community with an ancestry that dates back to the first millennium. The long history of the village with its geographic isolation has caused two juxtaposed social attitudes to flourish alongside each other ‚Ä¶the desire for contact with the outside world and a preference for the safety of isolation from it. Perched at a considerable height (some 1,300 feet above sea level) with respect to the whole natural district of the Commonwealth (or Mancomunitat) of Valldigna, Barx is the sole mountain community and this geographic semi-isolation has fostered a high degree of \\"cultural independence\\" and this is the key to understanding the peculiarity of the past and present of the village of Barx. Prehistory The Parpall√≥ cave (Gandia) and the one at Malladetes (Barx) constitute two of the more important sites in the Mediterranean peninsular region. The archaeological materials obtained from the caves attest to the area being occupied uninterrupted between 29,000 years ago and a date just 11,000 years ago. The people developed a hunter-gatherer way of life. The culture can be characterised by the elaborate utensils made from both stone and bone. One of the singular aspects of the Parpall√≥ cave is the rich collection cave paintings and limestone engravings depicting animals and other topics. The existence of these scenes confirms a high artistic and symbolic capacity of the ancient population.

World War II On 4 August 1943, Boldt was awarded a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for extreme bravery. He was a Senior-Lieutenant (Oberleutnant) with the 58th Infantry Division on the Eastern Front. Boldt also served as a cavalry officer. During the last months of World War II, Boldt was seconded to Reinhard Gehlen's military intelligence staff. He was stationed in German dictator Adolf Hitler's F√ºhrerbunker. This was located below the Reich Chancellery in central Berlin. Boldt reported to General Hans Krebs and was summoned to a daily briefing session with Hitler, his generals, and closest associates - in particular Martin Bormann, Hermann G√∂ring, and Joseph Goebbels. Boldt had a unique opportunity to observe at close quarters the leading members of the Nazi hierarchy during the Battle of Berlin. After the war, he wrote about his experiences during the last days in Nazi-held Berlin. Boldt's description of the atmosphere, first in the semi-ruined Reich Chancellery and then in the claustrophobic surroundings of the F√ºhrerbunker, convey a chilling impression of destruction and of the collapse of the entire Nazi system. Background By 21 April 1945, Soviet Marshal Georgi Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defenses of German General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula on the Seelow Heights. Having achieved the breakthrough, the Soviets were advancing towards Berlin with little to stop them. Adolf Hitler, ignoring the facts, saw salvation in the ragtag units commanded by one of his favorite generals, Felix Steiner. Steiner's command became known as \\"Army Detachment Steiner\\" (Armeeabteilung Steiner). Unfortunately for the Germans, Army Detachment Steiner was an army which existed primarily on paper: it was something more than a corps but less than an army. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the huge salient created by Zhukov's breakthrough; and the German Ninth Army, commanded by General Theodor Busse, which had been pushed to the south of the salient, was ordered to attack northward in a pincer movement. Late on 21 April, Heinrici called Hans Krebs, chief of the German General Staff (OKH), and told him that Hitler's plan could not be implemented. Heinrici asked to speak to Hitler but was told by Krebs that Hitler was too busy to take his call. Army Detachment Steiner fails to launch an attack Of 22 April, Boldt wrote the following concerning Hitler's breakdown during one of his last conferences: :\\"Hitler interrupted the report to ask what had happened to General Felix Steiner's offensive . . . There was a long silence and then Hitler was told that the attack had never been launched, and that the withdrawal from Berlin of several units of Steiner's army, on Hitler's orders, had so weakened the front that the Russians had broken through into Berlin.\\" :\\"That was too much for Hitler. He asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Jodl, Hans Krebs and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room . . . \\" :\\"Then Hitler started jumping up and down, while he ranted and raved. His face turned white and purple in turns, and he was shaking all over. His voice kept breaking, as he screamed out the words disloyalty, cowardice, treachery, and insubordination. There followed accusations against the Wehrmacht and the Waffen-SS, of the kind that previous explosions had brought out in somewhat milder form. His outburst culminated in the oath that he would remain in Berlin, with the Berliners, that he would lead the fight personally -- let all who wish to desert him and the city do so now. And then something happened that none of those present had ever seen or expected to see. Hitler suddenly returned to his chair and collapsed. He stammered out: 'It's all up . . . the war is lost . . . I shall shoot myself.' \\" Dollinger, Hans. The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Library of Congress Catalogue Card # 67-27047, p. 231 Almost immediately after Hitler's plan for Steiner failed to launch, a new plan was created. The new plan involved General Walther Wenck and his Twelfth Army. Wenck's army faced the Americans to the west. The new plan had Wenck attack with his army to the east, link up with the Ninth Army of General Theodor Busse, and relieve Berlin. Of 25 April to 26 April, Boldt wrote the following about Hitler's order to flood the underground railway: :\\"When we arrived for the talk, Hitler rose and we followed him into the conference room. Though no encouraging message from General Walther Wenck (Twelfth Army) had been received, Hitler continued to clutch at that straw. Regardless of the fate of the starving, thirsting, and dying population, he was determined to postpone the inevitable end even further. And then he gave one of the most inhuman of all his orders: because the Russians had repeatedly thrown back the German lines by advancing through the underground and other railway tunnels to attack the German forces from the rear, he now detailed special units to open the locks of the river Spree, thus flooding the railway tunnels south of the Reich Chancellery. These tunnels were crammed with civilians and thousands of wounded. They were no longer of interest to him. His insane order cost the lives of very many people.\\" Dollinger, Hans. The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Library of Congress Catalogue Card # 67-27047, p. 233 Last days in the F√ºhrerbunker Of 28 April, Boldt documented the following discussions between Martin Bormann, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf: :\\"At about 2:00 am, I lay down completely exhausted and tried to catch a few hours of sleep. Noise drifted across from the room next door, where Martin Bormann, Hans Krebs, and Wilhelm Burgdorf sat carousing. I must have been asleep for two-and-one-half hours when Bernd (Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven) in the bunk beneath me woke me up. 'You really are missing something, just listen to that!' he whispered. Burgdorf was shouting at Bormann: 'Believe me, I have done my very best to smooth things over between Hitler and the Army, so much so that the Army has called me a traitor to the German Officers' Corps. Now I realize that they were right all along, that my work was in vain, my idealism misdirected, no, naive and stupid.' Breathing heavily, he paused for a moment. Krebs tried to calm him down and begged him to spare Bormann's feelings.\\" :\\"But Burgdorf went on regardless: 'Just leave me to it, Hans, it has to be said for once. In forty- eight hours it may well be too late. Our young officers went into battle full of faith and idealism. They went to their death by the hundred-thousand. But for what? For their Fatherland, for Germany's greatness and future? For a decent life? In their hearts they did, but nowhere else. They died for you, for your pockets, for your boundless ambitions. Thinking they were dying for a just cause, our youth allowed themselves to be bled to death on the battlefields of Europe, sacrificing millions of innocent lives, while you, the Party leaders, waxed richer and richer, living it up like lords, accumulating untold riches, stealing vast estates, building castles, reveling in luxury, deceiving and milking the nation. Our ideals, our morals, our faith, our soul -- all these you have ground into dirt; mankind was only a stepping stone for your insatiable greed. You have destroyed our ancient culture, you have broken up our nation. That is your only achievement!' \\" :\\"The general's voice had risen to a roar. Now the bunker was quite still. We could hear his breath come in gasps. Then we heard Bormann's cool, superior, and oily voice. All he had to say was this: 'My dear fellow, do you really have to be so personal? Even if the others have filled their pockets, I myself am free of blame. That I swear to you by all I hold dear. Cheers my friend, and drink up!' \\" Dollinger, Hans. The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, Library of Congress Catalogue Card # 67-27047, p. 237 Early on 29 April, Freytag- Loringhoven informed Boldt that Hitler had married Eva Braun. Boldt was laughing at the news when Krebs came from behind a curtain and chastised him: \\"Have you gone quite mad? How dare you laugh at your highest commander?\\" Escape On 29 April, three couriers left Berlin. Each left with a copy of the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. Communications were down, the Soviets were closing in, and many were morbidly anticipating Hitler's suicide. Boldt's friend, Bernd von Freytag-Loringhoven, obtained permission for them to leave. That evening, Boldt left the F√ºhrerbunker with von Freytag-Loringhoven and Burgdorf's assistant, Lieutenant-Colonel Rudolf Weiss.Beevor, Antony. Berlin: The Downfall 1945, Penguin Books, 2002, , pp. 350-351 Weiss became separated from his two companions and was captured. He endured five years of captivity in a Soviet POW camp in Poland. At night when Boldt and von Freytag- Loringhoven were hiding in a ditch in a forest, Boldt attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose of morphine. Von Freytag-Loringhoven forced him to regorge the morphine and thus saved his life. On 12 May, after several close encounters with Soviet forces, the two other men parted company; Boldt going north to Lubeck and von Loringhoven heading towards Leipzig to join his wife and son.In the Bunker with Hitler, Bernd Freytag von Loringhoven, Orion Publishing Group 2005, pp 183 Post-war Boldt became a writer. He wrote Hitler's Last Days: An Eye-Witness Account (). This book was translated by Sandra Bance and was used for the films Hitler: The Last Ten Days (1973) and Downfall (2004; Der Untergang).

A member of the Liberal Party, he represented the electoral district of Heathcote in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for a single term, from 1988 to 1991. Andrews was born in Bargo, where his father worked. The family moved to Heathcote, in Sydney, in 1943. Andrews attended public school in Heathcote, and went on to further education at St George Technical College. After completing his education, Andrews worked as a self-employed electrical contractor. Andrews was elected to the Sutherland Shire Council as an Independent candidate in 1974, and served there for the next thirteen years, including a two-year stint as Council President. He joined the Liberal Party in 1986, and was soon chosen to contest the seat of Heathcote, which was up for by-election following the August 1986 resignation of disgraced former Labor Minister Rex Jackson. The Labor government delayed the by-election as long as possible, arguing that it was not possible to hold an election during Jackson's trial or while Parliament was sitting. The Leader of the Opposition, Nick Greiner, rejected this argument, declaring that the election was only delayed in an attempt to allow any bad press from the corruption trial to die down. The election finally came on 31 January 1987, and was rarely short of drama: Jackson, with criminal charges hanging over his head, entered as a spoiler candidate; the Liberals found themselves in hot water over an illegally large billboard prominently placed on the electorate's border over the Princes Highway; and the ALP were accused of sabotage after vandals cut loose from its moorings a Liberal advertising blimp. In the election itself, Andrews garnered more than 8,000 of the approximately 28,000 votes cast and narrowly missed out to Labor candidate Ian McManus. When the seat came up for re-election in 1988, McManus had moved to the newly created safe seat of Burragorang, and redistribution of boundaries had made winning Heathcote a much less daunting prospect for the Liberals. Andrews defeated Labor's rearguard candidate Peter Predsee, becoming the first Liberal candidate to win a seat in the Illawarra region and the first non-Labor member for the seat of Heathcote. On 25 September 1990, the Greiner Liberal Government announced a controversial redistribution proposal to reduce the number of seats, and MPs, from 109 to 99 after the upcoming election. Andrews was one of five Liberal MPs to see his district cut out from under him, a prospect he decried in the run-up to the 1991 NSW election. At the expiration of his term, Andrews was requested to run for the nearby but traditionally safe Labor district of Coogee. With the odds against him ‚Äì Andrews moved to the district two months before the election, and came up against Ernie Page, a Labor institution in the electorate ‚Äì he came close to winning, missing out by 600 votes after preferences. After leaving politics, Andrews continued to serve in the NSW government, this time as policy analyst for the NSW Water board.Questions and Answers No. 18 Upon hearing of Andrews' appointment, the Labor Party, then in Opposition, argued that it was just a case of \\"jobs for the boys\\", saying that the normal hiring procedures had been bypassed in Andrews' case. The Government responded by saying that Andrews had earned the job on his own merit, and that positions such as his were not normally advertised anyway.

He was known for his legal action against the Police and the Dutch intelligence service. He was murdered by former comrade Marcel Teunissen in 2005. Life S√©v√®ke lived in Nijmegen from 1984, and later stopped his studies to become a full-time activist, involved in several squatting movements. He lived at the Grote Broek. In 1990 he authored a book about the intelligence, called De tragiek van een geheime dienst ('The tragedy of a secret service'), and he wrote for publications including Buro Jansen & Janssen,NRC Handelsblad and Vrij Nederland. He used his knowledge of security services and law to sue government agencies, and set up an organisation called Werkgroep Klachten Politieoptreden (Workgroup for complaints against acts of the police) that denounced police and judicial actions. Death Grave of Louis S√©v√®ke S√©v√®ke was shot dead, aged 41, in the city centre of Nijmegen on 15 November, 2005. Family and friends were baffled as to the identity of the murderer. Since that time rumours of involvement of police or secret services have abounded. A year after the murder the police seemed to have made little headway. It has been suggested that the Dutch secret service (AIVD) had a 24/7 surveillance on S√©v√®ke at the time of his murder; however, there were no signs of information coming from the secret service to the police. Teunissen On 28 March 2007 the public prosecutor on the case revealed that a 38-year-old man from Rotterdam, named Marcel Teunissen according to the Spanish police, had confessed to the murder. The murderer and victim knew each other from the squatting movement. The following day, it was revealed that revenge might have been the motive for the murder. Some people suggest that S√©v√®ke suspected Teunissen to be an informant of the intelligence agency, and Teunissen had \\"sworn revenge\\" in his diary for being removed from the squatting scene because of that suspicion. S√©v√®ke's family denies that Teunissen was removed from the scene but instead went away himself as a result of a discussion on taking money from houseowners for leaving. It was also suggested that the two men were linked since S√©v√®ke had earlier helped Teunissen escape from prison. Teunissen was convicted of the murder of S√©v√®ke in March 2008, and was sentenced to full life imprisonment.

According to the Swiss Federal Act on the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source, a good or service may be designated \\"Swiss made\\" if: * For food products: 80% of the weight of the raw materials and the essential processing must take place in Switzerland. * For industrial products: 60% of the manufacturing costs and the essential manufacturing step must occur in Switzerland. * For services: the company headquarters and administration must be located in Switzerland. Most often associated with watches or timepieces made in Switzerland, Swiss law considers a watch to be Swiss made if its movement is Swiss, if the movement has been assembled in the Swiss region, its final inspection occurred in Switzerland, and at least 60% of manufacturing costs are domestic. Besides the \\"Swiss made\\" requirements, watches may carry the Swiss movement (\\"Swiss Movt\\") marker if at least half of the assembled parts are of Swiss manufacture. In addition to \\"Swiss made\\" and \\"Swiss Movt\\", under Swiss law watches may carry the words \\"Suisse\\", \\"produit suisse\\", \\"fabriqu√© en Suisse\\", \\"qualit√© suisse\\" or simply the English translation, \\"Swiss\\". Outside of the jurisdiction of Switzerland, the legal requirements for use of the term \\"Swiss made\\" may differ. Overview The wording was formally adopted in the late 19th centuryAux origines du Swiss made horloger and is unique in that most other countries use the phrase \\"Made in (Country Name)\\". The most obvious place where the label is found is on Swiss watches. The Swiss laws permit the use of the words \\"Suisse\\", \\"produit suisse\\", \\"fabriqu√© en Suisse\\", \\"qualit√© suisse\\" or the translations, \\"Swiss\\", \\"Swiss made\\", or \\"Swiss Movement\\". On some older watches, for example, the word \\"Swiss\\" appears alone on the dial at the six o'clock position. There are two discrete sections of the Swiss law that pertain to the use of the name Swiss made. The first law, which applies to all types of Swiss products, is the \\"Federal Act on the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source\\".Federal Act on the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source, Federal Chancellery of Switzerland, status as of 1 January 2017 (page visited on 17 October 2018). Its article 50 provided the authority for the enactment of the second law, Ordonnance du 23 d√©cembre 1971, relating specifically Swiss watches. The text of either law is available in French, German or Italian, since those are the principal official languages of Switzerland. Swiss watches Currently the aforementioned Swiss legal standards permit watch brands or watchmakers to label watches Swiss made under certain legally defined circumstances. These standards have changed over time and were not always codified in the national law, so older watches which bear the mark Swiss made may not necessarily meet the current legal definition. On the other hand, they might well exceed the current legal definition of Swiss made. Indeed, the current law of the applicability of Swiss made was codified on 23 December 1971. Swiss watches A Swatch watch labeled \\"SWISS\\" to indicate it is made in Switzerland The Ordinance regulating the use of the name \\"Swiss\\" on watches first defines a \\"watch\\" (as opposed to a clock) by the dimensions of its movement. Thereafter, the law defines a Swiss watch, the definition of which is dependent on certain aspects of its movement. The law then goes on to define under what circumstances a watch movement may be considered Swiss made. The law then sets forth the conditions for the use of the name Swiss on watches, on watch cases, on watch movements, on watch dials and on replacement watch parts. In sum, a watch is considered Swiss whose movement is encased in Switzerland and whose final control by the Manufacture d'horlogerie takes place in Switzerland. The legal standards for the use of \\"Swiss made\\" on a watch are a very minimum standard, and the Swissness of a watch is largely dependent on the brand and its reputation. The Swiss watch industry has not reached an agreement over the specific definition of Swiss made, as some companies favor stricter regulations and others prefer including lower-cost foreign components. The Swiss Federal Council modified the ordinance regulating the use of the \\"Swiss\\" name for watches in 1995. This revision was explained in a press release entitled On foreign parts for watches. Des composants √©trangers pour les montres Swiss Made defined by lawSwiss watch= A watch is considered Swiss, according to the Swiss law if: * its movement is Swiss and, * its movement is cased up in Switzerland and; * the manufacturer carries out the final inspection in Switzerland =Swiss watch movement= A watch movement is considered Swiss if: * the movement has been assembled in Switzerland and, * the movement has been inspected by the manufacturer in Switzerland and; * the components of Swiss manufacture account for at least 50 percent of the total value, without taking into account the cost of assembly. From 1 January 2017, the law set the minimum at 60 percent.Federal Act on the Protection of Trade Marks and Indications of Source, see The new 'Swissness' legislation , Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property, 21 November 2016 (page visited on 17 December 2016). If a watch movement is intended for export and will not be cased-up in Switzerland, but it otherwise meets the criteria to be considered a Swiss movement, the watch may say \\"Swiss Movement\\" but it may not say Swiss made on the watch case or dial. A watch that says \\"Swiss Quartz\\" is considered to be a proper Swiss watch. However, it is often improperly used by foreign manufacturers to merely indicate that the quartz movement is of Swiss origin. 60% rule for Swiss-made watches Use of the Swiss made label for watches is covered by an ordinance of the Federal Council dated 29 December 1971. The Swiss standard is often pejoratively referred to as the 60% Rule. However, it has its basis in real life economics. Again, the law merely sets forth a minimum standard. The famous or infamous Swiss Made Ordinance has, for a number of years, been subject to many criticisms, particularly inside the industry, because it is considered too lax, but also in legal circles, where the view is that it no longer fully meets the legal mandate specified in the companion law on trademarks (SR 232.11). > It is not generally known that quite a few Swiss companies have watches > assembled in China for export to North America, Asia and even Europe, where > the brand name is more important than the ‚ÄúSwiss made‚Äù label. Such watches > may consist of a Chinese case and a Chinese crystal, a Taiwan-made dial and > metal bracelet and Japanese hands. If the movement is to be considered > Swiss, 51% of its value must be Swiss and at least the last wheel must be > added in Switzerland. Swiss watch brands without the ‚ÄúSwiss made‚Äù label are > usually equipped with a Japanese movement. The ‚ÄúSwiss parts‚Äù label means > that the movement is assembled in Asia using kits consisting at least > partially of Swiss made components.Diluted with Parts that Aren't Swiss > April 5, 2005The Year of Living Dangerously April 14, 2004 From time to time namely in 2003 and more particularly in 2007, there are efforts made to strengthen the definition of \\"Swiss made.\\" These efforts are normally spearheaded by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH (FH) a trade organization. 30 companies have opposed such efforts under which the lobbying group IG Swiss made. Many are afraid to share their identity wthejournal.com but Ronnie Bernheim, co-CEO of Mondaine, has been outspoken on this issue, and defends \\"Swissness more as a promise than a physical manifestation.\\" thelocal.ch Mondaine admits that it uses non-Swiss dials and cases though Bernheim has declined to disclose their country of origin.Business Week =1995 amendment to the law= The Swiss federal Council modified the ordinance regulating the use of the \\"Swiss\\" name for watches in May 1995. This was said to bring the requirements of Swiss watchmaking industry a rubric like those of the European Union. In essence, the revision made it possible to affix indications of \\"Swiss made\\" on foreign watchcases and dials intended to equip Swiss watches. A watch is considered Swiss whose movement is Swiss, whose movement is encased in Switzerland and whose final control by the manufacturer takes place in Switzerland. Conversely, the Swiss manufacturers of parts destined for foreign watches from then on were authorized to visibly indicate that their products come from Switzerland. These innovations were intended to improve the transparency as regards the source of products. Consumers were expected to clearly recognize from what countries the various constituent parts of the watches came. However, the revisions were not intended to reduce the protection the name \\"Swiss made\\". Indeed, the high requirements which are imposed with a Swiss watch were said to remain unchanged.29 mars 1995 D√©partement F√©d√©ral de Justice et Police, Service d'information et de presse, Renseignements Suppl√©mentaires.http://www.admin.ch/cp/f/1995Mar30.181730.3998@idz.bfi.admin.ch.html Foreign components for \\"Swiss made\\" watches =Strengthening efforts= In 2007, the FH plans to seek political action on a proposal which introduces a new aspect to the definition of Swiss made, in the form of a value criterion. > Accordingly, any mechanical watch in which at least 80% of the production > cost is attributable to operations carried out in Switzerland would be > considered as a mechanical Swiss watch. For other watches, particularly > electronic watches, this rate would be 60%. Technical construction and > prototype development would moreover need to be carried out in Switzerland. > Raw materials, precious stones and the battery would be excluded from the > production cost. The Swiss movement in the existing ordinance already has a > value criterion, namely the rate of 50%. Considering that here, too, the > definition needs reinforcing, the draft amends these value criteria. For > mechanical movements therefore, the rate would be at least 80% of the value > of all constituent parts. For other movements, particularly electronic > movements, this rate would be 60%. Technical construction and prototype > development in Switzerland would also be a requirement in this case. The > draft also stipulates other provisions concerning the definition of Swiss > constituent parts and assembly in Switzerland. =Real-life economics= The minimum rate of 60% was not chosen at random: it corresponds to the rate used in the free-trade agreement between Switzerland and the European Union. In addition, with a rate of 80%, the FH proposes to lay particular emphasis on the mechanical watch. With these proposals, objectives in terms of protecting the Swiss made label should be attained. The proposed criteria also take into account the place of manufacture and the origin of components, thereby complying with the law on trademarks which serves as the legal basis of the \\"Swiss made\\" Ordinance. However, it will be up to the FH General Meeting to reach a final decision on the matter. Other products Underside of HAG model locomotive marked \\"Swiss made\\" A chocolate bar with a Swiss flag certifying its Swiss production. The Bio Suisse label certifies Swiss organic food products. The most popular items by far to have the \\"Swiss made\\" labels are Swiss watches. Almost all Swiss watchmakers, with the notable exception of Breitling, label their watches prominently on the dial. By convention, the words are fully capitalized, positioned on the bottom of the face, split by the half-hour indicator if available, curved along the bottom edge as necessary. Watches made in other countries typically indicate their country of origin on the back of the watch, except for very few well-known high-end manufacturers. Besides watchmakers, Swiss software companies are marking their software with the \\"swiss made\\" software label to declare the origin of their products. Principle In principle, the name \\"Switzerland,\\" as well as designations such as \\"Swiss\\", \\"Swiss quality\\", \\"Made in Switzerland\\", \\"Swiss made\\" or others containing the Swiss name, can only be used for products manufactured in Switzerland. This also applies to the translation of any of these terms into any other language. Conditions The conditions for using \\"Switzerland\\" or \\"Swiss\\" for products are defined very generally in the Trademark Law as follows: The origin of goods shall be determined by the place of manufacture or by the origin of the basic materials and components used. The Federal Council can specify such conditions if it is justified by general economic interests or by the interests of individual sectors.Protecting \\"Made in Switzerland\\" Report of the Federal Council, November 15, 2006. Controversy Up until today, this has only been done ‚Äì after a protracted debate concerning the highly controversial interests in the watch sector ‚Äì with the ‚ÄúSwiss-made‚Äù ordinance for watches (the Watch Ordinance). Besides this regulation, only a sparse number of court opinion on the topic can be found; in particular, the decision of the Commercial Court of St. Gallen according to which the value of the Swiss portion of the manufacturing costs including raw materials, sub- assemblies, accessory parts, salaries, and general manufacturing costs but excluding operating expenses, must be at least 50% and the \\"essential manufacturing process\\" which must have taken place in Switzerland. Essential manufacturing process Exactly how \\"essential manufacturing process\\" should be understood has been illustrated by the following two examples: =Swiss scarves= For a woven scarf to be considered a product of Swiss origin because of a particular coating it has received in Switzerland which stiffened the fabric (although this clearly is an important characteristic of the quality) is insufficient. In the eyes of the customer, the quality of the woven fabric is such an important characteristic of the product that fabric can only be indicated as being of Swiss origin if it was actually woven in Switzerland. =Swiss fountain pens= In fountain pens, the nib is an important element. But the quality of the fountain pen also primarily depends on the quality of the other parts. According to experience, more repairs are made on the holder than on the nibs for the fountain pens. For this reason, consumers pay attention not only to the quality of the nib but also to the quality of the holder (the feed system, the ink regulating system). That is why these parts of a fountain pen are not considered subsidiary parts. Thus, a fountain pen may not be marked as a Swiss product if only the nib has been manufactured in Switzerland. Swiss courts' interpretations of \\"Swiss made\\" The current legislation contains only very generally formulated conditions which must be met for using a ‚Äòmade in Switzerland‚Äô designation. With the exception of watches, no concrete criteria exist regarding when and by whom a 'made in Switzerland‚Äô designation can be affixed to a product and when it cannot. Appropriate criteria have only been developed by individual cantonal courts up until now. Products are, however, sold which are not 100% Swiss-manufactured. In such cases, the actual legal practice is based on the rules laid down in Article 48 of the Trademark Law and a 1968 ruling issued by the trade court of St. Gallen, reiterated in 1992.Schweizerische Juristen-Zeitung 1972, p. 207, and St. Gallische Gerichts-u. Verwaltungspraxis 1992, No. 39 These court rulings outline the conditions for the legal use of the designation ‚ÄúSwiss Made‚Äù and similar designations, especially for goods not manufactured in Switzerland in their entirety. In pertinent part the case law holds: > Products are considered Swiss products if they are fundamentally local > products or if they have been completely manufactured in Switzerland. In the > case of products that have been only partly manufactured in Switzerland, the > rule applies that the Swiss portion of the production cost (including basic > materials, semi-finished products, accessories, wages and production > overhead excluding distribution costs) must be at least 50%. However, this > 50% portion is not the sole criterion for determining the Swiss origin of a > product. The origin of the essential components and the manufacturing > process through which a product obtains its characteristic features, and ‚Äì > in borderline or doubtful cases ‚Äì the origin of the intellectual property > embodied in the product and the special circumstances in the respective > industry must also be taken into due consideration. Accordingly, there are two conditions that must be fulfilled for goods to be legally labelled as being of Swiss origin: * The Swiss portion of the production cost must be at least 50 percent (until 1 January 2017, then 60 percent). * The most important part of the manufacturing process must have taken place in Switzerland. The ‚Äúmost important part of the manufacturing process‚Äù is that part of the process that results in a completely new product. The determining factor here is that the original characteristics of the goods are lost through the manufacturing process, and the possible application of the goods is different from that of the basic materials of foreign origin used in their manufacture. In addition, the origin of goods is determined by the place where they are produced, not by where the idea for producing these goods was conceived. A product manufactured in Switzerland under a foreign license will still be Swiss in origin, while a product manufactured abroad using Swiss recipes or Swiss methods will still be foreign in origin.

The clothing used in the ancient world reflects the technologies that these peoples mastered. In many cultures, clothing indicated the social status of various members of society. The development of attire and fashion is an exclusively human characteristic and is a feature of most human societies. Clothing made of materials such as animal skins and vegetation was initially used by early humans to protect their bodies from the elements. The usage of clothing and textiles across the ages reflects the varying development of civilizations and technologies. Sources available for the study of clothing and textiles include material remains discovered via archaeology; representation of textiles and their manufacture in art; and documents concerning the manufacture, acquisition, use, and trade of fabrics, tools, and finished garments.  Ancient Egyptian clothing  Women entertainers perform at a celebration in Ancient Egypt; the dancers are naked and the musician wears a typical pleated garment as well as the cone of perfumed fat on top of her wig that melts slowly to emit its precious odors; both groups wear extensive jewelry, wigs, and cosmetics; neither wear shoes ‚Äì Tomb of Nebamun c. 1400 BC  Textile materials  Although aware of other materials, the ancient Egyptians most commonly used linen, a product made from the abundant flax plant. Due to a belief that animal based fabrics were impure, wool was rarely used and was forbidden in places like temples and sanctuaries. Other animal based products such as pelts were reserved for priests and eventually were adopted by only the highest class of ancient Egyptian citizenry. Linen is light, strong and flexible which made it ideal for life in the warm climate, where abrasion and heat would wear and tear at clothing. Thus, most ancient Egyptians used linen as their primary textile. The material quality of garments differed between the classes, where those of the upper class used finer linens, depicted in statues and paintings by their translucency. They also used more complex drapery, designs and patterns that included dyed threads and feathers. These materials were expensive and the wearer showed greater status by wearing them.Cassandra Vivian, Western Desert of Egypt: An Explorer's Handbook (New York: American University in Cairo Press, 2009) 321. On the other hand, cheaper and thicker linen was used within the lower class, where shorter garments were worn by the working class for better mobility in the fields.  Garments  Men in ancient Egypt often wore the loincloth (or schenti) common in all classes; although men of a higher class wore longer schenti, often pairing them with a draped cape or tunic. It was considered acceptable for men and women alike to bare their chests, in both upper and lower classes. A complete lack of clothing, however, was often associated with youth or poverty; it was common for children of all social classes to be unclothed up to the age of six, and for slaves to remain unclad for the majority of their lives. Certain clothing common to both genders included the tunic and the robe. Around 1425 to 1405 BC, a light tunic or short-sleeved shirt was popular, as well as a pleated skirt. Clothing for adult women remained unchanged over several millennia, save for small details. Draped clothes with very large rolls gave the impression of wearing several items. It was in fact a hawk, often of very fine muslin. The dress was rather narrow and even constricting, made of white or unbleached fabric for the lower classes. Garments worn by higher classes featured sleeves starting under the chest and were held up by suspenders tied onto the shoulders. These suspenders sometimes covered the breasts, other times passing between them, and were painted and colored for various reasons such as to imitate the plumage on the wings of Isis. The characteristic of the female garment in ancient Egypt Old Kingdom was a short skirt for the lower classes, or a kalasiris, a longer skirt reaching from the ankles to just below, or just above the breasts. By the Middle Kingdom, long kilts were a fashion. They were like skirts, reaching from waist to ankles, sometimes even hanging from the armpits. The New Kingdom was the more luxurious period; people wore more clothing, sometimes in layers. with an inner and an outer garment. This outer layer was made of particularly fine, diaphanous pleated linen, and would appear almost transparent. Clothing of the royal family was different, and was well documented; for instance the crowns of the Pharaohs as mentioned below, feather headdresses, and the khat or head cloth were all worn by nobility. Shoes were the same for both sexes; sandals braided with leather, or, particularly for the bureaucratic and priestly classes, papyrus.  Perfume and cosmetics  Embalming made it possible to develop cosmetic products and perfumery very early. Perfumes in Egypt were scented oils which were very expensive. In antiquity, people made great use of them. The Egyptians used make-up much more than anyone else at the time. Kohl, used as eyeliner, was eventually obtained as a substitute for galena or lead oxide which had been used for centuries. Eye paint was the most common form and was used to shield the eyes from the sun.The reason for them to wear eye makeup is to protect the eyes from the sun's rays and ward off infection. The dramatic makeup also imitated the facial markings of the sun god Horus, who was often depicted as a falcon. Eye shadow was made of crushed malachite and lipstick of ochre. Substances used in some of the cosmetics were toxic, and had adverse health effects with prolonged use. Beauty products were generally mixed with animal fats in order to make them more compact, more easily handled and to preserve them. Nails and hands were also painted with henna. Only the lower class had tattoos. It was also fashionable at parties for men and women to wear a perfumed cone on top of their heads. The cone was usually made of ox tallow and myrrh and as time passed, it melted and released a pleasant perfume. When the cone melted it was replaced with a new one (see the adjacent image with the musician and dancers). The use of cosmetics differed slightly between social classes, where more make-up was worn by higher class individuals as wealthier individuals could afford more make-up. Although there was no prominent difference between the cosmetics styles of the upper and lower class, noble women were known to pale their skin using creams and powders. This was due to pale skin being a sign of nobility as lighter skin meant less exposure to the sun whereas dark skin was associated with the lower class who tanned while taking part in menial labor such as working in the fields. This led to paler skin represented the non-working noble class, as noble woman would not work in the sun.  Wigs and headdresses  Queen Ahmose, Pharaoh Thutmose I, and daughter Neferubity ‚Äì note the youthful sidelock on the child and the royal attire and wigs on the adults Although heads were shaven as both as a sign of nobility and due to the hot climate, hairstyle was a huge part of ancient Egyptian fashion through the use of wigs. Wigs were used by both sexes of the upper and lower class; the quality of wigs depended on the amount of disposable income available, which created a visual rift between classes. Good quality wigs were made of human hair and were ornamented with jewels and woven with gold. In the court, the more elegant examples had small goblets at the top filled with perfume; Pharaohs even wore wig beards for certain special occasions. There is evidence of cheaper wigs made from wool and palm fibres, which were further substituted the woven gold used in its more expensive counterpart with beads and linen. The ancient Egyptians talent with substitution enabled wigs and headdresses to be worn by all social classes; for example. the nemes headdress, made from stiff linen and draped over the shoulders was reserved for the elite class to protect the wearer from the sun. On the other hand, headdresses such as the pschent were exclusive for the Pharaoh. Pharaohs also wore various crowns to identify different divinities, such as the horned crown of the goddess Hathor. In both social classes children were represented with one lock of hair remaining on the right side of their head (see the adjacent image). The most common headgear was the kaften, a striped fabric square worn by men.  Ornaments  Ornaments could be worn by all and was even woven into hair, resulting in wigs containing ornamental decorations. A peculiar ornament which the Egyptians created was gorgerin, an assembly of metal discs which rested on the chest skin or a short-sleeved shirt, and tied at the back. Some of the lower- class people of this time also created many different types of piercings and body decorations; some of which even included genital piercings, commonly found on female prostitutes of the time.  Jewellers  It was common for ancient Egyptians to be covered in jewellery because they believed it made them more attractive to the Gods. The upper class Egyptians were fascinated with gold jewelry. They believe that gold is the color of the sun, and it symbolises the sun's permanence and immortality, because this metal does not corrode or oxidize with time. Accessories were often embellished with inlaid precious and semi-precious stones such as emeralds, pearls, and lapis lazuli, to create intricate patterns inspired from nature. Common motifs included white lotuses, palm leaves, and even animals that represented the gods. Although the jewellery used by the lower class had similar motifs and designs, they were made with cheaper substitute materials. Copper was used in place of gold, and glazed glass or faience ‚Äì a mix of ground quartz and colorant ‚Äì to imitate precious stones. The most popular stones used were lapis lazuli, carnelian, and turquoise. Jewels were heavy and rather bulky, which would indicate an Asian influence. The lower classes wore small and simple glassware; bracelets also were heavy. They wore a large disk as a necklace of strength, sometimes described as an aegis. Gold was plentiful in Nubia and imported for jewelry and other decorative arts.  Ancient Minoan clothing  As elsewhere, Cretan clothes in the ancient times were well documented in their artwork where many items worn by priestesses and priests seem to reflect the clothing of most. Wool and flax were used. Spinning and weaving were domestic activities, using a similar technique to the Egyptians of the time,Bernice R. Jones - Ariadne‚Äôs Threads: The Construction and Significance of Clothes in the Aegean Bronze Age and dyeing was the only commercial process in keeping with everywhere else in antiquity. Fabrics were embroidered. Crimson was used the most in dyeing, in four different shades.  Female Minoan dress  Minoan Culture - their skirts would have begun at the waist, were flounced, and of many colorful patterns Early in the culture, the loincloth was used by both sexes. The women of Crete wore the garment more as an underskirt than the men, by lengthening it. They are often illustrated in statuettes with a large dagger fixed at the belt. The provision of items intended to secure personal safety was undoubtedly one of the characteristics of female clothing in the Neolithic era, traces of the practice having been found in the peat bogs of Denmark up to the Bronze Age. Cretan women's clothing included the first sewn garments known to history. Dresses were long and low-necked, with the bodice being open almost all the way to the waist, leaving the breasts exposed. Dresses were often accompanied by the Minoan corset, an early form of corset created as a close fitting blouse, designed to narrow the waist, as a narrow waist was prized in Minoan culture. The belt, also kept tight, and used to narrow the waist before the corset, a long or short coat, or a hat were used to supplement the female outfit. Ancient brooches, widespread in the Mediterranean, were used throughout the period.  Male Minoan dress  The loincloth worn by both men and women of Crete is shown in this fresco of a religious event where the women are light-skinned and the man is deeply tanned. Practically all men wore a loincloth. Unlike the Egyptians, the shanti varied according to its cut and normally was arranged as a short skirt or apron, ending in a point sticking out similar to a tail. The fabric passed between the legs, adjusted with a belt, and almost certainly, was decorated with metal. It was worn by all men in society, as well as a standalone garment for women during more athletic activities, such as bull- leaping. In addition to Cretan styles, Cycladic clothing was worn as pants across the continent. A triangular front released the top of the thighs. One could say it was clothing of an athletic population, because of this and the fact that the chest always was naked. It was sometimes covered with a cask, probably ritualistically. However, long clothing was worn for protection against bad weather and eventually a coat of wool was used by the Greeks. Men had long hair flowing to the shoulders; however several types of headgear were usual, types of bonnets and turbans, probably of skin. Shoes were boots of skin, probably of chamois, and were used only to leave the house, where one went barefoot, just as in the sanctuaries and the palaces. People studying this matter have noticed the outdoor staircases are worn down considerably, interior ones hardly at all. It's known that later, entering a house - this habit already was in use in Crete. The boots had a slightly raised end, thus indicating an Anatolian origin, similar to those found on the frescoes of Etruria. Ancient Israelite clothing  In a rare depiction of Israelite clothing, King Jehu, or possibly his ambassador, kneels at the feet of Shalmaneser III on the Black Obelisk. Israelite manUndergarments= The earliest and most basic garment was the ezor ( ) or ·∏•agor ( ), an apron around the hips or loins, that in primitive times was made from the skins of animals. It was a simple piece of cloth worn in various modifications, but always worn next to the skin. Garments were held together by a belt or girdle, also called an ezor or ·∏•agor. The ezor later became displaced among the Hebrews by the kuttoneth ( ). an under-tunic. The kuttoneth appears in Assyrian art as a tight-fitting undergarment, sometimes reaching only to the knee, sometimes to the ankle. The kuttoneth corresponds to the undergarment of the modern Middle Eastern agricultural laborers: a rough cotton tunic with loose sleeves and open at the breast. Anyone dressed only in the kuttoneth was considered naked. =Outer garments= ;simla The simla ( )Biblestudytools.com Hebrew lexicon: simlah; The Hebrew lexicon is Brown, Driver, Briggs, Gesenius Lexicon. See also salmah. was the heavy outer garment or shawl of various forms. It consisted of a large rectangular piece of rough, heavy woolen material, crudely sewn together so that the front was unstitched and with two openings left for the arms. Flax is another possible material. In the day it was protection from rain and cold, and at night peasant Israelites could wrap themselves in this garment for warmth (see ). The front of the simla also could be arranged in wide folds (see ) and all kinds of products could be carried in it (See , ). Every respectable man generally wore the simla over the kuttoneth (See ), but since the simla hindered work, it was either left home or removed when working. (See ). From this simple item of the common people developed the richly ornamented mantle of the well-off, which reached from the neck to the knees and had short sleeves. ;me'il The me'il ( ) or cloak was generally worn over the undergarment, (See , ). The me'il was a costly wrap (See , , , ) and, according to the description of the priest's me'il, was similar to the sleeveless abaya (). This, like the me'il of the high priest, may have reached only to the knees, but it is commonly supposed to have been a long-sleeved garment made of a light fabric, probably imported from Syria. =Religious wear= The Torah commands that Israelites wear tassels or fringes (·∫ìi·∫ìit, Biblestudytools.com Hebrew lexicon: ·∫ìi·∫ìit; The Hebrew lexicon is Brown, Driver, Briggs, Gesenius Lexicon or gedilim, ) attached to the corners of garments (see , ). Phylacteries or tefillin (Hebrew: ◊™÷∞◊§÷¥◊ú÷¥÷º◊ô◊ü) are in use by New Testament times (see ). Tefillin are boxes containing biblical verses that are attached to the forehead and arm by leather straps.Tefillin, \\"The Book of Jewish Knowledge\\", Nathan Ausubel, Crown Publishers, NY, 1964, p.458 =Headwear= Depictions show some Hebrews and Syrians bareheaded or wearing merely a band to hold the hair together. Hebrew peasants undoubtedly also wore head coverings similar to the modern keffiyeh, a large square piece of woolen cloth folded diagonally in half into a triangle. The fold is worn across the forehead, with the keffiyeh loosely draped around the back and shoulders, often held in place by a cord circlet. Men and women of the upper classes wore a kind of turban, cloth wound about the head. The shape varied greatly. =Footwear= Sandals (na'alayim) of leather were worn to protect the feet from burning sand and dampness. Sandals might also be of wood, with leather straps (, ). Sandals were not worn in the house nor in the sanctuary (see , ). Israelite women A woman's garments mostly corresponded to those of men: they wore simla and kuttoneth. Women's garments evidently differed too from that of men (see ). Women's garments were probably longer (compare , , , ), had sleeves (), presumably were brighter colors and more ornamented, and may also have been of finer material. Israelite women used to wear veils in public, which distinguished them from women in pagan ancient societies. Even as the custom of veiling dwindled among other ancient societies Israelite females retained it for religious identification. Shawls, dictated by Jewish piety, and other forms of head coverings were also worn by ancient Israelite women in towns such as Jerusalem.  Ancient Greek clothing  Statues at the \\"House of Cleopatra\\" in Delos, Greece. Man and woman wearing the himation Ancient Greece is famous for its philosophy, art, literature, and politics. As a result, classical period Greek style in dress often has been revived when later societies wished to evoke some revered aspect of ancient Greek civilization, such as democratic government. A Greek style in dress became fashionable in France shortly after the French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799), because the style was thought to express the democratic ideals for which that revolution was fought, no matter how incorrect the understanding of the historical reality was. Clothing reformers later in the 19th century AD admired ancient Greek dress because they thought it represented timeless beauty, the opposite of complicated and rapidly changing fashions of their time, as well as the more practical reasoning that Grecian-style dresses required far less cloth than those of the Rococo period. Clothing in ancient Greece primarily consisted of the chiton, peplos, himation, and chlamys. While no clothes have survived from this period, descriptions exist from contemporary accounts and artistic depiction. Clothes were mainly homemade, and often served many purposes (such as bedding). Despite popular imagination and media depictions of all-white clothing, elaborate design and bright colors were favored. Ancient Greek clothing consisted of lengths of linen or wool fabric, which generally was rectangular. Clothes were secured with ornamental clasps or pins (, per√≥nƒì; cf. fibula), and a belt, sash, or girdle (zone) might secure the waist. ;Peplos, Chitons The inner tunic was a peplos or chiton. The peplos was a worn by women. It was usually a heavier woollen garment, more distinctively Greek, with its shoulder clasps. The upper part of the peplos was folded down to the waist to form an apoptygma. The chiton was a simple tunic garment of lighter linen, worn by both genders and all ages. Men's chitons hung to the knees, whereas women's chitons fell to their ankles. Often the chiton is shown as pleated. Either garment could be pulled up under the belt to blouse the fabric: kolpos. ;Strophion, Epiblema, Veil A strophion was an undergarment sometimes worn by women around the mid-portion of the body, and a shawl (epiblema) could be draped over the tunic. Women dressed similarly in most areas of ancient Greece although in some regions, they also wore a loose veil as well at public events and market. ;Chlamys The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of woolen material worn by men as a cloak; it was about the size of a blanket, usually bordered. The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to 3rd century BC. As worn by soldiers, it could be wrapped around the arm and used as a light shield in combat. ;Himation The basic outer garment during winter was the himation, a larger cloak worn over the peplos or chlamys. The himation has been most influential perhaps on later fashion. ;Athletics and nudity During Classical times in Greece, male nudity received a religious sanction following profound changes in the culture. After that time, male athletes participated in ritualized athletic competitions such as the classical version of the ancient Olympic Games, in the nude as women became barred from the competition except as the owners of racing chariots. Their ancient events were discontinued, one of which (a footrace for women) had been the sole original competition. Myths relate that after this prohibition, a woman was discovered to have won the competition while wearing the clothing of a man--instituting the policy of nudity among the competitors that prevented such embarrassment again. Ancient Roman and Italic clothing Etruscan dancers in the Tomb of the Triclinium near Tarquinia, Italy (470 BC) The clothing of ancient Italy, like that of ancient Greece, is well known from art, literature & archaeology. Although aspects of Roman clothing have had an enormous appeal to the Western imagination, the dress and customs of the Etruscan civilization that inhabited Italy before the Romans are less well imitated (see the adjacent image), but the resemblance in their clothing may be noted. The Etruscan culture is dated from 1200 BC through the first two phases of the Roman periods. At its maximum extent during the foundation period of Rome and the Roman kingdom, it flourished in three confederacies of cities: of Etruria, of the Po valley with the eastern Alps, and of Latium and Campania. Rome was sited in Etruscan territory. There is considerable evidence that early Rome was dominated by Etruscans until the Romans sacked Veii in 396 BC. In ancient Rome, boys after the age of sixteen had their clothes burned as a sign of growing up.Steele,Philip. \\"Clothes and Crafts in Roman Times\\". Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2000, p. 20 Roman girls also wore white until they were married to say they were pure and virginal.Steele,Philip. \\"Clothes and Crafts in Roman Times\\". Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2000, p. 23  Toga and tunics  The tunic was adapted into many styles and was the basic garment of adults in ancient Rome after the 2nd century BC Probably the most significant item in the ancient Roman wardrobe was the toga, a one-piece woolen garment that draped loosely around the shoulders and down the body. Togas could be wrapped in different ways, and they became larger and more voluminous over the centuries. Some innovations were purely fashionable. Because it was not easy to wear a toga without tripping over it or trailing drapery, some variations in wrapping served a practical function. Other styles were required, for instance, for covering the head during ceremonies. Historians believe that originally the toga was worn by all Romans during the combined centuries of the Roman monarchy and its successor, the Roman Republic. At this time it is thought that the toga was worn without undergarments. Free citizens were required to wear togas. because only slaves and children wore tunics.Steele,Philip. \\"Clothes and Crafts in Roman Times\\". Gareth Stevens Publishing, 2000, p. 21 By the 2nd century BC, however, it was worn over a tunic, and the tunic became the basic item of dress for both men and women. Women wore an outer garment known as a stola, which was a long pleated dress similar to the Greek chitons. Although togas are now thought of as the only clothing worn in ancient Italy, in fact, many other styles of clothing were worn and also are familiar in images seen in artwork from the period. Garments could be quite specialized, for instance, for warfare, specific occupations, or for sports. In ancient Rome women athletes wore leather briefs and brassiere for maximum coverage but the ability to compete. Girls and boys under the age of puberty sometimes wore a special kind of toga with a reddish- purple band on the lower edge, called the toga praetexta. This toga also was worn by magistrates and high priests as an indication of their status. The toga candida, an especially whitened toga, was worn by political candidates. Prostitutes wore the toga muliebris, rather than the tunics worn by most women. The toga pulla was dark-colored and worn for mourning, while the toga purpurea, of purple-dyed wool, was worn in times of triumph and by the Roman emperor. After the transition of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire in c. 44 BC, only men who were citizens of Rome wore the toga. Women, slaves, foreigners, and others who were not citizens of Rome wore tunics and were forbidden from wearing the toga. By the same token, Roman citizens were required to wear the toga when conducting official business. Over time, the toga evolved from a national to a ceremonial costume. Different types of togas indicated age, profession, and social rank. Roman writer Seneca criticized men who wore their togas too loosely or carelessly. He also criticized men who wore what were considered feminine or outrageous styles, including togas that were slightly transparent. The late toga of adult citizens, the toga virilis, was made of plain white wool and worn after the age of fourteen. A woman convicted of adultery might be forced to wear a toga as a badge of shame and curiously, as a symbol of the loss of her female identity. The ancient Romans were aware that their clothing differed from that of other peoples. In particular, they noted the long trousers worn by people they considered barbarians from the north, including the Germanic Franks and Goths. The figures depicted on ancient Roman armored breastplates often include barbarian warriors in shirts and trousers.

Roman armour, particularly the muscle cuirass, has symbolized amazing power. In Europe during the Renaissance (15th and 16th centuries AD), painters and sculptors sometimes depicted rulers wearing pseudo-Roman military attire, including the cuirass, military cloak, and sandals. Later, during the French Revolution, an effort was made to dress officials in uniforms based on the Roman toga, to symbolize the importance of citizenship to a republic. Adopted by the rank and file revolutionaries, the 18th-century AD liberty cap, a brimless, limp cap fitting snugly around the head, was based on a bonnet worn by freed slaves in ancient Rome, the Phrygian cap. The modern Western bride also has inherited elements from ancient Roman wedding attire, such as the bridal veil and the wedding ring. Ancient Indian clothing  Evidence of ancient Indian clothing can be found in figurines, rock cut sculptures, cave paintings, and human art forms found in temples and monuments. These sculptures show human figures wearing clothes wrapped around the body, such as sari, turbans and dhoti. Upper classes of the society wore fine muslin and imported silk fabrics while the common classes wore locally made fabrics such as cotton, flax, wool, linen, and leather. India was the one of the first places where cotton was cultivated and used as early as 2500 BC during the Harappan Era (3300‚Äì1300 BC). Recent analysis of Harappan silk fibers in beads have shown that silk was made by the process of reeling, an art known only to China until the early centuries AD. The only evidence found for clothing is from iconography and some unearthed Harappan figurines which are usually unclothed. These little depictions show that usually men wore a long cloth wrapped over their waist and fastened it at the back (just like a close clinging dhoti). Turbans were worn, and a long robe over the left shoulder was worn by those of high social rank. The normal attire of the women at that time was a very scanty skirt up to knee length leaving the waist bare, and cotton head dresses. Jewellery was very popular, and men wore their hair in various styles with trimmed beards. Vedic period (c. 1750 ‚Äì 500 BC) garments for both sexes included a single cloth wrapped around the whole body and draped over the shoulder. A lower garment called paridhana was pleated in front and tied with a belt (mekhala), and worn with a shawl-like upper garment called uttariya. Orthodox males and females usually wore the uttariya by throwing it over the left shoulder only, in the style called upavita. The lower garment was called 'nivi' or 'nivi bandha', while the upper body was mostly left bare. In cold weather a garment called pravara was worn. Sometimes the poor people wore the lower garment as a loincloth, while the rich wore foot-length pravara to show their prestige. Vedic women mainly wore the sari, which is derived from ‡§∂‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä, the Sanskrit for 'strip of cloth' . Towards the later Vedic period, the choli and dupatta, a smaller version of sari, were introduced. The dupatta was worn with ghaghara (an ankle-length skirt). Vedic men wore lungi (a garment like a sarong and dhoti, a single cloth wrapped around the waist and legs which is still traditionally worn by men in villages. Wool, linen, silk and cotton were the main fibers used for making clothes, with woven stripes and checks. Gold jewellery remained very popular. Evidence of clothing worn during the Maurya Empire (322‚Äì185 BC) comes from statues of yakshini, the female epitome of fertility. The most common attire of the people at that time was a lower garment called antariya, generally made of cotton, linen or muslin and decorated with gems, and fastened in a looped knot at the centre of the waist. A cloth was covered in lehenga style around the hips to form a tubular skirt. Another embellished long piece of cloth, hanging at the front and wrapped around the waist, was called patka. Mauryan Empire ladies often wore an embroidered fabric waistband with drum headed knots at the ends. As an upper garment, people's main garb was uttariya, a long scarf worn in several ways.

Hiralal pretends to be a friend, and takes care of her like a father. He brings his poor nephew Sanjay (Kabir Bedi) from abroad, who is also the lover of Aarti's best friend Nandini (Sonu Walia). Although Nandini loves Aarti, she is intensely in love with Sanjay, and after he requests her to help him, she finally agrees to help him rob Aarti of her wealth. Slowly, Sanjay gets close to Aarti's children. Nandini and the rest of the family convince Aarti to marry Sanjay and finally, she marries him. The day after the wedding, Aarti, Sanjay and Nandini go on a short trip, in which Sanjay pushes Aarti from the rowboat into crocodile-infested waters, so that she dies, and he inherits her wealth. The crocodile mauls Aarti and mutilates her body and face. However, Aarti's body is not found and Sanjay cannot inherit the legacy until her body is found and her death is established beyond any doubt. As a result, the family is in a serious situation. Sanjay, out of frustration becomes abusive to the children and Aarti's pets. While all of this is occurring, Aarti is found adrift by an old farmer, who rescues her. A few months later, the horribly disfigured Aarti decides to return to her city and avenge herself and her family. She exchanges her expensive diamond earrings for a huge amount of money, using the money to pay for extensive plastic surgery, and becomes a stunningly beautiful woman, very different from her earlier self. Aarti sets her first target Nandini who is the most successful model in town. In order to beat her popularity, she participates as a model in the same modelling agency (Kraft advertising agency) which made Nandini a star. Aarti Introduces herself as 'Jyoti'. The photographer JD (Shatrughan Sinha) spots her beauty and vows to make her the topmost model in the town even more successful than Nandini. Soon Jyoti's popularity takes over Nandini and out of frustration, she challenges Jyoti for a dance performance in which she loses. Nandini soon becomes jobless and Jyoti's first target gets settled. Meanwhile, Sanjay gets smitten by Jyoti's beauty and is no longer interested in Nandini. He tries various ways to woo her and seduce her but fails every time. Later Jyoti finds out that her children have stopped going to school. Jyoti lures in Sanjay to invite her to her own home where she lived with her pets and children. Although the pets recognize Jyoti as Aarti, the children fail to do so. Jyoti finds out about all misdeeds of Sanjay and Hiralal through the children including the murder of Ramu Kaka, the servant (A K Hangal) and her father. JD gets suspicious about Jyoti's actions and shows his concern for her. He offers help as a friend which Jyoti declines. JD ultimately finds out that Jyoti is none other than Aarti who has come back to exact revenge on her wrong doers. Meanwhile, Jyoti sets her second target, her uncle Hiralal, sneaks into his house at midnight and kills him. She then calls Nandini and tells her that she is taking Sanjay with him at Sitapur farm (the same place where Aarti was attacked). JD asks Aarti's children to tell about Jyoti's whereabouts as her life is in danger. He reveals them the secret about Jyoti being their mother. Sanjay brings Jyoti to the farmhouse. Nandini also reaches there and confronts Sanjay. She threatens to expose him to Jyoti and will not let her suffer like Aarti. Jyoti confronts them both and finally reveals herself as Aarti. Aarti vows to take revenge from Sanjay in the similar fashion the way he tried to kill her. Aarti fights Sanjay and in the process, Nandini sacrifices herself to save Aarti. Aarti with the help of her pet horse Raja, drags Sanjay to the same spot with Crocodile infested waters. Aarti tries her best to knock Sanjay off the cliff but Sanjay turns around and pushes her down. JD reaches the spot, saves Aarti and fights Sanjay. After a brief fight, he knocks Sanjay out and he rolls down the cliff, hanging upside down. He asks Aarti for forgiveness. Aarti recalls that horrific incident when she was pushed into the lake and brutally attacked by the crocodile. Aarti knocks Sanjay one last time with a wooden rod and he falls down the cliff and gets devoured by the crocodile. Aarti reunites with her family and pets.

Originally formed just before the World War I as the Minsk Military District out of the remnants of the Vilno Military District and the Warsaw Military District, it was headed by the Russian General Eugen Alexander Ernst Rausch von Traubenberg. With the outbreak of the Russian Civil War it was reorganized into the Western Front and in April 1924 it was renamed to the Western Military District. In October 1926 it was redesignated the Belorussian Military District, with its staff in Smolensk. And in July 1940 it was renamed the Western Special Military District. It covered the territory of the Byelorussian SSR and the western part of the RSFSR (including Smolensk area, Bryansk area, and parts of Kaluga area). History In 1928, the first maneuvers of troops of the district were held, which was attended by 6th Cavalry Division and 7th Cavalry Division, 5th, 8th and 27th Rifle Divisions, 33rd territorial division, a tank brigade of the Moscow Military District, artillery, aviation, communication, and engineering units. The exercises showed growth in the combat skills of troops, which attended the People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs, Kliment Voroshilov. In 1932 it deployed from within the country the 4th Leningrad Cavalry Order of the Red Banner Voroshilov Division commanded by Georgy Zhukov. In 1932‚Äì1933, in connection with the development of armored vehicles, it formed seven separate tank brigades, armed with Soviet-made tanks: light T-24, T-26, medium T-28, fast BT-2, BT-5, floating T-37, heavy T-35, T-27 tankettes. In 1937 the district deployed 15 infantry divisions, grouped into five infantry corps and five cavalry divisions. On 26 July 1938, the district was renamed the Belarussian Special Military District (). After the Soviet/German invasion of Poland in September 1939, it took in most of the former Polish area and was redesignated the Belorussian Special Military District. In July 1940, it was redesignated the Western Special Military District. When the German invasion, Operation Barbarossa, began on 22 June 1941 the district was again redesignated the Western Front. The district was reformed in October 1943 from the staff of the Moscow Zone of Defense (at Smolensk, which moved to Minsk in August 1944). From December 1944 until July 1945, the district was designated Byelorussian-Lithuanian Military District (covering the territory of Belarus and Lithuania), and from 9 July until 26 January 1946 it was divided in two districts ‚Äì Minsk District (from the staff of the 3rd Army), and Baranovichi District (from the staff of 3rd Belorussian Front with its headquarters staff at Bobruisk). The district covered the territory of the Byelorussian SSR. From mid February 1949, in accordance with a directive issued 10 January 1949, the 1st Air Army, present within the district, was redesignated the 26th Air Army. The 26th Air Army was subordinate to the BVO. In 1962 the 26th Air Army comprised the 95th Fighter Aviation Division (Shchuchin, Grodno Oblast), the 1st Guards Fighter-Bomber Aviation Division (Lida, Grodno Oblast), and three separate smaller units: the 10th independent Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment (Shchuchin, Grodno Oblast), the 248th independent Mixed Aviation Squadron (Minsk-Lipki, Minsk Oblast), and the 95th independent Mixed Aviation Squadron (Grodno, Grodno Oblast).Holm, forces/armies/26VA.htm 26th Air Army, accessed September 2011 In April 1980 the 26th Air Army was renamed the VVS Belorussian Military District.

On the dissolution of the Soviet Union the 28th Army, headquartered at Grodno, included the 6th Guards Tank Division (Grodno), 28th Tank Division (Slonim), 50th Guards Motor Rifle Division (Brest), and the 76th Tank Division (possibly a Category 'V'Feskov et al. 2004 cadre formation), also at Brest. The 120th 'Rogachev' Guards Motorised Rifle Division, subordinated directly to district control, was the district's most prestigious division. Also present was the 51st Guards Artillery Division. Air defence was provided in the 1980s by the 2nd Air Defence Army of the Soviet Air Defence Forces (PVO) which included 11th and 28th PVO Corps. The forces of the district became the basis of the Armed Forces of Belarus after the district was disbanded in May 1992 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. > \\"The Byelorusian Military District is no more.

The basis for the formation of the division were components of the Moscow Air Defence Corps, relocated to Kuybyshev. In September 1944, during the completion of Operation Bagration, the division, reorganized into the 14th Air Defense Corps, moved forward to Minsk to organize air defense of the territory liberated by the 3rd Belorussian Front. The corps defended airfields, railway junctions and the cities of Minsk, Borisov, Lida, Molodechno. In July 1944 the corps units, in cooperation with fighter aviation, shot down 19 enemy aircraft. The 927th Fighter Aviation Regiment (927 IAP), located at Loshitsa airfield particularly distinguished itself. The regiment was commanded by Hero of the Soviet Union, Lieutenant-Colonel N. Kozlov (later major-general of aviation, deputy commander of the 2nd independent Air Defence Army).See http://www.ww2.dk/new/air%20force/regiment/iap/927iap.htm, accessed September 2020. After the end of the Great Patriotic War, the corps was reorganized into the Belorussian Air Defense District (1951), then to the Minsk Air Defense Corps (1954). In 1988 the 2nd independent Army of the Air Defence Forces (Russian: 2-—è –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è –∞—Ä–º–∏—è –ü–í–û) comprised the 11th and 28th Air Defence Corps.

The club originated in the United Kingdom and is still headquartered there but has members all over the world. Membership is by invitation only and is limited to 500 worldwide. Invitees must demonstrate the ability to send and receive morse code at a minimum of 25 words per minute, demonstrate regular activity on the amateur frequency bands, and show impeccable levels of courtesy on the air. Many FOC members are prominent in the world of DXpeditions and amateur radio contesting, or are known for their skill in chasing DX. Many, too, are interested in having long conversations using morse code, often at high speed. The Club has an active social programme and many members engage in extensive travel to meet other members in person. References *FOC Official Website This article has been written by Bob for publication in the RSGB‚Äôs RadCom magazine, on the FOCUS 76 and a shorter version for ARRL‚Äôs QST, to publicise the 70th anniversary of FOC and to recognise G8PG‚Äôs 70 years of continual membership of FOC. Gus is FOC number 11 and is the only one of the original members of FOC when it was formed in 1938, still with us. The First Class CW Operators‚Äô Club (FOC) and one of its founders, Gus Taylor, G8PG, celebrate the organisation‚Äôs 70th anniversary this year. Bob Jones, G3YIQ, takes a look at how the club has developed since 1938 and what it means to be a member today.  The Early Days  Bob Webster, G5BW, and John Hunter, G2QZ, founded FOC in 1938. Only British members were permitted during the early years of FOC. Membership grew to 70 members by the outbreak of World War II, when all activities were suspended. Both of the young founders died during the war - Bob from tuberculosis and John from pneumonia. The club was re-formed in 1946 by Captain A.M.H. Fergus (Fergie), G2ZC. It was opened to an international membership and by the end of 1950 had over 300 members in 31 countries. The main requirements for membership were the ability to send and receive Morse code at 18 WPM and sponsorship from three existing members. Doug Borden, W1BUX, became the first US member in 1947. One of the earliest notes on FOC‚Äôs function states that: ‚ÄúThe First Class Operators‚Äô Club came into existence with the avowed object to taking into membership any amateur transmitter who, by virtue of his ability as a telegraphist and his general attitude to amateur radio, appeared worthy to belong to an organisation the aims of which were to encourage good operating and proper use of our bands.\\" A small committee was responsible for identifying suitable members and inviting them to join. Although ability as a telegraphist was the key requirement for membership, FOC was not originally devoted exclusively to CW, although it was always understood that the primary interest of members would be CW. It was not until 1967 that the name of the club was changed to \\"The First Class CW Operators‚Äô Club\\", and so it remains.  Fraternity, not Elitism  From its earliest days, some people have misunderstood FOC‚Äôs purpose and culture. In March 1939, a letter to the RSGB‚Äôs T&R; Bulletin, an early forerunner of RadCom, accused FOC members of offering, ‚Äúunwanted and unauthoritative advice to experimental operators\\". The club was seen as a bunch of elitist operators who considered themselves a cut above the rest. This same criticism has been levelled from time-to-time throughout the club‚Äôs history, perhaps engendered in part simply by the name of the organisation. Such a criticism could not be further from the truth. Of course, there is pride in becoming a member of a club that still has a limited membership of 500 radio amateurs worldwide, and one that requires a demonstrable standard of skill and commitment to become a member. However, the welcoming letter to new members states very prominently: ‚ÄúFOC is an organisation that promotes first class operating rather than a body that recognises first class operators\\". FOC members fully realise that there are many, first class operators that may never become members of the club, either through lack of interest in club membership per se, or simply because their operating preferences are much narrower that those catered for by FOC. For example, those that only operate in contests are not going to find the club of interest. In 1965, one member wrote: ‚ÄúFOC is more than a club; it is a way of life, a camaraderie. It is an organised effort to demonstrate that which is good for all by example. FOC means more than a clean CW operator capable of transmitting 60 WPM in Old-English characters with a six inch brush. FOC means a clean signal, willingness to QRS to 3 WPM for the struggling beginner, a helping hand for the aspirant down the street, a feeling of oneness with all who would like to see the level of amateur radio rise. FOC is not an award, it is a goal\\". However, not all hams agree. Even to the present day, many hams describe the FOC as elitist, exclusivist, and contradictory to the inclusive traditions of the hobby. They point out that FOC originated in England within a few years of the origin of Mensa, a group that excludes all but those in the top percentiles of I.Q. scores. These groups appeared in the years after WW I and WW II when the British class system based upon birth alone, was being questioned, if somewhat obliquely, by the emergence of groups that distinguished themselves on the basis of merit or performance in a single narrow area.  Notable Members  At the time of writing, there have been nearly 2000 members since the club was formed and, as mentioned earlier, membership is limited to approximately 500 stations. Limits were originally set because of the sheer workload for the club secretary in regularly communicating with members. In practice, the normal membership level has been around 490 in recent years and the club is always striving to attract new, active members, so the limit has been no hindrance to the introduction of new members. Amongst the past and present membership are many of the world‚Äôs top DX stations and contesters. Hardly a major DXpedition goes by without the involvement of FOC members. For example, the 20-man strong 3B7C team included no less than seven FOC members from three countries. Some members have been notable for their achievements in other fields. Austin Forsyth, G6FO, editor of Short Wave Magazine, was member number one after WW II. Louis Varney, G5RV, was number seven.  Gus Taylor G8PG  Gus Taylor, G8PG, who lives in West Kirby on the Wirrall, UK, was a founder member of FOC in 1938. He is one of the leading lights in the G-QRP Club and a founder member of the Royal Signals Amateur Radio Society (RSARS). Friends describe him as ‚Äúpersistent and dogged\\" in his enthusiasm for promoting low power communications. Gus learned Morse code in preparation for going to sea in the Merchant Navy. He worked on a weather ship in WW II, where his competence in sending and receiving code by both radio signals and light was finely honed. Gus, now 93 years old, wrote a regular feature in the G- QRP Club‚Äôs newsletter, SPRAT, for over 15 years, until last year. It was entitled Antennas, Anecdotes and Awards. He developed many QRP radios over the years and is something of an expert on antennas and tuners. However, one of his most important contributions to the world of CW was a Morse practice tape that he produced in the last 1970s - hundreds of copies of which were distributed over a period of several years. Gus exemplifies the FOC ethic - a love of CW, a commitment to help others achieve the highest operating standards and a desire to create lasting friendships with those who share a common interest in amateur radio.  Bill Windle G8VG  Although many members have made huge contributions to the running of FOC over the years and continue to do so today, perhaps the most notable was the late Bill Windle, G8VG. Bill, member number six when the club was re-formed in 1946, was FOC Chairman from 1951 to 1968 and again from 1981 until 1983. He was also President in 1962 and both Secretary and News Sheet Editor from 1967 until 1981. During his tenure of these various FOC posts, he was instrumental in driving the club forward and in encouraging more activity and participation in events. He helped to make FOC the international organisation it is today, visiting the United States twice and making countless friends on both sides of the Atlantic through his FOC work. Bill died on 7 December 1983, but his callsign is still on the air today. G8VG is now operated by his son, Pete, also an FOC member. Bill is constantly remembered in the club through the Bill Windle Memorial Award and the Bill Windle QSO Parties. The Award is made to the member having obtained the highest number of points for working members once on a different band each month. Each qualifying QSO is even called a ‚ÄòWindle‚Äô and the competition runs every calendar year. The QSO Parties, two of which were scheduled in 2008, are open to members and non-members alike. Their main aim is to generate CW activity and have fun!  Al Slater G3FXB  Bill Windle's dedication to FOC was never recognized, nor appreciated more, than by Al Slater - G3FXB. Al saw \\"The Old Man\\" begin to weaken and stumble long before his demise. He seamlessly assumed the mammoth responsibilities of keeping the organization running, and no doubt reassured Bill that it would continue to thrive. The Club sponsors an annual award in Al's memory (SK - 1982) that is earned by an exceptional contribution to Ham Radio, which best exemplifies G3FXB's demeanor. Al's style was truly unique. He was a well-known Contester and DXer. FOC gained prestige from his association, rather than vice versa. Al had already given a quarter-century of service to the Club, having joined in 1950, and becoming President in 1970. He later served as Secretary, and then Chairman until his untimely demise in 1992. It was Al's enthusiasm that popularized the Club and inspired so many others to contribute their skills.  FOC Today  Today, UK membership represents just 21% of the worldwide membership of 483. North American members dominate, representing some 45% of the membership. Continental European countries make up 21% and the rest of the world accounts for the final 8%. There are members in 43 countries. The longest-standing North American member is K2TT, Bill Schneider. The club HQ remains in the UK and an eight-member committee runs the organisation. As stated in its original aims, the club is all about promoting high standards of CW operating and an extensive on-air events programme reflects this. There are numerous operating awards made each year and during the first weekend of February the FOC Marathon takes place. During this 48-hour members-only contest, stations try to QSO each other on different bands and the competition includes open, restricted and QRP sections to cater for all types of operation.  Activities and Contests  The Bill Windle QSO Party, mentioned earlier, encourages contacts with other FOC members and non-members, but in a more relaxed fashion where a ragchew with old friends is all part of the fun. In addition, activity days are run throughout the year, typically two per month, during which members are encouraged to take to the air. The social side of FOC is very active too. The 2008 Annual Dinner at the Royal George Hotel in Birdlip, Gloucestershire, in October saw changes to the committee and the inauguration of a new President, Colin Turner, G3VTT, who took the helm from Ian Trusson, G3RVM. Other dinners include events in Harrogate, Friedrichshafen (Germany), and three in the USA: Florida, Louisiana/Texas, and Visalia on the West coast. There is a traditional breakfast at Dayton. FOC also sends all its members a monthly News Sheet, either on-line as a PDF document or via mail. There is also a quarterly magazine, printed in full colour and edited by Gabor (S57WJ) called FOCUS, which contains a lot of interesting articles by members.  Is FOC For You?  If you are focused entirely on chasing DX, or contesting, then FOC is probably not the club for you. However, if you have a genuine love of CW and enjoy socialising with others of like interest, then FOC could be just right for you. It takes some work to join - it‚Äôs not simply a matter of filling in a form and sending off a cheque. Firstly, someone has to nominate you - based on their experience of working you on at least two bands within the last year. The station you are working may ask you about your possible interest in joining the club, or your nomination may come out of the blue when a letter arrives from George Eddowes, G3NOH, the Membership Secretary. Upon accepting the nomination you are then added to the ‚ÄòAdditional Nominations‚Äô List, which means that all FOC members know you are seeking further sponsorship. You then have to find a further four sponsors within six months of nomination. Sponsors must come from at least two continents, with no more than three from any one continent, and at least one must be from the UK. All sponsors must have a QSO with you on at least two bands in order to be able to support your nomination. In recent years, just over half of those nominated have gone on to attain membership. Actively requesting nomination or sponsorship is frowned upon, but if you are active on the bands, particularly around 25 kHz up from the band edge (10120 to 10125, 18080 to 18085 and 24905 to 24910 kHz in the WARC bands), you will often work FOC members and, if you can hold a QSO at 25 WPM or so without your CW falling apart, you will find members eager to sponsor you. More details can be found on the FOC web site. Far from being elitist, FOC is an active, friendly and welcoming club that is constantly seeking out new members to share its goals. The character of the club is well expressed in its slogan: ‚ÄúA man should keep his friendship in constant repair\\"- Samuel Johnson (1755).

Programs funded by government are providing some rural housing in the United States and India. Rural housing in the United Kingdom The lack of affordable housing is one of the most critical issues facing rural communities in the UK. This results in people have to move away to find affordable housing, which means that families are separated by distance and are less able to support each other by providing childcare or to do shopping for elderly relatives. Moreover, local services such as schools and shops become increasingly difficult to maintain due to lack of demand, while rural enterprises cannot recruit sufficient workers who live locally. An integrated approach is needed to sustain rural communities. Rural housing in the United States The lack of affordable housing in rural areas of the United States continues to be a critical issue and concern. Factors that can affect affordable rents and home ownership opportunities in Rural America include: lower income levels, urban sprawl pushing housing costs up, loss of high paying jobs and lack of access to credit. Though the American Housing Survey (AHS) \\"Homeownership rates increased for virtually all racial and ethnic groups, income groups, regions, and rural and urban areas during the 1990s.\\" However, according to the US Housing Market Conditions, 2nd quarter, 2007 report by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, \\"Housing affordability worsened as sales prices of existing homes increased and mortgage interest rates increased. Housing market performance was weak in the second quarter of 2007, with generally falling production levels and weak existing home sales. The exceptions are the increase in new home sales and the slight increase in housing starts. Inventories of new and existing homes available for sale continue at very high levels, with enough houses available to last nearly 8 months. The home ownership rate declined to 68.2 percent in the second quarter of 2007.\\" Programs that are addressing the needs of rural housing can be seen through the United States Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Rural Housing Service. Other assistance is available through the Housing Assistance Council which is a non-profit organisation. In the United States, \\"the Housing Assistance Council (HAC) has been helping local organizations build affordable homes in rural America since 1971. HAC emphasizes local solutions, empowerment of the poor, reduced dependence, and self-help strategies. HAC assists in the development of both single- and multi-family homes and promotes home-ownership for working low-income rural families through a self-help, \\"sweat equity\\" construction method. The Housing Assistance Council offers services to public, non-profit, and private organisations throughout the rural United States.

The programme's theme is multi-cultural Norway and it contains interviews with people of different backgrounds than Norwegian. Migrapolis focuses on problems and cultural differences faced by immigrants in Norway. Its goal is to spotlight the positive and negative sides of the internationalisation of Norway. Earlier, the programme featured a multi-lingual news section with news in Vietnamese, Somali, Urdu and other languages. This has since been dropped.,, In 2007, Migrapolis won Gullruten (the equivalent of the American Emmy award), for best show in the category of lifestyle programs. In 2009, Migrapolis received an award for building bridges between people in Norway. The organisation \\" Norske Kirkeakademier\\" rewarded the television show for challenging prejudices in the Norwegian society and for showing how diverse the minorities in the country are. Migrapolis was on the air every Wednesday on prime time. The show was rated in average over 300 000 pr. episode. This represented one third of the viewing audience when the programme was aired. The editorial staff represented a variety of different cultural and religious backgrounds. Today Migrapolis is also a weekly radio show hosted by Dang Trinh.

Background Bred by James R. Keene at his Castleton Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, Maskette was trained by future Hall of Fame inductee James G. Rowe Sr. Racing career Although she did not begin racing until late in the summer of 1908, the New York based two-year-old was nonetheless the top filly in the U.S. that year. Of her six starts, she finished second once and won the other five races, including setting a track record for the Saratoga Race Course in winning the Spinaway Stakes, a premier event of the racing season for juvenile fillies. The most important win of Maskette's racing career came in the 1908 Futurity Stakes at Sheepshead Bay Race Track. She defeated both male and female competition in the Futurity which for decades was the richest and most prestigious race in the United States. The leading filly again at age three, Maskette repeated with five wins and a second in six starts. Of her several major stakes race wins, she captured the Pierrepont Handicap against colts. At age four, she won two of five starts that included another track record, this time at Aqueduct Racetrack.http://www.bloodhorse.com/articleindex/article.asp?id=5225 Stud record Retired to broodmare duty at her owner's Castleton Farm near Lexington, Kentucky, after producing a filly in 1912 Maskette was sold to prominent American owner/breeder William Kissam Vanderbilt, who shipped her to his Haras du Quesnay breeding farm near Deauville in Lower Normandy, France. Maskette produced four stakes winners before her death at age twenty-four in 1930. Honors In 1954, Belmont Park in Elmont, New York honored her memory with the Maskette Stakes, a race for fillies & mares 3-years-old & up.

The selected alignment was initially planned to run adjacent to a BNSF freight line, however opposition from the company has forced the project to be redesigned with a new routing.  Alignment alternatives  The Bottineau Transitway Alternative Analysis Study, released in 2009, outlined several different alternatives for both the northern and southern ends of the corridor. In 2010, the final AA report recommended the A-D1 light rail alignment as the best option, but also suggested B-D1, A-D2 and B-D2 should continue to be studied. A-D1 and B-D1 were also recommended for continued study as possible bus rapid transit alignments. Northern alternatives There are two northern alternatives: Alternative A begins in Maple Grove and runs along Arbor Lakes Parkway and 77th Avenue from Hemlock Lane to the railroad tracks of BNSF Railway's Monticello Subdivision. The potential stations were Hemlock Lane, Zachary Lane, Boone Avenue and 71st Avenue. Alternative B begins in Brooklyn Park near Target North Corporate Campus and runs south along West Broadway to the BNSF railroad tracks. The potential stations are 97th Avenue, 93rd Avenue, 85th Avenue and Brooklyn Boulevard. 71st Avenue Station, though it would run along this alignment's right-of-way, would not be built if this alternative was selected. Middle segment Through the middle portion of the corridor, the study has selected a single alternative. This alternative follows 8 miles of BNSF right-of-way, paralleling County Road 81, from Interstate 694 to 36th Avenue. The proposed stations are 63rd Avenue, Bass Lake Road and Robbinsdale Transit Center. This alignment is known as Alternative C. Southern alternatives The southern part of the corridor has four potential alignments. Three could be used for light rail or bus rapid transit and one would be strictly for bus rapid transit. Every alternative would still terminate at Target Field station. Alternative D1 would continue to follow the BNSF right of way south to Olson Memorial Highway (Minnesota State Highway 55) and would follow Olson Memorial Highway into downtown. Stations would be located at Theodore Wirth Park, Golden Valley Road, Penn Avenue and Van White Boulevard. Alternative D2 would run entirely along streets, instead of partially along railroad right-of-way. It would follow West Broadway to Penn Avenue and Penn Avenue to Olson Memorial Highway into downtown. Stations would be located at North Memorial Medical Center, West Broadway at Penn Ave, Penn Ave at Plymouth Ave and Olson Memorial Highway at Van White Boulevard. Two additional alternatives, D3 and D4, were essentially eliminated in the 2010 report. Transit mode The Northwest Corridor was proposed as a Tier I transitway, for rapid development, in the Metropolitan Council's 2030 Transportation Policy Plan published in 2004. In a region with no operational light rail lines, ridership numbers appeared too low to justify the expense of light rail in this corridor. The line was fast- tracked for development into a busway and much of the work was completed to receive federal funding for construction of a busway. Though this corridor was advanced by the Metropolitan Council for development as a busway, the success of the Blue Line and lobbying by Hennepin County commissioner Mike Opat forced the mode choice to be re-evaluated. In March 2007, the Bottineau Partnership resolved to conduct an alternatives analysis rather than simply building the busway. Hennepin County commissioned a full Alternatives Analysis, to be completed by mid-2009. The recent creation of the Counties Transit Improvement Board, which controls a new dedicated transit tax for the Twin Cities region, has created a strong new push for light rail corridor development. According to the legislation enacting the Counties Transit Improvement Board, in order for a project to receive CTIB funding, it must be part of the Metropolitan Council's long-term transit plan; new planning documents released April 11, 2008 by the Metropolitan Council indicate that the Bottineau Corridor is a strong prospect for LRT, with numbers supporting LRT development. Ridership predictions for the corridor, though lower than those for either the Central or Southwest corridors, are much higher than estimates before the opening of the Blue Line.  Alignment alternatives study results  The alternative analysis study concluded that the best alignment for the Bottineau Corridor would be light rail transit service using Alternatives B, C and D1. The line scored well overall for the three categories of Corridor Benefits, Development Opportunities and Environmental Impacts. The Cost/Benefit Analysis pushed this corridor to the highest position of the potential corridors. This corridor would serve an estimated 27,000 daily riders by 2030. It would take 29 minutes to travel from Brooklyn Park to downtown Minneapolis, a few minutes more than the express bus service. The construction cost estimate for the corridor is $1 billion, in 2017 dollars. Though bus rapid transit would have cost significantly less, estimated at $560 million, it is also estimated that there would have been only 19,900 daily riders.  Design  In August 2014, the Metropolitan Council received federal approval to enter the design phase for the Bottineau LRT, with service expected to begin in 2021. The $997 million light rail extension would be 50% funded by the Federal Transit Administration, 30% by the Counties Transit Improvement Board, 10% by Hennepin County and 10% by the state of Minnesota. Kimley-Horn was awarded an engineering contract worth up to $110 million in September 2014. By 2019, the line was expected to start construction in 2020 and start service in 2024. Opposition, realignment Railway operator BNSF, who owns the property the transitway would utilize between Penn Avenue in Minneapolis and West Broadway in Brooklyn Park, have not been receptive to co-locating light rail trains in the corridor. For of the route, light rail trains would adjacent parallel to the active freight rail tracks of the Monticello Subdivision. The line hosts only two trains per day and has a maximum speed of . Spokesperson Amy McBeth from BNSF Railway stated \\"We don‚Äôt want to leave anyone with the impression we are negotiating. We are not,\\" and \\"We‚Äôve told Met Council repeatedly for the past several years and as recently as this spring that we are not proceeding with any discussion of passenger rail on our property in this corridor.\\" The Federal Transit Administration requires the Metropolitan Council, who is leading the Bottineau Project, to have approval from BNSF Railway before moving forward with the grant process and construction. On July 29, 2020, BNSF reiterated its longstanding stance. ‚ÄúWe are a freight railroad that moves the goods that we all use every day; we provide a vital service, particularly in these unprecedented times. The proposed Blue Line light rail project does not meet our high standards‚Äù On August 3, 2020, the Metropolitan Council announced they would begin to \\"explore opportunities to advance this critical project without using BNSF Railway right of way.\\" The Green Line extension in southwest Minneapolis, currently under construction, will also co-locate light rail operations on BNSF Railway property. The segment parallels approximately of BNSF Railway's Wayzata Subdivision. Negotiations between the Metropolitan Council and BNSF Railway were made, with BNSF requesting there be a crash wall built between the freight tracks and light rail tracks.

The Department of Legal Affairs is concerned with advising the various Ministries of the Central Government while the Legislative Department is concerned with drafting of principal legislation for the Central Government. The ministry is headed by a cabinet rank minister appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of India. The first Law and Justice minister of independent India was Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who served in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet during 1947‚Äì51. Ravi Shankar Prasad is the current Minister of Law and Justice.  History  Ministry of law and justice is the oldest limb of the government of India dating back to 1833 when the Charter Act 1833 was enacted by the British Parliament when India was under British control. The said Act vested for the first time legislative power in a single authority, namely the Governor General in Council. By virtue of this authority and the authority vested under him under section 22 of the Indian Councils Act 1861 the Governor General in Council enacted laws for the country from 1834 to 1920. After the commencement of the Government of India Act 1919 the legislative power was exercised by the Indian Legislature constituted thereunder. The Government of India Act 1919 was followed by the Government of India Act 1935. With the passing of the Indian Independence Act 1947 India became a 'dominion' and the 'dominion legislature' made laws from 1947 to 1949 under the provisions of section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935 as adapted by the India (Provisional Constitution) Order 1947. When the Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950, the legislative power thereafter got vested in the Parliament of India. Organisation The Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules of 1961 entail the various departments working under the Ministry of Law and Justice of Government of India.

Use of the roadway is limited to buses, bicycles, and emergency vehicles. The University of Minnesota runs zero-fare buses along the busway connecting the two campuses, primarily the Campus Connector but also shuttles to and from the St. Paul campus for football games. A bicycle trail runs alongside the transitway for most of its distance. Between the endpoints, there are only two intersections with stoplights controlling busway traffic at Energy Park Drive and Como Avenue. The stoplights are designed to normally give the buses priority, so it is possible for many buses to run the length of the transitway without stopping. Initial plans Plans for a park-and-ride between the Saint Paul and Minneapolis campuses were first introduced in 1976. The project was delayed due to St. Anthony Park neighborhood concerns, required land purchases, University budgets and federal transportation requirements. U.S. Representative Martin Olav Sabo pushed through $2.8 million for the transitway in the 1987 House appropriations bill. The final project was approved in 1990 and included three park and ride lots, two in Minneapolis and one in Saint Paul. The project added 2,400 parking spaces to the Minneapolis campus. The project cost $21 million with $1.2 million from MnDOT, $6.4 million from the University and $13.5 million in federal money from the Interstate Substitution Funds. The busway opened in 1992. Current use There were a large number of crashes in the early years of the transitway. It was determined that many intersections along the route did not have good visibility, so that led to a project in the late 1990s to add magnetic loops and Autoscope devices to detect buses and bicycles. These systems activate lighted stop signs to grab the attention of motorists approaching on cross streets. During the Minnesota State Fair (late August through Labor Day each year), Metro Transit along with other area bus companies use parts of the transitway as a fast way to get to Como Avenue via 280 to Energy Park Drive, creating a seamless park and ride system from across the metro. The transitway also sees usage by non-University buses in other parts of the year. As of 2009, the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority uses the transitway to bring buses to a parking lot across from the State Fairgrounds which is used as a layover point. 2008 modification The western end of the transitway was cut back about ¬º mile (400 m) in 2008 in order to make way for the new TCF Bank Stadium. Previously, it had run all the way to Oak Street in front of Mariucci Arena. This process also removed two stops on the western end of the transitway where there had previously been parking lots. Northbound Campus Connectors loop north around the stadium on 6th Street and Oak Street, while southbound buses use Oak Street to University Avenue before turning right onto 26th Avenue. The western stops were eliminated, while the eastern stops were moved to the entrance of the transitway. Stops at the eastern end of the transitway at Commonwealth Avenue were not affected.

His 1889 lecture, \\"The Architectural Treatment of Gardens\\",Recast in Sedding's, Garden-craft Old and New (1891). was influential in the revival espoused by Reginald Blomfield, of \\"Jacobean\\" features such as terraces, covered walks, bowling greens, clipped yew hedges and topiary, which would combine with \\"cottage garden\\" elements in the Arts and Crafts gardens of 1890‚Äì1915. The German architect and critic Hermann Muthesius said that \\"he formed the first bridge between the architects' camp and that of handicraft proper\\". Biography Sedding in a photograph of 1882Sedding was born in 1838, at Eton in Berkshire. He was the son of a village schoolmaster, who spent much of his youth in Derbyshire. He was 15 when \\"The Nature of Gothic\\" first appeared in John Ruskin's Stones of Venice (1853). In 1858, like William Morris, Philip Webb and Norman Shaw before him, Sedding became a pupil of the Gothic Revival architect, George Edmund Street (1824‚Äì1881). His elder brother, Edmund Sedding, had also trained as an architect with Street. Street had studied in the office of Sir Gilbert Scott (1811‚Äì1878), and his own practice was a cradle of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Sedding left Street in 1863 and by about 1865 he had joined his brother Edmund Sedding, who had set up as an architect in Penzance, Cornwall. The brothers shared an interest in church music, and Edmund is remembered as the composer of the music for the hymn, Jerusalem the Golden. Edmund suffered from tuberculosis and died young in 1868. Sedding moved first to Bristol, and then to London, though he always retained an affection for Cornwall, the West Country and country life. One of his first churches was the Anglo-Catholic St Martin's at Marple in Cheshire completed in 1872. The interior was designed by William Morris with contributions from Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown, Edward Burne-Jones and William Holman Hunt. In 1873 Sedding designed St Clements Church Boscombe, Bournemouth, now a Grade One listed church. The reredos, high altar, candlesticks, church plate, pulpit, lectern, choir stalls, encaustic tiles, statue of St Clement and rood screen were all designed by Sedding. In 1875, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects and moved from Bristol to set up in practice in London the following year, taking offices on the upper floors of 447 Oxford Street, next door to the premises of Morris & Co.. In 1876 Sedding met Ruskin under whose influence he developed a freer Gothic style, introducing natural ornament into his designs. Sedding encouraged his students to study old buildings at first hand, focusing on the practicalities of craft techniques. He placed an emphasis on texture and ornament; the naturalistic treatment of flowers, leaves and animals, always drawn from life; and the close involvement of the architect in the simple processes of building and in the supervision of a team of craftsmen employed direct. He was elected a member of the Art Workers Guild in 1884, the year of its foundation.

His other churches include St Clement's, Boscombe, Dorset (1871‚Äì73), and those at Holbeton and Ermington in Devon, and St Elwyn's (1886‚Äì88) at Hayle in Cornwall.Pevsner 1970, p.80. Pevsner describes the building as \\"not up to the standard of the architect of Holy Trinity, Sloane Street At All Saints' Church, Falmouth (1887‚Äì90), he unconventionally combined tall round-arched arcades with Gothic windows.Pevsner 1970, p.67 He also gained a reputation in the West Country as a skilled repairer of old churches. His most notable work in the Bristol area is the so-called \\"House of Charity\\" (1890‚Äì5), with picturesque detailing. He added a new vestry to St Mary's Church, Stamford, in 1890, and was the architect of St Edward's Church in the Hampshire village of Netley Abbey and the 1870 Church of St Martin, Marple, Stockport. He carried out restorations at St. Levan's Church, St. Levan and St John's Church, West Wickham, Kent; also St Mary's Church, Stogumber, Somerset in 1872‚Äì75. He is noted for his many designs for church furnishings and plate, and contributed rich decorative features to numerous churches, such as screens at Axbridge, Somerset (1888) (with Art Nouveau-style detailing to the arches and lettering), and a reredos at St Saviour's, Walcot, Bath. With Henry Wilson (who completed the work on Sedding's death), he was commissioned by 6th Duke of Portland to create an extension to Welbeck Abbey to link the old building with the Riding School. He was also commissioned to build a Chapel, which was also completed by Wilson. Both buildings contain very fine Arts and Crafts design features including a St George and the Dragon moulding over the fireplace with the tail forming a frieze around the room and magnificent bronze door to the chapel and a particularly fine font and altar table. Information from Guide at Welbeck Abbey Death Sedding died on 7 April 1891, at Winsford in Somerset. There is a memorial on the north wall of the Lady Chapel of Holy Trinity Sloane Street. He was buried in the churchyard of St John's Church, West Wickham. His wife, Rose, died a few weeks after him.

It works on the principle that the hydrostatic head of the \\"kill fluid\\" or \\"kill mud\\" will be enough to suppress the pressure of the formation fluids. Well kills may be planned in the case of advanced interventions such as workovers, or be contingency operations. The situation calling for a well kill will dictate the method taken. Not all well kills are deliberate. Sometimes, the unintended buildup of fluids, either from injection of chemicals like methanol from surface, or from liquids produced from the reservoir, can be enough to kill the well, particularly gas wells, which are notoriously easy to kill. Well control in general is an extremely expensive and dangerous operation. Extensive training, testing, proof of competence, and experience are prerequisites for planning and performing a well kill, even a seemingly simple one. Many people have died through incorrectly performed well kills. Principles The principle of a well kill revolves around the weight of a column of fluid and hence the pressure exerted at the bottom. P=hg\\\\rho Where P is the pressure at depth h in the column, g is the acceleration of gravity and œÅ is the density of the fluid. It is common in the oil industry to use weight density, which is the product of mass density and the acceleration of gravity. This reduces the equation to: P=h\\\\gamma Where Œ≥ is the weight density. Weight density may also be described as the pressure gradient because it directly determines how much extra pressure will be added by increasing depth of the column of fluid. The objective in a well kill, is to make the pressure at the bottom of the kill fluid equal (or slightly greater) than the pressure of the reservoir fluids. Example The pressure of the reservoir fluids at the bottom of the hole is 38MPa. We have a kill fluid with a weight density of 16kN.m‚àí3. What will need to be the height of the hydrostatic head in order to kill the well? From the equation: h=\\\\frac{P}{\\\\gamma} h=\\\\frac{38\\\\,MPa}{16\\\\,kNm^{-3}} h=2375\\\\,m Therefore, a column of 2375m of this fluid is needed. This refers to the true vertical depth of the column, not the measured depth, which is always larger than true vertical depth due to deviations from vertical. Math in the oil field In the oil industry, a pure SI system is extremely rare. Weight densities are commonly either given as specific gravity or in pounds per gallon. Simple conversion factors (0.433 for specific gravity and 0.052 for ppg) convert these values to a pressure gradient in psi per foot. Multiplying by the depth in feet gives the pressure at the bottom of the column. Of course, when the well is being drilled in metres as the depth unit, the maths gets more complicated. Since well-kill certification is normally (in the US/ UK) done in \\"oil field units\\" (feet for length, inches for diameters, oilfield barrels for volume-pumped, psi for pressures), complex workarounds are often performed to keep the planned calculations in line with local regulations and industry \\"best practice\\". Methods of well kill During all well kills, careful attention must be paid to not exceeding the formation strength at the weakest point of the wellbore (or casing/ liner pipes, as appropriate), the \\"fracture pressure\\", otherwise fluid will be lost from the wellbore to the formation. Since this lost volume is unknown, it becomes very hard to tell how the kill is proceeding, especially if gas is involved with its large volume change through different parts of the wellbore. Combining a well kill with such a \\"lost circulation\\" situation is a serious problem. Lost circulation situations can, of course, also lead to well kill situations. Reverse circulation This is often the tidiest way of making a planned well kill. It involves pumping kill fluid down the 'A' annulus of the well, through a point of communication between it and the production tubing just above the production packer and up the tubing, displacing the lighter well bore fluids, which are allowed to flow to production. The point of communication was traditionally a device called a sliding sleeve, or sliding side door, which is a hydraulically operated device, built into the production tubing. During normal operation, it would remain closed sealing off the tubing and the annulus, but for events such as this, it would be opened to allow the free flow of fluids between the two regions. These components have fallen out of favour as they were prone to leaking. Instead, it is now more common to punch a hole in the tubing for circulation kills. Although this permanently damages the tubing, given that most planned well kills are for workovers, this is not an issue, since the tubing is being pulled for replacement anyway. Bullheading This is the most common method of a contingency well kill. If there is a sudden need to kill a well quickly, without the time for rigging up for circulation, the more blunt instrument of bullheading may be used. This involves simply pumping the kill fluid directly down the well bore, forcing the well bore fluids back into the reservoir. This can be effective at achieving the central aim of a well kill; building up a sufficient hydrostatic head in the well bore. However, it can be limited by the burst-pressure capabilities of the tubing or casing, and can risk damaging the reservoir by forcing undesired materials into it. The principal advantage is that it can be done with little advanced planning. Forward circulation This is similar to reverse circulation, except the kill fluid is pumped into the production tubing and circulated out through the annulus. Though effective, it is not as desirable since it is preferred that the well bore fluids be displaced out to production, rather than the annulus. Lubricate and bleed This is the most time-consuming form of well kill. It involves repeatedly pumping in small quantities of kill mud into the well bore and then bleeding off excess pressure. It works on the principle that the heavier kill mud will sink below the lighter well bore fluids and so bleeding off the pressure will remove the latter, leaving an increasing quantity of kill mud in the well bore with successive steps. Well kills during drilling operations During drilling, pressure control is maintained through the use of precisely concocted drilling fluid, which balances out the pressure at the bottom of the hole. In the event of suddenly encountering a high-pressure pocket, pressure due to drilling fluid may not be able to counter the high formation pressure. Allowing formation fluid to enter into the well-bore. This influx of formation fluid is called kick and then it becomes necessary to kill the well. This is done by pumping kill mud down the drill pipe, where it circulates out the bottom and into the well bore. Reversing a well kill The intention of a well kill (or the reality of an unintentional well kill) is to stop reservoir fluids flowing to surface. This of course creates problems when it is desirable to get the well flowing again. In order to reverse the well kill, the kill fluid must be displaced from the well bore. This involves injecting a gas at high pressure, usually nitrogen since it is inert and relatively cheap. A gas can be put under sufficient pressure to allow it to push heavy kill fluid, but will then expand and become light once pressure is removed. This means that having displaced the kill fluid, it will not itself kill the well. Low-density (\\"light\\") liquids such as diesel fuel, or the \\"base fluid\\" for a \\"(synthetic) oil-based mud\\" can also be used, depending on availability and pressure-management issues for a specific well. The reservoir fluids should be able to flow to surface, displacing the gas. The cheapest way to do it is similar to bullheading, where the light fluid (nitrogen, or low- density liquid) is pumped in under high pressure to force the kill fluid into the reservoir. This, of course, runs a high risk of causing well damage. The most effective way is to use coiled tubing, pumping the gas/diesel down the coil and circulating out the bottom into the well bore, where it will displace the kill mud to production. (Of course, getting a coiled tubing spread to the location may take weeks of work and logistics.)

Its products are well respected for their unique sound,\\"Istanbul Agop Mel Lewis Signature Cymbals\\" on MikeDolbear.com which is formed by the method and the alloy used, the formula of which is known only to the owners of the firm, Armenians Arman and Sarkis Tomurcuk. It is one of two companies that formed after the split of Istanbul Cymbals. History The art of Turkish cymbal making dates back to the 16th century, the time of the Ottoman Empire. The very first cymbals manufactured in Turkey were actually bells, created for the use in churches. Later on, as the story goes, cymbals were produced for the Ottoman military band. In the 20th century, it had become well known that Istanbul had evolved into the cymbal-making capital of the world.Hugo Pinksterboe: The Cymbal Book, published by Hal Leonard (1992) - Generations of master cymbal smiths developed, refined, and redefined this art in their endless search for perfection. They formulated the most musical alloy and developed and tested hand-crafting methods which had been used for centuries. As the 20th century drew to its close, the traditional Turkish method for hand crafting cymbals had all but been abandoned due to the efficiencies and mass production facility provided by machines. In 1980, the first Istanbul Cymbals began to be produced by Agop Tomurcuk, who had been working in the business of hand-made cymbal manufacture since the age of nine and had worked at the only cymbal factory in Turkey becoming the chief cymbal smith until the factory's closure in 1977. Agop's friend and partner Mehmet Tamdeger established Zilciler Kollektif Sti and chose \\"Zilciler\\" as their brand name. Shortly afterwards the brand name was changed to Istanbul. During the following years, they also developed many original designs, while still employing the traditional methods. Many of these inventive designs are in their production-line today. In 1996 Agop Tomurcuk died in an accident, and as a result the company began to be pulled in two separate directions. It was determined that the company must be split. Agop's sons, Arman and Sarkis, continued their way by following in the footsteps of their father, and Mehmet was free to run his own separate company as he saw fit. Both companies had the benefit of the well-respected \\"Istanbul\\" name, but differentiated by the addition of \\"Agop\\" and \\"Mehmet,\\" which can be seen on their respective logos.History on Alchemy website  Brands  Various Alchemy cymbals \\"Alchemy Cymbals\\" is a brand of hand-made cymbals belonging to Istanbul Agop; the brand has its own production line.

She was of Swedish or Danish origin. The battle was between King Harald Hildetand of Denmark and Sweden, and his Viceroy King Sigurd Hring of Sweden; Sweden was during this age several little kingdoms, but Harald Hildetand had been elected king over most of them. King Sigurd had plans to unite all these kingdoms under one crown permanently, while king Harald wished to keep the possibility of electing different kings to each one, and the battle was therefore between unionists and separatists. It is said that the different sides drew mercenaries from Russia, England, Germany and Ireland, and on the side of the separatists of king Harald participated three hundred female soldiers, so- called Shieldmaidens, and the most famous one, besides Visna and Harald's own daughter Princess Hed, was Veborg; these three women are described as the generals of the female troops. Veborg's contribution in the battle is described in detail; One of the strongest warriors of King Harald was Ubbe from Friesland, who defeated three Swedish princes and the fighter Agnar before he was finally killed by one of the greatest fighters of the unionists, the warrior Starke. Veborg then rushed forward to kill Starke; She cut off his jaw, but he managed to escape her and cut off the arm of the Shieldmaiden Visna, who was holding the separatists banner.

The building is protected by a covenant, which states that it is to only be used for community, arts, youth and education services. This covenant has influenced much of the building's recent use as an arts and community venue. Holy Trinity Church The church was built between 1829 and 1832 by Thomas Rickman and Henry Hutchinson, two architects from Birmingham, who also designed the piers, perimeter walls and railings which are also listed. The church is built using Bath stone in a Perpendicular style, a style of English Gothic architecture characterised by its strong emphasis on the vertical elements and its linear design.Chilcott, John, Chilcott's Stranger's Guide to Bristol, 1859 It has two octagonal bell towers with open turrets on the west face of the building.Pryce, George: A Popular History Of Bristol, 1861 The towers sit on either side of the main entrance and the west window. During a period when the building sat empty, the bells were taken and either sold for scrap or to another church. The towers now sit empty and are occupied only by bats and pigeons. The original bells and fittings were replaced with new ones in April 1927. The work was carried out by local firm Llewellins & James Ltd of Castle Green. It cost ¬£47 10s for bells and labour although an additional ¬£3 10s was incurred when the workmen realised that they had to remove the floor of the towers to get the new bells in. The Holy Trinity Church had 2,200 seats with 1,500 of these being free. Spoils of War The Napoleonic War against France, which had raged for 12 years ended in 1815, with the defeat of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo. With victory came money for Britain and her allies. In 1818, ¬£1,000,000 was given by Parliament to build new churches across the country. In 1824, a further ¬£500,000 was given to continue with the mass build. The acts became known as the 'Million' and 'Half Million' Acts. Churches built as a result of these acts became known as 'Million', 'Half Million', or Waterloo churches. Design and build Black and white photograph postcard from 1905 showing the west end of the church, Holy Trinity St Philips, Bristol, UK, also showing a horse and cart and three figures. ¬£6,000 was given to the out parish of St Philip's with a further ¬£2,200 raised by the laymen. This and other sources brought the total cost of the build to ¬£9,020 19s. 4d. The church took 26 months of hard work to build. The foundation stone was laid on 22 September 1829, by the Lord Mayor John Cave. The consecration of the completed church took place by the Bishop of Bristol on 17 February 1832.Chilcott, John, Chilcott's Descriptive History of Bristol, Ancient and modern, 1851 Later work was carried out on the building circa 1882 by John Bevan and in 1905 by William Venn Gough. Graveyard Due to the relatively small size of Trinity's graveyard, when graves were dug, they were dug deep and coffins were stacked on top of each other to maximise the use of space.John Latimer, Annals of Bristol in the 19th Century, 1887 When the church was deconsecrated the coffins were exhumed and moved to other graveyards such as Arnos Vale Cemetery. Crime In the 19th Century there was no provision for street lighting or for constables to patrol after dark. Hand-in-hand with this went crime. Attempts to curb crime by making the death penalty a mandatory sentence for even the smallest capital felony had little perceived impact. Local authorities felt the way to address the problem was to engage the spiralling population in Christian worship, and the Holy Trinity Church was built.Bishop, Ian S, Stories from St.Phillip's (), 2002 On 24 April 1869, policeman PC Richard Hill 273 was stabbed to death by 19-year-old local labourer William Pullin.Nicola Sly, Bristol Murders (Sutton True Crime History), 2008 Thousands of people turned up to his funeral at Trinity, lining the streets all the way from the church to the burial at Arnos Vale. Pullin would have hanged had it not been for the intervention of more than 7,000 individuals petitioning for mercy on his behalf, on the grounds that he was a young man of good nature who had come to this terrible act due to circumstance.http://www.gertlushonline.co.uk/murdered-in-the-line-of- duty.html A marble memorial tablet that once resided in the Holy Trinity Church can now be found in the foyer of Old Market's Trinity Road police station, which reads: In memory of Richard Hill, police constable of this city, who was murdered whilst in the execution of his duty in Gloucester Lane, 24 April 1869, aged 31 years, and was interred in Arnos Vale Cemetery. This tablet was erected as a mark of esteem by his brother officers and inhabitants of the city. A brave man: PC Richard Hill was not forgotten. Archives Parish records for Holy Trinity church, St Philip's, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.HT) (online catalogue) including baptism, marriage and burial registers. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, vestry, parochial church council, churchwardens, charities, Easton Christian Family Centre, schools and societies plus photographs. 1960s The Holy Trinity Church of St Philip & St Jacob finally closed due to dwindling congregations and lack of money. The building sat empty for a decade, spiralling ever further into disrepair, due to vandalism and looting.Bristol Evening Post, 14 December 1967 1970s Discontent amongst black and minority ethnic young people escalated due to unemployment and increasing clashes with the police.Bristol: Ethnic Minorities and the City 1000 ‚Äì 2001, by Madge Dresser & Peter Flemming, Local leaders looking to ease tensions agreed for Trinity to be deconsecrated and given to the public, for use as a community centre, with a focus on activities for young people. The building was transferred to the African-Caribbean Community Association (also known as the Bristol Caribbean Community Enterprise Group) with a 50-year lease, under the management of Mr Roy de Freitas. The group carried out extensive repairs and alternations to the building, including the installation of a second floor. On 1 July 1978, the same day as St Paul's Festival, now called Carnival, Trinity Community Centre was opened to the public.Bristol Evening Post, 11 March 1977 1980s The Trinity Centre's early years as a community centre and music venue were set against a backdrop of rising local tensions, culminating in the St. Pauls riot. During the early part of this decade, the centre provided a much needed outlet for local youth culture, hosting nights of dub and reggae from the likes of Jah Shaka and Quaker City, and playing host to some of the biggest domestic and international music stars of the time, notably from the punk and new wave genres, such as U2, Crass, The Cramps, Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division and New Order alongside local favourites such as The Stingrays and Disorder. As a music venue, Trinity was a melting pot for the different styles popular at the time, from reggae through ska to punk. From this came a post-punk scene which blended many of these influences. Trinity saw regular performances from local acts such as Mark Stewart and The Pop Group, who through their collaborations with artists and producers from the reggae scene, as well as artists such as On-U Sound System and Gary Clail laid the foundations for the later trip hop genre, known as the \\"Bristol Sound\\". In 1984 the African-Caribbean Community Association went into insolvency due to financial mismanagement, with large bank and Inland Revenue debts. Allegations were rife Mr de Freitas had embezzled funds and fled to Jamaica, though it eventually transpired that he was in fact living with his sister in Clevedon, having sold his own house to invest in a cafe for the centre, which he had hoped would help to pay off Trinity's debts.Bristol Evening Post, 12 February 1985 The 50-year lease that had been granted to the community was prematurely terminated and by default the building was transferred to the local council. 1990s After a spell of sitting empty, the building was put out to tender by Bristol City Council and was taken on by the New Trinity Community Association in 1991. The new tenants and a dedicated team of volunteers began an extensive round of development and renovations, which included the installation of the sprung wooden floor downstairs, and new railings. The Centre reopened in 1992, and under this new management Trinity again gained international fame as an important landmark in the globally exported Bristol Sound, prominent during this era, playing host to local acts such as Roni Size, Smith & Mighty and Portishead. As well as the successful music nights there were also daytime community activities. From bingo madness to a boxing club the two levels provided a much needed space for everyone to use. Shifting funds away from community centres towards Millennium Projects coupled with a series of financial problems, echoing those which led to the demise of the previous group, Trinity was forced to close once again in 2000. Today In 2001, Trinity Community Arts formed to reopen the Trinity Centre. Funding was received through the Bristol Objective 2 Action Plan ‚Äì a strategic development fund across the City, designed to address social, economic and environmental decline and disadvantage ‚Äì to improve access within the building and make it fit for use by the community. Since reopening in 2004, it has become a prominent arts venue within Bristol. The Centre is continuing in its tradition as a Bristol community hub and music venue, as well as providing recording and broadcast studios, and training around media arts and technology, run almost entirely upon free, open source software.Open-source software In 2011 the team at the Trinity Centre began an application to the Big Lottery Reaching Community Fund of ¬£460,000 for building renovations that would improve accessibility, range of possible activities and quality for users within the building. This application was completed and accepted in 2012 and included renovation of the upstairs hall ( Fyfe Hall ), a more accessible reception area and the creation of a community common room that will allow residents to access the Internet, hold meetings and run workshops within their community. Building work started in 2013 and are due to be completed in 2014. In 2014 Trinity Community Arts gained a licence to perform civil ceremonies and now can hold weddings under the Civil Partnership Act of 2004. The last wedding ceremony held at the centre prior to this was on 20 March 1976, two weeks before its closure at the Holy Trinity Church on 6 April 1976.

Kornbluth. It was first published in Galaxy Science Fiction magazine in February 1962, almost four years after Kornbluth's death. According to a foreword by Pohl in a collection also called Critical Mass, the story was assembled from notes Kornbluth made for three story ideas, plus one of Pohl's own from 1954. After Kornbluth's death, his widow turned over his story notes and drafts to Pohl. Pohl completed a dozen or so stories based on this material, most of which were eventually collected in the volume \\"The Wonder Effect\\" which contained most of the same stories as the later \\"Critical Mass\\" collection. Arthur C. Clarke also wrote a short story with this title. It is included in his collection Tales from the White Hart. Plot introduction The story takes place in 1998. The Cold War has continued for about 50 years. America is in a state of constant readiness for nuclear attack. Shelter drills are an everyday occurrence. They are accompanied by military exercises which rehearse destroying attacking aircraft and missiles. Despite this, life goes on as it always has. People gripe about the drills, but would far rather talk about political issues or, better yet, baseball. The lives of three people, a newly minted civil engineering graduate, a statistician and a magazine editor, intersect. This starts a chain reaction which leads to the overturning of the status quo. An important character in the story is the President of the United States. A former New Jersey accountant, state senator and Governor, who nonetheless thinks of himself as a \\"hard riding, hard drinking Southern gentleman\\", he is a front for an army of advisers and fixers who tell him what to say through a wireless earphone. He leads the \\"Middle Roaders\\", apparently a Republican faction. The opposition are the \\"Nationalists\\" who favor a sudden first strike, or \\"sneak punch\\" against the Communists. The Democratic party is despised, being routinely referred to as the \\"Party of Treason\\". The burning political issue in Congress and the nation is the \\"Civilian Shelters Bill\\", or \\"C.S.B.\\", a plan to build deep air-raid shelters capable of housing the entire nation. So disconnected is the President that he knows nothing about this. The other obsession, the Baseball All-Star Game, is something he knows all about, and is looking forward to watching. This is the man who, at the end of the story, has to pick up the pieces and move the nation forward. Explanation of the title As is revealed in the story, society has attained a state where, like a critical mass of fissionable material, one random event will lead to a complete transformation. The metaphor is extended by the story explicitly likening one character to a neutron, another to a nucleus, and the President to a neutron moderator. The accidental collision of the characters initiates the chain reaction. Plot summary Walter Chase, a fresh graduate of Civil Engineering from \\"Eastern University\\", is a man on the make. Having been skillfully steered into his education with the promise of a guaranteed job on the Shelter programs to come, he regards all the people he meets as potential stepping stones on his way up the ladder. Those who do not look like good prospects he efficiently discards, an example being his college girlfriend whose father is only a passed-over Federal bureaucrat. Leaving college behind, he heads towards his destiny, the first stop being the staff of Senator David Horton, of Indiana, a passionate and slightly unstable advocate of the Civilian Shelters Bill. Arturo Denzer, whom we first encounter bracing himself to face the day with the aid of vitamins, aspirin, thyroid extract, caffeine, nicotine and amphetamine, is ironically the editor of Nature's Way Magazine, specializing in reviews of \\"natural\\" food products. Getting to work is a matter of negotiating robotic elevators and taxis, all of whom attempt to draw him into unwanted conversations about the All-Star Game and the Civilian Shelters Bill. The worst is the taxi, which being a \\"Black and White hack\\", addresses him as \\"Mac\\". Arriving at his office in Washington D.C., he finds that a crucial lab report is missing, so he and his assistant, Maggie Frome, have to personally travel to the labs to collect it. On the way, they stop the taxi bothering them by pretending to be lovers \\"making out\\" in the back seat. The taxis are programmed simply to wink and chuckle at this. In reality they are discussing the upcoming edition of the magazine. At the Nature's Way labs Arturo Denzer and Maggie Frome encounter the scientist Valendora, who prepared the report they came to collect. Valendora is disgusted when his boss at the lab decides that certain harmful side-effects of the product, Aztec Cocawine, can be overlooked. At this point an air-raid drill throws everything into confusion. Denzer and Maggie have to spend time in the shelter where everyone around them wants to discuss, as loudly as possible, the upcoming All-Star Game or the C.S.B. Frustrated beyond measure, Maggie yells at those near her to shut up, uttering the rude \\"P-word\\" (politics), much to Denzer's dismay. President Braden appears at the daily White House press briefing, where it becomes apparent that he simply parrots what he hears in his earphone. The assembled correspondents likewise pretend that he is talking \\"off the cuff\\". Asked about C.S.B. the President delivers a formulaic speech about moving it forward, even though he knows nothing about it. He then has a meeting with Senator Horton, who almost has a meltdown in the Oval Office, so frustrated is he with the lack of progress of the bill. After Horton leaves, Braden tries to find out about C.S.B., only to be told by Senator Jim Harkness, who chairs the committee Horton sits on, that the whole thing is just an issue that has to be kept on the boil for as long as possible, there being no other significant political issues to use as a platform for re-election. Harkness is contemptuous of Horton, regarding him as a makeweight on the committee and a loose cannon politically. He recommends that the President \\"put some money\\" in Horton's district before the next election. Emerging from the air-raid shelter, Denzer and Maggie are arrested because they are not wearing mandatory dosimeters. Tossed into a holding cell with other miscreants and drunks, they encounter Valendora and Chase, who are similarly inconvenienced. Valendora has a statistics article he needs to get to a reputable journal. Chase has a thesis that requires Senator Horton's urgent attention. Denzer has his own deadline to worry about. Fortunately at their arraignment Maggie spots a friend, another journalist who is covering the court for her newspaper. They retrieve what they think is Denzer's envelope from a pile, hand her the material to take to Nature's Way with instructions to the magazine compositor to rush it into print. Then they settle down to wait their turn to make bail. To their horror, when they emerge to get a copy of the magazine, instantly printed on the sidewalk by yet another robot, they find that the materials they sent were Chase's thesis and Valendora's journal article. Digested by the magazine's computer they announce to the world that, according to Valendora, the All-Star Game is the most likely time for a \\"sneak punch\\" attack by the Communists, and according to Chase, the planned Civilian Shelters will be ineffective even against chemical explosives, let alone nuclear bombs. Valendora offers another, less scientific, prediction. :\\"I estimate that within five minutes we will all be back in the calabazo\\" (i.e. jail). The story continues \\"But he was wrong. It was actually less than three.\\" The final act takes place in the President's office during the All-Star Game, with Senator Horton explaining why the four of them, then sitting meekly on a couch nearby, have just saved the country. Publishing Valendora's article not only caused the armed forces to check their own data and go on alert, it caused the Communists to hold back because the element of surprise had been lost. The nation's obsession with the All-Star Game would have caused everyone to be \\"looking the other way\\" as the attack commenced. Horton notes that Nazi Germany used a similar tactic of scheduling attacks for holidays and long weekends. At the same time as Valendora's analysis deflected the attack, Chase's thesis effectively deflated C.S.B. This removed the issue platform that the President's party had intended to milk for all it was worth, aiming to re-elect him in 2000. Here the President finds himself cast adrift. The voice in his ear is silent. His aides cannot help him. Looking at his clean desktop, where once Harry S. Truman had a sign saying \\"The buck stops here\\", he sees that even without a sign, this is the place where decisions have to be made, for better or worse. He tells Horton about his days at West Point, when he wrote what, to him, was a revelatory history paper about societal obsessions, such as monarchy and slavery, that got bigger and more all- consuming until they collapsed. His hopes for distinction were dashed when his tutor pointed out that Arnold J. Toynbee had already covered the same ground. Still, he realizes that he has been witness to just such a collapse. Summoning what leadership he can muster, he decides that he and only he can take the next step. He explains this to Horton. Back on the street, Chase, Valendora and Denzer face their own futures. Chase may be able to salvage his former college relationship. Valendora has to get to his journal's office to update his article. And Denzer begins to realize that Maggie Frome may be more than just an assistant to him. He flags down a taxi and they climb into the back seat. The taxi chuckles and winks on cue, but this time the couple are not pretending.

The surname is pronounced in Ireland as \\"Ver-Skoil\\" and in England as \\"Ver- Shoy-Ul\\". History The family of Verschoyle (Verschuyl) were Dutch Huguenots who emigrated from the Netherlands to Ireland in 1568, having suffered from religious persecution due. Other accounts state that they travelled to Ireland with William of Orange, and later married into ancient Irish clans. The family coat of arms features three boars heads on a chevron, with the motto ', which roughly translates as \\"steadfast and constrained\\". Pedigree According to the pedigree in Gens Van Der Scuylen, 600 years of Verschoyle history, with information added from Burke's Landed Gentry, the following lineage is described: Early in the 17th century two of the name said to be brothers, Henrik and William, were resident in Dublin.

The name Lorenzo has also been added in recognition of James's grandfather. Captain James Lorenzo Verschoyle, of the 66th Regiment (now Royal Berkshires)1832-1875, married Countess Caroline d'Assereto - the only child of the Marquis d'Assereto, and under normal rules the eldest child or next in line for the title is styled one below in the peerage rank, from the father, hence being a Countess.

Since 1999 it has been used as a music venue known as St George's Bristol. It was built in the 1820s by Sir Robert Smirke. It is a Grade II* listed building. History St George's was built for use as a church in the Clifton area of Bristol, England, between 1821 and 1823 by the architect Sir Robert Smirke, who designed it in the Greek Revival style. It was a \\"Waterloo church\\", the only one in Bristol to receive government money from the first grant under the Church Building Act of 1818. It has been designated as a grade II* listed building. Plate etching of St George's Church, Brandon Hill, Bristol, UK, published before 1958. Viewed from the south, the image shows the church as it looked before the modern landscaping of its grounds. In the foreground is a street scene with five people ascending the steps to the church. In 1999, the church underwent extensive renovations to make it suitable for use as a full-time concert venue and it re-opened that October under the name by which it is now known, St George's Bristol. Archives Parish records for St George's church, Brandon Hill, Bristol are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. P.St GB) (online catalogue) including baptism and marriage registers and one burial register. The archive also includes records of the incumbent, churchwardens, parochial church council and charities, plus plans and photographs. Concert venue In 1976 St George's Music Trust was formed and in succeeding years they established the church as a major concert venue, initially known as St George's, Brandon Hill. The main body of the church seats 562 people and the crypt has been transformed into a bar and recording studios which are regularly used by the BBC. The 1999 renovations were extensive. They included replacing the auditorium pews with padded chairs, making the pews in the gallery more comfortable for concert seating, creating a box office and removing the font which was donated to the Church of St Mary on the Quay. St George's Bristol is particularly known for presenting classical, jazz, folk, world music and opera and stages more than 200 events every year, regularly attracting artists of international note including Angela Hewitt, Nicola Benedetti, Mark Padmore, plus The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (in Spring/Summer of 2010) and Viktoria Mullova, Stephen Hough, Paul Lewis, Christian Blackshaw, Janis Ian, Abdullah Ibrahim and Marc Almond (in Autumn 2011). In addition, regular performances are given by local professional groups such as the Bristol Ensemble and amateur orchestras and choirs.

Her maiden name was Kotegawa Yae. Early life Nogami was born in Usuki in Oita prefecture as the daughter of a wealthy sake brewer. She was taught at home by private tutors, including Kubo Kaizo, who introduced her to classic Chinese literature, classic Japanese literature and taught her the art of writing tanka poetry. She met the novelist Kinoshita Naoe, who persuaded her to enter the Meiji-Jogakk≈ç, a Christian-orientated girls‚Äô school in Tokyo. While a student in Tokyo, she met Nogami Toyoichir≈ç, a student of Noh drama and English literature under Natsume S≈çseki. They were married in 1906, but she continued to work towards literary recognition. Her first published work was a short story Enishi (\\"Ties of Love\\") in the literary magazine Hototogisu in 1907. Literary career In the 1910s, Nogami submitted poems and short stories to the mainstream literary journal Chuo Koron, Shincho, and to the feminist magazine Seito, and gained a substantial following with fans of the proletarian literature movement. She maintained a correspondence with fellow female writers Yuasa Yoshiko and Miyamoto Yuriko, with whom she shared the sentiment that literature must serve a purpose towards increasing morality and social activism. In 1922, she published Kaijin maru (\\"The Neptune\\", tr. 1957), a shocking semi-factual account of four men in the crew of a wrecked fishing boat who must struggle with the choice of starvation or cannibalism. This novel was adapted into the 1962 film Ningen directed by Kaneto Shindo. Nogami started to explore historical fiction in the 1920s, with Oishi Yoshio, a story about one of the Forty-seven Ronin in 1926. That same year, she and her husband translated Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice into Japanese, which was the first translation of Austen into Japanese. Nogami liked Pride and Prejudice so much that in 1928 she published a novel, Machiko, that reset Pride and Prejudice in Taish≈ç era Japan, with the heroine Machiko who was inspired by Elizabeth Bennet, the hero Mr. Kawai who was based on Mr. Darcy, and the villain Seki who was based on Wickham. As the Japanese government turned increasingly toward totalitarianism and it appeared that war was inevitable, she and her husband traveled to Europe where they witnessed the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and ominous signs that would lead up to World War II. They returned to Japan prior to the outbreak of World War II, and she concentrated on her writing. In the post-war period, she resumed her contacts with Miyamoto Yuriko, and joined her in the foundation of the Shin Nihon Bungakukai. Her postwar output was prolific and varied, including the Yomiuri Prize-winning 1957 novel and Hideyoshi to Rikyu (\\"Hideyoshi and Rikyu\\", 1962‚Äì1963), in which she explores the relationship between artist and patron (in this case Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Sen no Riky≈´). The latter novel was adapted into the film Rikyu by Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara.

Some techniques are used for moving along the ground while others are used for evading attacks and it is not uncommon to see a combination of the two. There are hard attacks that include headbutts, slaps, punches, elbows, kicks and knees as well as softer attacks such as takedowns or sweeps; however, the main emphasis is normally placed on the interaction between kicks and evasions. The most confusing group of techniques for many outside the capoeira circle are florieos which often results in capoeira being mistaken for breakdancing or acrobatics. A huge synergy of West African martial arts, cultures, and traditions such as Hausa Dambe, kulunga fighting, and Nuba wrestling have all had an influence on capoeira techniques. These combined with the colorful acrobatic performances during the festivals all came together to form the capoeira that many are familiar with today. A large amount of these same techniques can be found in other martial arts from the African Diaspora such as knocking and kicking from the Sea Islands, ladya from Martinique or juego de mani from Cuba. There are also many techniques in capoeira found in more well-known Asian martial arts. During the end of slavery and beginning of the formation of different gangs or maltas, weapons such as clubs, straight razors, machetes, among others were used by many capoeiristas. With the exception of machetes used during machulele performances, most capoeiristas no longer train with weapons. It is important to note that for historical reasons, different groups often use different names for the same techniques, and even the same name for different techniques. Some capoeira groups prefer to preserve the traditional techniques while other seek to evolve. Movement=Ginga  Animation of ginga movement The ginga (pronounced jeen-gah; literally: rocking back and forth; to swing) is the fundamental footwork of capoeira. Its constant triangular footwork makes capoeira easily recognizable as well as confusing since it looks much more like a rhythmic dance step than an orthodox static fighting stance. Only a few martial arts employ similar rhythmic footwork found in the ginga. South Korea's Taekkyeon and some forms for Pencak Silat are a few others. The main purpose is not dancing but rather to prepare the body for any number of movements such as evading, feinting, or delivering attacks while continuously shifting stances all while providing confusion. The ginga places the capoeirista in constant motion, making them a frustrating target for a forward-advancing opponent,. The ginga also allows the capoeirista to continuously maintain enough torque to use in a strike while providing a synchronization of arm movement to avoid and slip under attacks. The ginga is not static so its speed is usually determined by the toque or rhythm dictated by the bateria. Capoeira Angola and capoeira regional both have distinctive versions of this movement. In Capoeira Angola, the ginga is more expressive and individualistic, while in Capoeira Regional the ginga has a more structured and defensive look. Most Capoeira regional academies teach the ginga in the same way until the student advances to a certain level and begins to develop their own expressive and comfortable way of using it. Cadeira Paralelo The cadeira or paralelo is a low squat that shares many similarities with the horse stance found in Eastern martial arts. One arm protects the face while the other is extended out protecting the torso. Every time a capoeirista brings his feet parallel during a ginga, he enters this position. A√∫ The capoeira term for what is more generally known as a cartwheel. It differs a bit from the traditional cartwheel because of their different intentions. An a√∫, in its base form, is performed very slowly, with arms and legs bent in order to keep a low target profile. Players sometime pause midway during an a√∫ holding it for a [handstand] position, from which they can execute a wide variety of moves. There is always the existing risk of receiving a low headbutt, front push kick, or some other attack while inverted. To combat this an emphasis is placed on closely watching the movements and intentions of the other player instead of the ground. While the main purpose of using the a√∫ is more geared towards mobility and evasion there are still more ingenious variations of employing it. Capoeira players can incorporate unpredictable strikes as well as floeiros from the a√∫. These include inverted kicks as well as jumping movements that do not involve the hand. *A√∫ Aberto‚ÄîFrom esquiva, the free arm reaches in an arc over the head in the direction of motion. The leg extended furthest from the body leaves the ground first, kicking off and providing momentum. Then the reaching hand is placed on the far side of the body. Bending the arms at the elbows supports weight as both legs pass over the body fully extended. While inverted, the body should be opened and entirely extended. One foot touches the ground then the other. The arms must be lifted for protection as soon as they are no longer supporting weight. *A√∫ Batido‚ÄîThe a√∫ batido is an a√∫ variation where a practitioner does a handstand, followed by a twist with the hips and a split, performing a downward martelo. During the kick, one arm is protecting the face while the other one is obviously supporting the body. A√∫ batido literally means \\"broken cartwheel\\". This movement is a defensive move, used when attempting to perform a cartwheel and the opponent attacks, generally with a cabe√ßada, a headbutt, the a√∫ batido takes place, attacking the opponent by surprise before the attack is executed. The a√∫ batido is sometimes also used in doubt or simply as a trick move. This move is also performed in tricking, and for quality, it is also used often in breakdancing where it is known as the L-kick. Names used in different schools may also include Beija Flor (Humming Bird, literally Flower Kiss(er)), Leque (Fan), A√∫ Qu√©brado (also \\"broken cartwheel\\"), A√∫ Malandro(wily cartwheel), A√∫ Amazonas (Amazon cartwheel) or Amazonica. ** A√∫ Batendo-A similar technique, except that the hands generally stay on the ground and the cartwheel is not stopped during the kick, but rather continues over. *A√∫ Fechado‚ÄîFrom esquiva or negativa, the free arm reaches in an arc over the head in the direction of motion. The leg extended furthest from the body leaves the ground first, kicking off and providing momentum. Then the reaching hand is placed on the far side of the body. Bending the arms at the elbows supports weight as both legs pass bent in front of and slightly over the body. While inverted, the body should be closed and maximally protected. One foot touches the ground and then the other. The last step is return to esquiva. *A√∫ sem M√£o‚ÄîAn a√∫ performed without hands in the same manner as the aerial cartwheel. It can be inverted more diagonally to attack in the same way as a butterfly kick or it be used as a floreio. *Au de Frente Also known as volta ao mundo or au cortado. The au de frente starts much like a regular A√∫, but once the legs are off the floor, the hips are turned and the move ends in a front walkover. *A√∫ Giro Sem M√¢o The au giro sem m√¢o aka piao sem mao combines the motions of an au de frente with those of an aerial. The au giro sem m√¢o starts just like Au sem m√¢o, but once the player jumps off with their leg, the opposite arm is driven around and towards the chest to create enough torque for the rotation. The advanced variation is the Au sem mao de frente which is literally a front walkover without hands. File:A√∫.gifA√∫ Aberto File:Au Batido.gifA√∫ Batido File:A√∫zinho.gifA√∫ Fechado File:Au Sem Mao.gifA√∫ sem mao File:Capoeira techniques (animated).gifA√∫ de Frente File:18lc7.gifA√∫ Giro Sem Mao Balan√ßo The balan√ßo of side to side feints done with the torso to deceive the opponent, throw off their timing, and make it harder for them to track the centerline. In a similar manner as a speedskater, the bodyweight is shifted from one leg to the other in a slight lateral hopping/sliding motion while the arms move in a similar fashion as they do during the ginga. The balan√ßo is usually done from the forward ginga and is also known as the Cavalo. As with other movements in capoeira, all types of kicks, handstrikes, or headbutts can be executed unexpectedly from the movement. *P√™ndulo The p√™ndulo resembles more the slipping and bobbing. Whereas the balan√ßo moves side to side, the pendulo is used more to roll and move under attacks. Most of the movement starts from the upper body but also includes dropping with the knees. When the arms are used while the upper body follows the same path as the letter C. The move works really well with incoming fast or direct attacks. Bananeira The bananeira is a handstand in capoeira that derives its name from the banana trees of Brazil. The hands are spread at least shoulder-width apart and the legs are usually together over the capoerista's head. Other variations include having the legs split apart to the side or front. One outlying difference the bananeira has in capoeira is that the face and eyes of the capoeirista are towards the other player; not the ground. While in Bananeira, the feet can be used to defend as well as attack. The bananeira's other uses can be to take a quick break and observe the other player, draw an opponent into a trap, or in the case of contemporary regional schools, show off balance and strength as a floreio. The bananeira is thought to have originated from the use of the handstand by an Nganga (Bantu healers and spiritual leaders) by showing their spiritual connection to the ancestors who walk on their hands in the spirit world. Macaco The macaco is similar to a back handspring with the exception of starting with one hand planted behind the capoeirista and the initial movement starting from a low crouch. The macaco begins by lowering the body down into a low crouch and placing one hand on the floor directly behind the back making contact with the ground. The other hand is thrown over the body while jumping off with both feet to launch the hips straight over the head. This back sweeping movement mirrors the motion that a swimmer adopts when performing a backstroke. As the capoeirista passes into a handstand position, the second hand is placed onto the ground before bringing the first foot makes contact with the ground. The macaco shares visual similarities with the valdez. Variations can include beginning and finishing with the first arm and/or landing with both feet simultaneously. The move is commonly known as the jump of the monkey as the word Macaco literally translates to monkey. *Macaquinho This movement is very similar to the macaco with the exception being that it is lower and less explosive. The knees are in a more forward bent position while one arm is placed directly behind the balls of the feet. Instead of jumping as with the macaco, the capoeirista lowers his/her external oblique onto his elbow and brings his other arm and legs over his head. The macaquinho, translating to little monkey, is a combination of a macaco and queda de rins. *Macaco em P√© Macaco em pe This is a macaco that is done without a hop or crouch. The macaco em p√© resembles the combined motions of a back walkover and a cartwheel. Instead of crouching and jumping, the capoeirista falls backwards onto one arm while bending his back and allowing his hips to go over his head while moving into a standard macaco motion. *Macaco Lateral This is also known as a Xango. It is a standard back handspring. Instead of placing one hand on the ground and flipping over, a leap is made backwards in an arch while extending the hands over the head. This move is used more for entering the roda. Negativa Negativa da Regional lit. negative, refusal or deny. a negativa is used to negate an attack by going low to the ground on one's side, with the leg closest to the ground tucked to the chest, the other extended, supporting one's body weight with the hand, with the upper arm in a location to protect the face. The negativa derrubando used as a sweep which involves hooking the other players supporting leg during a kick. Negativa Rol√™ Rol√™: This 'rolling' motion is - together with the Ginga and the Au - the basic method of moving around in the Roda. This move can be performed from Ginga or from most of the esquivas. It is essentially a spin to one side by the capoeirista while remaining low to the ground and always watching the other player. One of the hallmarks of the move is that during the part where the back is facing the opponent, eye contact is maintained via looking between the legs to watch for an attack. The rol√™ can end easily in roxana, Negativa, or various esquivas. The Rol√™ de Cabe√ßa variation is performed by placing the head on the ground in the middle of the rol√™ so as to be able to transition into various headstand techniques. Troca de P√© Literally Change of Foot, From a Negativa position with the leg extended, a slight hop during which the extended leg becomes the support leg and the guard arm becomes the support arm and vice versa. Ponte The ponte is a bridge with the stomach facing upward and the hands and feet pushing to keep the back arched and off the floor. Most learn to roll into a ponte by turning their legs and hips around first and then inverting into a bridge. The capoeirista can then roll out into a cocorinha, queda de rins, or resistincia for a stylish entrance into a roda. The ponte also doubles as a last resort esquiva although that depends on the player's skill level, style, and speed of the game. Another interesting fact is that Mestre Bimba would give a potential student (aluno) a series of tests before actually teaching them at his academy. One of the tests was a measure of the applicant's natural ability to hold a bridge Queda de Rins The queda de rins (fall on the kidneys) can be used as an esquiva or a launching point for a technique. It involves supporting the torso with the inside elbow and the head, often with the knees resting on the supporting elbow. The head is usually the lowest with the feet and at the highest in a rough 45¬∞ angle. The legs themselves may be together, tuck, split depending on the position. Defensive movements=Cocorinha One of the simplest defense movements. With the feet flat on the ground the player squats with the knees to the chest so as to close the body and covers the side of the torso and head with one hand while the other is flat and to the side for support. Another variation of this involves squatting with the balls of the feet on the ground and arms crossed in front and above the face. Esquiva Literally escape or dodge. Many forms exist but all involve moving the head and torso out of the way of an attack. Esquivas distinguish capoeira from many other martial arts for the simple fact of going along with flow of the attack and releasing an equal or more devastating attack. Many of the attacks in capoeira are fully committed kicks that would cause more injury blocking them instead of dodging them. Blocking attacks upset and imbalance the flow of the game making esquivas more common in rodas. Blocks do sometimes occur when one player is so caught off guard that they are used instinctively. The most common situations being against hand attacks. *Esquiva Baixa Also known as Esquiva de Frente.\\"Low dodge\\", this has the looks of an extremely low ginga. The rear leg and foot are exaggerated and placed even farther back to bring the hips lower to the ground. The torso is bent forward bringing the head even lower. If the left foot is back then the right hand is placed on the floor; the left hand is used to guard the facejig and head. *Esquiva Lateral \\"Side escape\\" or side dodge. It is executed while the feet are in a parallel position. The escape is simply bringing the torso down and to the left or right (depending on the direction of the other player's kick) and reaching the hand over the head The hand can also be placed in front of the face for protection. Some academies will place the hand that is not guarding onto the floor to get even lower. *Esquiva Diagonal This is a dodge that simultaneously dodges and advances forward. Instead of going straight down under an attack or off to the side like in the esquiva lateral or esquiva de frente, the capoeirista steps diagonally of to the left or right of the attack. He/she places his front foot in a perpendicular position to his back foot and crouches down at the knees in a low lunge. The left or right arm comes up to protect the face depending on the direction of the attack while the other arm maintains the body's balance. This is a quite useful esquiva because many counterattacks are available to the player from this position which can include martelos, ganchos, or vingativas saving valuable time. Queda de Quatro One capoeirista uses a queda de quatro to evade a Rabo de Arraia Literally fall of four. Simply fall backwards into a crab-walk position, often followed by scurrying backwards and away from the opponent. Queda de Tres Falling back onto the wrists and one leg. The other leg is up because this position is often \\"forced\\" when the player is taken down from being supported on a single leg. For example: sweeping the base leg of armada leads the fallen player to, hopefully, end in this position. Kicks=Armada An armada is a reverse roundhouse kick, also described as a spinning inside to outside crescent kick. It can be either a Rabo-de-Arraia without the hands supporting on the floor (the head falls below the waist and the kick is executed with the heel), or a Meia lua de Costas (halfmoon from the back), a spinning kick with the body upright. The striking surface is usually the outside blade of the kicking foot. A queixada and armada are executed in exactly the same way with the exception of the armada beginning with a step to the right or left before releasing the kick. The power of the armada actually comes from the torque placed on the hips from the spin. After stepping across the body (to the right or left) at around 45 degrees, the hips are spun while the arms are up to protect from punches or other kicks. Once there is enough torque, the kicking leg is \\"released\\" rather than kicked. This leg goes around in the same motion as a queixada until the kicking leg has finished its arc all the way back or parallel to the other foot. *Armada Pulada An Armada that is released after a jump. The armada pulada begins the same way as the regular armada with the capoeirista turning to the left or right. Once the head, neck and shoulders rotate towards the front, he/she jumps during the release of the armada making it a spinning aerial kick. *Armada Dupla Also known as an Envergado. The distinguishing feature of this move is the fact that both legs remain together during the take off, execution, and landing. Its name, Armada dupla, is derived from this feature and also literally means \\"double armada\\". After the take off, the torso stays upright and vertical, but will begin to quickly torque in order to swing the legs around and upwards. At the peak of this move, the body is in the shape of a \\"V\\". The legs continue to swing over as the body straightens out for the landing. In tricking, this move is called a double leg. Along with the Meia Lua Compasso and Au Malandro/Batida, the armada dupla one of the trademark kicks unique to the art capoeira. *Armada com Martelo The armada com martelo is a spinning double kick beginning with an armada pulada and finishing with a martelo. The capoeirista begins with the same motion of the Armada. While the first leg is raised up, he/she jumps off their back leg. Once the first leg completes its arc, the leg that was jumped off of comes around in the form of a jumping martelo rotado. B√™n√ß√£o An esquiva under a B√™n√ß√£o Literally \\"blessing\\". It is a straight forward frontal push kick. It is commonly aimed at the abdominal or chest area, and the capoeirista hits with either the whole sole of the foot or with the heel. The level of impact varies with its range and intent from a soft tap to an inward jumping stomp to the head, or torso. Chapa Chapa, the sole of the foot, is a generic term for various straight kicks with the sole or heel of the foot. This kick can be used in a roda to push away the other player for distance. These include: *Chapa-de-Costas It resembles a kick from a horse or mule in which both hands are usually on the ground while one of the legs is pushed outward towards the other player. It is a clever attack that can be delivered out of a role towards the groin or knee of the other player. *Chapa-de-Frente A straight kick facing the opponent sometimes performed from a Queda de Quatro, pushing with the hips to gain greater extension. It has the look of a Ben√ßao given from a Queda de Quatro. *Pis√†o Another variation being a side kick. First the player begins by lifting the knee of the kicking leg and hip level of the support leg. The capoeirista turns his supporting foot 180 degrees to the rear while thrusting the kicking foot towards the other player's body. *Chapa Baixa This is a side kick to the lower areas including the thigh, knee, or instep. Impact is usually made with the heel or sole of the foot. As with the pis√†o, the chapa baixa begins with a forward knee raise. However, instead of rising upwards towards the usual kicking targets capoeira (head, chest, stomach), the kick is driven downward towards the other player's lower extremities. It incorporates the malacia in capoeira appearing as a high kick but ending in an unpredictable painful kick to the knee or thigh. In most rodas this is shown rather than completed to full extension. During the later rounds of his title defense in UFC 97 with Thales Leites, Anderson Silva made extensive use of this technique. *Chapa Giratoria Chapa Giratoria Capoeira's answer for the sole kick. It is done in the same way as ban dae yeop chagi in Taekwondo with the capoeirista stepping forward or diagonally while turning his torso. At the same time he raises his back leg up, unleashing it at the apex of the turn in a straight path. Escorpi√£o Scorpion kick There are actually two different versions of the escorpi√£o. The attacking one is very similar to the scorpion kick of other martial arts. It is characterized by kicking backwards, over the head, at a target in front of the kicker impacting with the sole or heel of the foot. The escorpi√£o is very hard to see and is extremely dangerous in the hands of a master. Gancho The gancho lit. hook, is a hook kick. It is a deceptive attack that starts off in the same way as a martelo or roundhouse kick. The knee and thigh of the kicking leg is brought up and across the body in a diagonal direction. Instead of thrusting in and out like a chapa, the leg is extended toward the body and thrust out in a hooking motion striking with the heel or sole. The path of the heel ends near the buttocks and hamstring as it is brought down. There are other ways of using it such as fake martelos into in or from fake chapas. Because of its deceptiveness, the name gancho is perfect for it since it can sometimes act as the hook for a bait attack that is seen far too late. *Gancho Giratoria A spinning version of the gancho. It starts out like a spinning chapa but deceptively lashes out and hooks around in the same manner as the gancho. Martelo The martelo, which literally means \\"hammer\\", is generally defined as a strike with the instep, or lower part of the shin against the opponent's body; the most common target is temple of the head. The most common forms of the Martelo include: *Martelo em P√© Martelo em Pe This is the most common martelo seen in Regional and Contempor√¢nea rodas. Its execution on the very basic level is identical to the sport version of the roundhouse kick commonly seen in Tae Kwon Do and kickboxing. Capoeira emphasizes using kicks anywhere at any time so advance forms of the martelo em pe can come from fakes, skipping and kicking with the front leg, and from other dodges such as the esquiva diagonal. Emphasis is placed on speed and deception rather than knockout. Even with this precaution knockouts still occur due to the weight and sheer force of the leg. *Martelo do Ch√£o Martelo do Chao It is a martelo that starts from the ground. The Martelo do Ch√£o is delivered from a lower position usually right before a rol√© while in esquiva baixa or downward going into a queda de rins. *Martelo de Negativa Martelo de Negativa This is a variation of blends the movements of s dobrado with martelo do ch√£o. The martelo de negativa begins with a hop generating more force since the entire body is used. Other names include chap√©u de couro and s batida. *Martelo Rotado A spinning martelo, similar to a 540 kick. The martelo rotado combines the 540 or parafuso with a martelo. Whereas the parafuso is a spinning outside to inside crescent, the martelo rotado impacts with the instep. Control is sacrificed for power as the leg does not stop, but follows through with a full rotation of the hips. Meia Lua de Compasso The Meia-Lua de compasso (lit: compass half moon) aka. rabo do arria, is an attack that embodies the true element of Capoeira since it combines an evasive maneuver with a spinning kick. The transfer of power begins with the hand slamming into the ground and ending with the spin of the kicking heel. The power of the kick derives its energy from the similar centripetal force of a golf club swing. It has earned its place in capoeira as being called the \\"king of kicks\\". There is even a saying among capoeira mestres on how a capoeirista's general skill level can be determined on how well and fast they are able to execute a Meia lua de compasso. Meia-lua de Frente Meia Lua de Frente (Front Half Moon) is an outside-inside crescent kick seen in other martial arts. This kick involves using the hips to generate enough force to bring the foot of the kicking leg across the face of the player. While it can be used as an attack itself, it mainly is used as a poke or trap for another attack. Other uses for it can be as a combination with cartwheels and other acrobatic moves, therefore, working as an escape. Ponteira Ponteira is the simple front snap-kick with the ball of the foot. It is performed by lifting the knee and quickly extending the leg with toes pulled back while tilting the torso slightly backwards to strike the opponent in the abdomen, chest or face. Contrary to the Ben√ß√£o this is intended as a hard and fast striking kick. Queixada This is one of the most commonly used of the basic kicks in contemporary regional. To execute with the right leg, one begins in mid-ginga stance, with the left leg back and the right forward. From this position, step slightly to the left with the right leg, shifting body weight onto the forward (right) leg while the body faces left. Immediately bring the left leg forward, crossing it behind the right while beginning to throw body weight forward to gain momentum. When the body weight is fully resting on the left leg, release the right leg, kicking it in a large, sweeping arc to the right, keeping the leg straight throughout. When the kick has been completed, the capoeirista is now in mid-ginga stance, except now with the right leg back and the left forward. Throughout this move one must always remember to guard his or her face using the thick part of the forearms (as is done in all capoeira moves). Reverse all directions (left- right and vice versa) in order to execute a queixada with the left leg. Raiz A raiz is a type of kick used in contemporary regional. It could be described as a sideswipe with less rotation, so the practitioner lands on the rear leg from the take off instead of the kicking leg. However, in terms of tricking, the raiz is not a kick, but rather an evasive move aimed to avoid an attack toward the legs. The set-up for the raiz is exactly like the 540 kick, but the technique required for a successful raiz is similar to a Double Leg. In starting this move, the practitioner turns slightly sideways at the waist with the arm-swing motion. Once the set-up is accomplished, the first leg is thrown straight up while having the head thrown back. This motion causes the practitioner's back to become parallel to the ground. The first leg travels around like a Double Leg and the second leg trails behind it. The first leg lands first on the ground and the second leg lags behind. The second leg should not be rushed, but rather be relaxed and let it fall by itself. S-Dobrado The S-Dobrado is the generic name for a series of motions that takes a capoeirista from a low position to whip one leg across the floor in a half circle, then kick up his legs and invert onto his hands and then land back on his feet and stand. The S refers to shape traced by the motion of the leg which leads the move. It is used as a transitional move and there are many variations of the S-Dobrado. A basic S-Dobrado can start from a Negativa, whip the straight leg around in a half circle to face the other direction, kick up into a Macaco. Another variation involves going from Corta Capim, then kicking up into Macaco. While inverted, the capoeirista can Au, or stop and do a Bananeira, or even sink down into a Queda De Rins. It is a very versatile technique for a capoeirista. V√¥o-do-Morcego Literally translated as the \\"Flight of the bat\\". This is a flying kick done sideways with both legs. It is executed virtually in the same manner as a dropkick; however, the knees are drawn back in after making contact and one lands on their feet. It would be ridiculous to perform this in the same way as pro wrestlers since landing on the ground would injure the capoeirista more than the kick. Since it is an aerial attack, balance and control are sacrificed for raw power. As with any attack, the effectiveness of this attack depends on the timing, weight, and body mass. It was a very popular attack in past times, but it is rarely seen in rodas today. In the anime series Afro Samurai, Afro utilizes this kick against his opponents in season 2 although it is not specified where he learned this kick. Hand and arm strikes Jogo de Bra√ßos or \\"the game of the arm and hand\\". Traditionally, hand strikes were rarely used in capoeira, the mythological reasoning behind this being that the shackles and chains of the slaves prevented this. Even if this is so, punches, elbows, and slaps have always existed in street rodas all around Brazil. Today, this game of the arm and hand is seen more in the Capoeira Angola rodas. Some players attempt to distract or fascinate their opponent by waving their arms and hands in a spellcasting like way. This jogo or game represents a swinging and waving of hands to diminish any perception of an attack and lower the other player's guard.Nestor Capoeira (2002) Roots of the Dance-Fight-Game, Revised Ed. North Atlantic Books. pg 30 . Asfixiante While the literal translation of this is based on suffocation or rather the act of it, the asfixiante is a straight punch thrown with either hand. Taking clues from its name, the target may have originally been the throat instead of the face. Cutelo The Cutelo, also known as Cutilada de Mao, is a knifehand strike attack. It is applied in the same way as the generic karate chop usually to the face, temple, or base of the neck. The arc of travel for the cutelo usually begins on the outside to inside combining a backhand attack with a knifehand. The cutelo is not as present in rodas as it once was. Cotovelada The cotovelada is an elbow strike usually from outside to inside. In all forms of martial arts, range plays a very important role. When two capoeristas are playing a close aggressive game it would be foolish to throw a kick or punch at such a close range. The cotovelada is a quick surprise attack when things get too close. Ths strike can really hurt if performed right Dedeira An attack to the eyes that reveals the street fighting origins of capoeira. It is rarely executed in rodas today because of the harm it can cause. It is an eyepoke with the index and middle finger of the attacking hand. This attack was usually done to disorientate the target for a quick escape or in some cases, rob them. In most capoeira rodas, the Dedeira will be shown, but never fully executed. When combined with the element of surprise, the dedeira was a very useful ambush weapon. Galopante The galopante is more of a slap than a punch. The capoeirista strikes the side of the opponents face or ear with his open hand in a swinging motion. In most cases the galopante is not meant to cause much damage to the opponent. It is instead used as a distraction or to tell the opponent that his guard is too open. However, it is a handslap that follows the same trajectory and principles of a hook punch using the body's core making it just as damaging in the right \\"hands\\". Godeme Backhand strike, normally to the face. The hand can made into a fist making it a backfist or done openhanded as a slap. When swinging, the arms are relaxed making the strike faster and the sting more painful. The godeme is obviously an aggressive attack. According to Capoeira lore, the move was named when Mestre Bimba was sparring with some Americans. He was establishing the names they had for various techniques when performed this strike to the head to his partner, who responded with a hearty \\"God damn!\\" which Mestre Bimba assumed was their name for it. While the error was explained to him afterwards, he liked the name enough to retain it. Telefone An attack with both hands slapping the opponent's ears at the same time. This attack is used rarely in the roda as it is considered too aggressive. The telefone is very painful and disorienting because of the sudden burst of air pressure entering the ear canal. It is possible for this attack, if done in a malicious way, to cause permanent damage to the eardrum. Its name is a use of wordplay based on a telephone call. Head butts=Arp√£o de Cabe√ßa This is a headbutt that involved the capoeirista throwing his full body into the headbutt. While the cabe√ßda can be seen as playful, this is its more violent cousin. By usually ducking under a kick or punch, the player will spring forward with full force targeting the head, stomach, or groin. Cabe√ßada The Cabe√ßada (pronounced: ka-be-SA-da, lit.: head butt) is an offensive movement of Capoeira in which the attacker pushes the opponent with his head or forehead. Generally a cabe√ßada is performed when the opponent is executing an open au (cartwheel) but can be performed against any move where the belly of an opponent is exposed. A less playful version of this technique is when instead of the forehead both elbows are pushed into the defender's abdomen. Another variation on this technique involves first entering a push-up like position but with the hips raised the head is then thrust forward into the target. This is usually used when both players are on the ground. Escorumelo This is a less playful headbutt that moves in an upward direction. The head goes under the attack and comes up hitting the bottom of the chin. This gives it the same application as an uppercut combined with the weight of the entire body rising along with the head. Takedowns Takedowns are normally considered a bit aggressive in capoeira, and attempting a takedown might be seen as a test of one's skills. However, the frequency of takedowns in the roda varies from group to group and type of game. One situation where takedowns are common, is during the Batizado ceremony. This is when the Mestre (Master) gives the new students their first cord√£o, or the senior students their next cord according to their progression in capoeira. In such a ceremony, the mestre(s) will try to take his students down, sometimes several times during a game. In the same manner of a baptism of going underwater and emerging a new person, the takedown of a novice is seen as bring them down and them rising as a new baptized capoeirista. Due to the strong emphasis on kicking, the most common takedowns in capoeira are sweeps; however, there are also other takedowns utilizing the hands, arms, legs or shoulders to push, lift, or even throw the opponent to the ground. A√ßoite-de-Bra√ßo This throw is rarely seen. Its use was a more designed for self-defense. If an attacker was approaching the capoeirista from behind using a club or cheap punch, the capoeirista would duck under the attack simultaneously scooping the leg of the attacker up. He would continue the motion, the attacker off of his shoulders and slamming him to the ground. The closest throw to this is the kata guruma also seen in judo. The above version is found in the books by Nestor Capoeira; however, in the original Regional style of Mestre Bimba, Acoite de Braco (lit. arm whip) is a shoulder throw similar to ippon seoi nage in judo ‚Äì capoeirista grasps one arm of his opponent with both hands, turns around and throws him over the back. Arrast√£o Classic leg takedown. The capoeirista grabs the opponent behind the knees and pulls/lifts while pushing the opponent backwards with their shoulder, driving him to the ground. While seen as a double leg takedown, in many situations it will change to a single leg takedown. Ironically in the evolution of things, this move is usually countered with a sprawl or even a guillotine choke depending on the school or academy. An alternate technique used by some groups is for the capoeirista to take the opponent down laterally, as opposed to a football-tackle style takedown. Using their head to push the opponent's hips sideways, forcing the opponent to balance upon one leg, the capoeirista then uses their arms to sweep the remaining leg from underneath the opponent, completing the takedown. The opponent's legs should be swept so that they land in front of the capoeirista's legs instead of in between, for defensive reasons. Upon discovery of this takedown, some casual viewers learn to see capoeira as more than a recreational \\"dance\\". thumb Bal√£o de Lado  Bal√£o de Lado  In this takedown, the capoerista wraps the opponent's head with an arm from behind and bends over, lifting the opponent and rotating the body to throw him to the ground. This technique resembles the koshi guruma taught in judo.  Banda  Banda is a sweep kick, the objective of which is to pull one of the opponent's feet making him lose his balance and fall. It usually is performed from a standing position. What separates the banda from the rasteira is that the sweep is mostly done with the heel of the foot instead of the instep. * Banda de Costa Banda de Costa A defensive counter-attack performed against a kick. This is usually reserved for circular kicks such as the armada or queixada. By following the motion of the kick, the capoeirista steps to the outside of the kicker and uses one hand to push them forward while the closest leg reaps the supporting leg of the kicker. It looks identical to the osoto guruma in judo. *Banda de Dentro The banda de dentro or passa pe is a similar sweep as the rasteira em pe. While the banda de costa focuses on sweeping the kicking leg from the inside instead. While one capoeirista is delivering a kick such as a martelo, the other player steps inside and sweeps the supporting leg in an inside to outside motion. *Banda Tracada A basic move in which the user sweeps the opponent's leg with his foot, especially in midst of performing a bigger movement. It is similar to the harai tsurikomi ashi from judo. Boca de Cal√ßa A takedown executed by grabbing the opponent's pant legs or ankles and pulling. *Boca de Cal√ßa de Costas A version of the Boca de Cal√ßa that involves turning your back, reaching between your legs, and pulling the other player down by his ankles or cuffs. It is usually done crouching under a kick and pulling the supporting ankle of the leg not extended through the capoeirista's leg. This is not as easy as it sounds because of the timing involved. Many who see this coming would go for a rear naked choke by hopping onto the capoeirista's back. A dangerous counter to this is a jump backwards ensuring the person applying the choke receives the blunt force of the ground. Corta Capim  Corta Capim  Literally \\"Grass Cutter\\" this sweep is done largely as a counter. The capoeirista drops beneath the kick and brings the knife edge of his/or her foot across into the attacker's ankle or instep. this technique is rarely performed with any real force. It is more used to show what could have been done. The movement is identical to the Coffee Grinder movement in breakdancing.  Cruz  This is another example of a takedown in capoeira that uses the attack against the attacker. When a straight kick such as a chapa or benc√£o is thrown towards the capoeirista, he simply ducks under the attack. After ducking under the kick, he catches and traps the kicking leg with his back( Trapezius muscle and shoulders) and outstretched arms forming a cross. By standing up (or in some cases jumping) with the kicking leg trapped along the blades of his shoulder, he provides the leverage necessary to knock his attacker to the ground.  Negativa Derrubando  While in a negativa, the front foot slips behind the heel of the other opponent. After catching the pull of the leg along with the instep hooking the heel should cause the player to fall backwards. Paulista Much like the rasteira, the paulista is a sweep that uses the instep. However, instead of sweeping with the outside leg, the inside leg is used. Rasteira Rasteira A Rasteira is a movement in capoeira used to sweep or pull an opponent's leg in response to a kick. There are generally four different types: rasteira do ch√£o, rasteira em p√©, rasteira de costa, and rasteira com mao. Many mestres agree that the rasteira is a true embodiment of what capoeira really is. Instead of meeting the kick with a block, the rasteira follows the same direction of the attack turning the opponent's force and confidence against himself. The theory being that the more committed to the attack a player is, the harder they will fall from a rasteira, e.g. When one player kicks with an armada, a well placed rasteira to the supporting leg will make him/her lose their balance and fall. One crucial point to remember is that timing is everything when employing a rasteira. A player just beginning his/her attack is easier to trip verses one whom is firmly planted. *Rasteira do Ch√£o This is the most common form of a rasteira characterized by its long extension of the hooking leg, use of one or two hands for balance, and lower center of gravity. The capoeirista moves under the incoming kick, hooks the opponent's standing heel or ankle with his instep and pulls it in a straight motion. The rasteira do ch√£o allows the capoeirista to use the muscles in the torso as well as his body weight for more leverage, making it a much stronger takedown. It takes a little longer to execute than a rasteira em p√© making them more suitable for medium to high spinning kicks and/or when playing games of benguela or angola. *Rasteira em P√© Rasteira em pe against a martelo Much like the rasteira above, this movement is virtually the same with a few differences. While the rasteira do ch√£o is used more for circular attacks, the rasteira em p√© is more suitable for quicker or direct attacks such as the martelo or in faster games. The capoeirista does not crouch as low when hooking his foot around the supporting leg of the other kicker with the power coming more from the step vs the torso. This version of the rasteira allows for a much faster execution. *Rasteira de Mao This version makes use of the hand. Sometimes in a close game when using the leg requires too much time and energy, this is used instead. While going along with the motion of the kick, the capoeirista ducks under the kick, grabs the supporting leg, and pulls it leg with his/her hand towards him/her in the same direction as a rasteira using the instep. *Rasteira de Costa Rasteira de Costa A rasteira de costa is a departure from the pulling motion seen in previous versions rasteiras. It is more of a spinning back sweep kick that moves in a half circle with the sweeping leg aimed more for the ankle of the supporting leg. Instead of pulling, the impact from the heel is what causes the other player to fall. This takedown can be seen in other martial art disciplines such as Kung Fu, Hapkido, Pencak Silat, and Kajukenbo. The rasteira de costa can be used against a spinning attack or an opponent that has a more linear fighting stance. Tesoura Tesoura lit. scissors, aka. Tesoura de Costa, is a scissor takedown wrapping one leg over the front of the opponent's body near the stomach with the other behind both knees, and then twisting one's own body in the direction the players wants the opponent to fall; usually on their back. It is virtually identical to a kani basami. *Tesoura de Frente A variation of the Tesoura (scissors) that targets the legs instead of the torso. The tesoura de Frente moves in low, hooking the outside leg with the calf of one leg while simultaneously using the knee of the other leg to trap to the opponent's inner thigh with the knee. With a small amount of effort, the capoeirista rotates his torso away from his opponent using the trapped knee as a lever, knocking the opponent off balance. This move requires a high level finesse and timing. *Tesoura Angola Commonly performed from negativa or queda-de-rins, the capoeirista goes to a prone position, legs facing the opponent and scissored out, hips twisted to protect the groin, supporting themselves on their hands and toes. They then advance upon the opponent by pushing themselves along with their hands, watching by craning their neck over one shoulder, threatening a tesoura de frente. The opponent is expected to escape, traditionally via an a√π or by diving over the attacking capoeirist, possibly going into their own Tesoura Angola upon landing. A more daring escape can be performed by traveling under the attacking capoeirista, optionally striking them with an escorpi√£ you pass under them. Tombo-de- Ladeira Meaning the Tumbling Slope, AKA, Jo√£o Pequeno (named for Mestre Jo√£o Pequeno who is known for making the move popular). In Capoeira Angola it is a kick from out of an au when one of the legs comes down as an axe kick. The Tombo de Ladeira can also be performed from Rol√™ position (Queda de Tr√™s). It is most effective when the opponent's head is low to the ground. According to Nestor Capoeira, Tombo-de-Ladeira is a takedown in which one takes advantage of an opponent using an aerial or close to aerial attack or movement by standing up from beneath them. Needless to say, it is dangerous for both parties involved. Vingativa A low takedown that involves stepping forward and trapping the back legs of an opponent that is in a side stance. The capoeirista also protects his face with his elbow. Once the lead leg of the capoeirista has trapped the leg of the opponent, he shifts the weight in his hips forward and up. If the contact is maintained with the legs the other player then he should be thrown up and away. Although this move originally came from batuque, it has similar appearances as some throws/sweeps in Baguazhang, as well as the tai otoshi done in some styles of karate. Other schools teach a variation which resembles more the sukui nage or obi otoshi found in judo. Floreios Floreios can refer to two things: a) The complex movements in the ginga of capoeira Angola used as feints, stylistic variations, etc. b) Acrobatic movements in contemporary regional, sometimes in capoeira Angola, that aren't generally considered offensive or defensive in a game. These include: Bandeira Bandeira is an advanced capoeira combination in which the player performs a fast cartwheel which is immediately followed by a side flip. This move can be often seen in capoeira regional roda. Folha Seca A Folha Seca lit.dry leaf is very similar to a Flash Kick. The direction k with the capoeirista kicking with more of a slant in his body during the rotation. After turning at least 90 degrees to the left or right, the capoerista raises his kicking leg up while jumping off of his support leg. He brings his arms up while hollowing out his back. He continues the kick until he lands on his kicking leg. *Folha Seca helic√≥ptero A hyped variation of the folha seca in which a quick change of legs is done in mid air and is landed on the non-kicking leg. In this move, right after the take off, the kicking leg swings over and around the non-kicking leg creating a helicopter like motion. *Chute na lua A Chute na lua lit.kick to the moon is a combination of a Flash Kick and gainer. While it can commonly be linked to an S-dobrado, it can also be performed out of nowhere. After pivoting on the non- kicking leg, the kicking leg is swung straight through and up. Both arms are raised and the back is hallowed out. The kicking legs is kept straight while the non-kicking leg is bent. The kicking leg continues all the way around until the capoeirista lands on it. Rel√≥gio The relogio has similar mechanics as the hand glide in B-boying. The main exception to the rule is that the body is resting on the kidneys in a more lateral manner with the body facing to the side. The entry into a relogio usually begins in the same way as a rol√©. The body turns as both hands touch the ground. One hand is lifted as the body is rested on the elbow of the arm in contact with the ground. The spin point is the small portion of the carpus (same as the 1990 or piao de mao), so that there is a minimal amount of friction between the hand and the ground. While the relogio is a floeiro it can also be a sweep depending on the timing. Pi√£o de M√£o A hand spin that is done in a very similar way as the 1990 in breakdancing. The capoeirista begins by turning his body in the same manner as a meia lua de compasso. By generating enough torque, he raises his leg which is the opposite the hand he places down. Keeping the weight of the entire body focused on the outer lower portion of his palm, the capoeirista can keep the circular momentum spin going by lowering the amount of friction between his hand and the surface simultaneously alternating hands during the spins. The variations and ending positions for this move are virtually limitless. Pi√£o de Cabe√ßa It is a headspin in capoeira. There are numerous ways of executing this technique. One of them being, after going down into a queda de rins, the capoeirista brings his legs and hip over until all of his weight is on his head and shoulders. By twisting his hips and legs around in a counter clockwise/clockwise fashion, the body's core develops torque. After releasing his/her hands from the ground, the capoeirista will spin for 180 up to 720 degrees around (depending on his/skill level and balance). One rule of thumb is that the capoeirista begins this move facing the other player. This particular move has been a subject of debate in the ongoing argument of capoeira influencing being the direct predecessor of breakdancing. Carpado Also known as a Mortal. It is essentially some kind of flip. This is one of the many movements that separates Capoeira Regional from its grounded sister, Capoeira Angola. Capoeira is known for its acrobatics and the mortal is one of its many indicators. Always depending on the toque of the game and sometimes group, a mortal can be done at almost any time during the game. Since many capoeiristas see the game of capoeira as an interacting physical dialogue between two bodies, the mortal's place in capoeira is well received depending on its timing. Most mortals are done during the entrance into a roda with a fast-paced game. With so many dynamic movements in capoeira, a mortal is done from almost any spinning kick or au. With all things in capoeira, there is some debate over the \\"overuse\\" of mortals and other flips as some see them as only shallow movements that take away from the effectiveness of the martial art. *Salto This is a generic term for a back somersault. Usually, but not limited to, entering into rodas and solos during performances. After executing a round off and back handspring (xango), the player jumps up while raising both his arms and knees. He/she continues over until landing on both feet. The variation that capoeira is known for is the landing on one foot. *Mortal de Frente Mariposa The mariposa is not a butterfly kick, but rather a Butterfly twist. While there are many entrances into the spin (for example, a capoeirista could enter into the movement with a folha secca and then continue with the movement, which is more commonly called a corkscrew), it is commonly seen as a complete 360 spin of the body while it is horizontal in the air. Debate has surfaced on when this first appeared. In the final fight scene in Only the Strong, kung-fu artist Marc Dacascos executes this as his finishing move against the other fighter. Since then, the mariposa has been spotted in rodas all over the world. Helic√≥ptero Helicoptero kick A helicoptero is an A√∫ with a circular movement of the legs, like a helicopter. The technique starts off as a regular au, but when the body is inverted (both legs are off the ground), a twist of the legs is done so that the leg that left the ground second lands on the ground first. This technique can be combined with the \\"master swipe\\" from tricking to add more spin and make the move more aesthetic. The master swipe is a cartwheel where the inside leg leaves the ground first in contrast to the outside leg from a regular cartwheel Armada Dupla Armada Dupla is one of the signature moves of capoeira. It is performed as an un-tucked side flip with legs forming a 90-degree angle. Unlike the side flip, this move doesn't use the tucking motion to get the rotation. Instead, it is done by jumping upwards and torquing your body. At one point, your legs will simply follow through with the momentum of your body and drive you around.

The regulations came into effect on 6 April 2007, and were amended by the Localism Act 2011, taking effect from 6 April 2012. The Deregulation Act 2015 further amended the regulations from 26 March 2015. Reasons for introduction It is common for landlords to take a dilapidation deposit from a tenant at the start of the tenancy. The deposit acts as a safeguard should the tenant cause any damage to the property. Some unscrupulous landlords are either very slow to return deposits at the end of the tenancy or make unfair deductions. The purpose of the regulations is to ensure good practice in this area, and try to keep disputes between landlords and tenants out of the courts by encouraging alternative dispute resolution. Description The tenant pays over the deposit (commonly one month's rent) in the usual way when the tenancy agreement is signed. The landlord or letting agency has 30 days from receipt of the deposit to provide the tenant with details of the scheme that they are using (known as the prescribed information). If there is no dispute at the end of the tenancy the deposit will be returned to the two parties as agreed. If a dispute has arisen then the parties will be invited to make use of the alternative dispute resolution process that is provided free within the scheme. Should the parties opt for alternative dispute resolution they will be bound by its decision with no redress to the courts. There are two types of protection scheme: ‚Äì Custodial-based ‚Äì Insurance-based There are three companies providing these schemes. These are: The Tenancy Deposit Scheme My Deposits Deposit Protection Service The Custodial schemes are free to use and the landlord or letting agents can simply pay the deposit online or over the phone. The money is held in a bank account by the Scheme and transferred directly to the tenant once both parties agree on the total sum of money to release. When the deposit is under an insurance-based scheme, the landlord or the letting agent will hold the deposit, but have to pay a fee to ensure the landlord will not illegally retain the deposit at the end of the tenancy. If at the end of the tenancy the landlord does not release the deposit, the insurance will pay back the tenant. The Tenancy Deposit Scheme is a not for profit company and has a wide range of useful information on its website (www.tenancydepositscheme.com). Schemes three companies are authorised by the UK government to run tenancy deposit schemes: *The Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS) *MyDeposits *The Deposit Protection Service (The DPS) TDS was the original tenancy deposit scheme - established in 2003 which many agents and landlords volunteered to use prior to the introduction of the legislation. TDS is the only not-for-profit government approved tenancy deposit scheme in the UK. Initially, the DPS offered only a custodial scheme while TDS and MyDeposits offered only an insurance-backed scheme. From April 2013, the DPS also offered an insurance-backed scheme, and from April 2016, the TDS and MyDeposits both started offering a custodial scheme. Between April and September 2013, Capita also operated an insurance-backed scheme. Deposit protected by Capita was subsequently transferred to MyDeposits. Enforcement If a landlord or letting agent does not both protect a tenant‚Äôs deposit and provide the tenant with the prescribed information within 30 days then they are prevented from regaining possession of the property under a Section 21 notice under the Housing Act 1988, unless the deposit is first repaid or proceedings for a penalty against the landlord, or its agent, has been initiated and settled. If the tenant applies to court for the deposit to be protected and it is shown the landlord is not compliant with the scheme, then the court must order the landlord to pay the tenant between one and three times the deposit amount within 14 days. Non-protection of a deposit taken before the commencement of the regulations on 6 April 2007 does not result in a penalty, but no valid Section 21 notice may be served until the deposit has been protected. Pre-2012 cases * Tiensia v Vision Enterprises Ltd \\\\- deposit registered after 14-day deadline * Gladehurst Properties Ltd v Hashemi - deposit never registered during tenancy * Draycott v Hannels - deposit registered after 14-day deadline * Harvey v Bamforth - deposit registered within 14 days but information not provided The defences in these cases are affected by the Localism Act 2011, which made the following changes to the law affecting deposit registration: * Deadline for registration and providing prescribed information changed from 14 to 30 days following payment of the deposit * Penalties for non-compliance apply even if the registration is done late * Grants the court discretion to award 1x to 3x the deposit amount as a sanction, instead of 3x in all cases * The penalties for non-compliance apply even once the tenancy has ended Claims process Either a Landlord or a tenant may begin the claims process from 14 days after the end of the tenancy.Deposit Protection Service Retrieved October 2011 The first step in beginning a claim is to obtain a so-called Statutory Declaration by accessing the Landlord or tenant's online account, and starting the process using an online form. Once a claim has begun, the dispute service in question makes contact with both parties notifying them of the dispute, and requesting any additional evidence, before the claim is referred to an alternative dispute resolution service, unless either party states that they do not wish to use the ADR service or notifies in writing that they wish to resolve the dispute in the county courts, or alternatively another dispute resolution service. Localism Act 2011 The Housing Act left open a loophole for landlords and letting agents. Although there was a penalty for not protecting the deposit or issuing prescribed information, there was no penalty for not doing so within the original 14 day limit. To close this loophole, the Localism Act 2011 extended the time limit for protecting tenancy deposits from 14 to 30 days, and this limit became absolute. Therefore, on the 31st day after the payment of the deposit money to the landlord the tenant can make an application to the court if the money has not been protected and the prescribed information given. Even if the deposit is registered or the prescribed information is given at any time after the 30-day window the tenant still has a right to make a claim. The claim will be for the return of the full sum of the deposit along with a penalty of between one and three times the sum of the deposit, to be awarded at the discretion of the Court. Tenants can also now make an application to a county court for a penalty award after the tenancy has ended.The Tenancy Deposit Scheme http://www.tds.gb.com/resources/files/The%20Housing%20Act%202004%20and%20the%20changes%20introduced%20by%20the%20Localism%20Act%202011.pdf Alternatives There are a number of ‚Äúno deposit‚Äù or ‚Äúzero deposit‚Äù schemes in operation that are provided by insurance companies. These can offer landlords protection without having to take a deposit. Bond schemes are an alternative for those unable to afford a deposit. They are commonly used as a homelessness prevention measure.

He was the co-chair of the Religion and Socialism Commission of the Democratic Socialists of America. He was based in metropolitan Boston, Massachusetts. He fathered 10 children with his wife, Helen Haye Cort, and he cantored in his local parish until his death. Biography John Cyrus Cort was born in Woodmere, New York, on December 3, 1913, to Ambrose Cort, a school teacher, and Lydia (Painter) Cort. He attended a public school in Hempstead, New York, for seven years. Raised Episcopal, he attended the choir school of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City from the age of 10. He completed his secondary education at the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut. After graduating from Harvard College cum laude in 1935 and converting to Catholicism, Cort was moved by a speech by Dorothy Day in May 1936. The novel Moon Gaffney, by Harry Sylvester, was dedicated to Cort and Day. He was one of the earliest Catholic Workers who started at the Mott Street House in 1936. He worked with the Catholic Worker for a few years. He helped found the Association of Catholic Trade Unionists and for several years he edited their periodical, the Labor Leader. He served on the editorial staff of Commonweal magazine from 1943 to 1959. In the early 1960s he was a regional director of the Peace Corps in the Philippines, and was appointed by Governor Endicott Peabody as the director of the Massachusetts Commonwealth Service Corps. In the 1970s he directed the Model Cities Program in Lynn, Massachusetts, and administered a number of Great Society social programs in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cort married Helen Haye in 1946. Cort wrote several books and articles for magazines. He was the founding editor of the Religion and Socialism Commission's Religious Socialism magazine. He contributed to the American Friends Service Committee's Peacework magazine. He was described as \\"personally conservative but socially and politically radical, well-read but never pedantic, funny, chivalrous, of broad culture but a man of the people.\\" Unlike most Catholic Workers, John Cort was not a pacifist, but he did oppose the Vietnam War using just war theory. Cort died August 3, 2006, in Nahant, Massachusetts, and was buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Nahant. Cort's papers are housed at the American Catholic History Research Center and University Archives at the Catholic University of America.

Starci na chmelu (The Hop Pickers; also known as Hop Side Story and Green Gold) is a light examination of adolescent morality and bureaucracy about a group of pre-teen boys and girls picking hops under school supervision. One boy (Vladim√≠r Pucholt) builds a secret hideaway in an attic. When a schoolgirl (Ivana Pavlov√°) finds him in his retreat, puppy-love blossoms, but a jealous classmate (Milo≈° Zavadil) tells the teacher (Irena Kaƒç√≠rkov√°) about the two friends, and they are suspended from school. The boy and girl accept their punishment and form an even stronger bond. The two leave the school together while their classmates ostracize the jealous informant. D√°ma na kolej√≠ch (Lady on the Tracks) is a musical comedy about a streetcar driver in Prague (Ji≈ôina Bohdalov√°) who mounts a campaign for women's rights when she discovers her husband's love affair. Music Clips Rychman is also considered a key figure in the development of early Czech music videos. 1958's \\"D√°me si do bytu\\" (\\"Let's get to the apartment\\") differs in style to earlier musical films such as Bessie Smith's St. Louis Blues, in that the narrative is contained within the song and not extrapolated out into a longer form story.

Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's visit in 1947 to Noakhali, it has applied the Gandhian philosophy of rural development, peace and social harmony to uplift living conditions of the rural poor, especially women, in that area. It has a two-pronged approach to developmental and charitable activities. Initially set up by the original owner of the premises (Barrister Hemanta Kumar Ghose) that were subsequently gifted to GAT, the Ambika Kaliganga Charitable Trust had carried out charitable functions and started working for the 1946 riot victims of Noakhali. Under Pakistani rule, the Trust could not continue its activities due to the policies of the then government. After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, with the emergence of the Gandhi Ashram Trust in 1975, there was a shift in the vision and mission of the Trust. Development and extension services for the poor and disadvantaged were taken along with charitable functions. Currently, the main focus of Gandhi Ashram Trust is the development of better standards of living, both material and eternal. It is working at the 5 district in Southern part of Bangladesh.

She was an Anishinaabeg Elder of the Crane Clan. She was born in Michigan around 1919 and spent time on Garden Island, a traditional Anishinaabeg homeland. Biography According to her biography, Keewaydinoquay was born in a fishing boat en route to the hospital from the Manitou Islands, which capsized shortly thereafter, and her survival was interpreted as miraculous. Her childhood name, meaning \\"Walks with Bears\\", derived from an incident where as a toddler she was left on a blanket as her parents gathered blueberries, returning to see her standing by bears, eating blueberries off the bushes. Her adult name Giiwedinokwe, recorded as \\"Keewaydinoquay\\", means \\"Woman of the North[west Wind]\\" and came from her vision quest. She apprenticed with the noted Anishinaabeg medicine woman Nodjimahkwe from the age of 9 and worked for many years as a medicine woman, at a time when her people had little access to conventional medical care and when conventional medical care failed to cure them, healing more than several patients deemed to be terminally ill. At the age of 57 she decided to study anthropology, realizing that people would listen to her more if she had a degree. She received a Master of Education Degree from Wayne State University, and had finished all course work for a Ph.D. in ethnobotany at the University of Michigan. She was awarded the Michigan Conservation Teacher of the Year in 1975 for her \\"Outstanding Work in the Field of Conservation\\". She taught classes in ethnobotany as well as philosophy of the Great Lakes American Indians at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee where she was a professor in the 1980s, and lectured at many herbal conferences. She was consulted for many prestigious books, including several on Great Lakes indigenous plant use. She lived in Ann Arbor, Milwaukee, Leland, and most notably at her heart's home, Garden Island. She was the author of numerous books on herbs, Native American medicine and rare legends for children and adults. Keewaydinoquay founded the Miniss Kitigan Drum, a non-profit organization supporting the preservation and evolution of Great Lakes Native American traditions. Many referred to Keewaydinoquay lovingly as Nookomis (Grandmother). The group has ties with established and recognized tribes in the area. She was the subject of controversy, much of it stemming from her willingness to teach those of other than native backgrounds. She started doing this at a time when native people had just secured their abilities to openly practice traditional ceremonial rites and religious observances. Kee said it \\"broke her heart\\" that she could find no Native peoples interested in learning about their own culture, and she offered her teachings to non-natives as the only way of preserving her heritage. She said to critics that the time was late, and that people of good hearts and like minds needed to work together to offset the users and those that were actively hurting the earth. Some other elders at the time affirmed the wisdom of this, and later many who had earlier criticized her came to appreciate the wisdom of these teachings and proclaim them themselves. She died on July 21, 1999 and was honored with a traditional Midewiwin ceremony on Garden Island. In March 2002, the Holy Hill Trust of Leland was awarded a Michigan Humanities Council grant to develop a book tentatively titled \\"The LifeStory of Keewaydinoquay\\". A book covering her childhood was published by the University of Michigan Press in 2006 and was named one of the Notable Books of Michigan in 2007. The final title of this first book is \\"Keewaydinoquay, Stories From My Youth\\". The second book telling about her adult life was supported by another grant from the Michigan Humanities Council.

Called a \\"master of children's wordplay\\" by ALA Booklist and \\"Mr. English for Kids\\" by the Children's Book-of-the-Month Club, he has written over 35 books for young readers, most of them about the English language. He is Scholastic's \\"Professor Grammar.\\" Marvin Terban now teaches at Columbia Grammar and Prep, teaching students Latin.  Life and career  Terban was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and began his career as an author with a book that he wrote and drew in the first grade about a fuzzy green dragon. His first real writing job was a weekly column for his local newspaper when he was in high school. He was also the editor of his high school newspaper and literary magazine. He went to Tufts and Columbia Universities, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees respectively. For over fifty years, he has taught English, Latin, Public Speaking, Computer, Theater, and other subjects at the Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City. Early in his teaching career, Terban took a break to work with schools in the tri-state NYC area who were using educational television in their classes. Returning to his own classroom with renewed energy, he developed teaching games that used humor to help students understand and enjoy the mystifying idiosyncrasies of the English language. Those games grew into the highly original series of funny books on English for which he is known. Terban's humorous books on language arts skills and wordplay are used in schools all over the United States and abroad. They have even made it as far as Shanghai University in China, where they are used to teach English to adults. His Scholastic Dictionary of Idioms has been translated into Japanese and Korean. Two of his books were turned into early computer games. He and his wife Karen, a former special education instructor, also wrote two activity books for teachers. Three of his Scholastic books, Checking Your Grammar, Dictionary of Idioms, and Dictionary of Spelling, have sold well over one million copies each. In 2005, the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, an international organization of over 30,000 creators of children's books, voted Mr. Terban their Member of the Year for his many contributions to the Society and children's literacy.

He most recently played in the Elitserien for Bryn√§s IF. He is currently coaching IF Sundsvall in the Swedish Allsvenskan. He is the father of Anaheim Ducks defenseman Christian Djoos. Djoos was drafted in the 7th round (127th overall) by Detroit in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. Professional career Djoos grew up playing hockey for his hometown team in Sweden. His solid defensive play earned him local fame and looks from pro scouts. Djoos was drafted in 1986 by the Detroit Red Wings while still playing on his local hockey team. The Red Wings organization felt it best for him to gain more experience in Sweden before coming to America, and so Djoos remained in Sweden. He was called up to Bryn√§s IF of the Swedish Elite League in 1988 and remained with the team for two seasons, scoring 18 points each season. The Red Wings wanted to see how his skills would translate into the North American game and so Djoos was brought over to America for the 1990‚Äì91 season. He ended up playing for the Adirondack Red Wings of the American Hockey League, but only managed to play 20 games before being called up to the big leagues. Djoos played 26 games for the injury ridden Red Wings, before being traded on March 5, 1991. Djoos was traded, along with Joe Kocur, to the New York Rangers for Kevin Miller, Jim Cummins and Dennis Vial, where he was sent to the Rangers' minor league club, the Binghamton Rangers, for the remainder of the season. Djoos helped lead Binghamton into the playoffs, eventually losing in the semi-finals. In the 1991‚Äì92 season, Djoos played 50 games for the New York Rangers, picking up one goal and 40 penalty minutes. The following season, Djoos found himself back in the minors with Binghamton, where he had his best season to date, scoring 16 goals and 53 assists in 70 games. He also added 10 points in Binghamton's short playoff run. Djoos would also see his last of the NHL in the 1992‚Äì93 season, when he was called up to New York for six games, scoring one goal and one assist in that span. International play After finishing his career in North America, P√§r headed back across the Atlantic to play for Lugano of the Nationalliga A. Djoos again had a great season and helped Lugano in their short playoff run with 7 assists. 1994‚Äì95 would see Djoos back in the SEL playing for V√§stra Fr√∂lunda HC G√∂teborg.

It was a hit single for Canadian-born actor Lorne Greene in 1964. It reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard charts on December 5, 1964, as well as garnering the same spot on the \\"Easy Listening\\" chart, where it retained the position for six weeks. The single also peaked at #21 on the Hot Country Singles chart. In Canada, it hit #11964's Biggest Canadian Hits  Canadian Music Blog on the RPM top singles chart on December 7, 1964. The song's sung lyrics are limited to the title word alone, performed by an unidentified male chorus. The rest of the vocal performance consists of a spoken-word, first-person account of a Western lawman and his relationship with a notorious gunfighter, Ringo. The account in the song does not fit the known historical facts of the life of Western outlaw Johnny Ringo, but Greene was under the impression that the song was indeed about \\"Johnny Ringo the outlaw.\\"Mary Campbell. \\"Hit Parade is Topped by Stone Age Presley.\\" Brunswick (GA) News, December 16, 1964, p. 10. The \\"B\\" side of the disc contained a vocal version of the theme song of Greene's TV show Bonanza, with lyrics that were never used on the show. Greene recorded a French-language versionFrench, like English, is an official language of Canada. of \\"Ringo\\" with \\"Du Sable\\" (\\"Sand\\") on the flip side of the 45, released on the RCA Victor Canada International label #57-5623. A German- language cover by Ferdy changes the meaning somewhat and alters the ending, but is otherwise fairly close to the English version. Like Greene's French- language edition, the single is also backed with a German version of Sand. Like \\"Bonanza\\", \\"Ringo\\" began as a track on Greene's Welcome to the Ponderosa RCA Victor LP in late 1963. On the album each track was supplemented with an introduction to each song, separately tracked. Greene said the song was written as a typical western ballad, in the vein of \\"El Paso\\" by Marty Robbins. Given his fame on \\"Bonanza\\", he had asked the two songwriters to come up with a song that fit in with his persona on that show. He also acknowledged that some teens who bought the record were probably expecting it to be about Beatles-drummer Ringo Starr (even though it was never about him) and believed that after listening to it, they would not be disappointed that the song was actually about a western outlaw. Greene also noted that recording of the album featuring \\"Ringo\\" began before the Beatles became popular in the United States. Earl Wilson. \\"He Was So Honored He Forgot to Insult Big Ben.\\" (Columbia SC) The State, December 9, 1964, p. 16. The album's introductions to each track were left off of the single release. \\"Ringo\\" debuted in Billboard in October 1964. At the same time a special promotional recording by Greene (possibly Canadian only) was sent to radio stations to promote the album, where he speaks about seven of the album's tracks. \\"Ringo\\" was the lead track. On it, Greene talks about the probable confusion between his song character and The Beatles and the \\"wonderful drummer of theirs\\", assuring the listener that it is not about him. About this time the album had been upgraded to include a notation on the front jacket, FEATURING THE BIG HIT \\"RINGO\\". A completely sung version of the song was recorded by Riders in the Sky.It is featured on their 2003 album Silver Jubilee. Their version is a remake of the version done years earlier by the Sons of the Pioneers in which member Tommy Doss sang the lead. In December 1964 the first parody of the song was issued: \\"Gringo\\", written by Marty Cooper and H.B. Barnum. Cooper himself would record it under the name \\"El Clod\\", a name he had used in 1962 to record a parody on the Challenge label for the song \\"Wolverton Mountain\\", which was called \\"Tiajuana Border\\". This \\"Ringo\\" parody would be issued on Vee Jay Records. Other parodies soon followed, including two by Frank Gallop with his 1966 hit single \\"The Ballad of Irving\\" on the Kapp label, which was quickly chased with a sequel, \\"The Son Of Irving\\" on the Musicor label (also in 1966). Another was released in the 1980s by Dutch comedian Andre van Duin (as \\"Bingo\\"); and then by Country Yossi and the Shteeble Hoppers (as \\"Shlomo\\"). Allan Sherman sang a parody on his special Allan Sherman's Funnyland on January 19, 1965, on which Lorne Greene also sang the original \\"Ringo.\\" The 2005 short film Ringo, which used the song along with public-domain footage of John Wayne and Roy Rogers, won the Short Film Award for animated film at the 2005 Seattle International Film Festival.Awards for Ringo - Internet Movie Database Personnel *Lorne Greene - vocals *Hal Blaine - drums, percussionBlaine, Hal and David Goggin, Hal Blaine and the Wrecking Crew: The Story of the World‚Äôs Most Recorded Musician, MixBooks, Emeryville, California, 1990 * Tommy Tedesco, guitar Tedesco,Tommy, Tommy Tedesco: Confessions of a Guitar Player: An Autobiography.

It is the oldest Roman Catholic church in Bristol; the first one built after the Reformation. it was formerly administered by the Society of Jesus and is currently served by the Divine Word Missionaries. It is a Grade II* listed building. History=Foundation From the 1740s, Catholics in Bristol could pray in a private chapel, on St James Back (which was later renamed as Silver Street). The chapel's own records date from 1777. With the Catholic population of the city increasing, a new, larger place of worship had to be sought. In 1786, the Earl of Arundel paid for a new site on Trenchard Street for a chapel, which became St Joseph Chapel. Construction work on the new chapel began in March 1788. On 27 June 1790, it was opened and congregation moved to the new chapel. The St James Back chapel was sold off that year.St Joseph's Catholic Chapel, Trenchard Street, and St Mary's on the Quay Catholic Church from The National Archives, retrieved 16 December 2014Trenchard Street Chapel (St Joseph's RC), Bristol from Gloucestershire Places of Worship, retrieved 16 December 2014 Construction The St Mary on the Quay church building was originally intended to be a chapel for the Catholic Apostolic Church (also called 'Irvingites') in Bristol.

In 1843, the Catholics bought it and renamed it St Mary on the Quay Church. Establishment The first priest was a Franciscan, Fr Patrick O'Farrell. He served the parish until 1857. That year, the parish was handed over to the Society of Jesus. The St Joseph Chapel continued as a place of worship until 19 November 1871. It was turned into a school and parish hall for St Mary on the Quay Church. When the church was built, the Bristol Floating Harbour came to the front the church. There were boating rings in the front wall so that boats could be tied to the church, while they were docked at the harbour. In 1893, the harbour was covered over and now a road, Colston Avenue, is in front of the church. The boating rings were later removed. In 1978, the parish hall, the old St Joseph Chapel, was sold to become housing. In May 1981, it was demolished with only the fa√ßade remaining.St Joseph from ChurchCrawler.co.uk, retrieved 16 December 2014 The Jesuits administered the parish until 1996, when the church was placed under the care of the Diocese of Clifton. In 2004, the Bishop of Clifton, Declan Lang, invited the Divine Word Missionaries to serve the parish which they continue to do. Archives Archives for St Mary on the Quay church, Bristol (and the preceding chapel, St Joseph's Chapel, Bristol) are held at Bristol Archives (Ref. 37553) (online catalogue) including baptism, confirmation, marriage and death registers.

Many would consider him one of the most influential and important archaeologists of Medieval Italy. Francovich was a pioneer in the world of Italian archaeology.

In this last task he experienced contrasting results. The park he made at Montarrenti never took off. On the other hand, the one at Rocca San Silvestro, known as the Parco Archeominerario di San Silvestro was a huge success. These experiences became the cornerstone of Francovich's career, turning his attention toward landscape architecture. He became a great supporter of local participation in site management. The Parco Archeominerario di San Silvestro. Francovich's career as an archaeologist, with specialization in Medieval Archaeology in Italy, spanned nearly three decades.

These events include the rediscovery of the icon unharmed over 100 years after it is supposed to have been thrown into a pond. There are no extant accounts as to how this icon first appeared at the monastery of the Theotokos at Miasena, near the city of Melitene, Little Armenia. The monastery was founded by St. Acacius of Melitene in the 5th century. It is known that the icon is linked to several miracles which have been linked to its presence there. Accounts to how it disappeared differ. Some sources say that the icon was cast into the water (either the pond of Ghazour near the monastery or Lake Zagura) because the local population feared that the icon would be destroyed by the iconoclast Leo III the Isaurian. Other accounts indicate that it was cast in the water by the iconoclasts specifically to be destroyed. Roughly one hundred years later, Michael III restored the veneration of icons. Toward the end of his reign, on September 1, 864, the icon is said to have been rediscovered after having risen to the surface of the lake it had earlier been cast into, completely unharmed. The icon was restored to the monastery of Miasena. This incident is commemorated in the calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church as the Synaxis of the Most Holy Theotokos in Miasena Monastery on September 1. On this feast, people pray for Mary's special protection and guidance.

Early life Bahr, who served in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War and then worked for several years on the railroads, enrolled at the University of Mississippi in the early 1970s when he was in his late 20s. He received his B.A. and M.A. from Ole Miss and served as the curator of the William Faulkner house, Rowan Oak, in Oxford, Mississippi, for nearly twenty years. Literary career He also taught American literature during much of this time at the University of Mississippi. In 1993, he became an instructor of English at Motlow State College in Tullahoma, Tennessee, where he worked until 2006. Bahr is the author of three critically acclaimed novels centering on the American Civil War. He currently resides in Jackson, Mississippi, and teaches courses in creative writing at Belhaven University. Bahr began his writing career in the 1970s, writing both fiction and non-fiction articles that appeared in publications such as Southern Living, Civil War Times Illustrated, as well as the short-lived regional publication, Lagniappe (1974‚Äì75) which he and Franklin Walker co-edited. His first published book, a children's story entitled \\"Home for Christmas,\\" came out in 1987 and was re- published in 1997 in a different edition (with new illustrations) following the release of his first novel, The Black Flower: A Novel of the Civil War. This latter book, set during the Battle of Franklin in 1864, was a New York Times Notable Book. In 2000, Bahr's second novel, The Year of Jubilo, was released. This novel, set in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War in the fictional Mississippi town of Cumberland, deals with the dehumanizing effects of war and its aftermath on Southern society. The Year of Jubilo, like The Black Flower, was a New York Times Notable Book. Bahr's third novel, The Judas Field, was released in 2006. In The Judas Field, Bahr again returns to the Battle of Franklin theme, but this time it is through the eyes of one of its participants, again from Cumberland, who travels back to the battlefield in the 1880s to recover the body of one of the fallen, and, in doing so, relives the horror of that fateful day in 1864. Bahr's fourth novel, Pelican Road, published in 2008, is a novel of the railroads. It is named for its Christmas 1940 setting on \\"207 miles of ballasted heavyweight main line rail between Meridian, Mississippi, and New Orleans.\\" Awards His novel The Black Flower: A Novel of the Civil War received the W.Y. Boyd Literary Award for Excellence in Military Fiction in 1998.http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/awards/2/all_years Boyd Award Recipients List His third novel, The Judas Field was awarded the Michael Shaara Award for Excellence in Civil War Fiction.

It starred Buddy Hackett, and featured Richard Kiley and Karen Morrow. Plot overview Set on the Coney Island Boardwalk, it focuses on matchmaking grifter turned fortune teller Garside, who tries to set up his friend, fellow grifter and recent parolee Stan, with Wonder Wheel owner/operator Jeannie. Garside finds his crystal ball is real, as it foretells Stan falling in love with former Coney Island hawker (trade) and man-eater Addie (who's returned to the alley while on the prowl for rich husband number four), and Jeannie falling in love with Brooks, a loan shark to whom Garside owes a hundred bucks (even though he only borrowed four). Garside watches the mismatched couples meet while getting dragged off to prison by Officer Millhauser (for running a fortune telling scam) ending the first act. Other characters include Ma Maloney, who heads the Alley Gang: Joe the Muzzler, Osaka Moto, and Gimlet. Act II finds the successful couples returning the day Garside comes back from jail, only for the ball, which Ma has kept safe, to make another prediction. Jeannie celebrates her newfound happiness at a party, singing the title song, only to have it all dashed again when Brooks, who misinterpreted the ball's prediction as referring to a business deal, tells her they're broke; he's even sold the Wonder Wheel on her. Meanwhile, Stan catches Addie cheating on him and leaves her. As Addie is telling Garside about her failed marriage, Brooks shows up to get revenge for the bad business advice, and the two meet and fall in lust. As the newly poor Stan and Jeannie try to make a living on the boardwalk, they wind up chased by Officer Millhauser until he finally handcuffs them together, much to the delight of Garside, as the right couple has finally found each other, once he points out to them who's on \\"the other half\\" of their cuffs. Background I Had a Ball was similar to earlier projects designed to showcase the talents of a comic, short on plot and overloaded with vaudeville-like comedy routines and musical numbers. In this case the star was nightclub and television comic Buddy Hackett, appearing for the first time in a structured theatrical production. Steven Suskin called this the \\"clown show\\"; \\"They were about the fellow ‚Äî almost always a man ‚Äî at the center. Ed Wynn or Bert Lahr or Victor Moore or the brothers Marx...\\"\\"ON THE RECORD: 'I Had a Ball' and Jessica Molaskey's 'Good Day'\\" playbill.com, June 1, 2003 Production The production had a critically and commercially successful run in Detroit. After an additional stop in Philadelphia, the musical opened on Broadway at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 15, 1964 where it ran for 199 performances.\\"Jack Lawrence, Biography\\" songwritershalloffame.org, accessed May 24, 2012\\"'I Had a Ball'\\" playbillvault.com, accessed May 24, 2012 Choreography was by Onna White. Lloyd Richards, who later was the Artistic Director for the Yale Repertory Theatre and a frequent collaborator with playwright August Wilson, was signed to direct. Following a clash with producer Joseph Kipness he was replaced by John Allen, although Richards retained official credit in the program. Prior to opening, several songs had to be cut; Hackett's lack of singing ability led to Garside's solo \\"Lament/I'm An Average Guy\\" being removed, as well as Hackett's duet with Kiley entitled \\"Be A Phony.\\" \\"I'm An All American Boy\\", a song that Kiley enjoyed and had requested for himself (but which had been written for a different character), was poorly received in Detroit and was removed. In addition to Hackett as Garside, the cast included Richard Kiley as Stan, Karen Morrow as Jeannie, Steve Roland as Brooks, Luba Lisa as Addie, Rosetta LeNoire as Ma Maloney, and Ted Thurston as Officer Millhauser. The Alley Gang was made up of Al Nesor as Gimlet, Jack Wakefield as Joe the Muzzler, and Conrad Yama as George Osaka. Morocco, a belly dancer was credited as herself.Mercury Records OCM 2210 - Liner/inner booklet notes. Reception The New York City critics were less enamored with the show than their Detroit counterparts had been, and without a strong directorial hand to keep him under control, Hackett soon began ignoring the script and breaking character to inject his own routines into the proceedings, especially to defend the show from reviews. Despite mixed reviews, positive word-of-mouth, linked with one night cameos made by several of Hackett's friends during a tunnel of love sequence such as Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, and Steve Lawrence caused an increase in the box office. However, competition from heavy-hitters like Fiddler on the Roof, Hello, Dolly! and Funny Girl, plus Hackett demanding to be released from his contract without a replacement ready ultimately led to an early closing. Luba Lisa was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical and received the 1965 Theatre World Award for her performance. Recordings The original Broadway Cast Recording was released on the Mercury label in 1965. A reviewer of the recording wrote: \\"There are a couple of mildly witty numbers, 'Neighborhood,' sung by Rosetta Le Noire, and 'The Affluent Society,' by Kiley and Steve Roland, and the romantic ballad 'Almost' isn't bad. But little of the music is memorable, and some of it is derivative.\\"Ruhlmann, William. \\"'I Had a Ball'\\" allmusic.com, accessed May 24, 2012 A compilation, I/We Had a Ball, consisting of jazz versions of songs from the musical was released on Limelight Records in 1964.

In addition to these 29 days as president, he also held a number of other governmental roles as well as being a prominent figure in the Bolivian military. A native of Potos√≠, √Ågreda had fought in the battles of Junin and Ayacucho under Antonio Jos√© de Sucre, for which the Grand Marshal rewarded him as commander of the Military College in Chuquisaca. Later still, he was appointed commander of the Army by Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, and was considered a national hero for heading the Bolivian forces that routed Argentina at the Battle of Montenegro (1838). A loyal supporter of the Grand Marshal, in June 1841 General √Ågreda succeeded in removing Gen. Jos√© Miguel de Velasco from power, installing himself as de facto ruler pending the return of Santa Cruz. He only controlled portions of the Army and, moreover, faced the opposition of the venerated members of Congress, with whom he had clashed since they insisted on naming one of their now to the post of Provisional President. After only a month in power, he agreed to leave provided Congress name a pro- Santa Cruz Provisional President until Santa Cruz himself could return to rule. This done, he left the Government Palace, and remained a respected war hero. Indeed, he became an elder statesman of sorts, serving as ambassador abroad and member of the Cabinet under Jos√© Ballivi√°n, and Prefect of La Paz and Chuquisaca in his latter years (chiefly in the administrations of Jorge C√≥rdova and Jos√© Mar√≠a Ach√°).

Rand Sr. (1864-1919), former president and chairman of the board of directors of Marine Midland Bank, who was killed in a plane crash near Caterham in Surrey, England. The Buffalo Broadcasting Company moved its stations WGR and WKBW to the building; the stations had moved out of the building by 1959. The \\"GR\\" in WGR stands for George Rand; the station was founded by the Federal Telephone and Telegraph company in 1922, in which Rand was a major investor. Today, the stations in the Townsquare Media cluster (WMSX, WBLK, WBUF, and WYRK) broadcast from studios in the Rand Building and have their transmitting antennas located atop its beacon. Adjacent to the Rand Building is 10 Lafayette Square in Lafayette Square. George F. Rand Jr. had a private dining room on the top floor of the building that he used for business lunches. When the building opened, it featured an elaborate lighting system that highlighted its art deco stepped back style. In December 2014, the building was sold by real estate developer David L. Sweet to Paul J. Kolkmeyer, a developer and former CEO of First Niagara Bank, for $3.89 million. Kolkmeyer's firm, Amherst-based Priam Enterprises LLC, buys, manages and develops residential apartment buildings and student housing in Buffalo and the surrounding communities. In addition to purchasing the Rand Building, Kolkmeyer purchased the Main Court Building at 43 Main St. (for $4.5 million), as well as the Main Seneca Building, designed by Green & Wicks, at 237 Main St., the Roblin Building at 241 Main St., (together for $2.56 million) and The Stanton Building (also known as the Glenny Building), designed by Richard A.

The imam orders a bottle be discarded into the sea, Darma (Pierre Andre) is traumatised by the mysterious death of his fiancee, Rose (Intan Ladyana) who had killed herself. Unknown to him, Rose had been haunted by a malicious spirit which they had brought to her home after picking up a small jar found washed up at the beach. Apparently, the spirit had been imprisoned and was inadvertently released by the couple. At her home, after her death, before leaving Darma had taken the small jar with him, and with it, the malignant spirit. Not satisfied with why Rose had suddenly killed herself, Darma decides to investigate the case with the help of Rose's twin sister, Seri, (also played by Intan Ladyana). As they probe into the death, a series of strange occurrences start to unravel, leaving Darma in a disturbed state of mind that affects his life and career. When he is advised to take a week's break from work, he returns to his village to rest. Unknown to him, he is only getting closer to solving his fiancee's death and the truth behind the strange happenings. It was Darma's senile grandmother who could see the ghost and had unwittingly invited the spirit into the house. In Malay belief, certain spirits cannot enter the house unless invited in.

The film had its world premiere at the 2005 Pusan International Film Festival.Official Selection Detail, 2005 Pusan International Film Festival, retrieved 2007-04-02. Summary Shot on digital video, the documentary tells the story of Prayoon Kamchai, principal of the Baan Mae Toh school in rural, mountainous Chiang Mai Province. Faced with poor families of hill tribe (mostly Karen and Hmong) subsistence farmers and rugged terrain, Prayoon sought to find a way to ensure children in his far-flung school district received a proper education. Children would often have to travel 80 to 90 kilometers on narrow, winding mountain roads, which in the rainy season became impassable, to get to school. Often, children's parents were too poor to afford tuition. Prayoon, who asked to be assigned to the school when he started teaching in 1983, at first noticed the children had no food, so he decided to start a free lunch program. He then solved the problem of transportation by creating a boarding school and finding a way for as many children to attend as the school could accept. The school receives a small amount of funds from the Thai government. Building supplies for the boarding school dorms were donated, and much of the building work and other improvements at the school were made by the students and teachers themselves. To supplement the small meal allowance from the government, the students raise their own vegetable crops and livestock. Baan Mae Toh school offers classes up to Mattayom 3, or ninth grade. As a reward for graduating from the school, Prayoon arranges for the class to take a trip to the beach in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, a trip of more than 1,000 kilometers that takes three days, by truck and bus. For all the children, it is the first time they will see the ocean. Along the way, the children stay at Buddhist temples for free to keep the cost of the journey low. Production Producer-director Areeya Chumsai is a Thai-American model who was Miss Thailand Universe 1994. She then moved to Thailand permanently, became an officer in the Royal Thai Army and taught English at the army's military academy, as well as writing magazine columns and books. Co-director, principal cinematographer and editor Nisa Kongsri had worked as an assistant director, working on such films as Siam Renaissance and One Night Husband. Phanjanit Garnploog produced and edited an international version of the film. Areeya, wanting to research her idea for a film about hill tribe children, contacted Nisa for help. The two formed a partnership and developed a screenplay for Innocence, which was selected for presentation at the 2003 Pusan International Film Festival. Reception=Impact When Innocence was released, the Thai government had made cuts to its education budget, reducing student meal allowances from 20 baht a day to 12 baht. Coverage of the film in the Thai media brought attention to the issue and the government rescinded the cuts.Kuipers, Richard. 2006-02-24. Innocence Dek toh (Documentary -- Thailand), Variety, retrieved 2007-04-02. Proceeds from the film and a fund-raising campaign have also gone to support the school. Critical reception Kong Rithdee of the Bangkok Post mentioned Innocence in his recap of Thai films released in 2005, saying the documentary supplied \\"meaty stuff to the multiplexes usually swamped with feature films ... [it helped] pry open the door for the release of alternative cinema and refreshed the audience's perception that documentaries do deserve a space on the big screen.\\".Rithdee, Kong, 2006-01-06, Real Time section, Page R1, Bangkok Post (print edition; online version is archived for subscribers only). Festivals and awards The film had its world premiere at the Pusan International Film Festival, where it was screened in the \\"Wide Angle\\" program. It then had a limited run in Bangkok cinemas, and was also screened at the 2006 Bangkok International Film Festival. At the CineMekong Film Festival, organized by the Alliance fran√ßaise in Phnom Penh, it was awarded the Prix de la Diversite Culturelle. The film was then screened at the EBS International Documentary Festival in Seoul, where it won the Spirit Award. In November 2006, the filmmakers did a tour of film festivals in Europe, screening Innocence at the Lyon Asian Film Festival, the International Film Festival for Children and Youth in Madrid and the Festival des 3 Continents in Nantes.

The tower is connected to the Main Place Mall, downtown's only shopping mall, with a gross leasable area of .About Main Place Mall In recent years, it has lost a great deal of its retail shops to suburban shopping centers. The tower, built in 1969, rises 350 feet (107 meters). History The current location of the Main Place Tower was originally Shelton Square, a city block of considerable traffic in the city. Shelton Square was the site of a notorious publicity stunt in 1955, when disc jockey Tom Clay climbed to the top of a billboard in the square and disrupted traffic by repeatedly playing \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" by Bill Haley & His Comets on a loudspeaker; the incident led to Clay's firing and arrest. and Originally the headquarters for the Erie County Savings Bank, it became known as One Empire Tower when the Erie County Savings Bank became Empire of America, the building was then renamed \\"Main Place Tower\\" in the 1980s with the demise of Empire of America. The Main place tower was constructed as part of an urban renewal project. The land site of the building was previously home to the Richardsonian Romanesque castle-like Erie County Savings Bank Building (1890-1968). The Erie County Savings Bank was both the anchor tenant and financial backer for the Main Place tower construction and leased the first three floors upon its completion. As of 2020, the mall had only four tenants remaining, and no major national chains; two restaurants and a food court also operate. That year, the city announced plans to collaborate with Main Place's owner and close the mall to make room for more office and parking space, which is intended to alleviate the high occupancy rate of the tower.

As of April 2013, the Register had 8.5 million numbers listed. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Register and enforces compliance with the DNCR Act and related industry standards. In September 2014, Salmat was awarded the contract to operate the Register, commencing in mid-2015. Members of the public can make complaints about telemarketing calls and marketing faxes to ACMA, which may also conduct formal investigations and take enforcement action.enforcement action The Do Not Call Register scheme gives Australians the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving most telemarketing calls and marketing faxes. It is against the law for telemarketers to make unsolicited calls or to send marketing faxes to a number on the register without consent. The best way a telemarketer or fax marketer can ensure they comply with the DNCR Act is to check their list against the register at least every 30 days, prior to making marketing calls or faxes.

He played college football for Texas Tech University, earned All-American honors and won the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top college running back. A second-round pick in the 1997 NFL Draft, he played professionally for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Early years Hanspard was born in Dallas, Texas. He attended DeSoto High School in DeSoto, Texas, and played high school football for the DeSoto Eagles. College career Hanspard attended Texas Tech University, where he played for the Texas Tech Red Raiders football team from 1994 to 1996. As freshman in 1994, he recorded 761 yards rushing on 173 carries. In the following season, he had 1,374 yards on 248 carries. In 1996, he accumulated 2,084 yards rushing (and a total of 2,276 all-purpose yards). He was one of two running backs to rush for 2,000 yards that year, the other being Troy Davis. However, Hanspard edged out Davis for the Walker Award in part because he played on a winning team. He was recognized as a unanimous first-team All-American, and finished sixth in the voting for the 1996 Heisman Trophy. He was only the third Red Raider to be named a unanimous All-American, after Mark Bounds in 1991 and Zach Thomas in 1995. He has since been joined by Michael Crabtree in 2007-08 and Jace Amaro in 2013. Hanspard is Texas Tech's all-time leader in career rushing yards (4,219 yards in three seasons) and rushing yards per game. He ranks second in career rushing attempts. He also holds school records for single-season rushing attempts (339 in 1996) and most yards in a single game (287 against Baylor in 1996‚Äîone of seven career 200-yard games). He also ranks second in career rushing attempts and is in a four-way tie for seventh in single-season and career touchdowns.Texas Tech 2006 Football Media Guide Hanspard announced shortly after the end of the 1996 season that he would give up his last year of eligibility and enter the 1997 NFL Draft. An ordained Pentecostal minister, he said that he felt the NFL gave him a better opportunity to expand his ministry.\\"Hanspard to Turn Pro\\", The New York Times, December 31, 1996.

However, he later became the source of controversy after it emerged that he had all but abandoned his studies during what turned out to be his last year in school, posting a 0.00 grade point average for the 1996 fall semester. In part because of this, Texas Tech withdrew from bowl consideration in 1997. Hanspard did not return his Doak Walker Award, however. More than two decades after leaving Texas Tech, Hanspard graduated from Texas A&M-Commerce; in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in organizational leadership.

He also set a team record (since broken) for the longest run from scrimmage‚Äîa 77-yard burst against the Oakland Raiders. He suffered a severe knee injury during training camp in 1998 and missed the entire season. He returned in 1999 but was unable to return to his previous level of play. Despite increased playing time due to the loss of Jamal Anderson, he only gained 383 yards on 136 carries. The Falcons cut him during training camp in 2000 after he lost a fumble in a preseason game.

He also served as Vice-President to Andr√©s de Santa Cruz y Calahumana between 1835 and 1839. Biography Educated as a Chuquisaca lawyer, Calvo had been a royalist who was even head of the Cabildo (colonial assembly) in 1818. He later switched sides and, despite spending a number of years in the political wilderness, distinguished himself in the 1830s as a supporter, collaborator, and cabinet member of Andr√©s de Santa Cruz, rising to the post of Minister of Foreign Relations. He then became Vice-President of the Bolivian portion of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, again under Santa Cruz, who was both President of Bolivia and the Confederation's Supreme Protector in Lima. As such, most of the daily running of affairs in Bolivia fell to the trusted Calvo. With Sebasti√°n √Ågreda's resignation in 1841, Congress was reassembled. The latter desperately wanted to return to established Constitutional norms, and thus agreed to temporarily turn the reins of state to Calvo, as the last Vice-President of Bolivia under Santa Cruz, pending the latter's return. Calvo is thus considered to be the first civilian President of Bolivia. He had difficulty, however, in running the country, with the military divided among pro-Velasco and pro-Santa Cruz camps. In fact, civil war loomed, with part of the country under different military controls, and with a pending Peruvian invasion known to be on its way at the worst of times. The latter finally materialized (no doubt spurred by the unmistakable appearance of chaos and weakness at the helm in La Paz) in late August 1841. Trusting the fate of the whole country to its military, Calvo could only hope for a miracle. The latter indeed occurred, when General Jos√© Ballivi√°n, head of the Bolivian Army, inflicted an astonishing defeat on the invading forces of Peru at the Battle of Ingavi, where the Peruvian President himself, the notorious Agustin Gamarra, was made prisoner and later executed by Ballivi√°n. With the latter the indisputable hero of the moment, Calvo could only acquiesce when Congress named the General Provisional President, once again pending a possible return of Marshall Santa Cruz. Calvo would die only a year later in Cochabamba. He was the first native of the Bolivian capital, La Plata/Chuquisaca (later renamed Sucre) to occupy the Bolivian presidency, and also has the distinction of having been President at the time of the rout of Peruvian forces at Ingavi.

Theoretical Girls played only about 20 shows (three of which took place in Paris). It released one single (\\"U.S. Millie\\"/\\"You Got Me\\"), which had some attention in England where it sold a few thousand copies. The band was never signed by a record company, but is well regarded as an early leading no wave group that mixed classical modern ideas of composition with punk rock. This experimental music was mostly supported by the New York art world and minimal art music audience. History Theoretical Girls was formed after Branca and Lohn's previous group the Static and performed its first show at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation. Artist Jeff Wall came up with the band's name during a discussion of women making conceptual art.Moore and Coley, p. 56 The Theoretical Girls were among the most enigmatic of the late 1970s no wave bands of the New York underground rock scene,Masters, pp. 110 -117 famous not so much for their music, since they released only one single during their brief existence, but because the group launched the careers of two of New York's best known experimental music figures, composer Glenn Branca and producer Wharton Tiers. The latter played drums, the former guitar in the quartet, which also featured keyboardist Margaret De Wys and vocalist/guitarist Jeffrey Lohn, a classically trained composer who, like Branca and so many others in the no wave scene, wasn't interested in working with popular musical forms until inspired to do so by the explosion of punk rock. The group's sound shared aesthetics with the other no wave bands working in Manhattan at the time, such as The Contortions and DNA. Always confrontational and often funny in an aggressive way, the band's sound consistently displayed the influence of American minimalist composers, ranging from sparse, clattering rhythm pieces that sound like immediate forebears of early 1980s Sonic Youth, to abrasive slabs of art-punk noise music.Masters, pp. 110 -117 Two recordings subsequent to the dissolution of the band have emerged in recent years, helping to preserve the band's legacy. The first, which came out on Atavistic in 1995, consists of all the Glenn Branca-penned songs, including \\"You Got Me\\", the flipside from the group's only single. The A-side, \\"U.S. Millie,\\" appears on a newer collection of Theoretical Girls songs all written by Lohn. That compendium owes its existence to Acute Records proprietor Daniel Selzer, who spent several years collaborating with Lohn to compile the songs, working from poorly recorded old rehearsal tapes and live reels. Currently Jeffrey Lohn resides in the East Village neighborhood of New York City and keeps to a private life. Glenn Branca continued to pursue a career as a musician, before succumbing to throat cancer on May 13, 2018 at the age of 69.

Augusta Mary Fremantle (a daughter of Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe). His paternal grandparents were Francis Richard Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss and Lady Anne Anson (a daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield). He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford.\\"Midleton, 2nd Earl of, (George St John Brodrick) (21 Feb. 1888‚Äì2 Nov. 1979).\\" WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO. 2007-12-01. Oxford University Press. Career From 1914 to 1918, he served in World War as aide-de-camp on the personal staff of Sir Ian Hamilton in Egypt and Gallipoli. In 1918, he was Staff Officer and was awarded Military Cross. During World War II, he served as aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. On 2 February 1920, his father was created Earl of Midleton and the Viscount Dunsford, of Dunsford in the County of Surrey. Thereafter, and until his father's death in 1942, he was referred to by the courtesy title of Viscount Dunsford. He succeeded his father, who had served as Secretary of State for War and Secretary of State for India, as the Earl of Midleton in 1942. In 1944, he sold the family seat, Peper Harow House (which had been built by Sir William Chambers for George Brodrick, 3rd Viscount Midleton in 1765), and the entire village, to property developers. Both are now owned by a trust. Personal life Lord Midleton was married three times to three actresses, but did not have any children from any of his marriages. His first marriage was to the actress Margaret \\"Peggy\\" Rush, a daughter of J. Rush, on 23 June 1917. They divorced in 1925 before he succeeded to the Earldom. Second marriage On 28 July 1925, when he was known as Viscount Dunsford, he married Guinevere Jeanne (n√©e Sinclair) Gould (1885‚Äì1978) at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal. Guinevere, an actress at the Gaiety Theatre, was the widow of George Jay Gould, and a daughter of Alexander Sinclair of Dublin. Her grandfather was Sir Edward Sinclair, provost of Trinity College, Dublin, and her cousin was Sir George McMunn, High Commissioner of Palestine. They were divorced in 1975. Third marriage In the 1950s he met film actress Irene Lilian Creese (1911‚Äì1993), better known by her stage name \\"Rene Ray\\" who was born in London and made her London acting debut at the Savoy Theatre in 1930. Lord Midleton and Rene, whose first husband was composer George Posford, moved to Jersey together in 1963. Immediately after his 1975 divorce from his second wife, Guinevere, he married for the third, and final, time to Rene on 24 April 1975. Lord Midleton died on 2 November 1979. Upon his death, the Earldom of Midleton and the Viscountcy of Dunsford became extinct, but the Viscountcy of Midleton passed to his second cousin, Trevor Lowther Brodrick. The Countess of Midleton died in 1993.

Built initially by the short-lived East Norfolk Railway, the station (along with the line) was incorporated into the Great Eastern Railway, who had operated the services from the beginning. It served as the terminus of Great Eastern Railway services from London and Norwich. Initially named Cromer on opening, it was renamed Cromer High on 27 September 1948. The station opened on 26 March 1877. Because of steep gradients near the town, the station was built in open fields some distance from the town itself. The station resembled in design Chingford railway station, opened in 1878, another GER branch line terminus. Closure On 23 July 1906 a connection was opened between the line to Cromer High and the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway line between Melton Constable and Cromer Beach stations, allowing through trains from Norwich to run to Cromer Beach. As Cromer Beach was far more conveniently sited in the centre of the town, passenger numbers using Cromer High dropped substantially, although it remained in heavy usage as a freight depot. On 20 September 1954 passenger services ceased at Cromer High, with all traffic diverted to Cromer Beach (renamed \\"Cromer\\" in 1969). The station remained open as a freight terminus until 7 March 1960, but was then closed completely and the station demolished. Despite the loss of passenger revenue, the bar attached to the station did not close until 1957. Part of the station site has been redeveloped for housing, but much remains undeveloped; although derelict and overgrown, the former station approach road is also still present. North Norfolk Council is considering converting the station into a site for the use of Travellers. Cromer High station was situated a short distance away from the Cromer Tunnel, Norfolk's only standard gauge railway tunnel, connecting the Sheringham and Mundesley lines. Although disused since services ceased in 1953, the tunnel remains intact.

Biography  K√§te van Tricht was born in Berlin, Germany. She was raised in Bremen, where her mother encouraged her not only to take piano lessons, but also to join the Bremen Cathedral Choir at age eight. Van Tricht held her first position as organist at age 19 at the Alte Waller Kirche in Bremen, and in 1930 obtained master's degrees in piano and organ performance at Bremen Conservatory (Staatliche Privatmusiklehrer-Pr√ºfung). Through the support of Richard Liesche, Director of Music at Bremen Cathedral, K√§te van Tricht was appointed Associate Organist at the Cathedral in 1933. From 1934 until 1937, she studied sacred music, piano performance (with Carl Adolph Martienssen) and organ performance (with Karl Straube), as well as counterpoint (with Johann Nepomuk David) at Leipzig Conservatory. During this time, she also frequently performed as a soprano soloist under the direction of Karl Straube. In addition to her activities as Cathedral Organist in Bremen over a period of 41 years, K√§te van Tricht launched a highly successful international career as an organ recitalist in the 1950s and made numerous recordings, both on LP and CD, at Bremen Cathedral and other venues. Following her retirement as Cathedral Organist in 1974, van Tricht was appointed as lecturer of music at Bremen University. In 1996, K√§te van Tricht was awarded the Federal Cross of Merit, First class (Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse). In July that year, she died at age 86 in Bremen. Among her former students is the German organist Martin Welzel. Discography * Das Orgelportrait: Das Silbermann-Positiv in der Krypta des Bremer Doms.

A draft was written by a commission elected by the Great National Assembly on March 27, 1952, and published on July 18. By a 324-0 vote, it was adopted by the Great National Assembly on September 24, when it came into force, and published three days later. The document contained an introductory chapter and ten further chapters containing 105 articles. Romania was proclaimed a \\"state of working people from the cities and villages\\" that \\"was born as a result of the historic victory of the Soviet Union against German fascism and the liberation of Romania by the glorious Red Army, a liberation that empowered the working people, above all the working class led by the Communist Party, to demolish the fascist dictatorship, to destroy the power of the exploiting classes and to build a state of popular democracy, which fully coincides with the interests and hopes of Romania's popular masses\\". The document provided for the state's independence and sovereignty to be \\"defended\\" by the \\"friendship and alliance with the great Soviet Union\\". The state's domestic politics were oriented toward \\"liquidating the exploitation of man by man and the construction of socialism\\" by strengthening and increasing the socialist sector of the economy and by realizing \\"in consequence a policy of limiting and eliminating capitalist elements\\". Among the Romanian state's functions were to repress \\"the classes removed from power\\" and to defend against external aggression. Through explicit provisions, the state was to have a dominant role not only in the economy, but also in areas such as education and culture. Regarding political institutions, there was no change from the preceding constitution, the Great National Assembly continuing as the supreme organ of state power, while local governing bodies were now known as \\"popular assemblies\\" ('). The Romanian Workers' Party was proclaimed \\"the leading force both of those who work, as well as of the state organs and institutions\\", at the same time gathering around itself \\"all organisations of those who work\\". Like its predecessor, the constitution enshrined citizens' fundamental rights and freedoms. In practice, these freedoms were not respected. For example, the constitutional guarantee of freedom of association was effectively neutered by a provision that banned associations of a \\"fascist or antidemocratic character,\\" which was broadly interpreted to ban nearly all associations that opposed Communist rule. Modified 11 times in the ensuing years, the 1952 Constitution was abrogated on August 21, 1965, when the 1965 Constitution of Romania came into force. References * Stoica, Stan (coordinator).

It was on the now disused Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway line between Roughton Road Junction and Overstrand station. It opened on 9 July 1923, only to close thirty years later on 7 April 1953.  History  Opened as part of an attempt to encourage holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost ¬£170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles. The halt was approached from the road by a path leading up the embankment on which the railway ran. To the west, a bridge carried the line over Northrepps Road from where it proceeded on another embankment before reaching Cromer Tunnel which was built by the Norfolk and Suffolk Joint Railway to take the line under the Great Eastern's Cromer High to Norwich route. Although only 61 yards long, the tunnel is notable as being one of only two standard gauge tunnels anywhere in Norfolk, the other being Barsham Tunnel on the Wells-on- Sea branch. However, as Barsham Tunnel was opened out before 1912, Cromer Tunnel is actually the only tunnel. The line was served in general by around half a dozen trains each way between North Walsham, Mundesley and Cromer Beach. However, with no direct service to Norwich - the nearest city - the halt was little-used, and closed in 1953 as part of a package of early rationalisation measures undertaken by British Railways after nationalisation, which also involved the closure of the line from Roughton Road Junction to Mundesley. The coastal line, although highly picturesque, carried little traffic and its closure made sound economic sense to British Railways.  Present day  Due to its wooden construction, virtually no trace of Cromer Links Halt has survived other than the gate to the approach path up the embankment, the rotting remains of which were said to be entangled in the undergrowth at the site of the station.

What country does this animal live in?, (2) According to the website, this particular octopus is an endangered species. For what reason?, (3) If Greenpeace were to ask you to save this octopus, would you support this and sign? YES, because ... NO, because ... (choose one), (4) Were there parts of the website you didn't understand? If so, please explain., (5) Are there any other comments about this website you would like to make?\\" Hence, these school children thought the text was about their willingness to undertake action for an endangered animal. The pupils who answered ‚ÄòYES‚Äô to question (3) were judged as perceiving the site as a reliable one. In this way, it was not necessary to explicitly ask about the reliability of the site, which would have risked priming them. The school children were debriefed after the session and they received a new media literacies training. Results The 2007 US study found that slightly more than half (27) of the 53 school children taking part in the study reported the website as being very reliable. Only 6 out of the 53 school children (11%) viewed the website as unreliable. Each of these 6 school children had just participated in a lesson that used this website to teach them to be suspicious of information online. In the 2017 Dutch study only 2 out of the total 27 school children (7%) recognized that the website was a hoax. The setting of the task (school environment), the trust in their teacher and the scholar, and the emotional involvement (the topic was an animal in danger) might have made it more difficult for them to perceive the information on the website as fake. Several told the scholar they were shocked that they had considered the digital information on the website to be reliable, as they had received several new literacies training at school over the past year.

He is the current manager of Milan Women. Club career A Sampdoria youth product, Ganz started his professional career with the Sampdoria senior side in 1985, making his professional debut in Serie A on 14 September 1986; he won a Coppa Italia with the club in 1988. He later moved to Monza in Serie B during the 1988‚Äì89 season, before helping Parma A.C. to Serie A promotion from Serie B during the 1989‚Äì90 season. He spent two more seasons in Serie B, and later played for Brescia, finishing the 1991‚Äì92 Serie B season as the top goal-scorer, with 19 goals, and helping the club win the league title, earning promotion to Serie A. In the summer of 1992 he transferred to Atalanta, making his Serie A debut with the club, and scoring 14 goals during his first season in the top division. He spent three seasons with the club, although Atalanta were relegated during his second season, and he passed his final season in Serie B. Ganz transferred to Internazionale in 1995, spending two seasons with the club; Ganz scored 36 goals from 68 appearances for the club, and was a feared goalscorer, earning the nickname \\"he always scores!\\" During his first season, he scored 13 goals in Serie A. The following season, he helped Inter to reach the final of the 1996‚Äì97 UEFA Cup, only to lose on penalties; he finished the tournament as the top goalscorer with 8 goals. That season, he also helped Inter to a third- place finish in Serie A, scoring 11 goals, and he helped his club reach the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, scoring a goal in the competition. In total he scored 10 goals in 16 appearances in European Competitions, and 3 goals in 14 appearances in the Coppa Italia, during his time at Inter. Ganz moved to local rivals A.C. Milan in 1997, helping the club to the 1998 Coppa Italia final during his first season with the club. In his second season, he won the Scudetto with Milan and was very influential, scoring several important goals, including one against his former team Inter in a memorable 5‚Äì0 win in a Milan Derby cup tie. His third season was less successful, as Milan were defeated by Parma in the 1999 Supercoppa Italiana final. Ganz did not find much space in the squad that season, and spent a lot of his time on the bench, as Alberto Zaccheroni, the Milan manager at that time, had several other star offensive players, such as Oliver Bierhoff, George Weah, Andriy Shevchenko, Leonardo, and Zvonimir Boban. During the second half of the 1999‚Äì2000 Serie A season, he went on loan to Venezia. He spent the first half of the 2000‚Äì01 season with Atalanta before eventually moving on to Fiorentina for the second half of the season, as a replacement for the injured Enrico Chiesa. He later played for two seasons with Ancona in Serie B, helping the club to gain Serie A promotion in 2003, for the first time in 11 years. He moved to Modena for the 2004‚Äì05 Serie B season, and later spent a single Lugano in the Swiss Challenge League, scoring 11 goals. He ended his career in 2007 with Pro Vercelli in Serie C2, scoring 10 goals. Ganz finished his career with an impressive record of 204 goals in 469 games. International career Ganz represented Italy at the Under-17 World Cup in 1985. He received two call-ups for the Italian national team in 1993, but did not gain an international cap. He played one game and scored a hat-trick for Padania, an unofficial national team that competes in the Viva World Cup.

Overview  The film follows the daily life of Vanda Duarte, a heroin addict, in the shanty outskirts of Lisbon. The film's focus is also on the community of the district and its townscape. No Quarto da Vanda follows the drama film Ossos (1997) in which Vanda Duarte plays as an actress. The film took a year to shoot after the (mostly) one-person crew settled in the location, Fontainhas district, where Vanda and the community including Cape Verdean immigrants lived depressed lives. In spite of its three-hour length, the director Pedro Costa made the film in a realist style by using fixed shots entirely. Melancholic life of the community was shot on DV in a low-key way. Costa said about his impression of the district: > When I entered the Fontainhas area, there were colors and smells that made > me remember the things and events of the past, and also ideas about people > to which I am attracted. These ideas nestled close to each other, living > together even as they led very solitary lives because of violent and painful > separation. A form of interesting and incompatible relationships existed in > this. The film also sees this shanty district slowly being demolished. The displaced inhabitants are featured in Costa's next film Juventude em Marcha (Colossal Youth, 2006). Acclaim Despite its highly fictional nature, its elusive classification and its documentary-like hybridization allowed it to win the FIPRESCI Prize at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival in 2001 \\"for presenting life in its near-original form\\".http://www.fipresci.org/awards/awards/awards_2001.htm#yamagata Pedro Costa collected the France Culture Award (Foreign Cineaste of the Year) for directing the film at 2002 Cannes Film Festival.

The corridor serves an area from the Saint Paul Union Depot to the Mall via parts of the METRO Green Line and the METRO Blue Line, and a route running parallel to West 7th Street, which runs southwest from Downtown Saint Paul. The corridor creates a triangle connecting opposite ends of the Blue Line and Green Line. In December of 2017, a modern streetcar system similar to systems in Portland, Kansas City, and Detroit was selected as the locally preferred alternative with an alignment along West Seventh Street and MN-5. Geography of corridor West Seventh Street is also known as Fort Road because the road began as a route to Fort Snelling. The original Fort Road ran further south of West Seventh along the river bluff. Modern day Cliff Street and Stewart Avenue follow around the route of Old Fort Road. The road was platted in 1849 but the route had been used before as the last stretch of an oxcart trail for a fur trading route connecting Canada to Saint Paul via Fort Snelling. West Seventh neighborhood The West Seventh neighborhood is one of the oldest in Saint Paul. The neighborhood follows along West Seventh Street and is bound on the north by I-35E or the River Bluffs and by the Mississippi River to the South. It formed in the late 1830s from discharged soldiers and other pioneers building houses along the Mississippi River. Later, a boat dock south of Fort Snelling known as the Upper Landing became an important landing spot for dropping off settlers and supplies. The neighborhood grew as waves of settlers and immigrant came to the area to farm or work for local industrial sites. A sizable amount of industry is located between the Mississippi River and south of West Seventh Street. Workers built their houses close to local industry and different ethnic enclaves developed with the different waves of immigrants. Streetcars run along West Seventh Street in 1918. Development tended to spread southwest from the Upper Landing, later known as Uppertown, southwest to Fort Snelling along Fort Road. By 1884 a horse drawn street car line traveled along a portion of West Seventh Street. The streetcar line later became electrified by 1891. The line extended to Tuscarora Street by 1890 and to river bluff by 1891. Four other lines also traveled partially along the corridor on their path to Downtown. The line stopped just short of Fort Snelling on the Saint Paul side of Fort Road Bridge. The lack of an extension to Fort Snelling became undesirable to soldiers who wanted an easy connection to the city and civilians who worked on the military reservation. After a new bridge was constructed in 1909 the line was extended to the other side of the river. A free streetcar shuttle was constructed in Fort Snelling that met with the West Seventh line and then traveled in a single track in Fort Snelling. The Fort Snelling shuttle stopped operating in 1952 and the streetcar line was converted to a bus line in 1952 along with the rest of the Twin Cities transit system. The Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport was constructed near Fort Snelling in 1921. When it became a major transit hub the corridor was extended to the airport. In the 1989 a county transit plan for Ramsey County was made. The corridor between the airport and Downtown Saint Paul was considered an important corridor. When the Mall of America was constructed the corridor was extended to the mall. The route was first named the Riverview Corridor in February 1997 after the Ramsey County board unanimously voted the corridor as a higher priority than the Central Corridor.Baker, Ann (February 5, 1997) \\"RAMSEY COUNTY BOARD CHANGES TRANSIT COURSE//HIGH-SPEED ROUTE IS SOUGHT FROM ST. PAUL TO AIRPORT, MEGAMALL\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press Difficulty constructing I-35E The federal government as part of the Interstate Highway System began to plan for a missing link of Interstate 35E. The type of connection and location of the connection were both met with controversy. The missing piece through the West Seventh neighborhood, from State Highway 5 (West 7th Street) northeast to I-94 in downtown Saint Paul, was held up by controversy. Construction began in 1964, and was planned for completion in the 1970s as a typical six-lane freeway, but the National Environmental Policy Act was passed on January 1, 1970. In late 1969, Residents in Protest 35E (R.I.P. 35E) formed to oppose the completion of I-35E. The group convinced the city to drop its support, and in August it filed a lawsuit which successfully halted construction pending an environmental impact statement (EIS).Patricia Cavanaugh,Politics and Freeways: Building the Twin Cities Interstate System (Publication No. CURA 06-01), University of Minnesota Center for Urban and Regional Affairs and Center for Transportation Studies, October 2006 The Saint Paul City Council decided in late 1974 to support I-35E but later changed its support a R.I.P. 35E proposed alternative. The plan included a four-lane boulevard upgrade of Pleasant Avenue (the street chosen for the I-35E alignment), with another route such as Shepard Road or the nearby Lafayette Freeway forming part of I-35E. The group opposed any direct connection to I-94 near the State Capitol, where I-35E and I-94 were to merge. The EIS was completed in early 1975, identifying the primary benefit of completing I-35E to be connecting downtown Saint Paul to the Interstate Highway System, and the EIS determined that the original Pleasant Avenue corridor was the best choice. A bill passed by the Minnesota Legislature on May 31, 1975, imposed a moratorium on building I-35E while allowing several possible state highway routes that could be added to the Interstate Highway System. Two routes offered a direct connection to I-94, while a third was a parkway with no direct connection. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed (I-35E) to use the parkway route. The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983. The EIS was ruled valid and construction went forward. I-35E was opened from Highway 5 north to I-94 on October 15, 1990, 26 years after construction began. Potential alignments There are several different variations of the corridor but all of them have the Mall of America as one terminus and the Airport and Downtown Saint Paul as destinations. There were four possible routes along this section of the corridor; West Seventh Street, Interstate 35E, Shepard Road and along Canadian Pacific Railway tracks.Karlson, Karl J. (June 4, 1998) \\"STUDY: LIGHT RAIL POOR OPTION FOR RIVERVIEW CORRIDOR //BUSES BETTER FOR LINKING DOWNTOWN ST. PAUL, AIRPORT\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press West Seventh Street would be the most direct route but the right of way would need to be expanded. Interstate 35E already had an available right of way but created a longer route and bypassed many stretches of the West Seventh Neighborhood. Shepard Road is a direct route to Downtown but is out of the way of many ride generating places. The Canadian Pacific Railway right of way follows roughly along West Seventh but would be difficult to acquire the right of way rights. St. Paul side, with Fort Snelling on the other side. Every route requires crossing the Mississippi River from Saint Paul to Fort Snelling. The current Fort Road Bridge was built in 1960 by the Minnesota Department of Transportation and was designed by Sverdrup & Parcel Engineering Company. It is the third bridge on the site, the first bridge, a deck girder bridge was built in 1880. The second bridge, a metal arch bridge was built by 1912. While almost all of the proposed routes would use the Fort Road Bridge, one suggested using a rail spur north and using the Ford Parkway Bridge upstream. Both routes would have had potential problems with the adaptation of the current bridge. When using the Fort Road Bridge, it was unknown if it could handle light rail or if a tunnel on the Fort Snelling side of the bridge could be widened. If the Ford Parkway bridge was used there were additional concern with the alignment of the route to the bridge. The second bridge at the Fort Road site and the Ford Parkway Bridge had held streetcar traffic. Historic transit projects Different possible alignments of the Riverview Corridor The corridor was first identified for transit improvements around 1989 as part of regional transit studies. The route was first named the Riverview Corridor in February 1997 after the Ramsey County board unanimously voted the corridor as a higher priority than the Central Corridor. A study in 1998 by the Ramsey County Rail Authority determined that light rail would not be cost effective and that a busway would be the more viable. During the 2000 Minnesota legislative session there was a $525 million budget surplus of new ongoing state revenue. In order to compromise, the surplus would be split and spent with one third of the money each going to the House, the Senate and the Governor. Governor Jesse Ventura decided to use his $175 million portion of the surplus to lower auto license fees. After finding out it would be cheaper than expected Ventura agreed to allocate $44 million to a busway project. While the Riverview Corridor was not specifically mentioned, it was generally understood to be for the Corridor.Salisbury, Bill (May 10, 2000) \\"Near the Finish Line/Education Wins Big in Bonding Bill\\" Saint Paul Pioneer PressDornfield, Steven (May 11, 2000) \\"Legislative Slight of Hand// With Some Deft Skirting of the Rules, Gov. Ventura and Legislators Find a Last-Minute Way to Initiate a Bus-Oriented East Metro Transit Plan That Will Connect St. Paul to the Airport and the Mall of America.\\" Saint Paul Pioneer PressPattison, Kermit (May 11, 2000) \\"ST. PAUL RIVERVIEW CORRIDOR EYED FOR BUSWAY //EXPRESS ROUTE WOULD RUN FROM DOWNTOWN TO MEGAMALL, AIRPORT\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press Plans for the corridor soon developed and the route was finalized. The line would run along West Seventh street through the East Side of Saint Paul to the Maplewood Mall by 2004 with service increasing to every 7.5 minutes. Unlike the then Bus Route the new service would travel along West Seventh the entire way to Downtown rather than taking I-35E. They included widening West Seventh, from I-35E to Smith Avenue, by 4 feet in order to create bus-only lanes.Coleman, Toni (March 1, 2002) \\"Busway Project Put on Hold//Budget Bill REclaims Most of State Funding\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press Traffic signals would have been timed so buses would have priority. The section along the Phalen Corridor would become a dedicated transitway. There would have been 23 stations with the option to have pre-boarding fare collection.Coleman, Toni (October 23, 2001) \\"EAST METRO BUSWAY PLAN SCALED BACK//CITIZEN REACTION LEADS OFFICIALS TO ALTER DESIGN OF TRANSIT SYSTEM\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press The bill for the busway was inserted into an unrelated bill in conference committee in the last weekend of the legislative session with no legislative hearings. The method was described as \\"in clear violation of legislative rules.\\" House Republicans opposed the project but acquiesced in order to end the legislative session.Whereatt, Robert (February 16, 2002) \\"House bill would cut out planned St. Paul busway - The move, part of budget-balancing efforts, would aim to reclaim $40 million of the $44 million Riverview Corridor project.\\"Saint Paul Pioneer Press Critics of the Riverview Corridor argued that it would duplicate service of the Metro Transit Bus Route 54. The Route travels along the Corridor from the Mall of America to Downtown Saint Paul.Coleman, Toni (January 16, 2002) \\"Riverview Busway to Replace Route 54 //Metro Transit will Start Service March 16\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press There were also concerns about the low ridership projections. Only 16,000 people a day for light rail and only 12,000 a day on a busway were projected to travel along the route.Coleman, Toni (August 23, 2000) \\"Options Detailed for East Metro Transit//Light Rail, Busway Among Riverview Corridor Choices\\" Saint Paul Pioneer Press The project was supported much more on Saint Paul's Eastside than along West Seventh Street.Coleman, Toni (November 7, 2001) \\"East Side Welcomes Coming of Busway//Reception is in Contrast with West Seventh's\\"Saint Paul Pioneer Press West Seventh residents and businesses were concerned about loss of parking and sidewalk space because of the need to expand the street by 4 feet. In March 2002, $40 of the $46.1 million devoted to the project was taken back by the Legislature in order to balance the State's budget. The project was cut largely due to opposition and lack of strong support. Work since 2002 In 2002 plans were announced to introduce improved interim bus service along a portion of Route 54. The plan changed Route 54 from traveling along Interstate 35E from West Seventh to Downtown Saint Paul, to entirely along West Seventh and operating every 15 minutes as opposed to every 30 minutes. The change added 3 minutes to the 20 Minute trip from the Airport to Downtown and the 30 minutes trip from the Mall of America to Downtown. When money from the project was cut in March 2002, this was the extent of the Route's improved service. Plans to change and improve service reappeared when Metro Transit redesigned their service in 2003.Coleman, Toni (January 6, 2003) \\"EXPRESS BUS MAY COME TO WEST SEVENTH AFTER ALL\\" Saint Paul Pioneer PressBlake, Laurie (January 12, 2003) \\"Bus service improvements ahead\\" Star Tribune Bus Route 69 from Maplewood Mall to along West Seventh via Downtown Saint Paul had its route west of Downtown, along West Seventh, eliminated. Route 54 is currently a limited stop route and one of 14 routes that operate as a High Frequency route with service every 15 minutes or better.High Frequency Service Network Metro Transit Route 54 was extended past downtown Saint Paul to Maplewood Mall in 2018 as part of a federal grant. The project's total cost of $7.2 million is expected to boost ridership from 4,200 weekday rides to 6,500 by 2021. Buses, shelters, and operating costs were included in the project's cost. Half of Route 54's trips were extended from Mall of America to Maplewood Mall which results in service every 20 minutes during rush hour and 30 minutes during other times. The Metropolitan Council, the metropolitan planning organization for the Twin Cities, set the goal of doubling transit ridership by 2030 in their 2030 Transportation Policy Plan. One of the methods identified to increase ridership was implementing arterial bus rapid transit. West Seventh Street and East Seventh Street were two of nine arterial streets that are recommended for bus rapid transit. The 2030 Transit Master Study for the region also identified arterial bus rapid transit features and encouraged further study of several corridors. Metro Transit began study of 11 corridors for their potential for bus rapid transit in 2011-2012 with the goal of opening the first BRT line in 2014. By 2012, Snelling Avenue and West Seventh Street were identified as the first two candidates for implementation. Limited stop bus operations on West Seventh Ave would have allowed BRT-style improvements to be more easily integrated. The corridor was initially identified as the second best candidate for upgrades with an opening in 2016 but work on the project was deferred so Ramsey County could study further transit options in the corridor. The title of METRO B Line was eventually given to the Lake Street-Marshall Avenue-Selby Avenue Corridor from Uptown, Minneapolis to downtown Saint Paul. Current project On January 23, 2013, the Saint Paul City Council voted in favor of requesting the Ramsey County Regional Rail Authority to conduct a new transit study of the Riverview Corridor. The Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority is leading the Pre-Project Development (PPD) Study to research, analyze and identify opportunities to improve transit within the Riverview Corridor. This study is scheduled for completion in late 2015 and will involve reviewing the viability of transit modes, transit location, engineering issues, community needs and preferences, and estimated costs. The PPD Study will include an extensive public involvement and outreach effort to assure community input helps to inform the Study‚Äôs vision and the results of the analysis.http://www.riverviewcorridor.com Policy makers will use the results of the Riverview PPD Study to select a locally preferred alternative for the corridor. The choice will then advance into a more detailed study.

The ships were built in Poland in the Stocznia P√≥≈Çnocna shipyards in Gda≈Ñsk. Designed for beach landings, they can carry a 450-ton cargo. The ships have both bow- and stern- doors for loading and unloading vehicles, and the of vehicle deck stretches the length of the hull. Up to 25 armored personnel carriers can be embarked. While designed for roll-on/roll-off operations, they can also be loaded using dockside cranes. For this purpose there is a long sliding hatch-cover above the bow section for access to the vehicle deck. There are no facilities for helicopters. In total, 28 ships of this type were commissioned from 1975 to 1991. The last three ships were of the improved variant Project 775M, also called Ropucha II. These have improved defensive armament and accommodation for an increased number of troops. Operational history Most of the ships became part of the Russian Navy after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. They were used for landing troops at the Georgian port of Poti during the 2008 South Ossetia war and for deliveries of cargo during the Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. One ship of the class was delivered to the South Yemen in 1979 and served the Yemeni Navy until 2002, after it was sold as a civilian cargo named Sam of Yemen. It was the only unit of this class in service outside the former Soviet Union. On 3 August 2012, international media reported that three vessels of the class, Aleksandr Otrakovskiy, Georgiy Pobedonosets and Kondopoga would visit the Russian naval base in Tartus, Syria. The ships were part of the Northern Fleet. Earlier reports, quoting a source at the Russian general staff, said the ships would spend a few days in Tartus and would take on fresh supplies of food and water. British media added that the ships each had up to 120 marines on board. The Russian defence ministry left open the possibility that the ships might dock there at some point for logistical reasons, saying they had every right to do so. The General Staff source, who was not named, had said that after calling in at Tartus they would head for the Bosphorus and the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. From 2013 on, ten Ropucha-class ships, gathered from all four Russian fleets, were used to transport military equipment from Novorosiysk to Tartus in Syria, during an intervention in Syrian civil war, along with Ropucha-class ships.Kubiak, Krzysztof (2017).

The Chairman and President of the company is William Lennon, the grandson of Fred A. Lennon, founder of Swagelok. Lokring designs patented, weld equivalent pipe and tube fittings such as couplings, flanges, elbows, adapters, and more. The unique technology of the patented Lokring fittings utilize Elastic Strain Preload (ESP), and possesses a metal to metal leak-free seal that compresses or swages the pipe/tube wall. The company is prominent in the Shipbuilding, Submarine (Marine), Oil & Gas (Upstream and Downstream), and Nuclear Generation Industries, but also caters to other markets such as Steel, Pharmaceutical, Medical Gas, Railroad, and many more. Company history The Lokring Joint was originally invented to replace the Apollo Joint in the Apollo I: Saturn Mission in 1968. In 1988, Robert Benson, Lucien Ruby, and Chris Dietemann formed Lokring Technology. By 1989, Lokring had completed its first full year of operations successfully. By 1994, Lokring was listed in the top 500 rising companies on Inc.com. Wabtec Corporation (formerly a George Westinghouse company) purchased Lokring Technology in 1998 and moved the plant to Burlington, Ontario. In 2002, Lokring Technology was purchased by William Lennon, a fluid system component entrepreneur and venture capitalist.  Technology  Lokring patented connectors do not use elastomeric or rubber seals, O-rings, or gaskets. The Lokring patented connectors create their seal by shaping the pipe wall first elastically and then plastically with the connector. The connectors, based on helium testing, have a volatile organic compound emission rate that is no greater than 2.4*10-12 kilograms per hour or 4.6*10-8 pounds per year. The technology works like this: during a piping installation, the axial movement of the Lokring driver over the fitting body swages the body onto the pipe surface, compressing the pipe wall first elastically and then plastically. When the pipe wall resists this swaging action, it generates high unit compressive loads at the contact points. These contact stresses are high enough to plastically yield the pipe surface under the multiple sealing lands, forming a 360-degree circumferential, permanent, metal-to-metal seal between the pipe and fitting body. Finally, the installation process causes the Lokring driver to grow slightly in diameter ‚Äî an \\"elastic strain\\" ‚Äî so that it exerts an elastic, radial preload on the metallic seals. This secures the fitting for the life of the connection. Lokring Introduces the LTCS-333 Corrosion Resistant Process Fitting Several years ago, Lokring saw the opportunity to better serve the marketplace by developing a product that achieves the same integrity as welding but removes many of the challenges and long-term costs of hot work. In January 2010, the company introduced a new LTCS-333 Process Fitting, based on its tested ESP technology. Using the same design, LTCS-333 Fittings incorporated a new material ‚Äî low temp 4130 carbon steel ‚Äî that provided a new scope of capabilities for users.  Notable Uses  ExxonMobil identified a new alternative to hot work welding during their MEV (Maintenance Efficiency Venture) initiative in 2007 when they came across a pipe-fitting technology created by Lokring. At the time, Lokring was already a supplier to ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil‚Äôs MEV decision to support the use of Lokring‚Äôs pipe-fitting technology ‚Äì which requires no heat, is quick to install, and can be used by properly trained technicians without any welding experience ‚Äì strengthened the relationship between the two companies. The resulting gains have been tremendous: productivity and overall cost savings of about two-thirds in many settings and much improved safety due to the departure from hot work. This expanded partnership has benefited both companies: a safer, less-expensive technology for ExxonMobil and its facilities worldwide, and enhanced comprehension of and greater accessibility to foreign markets for Lokring. Indeed, ExxonMobil‚Äôs support of Lokring‚Äôs pipe-fitting technology has helped to promote the expansion of Lokring into new countries. Japan is one prominent beneficiary of the MEV partnership, prior to which Lokring had no presence. MEV worked with Lokring in order to meet Japanese piping specifications to use the Lokring product in ExxonMobil‚Äôs local facilities.

The castle remained intact during the early phase of Alemannic immigration in the 5th to 6th century, but was derelict by the 9th century, when it was rebuilt as a residence for Louis the German, which in turn became dilapidated and used as a source of building stone by the 13th century. The Lindenhof remained a place of civil assembly into modern times. In 1798, the citizens of Z√ºrich swore the oath to the constitution of the Helvetic Republic on the Lindenhof. In 1851 the Masonic Lodge 'Modestia cum Libertate' (1771) bought the residence 'Zum Paradies\\" and built a masonic building on the southern end of the square.

It is one of few noticeable pre-Cenozoic calderas, and its formation is associated to a period of crustal thinning that followed the Acadian orogeny in the northern Appalachian Mountains. It sits relatively near to the coastline. Geology The large elliptical feature is dated back to the late Devonian Period, and is partially covered in the north by overlying Middle Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Period strata. The volcano is north- south trending in its elliptical shape, with minimum dimensions of as outlined by regional gravitational and magnetic studies. The northern half of the volcano has since been covered by depositional rock strata. The caldera is bounded to the east and west by fused Ordovician to Silurian turbiditic metasedimentary rocks of the local Digdeguash and Flume Ridge geological formations. Late Silurian to Devonian granitic rocks of the Saint George Batholith bound part of the southern margin of the caldera. Rocks within the summit itself date back to the Upper Devonian, and show multiple fill sequences late in its history. The magma produced by Pleasant is rich in silica, as indicated by a large amounts of ignimbrite, tuff, rhyolite, and other igneous rocks rich in the mineral. Silica-rich magma does have a high viscosity, and therefore does not flow easily like basalt. As a result, gases tend to become trapped at high pressure within the magma. When the magma approaches the surface of the Earth the rapid off-loading of overlying material causes the trapped gases to decompress rapidly triggering explosive destruction of the magma and spreading volcanic ash over wide areas. Intrusion-related gold veins have recently raised great interest among economic geologists. In southwestern New Brunswick, which is part of the Canadian Alleghenian orogeny, several gold deposits have been recorded in the past. The positive early results have created great interest for gold-finding efforts, and the Mount Meager massif has proven to be an ideal candidate. Granitic intrusions within the caldera complex include the McDougall Brook Microgranite and the somewhat younger Mount Pleasant Granite. Gold quartz breccias and veins cut the McDougall Brook Microgranite and its volcanic wall- rock, while molybdenum-bismuth-tungsten and later polymetallic mineralization are related to the multiphase Mount Pleasant Granite. The numerous felsic sections are associated with episodes of fractional crystallization in a high- level, zoned magma chamber. Fractionation was continually interrupted by eruption of material from the roof zone such that seven phases of caldera growth have been recognized. Mount Pleasant lies along the southwestern margin of the caldera complex. Two mineralized zones, termed the Fire Tower Zone and the North Zone, occur within volcanic plugs about apart. The volcanic necks are defined by magmatic-hydrothermal breccias. Eruptive history The eruptive history of the Mount Pleasant Caldera can be divided into three stages of activity: the exocaldera sequence, the intracaldera sequence, and the late caldera-fill sequence. These can further be subdivided into strata based on their depth below the surrounding rock. The Intercaldera Sequence comprises formations that crop out from overlying flows in triangularly shaped area, and includes thick volcanic ash (tuff), thick breccia layers, and intermediate to felsic igneous rocks that tend to intrude the above layers and are typically located along caldera margin faults. The Exocaldera Sequence contains ash flow tuffs, mafic lavas, alluvial redbeds, and porphyritic felsic lavas that are distributed across five different layers. The late Caldera-Fill Sequence contains rocks that are similar to those of the outflows of the other, older layers, and comprises two formations and two relatively minor intrusive lava flows. The volcanic flows are generally mafic. The stratigraphic subdivision is supported by geochemical and mineralogical analyses, which indicate that the basaltic rocks are mantle-derived and have, unusually, relatively intraplate (or hotspot) type chemical affinities. The multiple andesite flows were probably derived from basaltic magma by the crystallization of the magma material. The relatively rare, more felsic flow units, are thought to have originated from high-end crystallization inside the magma chamber. The various stages of fractionation are continually interrupted by eruptions, and have allowed scientists to recognize seven stages of caldera development. The genesis of the caldera is related to a period of lithospheric thinning that followed the Acadian Orogeny in the northern Appalachians. The relative position of the Exocaldera and Intracaldera sequences is based on several observations: * The upper part of the Rothea formation (Exocaldera) contains about 1% biotite. The only intracaldera rocks with this much biotite is volcanic strata within sedimentary breccia of and a tuff unit near the Scoullar Mountain formation (Intracaldera). * Andesitic strata occurs only in two flow units: the South Oromocto Andesite of the Exocaldera sequence, and the Scoullar Mountain formation of the Intracaldera sequence. * The exocaldera Carrow formation contains clasts from the intracaldera Seelys formation. * The exocaldera Bailey Rock Rhyolite intrudes and overlies the Carrow formation, but is intruded by the intracaldera McDougall Brook Granite formation. =Exocaldera sequence= The exocaldera sequence consists of, in ascending stratigraphic order, the Hoyt Station Basalt, Rothea Formation, South Oromocto Andesite, Carrow Formation and Bailey Rock Rhyolite. The first and last flow units have the least extent, evidence of erosional activity after their formation but before the next deposited layer. The first and oldest layer is the Hoyt Station basalt formation, which is composed of at least two flow units. There are two types of rock associated with the basalt, conglomerate ranging in particle size from small pebbles to cobbles, and lithic lapilli- tuff (well-worn, consolidated volcanic ash). It is only directly exposed at the surface in one area, as a tuff on an extended solidified multi-age lava flow that extends northeast from the northern section of the volcano, colored green in the diagram at right. The next oldest layer is the Rothea formation. It can be divided into three major lava flow layers. The lower member consists mainly of unwelded (unjoined), but heavily compacted, pumiceous lapilli-tuff and crystal tuff strata. The middle member consists of rock ranging from nearly aphyric tuff at the base to crystal tuff near the top. The top section of the middle unit contains pyroxene. The top member consists of a fine- grained, typically reddish lava flow and another lithic tuff unit. It can be found exposed in a limited region, encompassing the flank of the Hoyt Station basalt, colored light yellow in the diagram at right; it also peeks out closer to the volcano twice. The next layer, the South Oromocto Andesite formation, is composed of at least three flow units, with basalt flows being the most extensive. Only one exhibits a porphyritic texture. Calcite veins and hematite bands near the top of the layer indicate that this was a period of degassing in the flow. It forms a thin band around the Rothea formation. The Carrow formation is a predominantly fine-grained redbed (consisting of typically red sedimentary rocks) unit that has a grade ranging from pebbles and cobble in conglomerate at the base to mudstone laced with calcrete at the top. The flow is littered with abundant flows from the Seelys (in the intercaldera sequence) and Rothea (earlier) formation towards the southeast, but in the north metasedimentary rocks, which are sedimentary rocks exhibiting metamorphosis, predominate. The lower part of the formation consists of unwelded and highly compacted lapilli tuff with abundant amounts of pumice fragments. A basalt and basalt-clad mudflow occurs near the top if the formation in some places. A dated locality from the top of the formation has been dated to the Late Devonian, around 350 million years ago. The exposed part of the formation forms a long band around the South Oromocto Andesite formation, and is colored brown on the map. The last formation in the later, the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation, is composed of porphyritic lava, and is characterized by an absence of angular crystals and pumice derivatives. In places its rhyolite composition intrudes older stratas. This layer is unique for it bridges the exocaldera and intracaldera sequences. A layer of saprolite (chemically weathered rock) separates the Bailey Rock Rhyolite formation from the overlying Caldera-Fill Sequence-era rocks. The exposed part of the flow overlies part of the Carrow formation, and is colored pink in the diagram above-right. =Intracaldera sequence= The Intercaldera Sequence is divided into, in ascending order, the Scoullar Mountain formation, Little Mount Pleasant formation, Seelys formation, and McDougall Brook Granite formation. In addition, there are felsic dykes and one mafic dyke that intrude the Scoullar Mountain and Little Mount Pleasant formations, respectively. The first sequence in the order is the Scoullar Mountain formation. The layer is characterized by sedimentary breccia and interbedded andesitic lava. In addition felsic pyroclastic rocks are very common in places and one sandstone-conglomerate lava flow can be found. The sedimentary breccia is dominated by pebble to boulder size angular metasedimentary stratas, and a few crystal tuff layers that contain about 1% biotite, the only such high amount of a typically trace mineral outside of Rothea formation in the Extracaldera sequence. A pumice-ridden lapilli-tuff section near the believed top section additionally has a 1% composition of the mineral amphibole. The exposed portion of the flows loosely flank the slopes of the volcano on the left and right, and are represented by bright orange on the map. The next layer is the Little Mount Pleasant formation, which is composed of crystal tuff and banded rhyolite. The tuff is characterized by, recrystallized pumice with microscopic crystals and amphibole. The crystal structure inside the pumice are larger than those outside, indicating that significant mechanical breakage during the eruption in which they were deposited. The exposed part of this layer is located around the southern base of the main caldera, and is colored ochre (light orange) on the diagram. The Seelys formation, next in the order, consists of lithic tuff and pumice- littered lithic lapilli-tuffs, banded, pumiceous, crystal tuff, and densely welded crystal tuff. The basalt contains clasts of both the Scoullar Mountain andesite and Little Mount Pleasant formation. Quartz and feldspar increase in size and abundance yoward the top. Biotite is virtually absent, but zircon is very common. The formation is colored the lightest orange on the map, and swathes across the main body of the caldera. The McDougall Brook Granite formation consists mostly of porphyritic granite, a borderline feldspar (sometimes quartz) porphyry, and minor amounts of fine-grained quartz monzonite. The grain size of the porphyry and the size and abundance of feldspar increases inward. Amphibole with apatite is the main mineral phase in all three of the flows. Parts of the feldspar porphyry are hydrothermally altered. The deposit is extensively exposed, and is colored red on the map. =Late Caldera-fill sequence= The Late Caldera-Fill sequence includes the Mount Pleasant Porphyry, the Big Scott Mountain formation, and the Kleef formation. The ages of the rocks are not well-established, but they are most likely Late Devonian and Mississippian. In addition the Intracaldera sequence is cut into multiple intrusions of varying origins. Many of the intrusions are thought to have formed without eruption, when mineral deposits \\"leaked.\\" The Mount Pleasant Porphyry formation occurs as dykes and small rock areas that have been associated with local breccia. The dyke structures seem to indicate multiple periods of intrusion. Two types of breccias have been identified, and older and more common felsic series, and a younger neutral phase. The porphyries making up the rocks were emplaced at the pre-existing volcanic margin. The Big Scott Mountain formation consists of rhyolite of variable composition, lapilli-tuff, and crystal tuff. Most of the rhyolites are characterized by large amounts of pyroxene. One rhyolite unit appears to overlie the McDougall Brook Granite formation. The tuff is littered by clasts from the Seelys and McDougall Brook Granite formations. The tuff also appears to be layered. It is colored dark orange on the map, and the exposed part partially rings the north of the volcano. The final formation, the Kleef formation, includes redbed, basalt and pumice-ridden tuff. Pebble to cobble sized conglomerate is also seen complementing the volcanic rock, and parts seem to come from older formations. The basalt is characterized by large crystals (up to ). The tuff are characterized by their reddish-brown color and abundant fossil-pumice. The formation is very rare exposed and of interest to economic geologists, as it contains many of the possibly gold-bearing intrusive areas. It is colored light blue on the map. Mining Indium wire. The rare element, used in flat-panel televisions, computers and smart phones, is one of the key mined resources at Mount Pleasant. Mount Pleasant has a long history of exploration and development in mining. Tin was first discovered on the mountain in 1937. The focus of exploration over the years has shifted from tin-base metals to porphyry tungsten-molybdenum-bismuth deposits, and then to porphyry tin deposits, and now indium, a rare element that is important to new technologies such as LCD screens and solar cells, computers and smart phones. The Mount Pleasant mine is located south of Fredericton, the provincial capital. The mining company Adex Mining Inc. holds 102 prospective claims covering approximately 1,600 hectares (4,000 acres) and 405 hectares (1,000 acres) of surface rights at Mount Pleasant, dominating the local extraction rights. It is situate close to infrastructure and potential employees. With a population of 50,000, Fredericton is important to the mine, as is Saint John, with a population of 70,000, which lies about o the southeast. Mount Pleasant is also only from the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border. When the mine was last producing - 1983 to 1985 - tungsten ore was regularly transported through Saint John by means of a provincial highway for shipment to Europe. The mine site is accessible via all-weather roads from Fredericton, Saint John and St. George. Electricity is provided by the New Brunswick transmission grid and water from a pump house located on the nearby Piskahegan River. On September 25, 2005, the Society of Economic Geologists hosted a small field trip to the caldera and the nearby Mount Pleasant Mine and Clarence stream deposit. The trip was divided into three stages: the Mount Pleasant Caldera, the Mount Pleasant Mine, and the Clarence Stream deposits. The field crew described two trenches that seemed to outline the relationship between the volcanic rock and the possibly gold-rich intrusive areas. On June 25, 2008, Geodex Minerals Ltd., a gold venture firm, announced the results of a 2007 - early 2008 diamond drilling program on the west side of Mount Pleasant. Along with the development of the Sisson Brook tungsten-molybdenum-copper project north of Fredericton, the area surrounding the former Mount Pleasant mine has been a major focus of the company. Research is ongoing, and focuses on the two most likely candidates: the McDougall Brook Granitic suite (MBG) and the Mount Pleasant Granitic suite (MPG). In June 2011, the owners moved their corporate offices from Toronto to Fredericton with the intent of refocusing efforts onto getting the mine running again by 2012.

As part of their doctoral dissertation project, they intended to develop a paradigm for evaluating alternative secondary schools, and study the effectiveness of curriculum choices.

The name is taken from Henry David Thoreau's Walden, because of Thoreau's commitments to experimentalism and individuality, and the numbering references behavioral psychologist B.F. Skinner's utopian novel, Walden Two. During its first three years, the school admitted only 11th and 12th grade students. In 1975, 10th grade and a middle school (at the time grades 7 through 9) were both added; and due to district changes in 1983, 6th grade was added to middle school and 9th grade moved to high school.  Buildings  Walden's original location was the McMynn Building on 7th Street in downtown Racine. This school, named in honor of John G. McMynn, was originally built in 1903 to serve grammar school students in the city's second ward. After being used as an annex to Racine High School in the 1910s, the school board sold it and it then served a variety of purposes, including a ration board office during World War II and as part of the Racine Technical Institute. The building returned to the school district in 1972, when it was purchased to house Walden. In 1975, it was demolished, and on its site McMynn Towers, an apartment complex for senior citizens, now stands.Fennell, George D. Racine, Arcadia Publishing, 2014.Racine History - Postcards, vindustries.com. After the demolition of the McMynn Building in 1975, the Walden program moved into a then-vacant Franklin School Building at 1012 Center Street, between the city's Midtown and School Section neighborhoods. The original part of this building (the Franklin Elementary School Building), making up what would be known as the \\"West Wing\\", was constructed in September 1869Burckel, Nicholas C.

This school was first known as the Third Ward grammar school, but within its first year the city changed its ward boundaries and it became the Sixth Ward grammar school. The first expansion to this building was made in 1899, doubling its capacity by adjoining an identical six-room structure, and when the school reopened in September it was renamed Franklin school. The school was further expanded with the construction of a new wing opened in 1921, where the new Franklin Junior High School was located alongside Franklin Elementary School. These wings are connected by a breezeway, frequently used as an alternate entrance for students attending after-school activities.

Curriculum and programs  The Rite of Passage Experience (ROPE) is a graduation requirement completed by all seniors, and is the oldest comprehensive graduation portfolio in the United States. In the first two quarters, students are required to make a career portfolio showcasing their knowledge, talents and personality. This portfolio includes an autobiography, a reflective essay on a piece of literature, a r√©sum√©, letters of recommendation, and proof in various forms that the student meets both the requirements set out by the school district and additional, more rigorous requirements set by Walden III. Students must demonstrate mastery in eleven subject areas by giving presentations about topics from each. During the second two quarters, students are required to write a thesis on a topic of their choice. All of these are presented orally to the student's ROPE committee, composed of the two faculty members and a junior year student.Archbald, Doug A. and Fred M.

In January 1965, Sir Henry and his Butlers expanded the band (Ole Bredahl, Torben Sardorf, Arne Schr√∏der) with Tommy Seebach (organ and, vocals), who at the time was only 15 years old. He would become very popular and together with Ole Bredahl they made up the front figures of the band. The same year the band changed record label to EMI and achieved a number of hits, among others: Times Are Getting Hard, Beautiful Brown Eyes and \\"Marianne\\", which were all released in 1966. During the autumn of 1967, the single \\"Camp\\" was released and became an international hit, especially in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. The song was an instrumental track where the main instrument was the comb and paper. It was later used in an advertisement for the chocolate Rolo. The distinctly odd B-side song, \\"Pretty Style\\", featured sitar and psychedelic multi-tracked guitar and vocals. During the years after Tommy Seebach joined the group the band changed its style. Originally their music was replicas of English beat music but this changed to a more original pop sound with songs that was composed by the members of the band themselves, primarily Ole Bredahl and Tommy Seebach. This new musical style ended up becoming an LP which was released in 1968 with the name H2O. In 1970, the band's name was shortened to Sir Henry. Two years later, Ole Steen Nielsen was replaced by Claus Asmussen, former The Noblemen and later Shu-bi-dua. This constellation recorded and released the 10-year anniversary album Listen in 1973. Ole Bredahl and Tommy Seebach decided in 1975 to reorganise the group together with Torben Johansen (guitar) and John Roger (drums); the latter was a former member of Teenmakers. The same year, the four recorded the album Flashback. During that year, Tommy Seebach began a solo career which would become very successful. Due to that success, Tommy Seebach chose to leave the group in 1977. The same year, Ole Bredahl recorded a solo LP with the title of Tivoli/O. Henry on which there are feature some of the popular Sir Henry songs. The success was not on the same scale as for Tommy Seebach. Following this, Sir Henry was re-established several times by Ole Bredahl but without major success, though they had a minor hit in 1980 with the song \\"Juicy Lucy\\", where Sir Henry consisted of Ole Bredahl, S√∏ren Bundg√•rd (keyboard), Kurt Bo Jensen (guitar) and Ole Carsten Juul (drums) (was later replaced by Sten Kristensen in 1983). At the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix in 1983, they participated as backing group for Kirsten Siggaard with the song \\"Og livet g√•r\\". The next year, S√∏ren Bundg√•rd and Kirsten Siggaard again participated in the Danish Melodi Grand Prix as the duo Hot Eyes with the song \\"Det' Lige Det\\", with which they won. The same year, Sir Henry (and his Butlers) was dissolved.

It is a mature work set in a small city in the United States around the early 1980s. Plot summary Ciudades Desiertas is the story of Susana, a female Mexican writer fleeing her home to attend an international workshop in the United States, leaving her husband Eligio behind and completely unaware of her whereabouts. A hot-tempered intellectual with a somewhat cynical and misanthropic sense of humor, he works his way to catch up with his wife, arguing to have only done so to find out why exactly Susana left. The book's title seems to be derived from the couple's separate observations in regards to the apparent lack of movement around Arcadia, where the workshop takes place. They almost immediately suffer a cultural shock upon their arrival, although they are already well acquainted with the typical American lifestyle. The American residents, with a small town mentality, are depicted as largely more ignorant of the visitors' culture and society; whereas the latter, especially Latin Americans, show a contemptuous reluctance to try and fit in, perhaps Susana being the most remarkable exception. Throughout their journey, both try to pinpoint their relationship's setbacks, as well as their own flaws. The two attempt to show a sense of individuality and emotional disattachment from their spouse, each according to their respective point of view. While Eligio tries to make sense out of things, halfway acknowledging the extent of his feelings for his wife, still paradoxically giving in to outbursts of rage on occasions; Susana strains to convey an ideal of utter independence, as she feels the routine of her marriage holds her back. Motivated at first to prove her own self-worth, which she does find, she eventually experiences the certainty of her love for Eligio, in spite of all her efforts to stay away from him. Relationship between Mexico and the USA Susana and Eligio criticize each other throughout the novel for characteristics that they have in common. Eligio, for example, is bothered by Susana‚Äôs feminist traits, while Susana constantly points out Eligio‚Äôs macho attitude ‚Äì a term whose connotation is stronger than the word ‚Äúchauvinist.‚Äù Implicitly, one of their greatest complaints is that the other person is more interested in their self. An example of this is the opinions that they have toward the respective times that they spend with each other‚Äôs incompetent friends. Also, both accuse each other of seeking self-autonomy even though they are married; however, even though they want independence, they search for each other in different countries, and both seem to accept their spouse after being abandoned. Eligio condemns his wife for having a relationship with Slawomir and then has a relationship with one of the authors. The ultimate paradoxical representation is presented in the last chapter when he spanks his wife after she returns to Mexico. The comical action and the submissive behavior are contrary to both characters.  Feminism  Jos√© Agust√≠n uses the idea of feminism to create interaction among characters in Ciudades Desiertas. Susana is in a relationship with Eligio, and at one point Susana tries to express herself openly about societal issues. Eligio then hits her as a means to control her due to his machismo on-look he learned from Mexico. Many Latin American societies in the past set norms for women, and felt it was out of place that women talk back or give their opinion. Women did not have the right to express concerns about aspects that occurred within their society. Using contemporary writing, Agust√≠n is able to show a reader the thought and opinions of women through character interaction. The world has changed, and Latin American countries have to realize that. Women have to adapt their role within society as a means to survive where there is a need that they must work outside the home to help support the family. Culturally, countries get set in their ways and forget that the world is a different place than it was in the past. Women, such as Susana, must be able to voice their opinion because they too can help a country to better economically just as men can. It may be difficult for Eligio, and other men in Latin American countries to accept change, but women too our people that should be respected and that can have an impact. Agust√≠n shows that the tension between men and women exits today because men feel they are losing control. Feminism helps to argue women are not objects, and that they are people who deserve respect and have an impact in society. In conclusion, the role of women is changing to meet the changes of a new and modernizing world, and Latin American countries must accept that. Literary significance and criticism In this book, the term \\"machismo\\" seems to be a territorial term. That is, it is only effective in certain situations and certain territories. Eligio, the traditional ‚Äúmachista‚Äù, finds himself struggling to rescue his wife. After arriving to the United States, Susana seems to reverse roles; she gains more independence making her less dependable on Eligio. This is something very different from what used to happen in their native country of Mexico. Back home, Eligio was able to suppress his companion with his ‚Äúmachista‚Äù traits. He would drink all the time and ignore Susana‚Äôs complaints. All these bad treatments were allowed because of his material and emotional control. This attitude forced Susana to depart toward the U.S. There, she reverses the roles, when Eligio arrives, she is now in control, she owns her own place, she has no dependence on him, rather, he is the one staying in her property and obeying her rules. Also, her emotional side seems to be filled by another participant of the program she attends, Slawomir. As a result, Eligio is no longer needed for emotional purposes. This situation and control is challenged by his ‚Äúmachista‚Äù husband; who tries to employ the same ‚Äúmachista‚Äù attitude to get her back on his side. Nevertheless, he fails due to his territorial powers. He is no longer the nucleus of the relation. In the United States Susana has no dependency on him; she can live fine with or without him. Consequently, Eligio chooses to return to his native land. His ‚Äúmachismo‚Äù dies in the United States, and it is only revived, at the end, once they both return to Mexico. It is a way to show the differences that exist between American and Mexican culture.

Prov. 5.50 or Polyrrhenium, was a town and polis (city- state) in the northwest of ancient Crete, whose territory occupied the whole western extremity of the island, extending from north to south. It was an important Archaic Period settlement co-temporaneous with Lato and Prinias.C. Michael Hogan, \\"Lato Fieldnotes\\", The Modern Antiquarian, Jan 10, 2008 Strabo describes it as lying west of Cydonia, at the distance of 30 stadia from the sea, and 60 from Phalasarna, and as containing a temple of Dictynna. He adds that the Polyrrhenians formerly dwelt in villages, and that they were collected into one place by the Achaeans and Lacedaemonians, who built a strong city looking towards the south. In the civil wars in Crete in the time of the Achaean League, 219 BCE, the Polyrrhenians, who had been subject allies of Cnossus, deserted the latter, and assisted the Lyctians against that city. They also sent auxiliary troops to the assistance of the Achaeans, because the Cnossians had supported the Aetolians. In a successful campaign they prevented their rival cities Cnossus and Gortys from dominating the entire island and brought a large part over to the Macedonian coalition. Polyrrhenia continued to flourish in the Roman period, when the center shifted to its erstwhile port, Cisamus, and in this urbanistic configuration lasted into Byzantine times. A small town now occupies the site, where rock-cut tombs, ruins and an acropolis remain. A Roman aqueduct built in the age of Hadrian improved water supplies. The ruins of Polyrrhenia, have been discovered at a place called Epano Palaiokastro in the Chania regional unit. It is some 7 km inland from modern Kissamos. A village of the same name has been established nearby, and the ruins are an archaeological site.

Siemering (born October 26, 1934) is a radio innovator and advocate. He was a member of the founding board of NPR and the author of its original \\"mission statement,\\" the National Public Radio Purposes. As NPR's first director of programming Siemering helped shaped its flagship program All Things Considered into an influential and enduring fixture of American media. After a decades-long career in public radio, Siemering embarked on a second career of nurturing independent radio in the developing world. Early life William H. Siemering working as an announcer at WHA in 1956 William Siemering grew up in rural Wisconsin. As a student in a two-room school outside of Madison, he listened to the \\"Wisconsin School of the Air.\\" These twice-a-day radio programs produced by WHA brought educators from the University of Wisconsin into isolated country schools throughout the state.Davidson, Randall (2007). 9XM Talking: WHA Radio and the Wisconsin Idea. University of Wisconsin Press. Siemering would later observe: \\"As early as first grade, radio both educated me and spurred my imagination.\\" Siemering's appreciation of radio increased during his high school years as he witnessed first-hand the importance of WHA's daily farm program while working summers baling hay and harvesting grain. He changed from listener to active participant when he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and worked his way through school at WHA as a board operator, announcer, and newscaster. Siemering would later remark, \\"WHA had become the statewide Wisconsin Educational Radio Network, and I saw how it linked the state through its programming.\\" Public Radio Career=WBFO In 1963, William Siemering became the first professional general manager of WBFO, the student radio station at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo. He was hired by Richard Siggelkow, a former faculty member at UW, who was now the Dean of Students. Siggelkow protected the journalistic integrity of the station and gave the new manager total freedom to transform it. Like most college radio stations at the time, WBFO had been a student club limited to evening hours during the academic year. By the end of Siemerling's eight-year tenure, however, the station had substantially expanded its hours of operations and the professionalism of its staff. Howard Arenstein, Ira Flatow, Clifford Stoll and Henry Tenenbaum are among WBFO's notable alums. WBFO's programming became increasingly experimental and innovative during the late 1960s. It broadcast live events from a major arts festival, readings by local and visiting artists, and a program where art students discussed their creative process. One of the more remarkable experiments was City Links: Buffalo, 28-hour-long live performance piece by Maryann Amacher in which she mixed ambient sounds transmitted from five city locations. The politicization of the campus community during the Vietnam War increased the focus on the news at WBFO. This came to a head in during the student strike of March 1970. Protestors occupied the student center, police stormed the campus and tear gas was in the air. Nobody was talking to each other, but Warren Bennis, a vice president at the university, used an open mike from the station to start a dialog. Live coverage continued well into the night, during which WBFO interviewed student radicals, campus administrators, city officials and the police. \\"The idea,\\" Siemering reported, \\"was that there is not a single truth here.\\" The success of the strike coverage led Siemering to create This is Radio!, a WBFO magazine show that was later co-hosted by Terry Gross and served as a model for Fresh Air. \\"He [Siemering] opened mikes, put participants on the air and talked to them,\\" David Benders, a 33-year veteran at WBFO, recalls, \\"It was the first modern- day talk show‚Äîit started something new.\\" William Siemering's tenure at WBFO was also marked by an extraordinary outreach to Buffalo's African-American community. Shortly upon his arrival in 1963, Siemering canvassed the community and produced a radio series titled To be Negro, but the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 prompted a different approach. After meetings during which blacks aired their grievances regarding the Media, Siemering established a satellite station in the heart of the city. Volunteers from the community‚Äînone of whom with prior experience in radio‚Äîplanned and produced 28 hours of programming for WBFO that ranged from a children's program to one on avant-garde jazz, as well as community discussions ranging from school busing to drug addiction. A number of the staff went on to successful careers in commercial radio and TV. NPR Broadcasting in the United States was dominated by three commercial networks during most of the 20th century, but this landscape changed with the passing of The Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). By providing financial assistance to producers of educational programming through the CPB, the act enabled them to provide both diversity and excellence to a wider audience. Originally conceived exclusively for public television, the act also called for the creation of public radio. By this time, William Siemering had become an influential thinker on the role and potential of public radio. It wouldn't be staid like much of educational radio nor would it be superficial as was often the case for commercial radio. He argued for authenticity, depth and the thoughtful exchange of diverse perspectives and ideas. Moreover, Siemering argued for the imaginative power of sound in radio. It could be more than television without pictures. In late 1969, Siemering joined Joe Gwathmey of KUT, Benard Mayes of KQED, Karl Schmidt of WHA and five other educational radio station managers to comprise the founding board of directors for National Public Radio (NPR). They decided that public radio needed a distinctive daily program that would attract audiences and provide the new network with a unique identity. The board assigned the task of writing the Mission and Goals statement, the National Public Radio Purposes, to William Siemering. Parts of this statement were later read to Don Quayle during his interview to become NPR's first president. When asked if he could implement it, Quayle responded, \\"Yes, if I can hire the man who wrote it.\\" As NPR's first director of programming, Siemering was entrusted with developing the distinctive daily program that would help define the fledgling organization. Informed by his experience with This is Radio! at WBFO, he wanted a flexible magazine format that would mix news, art and culture in a fashion that would be engaging, creative and conversational. It would \\"reflect the diversity of America and let the country hear itself.\\" The program, All Things Considered, debuted on May 3, 1971. It opened with the quiet, conversational and unscripted voice of its first host, Robert Conley, followed by a first-person account of heroin addiction, an interview with an enterprising barber in Iowa, and a dramatic and evocative 20-minute sound montage of the massive anti-war demonstration that gripped Washington, D.C., earlier that day. Far from formulaic, All Things Considered experienced more than its share of stumbles and missteps. The program, however, began to gel after Jack W. Mitchell assumed the day-to-day responsibilities of running the program. Its voice also developed, most notably with the addition of Susan Stamberg as co-host. After a rocky first year, All Things Considered achieved credibility and won recognition, including the Peabody Award in 1972. Nonetheless, Don Quayle, presumably dissatisfied with Siemering's personnel practices and management style, fired him that December. Minnesota Public Radio Bill King, the president of Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), offered William Siemering a fresh start in public radio. The network had opened KCCM, a new station based in Moorhead. Siemering was to develop the station, feed local news and features to MPR and get the station CPB-qualified (Corporation for Public Broadcasting). The opportunity offered him considerable autonomy in developing programs, and, because Moorhead was located on Minnesota's western border with North Dakota, it represented something of a return to his rural roots. Programming at KCCM reflected many of Siemering's ideas for public radio. Home for the Weekend was weekly program that explored everything from the American Dream and what is a caring community to the best feed for cows. Our Home Town was an extended series of sound portraits of six small towns in North Dakota. KCCM even set up a listening post at a local mall where citizens could voice their opinions on current issues and interact with public officials. Siemering also kept true to his pattern of hiring energetic and capable people despite their lack of radio experience. Three of these hires, Marcia Alvar, Dennis Hamilton and John Ydstie, went on to have successful careers in public radio. One of Siemering's goals at Moorhead was to contribute 52 pieces to NPR during the course of a year. He achieved that goal. He was also elected to NPR's Board as a petition candidate and participated in policy-making decisions over a ten-year period. Siemering's stint at KCCM was followed by a year as vice president for programming at MPR in St. Paul. He then moved to Philadelphia to take on a different kind of challenge. WHYY-FM In 1978, WHYY-FM (then known as WUHY-FM) was an underperforming public radio station with one of the largest potential audiences in the country. As its new station manager (later retitled as the Vice President for Radio), William Siemering oversaw the sustained growth of the station's audience and operations, the expansion its news staff and the development of its programming. He helped develop a successful local show, Fresh Air, hosted by Terri Gross, into the third most listened program on NPR and created Radio Times with Marty Moss-Coanne. Siemering left WHYY in 1987. Soundprint William Siemering incorporated music, sound and compelling storytelling into radio programming since his days at WBFO and also played a key role in crafting NPR's distinctive sound. He further nurtured the medium's possibilities when he served as the first executive producer of (1987-1992) and driving force behind Soundprint. Originally conceived by documentarians Jay Allison and Larry Massat, Soundprint is a weekly series of independently produced radio documentaries produced at WJHU-FM in Baltimore and aired on NPR stations. It's the longest-running documentary series in public radio, and has won numerous national and international awards. International Media Development=South Africa William Siemering's first international foray came at the behest of the U.S. State Department. In 1993, he was invited to meet with two groups. The first was interested in reforming the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), which, until then, had been the mouthpiece of the Apartheid government. The second was interested in starting community radio stations as part of the liberation struggle. Open Society Institute That same year, Siemering received the prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. Money was tight during this period so this funding provided key support for him to do further work in developing community radio for emerging democracies. He returned to South Africa the following year, this time with the Open Society Foundation for South Africa, and in 1995 as a Knight International Journalism Fellow. Siemering continued his collaboration with the Open Society Institute through 2003 with projects in several eastern European countries, Mongolia, Mozambique as well as South Africa. These efforts included developing guidelines for funding and capacity building, including organizing training programs, attendance at professional conferences and visits to radio stations in the United States. Two themes emerged during this period. One was the sustainability of community radio. The financial, technical and infrastructural requirements for starting and maintaining a station may be substantially lower that they are for a newspaper, a television station or an internet outlet, but the challenges to keep them operational are daunting, especially in the poor communities where they are most needed. Financial sustainability is the most obvious, and it tends to receive‚Äîunderstandably‚Äîthe most attention. Other attributes, however, also are crucial to a station's sustainability. These include clarity of purpose, open relationships with stakeholders, a reputation for journalistic integrity and independence, ongoing evaluation of programming, and a sense of ownership by the community The other theme was the unrealized potential of radio itself. Despite the fact that it has extraordinary reach in impoverished and marginalized regions with high illiteracy, radio was often overlooked by donors and development organizations. When it was considered, more often than not, it was regarded more as a loudspeaker for their public service announcements than as a tool for change. Developing Radio Partners William H Siemering with producers of the youth program at Nkhotakota Community Radio in Malawi In 2003, William Siemering founded the nonprofit Developing Radio Partners (DRP) with the expressed purpose of using radio to improve the flow of information to those who need it the most and are the hardest to reach. To achieve this, DRP works with local radio stations that have independent voices and explicit development objectives. DRP core service provided local stations with a comprehensive and customized training program called Healthy Stations. These trainings, building upon the ideas sustainable community radio, covered topics such as station management, programming, journalistic standards, community engagement and ongoing evaluation. More recently, DRP has provided information in the form of weekly bulletins on topics ranging from conservation farming to energy efficient stoves as well as assessments of the local media landscape for international development organizations interested in capacity building for local media. Through DRP, Siemering has worked with independent radio stations in countries ranging from Mongolia to Sierra Leone. In the latter, DRP partnered with Search for Common Ground and others to help develop independent media in a country devastated by a 10-year civil war. In turn, the Independent Radio Network played a major role in an exceptionally transparent and peaceful national election in 2007. Recent efforts include projects on best practices for agriculture in response to climate change in Cameroon, Cape Verde, Rwanda and Zambia, and on youth and reproductive health in Malawi. Wyncote Foundation William Siemering, left Developing Radio Partners at the end of 2017. He is currently Senior Fellow with the Wyncote Foundation.

It was named after the Scottish island Colonsay. James Mendenhall, born November 26, 1718, in East Caln, Chester County, Pennsylvania, settled near what is now Jamestown, North Carolina, in 1762 and built a mill on the Deep River at a location that is now within City Lake Park. His original land is now under the water of High Point Lake in Guilford County. His mill was just from the site of the Battle of Guilford Court House. British troops camped at his mill on March 14, 1781, the day before battle. Due to the persecutions of Governor Tyrone, Mendenhall and his family were forced to move again. He bought near Wrightsboro, Georgia on December 7, 1773, when a warrant of survey was granted to him by Governor James Wright. The land was located in the fork of Williams Creek and the Little River, in the extreme northeast corner of what was then Wilkes County. Mendenhall went to Wrightsboro with two of his sons, Phineas and Marmaduke. He was unable to take possession of his grant on Williams Creek because he died shortly after his arrival. He died in the cabin 1782 in Wrightsboro that he had built there and was buried on his land. This land is now in Taliaferro County. On July 27, 1784, Marmaduke inherited a tract of from his father. It was almost square. Starting with the junction of Williams Creek with the Little River, the line followed the river northwardly for about a mile. Turning, it ran a mile straight westward, then a mile, with only a slight dog- leg, southward to join Williams Creek, whose course it followed for another mile until it reached its starting point at the fork of the two streams. In 1789‚Äì1790, Marmaduke built a substantial house which apparently was designed as an inn, trading post and stage coach stop on the road from Washington to Wrightsboro. It had two stories and consisted of two large rooms 20 √ó 20 feet, one over the other. The inside chimney was flanked on one side by a cupboard and on the other by a narrow winding staircase. This staircase was peculiar in that at a height of eight feet it made a complete semicircle. Another circular staircase directly above this led into the loft. The roof sloped down directly over the staircase so that one had to crawl in order to enter the loft. The open beams were all hand-hewn, and all joints were mortised and tenoned and secured with wooden pegs. Both rooms were paneled with wide boards of virgin pine, dark brown and mellowed with the passing years. The house is still standing and occupied. It is owned by Ian Mcfie. Before Ian McFie, the home and 540 of the original were owned by his father Girdwood Mcfie. Girdwood maintained the farm animals in exactly the same numbers as listed in the inventory of Marmaduke's estate in 1797.

Anomabu has a settlement population of 14,389 people. History Annamaboe's origins are cloudy, but the town rose to prominence in the 17th century. The Fante merchants there traded primarily in gold and grain. After inviting the Dutch to build a factory in town, the merchants turned increasingly towards the slave trade. Wealthy Fante merchants supported the building of an English fort to further this cause. However, the loss of the Royal African Company's monopoly in 1698 led to the closing of the fort in 1730. Under pressure from increasing French interest, the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa moved to rebuild the fort.Sparks, Randy. \\"Where the Negroes are Masters.\\" Harvard University Press, 2014, p. 4. Fort William, also known as Anomabu Castle, was designed by the British engineer John Apperley and constructed between 1753 and 1760. At the time it was considered to be the strongest fortification on the coast. It is about from Cape Coast Castle. After his death in 1756, Anglo- Irishman Richard Brew took over the Governorship of the fort and continued its construction. The Anomabu fort became the center of British slave trading along the Gold Coast until the practice was outlawed in 1807. In the same year, a small garrison successfully resisted the entire Ashanti army, although the city suffered greatly from the attack. In the later 19th century, it exported in palm oil, ivory, gold dust, peanuts, and Guinea grains in exchange for considerable imports of manufactured goods. Its population in the 1870s was around 4500. Originally a small fishing village, Annamaboe eventually became one of the most important trading ports on the Gold Coast. By the 18th century, the town had become one of the largest exporters of slaves on the West Coast of Africa. In 1798, people who would be enslaved were embarked on the Antelope ship which had come from London. Tourism In modern times, Anomabu is a popular tourist destination. The remains of Fort William are still visible.Ghana Slave Forts Festivals The people of Anomabo celebrate the Okyir festival which is a week-long annual festival celebrated in the second week in the month of October. \\"Okyir\\" means \\"abomination\\" and the people celebrate this festival as a reminder of society's social vices.

He served as President of Colombia a total of eleven times, the most terms any president has served to date. He is also credited for creating the Republic of New Granada after the division of Venezuela and Ecuador.  Biographic data  Caycedo was born in Santa Fe de Bogot√° on August 4, 1783. He died in Puente Aranda, near Bogot√°, on July 1, 1843.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 31, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983  Early life  Caycedo studied Law in the Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario (now known as Universidad del Rosario) in Bogot√°, where he later became vice-rector (deputy headmaster). At an early age, he decided not to practice law, and instead pursued military and political activities. He later became a general in the army and then president of the country. He traveled to Spain, where he joined the army to fight against Napoleon. He also worked as a secretary in the Spanish Cortes (Congress).  Military career  Upon learning of the events of July 20, 1810, Caycedo returned to America with Vicente Bol√≠var, brother of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the future ‚ÄúLibertador‚Äù and first president of Colombia. Caycedo enlisted in the Colombian revolutionary army. He became a member of the Advisory Council to General Antonio Nari√±o. He fought in the battles of ‚Äúla Cuchilla del Tambo‚Äù y ‚Äúla Plata‚Äù, where he was arrested by Spanish troops. He was court-martialed as a prisoner of war, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to death. His life was spared thanks to the influence of his father-in-law, his wife Juana Jurado y Bertendona, and some monetary payments to the Spanish authorities. He was freed under probation and vanished from the war theatre until the revolutionary triumph at the Battle of Boyac√° (Puente de Boyac√°) on August 7, 1819.  Political career  Once again, after the revolutionary triumph of August 7, 1819, Caycedo returned to public life under the protection of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. In 1827 he was appointed as Governor of Neiva, elected to Congress, and ascended to General of the Army. He became part of the inner circle of Bol√≠var, who appointed him as Secretary of the Interior in 1829 and a year later as Secretary of State. Afterward, Caycedo was appointed as president of the ‚ÄúConsejo de Estado‚Äù (the precursor of the Supreme Court) to replace the retiring Jos√© Mar√≠a Castillo y Rada, who decided to become a member of Congress of the Gran Colombia.  The Presidency  On April 1, 1830, President Bol√≠var took a leave of absence from Bogot√° to the Hacienda of Fucha to recover from an illness. Caycedo assumed the Office of Interim President. This would be the first of several occasions in which he acted as President in this capacity.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 32, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 Later that same year, when Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, the Founding Father, irrevocably resigned the presidency, Congress elected Don Joaqu√≠n de Mosquera as president and Caycedo as vice president. Because Mosquera was very ill and frail, Caycedo assumed the executive power as acting president on August 2, 1830. Caycedo was deposed by the first coup d‚Äô√©tat in the country, by the Venezuelan General Rafael Urdaneta on September 5, 1830. Months later, supported by the regrouped constitutional army, Caycedo proclaimed he was the legitimate president on April 11, 1831. He contacted General Urdaneta and invited him to a summit to discuss the future of the nation's government. Urdaneta accepted, and on April 28, 1831, they met at Juntas de Apulo, near the town of Tocaima. They both reached an agreement and signed the Accord of Apalo, by which General Urdaneta recognized Caycedo as acting president. Thus, Caycedo, once again, took office on May 3, 1831. Caycedo, as acting president, convened Congress. On November 15, 1831, Congress elected General Francisco de Paula Santander as president and General Jos√© Mar√≠a Obando as vice president.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 33, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 A few years later Caycedo was elected to Congress, appointed Secretary of the Treasury. Caycedo would act as interim president for the six times president Jos√© Ignacio de M√°rquez who would be absent from office for short periods of time. During the presidency of Pedro Alc√°ntara Herr√°n (1841-1845), Caycedo acted as interim president twice during temporary absences by the president.

It follows Iris, a young, plain-looking factory worker living a lonely, impoverished and uneventful life in late 1980s Finland. Iris is played by Kati Outinen, who had appeared in a number of other Kaurism√§ki films. Plot Iris lives with her middle-aged mother and stepfather, who spend their time watching the news and television and expect her to give them all of her match factory production line job earnings and to do all the housework. She goes to dances but does not attract partners. She buys a highly coloured dress in the hope that this will increase her appeal. Her parents, seeing it, call her a whore and demands she return it but she defied them and wears it to a dance club. At the club she meets Aarne, who thinks she is a prostitute because of the dress, although Iris does not realize that. They spend the night together at his plush apartment, and Aarne leaves the next morning before Iris awakes, leaving money for her on the bedside table. Iris leaves her number and, after waiting in vain for Aarne to 'phone her, visits him and arranges a second date. Arne meets her parents when he calls for her. At the end of the dinner, Aarne harshly informs her that he does not seek her affection and tells her to leave. She returns home and spends the rest of the evening in tears. Iris later discovers she is pregnant, and writes to Aarne asking him to raise the child with her. She receives a reply simply stating \\"Get rid of the brat,\\" along with a cheque for 10,000 markka. Iris becomes distraught and goes outside, leaving the letter and cheque on the table, where her mother finds them. While wandering around upset, Iris is hit by a car and has a miscarriage. Her stepfather visits Iris in the hospital and tells her she must move out of the apartment because she has caused her mother great pain. Iris moves in with her brother and becomes increasingly despondent. She buys rat poison, mixes it with water, and puts it into a small bottle, which she puts into her purse. She goes to Aarne's apartment and tells him she wants a drink. Aarne brings the drinks, but Iris asks for ice, and when Aarne goes to get it, Iris pours some of the mixture into his drink. When Aarne returns, she tells him that everything is taken care of and that he need not worry because this will be the last time he will see her. She returns his cheque, quickly drinks most of her drink, and leaves. Aarne sits quietly for a few moments, then drinks his drink. On the way home, Iris goes into a bar, orders a beer, takes a seat at the bar, and starts reading. A man sits beside her, uninvited, and tries to catch her attention. Iris smiles at the man, takes the poison out and pours some into his glass. She leaves, and the man finishes his drink. Iris visits her mother and stepfather. She prepares a meal for them and pours the rest of the poison into their bottle of vodka while they are next door. While they eat, Iris sits in the living room smoking and listening to music. After a while, she gets up to look and sees her parents are dead. The next day at work, Iris is taken away by the police. CastRelease=Critical response On August 18, 2011, Roger Ebert added the film to his list of Great Movies. Ebert wrote that he \\"watched hypnotically. Few films are ever this unremittingly unyielding... What made it more mesmerizing is that it's all on the same tonal level: Iris passively endures a series of humiliations, cruelties and dismissals.\\" Home media The Match Factory Girl was released on a region-free Blu-ray by Future Film in Finland on December 3, 2013.

Life and work Leyda was born on February 12, 1910, in Detroit, Michigan. He was a member of the Workers Film and Photo League in the early 1930s. He traveled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to study filmmaking at State Film Institute, Moscow, with Sergei Eisenstein, who had a troubled relationship with Stalin and the Soviet film bureaucracy. He participated in the filming of Eisenstein's lost film Bezhin Meadow (1935‚Äì37). When he returned to the United States in 1936 to become an assistant film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, he brought the only complete print of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin. In the 1940s he translated Eisenstein's writings. Although he did not have a Ph.D., Leyda became fascinated with Herman Melville and became an important figure in the Melville revival. These scholars moved beyond the acceptance of Melville's first-person accounts in his works as reliably autobiographical. To provide concrete evidence, Leyda searched libraries, family papers, local archives and newspapers across New England and New York to gather The Melville Log (1951) to document Melville's day to day activities and transactions. Leyda‚Äôs wife, Si-Lan Chen, a ballet dancer of international reputation, was the daughter of Eugene Chen, a colleague of the Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat- sen. Leyda was invited in 1959 to work at the Film Archive of China in Beijing, where he stayed until 1964. His account of Chinese film history, Dianying, was the first full length treatment to appear in English. Although he could use the basic (and now outdated) Chinese scholarship only in summary translations, Leyda‚Äôs knowledge of film gave him still useful insights into individual films and techniques.Jay Leyda, Dianying: An Account of Films and the Film Audience in China (Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1972), xii He was awarded the Eastman Kodak Gold Medal Award in 1984. He taught at Yale University (1969-1972), York University (1972‚Äì73) and New York University from 1973 until his death in New York on February 15, 1988, of heart failure.Andrew L.

Harpole (creator of the ten volume History of American Cinema, dedicated to Leyda); leading film theorist, Tom Gunning; and scholar-practitioner Charles Musser. In 1981 he was a member of the jury at the 12th Moscow International Film Festival. He co-curated (with Charles Musser) Before Hollywood: Turn of the Century American Film (1987) for the American Federation of Arts, a six-part touring program of American films with an accompanying catalog, which the New York Times called \\"A fascinating look at the cinema that flourished between 1895 and 1915 in America, before movies could be mentioned in family newspapers.\\" Selected filmography *A Bronx Morning (1931) (11 minutes, black and white, silent), in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. *People of the Cumberland (1937) (21 minutes, black and white, sound), co-directed by Sidney Meyers, also in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.

Other influences on the cuisine resulted from immigration from countries such as Germany and Britain. Uruguayan gastronomy is a result of immigration, rather than local Amerindian cuisine, because the new colonies did not trust the native Charr√∫a people. Spanish influences are very abundant: desserts like churros (cylinders of pastry, usually fried, sometimes filled with dulce de leche), flan, ensaimadas yoo (Catalan sweet bread), and alfajores were all brought from Spain. There are also all kinds of stews known as guisos or estofados, arroces (rice dishes such as paella), and fabada (Asturian bean stew). All of the guisos and traditional pucheros (stews) are also of Spanish origin. Uruguayan preparations of fish, such as dried salt cod (bacalao), calamari, and octopus, originate from the Basque and Galician regions, and also Portugal. Due to its strong Italian tradition, all of the famous Italian pasta dishes are present in Uruguay including ravioli, lasagne, tortellini, fettuccine, and the traditional gnocchi. Although the pasta can be served with many sauces, there is one special sauce that was created by Uruguayans. Caruso sauce is a pasta sauce made from double cream, meat, onions, ham and mushrooms. It is very popular with sorrentinos and agnolotti. Additionally, there is Germanic influence in Uruguayan cuisine as well, particularly in sweet dishes. The pastries known as bizcochos are Germanic in origin: croissants, known as medialunas, are the most popular of these, and can be found in two varieties: butter- and lard-based. Also German in origin are the Berlinese known as bolas de fraile (\\"friar's balls\\"), and the rolls called piononos. The facturas were re-christened with local names given the difficult German phonology, and usually Uruguayanized by the addition of a dulce de leche filling. Even dishes like chucrut (sauerkraut) have also made it into mainstream Uruguayan dishes. The base of the country's diet is meat and animal products: primarily beef but also chicken, lamb, pig and sometimes fish. The preferred cooking methods for meats and vegetables are still boiling and roasting, although modernization has popularized frying (see milanesas and chivitos). Meanwhile, wheat and fruit are generally served fried (torta frita and pasteles), comfited (rapadura and ticholos de banana), and sometimes baked (rosca de chicharrones), a new modern style. Bushmeat comes from mulitas and carpinchos. Regional fruits like butia and pitanga are commonly used for flavoring ca√±a, along with quinotos and n√≠speros. Although Uruguay has exuberant flora and fauna, with the exception of yerba mate, the rest of it is mostly still unused. Uruguayan food always comes with fresh bread; bizcochos and tortas fritas are a must for drinking mate ('tomar el mate'). Mate is the national drink. The dried leaves and twigs of the yerba mate plant (Ilex paraguariensis) are placed in a small cup. Hot water is then poured into a gourd just below the boiling point, to avoid burning the herb and spoiling the flavor. The drink is sipped through a metal or reed straw, known as a bombilla. Wine is also a popular drink. Other spirits consumed in Uruguay are ca√±a, grappa, lemon-infused grappa, and grappamiel (a grappa honey liquour). Grappamiel is very popular in rural areas, and is often consumed in the cold autumn and winter mornings to warm up the body. Popular sweets are membrillo quince jam and dulce de leche, which is made from carmelized milk. A sweet paste, dulce de leche, is used to fill cookies, cakes, pancakes, milhojas, and alfajores. The alfajores are shortbread cookies sandwiched together with dulce de leche or a fruit paste. Dulce de leche is used also in flan con dulce de leche. A typical Uruguayan parrillero milanesa a caballo Bacalao typically served on Semana Santa (Easter). chivito with lettuce, tomato, thin filet steak, bacon, ham, mushrooms, olives, mozzarella cheese, onion, egg, and garlic mayonnaise on a bun without sesame seeds Common dishes * Asado: both the tradition of grilling beef over coals (which translates to barbecue in American English), and the dish, tira de asado. * Chivito: a sandwich containing steak, ham, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and mayonnaise. * Chorip√°n: a very popular Uruguayan fast food - A grilled chorizo and a crusty bread such as a baguette, usually served with chimichurri sauce. * Empanada: a small pie or turnover, most commonly filled with meat, such as ham and cheese. * Empanada Gallega: a fish pie, with sauce, onions and bell peppers. Brought by immigrants from Galicia. * Fain√°: a mix of chickpea flour, salt, water and olive oil, originally called \\"farinata\\", cooked like a pizza on a flat tray. Brought by immigrants from Liguria (Italy). * Pancho: a typical Uruguayan hot dog - a bun called \\"pan de Vienna\\" filled with a \\"hot dog\\" with mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise or salsa golf on top. * Gnocchi (known as \\"√±oquis\\") are traditionally eaten on the 29th day of each month. This was the day before payday when people were at their poorest. Gnocchi made a cheap and hearty meal. On these occasions, some people leave a coin or a banknote under the plate to attract prosperity. * H√∫ngara: very similar to the Frankfurter, but very spicy. * Milanesa: a thin breaded cutlet steak. There is a great variety, such as Milanesa Napolitana, Milanesa Rellena, and Suprema Maryland. * Lehmeyun: an Armenian dish, brought by Armenian immigrants. * Pascualina: a Swiss chard pie, puff pastry crust on bottom and top, filled with seasoned Swiss chard and eggs. Pascualina is a reference to Pascua (Easter) bprought by ligurian immigrants. * Pastel de carne: in English: meat pie. Chopped meat, mashed potatoes, green peppers, olives, and eggs. * Russian salad: potatoes, carrots, peas, and mayonnaise. * Capeletis a la Caruso: Cappeletti with a cream and beef broth based sauce with mushrooms and ham. Pizza (locally pronounced pisa or pitsa), has been wholly included in Uruguayan cuisine, and in its Uruguayan form more closely resembles an Italian calzone than it does its Italian ancestor. Typical Uruguayan pizzas include pizza rellena (stuffed pizza), pizza por metro (pizza by the meter), and pizza a la parrilla (grilled pizza). While Uruguayan pizza derives from Neapolitan cuisine, the Uruguayan fugaza (fugazza) comes from the focaccia xeneise (Genoan), but in any case its preparation is different from its Italian counterpart, and the addition of cheese to make the dish (fugaza con queso or fugazzeta) started in Argentina or Uruguay. Sliced pizza is often served along with fain√°, made with chickpea flour and baked like pizza. For example, it is common for pasta to be eaten with white bread (\\"French bread\\"), which is unusual in Italy. This can be explained by the low cost of bread, and that Uruguayan pasta tends to come together with a large amount of tuco sauce (Italian: suco - juice), and accompanied by estofado (stew). Less commonly, pastas are eaten with a sauce of pesto, a green sauce made with basil, or salsa blanca (B√©chamel sauce). During the 20th century, people in pizzerias in Montevideo commonly ordered a \\"combo\\" of moscato, which is a large glass of a sweet wine called (muscat), plus two stacked pieces (the lower one being pizza and the upper one fain√°). Despite both pizza and faina being Italian in origin, they are never served together in Italy. Polenta comes from Northern Italy and is very common throughout Uruguay. Unlike Italy, this cornmeal is eaten as a main dish, with tuco (meat sauce) and melted cheese and or ham. History The current roots of Uruguayan cuisine can be traced back to a subsistence economy adopted by gauchos, and sustained on subsistence agriculture implanted by the Spanish and Criollos at the start of European colonization. The native peoples did not stay in one place, and Uruguay was used as a remote port, with few incursions for treasure hunting. The only permanent establishment at the time was constituted by Franciscan friars and was located in a territory now belonging to Brazil called Misiones, because their mission there was to Christianize the native peoples. The tradition of mate started during this time, with the monks brewing a beverage with the leaves of yerba mate that the Guarani people used to chew. Cattle was later introduced by Hernando Arias de Saavedra. The first group of immigrants came from poor families from Buenos Aires and the Canary Islands, along with their empanadas and cocidos. Everything was sold from pulperias that were both stores and saloons. The asado tradition came with gauchos that lived in the country, descendants of those first families that having no land nor home, made cattle raiding their way of life. Portuguese and Brazilian influence was also added during Portuguese colonization. Feijoada was incorporated into the rest of the guisos. Food was rudimentary and based on Spanish tradition until immigration at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century when the first families came mostly from Italy and Spain. Immigration increased following World War I and World War II, when people from all over Europe and the Middle East came to Uruguay, including people from Germany, Russia, Italy, and Armenia. Such immigration enriched the importation of dishes, as there is now pasta, Russian salad and innumerable types of pastries from France and Germany, resulting in chaj√° and alfajores. Butter was not widely used until the 1950s, where beforehand the common fat substance came from cattle and not from milk. The introduction of butter resulted in more refined products. Uruguayan cuisine has gone through many changes across the ages and it is still happening today. As for everyday food, Milanesas are being replaced for panchos, croquetas are being replaced for pizza, and guiso de lentejas is becoming more common than puchero or feijoada. Appetizers, entrees and snacks Matambre relleno with Russian salad In Uruguayan cuisine, there is a significant list of preparations and dishes that are included in this category, the most typical or autochthonous is the picada, probably descending from the Spanish tapas, and as for everyday food there are also matambre relleno and lengua a la vinagreta. Aperitif Common spirits produced in Uruguay include grappa and ca√±a; grappa is considered an excellent ap√©ritif, and ca√±a is considered a liqueur. Liquor made with ca√±a has good digestive qualities and is mainly consumed as a drink and not as an aperitif. Ap√©ritifs such as martini, vermouth, whisky, medio y medio (half and half) and also uvita, sangria and wine are popular. Medio y medio is a special blend of dry wine and sparkling wine, or sparkling wine and ca√±a (rum). Uvita is a fortified wine with ca√±a that resembles marsala wine. EntreesPicada= Picada can be described as the main entr√©e of a typical asado (barbecue) and is consumed with aperitifs. It is constituted by cheese (typically Colonia, of Uruguayan origin), olives, longaniza, salami, chips and salted peanuts; peanuts and other snacks are served on small pots and all of the other ingredients are served on a wood table with slices of bread. =Matambre relleno= Matambre relleno is a common dish in Rio de la plata, both in Uruguay as in Argentina. It is one of two dishes prepared from matambre, a meat cut that is a flank steak. It is prepared as luncheon meat by rolling thin slices over spinach, carrots and boiled eggs, tied up and sewn with a strong string, boiled and later pressed and consumed cold. =Lengua a la vinagreta= Lengua a la vinagreta (Spanish for tongue with vinaigrette) is a cold preparation of beef tongue that is previously peeled and boiled and served with a vinagreta sauce made with chopped boiled eggs, parsley, garlic, onions, olive oil, and vinegar. = Pescado en escabeche = Escabeche is a preserved method common in Spain and Spanish-speaking countries. It consists of a mix of oil and vinegar that is used as a marination that also preserves the food. Pescado en escabeche (escabeche fish) is a cold dish often made from Argentine hake that is buttered as in pescado a la marinera. After being separately fried, it is parboiled on a vinaigrette made of oil and vinegar that is added to sliced onions and carrots and whole garlic cloves and black pepper. Side dishes Food is mostly eaten with bread, and sometimes rice, salad or chips. Along with asado, accompaniments are chorizo, morcilla, offal, and also stuffed peppers, and papas al plomo (roasted potatoes). Sauces From asado to pasta, Uruguayan cuisine offers a widely variant of sauces‚Äîmost remarkable are chimichurri, salsa criolla and salsa Carusso. Picantina Picantina is a spicy sauce commonly added to frankfurters (panchos), hungaras, choripanes and hamburgers. It is common to find in fast food dispensers in the street and is locally called 'carritos'. It resembles hot mustard or mayonnaise.  Mojo  Sharing the same name as the Spanish mojo, it is a simple sauce made with garlic, oil, parsley, oregano, paprika, water and salt, and is added to asado during the cooking process and optionally on the dish. Mojo differs from chimichurri in that it has water besides vinegar and less paprika. Chimichurri Chimichurri is between a vinaigrette and a pesto variant, made with chopped garlic, oregano, paprika, oil, vinegar, and salt. Along with salsa criolla it is preferred for asado. Salsa criolla Made with finely chopped tomatoes and onions, oil and salt, salsa criolla is used for garment of asado, choripan and sometimes panchos. Salsa golf Invented in Argentina but also consumed in Uruguay, salsa golf is made from mayonnaise and ketchup. Mostaza La pasiva La Pasiva is a famous chain of restaurants in Uruguay, dedicated to fast food or minutas, as known in the region. Their specialties are panchos and hungaras and they are renowned for their chivito. Moustard La pasiva is a white-colored hot mustard served along with panchos. It is made with beer, starch, mustard grains, pepper, salt and vinegar. Though it has never been sold commercially, small quantities are sometimes given as a gift for clients. Mostaza La pasiva is also used among other mustards as a sauce for puchero meat. Salsa Carusso, estofado and tuco All three are necessary pasta sauces among other foreign pasta sauces. Salsa Carusso was made in honor of the opera singer Enrico Caruso and became a popular sauce (especially for its main dish 'cappeletis a la Carusso'); estofado is a stewed version of ragu made from steaks and sometimes eaten alone; tuco, when it is with chopped meat, resembles a bolognese sauce. Barbecue and salads=Salads Uruguayan cuisine has adopted if not blended a considerable amount of salads, the most typical being the 'Ensalada Criolla'. =Ensalada criolla= With slight variants, it is common for a family of salads that are widespread over the southern south cone region; most variants as in the Chilean salad always include onion and lettuce. The salad common to Uruguay contains tomato along with lettuce and onion and is served with a single vinaigrette made of oil, vinegar, salt, garlic, and oregano. As it is a basic form of salad, it is an ideal accompaniment for asado. =Ensalada rusa= More similar to the polish sa≈Çatka jarzynowa than the typical olivier salad, it contains potatoes, carrots, and peas with mayonnaise. =Ensalada de papa y huevo= This is a potato and egg salad or onion and potato salad or simply potato mayonnaise and parsley. =Ropa vieja= Resembling an old Spanish salpicon, ropa vieja (Spanish for old clothes) intends to include everything that exceeds from asado, mainly the best cuts of meat chopped with vegetables such as potatoes or ensalada criolla. It is not to be confused with the Cuban ropa vieja which is also a derivative dish but resembles more a sancocho than a salad. =Salpicon de ave= Another derivative salpicon, chicken salpicon is made with chicken, eggs, and potatoes. =Palmitos con salsa golf= Simply heart of palm sometimes rolled in ham slices and served with salsa. =Watercress salad= Basically watercress, olive oil and lemon juice. Asado A typical parrilla with chorizos and morcillas Barbecue asado can be said to make the meal or is the meal itself. The meal and cut of meat are also called asado or tira de asado. In most Uruguayan homes, it is common to find a special grill on the patio called an asador. It is a structure made of iron and brick. Most asadores are at least two meters by one meter, have a chimney, a place for firewood and a large grill for the meat. Embers produced by the firewood are placed under the grill. In many towns and cities, street vendors sell asado. These small barbecue grills are called medio tanque (half barrel), because they are made with on adaptation of a split steel drum. Asado cooked this way is sold often on the street as a snack or light lunch. Line cooks grilling sausages and other meats in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay. In the larger cities, such as Montevideo, markets commonly have one or more grill stations where customers can order and eat asado directly at the bar, which may be served with offal, sausages, tapenades, and tapas. It is usually served with lager beer for lunch. The person making the meal is also called asador. Asado is often preceded by ap√©ritives such as vermouth, uvita, and medio y medio, an entree called picada and some chorizos, morcillas, and some offal.  Ingredients  Ingredients of a complete Uruguayan asado include: chorizo, morcilla, pulpon, entra√±a, tira de asado, cow gizzards, chinchulines, chotos, and kidneys. Poultry may also be included. Sometimes, especially on festive days, pork, fish, and lamb are consumed as a substitute for beef, constituting a variant.  Preparation  A parrilla A typical asado takes from one hour to two hours to be prepared, and even more, if a different kind of meat is going to be barbecued (for example a whole pig takes at least four hours to be ready). The asador starts the fire in the burner and, once the fire is started, the meat is salted and condiments added; condiments may include oregano, garlic, paprika, parsley and mojo. The first embers are put in place, the meat put on the grill and embers added to as they fall from the burner. The meat is slowly cooked and smoked on the asador and mojo is added periodically for flavor. The meat is served with bread and salads, condiments such as mojo, chimichurri and Uruguayan salsa criolla and beverages such as wine, clerico and sangria.  Variants - Asado con cuero  Asado con cuero (barbecue with its leather), is a favorite variant rurally and is also appreciated in the capital. It requires a more complex technique than that employed for making asado in that the animal is barbecued whole and even with its hide, though the bones are discarded. This practice was initiated by the pampa people who, if they needed to move on in a hurry, could easily take with them the rolled-up meat.  Beverages  Typical Uruguayan beverages are mate, ca√±a, uvita, grappamiel and medio y medio (half and half).  Grappa  Grappa was brought by Italian immigrants as they kept coming at the immediation of SXIX. Grappamiel and grapa con limon were made in the country from this Italian influence.  Uvita  A taste for wine was acquired from Mediterranean influence, also sangria and clerico. Uvita (little grape) is a fortified wine resembling marsala wine.  Medio y medio  Literally meaning half and half, medio y medio is a drink blend of ca√±a and sparkling wine or dry wine and sparkling wine. It is made and sold under the trademark Roldos.  Mate  A typical Uruguayan mate with tortas fritas Mate is consumed at any time and on any occasion, solely with tortas fritas or biscochos. It is so important that the act of drinking mate is a ritual of friendship between those involved. Even carrying a thermos of hot water facilitates this practice and on hot summer days it is still said to be refreshing. Mate cocido served in a glass Uruguay is the first global consumer of mate, with a consumption of 6.8 kilograms of yerba mate per capita a year, surpassing Argentina by 1.2 kilograms per capita at year. Yerba mate also is consumed as mate cocido. When it is prepared with milk it is called mate de leche and milk is added, it is called mate con leche.  Grapa con limon  Grappa is sold under various trademarks but the most significant one is San Remo. It is distilled and bottled by ANCAP and there was also an attempt to produce the original Italian grappa by some local cellars. When macerated with lemon it is called grapa con limon.  Ca√±a  Ca√±a is an amber-coloured drink distilled similar to aguardiente made from sugar cane mill. Its caramel colour is due to aging in barrels. It is distilled and bottled under the brand name De los 33.  Grapamiel  Ca√±a as much as grappa used to be widely infused with herbs and fruits resulting in traditional combinations such as grappamiel (grappa + honey, honey maceration), grapa con limon (grappa with lemon, lemon maceration), ca√±a con pitanga, ca√±a con butia, and so on. There is a bar in Montevideo called Los yuyos that is famous for serving these varieties.  Stews and puchero  Specially suitable for cold days, Uruguayan guisos or stews are highly revitalizing, especially for their puchero, followed by buseca, guiso carrero, guiso de fideos (noodle stew), estofado and feijoada. Spanish culinary influence is marked in Uruguayan stews, Also there are Italian and Portuguese-Brazilian influences, this last coming from the Luso-Brazilian invasion of Uruguay.  Puchero  From Spanish tradition puchero, Uruguayan puchero differs not much from others of the region, it is like a rough soup where dry ingredients are separated from the broth after cooked to make two separate preparations, a new soup that is first consumed, and later the soup all the other succulent ingredients are consumed with bread. A typical puchero may contain all type of cuts with bones, skirt steak, ossobucco, bacon, cabbage, sweet corn, rape, onions, celery, carrot, sweet potato, squash, and potatoes. All these ingredients cut in big pieces are cooked and served, with the broth are made different soups containing small noodles, rice or any cereal of predilection. It is usual that each commensal makes their puree on his dish with all the cooked vegetables that have been served, aligning it with oil if desired, and also to take off the caracu (bone marrow) from the ossobucco bone and spread it over pieced bread. Mustards of the brand Savora and also La pasiva are used for garnishing puchero meat.  Ensopado  A dish for summer days and popular on rural areas, consisted on broth, noodles and gross slices of meat, chorizo sausage. and tocino bacon boiled together. Its vegetable composition is reduced due is pretended to not ferment on hot days, so it only has few onions and squash. Its name comes from verb ensopar (to moist, to soup), participle ensopado (being souped).  Guiso carrero  Sometimes is hard to say what is Argentinian and what is Uruguayan (history links people hardly), all that sayable is that guiso carrero is part of, not only cuisine, but, Uruguayan folklore, it is a succulent meal consistent of meat, butterbeans, and noodles. Popular fonts can assure that it is a delicious straw containing potato, sweet potato, noodles, squash, onion, tomato, beans, and the best meat. Guiso carrero is served with red wine, bread and grated cheese. When guiso carrero does not contain noodles is called guiso de porotos, and when it does not have beans is called guiso de fideos or ensopado.  Buseca  Buseca from Italian tradition also known as cazuela de mondongo in Spain. Its main ingredient is the mondongo, which is a tripe from the cow's stomach, it is pre-cooked and boiled along with meat, chorizo, peachick, tomato and potato.  Feijoada  A dish originating from Portuguese Brazilian influence that takes a bit from the main Rioplatense culture. Very popular all over Brazil, feijoada also is popular in Uruguay (though not in Argentina). Consumed not only on the northeast but also all along with the country, it is a black bean stew that, unlike the Brazilian feijoada, comes with potatoes (besides bananas and fari√±a), and made with beef more often than pork. It is also common to find chorizo and chorizo Colorado in Uruguayan feijoada.  Bacalao  Bacalao is a dry fish stew made from dried and salted cod, chickpeas, onions, potatoes, tomato sauce, and parsley, it is usually consumed on Uruguay over Easter, as it is a Spanish catholic tradition.  Italian style stews  Also very popular on Uruguayan cuisine, ragu styled stews still are very popular, such as albondigas con papas and estofado. = Ni√±os envueltos = Literally meaning wrapped children, a stew consisting of small wraps the length of a human finger. They are made of loin slices that are filled with bacon, spinach, and carrots, and later boiled in a tomato sauce and served with peas and boiled potatoes. = Estofado = Made from poultry or cow meat, it is called estofado de pollo when made with poultry and estofado de carne when it has cow meat.

Also note that the Spanish distinction between refuerzo and s√°ndwich which is also present in Mexico with torta and s√°ndwich, which differentiates common bread sandwich from others similar to the British train sandwich, is not so pronounced on the Argentinian dialect where difference is simply made by adding de miga (crumby) to the latter. Notable types of refuerzos are chivito, chorip√°n and milanesa al pan.  Chivito  left Chivito meaning literally small goat is a popular type of sandwich originated in Uruguay, its name comes from an unaccomplished desire from a client that literally wanted a beef of small goat or a chivito, being that goat is not consumed in Uruguay client had to be satisfied anyway with this now popular dish.Platted chivito with Russian salad, ensalada criolla and heart of palm.

In 1978, after Adrisi was injured in a suspicious auto accident, troops loyal to him mutinied. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border, eventually leading to the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War.Military rule under Amin, Library of Congress Country Studies: Uganda As the Ugandan war effort collapsed, Adrisi fled to Sudan where he claimed to retain the post of Vice President. He became briefly involved in the rebel activities of the Uganda National Rescue Front before returning from exile in 1987. He struggled with health problems in his later life and died in 2013.  Early life  Mustafa Adrisi was born into the Picara clan of the Aringa ethnic group in Yumbe District, Uganda. He enrolled in the Lodonga Demonstration Primary School in Lodonga. After completing the fourth grade, the Catholic missionaries in charge of the school attempted to convert him from Islam to Christianity and gave him the Christian name Christopher. Adrisi instead dropped out and never completed his education. As a result of this, he was never fully literate. Adrisi practiced polygamy and, over the course of his life, married eight women and fathered multiple children, though by the time of his death he lost seven of his wives to death or divorce.  Military career  In 1951 Adrisi was drafted into the King's African Rifles. He was trained in Nanyuki, Kenya Colony. During his early years of military service, Adrisi acquired property in Keri, Koboko District, Uganda. In 1952 he was promoted to the rank of lance corporal. After additional training and participating in the suppression of the Mau Mau Rebellion in Kenya, he was promoted to corporal. After assuming the rank of sergeant major, he enrolled in the police cadet school in Entebbe, Uganda. While on leave he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. On 1 January 1967 the Ugandan government, in an attempt to instill discipline in the Uganda Army, created the Military Police Force and gave command of the unit to Adrisi and a second lieutenant. After receiving training from the Israelis, he was made captain. Over the next few years he served as second-in command of the Mbarara barracks and the Mbuya army headquarters, and served as a military police instructor. In 1971, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. That year, Colonel Idi Amin launched a coup d'√©tat and became President of Uganda. Adrisi was Amin's uncle. Two years later he was given command of the army brigade based in Mbale. Later that year Adrisi was made army chief of staff as a concession to the increasingly disgruntled Lugbara troops. In 1975 Adrisi was made general and commander of the army. He was later made Minister of Defence. Adrisi also became infamous for his extreme corruption, using his positions to siphon off large amounts of government money for himself. In this way, he earned the nickname \\"Mr. Foreign Exchange\\".  Vice President of Uganda  In January 1977 President Amin removed Adrisi from his post as army chief of staff and appointed him Vice President of Uganda. Amin had ruled Uganda without a vice president for six years, and his decision to give Adrisi the job probably stemmed from his wish to appease soldiers who wanted the dismissal of Brigadier Hussein Marella, an ally of Amin who had killed a prominent Lugbara officer. Adrisi was instructed to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, but declined to do so. That year a split in the Uganda Army developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to Adrisi, who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners, particularly Sudanese, from the military. Adrisi felt that foreigners were not dependent enough on the regime to support it, and would at their convenience flee back to their lands of origin. He thought that it would be best if the Uganda Army was made up of northern Ugandans who had a larger stake in fighting for it. The resulting tension in the army was further exacerbated when Adrisi got in a shootout with Colonel Flassan Taban, the head of the marines. Despite threatening civilians earlier in his career, Adrisi was increasingly viewed by segments of the army and general populace as a proponent of a return to law and order, as he had freed several civilian detainees and publicly condemned extra-judicial killings. He later testified that Amin had summoned him four times to accuse him of plotting a coup, which he repeatedly denied. According to journalist George Ivan Smith, Adrisi was also involved in a purge of Langi and Acholi in 1977, during which a large number of civilians were murdered in northern Uganda. By the end of the year he also held the post of Minister of Internal Affairs. On the morning of 19 April 1978 while traveling to a police station in Jinja, Adris's car was involved in an accident in Mbalala. A stationed wagon collided with his vehicle from the front, and then his escort vehicle rear-ended his vehicle. A shootout between Adrisi's bodyguards and the security personnel in the other vehicle ensued, and several people were killed. Adrisi was then flown to Cairo for treatment of head injuries and multiple fractures in his leg. While he was there, Amin declared on 8 May that he was stripping him of his positions as Minister of Defence and Minister of Internal Affairs and denounced him for retiring senior prison officials without his knowledge. Amin also demoted or dismissed numerous government officials, most of whom had been supportive of Adrisi. Unrest grew in the military as a result of the incident, since many of Adrisi's followers believed that the car accident was a failed assassination attempt orchestrated by Amin. Adrisi himself never accused Amin of being behind the accident. After about a month Adrisi returned to Uganda and re- assumed his post as vice president. Advised that he should take time to recuperate, he retired to his home in Keri. In 1979 Tanzanian forces and the Uganda National Liberation Front invaded Uganda and occupied the country. When they entered the town of Koboko, the seat of the eponymous district, Adrisi fled to Kaya, Sudan with over 2,000 cattle. His three-house home was consequently destroyed with dynamite by the Tanzanian-led forces. He, his family, and their entourage initially found refuge in Yei. The Sudanese government later moved him to the village of Lutaya, where many former officials of Amin's regime were housed. While in exile in Sudan, Adrisi still claimed to be Vice President of Uganda.  Later life  In 1980 Adrisi, Moses Ali, and several other military officers of Amin's extant regime formed the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF), a rebel group to retake control of Uganda. The following year Ali began attacking Uganda, and the government requested that Sudanese authorities halt Adrisi's and his colleagues' activities. The Sudanese government subsequently arrested them and took them to Juba for questioning. They were released three weeks later. Following Yoweri Museveni's assumption of the Ugandan Presidency, Adrisi requested that he be repatriated to Uganda. He was scheduled to return in January 1987, but threats posed by members of the UNRF who wanted to continue the insurgency delayed his return until April. Adrisi arrived in Uganda impoverished, and was given a government-owned house in Arua District. The Ugandan government later established a commission to investigate human rights abuses committed during Amin's regime. Adrisi testified against his former colleagues. The commission did not find any conclusive evidence that Adrisi was involved in any atrocities during his service in the regime. After falling ill in 2008, the Ugandan government flew Adrisi to Mulago Hospital in Kampala. He briefly fell into a coma, but after recovering and being discharged, the government permanently located him to another house in Kampala so it could monitor his health. He died at Mulago Hospital on 28 July 2013 due to complications from a broken leg, diabetes, and hypertension. He was buried in a state funeral in Keri on 1 August.

Traditional Far Eastern cast coins‚Äîso-called 'cash coins'‚Äîare the most famous example of cast coinage, and were issued from the 4th century BC until circa 1912, predominantly in bronze, brass or iron.

Cast potins circulated in Kent from around 100 BC to around 50 BC. At a point during the first century of the Christian era, cast bronze coins were produced in Dorset with archaeological evidence pointing towards Hengistbury Head as the source. By AD 200, cast copies of silver denarii were being produced in a number of areas of Britain.

Some of the earliest evidence of human art suggests that people told stories with pictures. Although there are some common features to all narrative art, different cultures have developed idiosyncratic ways to discern narrative action from pictures. Prior to the advent of literacy most narrative art was done in a simultaneous narrative style with very little overarching organization. Once literacy developed in different parts of the world pictures began to be organized along register lines, like lines on a page, that helped define the direction of the narrative. This method of linking scenes together led to other ways of telling stories in the 20th century, namely the newspaper, comic strips and comic books. In painting in traditional Western art since the Renaissance, the concept of history painting covers most narrative scenes.  History  Though it requires sophisticated conventions to make the narrative clear, narrative art occurs very early in the history of art. A number of reliefs in the European Bronze Age Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin show monoscenic narratives of hunting or battle, the former sometimes indicating the movements of hunter or prey with indications of their tracks in a way similar to modern diagrammatic illustrations. One of the earliest works of Ancient Egyptian art is the Narmer Palette relief in the Louvre Museum, which shows a victory of King Narmer (c. 31st century BC) in several scenes. Narrative art was employed extensively in the Neo-Assyrian Period. Most significantly, the walls of the major Assyrian royal palaces (the Northwest Palace of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud,Budge, E.A.W. 1914.

Sometimes, scenes were also depicted on glazed bricks or wall paintings (e.g. at Til Barsip). Bronze bands decorating the doors of Assyrian temples and palaces were also sometimes decorated with scenes of the king's activities in narrative style. The most famous of these are the \\"Balawat Gates\\" commissioned by Shalmaneser III for his palace at Balawat (ancient Imgur-Enlil);King, L.W. 1915.

The lives of Jesus and Buddha, the founders of new religions, their followers, and in the case of Buddha also the former lives, were to provide new subject- matter for narrative art, as did elements of older religions such as the Labours of Hercules. Trajan's Column is an exceptional example of Imperial Roman narrative art. In Christian art the Life of Christ in art and Life of the Virgin supplied the most common subjects, based around the incidents celebrated in the major feasts of the church calendar, but the lives of saints gave many others. Book illustrations are found from ancient times in several cultures, and are very often narrative in nature. There appear to have been some lavishly illustrated books in Western Late Antiquity, no doubt belonging to wealthy collectors, including both classic literary texts (Vergilius Vaticanus and Vergilius Romanus) and biblical texts; the Quedlinburg Itala fragment seems to have had between two and four images facing every text page, and to have been more densely illustrated than any subsequent biblical text in an illuminated manuscript.  Types  16th-century Italian cycle of the Life of Christ in art in fresco with 21 scenes from Annunciation to Resurrection: Top row: Annunciation, Nativity, Visit of the Three Magi, Flight to Egypt, Baptism of Christ, Raising of Lazarus, Entry to Jerusalem, Last Supper.

Bottom row: Ecce homo, Carrying the cross, Christ falls, Crucifixion, Deposition from the cross, Harrowing of Hell, Resurrection. Narratives occur in a space and unfold in time. In narrative art, the artist chooses how to portray the story, represent the space, and how to shape time within the artwork.Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 375 Narrative art can be categorized into various types, also known as modes or styles. A piece of artwork is not limited to only one type of narrative. An artwork may have a narrative type as a whole, as well as portions of the artwork itself that depict separate types of narratives. Several of these types are covered below. A depicted action in itself can suggest a scene or setting: > You can imagine the Trojan War taking place at Troy without having to depict > the actual city of Troy. You can show Achilles dragging Hector‚Äôs body around > the city of Troy without having to depict the walls of the city. > Nonetheless, the idea that each action is limited to a specific place can > still pertain, because the Trojan War did take place at Troy and Achilles > did drag Hector‚Äôs body around the city.Jocelyn Penny Small 1999, p. 571  Simultaneous narrative  A simultaneous narrative is a type of narrative that has very little visually discernible organization to those who are not acquainted with its purpose. It can focus on geometric or abstract designs as well as the placement or arrangement of items within the artwork. Simultaneous narratives concentrate on repeatable patterns and redundant systems with a focus on dualities.Petersen, 2010  Monoscenic narrative  A monoscenic narrative is a type of narrative that represents a single scene. There is no repetition of characters and there is only one action taking place. The scene is one that is easily identifiable in context of the narrative and is of significant importance. Under this definition, most art that is usually not considered a narrative would fit under the monoscenic narrative type. Narrative art is art that tells a story, either as a moment in an ongoing story or as a sequence of events unfolding over time. This in retrospect makes a good portion of art narrative art. Landscapes and portraits however do not meet the criteria of the definition provided, though they might be, depending on the artist‚Äôs intention. Achilles kills Penthesilea (amphora) by Exekias Exekias was an ancient Greek vase-painter and potter. A good portion of his vase work included scenes from Greek mythology. He was known for his ability to capture the most critical points of a story and illustrate them into one simple scene. The amphora portraying Achilles killing Penthesilea is such an example. This monoscenic narrative illustrated on this amphora exemplifies a vital part of the Trojan saga. It is the moment in which Achilles and Penthesilea fall in love. In the heat of battle, Achilles battles Penthesilea and with a fatal blow, causes her helmet to be pushed back. When their eyes meet, it is said that they fall in love. This is ruined by Achilles‚Äô inability to control his bloodlust. Due to this tragedy, Achilles refuses to fight and from this many consequences arise that eventually could be linked to his demise. British art tradition A line of development of narrative art begins with William Hogarth, the English painter. His monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in a narrative were taken up in the 19th century by other British painters. The Victorian terms applied to this style were \\"subject painting\\" or \\"anecdotic\\" painting.  Continuous narrative  Trajan's Column is an example of a continuous narrative A continuous narrative is a type of narrative that illustrates multiple scenes of a narrative within a single frame. Multiple actions and scenes are portrayed in a single visual field without any dividers. The sequence of events within the narrative is defined through the reuse of the main character or characters. It emphasizes the change in movement and state of the repeating characters as indicators of scene or phase changes in the narrative.Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386  Column of Trajan  The Column of Trajan depicts one event: the Dacian Wars. This continuous narrative can be broken down into a series of events. These events flow from one scene to another without any physical indicators such as vertical lines. Because of how the narrative is read, from standing in front of the column, it seems to ebb right to left and then left to right which is common in continuous narratives.Jocelyn Penny Small 1999, p. 571 The narrative becomes rather hard to read as the column gets higher. Research suggests that the column was originally planned to be read while walking a circular staircase around the column itself .Jocelyn Penny Small 1999, p. 571 The story then would not ebb and continue on in a sequential manner.  Bayeux Tapestry  Section of the Bayeux Tapestry The 'Bayeux Tapestry' (a misnomer as it is really an embroidery not a tapestry) tells the story of the Norman invasion of England in 1066. The theme of the Bayeux Tapestry is treason and deception.Dodwell 1966, p. 554 The narrative reflects a partisan Norman view of the events of the conquest of England. Though the tapestry seems to be framed because it is separated by registers, horizontal lines, it is still a continuous narrative. Registers are needed in order to separate a story to fit within a certain area. If cut up and placed next to each other, a continuous narrative would exist. A continuous narrative does not have any separation between scenes and actions.  Synoptic narrative  A synoptic narrative depicts a single scene in which a character or characters are portrayed multiple times within a frame to convey that multiple actions are taking place. This causes the sequence of events to be unclear within the narrative. Synoptic narratives typically provide visual cues that convey the sequence, but still might be difficult to decipher for those unfamiliar with the story.Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 382  Chaddanta Jataja, Amaravati  An instance of a synoptic narrative is one represented in a medallion from the stupa at Amaravati.Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383 It, like many synoptic narratives, can be difficult to interpret. The medallion is meant to present the reader with the story of Buddha‚Äôs previous birth as the elephant Chaddanta. The center of the medallion has only decorative carving, which is a visual cue on how the medallion is meant to be interpreted; which is in a circular pattern. Other than that subtle visual cue the artist leaves very little indication of the order. Illustrates how the medallion is meant to be read. The medallion can be separated into 3 episodes: * 1 - Chaddanta presents his chief queen with lotus. * 2 - Junior queen in offended. * 3 ‚Äì She, the junior queen, leaves to be on her own. * 4 ‚Äì She lays dying, hoping for revenge. * 5 ‚Äì A hunter aims an arrow at Chaddanta. * 6 ‚Äì The hunter saws off Chaddanta‚Äôs tusks. * 7- The hunter is seen departing with the tusks. (This isn‚Äôt numbered but is at the very top center)Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 383  Panoramic narrative  Detail of the north frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi A panoramic (or panoptic) narrative is a narrative that depicts multiple scenes and actions without the repetition of characters. Actions may be in a sequence or represent simultaneous actions during an event.  Siphnian Treasury North Frieze  The Siphnian Treasury at Delphi has four marble friezes, one for each cardinal direction. These four friezes depict panoramic narratives through the use of carvings of the marble. The north frieze is an illustration of a battle between the Olympic gods and the giants. In the far left two giants attack Zeus in his chariot, who is no longer visible due to deterioration. Hera is seen finishing off a giant to the right of Zeus with Athena behind her (further right) fighting two giants. To the right of Athena is her brother Ares who is fighting two other giants with one already dead at his feet. There are multiple narratives taking place with each combatant in varying scenes. The dead giant at Ares' feet was downed by Athena but Ares is depicted as moving forward in the narrative by stepping over the corpse.Petrakos 1977, p. 47  Progressive narrative  A page by Rodolphe T√∂pffer A progressive narrative portrays a single scene in which characters do not repeat. However, multiple actions are taking place in order to convey a passing of time in the narrative. A progressive narrative is not to be interpreted as a group of simultaneous events but rather a sequence that is dependent on its location.Jocelyn Penny Small 1999, p. 571 Actions displayed by characters in the narratives compact present and future action into a single image.  Sequential narrative  A sequential narrative is very much like a continuous narrative with one major difference. A sequential narrative focuses on enframement to develop temporal progression.Vidya Dehejia 1990, p. 386 Each scene and action is represented within its frame as a unit. Each frame is a particular scene during a particular moment. A sequential narrative is the type of narrative generally used in comics.

WDTK is the Detroit outlet for such syndicated conservative talkers as Sean Hannity, Mike Gallagher, Dennis Prager, Hugh Hewitt, Larry Elder and Michael Medved as well as local talkers such as John McCulloch. History The station began in November 1925 at 1170 kHz as WMBC. The calls stood for the station's original owners, the Michigan Broadcast Company. WMBC's frequency changed to 1230 in 1927 and to 1420 in 1930. WMBC was an early outlet for religious programming and gospel music in Detroit, but was probably most famous as the home of conservative radio commentator Jerry Buckley, who was shot dead in the lobby of the LaSalle Hotel in 1930 after successfully campaigning for a mayoral recall election in which then-mayor Charles Bowles lost. WMBC's call letters were changed to WJLB in 1939 after the station was acquired by John Lord Booth (who renamed the station for himself), and in 1941 the station settled on its current home of 1400 kHz. Being a small independent station, WJLB relied on brokered programming to pay the bills, much of which was ethnic in nature, including many programs targeted toward Detroit's African-American community. One of WJLB's most popular programs during its early years was the Interracial Goodwill Hour, a jazz and R&B; show hosted by later Cleveland radio legend Bill Randle. By the 1960s, WJLB had competition for Detroit's black audience in the form of 1440 AM WCHB and later 107.5 FM WGPR, and WJLB evolved into a chiefly R&B;/soul music station, using the slogan \\"Tiger Radio\\" for a time in the late 1960s. Perhaps WJLB's most well-known personality in the 1960s and 1970s was Martha Jean \\"The Queen\\" Steinberg, one of the first successful female air personalities in Detroit, best known for her trademark line, \\"I betcha!\\" On the evening of July 23, 1967 Steinberg got the station to cancel its regular programing and let her do a broadcast encouraging people to stop rioting.Sidney Fine, Violence in the Model City: The Cavanagh Administration, Race Reliations, and the Detroit Riot of 1967 (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1989), p. 184 In the early 1970s, Steinberg led the WJLB air staff in protesting the fact that the station employed no African-Americans outside of the air personalities. In 1980, in response to the growing popularity of FM radio, WJLB-AM 1400 switched call signs and formats with its ethnic sister station, WMZK-FM 97.9. WJLB-FM was updated to the then-new urban contemporary format and has been a top-rated station in Detroit since. However, WJLB-FM dropped Steinberg's show, and Martha Jean the Queen found herself without a radio home until 1982, when a Steinberg-led group called TXZ Corporation purchased WMZK-AM 1400 and changed the calls to WQBH (the calls stood for Queen Broadcasts Here). WQBH took on a full-service format of R&B; and gospel music and African-American-oriented talk which would continue for over two decades. With backing from Michigan National Bank, Steinberg took full ownership of WQBH (as \\"Queen's Broadcasting Corporation\\") in 1997. After Steinberg's death in January 2000, ownership of the station reverted to a consortium of her three daughters and the Order of the Fisherman Ministry. WQBH continued to air broadcasts of Steinberg's past programs after her death. In March 2004, Salem Communications announced that it would be acquiring WQBH from the Steinberg family for $4.75 million. The sale was finalized in May, and in September, Salem changed WQBH's calls to WDTK and installed the current conservative news/talk format. In late July 2012, WDTK's FM translator, W224CC on 92.7 FM signed on at 99 watts of power. In the Fall of 2014 the Patriot began covering the Detroit Catholic High School League Game of the Week. Jeremy Otto and Sean Baligian call the action. In 2015 the station added a drive home show hosted by Brendan Johnson. On November 18, 2016, WDTK moved its FM repeater operations from 92.7 FM to a new translator in Oak Park, W268CN, on 101.5. The former repeater on 92.7 remains on the air, but was repurposed as a repeater for sister station WLQV. While not protected this far out, the new repeater on 101.5 has drowned out Toledo, Ohio's WRVF (also on 101.5) in much of Downtown Detroit and the Metro Detroit area north of Eureka Road.

Retrieved 21 June 2007. Nigo cites his early influences as Elvis, The Beatles and hip-hop acts such as Beastie Boys and Run‚ÄìD.M.C. After studying fashion editing at college, he worked as an editor and a stylist for Popeye magazine. After borrowing four million yen from an acquaintance, who also let him use his shop, he opened \\"Nowhere\\", his first store, along with Jun Takahashi of Undercover, on April 1, 1993, in Ura-Harajuku. Deciding to start his own brand, he named it after the 1968 film Planet of the Apes. According to Nigo, the name \\"BAPE\\" is a reference to \\"A Bathing Ape in Lukewarm Water\\". Japanese people typically have daily baths in water at temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 ¬∞F). As such, to bathe in lukewarm water is to complacently overindulge as it implies you have stayed in the bath for so long the water has become cold. This is an ironic reference to the lazy opulence of the younger generation of Japanese, the brand's own customers. To expose the brand he gave T-shirts to the musician Cornelius who wore them when performing. For two years he produced 30 to 50 shirts a week, selling half and giving half to friends. In 1997, Nigo released his debut album Ape Sounds under Mo'Wax, with DJ/Producer James Lavelle of UNKLE. Nigo is also co-owner and head designer of Pharrell Williams' clothes brands Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream. On February 1, 2011, it was announced that A Bathing Ape had been sold to Hong Kong fashion conglomerate I.T Group. I.T purchased a 90.27% stake in A Bathing Ape. In a transaction encompassing HK$21,850,000 (approx. US$2.8 million), I.T purchased a total of 668 shares. Exact details regarding the creative future and expansion of A Bathing Ape are unknown; however, A Bathing Ape founder Nigo remained on board as the Creative Director for the next two years.

Gertrude Barrows Bennett (September 18, 1884February 2, 1948), known by the pseudonym Francis Stevens, was a pioneering author of fantasy and science fiction.Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965 by Eric Leif Davin, Lexington Books, 2005, pages 409-10. Bennett wrote a number of fantasies between 1917 and 1923. and has been called \\"the woman who invented dark fantasy\\".\\"The Woman Who Invented Dark Fantasy\\" by Gary C. Hoppenstand from Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, page x. Her most famous books include Claimed (which Augustus T. Swift, in a letter to The Argosy called \\"One of the strangest and most compelling science fantasy novels you will ever read\\") and the lost world novel The Citadel of Fear. Bennett also wrote an early dystopian novel, The Heads of Cerberus (1919).The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, Cambridge University Press, 2003, page 30.  Life  Gertrude Mabel Barrows was born in Minneapolis in 1884, to Charles and Caroline Barrows (n√©e Hatch). Her father, a Civil War veteran from Illinois, died in 1892.U.S., Burial Registers, Military Posts and National Cemeteries, 1862‚Äì1960 Gertrude completed school through the eighth grade, then attended night school in hopes of becoming an illustrator (a goal she never achieved). Instead, she began working as a stenographer, a job she held on and off for the rest of her life.\\"The Woman Who Invented Dark Fantasy\\" by Gary C. Hoppenstand from Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, p. xvi. In 1909 Barrows married Stewart Bennett, a British journalist and explorer, and moved to Philadelphia. A year later her husband died during a tropical storm while on a treasure hunting expedition.The Influential Pulp Career of Francis Stevens With a new-born daughter to raise, Bennett continued working as a stenographer. When her father died toward the end of World War I, Bennett assumed care for her invalid mother. Virtually all of Bennett's work dates from 1917 to 1920, when she began to write short stories and novels to support the household. She stopped writing when her mother died in 1920; one later work published in 1923 appears to have been written during the late 'teens, and submitted to Weird Tales when that magazine was just starting up. In the mid-1920s, Bennett placed her daughter in the care of friends and moved to California. Because she was estranged from her daughter, for a number of years researchers believed Bennett died in 1939 ‚Äì a 1939 letter from her daughter was returned as undeliverable, and her daughter did not hear from Bennett after this date. However, new research, including her death certificate, shows that she died in 1948.  Writing career  Gertrude Mabel Barrows (as she then was) wrote her first short story at age 17, a science fiction story titled \\"The Curious Experience of Thomas Dunbar\\". She mailed the story to Argosy, then one of the top pulp magazines. The story was accepted and published in the March 1904 issue, under the byline \\"G. M. Barrows\\". Although the initials disguised her gender, this appears to be the first instance of an American female author publishing science fiction, and using her real name. That same month, Youth's Companion published her poetry. Once Bennett began to take care of her mother, she decided to return to fiction writing as a means of supporting her family. The first story she completed after her return to writing was the novella \\"The Nightmare\\", which appeared in All-Story Weekly in 1917. The story is set on an island separated from the rest of the world, on which evolution has taken a different course. \\"The Nightmare\\" resembles Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot, itself published a year later. While Bennett had submitted \\"The Nightmare\\" under her own name, she had asked to use a pseudonym if it was published. The magazine's editor chose not to use the pseudonym Bennett suggested (Jean Vail) and instead credited the story to Francis Stevens. When readers responded positively to the story, Bennett chose to continue writing under the name. Over the next few years, Bennett wrote a number of short stories and novellas. Her short story \\"Friend Island\\" (All-Story Weekly, 1918), for example, is set in a 22nd-century ruled by women. Another story is the novella \\"Serapion\\" (Argosy, 1920), about a man possessed by a supernatural creature. This story has been released in an electronic book entitled Possessed: A Tale of the Demon Serapion, with three other stories by her. Many of her short stories have been collected in The Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy (University of Nebraska Press, 2004).Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, In 1918 she published her first, and perhaps best,\\"The Woman Who Invented Dark Fantasy\\" by Gary C. Hoppenstand from Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, pp. xiii‚Äìxiv. novel The Citadel of Fear (Argosy, 1918). This lost world story focuses on a forgotten Aztec city, which is \\"rediscovered\\" during World War I.Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature by Frank Northen Magill, Salem Press, 1983, p. 287.\\"The Woman Who Invented Dark Fantasy\\" by Gary C. Hoppenstand from Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy by Francis Stevens, University of Nebraska Press, 2004, p. xiv. It was the introduction to a 1952 reprint edition of the novel which revealed that \\"Francis Stevens\\" was Bennett's pen-name. A year later she published her only science fiction novel, The Heads of Cerberus (The Thrill Book, 1919). One of the first dystopian novels, the book features a \\"grey dust from a silver phial\\" which transports anyone who inhales it to a totalitarian Philadelphia of 2118 AD. One of Bennett's most famous novels was Claimed! (Argosy, 1920; reprinted 1966, 2004, 2018), in which a supernatural artifact summons an ancient and powerful god to early 20th century New Jersey. Augustus T. Swift called the novel \\"One of the strangest and most compelling science fantasy novels you will ever read\\". Apparently The Thrill Book had accepted more of her stories when it was cancelled in October 1919, only seven months after the first issue. These were never published and became lost. It has been hypothesized that \\"Sunfire\\", which appeared in Weird Tales in 1923, was one of these stories that had originally been accepted by Thrill Book; it was the only 'new' story published by Bennett after 1920, although it was almost certainly written in 1919 or earlier.  Influence  Bennett has been credited as having \\"the best claim at creating the new genre of dark fantasy\\". It has been said that Bennett's writings influenced both H. P. Lovecraft and A. Merritt, both of whom \\"emulated Bennett's earlier style and themes\\". Lovecraft was even said to have praised Bennett's work. However, there is controversy about whether or not this actually happened and the praise appears to have resulted from letters wrongly attributed to Lovecraft.Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy edited by Robin Anne Reid, Greenwood, 2008, page 289.An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia edited by S. T. Joshi, David E. Schultz, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001, page 218. As for Merritt, for several decades critics and readers believed \\"Francis Stevens\\" was a pseudonym of his. This rumor only ended with the 1952 reprinting of Citadel of Fear, which featured a biographical introduction of Bennett by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach.\\"Introduction to Citadel of Fear\\" by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach, Citadel of Fear by Francis Stevens, Polaris Press, 1952. Critic Sam Moskowitz said she was the \\"greatest woman writer of science fiction in the period between Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and C.L. Moore\\". Because Bennett was the first American woman to have her fantasy and science fiction widely published, she qualifies as a pioneering female fantasy author.

The band was originally formed as Casino in 2003 and changed its name to SpiderSimpson after signing to Polydor in 2006, before reverting to the original name in late 2008 to release its first album The Spider Simpson Incident. The band has a strong and loyal cult following in its home city of Birmingham, England. The band was inactive after the departure of Deavall, who has formed a new band (The High Hurts), and with Zindani being more involved with the Stereophonics with little time left to work with Casino. Currently the band are back in business, they've signed a record deal and recently released an album on Spotify.  Casino (2003‚Äì2006)  The band played its first home gig at The Railway music bar in Birmingham in September 2003. Soon after, they were approached to submit five songs for a film company - which later became the basis of the soundtrack for the Ultimate Pictures film, Global Heresy, starring Alicia Silverstone and Martin Clunes, ironically depicting the trials and tribulations of an up-and-coming rock'n'roll band. Over the next year, the band went on to build a loyal fan base from the roots up by gigging extensively around the U.K, including support slots with the Stereophonics, which culminated in being invited to open the Stereophonics 2005 UK tour. During 2005, a self-produced demo caught the attention of the newly formed Midlands-based rock radio station, Kerrang, which decided to playlist the band's song \\"Lose Myself\\" during prime time listening hours. The subsequent increase in popularity saw the band continuing to play small local venues and supporting The Suffrajets on their UK tour. \\"Lose Myself\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Machine\\" were both used for the Gumball 2006 TV show.  SpiderSimpson (2006‚Äì2008)  The band signed to Polydor in spring 2006 and changed the name to SpiderSimpson, after a character from a cult film. They recorded what was then going to be their first album at studio 606 in Los Angeles with the producer Nick Raskulinecz. The band has had constant support from Kerrang Radio, local and national fans and has also had radio support from both Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters and Kelly Jones of Stereophonics. The band were not happy with the original track order of the album and had the recording rejected by Polydor. In autumn 2006, Casino completed the Kerrang Radio Breakthrough Tour with other newly signed bands, followed by a UK tour in December. In 2007, Zindani became heavily involved with touring with Stereophonics as their live guitarist. In 2008, the future of the band was put in doubt when Deavall began playing keyboards and providing backing vocals live for the Welsh rockers Feeder, and Zindani was made a permanent member of Stereophonics.  Casino return (2008‚Äìpresent)  In December 2008, there were reports online that \\"Spider Simpson are Dying\\". However, it was later announced that the band was dropping the SpiderSimpson name and returning to Casino, and that an album had been recorded the previous year. This was a re- recording of the album rejected by Polydor, their management company having bought back the rights to the music. The album was re-recorded on a shoestring budget with the Stereophonics producer Jim Lowe mixing. It was sold at Stereophonics shows but is currently not available anymore. Entitled The Spider Simpson Incident, the album has some old tracks including those on the original track list and some new. The album was boosted in early 2009, with Kerrang radio playing several songs as well as sold-out shows in Worcester and Birmingham. In the last quarter of 2009, Deavall, after playing a few one-off shows with Casino, formed the rock band The High Hurts in the role of lead singer and spent most of 2009 recording with them. Deavall left Casino to concentrate on The High Hurts while Zindani has been frequently touring with Stereophonics: as a result, there has seen very little activity with Casino. It has been said that the band still want to continue. 2011 In March, Zindani revealed on the band's Facebook page that the band was rehearsing three times a week and had also written new songs. In May Zindani revealed on Kerrang! Radio that the band signed a record deal, they were going to play at Artsfest Birmingham in September and there would be a single out in September. Due to delays the single will be out by the end of 2012, just before the album release. At the beginning of September it was announced Neil would no longer be playing Bass for Casino, standing in for him is Jimi Crutchley, his first show with the band was 9 September at a warm-up gig, prior to their Artsfest performance, at Marr's Bar in Worcester. Jimi is also known as Bassist for Raven Vandelle, a band also from Birmingham. Later that month the band appeared in Rock Sound Presents the Sitcom Soldiers Sessions, In Association With Longwave. In the video the band performs their single 'Fallen'. Also an acoustic version of 'Fallen' was filmed. Since then the band has done several gigs in Birmingham, London and Worcester. 2012‚Äì2013 On 11 November 2012 the band released their debut single 'Runaway / Rise and Fall' available on iTunes. The band was working on a new album, Zindani revealed it is going to be named 'Heavy Fever'. It was released on Spotify shortly after the release of Runaway/Rise and Fall.

Since September, 1996, the crew of STB broadcast news (under title \\"Vikna\\" (eng.- \\"Windows\\")) on the frequency of UT-2. In 1999, STB fell under the influence of companies of the Russian Lukoil Group through its Norcross Corporation because of pro Russia pro Kremlin pro Putin Leonid Kuchma's support for aggressive actions taken against STB management's independent position in early 1999 resulting in Oleksiy Fedun, who made STB into a very pro Kuchma platform, becoming the executive president of the network on September 6, 1999. In 2000 the popularity of the channel rose. The most popular programs are Vikna. News., Vikna. Business., Vikna. Capital-city., Vikna. Crimes., Vikna. Sport. and Vikna. Midnight.

The name Cape ground squirrel is somewhat misleading as it actually has a much wider area of habitation. This common name may have been arrived at to distinguish it from a tree squirrel (the eastern grey squirrel) found around Cape Town, which was imported from Europe by Cecil John Rhodes. Description The Cape ground squirrel has black skin with a coat made of short stiff hairs without underfur. The fur is cinnamon on the back while the face, underbelly, sides of neck and ventral sides of limbs are white.Skurski, D., J. Waterman. 2005. \\"Xerus inauris\\", Mammalian Species 781:1-4. The sides of its body each have a white stripe that stretches from the shoulders to the thighs. The eyes are fairly large and have white lines around them. The pinnae are small. The tail is flattened on the back and underside and is covered with white hair and two black bands at the base.Skinner J. D., R. H. N. Smithers. 1990.

The glans penis of the males are large with a prominent baculum. This species is notable for its impressively large testicles, which are roughly golf ball size, around 20% of the length of the head and body. Moulting occurs between August and September and between March and April, once per year. Distribution The Cape ground squirrel is widespread in southern Africa; through Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, and Namibia.Herzig-Straschil B. 1979. \\"Xerus inauris (Rodentia, sciuridae)-an inhabitant of arid regions of southern Africa\\", Folia Zoologica 28:119-124. Its range covers most of Namibia but is absent from coastal regions and the northwest. Ground squirrels inhabit central and southwestern Kalahari in Botswana.Smithers R. H. N. 1971. The mammals of Botswana, Salisbury, Rhodesia, Museum Memoirs No. 4. In South Africa, it can be found in central and north-central areas. Behaviour and ecology Cape ground squirrels live mainly in arid or semiarid areas. They prefer to live in veld and grasslands with hard ground. They can also be found in scrub along pans, on floodplains and in agricultural areas. Ground squirrel are generally active during the day and do not hibernate. They are burrowing animals that dig and live in clusters of burrows averaging around Waterman, J. M. 1995. \\"The social organization of the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris; Rodentia: Sciuridae)\\". Ethology 101:130‚Äì147. with 2-100 entrances. Burrow serve to protect the squirrel from extreme temperatures at the surface as well as predators. Nevertheless, most of the day is spent feeding at the surface. For thermoregulation, ground squirrels shade their head and back with their bushy tails.Bennett, A. F., R. B. Huey, H. John-Alder, and K. E. Nagy. 1984. \\"The parasol tail and thermoregulatory behavior of the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris)\\", Physiological Zoology 57:57‚Äì62. Dust bathing is also done. Ground squirrels eat bulbs, fruits, grasses, herbs, insects and shrubs. They forage daily and do not hoard food,. The Cape ground squirrel usually does not need to drink as it gets sufficient moisture from its food. A ground squirrel's daily activities are made of around 70% feeding, 15-20% being vigilant and around 10% socializing. The squirrels use the position of the sun as an orientation marker to hide and recover their food. The burrows of Cape ground squirrels are also used by meerkats and yellow mongooses.Waterman, J., J. Roth. 2007. \\"Interspecific associations of Cape ground squirrels with two mongoose species: benefit or cost?\\". Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 61(11):1675-1683. While Cape ground squirrels and meerkats appear to have a mutual relationship, mongoose and squirrel relations appear to be more commensal. Predators of ground squirrels include jackals, snakes and monitor lizards. Ground squirrels may be able to scent the differences in the dropping of predators and non-predators.Belton, L., N. Ball, J. Waterman, P. Bateman. 2007. \\"Do Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) discriminate between olfactory cues in the faeces of predators versus non-predators?\\", African Zoology, 42(1): 135-138. When threatened by predators ground squirrels engage in mobbing behaviour:Waterman, J. M. 1997. \\"Why do male Cape ground squirrels live in groups?\\" Animal Behaviour 53:809‚Äì817. several squirrels rush at the predator while using their bushy tails to block it. When the predator strikes back, all the squirrels back off. However, multiple mobbings are usually successful in driving away predators. Social behaviour Cape ground squirrels live in groups of two to three adult females and a maximum of nine sub-adults of either sex Cape ground squirrels live in groups of two to three adult females and a maximum of nine sub-adults of either sex as well as the females‚Äô dependent offspring. Groups that have more than three females split into smaller groups. Adult males live separately from females and only join when the females are in estrus. Male groups number up to 19 unrelated individuals, which are not agonistic. Within a male group, four to five males may form temporary subgroups that change size and members each day. Female groups live in separate burrow clusters. A female group's home range is c. with core areas of around . Home ranges can overlap. Core areas are defended by agonistic behaviour. Male groups live in home ranges envelop those of several female groups and average . Within a female group there is no dominance hierarchy, and members use the same feeding and sleeping ranges. Male groups, by contrast, live in ages-based linear hierarchies. Competition between males usually takes the form of leaping displays that cause no injuries. Unlike female groups, male groups are not territorial, and membership is very open. During oestrus, a female will be approached, solicited and chased by males trying to mate with her. The most dominant males get the first matings. A female will mate with the same male several times. If a male has not yet mated with a female, he will disrupt the copulations she has with other males. However, mate guarding is rare. Communication When perceiving something as a threat, ground squirrels will emit a whistle-like call as an alarm call. The alarm call comes in two forms; the short and shrill \\"bi-jo\\" which signals serious danger, and a medium-pitched \\"bi-joo\\" sound which is used for lesser dangers. During antagonistic encounters, squirrels emit deep growls as signs of aggression. Juvenile squirrels make play calls, nest-chirpings, and protest squeaks. Reproduction Cape ground squirrel mate and reproduce year-round but mating occurs mostly in dry winter months. Since females copulate with multiple males, the males' large testes are useful for sperm competition. After copulation, males will masturbate, which could serve to keep the genitals clean and reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections. In groups, only one female at a time enters oestrus which lasts around three hours. Gestation lasts around 48 days or 42‚Äì49 days. Lactation begins not long before the pups are born. A lactating female isolates herself in a separate burrow to care for their young but she returns to her group after weaning or if her litter is lost for some reason. There are 1-3 pups in a litter. They are born altricial, hairless and blind. The pups stay in the burrows for their first 45 days. By 35 days, the eyes are open. Seven days after emerging from the burrows, the pups can eat solid food. Lactation ends at around 52 days. Males reach sexual maturity at eight months while female mature at 10 months. The former leave their natal groups while the latter remain. Status The Cape ground squirrels populations does not seem to be threatened overall. In some areas, it is persecuted as an agricultural pest. In addition, humans have used poisonous grass to control ground squirrel due to crop damage and rabies. It inhabits protected areas, such as Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park in Botswana and South Africa and Etosha National Park in Namibia.

It is also known simply as HPH, or \\"Health Promoting Hospitals.\\" HPH is based on the settings approach to health promotion philosophy of the WHO as outlined in the WHO Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (WHO 1986). The organization's main aim is to improve the health gain of hospitals and health services by a bundle of strategies targeting patients, staff, and the community.  History  Based on the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, the first conceptual developments on HPH started in 1988. A first model project \\"Health and Hospital\\", was initiated in 1989 at the Rudolfstiftung Hospital in Vienna, Austria, and successfully finished in 1996. 10 model documents (in German language) summarise the learnings from the pilot project and are available online to guide hospital projects related to health promotion. In 1990, the WHO International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals was founded as a multi-city action plan of the WHO Healthy Cities Network. In 1991, the HPH network, which was in the beginning an alliance of experts, launched its first policy document, the Budapest Declaration on Health Promoting Hospitals. This document introduces the HPH concept and target groups - patients, staff, community - as well as related HPH strategies and action areas. In order to implement HPH on a broader basis, a European Pilot Hospital Project of Health Promoting Hospitals was initiated in 1993, and finished in 1997. 20 hospitals from 11 European countries participated, 19 of which finished the project successfully. Also in 1993, the first international HPH conference was organised, and the first international HPH Newsletter was published. Since 1995, national and regional networks of HPH, all coordinated by their own national or regional coordinating centres, are being implemented and developed in order to disseminate HPH to as many hospitals and health care institutions as possible. The development of the HPH networks called for a new policy document: The Vienna Recommendations on Health Promoting Hospitals were launched in 1997. In 2009, HPH has become a global movement with national and regional networks, individual member hospitals and health promotion initiatives on all continents. There are currently around 600 member hospitals in the HPH network from over 20 countries.  Concept  HPH combines a vision, a concept, and a set of 18 core strategies and 5 standards. In accordance to health promotion theory, the HPH standards and strategies are based on the principles of the settings approach to health promotion, empowerment and enablement, participation, a holistic concept of health (somato-psycho-social concept of health), intersectoral cooperation, equity, sustainability, and multi-strategy. This reflects a salutogenic approach. In order to realise the full potential of the comprehensive HPH approach for increasing the health gain of hospital patients, staff, and the community, HPH needs to be supported by an organisational structure: Support from top management, a management structure that embraces all organisatial units, a budget, specific aims and targets, action plans, projects, and programs, standards, guidelines and other tools for implementing health promotion into everyday business. This needs to be supported by evaluation and monitoring, professional training and education, research and dissemination. One way to implement HPH in a hospital or other health care organisation is by linking HPH aims and targets with quality management, thus understanding health promotion as one specific quality aspect in hospitals and health care. Ideally any managerial or professional decision in an HPH should also consider the health/ disease impact of that decision, together with other decision criteria (e.g. effectiveness, sustainability).  Core Documents  The concept of health promotion in hospital and health services is based on 6 policy documents: *Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986) *Budapest Declaration of Health Promoting Hospitals (1991) *Ljubliana Charter on Reforming Health Care (1996) *Jakarta Declaration (1997) *The Vienna Recommendations on Health Promoting Hospitals (1997) *The Bangkok Charter (2006)  Structure & Organization  The International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals is steered by a Governance Board composed of 7 members who are experts in the field of health promotion. In addition to the governance board, 2 standing observers (including J√ºrgen Pelikan) are responsible for organizing a yearly international conference, and the HPH International Secretariat, promote and assist the advancement of the concept of health promotion in hospitals and health services. In an open tender process in May 2019, the General HPH Assembly awarded the International Secretariat to the team of Dr. Oliver Grone at OptiMedis AG. The new International Secretariat has grown the HPH membership base to include health institutions other than hospitals and has broadened the objective of the network in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. Since the end of 2019, the HPH network is become officially known as the International Network of Health Promoting Hospitals & Health Serivces.  Activities = Standards  The HPH network promotes the use of standards developed for implementing health promotion in hospitals. This manual includes self-assessment forms and is available in 6 other languages, including Chinese, German, Russian, French, Japanese, and Persian. The HPH Network is working to develop a broader set of umbrella standards by the end of 2020. HPH members, as well as external experts in the field of health promotion are co-developing the new standard set.  Task Forces and Working Groups  Several task forces and working groups develop specific HPH concepts, strategies and tools on specific subjects or for specific clinical areas: * The environment * Migration, equity, and diversity * Age-friendly health care * Implementation and monitoring of HPH standards * Children and adolescents * Patient and family engaged health care * Health literate health care organizations  International Conference  The HPH Network hosts a yearly, international conference for its members to exchange ideas and advancements in health promotion.

Haemobilia occurs when there is a fistula between a vessel of the splanchnic circulation and the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary system. It can present as acute upper gastrointestinal(UGI) bleeding. It should be considered in upper abdominal pain presenting with UGI bleeding especially when there is a history of liver injury or instrumentation. First recorded in 1654 by Francis Glisson, a Cambridge professor. Presentation Quincke's triad of upper abdominal pain, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and jaundice is classical but only present in 22% cases. It can be immediately life- threatening in major bleeding. However, in minor haemobilia, patient is haemodynamically stable despite significant blood loss being apparent. Causes The causes of haemobilia include trauma (which can be accidental or iatrogenic due to procedures such as cholecystectomy), instrumentation (especially after ERCP), gallstone, inflammatory conditions ranging from ascariasis to PAN, vascular malformation, tumors, coagulopathy, and liver biopsy. Diagnosis Combination of EGD, CT scan and angiography depending on clinical situation, bearing in mind that haemobilia may present many days after injury. Cholangiography is performed if there is a percutaneous access or if ERCP is undertaken. Management Most bleeding from instrumentation are minor and would settle spontaneously. When indicated, management is directed towards stopping bleeding and relieving obstruction if present, which is achieved either by surgical ligation of hepatic artery or by endoscopic embolisation. Endoscopic trans-arterial embolisation (TAE) is preferred initially because of high success rate and less complication. TAE involves the selective catheterization of a hepatic artery followed by embolic occlusion. Surgery is indicated when TAE has failed or sepsis present in biliary tree or drainage has failed.

Adaptations were made by Sphere, Inc., for Spectrum Holobyte, and by Infogrames. It was originally released for MS-DOS and Macintosh in 1989. It was subsequently ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST in 1990 and the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 in 1991. Gameplay Welltris was the first Tetris sequel designed by original designer Alexey Pajitnov, with Andrei Sgenov. It retains that game's falling-block puzzle gameplay but extends the pit into three dimensions while the blocks remain two-dimensional, with the board viewed from above. As blocks descend into the well, they can be rotated or moved left or right along the walls, from one wall to another if desired. Once a block reaches the floor, it will slide as far as possible until stopped by an edge or another piece. Whenever the player completes a solid horizontal or vertical line, it disappears and the remaining squares slide to fill the open space. If a falling block comes to rest with any part of itself still on a wall, that wall is temporarily frozen; no blocks can be moved onto it during this time. Freezing all four walls ends the game. Reception In 1990, Dragon gave the Macintosh IIx version of the game 5 out of 5 stars. MacUser reviewed the Macintosh version of Welltris, praising the new playstyle as compared to its predecessor, and stating that \\"Welltris is both thoughtful and highly addictive.\\" Macworld also reviewed the Mac version, praising its gameplay, music and graphics, summarizing their thoughts by stating \\"[Welltris] successfully extends the Tetris metaphor; cheery folk music and captivating scenes; very challenging.\\" Macworld criticizes the steep learning curve and a point in the game where the speed of the falling pieces become unmanagable, referring to the latter as the \\"one annoying habit\\" that it shares with Tetris. The ZX Spectrum version had mixed reviews, with CRASH awarding 79%, Sinclair User awarding 45% and Your Sinclair giving 79%. The actual gameplay and addictiveness were highlighted as good areas, but criticisms included the fiddly controls and minimal sound and looks.
