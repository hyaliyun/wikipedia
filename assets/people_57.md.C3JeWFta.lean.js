The Grade II listed stone building consists of two two-storey structures, one late medieval and the other added in the 18th century. The building began as an almshouse for workers on the adjoining St John's Bridge in the 1220s, before becoming part of a priory and then an inn. Location The pub is located on the Thames Path close to St John's Lock and St John's Bridge, where the River Cole and the River Leach join the Thames on opposite banks. Mooring for boats is available and small boats can be hired from the pub garden. The pub is on the A417 on the outskirts of Lechlade. There is a camp site next to the pub. The pub owns of fishing rights. History The building was started in the 1220s by Peter Fitzherbert as a hospital or almshouse, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, which had the mandate of caring for workmen on the bridge. The building was part of the Augustinian Lechlade Priory founded in the 13th century by Isabella de Mortimer; in 1252 Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall became its patron. The priory survived until its dissolution in 1472. At that time, the building became known as an inn called Ye Sygne of St John Baptist Head. The name was changed to The Trout Inn in 1704. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, The Trout provided the residence for the lock keeper of St John's Lock; this function was discontinued in 1830 when a lock house was built. The pub is a venue for regular music events, particularly jazz, though one event in January 2014 had to be cancelled because of flooding. The pub serves draught beer and is Cask Marque accredited. Architecture The Trout Inn from the A417 The original, two-storey structure is late medieval. Its interior incorporates timber-beamed ceilings. Near the end of the 18th century, a two-storey addition was made on the northern side; this building features stone construction and a slate roof. The newer structure features a pair of 12-pane sash windows on each floor, a half-glazed door, and a gabled entryway. To the rear of the buildings lie an old-fashioned garden, an orchard, and a pool.

Dimitrios Avramis has claimed a silver medal in the 76-kg division at the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, Italy, picked up a bronze at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, and later represented his nation Greece in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004). Throughout his sporting career, Avramis trained as a member of the Greco-Roman wrestling team for Panellinios G.S. in Athens, under his brother and personal coach Spyridon Avramis. He managed to be Greco-Roman Wrestling Champion in Greece for 15 years in row in every age category, from 1990 to 2004: Junior (1990,1991), Teen (1992,1993), Young (1994, 1995), Men (1995,1996,1997,1998,1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004). His achievement becomes more remarkable, as he didn't lose any fight in Greece from 1990 to 2004. He won his first international metal when he was just 18 years old, at the 1993 European Wrestling Championships in G√∂tzis, Austria, where he picked up the silver metal in the 76-kg division. Avramis emerged himself into the international scene at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, where he picked up the bronze medal in the 76-kg division over Georgia's Tarieli Melelashvili that earned him a spot on the Greek Olympic team. The following year, Avramis made his official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he competed in the men's middleweight division (76 kg). In the prelim pool, he pulled Armenia's Levon Geghamyan off the mat in overtime on his opening bout, but suffered a mighty throw from Sweden's Ara Abrahamian by a 2‚Äì3 sudden death decision. Finishing the pool in second place and twelfth overall, Avramis' performance was not enough to put him through into the quarterfinals. When Greece welcomed the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Avramis qualified as a member of the Greek squad in the men's 84 kg class, by obtaining an automatic bid for the host nation and placing second from the European Championships in Haparanda, Sweden. Entering the Games as a top favorite, Avramis delighted the home crowd inside the Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, as he prevailed two straight matches over Iran's Behrouz Jamshidi and Norway's Fritz Aanes in the round-robin pool to take a coveted spot for the next round. As he faced off against Russia's Alexei Mishin in the quarterfinals, Avramis could not hold his tough opponent into the ring and lost the match 2‚Äì5. With his next opponent Mohamed Abdelfatah of Egypt being disqualified for protesting, Avramis was immediately awarded a spot in the fifth-place match by forfeit.

Childhood Edith Marguerite Harrington was born at 32 Linver Road, Fulham, London, on 14 June 1893, the second of the six children born to George Woods Harrington (1865-1920), an accounts clerk, and his wife Alice Edith Harrington, n√©e Stillman (1865-1935). The son of a butler, her father changed employers many times during his working life but his modest income meant that he always had difficulty accommodating his growing family, moving first to Putney, then to Acton, London and eventually to Isleworth. As was common practice in large Victorian families, the elder children lodged with their grandparents due to space constraints; by 1901 Edith‚Äôs elder brother Cyril was living with his grandfather1901 Census of England and Wales and by 1911 Edith was living there too.1911 Census of England and Wales First marriage and issue On leaving school, Edith found work as a milliner, but by the outbreak of the First World War she had moved on to become a secretary and was living in a small apartment in Hammersmith.Information from marriage certificate Around this time, she met her first husband, Philip Morton Shand, known as Morton, then working as a clerk at the War Office and living at the Shand family home in nearby Kensington. Shand was an English journalist, architecture critic (an early proponent of modernism), wine and food writer, entrepreneur and pomologist. They married at St. Peter's Church, Hammersmith, London on 22 April 1916 and set up home together in a splendid mansion block overlooking Battersea ParkInformation from Bruce Shand's birth certificate where her only child, Bruce Middleton Hope Shand, was born on 22 January 1917. Unfortunately, the marriage was to be a short-lived and unhappy one, ending in divorce after just four years. Shand was to prove a serial womanizer who cared little for his child, and Edith divorced him on grounds of his adultery on 4 July 1920. Thereafter, he failed to acknowledge or provide for his son, marrying three more times and fathering more children.Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair, Gyles Brandreth, Century Publishing, London 2005, , pp. 77-82 Bruce Middleton Hope Shand (22 January 1917 ‚Äì 11 June 2006) subsequently married Rosalind Maud Cubitt, daughter of the 3rd Baron Ashcombe and the former Sonia Rosemary Keppel. They had three children: * Camilla Rosemary Shand (b. 17 July 1947), later, the Duchess of Cornwall * Sonia Annabel Shand (b. 2 February 1949) * Mark Roland Shand (b. 28 June 1951 - 23 April 2014) Second marriage Divorce carried a huge stigma in the 1920s, even for the injured party, and with so many men dead after the war, Edith did well to find a suitable step-father for her child. Her second husband, though lacking the wealth and background of Shand, was to prove a far better husband. In 1921 she married former reservist army officer Herbert Charles Coningsby Tippet, known as Charles, (1891-1947) at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, London. Tippet had been invalided out of the army, suffering from shell shock after serving with distinction on the western front; and had begun a new career as a golf club secretary and golf course designer, an occupation which required him to move wherever contracts took him. In 1921 that meant moving to the United States, which was undergoing a post-war boom in golf course construction. Tippet left for New York in November 1921, and Edith followed him a month later accompanied by her four-year-old son and the boy‚Äôs nanny.White Star Liner \\"Cedric\\" out of Liverpool for New York 10 December 1921, UK Board of Trade, Outward Passenger Lists 1890-1960 After visiting England in June 1923, Edith and her son returned to the U.S. in September 1923 with the stated intent (according to U.S. immigration records) of residing permanently in the United States and taking U.S. citizenship, although this subsequently did not happen.US Department of Immigration records via Ellis Island Foundation During the six years from 1921 to 1927, Edith enjoyed a comfortable life-style with all that America‚Äôs Jazz Age had to offer. Her husband acquired a circle of wealthy and influential associates from the world of golf and Edith Tippet moved around the east coast of the USA from Park Avenue, New York City, to Long Island to Florida, abandoning the name Edith and adopting the more fashionable name of Margot along the way. But when the design contracts came to an end, she and her husband moved back to England in 1927,UK Board of Trade, Incoming Passenger Lists 1878-1960 where he took a succession of appointments as secretary to various prestigious golf clubs. Bruce Shand returned with them to England to begin his education as a boarder at Rugby School. Thereafter, he was to spend more time in the company of his wealthy grandparents than the Tippets. The Tippets lived in London for ten years while he worked at Royal Wimbledon Golf Club; and in 1937 they moved to Walton Heath, occupying a house on the course. A brief spell in Ireland followed in 1938 when Tippet accepted a design contract at Tramore, County Waterford. By 1945, Charles Tippet had been given the job of reviving Rye Golf Club in East Sussex, but it proved too much; on 26 November 1947, after showing his friend the Bishop of Ely around the place, he collapsed and was found on the floor of his office.

It ranks as the fourth most visited local political site in the country, according to site metrics Alexa.com, and it claims to be the first among local independent left-leaning outlets. Most of the site'a content was supportive of the political changes championed by late president Hugo Ch√°vez, but in recent years, it heavily carries opinions and news articles critical of the current government led by Chavez's prot√©g√© Nicolas Maduro, turning it into a \\"gathering place for dissidence within chavismo\\". Aporrea is made up of volunteers who, depending on their personal and work commitments, donate their time to insert the news, complaints, post opinion articles and take to the streets to cover events not covered by other media outlets. History Aporrea was created after the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'√©tat attempt to \\"defend the gains of the 1999 Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the will of the people\\". The site was created by Gonzalo Gomez and Martin Sanchez, who withdrew in 2004 to take up a post as diplomat for the Venezuelan government. Since 2010, the Venezuelan government stopped contracting advertisement on the site, forcing it to run commercial ads. Advertising on the site remains free for cooperatives, small businesses and NGOs.  Censorship  Aporrea is currently censored in Venezuelan government owned Internet service providers. Since February 2019, the site is unreachable to users of Cantv and Movilnet, the State ISPs, which make serve the majority of the country's population. Other local independent media outlets are also affected. The site has been the target of state sponsored attacks aimed at silencing it. \\"Even media claiming to maintain a neutral position, such as Aporrea, were attacked,\\" said Freedom House in one of its reports on Internet freedom in Venezuela. Policies The site claims that the opinions it publishes \\"currently reflect the complex and diverse nature of the left in Venezuela, which gravitates from enthusiastic support for any measure or policy of the current government, to its absolute rejection, with infinite variants (critical support, slight opposition, neutrality, etc.). Aporrea as a team, does not take a public position in this regard, and seeks to remain open to the debate of all the tendencies of the Venezuelan left.\\" Although the site claims to take no official sides in Venezuela's political situation, its current director, Gonzalo Gomez, is known for his opposition to the Maduro government. \\"Maduro deserves to be recalled,\\" said Gomez in reference to a recall referendum against the president. According to Gomez, Aporrea's role as an independent left wing outlet is pivotal, as content critical of government policies \\"have no space in State owned media\\". Aporrea, according to its website, does not support any kind of discrimination based on \\"race, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin, religious affiliation, gender, disability status, skin color, accent when speaking, etc.\\". The website lists rules for opinion articles, one of which asks that users \\"try to be respectful, especially when referring to other columnists of Aporrea or figures of the Bolivarian Government or the left in general, with whom you may have disagreements. We suggest that criticisms and replies to other articles be restricted to responding to arguments, not personal attacks or insults. We reserve the right to reject material which offends, defames, or humiliates others\\". Critical reception Venezuelan Government figures have publicly criticized the site. Diosdado Cabello, the current President of the National Constituent Assembly described Aporrea and its columnists a traitors. \\"Write everything you want, but enough of betrayals! You can write everything you want, nobody forbids it, you are within your rights, but define yourself [politically].\\" According to Manuel Laya of the Communist Party of Venezuela, Aporrea no longer serves its original purpose and was an instrument of the \\"fifth column\\" to hinder the flow of information. According to the Anti- Defamation League (ADL), Aporrea has \\"a record of promoting antisemitic conspiracies\\" and presented multiple articles which they found offensive in their 2014 Antisemitismo en Venezuela report. The Simon Wiesenthal Center also criticized what it considers anti-Semitic commentary on the website. Several other organizations have also criticized the website citing anti-Semitic ideas. Aporrea claims to have removed such content and apologized for it, urging organizations or groups affected to reach out to them directly, promising to honor take down requests for offensive content.

An organic compound is any compound containing carbon, aside from some simple ones discovered before 1828. There are three classes of organic mineral: hydrocarbons (containing just hydrogen and carbon), salts of organic acids, and miscellaneous. Organic minerals are rare, and tend to have specialized settings such as fossilized cacti and bat guano. Mineralogists have used statistical models to predict that there are more undiscovered organic mineral species than known ones. Definition In general, an organic compound is defined as any compound containing carbon, but some compounds are excepted for historical reasons. Before 1828, chemists thought that organic and inorganic compounds were fundamentally different, with the former requiring a vital force that could only come from living organisms. Then Friedrich W√∂hler synthesized urea by heating an inorganic substance called ammonium cyanate, proving that organic compounds could also be created through an inorganic process. Nevertheless, carbon-containing compounds that were already classified as inorganic were not reclassified. These include carbides, simple oxides of carbon such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, carbonates, cyanides and elemental carbon minerals such as graphite and diamond. Organic minerals are rare and difficult to find, often forming crusts on fractures. Early descriptions of organic minerals include mellite in 1793, humboldtine in 1821 and idrialite in 1832. Types In the proposed 10th edition of the Nickel-Strunz classification, organic minerals are one of the ten primary classes of minerals. The class is divided into three subclasses: salts of organic acids, hydrocarbons, and miscellaneous organic minerals. =Hydrocarbons= Blue fluorescence in a carpathite mineral under ultraviolet light. As the name implies, hydrocarbon minerals are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. Some are inorganic forms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds. For example, a rare mineral known as either carpathite, karpatite or pendletonite is nearly pure coronene. Carpathite is deposited as pale yellow flakes in cracks between diorite (an igneous rock) and argillite (a sedimentary rock); it is prized for a beautiful blue fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Other PAC compounds appearing as minerals include fluorene as kratochvilite; and anthracene as ravatite. Others are mixtures: curtisite contains several PAH compounds, including dibenzofluorine, picene, and chrysene, while the most common components of idrialite are tribenzofluorenes. One theory for their formation involves burial of PAH compounds until they reach a temperature where pyrolisis can occur, followed by hydrothermal transport towards the surface, during which the composition of minerals that precipitate out depends on the temperature. =Salts of organic acids= A salt of an organic acid is a compound in which an organic acid is combined with a base. The largest such group is the oxalates, which combine with cations. A large fraction have water molecules attached; examples include weddellite, whewellite, and zhemchuzhnikovite. Oxalates are often associated with particular fossilized biological materials, for example weddellite with cacti; oxammite with guano and egg shells of birds; glushinskite with lichen; humboldtine, stepanovite and whewellite with leaf litter; and humboldtine, stepanovite and whewellite with coal. Where plant material such as tree roots interacts with ore bodies, one can find oxalates with transition metals (moolooite, wheatleyite). Other salts include salts of formate (CHOO‚àí) such as formicaite and dashkovaite; and salts of acetate (C2H3O2‚àí) such as acetamide and calclacite. Joanneumite is the first isocyanurate mineral to be officially recognized. =Miscellaneous= Some organic minerals do not fall into the above categories. These include nickel porphyrin (), closely related to biological molecules such as heme (a porphyrin with iron as the cation) and chlorophyll (a magnesium cation), but does not itself occur in biological systems. Instead, it is found on the surface of fractures in oil shales. Urea derived from bat guano and urine also occurs as a mineral in very arid conditions. In some classifications, In the Dana and Strunz classifications, amber is considered an organic mineral, but this classification is not approved by the International Mineralogical Association (IMA). Other sources call it a mineraloid because it has no crystal structure. Carbon Mineral Challenge As of 2016, the IMA recognized ten hydrocarbon minerals, ten miscellaneous organic minerals, 21 oxalates and over two dozen other salts of organic acids. However, Robert Hazen and colleagues analyzed the known species of carbon-bearing minerals using a statistical technique called the Large Number of Rare Events (LNRE) model, and predicted that at least 145 such minerals are yet to be discovered. Many undiscovered organic minerals may be related to known species by various substitutions of cations. Hazen et al. predict that at least three more PAH crystals (pyrene, chrysene and tetracene) should occur as minerals. There are 72 known synthetic oxalates, some of which could occur in nature, particularly near fossil organisms. To encourage the discovery of more carbon minerals, the Deep Carbon Observatory launched an initiative known as the Carbon Mineral Challenge.

In 1941 she was able to take her elder sister from Belgium to New York, to pursue treatment for her sister's mental illness. Moreno was one of the co-founders of the International Association for Group Psychotherapy. Moreno's contribution to the field of group psychotherapy and psychodrama began immediately upon meeting Dr. J. L. Moreno. Within a year of their meeting J.L. and Moreno founded the Sociometric Institute on Park Avenue, New York City. They established the Psychodramatic Institute in New York in 1942. They began producing the journal Group Psychotherapy (originally called Sociatry) in 1947, publishing a volume of research documenting their application and refinement to the social sciences of sociatry, psychodrama, and sociometry. Moreno was J. L. Moreno's partner and co-creator for over thirty years until his death in 1974. Moreno continued training and teaching the psychodramatic theory and method for more than 30 years since Dr. Moreno's death, training psychodramatists worldwide. Moreno is recognized as a leader in further realizing Dr. Moreno's vision in bringing this method to the lives of communities worldwide. In the 2000s she lived in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The 1.5mm thick butyl rubber waterproof roof membrane was completed in 2017. The original rooftop had access to the amazing panoramic views but no real amenity with unsightly equipment and piping exposed, possibly due to the original developer running short of money towards the end of the construction.

Bauhaus influence  \\"For Benshemesh, it becomes apparent the influence that his time in Tel Aviv studying architecture had on his practice in Melbourne. Known for its extensive influence of the Bauhaus (the German Art School from 1919-1933 that combined crafts and fine arts and informed designers, architects, artists and craftspeople worldwide), Tel Aviv features over 4,000 modernist style buildings built between 1920 and 1940. Within the construction of these buildings was a new dynamic, that of urban densification unseen of at the time: over 4,000 people per square kilometer, which presented itself programmatic and social challenges. These challenges, such as the treatment of interstitial spaces such as the thresholds between public and private, began to manifest in the role of the balcony and vegetated space in the development of these apartment buildings. Here, we see that this social condition is carried over the antip-odean environment Benshemesh ended up in. Whilst Benshemesh was known amongst friends and colleagues to have preferred working on high-rise constructions and not on private house commissions, this doesn't mean there wasn't still consideration of the end- user as an individual as opposed to a collective. It is for this reason that there was consternation in the Benshemesh camp about Edgewater Towers, perhaps his most note-worthy work, on the St Kilda shoreline, when residents starting enclosing their balconies with glazing, thus revising the connection of this threshold space with their neighbours, the environment, and the context\\".  American influence  Robin Boyd's colourful take on Australian architecture and suburban life in 1960 \\"The Australian Ugliness\\" included a concept of American influence in Australia as \\"Austerica\\". \\"Austerica is on no map. It is, an Austerican advertisement would say, not a place but a way of life\\".The Australian Ugliness: Text Classics, R.

Grade 1 water supply from Marine Parade and Spenser Street rises to rooftop tanks (one kitchen/potable and one bathroom/WC ‚ÄòFlushometers'‚Äô, tanks replaced 2007) under mains pressure with back-up duty/standby booster pumps. Level 11 and below served by gravity via vertical piping risers to each flat (one in kitchen and one in bathroom). A further tank is above the East lift roof serving only level 12 by gravity (retrofitted at the time the building opened to solve low water pressure in the penthouse flats). Each flat has two water isolation valves within kitchen and bathroom riser shafts. Vertical risers can be isolated at roof level. Hot water is via water heater (originally gas fired instantaneous) in kitchen with flue in fa√ßade. Hot water piping to bathroom is cast within the concrete floor slab from the kitchen. In ground incoming 50mm water main and 100mm fire main are copper from Spenser Street below car park asphalt (replaced 2013). 50mm water main from Marine Parade is copper (replaced 2013) and 100mm fire main is galvanized piping below the garden area. Water pipework within the building is copper. Electrical substation is located at Spenser Street boundary supplying the Main Electrical room on Ground floor. Electrical Smart meters for Ground to level 3 flats are in the Main Switch Room. Electrical smart meters for flats on other levels are in Electrical cupboards on the upper levels (4, 5 & 6 on level 4; 7, 8 & 9 on level 7 and 10, 11 & 12 on level 10). Vertical waste stacks in each flat (one in the kitchen and one in the bathroom) with a sewer connection to Spenser Street. Vertical stacks in the building are copper, cross-vented (i.e. Drain-waste-vent system) with smaller piping (expansion and contraction of the copper waste stacks in places work hardening the smaller piping connections which have required periodic repair). Mechanical exhaust ventilation from bathrooms (24hr) via roof-mounted exhaust fans. (3 No. fans serving A & B flats; C, D, E & F flats and G & H flats. Duty fans replaced 2007). Redundant standby fans were removed and the remaining duty fans serving A & B and G & H flats were relocated into fire rated plantrooms for improved maintenance service life in 2016 to reduce noise nuisance on the accessible rooftop. Kitchen ventilation is via the fa√ßade. Incoming gas supplies from Marine Parade run adjacent southern and northern boundary fences. Gas meters serving flats up to level 7 are mostly external adjacent boundary fences. Gas to water heater and stove is metered to each flat. Gas meters serving flats on level 8 and above are located in laundries and bike storage rooms on each upper level (flats A, B, C & D in West and flats E, F, G & H in East). Utility gas supply piping from Marine Parade site boundary to all gas meters replaced 2020. Combined fire sprinkler/hydrant and hose reel system to AS2118.1, AS2118.6, AS2419 and BCA.

Its mission is to improve the quality of healthcare in Pennsylvania by collecting and analyzing patient safety information, developing solutions to patient safety issues, and sharing this information through education and collaboration. Its vision is safe healthcare for all patients.\\"Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority's 2017 Annual Report\\" The Authority was established under Act 13 of 2002, the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error (MCARE) Act. The Authority began collecting Serious Events (events that harm the patient) and Incidents (near misses) in June 2004, making Pennsylvania the only state in the United States to require reporting of both of the aforementioned event types. Acute healthcare facilities that report events through the Authority include hospitals, ambulatory surgical facilities, birthing centers, and abortion facilities. In June 2009, the Authority began collecting infection reports from nursing homes.\\"Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority 2009 Annual Report\\" (PDF). From 2004 through 2017, acute healthcare facilities have reported more than 3 million events; and from 2009 through 2017, nursing homes have reported more than 259,000 events. The Authority is charged to take steps to reduce and eliminate such events through the identification of problems evident in the collected data and recommendation of solutions that promote patient safety. Efforts to improve patient safety in Pennsylvania include patient safety liaisons providing education on a facility-by-facility basis, in-depth education programs, collaborative improvement projects with Pennsylvania healthcare facilities, and the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Advisory. The Advisory, a quarterly publication, chronicles events reported to the Authority, ‚Äúespecially those associated with a high combination of frequency, severity, and possibility of solution; novel problems and solutions; and problems in which urgent communication of information could have a significant impact on patient outcomes.‚Äù The Authority received the 2006 John M. Eisenberg Award for advancing patient safety and quality in the Commonwealth, presented by both the Joint Commission and the National Quality Forum. In addition, the Authority received a Cheers Award in 2010 from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices for its educational efforts in preventing medication errors and adverse drug events.

Henry George Keene Life Keene was born at the East India College, Haileybury; Henry George Keene (1781‚Äì1864) was his father. He was educated at Rugby School and Wadham College, Oxford, going to India as an East India Company employee in 1847. His career as an official was limited, but he began to write.s:The Times/1915/Obituary/Henry George Keene From 1847 to 1882 Keene served in the Bengal Civil Service. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857 he was Superintendent at Dehra Doon.In his subsequent service Keene was in frequent disagreement with his superiors, and he confessed that a certain \\"unfortunate habit of levity and not always seasonable joking\\" hindered promotion. A wit and raconteur, he failed to do himself justice as an official. He often had good practical ideas, but was too changeable and too little master of detail to them effect. So when he reached the 35 years' limit he had not got beyond the grade of a district and sessions Judge. But he retired with the decoration of C.I.E., and with a literary reputation which he was able to turn to account in providing for the needs of a large family. Mr. Keene was twice married and is survived by four sons and five daughters.

It won the IPAF award (International Prize for Arabic Fiction) for 2014. The novel was translated into English by Jonathan Wright. The novel is a wartime spin on Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Since 2018 the book is also available as an audiobook at Kitabsawti.com  Plot  In the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, a junk-dealer named Hadi al-Attag collects the scattered body parts of bomb victims with the intention of giving them a proper burial. Al-Attag first stitches the body parts together to create a single body, calling it \\"Whatsitsname\\", but when he leaves the body alone, the spirit of another bomb victim enters the corpse and brings it to life. Whatsitsname starts out on a mission of vengeance, killing those he considers responsible for the deaths of the bomb victims, but his actions spin out of control when he begins justifying the murder of other people for valuable body parts, raising questions around guilt, innocence and justice.  Reception  The New York Times stated that the novel \\"blends the unearthly, the horrific and the mundane to terrific effect\\". A review in Haaretz called Saadawi's writing style clever, combining \\"compassionate moments of grace and sympathy\\" with \\"macabre humor that adds a cynical view of the goings-on\\". British reviewer Sarah Perry suggested that the novel evokes Kafka as well as Shelley, its story emphasizing the pointlessness and surrealism of war.

He was engaged in several negotiations for a possible Union of the Churches with the Byzantine Empire.  Life  Paul's early life is obscure; he hailed from southern Italy, and was Roman Catholic (Latin) bishop of Amisos until 10 July 1345, when he was appointed Latin Archbishop of Smyrna, a town on the Anatolian mainland that had been recently captured from the Aydinid Turks and was still threatened by them. Miniature portrait of John V Palaiologos in advanced age In 1355, following the Ottoman capture of Gallipoli in the previous year, Paul entered into negotiations with the Byzantine emperor, John V Palaiologos, for a rapprochement between Byzantium and the Catholic Church, in exchange for Western military aid. Paul secured considerable concessions from the hard-pressed emperor, including the active promotion of the Latin Church and even the Latin language, the dispatch of his son Manuel as a hostage to the papal court, and the establishment of a permanent papal legation in Constantinople. During his stay in Constantinople, Paul also took part in a theological disputation between Gregory Palamas and Nikephoros Gregoras. In early 1356, Paul, accompanied by the Byzantine ambassador, the megas hetaireiarches Nicholas Sideros, set sail for the papal court at Avignon, where they arrived in early June. Pope Innocent VI answered to the emperor's offers with generalities, and avoided to commit himself to the dispatch of military aid, but sent Peter Thomas and William Conti as papal envoys to Constantinople. The differing priorities and conceptions of the Byzantines and Latins contributed to the petering out and eventual failure of the negotiations: a 1357 letter by John V remained unanswered by Innocent VI until his death in 1362. Map of Amadeus VI's Bulgarian campaign On 15 May 1357, Paul was named Latin Archbishop of Thebes in central Greece, a post he held until 17 April 1366, when he was named titular Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. In 1366‚Äì67, Paul played an active part in the Savoyard crusade of Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, due to his first-hand knowledge of Byzantine internal affairs and politics. In the autumn of 1366, during Amadeus' campaign against the Bulgarians, who held John V captive at the Bulgarian fortress of Vidin, Paul headed a Crusader embassy to the Bulgarian capital, Tirnovo. There he secured the ransoming of a number of Crusader leaders taken captive, as well as of emperor John, in exchange for Amadeus lifting the siege of Varna. In gratitude for his assistance during the crusade, Amadeus gifted Paul with a grey palfrey worth a hundred gold ducats, and wrote to Pope Urban V, recommending that Paul be appointed to the lucrative Latin Archbishopric of Patras, which had recently been vacated through the death of its incumbent, Angelo I Acciaioli. Indeed, on 20 October 1367 the Pope appointed Paul as apostolic administrator of the vacant see. Before his departure for Italy, Amadeus had resumed negotiations with John V for a Union of the Churches. Both the Count and Paul tried to ensure the emperor's commitment to the project by asking for a loan on his behalf to enable Amadeus to return to Italy, in exchange for ceding to him the fortresses that the Savoyards had recently captured, and in exchange of a promise for John himself to appear before the Pope within a short time. Before Paul's and Amadeus' final departure for Italy in June 1367, a disputation was held in the imperial palace between Paul and the former emperor and monk John VI Kantakouzenos‚Äîthe Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople had refused to treat with Paul‚Äîbefore the imperial couple, their sons, and three senior Byzantine prelates. In the disputation, Kantakouzenos managed to convince Paul that in order to resolve the doctrinal differences between East and West, an ecumenical council should be held at Constantinople in the next two years. The notion of an ecumenical council was quickly rejected by the Pope, but John V's visit to the papal court did indeed materialize, with the Byzantine emperor going to Italy and meeting the Pope at Rome in October 1369, where the emperor embraced the Catholic doctrine. Despite John's public submission to the papacy, however, the rewards he and other pro-Westerners in his court had hoped for failed to materialize, and despite John's personal conversion, the prospect of a full Union of the Churches on Rome's terms remained deeply unpopular and was rejected both by the Byzantine church and the populace. Paul died in January or early February 1371.

Deering House also known as the Dyer Library/Saco Museum is an historic house at 371 Main Street in Saco, Maine. Completed in 1870, it is a fine local example of Italianate style. Built for Joseph Godfrey Deering, it was given by his heirs to the city for use as a library. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Architecture and history The Deering House is located on the south side of United States Route 1, a short way north of Saco's central business district. It is a 2-1/2 story brick strucuture, with limestone and wooden trim elements. It has a side-gable roof with a denticulated and bracketed cornice, with a front-facing gable above the centered entrance. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance sheltered by a wide single-story flat-roof porch supported by square columns. Above the entrance are paired round-arch windows, with a half-round window in the gable above. The entrance is flanked by three-side bays, with single sash windows above. A two-story ell extends to the rear, and is further extended by a single-story ell which joins the house to a period carriage house. To the north of the house stands the 1-1/2 story brick complex of the former York Institute. The house was built in 1869-70 by Joseph Godfrey Deering, who began in business as a grocer, but got involved in the lumber industry, creating one of Maine's largest lumber companies. This house was supposedly the first in York County to have running water and indoor toilets. Deering's heirs undertook a series of extensions and alterations to the property, hiring architects John Calvin Stevens and Joseph Stickney to design them. Deering heirs gave the house to the city in 1955 for use as a library. The Dyer Library built the ell connecting the house to the carriage house. The library merged with the adjacent York Institute in 1976 to form the organization now known as Dyer Library/Saco Museum.

Considered one of Asia's top wrestlers in his decade, Kenjeev has collected a total of five medals at the Asian Championships, picked up two bronze in the 84-kg division at the Asian Games (2006 and 2010), and also represented his nation Kyrgyzstan, as a 19-year-old teen, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Throughout his sporting career, Kenjeev trains for Sduschor 1 Wrestling Club in Bishkek, under his personal coach Hakim Makhmudov. Kenjeev qualified for the Kyrgyz squad in the men's 84 kg class at the 2004 Summer Olympics by gaining an allocated bid and placing fourth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. He lost three straight matches to Sweden's Ara Abrahamian, Japan's Shingo Matsumoto, and Slovakia's Attila B√°tky in the four-man prelim pool, finishing thirteenth overall in the final standings. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar, Kenjeev came strong in the same tournament, and proceeded to take home the bronze medal in a match against the host nation's Idrees Rahman with a 14‚Äì6 decision. Kenjeev also sought his bid to compete for his second Olympics in Beijing and possibly London, but finished farther from the top spot twice in the Olympic Qualification Tournament. Despite a double Olympic setback, Kenjeev managed to collect another bronze medal in the 84-kg division at the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, outclassing India's Manoj Kumar by a three-point advantage. Ten years after competing in his first Olympics, Kenjeev reached the peak of his sporting career as he defeated Iranian wrestler Yousef Ghaderian for the gold in the 80-kg division at the 2014 Asian Wrestling Championships in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, producing a remarkable medal tally of five (the other contained a silver and three bronze).

In the early 1870s, Dutchy's father killed a white man and fled to the hills. According to Britton Davis, Dutchy was then persuaded to kill his father by a religious man who urged Dutchy to save his and his father's souls. Davis describes how rumors described Dutchy returning the next day with his father's head. As a member of the Chatto raiding party, Dutchy raided southern Arizona, surrendering to Davis at San Carlos. After being held at Fort Thomas, Dutchy ended up being a trustworthy scout, and he ended up being selected as Emmet Crawford's body-servant. He enlisted on 13 March 1884. He served as a scout with Emmet Crawford and was promoted to sergeant of scouts. Dutchy continued as a scout until late in 1886 until he was indicted by the United States Grand Jury in November 1884 for the murder of Jacob Samuel Ferrin near San Carlos in July 1883.

Instituted on May 3, 1946, it was awarded in recognition of the individual courage shown in resistance against the enemies of the Netherlands and for the maintenance of liberties. It is one of the highest decorations in the Netherlands. Before the Netherlands was liberated in May 1945, the Dutch government in London had developed a valid and balanced system of decorations, both civil and military. In addition to the existing Military Order of William, they were created new ones as the Bronze Lion, the Bronze Cross, the Cross of Merit and the Cross of the Flyer. But there was no valid award to reward members of resistance organizations, while neighboring countries had already filled this gap. As it was not agreed that the acts of the Resistance could be rewarded with an existing military decoration, it was decided to create a specific one. During the war, each of the acts of Resistance was considered as good as any other. In addition, other countries had distinguished the Dutch resistance with decorations such as the British King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom or the American Medal of Freedom. On the other hand, there was Queen Wilhelmine's personal wish that the work of the Resistance was to be rewarded. The cross was awarded in 2 formats: 60x36 mm (2,3x1,4 in) for survivors and 80x48 mm (3,1x1,8 in) for those who received it posthumously. It has been granted 95 times, 93 of them to deceased resistance workers (85 Dutch, 7 French, 2 Belgians and 1 to the Monument to the Jews killed during the Holocaust). Badge A bronze cross on a flame star, and a royal crown on top. In the center is the image of Saint George (symbolizing the Dutch Resistance) killing the dragon (the Nazis). On the arms of the cross is the inscription \\"TROUW TOT IN DEN DOOD\\" (Loyal to death). On the reverse side, a flaming sword breaks a chain in two.

Its text, assembled and partly written by W. H. Auden, with a pacifist slant, puzzled audiences at the premiere, and the work has never achieved the popularity of the composer's later orchestral song- cycles, Les Illuminations, the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings and the Nocturne. Background In the mid-1930s Britten was employed by the GPO Film Unit, composing music for documentary films. Also working for the unit was the poet and critic W. H. Auden, with whom Britten collaborated on the films Coal Face (1935) and Night Mail (1936). Auden was something of a mentor to the young Britten, encouraging him to widen his aesthetic, intellectual and political horizons.Matthews, p. 34 Britten received a commission to compose a work involving orchestra for the 1936 Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Music Festival. Auden assembled the text for an orchestral song cycle, writing some of it and adapting other sections from existing poems. The work, described as a \\"symphonic cycle for high voice and orchestra\\", was composed between May and July 1936 and titled Our Hunting Fathers. On 19 September 1936, less than a week before the premiere, Britten rehearsed the work with the soprano Sophie Wyss and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the loft at Covent Garden. Britten afterwards described the rehearsal as \\"the most catastrophic evening of my life\\" which left him \\"feeling pretty suicidal\\".Britten (1991). Letters from a Life Vol. 1: 1923‚Äì39. Diary, 25 September 1936: p. 443 According to Sophie Wyss, the \\"members of the orchestra were not used to that kind of music and played about disgracefully. When the reference to rats came in the score they ran around pretending they were chasing rats on the floor!\\" Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was present, reproved the orchestra, with the result, Wyss recalls, that the players \\"pulled themselves together\\" in time for the next rehearsal held in Norwich on 21 September.Britten (1991), pp. 443-44 Premiere and reception The premiere was given at the 34th Norfolk and Norwich Triennial Musical Festival on 25 September 1936, conducted by the composer.Britten (1991). Diary, 25 September 1936: p. 446 The performance went without mishap,Matthews, p. 37 leaving \\"most of the audience\\", according to Britten, \\"very interested if bewildered\\". The press reviews ranged \\"from flattering & slightly bewildered (D. Tel.) - to reprehension & disapproving (Times)\\".Britten (1991). Diary, 26 September 1936: p. 447 Richard Capell in The Daily Telegraph wrote: The reviewer in The Observer, comparing the piece unfavourably with Vaughan Williams's Five Tudor Portraits which had been premiered at the festival that same day, wrote: The Times was less severe, but its critic made his dislike of the piece discreetly clear. Although Britten's music had, as a biographer put it, \\"bizarre new sounds\\" calculated to discomfit an audience, most of the opprobrium seems to have been directed at Auden's text.Matthews, pp. 37‚Äì38 Ostensibly about man's relationship with animals it is a not very deeply disguised tract about man's relationship with man, from a left-wing, pacifist viewpoint.Moore, Lloyd. Liner notes to Naxos CD 8.557206, 2004. In April 1937 the BBC broadcast a performance of the work with Wyss and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult;\\"Broadcasting\\", The Times, 30 April 1937, p. 9 the cycle was not performed again until 1950. The analyst Lloyd Moore commented in 2004 that even latterly the work is seldom heard in the concert-hall and \\"must qualify as one of the most neglected of Britten's major works\\". Structure The work lasts about half an hour in performance. It is in five sections: #Prologue ‚Äì words by Auden #Rats Away! ‚Äì anonymous, updated by Auden #Messalina ‚Äì anonymous #Hawking for the Partridge (Dance of Death) ‚Äì words by Thomas Ravenscroft #Epilogue ‚Äì words by Auden. The Prologue is in a form akin to recitative and introduces the cycle's musical motto, described by Moore as \\"a descending major triad climbing back to the minor third\\". \\"Rats Away!\\" is an agitated, shrill section, demanding vocal virtuosity from the soloist, who is gradually overwhelmed by the orchestra, its music suggesting the scurrying of rats. The third section, \\"Messalina\\", is a lyrical elegy for a dead monkey, with a succession of solos for flute, oboe, clarinet and saxophone. The fourth section, \\"Hawking for the Partridge\\" (subtitled Dance of Death) follows without a break, the soloist reciting the names of the dogs joining in the hunt. In Moore's words, \\"The catch itself is marked by a fortissimo unison on the muted brass, after which the soprano isolates the two names 'German, Jew', signifying unambiguously who is the hunter and who the hunted.\\" The work ends with an Epilogue and Funeral March, disrupted by a repetitive motif on the xylophone, bringing the cycle to an equivocal and ambiguous conclusion.

It originated in Ukraine in 2014 having grown from a football chant first performed by FC Metalist Kharkiv ultras and Shaktar Donetsk ultras in March 2014 on the onset of the Russian annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine. The phrase has become very widespread throughout Ukraine among supporters of the Ukrainian government and more generally those who do not like Vladimir Putin in both Russian-speaking and Ukrainian-speaking areas of Ukraine. Language and meaning \\"–ü–¢–ù –•ÃÜ–õ–û\\" (PTN KLO) made of stickers \\"Do not buy Russian goods!\\" The obscene term (mat) is variously transliterated as huilo, huylo, khuilo, khuylo, or xujlo. Its core is (khuy), literally \\"dick\\" in both Russian and Ukrainian. In combination with -lo it may be translated as \\"dickwad\\", \\"dickhead\\" or \\"prick\\". The words are identical in Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian. In West Slavic, the word does not exist, except in Polish, Slovak and some dialects of Czech that have chuj; Polish transliterates as chuj≈Ço. In May 2014, media outlets reported that the Russian profanity khuilo had been added to the Urban Dictionary as a synonym for Vladimir Putin. The expression, for the reason of circumventing censorship, may be abbreviated as \\"\\" (ptn khÃÜlo). The letter is an overlay of the Cyrillic letters , and , a well-known joke about \\"a new Russian letter\\".\\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–µ –±—É–∫–≤—ã —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∞–ª—Ñ–∞–≤–∏—Ç–∞\\" (New Letters of Russian Alphabet), Sergey Muratov, Samizdat Magazine Another abbreviation containing a similarly suggestive meaning is \\"\\" (PTN PNKh), which stands for \\"\\" (Putin, poshol na khuy, which is similar to \\"Putin, go fuck yourself\\", which could be rendered in English as \\"PTN GFY\\"). History The chant has its origins in \\"Surkis Khuylo!\\", a football chant that was initiated by the ultras of FC Metalist Kharkiv some time in 2010, during the height of a feud between two Ukrainian oligarchs, Oleksandr Yaroslavsky, then-owner of \\"Metalist\\", and Hryhoriy Surkis, then-president of the Football Federation of Ukraine who had strong historic and family ties with FC Dynamo Kyiv. The Kharkiv fans, who sided with their club president, chanted \\"Surkis Khuylo!\\" to express their dislike of the Football Federation president in vulgar and profane form. The first recorded public performance of the \\"Putin khuylo!\\" chant and the song that grew from it took place in March 2014 in Kharkiv when the local fans chanted it during their street march. The \\"servant of the people\\" in Russia: after the cut joke about Putin the series was removed from the air, Ukrayinska Pravda (11 December 2019) The recording was soon posted to YouTube where it went viral. Various groups of Ukrainian ultras of all major Ukrainian clubs except one have been historically holding strong pro- Ukrainian, sometimes nationalistic, political views and on the onset of the Russian annexation of Crimea and military intervention in Ukraine combined with Russia-incited anti-Ukrainian violence in the East and South of Ukraine, when the city of Kharkiv was in turmoil, the football fans immediately and unequivocally sided with Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. Soon the song that vulgarly derided Putin gained much wider popularity, spreading among other clubs, such as the fans of Shakhtar Donetsk (Donetsk) and Dynamo Kyiv (Kyiv), who were formerly feuding but sang the song together. During the Russian intervention and partial occupation of Ukraine, the ultras of various Ukrainian clubs set aside their rivalries and chanted the song in joint street marches. The chant continued to grow in popularity and became \\"a nationwide cultural meme\\" according to The Guardian. Alexander J. Motyl reported, \\"A shorthand, more modest version of the lyrics has even entered the popular discourse. If you want to express your views of Putin, all you need do is say 'la-la la-la la-la', and everything's quite clear.\\" Artemy Troitsky identified the melody of the chant as coming from the song \\"Speedy Gonzales\\", a hit for American singer Pat Boone in 1962. In June 2015, the Russian Federal Security Service started a criminal prosecution and investigation of activist Daria Poludova for using the song on the VK social network.Activist Darya Polyudovoy was sued for anti-Putin song (Russian) , by Novaya Gazeta, 26.06.2015 When Russian television channel TNT aired one episode of the Ukrainian sitcom \\"Servant of the People\\" in December 2019, The \\"servant of the people\\" in Russia: after the cut joke about Putin the series was removed from the air, Ukrayinska Pravda (11 December 2019) a scene containing a joke that referenced the song, in which the fictional president played by Volodymyr Zelensky asked \\"Putin hublo?\\" () when told that Putin wore a Hublot watch, was cut out of the episode. The omission occurred only within central Russia and the Moscow region, but not in the eastern regions of the country. In mainstream rock music Several Ukrainian mainstream rock music bands included or adapted the chant into their music. A metal remix, released on April 21, 2014 by AstrogentA, added instrumentation and reworked the video of the March 30 protest chant to depict its spread throughout Ukrainian football clubs. The Ukrainian band Teleri received international attention following the May 6, 2014 release of a song and a video titled \\"Putin Hello!\\" Their song uses a double entendre, substituting the objectionable word \\"khuylo\\" with the English word \\"Hello!\\" Alluding to the \\"Putin Khuylo!\\" chant, the video features band players wearing Ukrainian football club colors and posing as ultras marching and chanting \\"Putin Hello\\" as the refrain of the song. The band members asserted, tongue-in-cheek, that the linking of their song to an offensive anti-Putin chant was a misunderstanding and insisted that the only people who found the chant objectionable were Russians unfamiliar with English. Hromadske.TV aired a live performance of the song by Lemonchiki Project on May 29, 2014. The rock band Druha Rika performed the song at their concert on June 13, 2014.

Deshchytsya pleaded the protesters to refrain from violence directed at the Embassy that would cause a bigger diplomatic scandal. Deshchytsia stated: \\"He (Putin) is a khuylo, but - disperse, please!\\" Shortly afterward, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko nominated a different diplomat to lead the Foreign Affairs ministry. According to the Ukrainian media, the presidential plan to replace the minister was known prior to the incident, being proposed as part of a bigger reshuffle in the Ukrainian government. Soon after, Poroshenko praised the work of Deshchytsia, who was then leaving his ministerial position, and the parliament gave the outgoing minister a standing ovation. Deshchytsia's use of the wording caused widespread discontent among the Russian leadership. However, Geoffrey Pyatt, the US ambassador to Ukraine, wrote on Twitter that minister Deshchytsia's use of the chant had been \\"seeking to defuse a dangerous situation\\", calling Deshchytsia \\"a skilled diplomat and credit to Ukraine.\\" =Arsen Avakov= On July 2, 2014, Arsen Avakov who was a Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs, one of the country's major security agencies, published a Facebook post with a photo he took that showed a bus stop near Sloviansk covered by a \\"Putin Khuilo!\\" graffiti. The minister post included his comment to the picture saying: \\"A private opinion some place near Slovyansk. Aligning myself.\\" A week later, on July 9, 2014, Avakov met the troops of the Kyiv-1 Special Police force battalion. After the traditional drill exchange of \\"Glory to Ukraine!\\" greeting followed by the customary \\"To Heroes, Glory!\\" response, Avakov exclaimed \\"Putin!\\" to which the troops responded \\"khuylo!\\" The minister was clearly happy with the response and gave a \\"Vol'no!\\" (\\"at ease!\\") drill command. International reception In October 2014, Belarusians joined visiting Ukrainians in a performance of the chant by \\"nearly the entire stadium\\" at a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match in Barysaw, Belarus resulting in more than 100 Ukrainian and 30 Belarusian football fans being detained and questioned, reportedly on suspicion of using \\"obscene language\\".

Wagiman: windinyin Description It grows as a shrub or tree up to 12 m (occasionally up to 18 m) in height with grey fissured or tessellated bark. The inflorescences are axillary on old wood, with its bright red flowers being seen from April to October, followed by large, reddish-brown seed pods from November to January. The nectar produced by the flowers attracts honeyeaters and native bees. The trees drop their leaves in the dry season, but new leaves often appear just before the onset of the rainy season. The leaves have two lobes joined like butterfly wings. Distribution and habitat It occurs on red alluvial sandy and loamy soils, often in watercourses and on levees, flood plains, pindan and the margins of monsoonal forests. It is found in the Central Kimberley, Dampierland, Gascoyne, Great Sandy Desert, Northern Kimberley, Ord Victoria Plain, Pilbara and Victoria Bonaparte, Katherine Region, IBRA bioregions. Taxonomy Lysiphyllum cunninghamii was first described in 1852 as Phanera cunninghamii by George Bentham.Bentham, G. in Miquel, F.A.W. (1852), Plantae Junghuhnianae 2: 264 The type specimen (BM000810756) was collected by Allan Cunningham in 1820 at Careening Bay in the Kimberley and is held in the British Museum.BM000810756, British Museum. In 1864, Bentham assigned it to the genus, Bauhinia, and it became Bauhinia cunninghamii,Bentham, G. (1864) Flora Australiensis 2: 295. and in 1956, Hendrik de Wit redescribed it as belonging to the genus, Lysiphyllum, making it Lysiphyllum cunninghamii. Uses The leaves and pods are high in protein and minerals, and are used as fodder for stock. The dense, weeping habit means that wallabies and other animals use the trees to shelter from the heat of the day. Fires made from the wood are smokeless, and so the wood is often used for cooking. Windbreaks are made from the branches. Aborigines sucked nectar from the flowers. They made a decoction from the roots and inner bark, which was used on the skin as an antiseptic, and also drunk to treat fevers and other sicknesses. Ash from the tree is mixed with chewing tobacco, and chewed. A further use is to mix the sap with the nectar to make a chewy and tasty gum (\\"Turkish delight\\").

Scheidegger began racing in the 500 cc solo class, becoming Swiss champion before turning to sidecar competition teaming with Horst Burkhardt to race in grasstrack sidecars. They began their world championship career soon after in 1957 at Monza at the final Grand Prix of the season, finishing an impressive fourth. 1958 brought no world championship success on an underpowered BMW, but 1959 began with a win in the first Grand Prix in France at Clermont-Ferrand followed by third at the Isle of Man TT on the Clypse Course followed by fifth in Germany and a third in Belgium saw the team finish the championship in third overall. For the 1960 season they had no wins, but a series of second and third places meant the team ended up in second position overall. The 1961 season produced two wins at France and Belgium and three runner up positions, but they again finished second in the championship. In the 1962 season Scheidegger first teamed with British passenger John Robinson, after Burkhardt initially left to race solos, then teamed with Florian Camathias. By the end of season they were in third position after a win, a second and a third. 1963 was again with Robinson, and again a third place in the championship, following a win, two seconds and a third. The 1964 season began with a win in France and ended with a win in Germany along with a second and a third to clinch them second place in the world title. 1965 was a dominant performance from Scheideggder and Robinson with four wins and three second places netting them the world championship at the last round at Monza. If 1965 was a great performance, 1966 was even more so with the team winning every race, but with much controversy. They were excluded for a fuel irregularity at the Isle of Man TT, awarding the championship to Max Deubel and Emil H√∂rner, but reinstated three months later on appeal. Scheidegger was killed while leading a race at Mallory Park in 1967. Scheidegger's BMW outfit crashed at high speed at Shaw's Corner after a defective bracket holding both the rear brake torque arm and the gear change cross shaft failed. At the following inquest, it was also disclosed that the bracket had not been properly brazed and that it's brazing had been cracked for some considerable time.

Dawkins' served as the Mayor of Fayetteville, North Carolina, from 1987 until 2000, the longest tenure of any mayor in the city's history. He died in office on May 30, 2000. Dawkins also served on the Fayetteville City Council for the twelve years prior to his election as mayor in 1987. Biography =Early life= Dawkins was born on November 25, 1935, in Cumberland County, North Carolina. His father, Johnny L. Dawkins, was a member of the North Carolina General Assembly. J.L. Dawkins reportedly proclaimed that he would be Mayor of Fayetteville when he was just 12 years old. =Political career= Dawkins' career in Fayetteville city government spanned more than twenty-five years. He served on the Fayetteville City Council for twelve years, from 1975 to 1987. Dawkins was first elected Mayor of Fayetteville in 1987, succeeding outgoing Mayor Bill Hurley. Dawkins would ultimately win re-election for seven terms. (Mayors of Fayetteville are elected for two-year terms in office). Dawkins was a proponent of the city's downtown revitalization. He sought to change downtown's former reputation for high crime and urban decay throughout his tenure as mayor. Dawkins was known for working more than 60 hours per week while in office. The Fayetteville City Council honored Dawkins in 1998 with a plaque installed in a newly renovated area of downtown, which the council renamed Dawkins Plaza. The plaque reads, \\"J.L. Dawkins' powerful devotion to service for all citizens of Fayetteville is strongly demonstrated by his quarter century of humble public service. His intense love of people and of his city motivated him to strive for quality development and beautification of his beloved community. The profound passion of J.L. Dawkins for his city is evident in his untiring endeavors to make Fayetteville a better place for all.\\" In 1993, Dawkins was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His cancer went into remission following surgery and chemotherapy. However, the cancer returned in 1998. He underwent months of chemotherapy at the UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. He cited his granddaughter, Jill, who had been diagnosed with brain tumor at the age of 3, as his inspiration. In September 1998, Dawkins announced his intention to run for re-election in 1999 during his treatment. Dawkins was re-elected to his seventh term as mayor in November 1999, winning nearly 75% of the vote. Dawkins stopped attending city council meetings beginning in February 2000 due to declining health, but he continued to work on official business from home until his death in May 2000. Mayor J.L. Dawkins died in office at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center in Fayetteville on Tuesday, May 30, 2000, at the age of 64. He was serving his seventh term as mayor at the time of his death. Dawkins was survived by his wife, Mary Anne Evans; two children, John L. Dawkins III and Dawn Marie Caison; and four grandchildren. Milo McBryde, the city council's Mayor Pro Tem at the time, became acting mayor following Dawkins death. In August 2000, after months of negotiations, McBryde was elected mayor by city council to fulfill the remainder of Dawkins' unexpired term. McBryde was sworn into office on August 21, 2000.

The rankings are compiled by the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (Dutch: Centrum voor Wetenschap en Technologische Studies, CWTS) at Leiden University in the Netherlands. The Clarivate Analytics bibliographic database Web of Science is used as the source of the publication and citation data. The Leiden Ranking ranks universities worldwide by number of academic publications according to the volume and citation impact of the publications at those institutions. The rankings take into account differences in language, discipline and institutional size. Multiple ranking lists are released according to various bibliometric normalization and impact indicators, including the number of publications, citations per publication, and field-normalized impact per publication. In addition to citation impact, the Leiding Ranking also ranks universities by scientific collaboration, including collaboration with other institutions and collaboration with an industry partner. The first edition of the Leiden Ranking was produced in 2007.Waltman, Ludo et al., The Leiden Ranking 2011/2012: Data collection, indicators, and interpretation, Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) , Leiden University, 16 July 2012 The 2014 rankings include 750 universities worldwide, which were selected based on the number of articles and reviews published by authors affiliated with those institutions in 2009‚Äì2012 in so-called \\"core\\" journals, a set of English- language journals with international scope and a \\"sufficiently large\\" number of references in the Web of Science database. According to the Centre for Science and Technology Studies the crown indicator is Indicator 4 (PP top 10%), and is the only one presented in university rankings by the State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation website (UniversityRankings.ch).  Results  Rockefeller University was ranked first in 2014 by citation impact As in other university rankings, Leiden's top 20 is heavily dominated by American universities. In the 2014 rankings, Rockefeller University was first by citation impact, as measured by both mean citation score and mean normalized citation score, as well as by the proportion of papers belonging to the top 10% in their field. Notably, the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, and other British universities score much lower than in other university rankings, such as the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings, which are based in part on reputational surveys among academics. When measuring by collaboration with other universities (the proportion of number of publications co-authored with other institutions), the top three spots were occupied by National Yang- Ming University and two other institutions from Taiwan in 2014, followed by universities from France, the United Kingdom and a number of other European countries. King Abdulaziz University and King Saud University in Saudi Arabia led the list in 2014 when measured by international collaboration.  Indicators  The Leiden Ranking ranks universities by the following indicators: = Citation impact = * MCS ‚Äì mean citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university. * MNCS ‚Äì mean normalized citation score. The average number of citations of the publications of a university, normalized for field differences and publication year. For example, an MNCS value of 2 means that the publications of a university have been cited twice above world average. * PP(top 10%) ‚Äì proportion of top 10% publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that belong to the top 10% most frequently cited, compared with other publications in the same field and in the same year. = Scientific collaboration = * PP(collab) ‚Äì proportion of interinstitutionally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more other organizations. * PP(int collab) ‚Äì proportion of internationally collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored by two or more countries. * PP(UI collab) ‚Äì proportion of collaborative publications with industry. The proportion of the publications of a university that have been co-authored with one or more industrial partners. * PP(<100 km) ‚Äì proportion of short-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of less than 100 km. * PP(>1000 km) ‚Äì proportion of long-distance collaborative publications. The proportion of the publications of a university with a geographical collaboration distance of more than 1000 km.  Criticism  In a 2010 article, Loet Leydesdorff criticized the method used by the Leiden Ranking to normalize citation impact by subject field. The mean normalized citation score (MNCS) indicator is based on the ISI subject category classification used in Web of Science, which was \\"not designed for the scientometric evaluation, but for the purpose of information retrieval\\".Leydesdorff, Loet & Opthof, Tobias, Normalization, CWTS indicators, and the Leiden Rankings: Differences in citation behavior at the level of fields, 2010 Also, normalizing at a higher aggregation level, rather than at the level of individual publications, gives more weight to older publications, particularly reviews, and to publications in fields where citation levels are traditionally higher.Andrejs Rauhvargers, Global University Rankings And Their Impact , European University Association, 2011  References   External links  * Website of the CWTS Leiden Ranking Category:University and college rankings Category:Bibliometrics Category:Leiden University ","title":"CWTS Leiden Ranking"},{"id":"43058897","text":"Saint Margaret's Chapel, Epfig is an 11th-century Romanesque church in the hamlet of Saint Margaret, near Epfig in the Lower Rhine Department of Alsace, France.

The monument is represented in the coat of arms of Bashkortostan. It was built in 1967.History of Yulaev monument (in Russian)  History  For the first time, Soslanbek Tavasiev heard about Salawat Yulayev , in July 1941, when he was evacuated to Bashkortostan from Moscow, because on June 22, 1941 Germany launched a war against the Soviet Union. The family of Soslanbek Tavasiev was evacuated to the Bashkir village of Sterlibashevo. At the local market, Tavasiev heard an emotional speech from a local resident that the country needed heroes like Salawat. The author decided to portray the hero at the moment when Salawat leads the army to help Pugachev to Orenburg (1774). On the mountain, the horseman decisively stops his horse, and calls on people to go to fight. This moment formed the basis of the plot of the composition. Tavasiev was thinking about the future development of Ufa and wanted the sculpture to stand here for a long time and be visible from all sides. Therefore, he chose one of the highest places in the city, at the end of Chishminskaya Street on a hill before descending to the Agidel (Belaya) River. The installation of the architectural composition in this place was associated with financial difficulties, it would have to demolish dozens of private houses and resettle tenants. But the sculptor did not agree to erect the monument in another place. Tavasiev worked on the monument to Salawat Yulaev for 20 years. The monument created by the national sculptor, monumentalist and artist of North Ossetia and Bashkortostan Soslanbek Tavasiev was unveiled on November 17, 1967 and on the high bank Belaya river in Ufa. The monument to Salavat became the hallmark of Ufa and a national treasure. The image of the monument is on coat of arms of Bashkortostan.Account Suspended The monument is unique in that with a weight of 40 tons it has only three fulcrum points. The height of the monument reaches 9.8 meters, with a pedestal 14 m. Salawat Yulayev monument The full-scale model of the monument made of gypsum was completed by 1963, was discussed by specialists in Moscow and officially adopted by the board of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR. Then Tavasiev brought her to Ufa, where she was installed in the lobby Bashkir State Opera and Ballet Theater. The sculptor finalized the monument, taking into account the comments of the residents of Ufa. The sculpture was cast for a month and a half at the Leningrad plant \\"Monument sculpture.\\" To strengthen the sculpture, a steel frame was installed inside it, embedded in a reinforced concrete pedestal and passed through its resting legs, the hollow body of the horse and the figure of the rider. In 1970, for the monument to Salawat Yulayev, Soslanbek Dafaevich Tavasiev was awarded State Prize of the USSR.  Composition  The monument is a sculpture of Salawat Yulaev on a horse. In his right hand, Salavat holds a whip, and a saber is mounted on his left side. The monument is made of bronze cast iron. The pedestal is made of reinforced concrete, lined with granite slabs. The area around the monument is lined with colored plates and landscaped. The monument is fenced with openwork metal bars.  Facts  * The monument is a place of pilgrimage for tourists.

Bridge history  Lanes with name plate Construction on the bridge's predecessor, the Admiral- Graf-Spee-Br√ºcke, was started on 12 January 1934 and the bridge was inaugurated on 22 May 1936 by then-minister Joseph Goebbels. Total building cost was 6.75 million Reichsmark. Like the Duisburg-Hochfeld Railway Bridge, the bridge was blown up by the retreating Wehrmacht on 4 March 1945. Only the floodplain bridge on the left bank of the Rhine remained. In July 1945, a new bridge was already under construction and the bridge was opened to traffic on 3 July 1950. Following a recommendation of Krupp Stahlbau Rheinhausen, the new bridge was built as a Tied-arch bridge, the largest of its kind in Germany at the time with a span of 255.9 metres. While the previous bridge had four lanes, the British Military government insisted on a three-lane bridge. The bridge was thoroughly renovated in the early 1990s, especially the old floodplain bridge parts. Since a few years, it is possible to adjust the direction of the lanes to current demand by a traffic light system.  Technical data  * Type of construction: Tied-arch bridge * Arch width: 255.91 m * Pfeilh√∂he 35.5 m * Versteifungstr√§ger: einwandig genietete Blechtr√§ger mit 4320 mm Stegblechh√∂he * Abstand der Versteifungstr√§ger: 12.4 m * Stegh√∂he des Hutquerschnitts: 1.7 m am Scheitel, 2.10 m am K√§mpfer * Carriageway width: 9 m (3 lanes at 3 m each) * Cycle lane width: 1.1 m * Footpath width: 1.8 m  Naming  In 1987, Rheinhausen was present in the media due to the protests against the closing of the local steelworks. On 10 December 1987 the bridge was occupied by Krupp workers to protest against the closure of their plant.Deutsches Historisches Museum: Fotografie Demonstration auf der Rheinhausener Rheinbr√ºcke During the whole winter of 1987 and 1988 large demonstrations against the closing of the remaining smeltery followed. Apart from the Rhine bridge, protesters also occupied the Bundesautobahn 40 and blockaded the Krupp head offices at Villa H√ºgel in Essen. Pickets accompanied the conflicts for months. Therefore, Rheinhausen became a synonym for steel crisis. The Rheinhausen-Hochfeld bridge was renamed to Br√ºcke der Solidarit√§t by the protesting workers on 20 January 1988. On this day, 50,000 steel workers from more than 60 melteries marched to the bridge. The apprentices of the Krupp training workshop manufactured the new name plate overnight.Der Mythos von Rheinhausen (PDF; 8,0 MB). Was machen die Gewerkschaften heute? fluter.

The class was used to work express trains operated by the Belgian State Railways and its successor, the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB), which was established in 1926. The locomotives were noteworthy for their unusually short boiler, which ended behind all four cylinders. This was due to the class sharing the boiler design with the Type 36 2-10-0 freight design, and the 2-10-0's weight limitations determined the length of the boiler. There were two sub-types of the Type 10 * The first 29 engines were the most powerful ; they mostly ran over hilly main lines, including the tough between Brussels, Namur, Arlon and Luxembourg City ; * The last 29 were slightly lighter and had a smaller firebox ; they were intended for easier lines, including the level line between Brussels and Ostend. Despite these differences, the last sub-type was used extensively, on the Luxembourg line. Some type 10, captured by the Germans in World War I ; several damaged or worn out engines were cannibalized for spares and scrapped during the occupation of Belgium. After the war, between the 1920s and the 1940s the surviving type 10 were gradually upgraded with new superheaters, Legein or Kylchap dual exhaust, ACFI feedwater heather, smoke lifters, duplex air pumps, larger tenders borrowed from war reparation locomotives. Despite being newer and fitted with a huge firebox, the new Type 1 Pacific, built in 1935, couldn't outperform the old Type 10, especially on steep inclines. The Type 5 Mikado, built in 1930 for the heaviest trains on the Luxembourg line, had many shortcomings and failed to replace the Type 10 as well. The class was withdrawn in 1956 when the Luxembourg line was electrified but four Type 10 were displaced to Brussels South and used, until 1959, along with Type 1. One member of the class, no. 10.018, has been preserved by the NMBS/SNCB for display at Train World, the Belgian national railway museum.

Gronsky's book Pastoral was published in 2013. As Mikhail Iampolski, professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, writes in the introduction, \\"The title of the cycle is ironic. A pastoral always depicts a rural idyll, in contrast to the life of city dwellers, to whom it is addressed. In Gronsky‚Äôs cycle, the cardinal difference between the rural, the natural and the urban is lifted. This particular pastoral is not about a contrast, but about an indefinite transition.\\" The critic Sean O'Hagan, reviewing Pastoral in The Observer, said \\"It is essentially, a book about how people use ‚Äì and abuse ‚Äì the precious green spaces available to them.\\" Gronsky says he spent two years familiarising himself with all the suburbs of Moscow and a further two years photographing those he considered interesting. Rather than use a large format camera with a tripod as is typical for this style of photography, he kept his equipment to a minimum, using just a portable Mamiya 7 camera.\\"2012, Daily Life , 3rd prize stories , Alexander Gronsky \\", World Press Photo. This portability meant he did not look like a photographer, and gave him greater agility whilst composing to react to peoples' movements. Genevieve Fussell, writing in The New Yorker, said the work included \\"measured compositions and a deft use of color\\". O'Hagan also said \\"In photography, the edgeland has also become a prevailing subject in recent years, [. . .] If this is much travelled- territory, Gronsky nevertheless makes it his own.\\" Alexander Strecker, writing in LensCulture, said \\"Gronsky is a landscape photographer at heart.

Family background Elizabeth was born to Ulrich II, Count of Celje and his wife Catherine Brankoviƒá, daughter of the Serb despot George Brankoviƒá. Her father was a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, with extensive domains in both the Empire and in the Kingdom of Hungary, centered in Lower Styria, Carniola, and Slavonia. Her mother was the sister of Mara Brankoviƒá, a favorite wife of the Ottoman sultan Murad II. Elizabeth was most likely born in Celje, the family seat. She seems to have had a twin sister, called Catherine, who died as a child. Elizabeth was baptised in the Eastern Orthodox faith of her mother, an arrangement that aroused consternation in the Roman Catholic milieu of Celje. Both of her brothers, Hermann IV and George, died by 1452. Thereafter she remained her parent's sole child, and the last offspring of the House of Celje. Betrothal Elizabeth was initially betrothed to John of Gorizia, son of count Henry IV of Gorizia, who was living in Celje under the tutelage of her father. However, it was later decided she would marry into the Hunyadi family. Elizabeth's father and maternal grandfather were long-time opponents of John Hunyadi, as the houses of Celje and Hunyadi were competing for influence in the Kingdom of Hungary since the early 1440s. In June 1448, the two parties reached an agreement on the division of spheres of interest, sealed by Elizabeth's betrothal to Ladislaus, John Hunyadi's firstborn son. In the autumn of the same year, Hunyadi was defeated by the Ottomans at Kosovo; captured by George Brankoviƒá during his retreat, he was forced to return several estates to him. With the help of the pope, Hunyadi had the disvantageous agreement dissolved; as a conseuqence, the settlement with the Celjes was called off, as well. Under pressure from the estates, protracted negotiations ensued. In August 1451, a settlement was reached in Smederevo. This time, it was agreed that Elizabeth would marry John's second-born son, Matthias. The wedding was set to 6 December 1453, with the stipulation that should the marriage fail to materialize because any fault attributable to Brankoviƒá, the latter‚Äôs castles and other estates in Hungary would be transferred to Hunyadi and his sons. It was John Hunyadi himself, however, to call of the wedding few months before it was to take place. In the fall of 1453, in fact, Elizabeth's father fell out of favor with king Ladislaus, and Hunyadi took advantage of the situation to dissolve the alliance with the Celjes which limited his autonomy of action in Hungary. By February 1455, however, Ulrich was back in power, and George Brankoviƒá was instrumental in renewing the alliance between his son-in-law and Hunyadi in order to secure a common front against the Ottoman threat.  Marriage and death  Following a renewal of the Celje-Hunyadi alliance, Elizabeth was married to Matthias in the spring of 1455, after having converted to Catholicism. By this time, Ulrich of Celje had remained without sons, with his wife approaching forty: Matthias thus became his most likely heir. He was sent to the royal court in Buda where Ulrich now resided as regent, while Elizabeth settled in the Hunyadis' estates; the two young spouses thus served mostly as hostages between their respective families. In the winter of 1455, Elizabeth fell seriously ill. The famous preacher John Capistran organized public prayers for her recovery. However, she died before the end of the year at the Hunyadi court in Transylvania. With her death, Ulrich of Celje remained childless, and the last link between the Hunyadi and Celje families was cut.

Much about the group is controversial, including its membership: it has been said that \\"the three words 'the Bloomsbury group' have been so much used as to have become almost unusable\\".Lee, p. 262 Group of friends and relatives that became a movement The Bloomsbury group started as a loose collective of friends and relatives living near Bloomsbury in London. Some of them knew each other from their time as students in Cambridge. Around World War I most of its key members had left the Bloomsbury area, where some of them later returned. The members of the Bloomsbury Group denied being a group in any formal sense, they however shared common values, among which was a strong belief in the arts.Ousby, p. 95 =Core members= The group had ten core members:Avery, p. 33. * Clive Bell, art critic * Vanessa Bell, post-impressionist painter * E. M. Forster, fiction writer * Roger Fry, art critic and post-impressionist painter * Duncan Grant, post-impressionist painter, who later became a member of the Camden Town Group * John Maynard Keynes, economist * Desmond MacCarthy, literary journalist * Lytton Strachey, biographer * Leonard Woolf, essayist and non-fiction writer * Virginia Woolf, fiction writer and essayist =Included according to Leonard Woolf= In the 1960s, Leonard Woolf additionally listed the following Bloomsbury Group members:Lee, p. 263 *\\"Old Bloomsbury\\": ** Adrian Stephen ** Karin Stephen ** Saxon Sydney-Turner ** Mary (Molly) MacCarthy *Later additions: ** Julian Bell ** Quentin Bell ** Angelica Bell ** David Garnett =Mentioned in various sources as included in the Bloomsbury Group= Various sources include the following: * Lady Ottoline Morrell * Dora Carrington * James Strachey * Alix Strachey * Lydia Lopokova, Keynes' wife, accepted in the groupClarke, p. 56 Generally not seen as members of the Bloomsbury Group =Died before the group really existed= * Thoby Stephen, brother to key members Adrian Stephen, Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell =Omega Workshops= Roger Fry and other Bloomsbury Group artists such as Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant were involved in the Omega Workshops, a business which traded from 1913 to 1919. Other designers and manufacturers at the Workshops were not necessarily members of the Bloomsbury Group. =Ottoline Morrell circle= The Bloomsbury Group only partially identified with Lady Ottoline Morrell, but attended her parties at Garsington Manor. Others present: * Eardley Knollys * Philip Morrell * Aldous Huxley and his wife Maria Nys =Hogarth Press= Hogarth Press was the publishing house owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf after they had left the Bloomsbury area in 1917. Staff members and authors published by that company were not necessarily part of the Bloomsbury Group. The following are generally not seen as part of the Bloomsbury Group: * Published by Hogarth Press: ** T. S.

While still in the Bloomsbury area, LGBT activity was all very much in a single group (e.g. Duncan Grant, a homosexual with bisexual leanings,Angelica Garnett, Deceived with Kindness (1984) p. 33 (in 1995 edition) having affairs with Maynard Keynes, James Strachey, Adrian Stephen, David Garnett and straight Vanessa Bell). Names of LGBT people outside the Bloomsbury Group strictly speaking include: * Mary Garman * Nina Hamnett * Jane Ellen Harrison * Rupert Brooke * Arthur Hobhouse Later the groups differentiated. Keynes married Lopokova, and no longer belonged to any of the LGBT groups. Other groups more or less split according to the location of the members: * Lady Ottoline Morrell provided housing for Aldous Huxley at Garsington where he was married to Maria Nys after the war. * Also Duncan Grant and David Garnett had to work on the land as conscientious objectors during World War I. They started living with Vanessa Bell (also her son Julian) in Charleston Farmhouse: ** Francis Birrell started a bookshop together with David Garnett later on. Dora Carrington, Ralph Partridge and Lytton Stratchey at Ham Spray House * Also during the First World War, Lytton Strachey and Dora Carrington moved to Tidmarsh Mill House, Berkshire.

The operation was launched on 15 June 2014 in North Waziristan along the Durand Line as a renewed effort against militancy in the wake of the 8 June attack on Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, for which the TTP and the IMU claimed responsibility. As of 14 July 2014, the operation internally displaced about 929,859 people belonging to 80,302 families from North Waziristan. Part of the war in North-West Pakistan, up to 30,000 Pakistani soldiers were involved in Zarb-e-Azb, described as a \\"comprehensive operation\\" to flush out all foreign and local militants hiding in North Waziristan. The operation has received widespread support from the Pakistani political, defence and civilian sectors. As a consequence, the overall security situation improved and terrorist attacks in Pakistan dropped to a six-year low since 2008. Zarb-e-Azb was followed by Operation Radd-ul- Fasaad which began in February 2017, following a resurgence in terrorist incidents. Etymologies Zarb-e-Azb ( ALA-LC: ) means \\"sharp and cutting strike\\". Azb also refers to the sword owned by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, which he used in the battles of Badr and Uhud. Strategy For the first time, the Pakistani military implemented a military strategy called \\"Seek, Destroy, Clear, Hold.\\" The Pakistani military will seek the target. Once found, it will be destroyed. When destroyed, the infrastructure, bodies and weapons will be cleared and the area will be held both during this time and after its completion to ensure post-operation security and infrastructure rebuilding and/or area rehabilitation. The Seek and Destroy component is from the Vietnam War whereas the Clear and hold component is from the Iraq War. The Pakistani military combined the two doctrines as a single doctrine for the operation to be successful. Background =Peace negotiations= Peace negotiations with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called for the implementation of Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held within the framework of the Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014. Besides the meetings at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The government had indicated that stronger military action would be implemented if the talks failed. Failure Negotiations collapsed after the execution of 23 Pakistani Frontier Corps soldiers by the Taliban on 17 February 2014. The soldiers had been held by the insurgents since 2010, and on 17 April 2014 the TTP formally ended the ceasefire. Taliban infighting since March 2014 killed more than 90 militants. The strife, triggered by differences between the Mehsud group (led by Sheheryar Mehsud) and another TTP faction (led by Khan Said Sajna), impeded the negotiations. The negotiations were irreversibly damaged by a terrorist attack on Karachi Airport for which the Taliban claimed responsibility and which killed 28 people (including security personnel). A Pakistani military official was quoted to have said, \\"The army is ready for an operation.\\" =Jinnah Airport attack= The operation began one week after a terrorist attack on Pakistan's busiest airport. On 8 June 2014, 10 militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and TTP attacked Jinnah International Airport, Karachi, killing 28 people including security personnel and wounding at least 18. In retaliation, the Pakistani military launched a series of air-strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in the areas bordering Afghanistan. At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June. The figure also included foreign militants killed. Two drone attacks on 12 June killed Uzbek, Afghan and local militants. On 15 June the Pakistani military intensified air-strikes and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts, killing as many as 140 militants (most Uzbek, including persons linked to the airport attack and airport attack commander and mastermind Abu Abdur Rehman Almani) in North Waziristan. Preparations The Pakistani military had prepared for the operation long before, and the government prepared for a three-front operation: isolating targeted militant groups, obtaining support from the political parties and saving civilians from the backlash of the operation. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the nation stood by its military: \\"The decision was taken after the strategy of dialogue failed. The operation will continue until it reaches its logical conclusion. Any group that challenges Pakistan's constitution, attacks civilians, soldiers, and government installations and uses Pakistani territory to plan terrorist attacks will be targeted\\". Asif added that internally displaced persons would be assisted by the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments: \\"We will try to ensure that the displaced do not have to stay away from their homes for too long.\\" The combat troops encircled militant bases in the towns of Mirali and Miranshah. Pakistani officials said that the Afghan's National Security Forces (ANSF) were requested to seal the border on their side so that militants do not escape. The operation involved the Air Force, Navy artillery, tanks and ground troops. According to a military statement, \\"On the directions of the government, armed forces of Pakistan have launched a comprehensive operation against foreign and local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan.\\" An official with the military said that between 14,000 and 20,000 soldiers were normally stationed in North Waziristan before the operation, and he expected the offensive to require no more than a total of 30,000 troops.

DG ISPR Asim Saleem Bajwa reported that 2,763 militants had been killed so far, including 218 terrorist commanders in 9,000 intelligence based operations (IBOs). \\"Some 837 hideouts of terrorists have been destroyed and 253 tonnes of explosives recovered so far during the operation\\", he said. The Army also recovered 18,087 weapons, including heavy machine guns, light machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers and AK-47s . Bajwa said that thousands of terrorists were also arrested, their strongholds cleared and their communication infrastructure destroyed. \\"347 officers and soldiers of Pakistan Armed Forces have embraced martyrdom\\", he added. The year 2015 was declared to be \\"a year of victory\\" and the operation itself a \\"manifestation of the resolve to root out terrorism in the country\\" by the Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif. Final phase One and a half years after the start of Zarb-e-Azb, phenomenal successes were achieved, with the last pockets close to the Pakistan-Afghan border being cleared. Terrorist backbone broken and structure dismantled. Nexus with sleeper cells largely disrupted. Intelligence based Operations (IBOs) busted remaining sleeper cells. 3,400 terrorists were killed, with 837 hideouts from where they were carrying out terrorist activities destroyed. During the last 18 months over 13,200 IBOs carried out across the country in which 183 terrorists were killed, 2,193 arrested. IBOs continue. 488 officers and men of Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps KPK, Baluchistan, Rangers Sindh were killed and 1,914 injured in Operation Zarb-e- Azb. Total 11 military courts. 142 cases referred to military courts. 55 cases decided, 87 cases in process. 31 terrorists convicted. In July, the Pakistan Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif visited the military's forward-most positions near the Afghan border in North Waziristan He was briefed about the progress and future plans for Operation Zarb-e-Azb. Sharif also visited South Waziristan and Wana agencies. It was reported that the Pakistani military had just completed the preliminary preparations for final phase. In the area around Shawal, peaks were cleared. Management of displaced civilians As a result of the operation, 929,859 displaced civilians (from 80,302 families) were registered by Pakistani authorities as of 14 July. Financial support, relief goods and food packages were being distributed and 59 donation points were established across Pakistan by the army. On 10 July, the Foreign Office of Pakistan said that the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons was an internal matter and reiterated that Pakistan had not requested international assistance. \\"We have very clear instructions from the prime minister [to not seek external assistance], Pakistan has neither made nor intends to make a request for international assistance. It has been made very clear that all expenditure related to temporarily displaced Pakistanis will be met from our own resources\\", Pakistani Foreign Office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam said. However, it was reported that the United States allocated $31 million for IDPs and an additional $9.3 million for health, hygiene, water and sanitation for IDPs and livestock. It was also reported that the United Arab Emirates government allocated $20.5 million in IDP humanitarian aid. In February 2014, the Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar told a visiting US Senator Jack Reed that the cost of the operation so far had reached and could go as high as . =Return of the IDPs= On 8 December 2014, the military approved the phased repatriation of the IDPs. The Pakistani army chief said the early return of the IDPs was his top priority. According to senior military officials, civilian authorities were directed to plan the return of the IDPs to their homes in areas which have been cleared of terrorists. On 31 March 2015, the repatriation started. On the first day, 219 IDPs belonging to 62 families left Bannu for Spinwam and Shahmeri in North Waziristan. In the first phase till 24 April, about 1,200 families were to return to their homes in Sinwam, Shamiri, Mirali and Bubali areas of NWA. Each family was given as cash assistance and as transportation expenses at Mirzail. Food ration for six months and non-food items would also be given to each household. For effective disease control, children under five years of age were administered anti-polio vaccines and under 10 years of age were administered anti-measles vaccines. As of 4 May 2015, only 230 displaced families had returned since the launch of the repatriation programme. \\"The civil administration can send entire displaced population back to their homes within a month if the area is de- notified as conflict zone,\\" said an official dealing with IDPs repatriation. According to the official sources, the cut-off date for the return of IDPs was December 2016. Reaction =Domestic= Social media The decision by the Pakistani military to launch a comprehensive operation was widely supported, with journalists, opinion-makers, politicians and other social- media users commending the operation. Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf 22px - PTI chairman Imran Khan endorsed the military operation in North Waziristan as it became clear that the Taliban were not seriously negotiating. A week before, reiterating his party's stance on peace talks with militants, Imran said that an offensive in North Waziristan would unite militant forces against the Pakistani state. \\"Conducting such a military operation when most of the groups in NWA want talks is suicidal,\\" Imran said in a statement, adding that most groups in North Waziristan desired peace talks with the government. The PTI position changed as it became clear that negotiations were fruitless. Jamat-e-Islami 22px - Jamat-e-Islami (JI), one of Pakistan's leading religious parties, continued to oppose any operation in North Waziristan. JI leader Siraj-ul-Haq urged the government to keep the option of negotiations with the Taliban. He warned that a military operation in North Waziristan would trigger a massive human tragedy, saying that it was the duty of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to consider the views of the nation and its leadership (inside and outside Parliament) before making a crucial decision affecting national security. Muttahida Qaumi Movement 22px - According to Muttahida Qaumi Movement senator Babar Khan Ghauri, \\"This is a commendable decision by the government. We have been repeatedly telling the current government that instead of engaging the terrorists in dialogue, government should act against these elements. Karachi has a number of terrorists and it might suffer from a blow back; this should be tackled so Karachi does not have to suffer on account of this.\\" MQM head Altaf Hussain said, \\"I welcome this operation and I am glad that government is supporting the armed forces, those who have not backed the operation must realize that it is a matter of national security. I appeal to them to come on same page by setting aside their political compulsions.\\" he said. Awami National Party 22px - Awami National Party (ANP) member Zahid Khan said, \\"We also held a dialogue previously (during our government) but that did not produce effective results. We wanted peace and we were okay if that came through dialogue but unfortunately that could not happen. This time, knowing from our experience, we had cautioned the government that [the] dialogue approach would not work.

The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years, and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014. Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan: \\"The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat, and they continue to go after that threat.\\" On 5 November 2014, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, a senior commander for US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, said in a Pentagon-hosted video briefing from Afghanistan that the Haqqani network is now \\"fractured\\" like the Taliban. \\"They are fractured. They are fractured like the Taliban is. That's based pretty much on the Pakistan's operations in North Waziristan this entire summer-fall,\\" he said, acknowledging the effectiveness of Pakistan's military offensive. \\"That has very much disrupted their efforts in Afghanistan and has caused them to be less effective in terms of their ability to pull off an attack in Kabul,\\" Anderson added. * ‚Äì Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that terrorism was a problem common to China and Pakistan, since militants were the enemy of both countries, adding that China fully supported the operation. * ‚Äì Chairman of the State Duma Sergey Naryshkin commended the operation, while the Pakistani Army Chief, General Raheel Sharif was on an official visit to Russia. \\"We will stand by Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and extremism for stability in the region. Our relations are independent, more consistent and will further grow,\\" he added.

It is the senior award of a set of two decorations for bravery, along with the Distinguished Gallantry Medal. Bophuthatswana's military decorations and medals were modelled on those of the Republic of South Africa and these two decorations are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the Louw Wepener Decoration and Louw Wepener Medal.

Only one cross was ever awarded, to General Jack Turner, for his heroic action and who was shot in the ankle, whiles over powering and disarming a rebel guard, saving President Mangope's live and other captured officials from being executed during the attempted coup, on 10 February 1988.

These occurred in April 1996, when decorations and medals were belatedly instituted for the two former non-statutory forces, the Azanian People's Liberation Army and Umkhonto we Sizwe, and upon the institution of a new set of honours on 27 April 2003.

The Ministry of External Affairs, headed by External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, is responsible for executing the foreign policy of India. Modi's foreign policy is focused on improving relations with neighboring countries in South Asia, engaging the extended neighbourhood of Southeast Asia and the major global powers. In pursuit of this, he has made official visits to Bhutan, Nepal, and Japan within the first 100 days of his government, followed by visits to the United States, Myanmar, Australia, and Fiji. Background In his former role as Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi made several foreign trips to foster business relations with major Asian economic powers. This included meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007 and 2012, which reportedly built personal rapport. He also reached out for investment deals with China and Israel, who sought to increase economic ties beyond defense and agriculture, according to Israeli Ambassador Alon Ushpiz. Modi was widely appreciated for his endeavor to organize Vibrant Gujarat, a biannual international business summit, which welcomed investment in his home state and helped build a pro-development and business friendly image. 2014 general election In 2014 Modi did not make any major foreign policy speeches during the general election campaign, but he called out China's potential aggression along the border with India. He also focused on \\"illegal immigration\\" from Bangladesh, particularly during the later part of his campaign in the Eastern States, including Assam and West Bengal, and asserted that Hindus outside the country would be able to seek asylum in India if they required it. He acknowledged the fact that he was going to be the first Prime Minister of India to be born after independence and that it would be natural to expect a shift in world view from his predecessors'. He also pledged to have a \\"strong\\" foreign policy, which includes trading with China. He asked the External Affairs Ministry to focus more on trade deals than other geopolitical initiatives. Modi's first foreign policy outlook was revealed during the run-up for the Prime Ministerial candidate in his party in 2013 when he was in a Network 18 program called Think India, dialogue forum. He mentioned the following points: * Improving relations with immediate neighbors would be his priority as peace and tranquillity in South Asia were essential in order to realize his development agenda. * He pledged to introduce the concept of paradiplomacy in India where each state and city would have the liberty to forge special relations with countries, federal states, or cities of their interest. * Bilateral trade would dominate relations with most countries except for a few important global powers with which India shares a strategic partnership. Modi responded to the congratulatory messages and phone calls from most world leaders that he had received in the aftermath of his victory. =Inauguration= Before Modi formally took office as prime minister, he invited all heads of state and heads of government of India's neighbors to his inauguration and downplayed his former reputation as a hardliner. Almost all of the SAARC leaders attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony, along with Navin Ramgoolam of Mauritius, who held observer status at the event. The guest list included Afghanistan's Hamid Karzai, Bhutan's Tshering Tobgay, the Maldives' Abdulla Yameen, Nepal's Sushil Koirala, Pakistan's Nawaz Sharif, Sri Lanka's Mahinda Rajapaksa, and Mauritius' Navin Ramgoolam. As Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was travelling, parliamentary Speaker Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury came instead. Lobsang Sangay, the Prime Minister of Central Tibetan Administration, also attended. International media reacted positively to the ceremony after being critical of Modi's foreign policy. ;Approach of P5 nations Soon after the new government formed, world leaders expressed their willingness to work with the Modi Government to strengthen their relations with India as it would provide them with a bigger market. All five permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council sent their envoys to India within the first 100 days after inauguration, which is significant given India's long-standing bid to get a permanent membership at UNSC. * China sent its envoy to India first after the Modi government came into power, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited New Delhi on 8 June, held bilateral talks with his counterpart, and met with Modi. China indicated a willingness to reach a final settlement over their contested borders. * Russian Deputy chairman Dmitry Rogozin visited India on 18‚Äì19 June 2014 to reach out to the new government led by Modi. Where the two sides discussed the cooperation in joint defense production which was one of Modi's top agendas. Modi met with President Vladimir Putin in July on the sidelines of 6th BRICS summit in Brazil. * French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius made an official visit to India from 29 June2 July and held high-level talks with both the External Affairs Minister and Modi. Strategic and defense cooperation was at the top of his agenda and he expressed his hopes of a quick completion of the Dassault Rafale Jet deal as part of the delayed Indian MMRCA project under the new government. * British Foreign Secretary William Hague visited India on 7‚Äì8 July. During his meeting with Modi, he lobbied for the Eurofighter Typhoon to be considered instead of the Dassault Rafale for purchase. * Prior to his India trip, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry emphasized the importance of US-India relations in the twenty-first century and quoted the Hindi slogan from Modi's campaign \\"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas\\" (meaning \\"everyone's support, everyone's development\\") and said America shared this goal and was willing to work in full cooperation with the new government to realize it. He arrived in New Delhi on 1 August and held bilateral talks with his Indian counterpart to prepare the groundwork for Modi's USA visit and also lobbied to gain India's support for sanctions on Russia amidst the 2014 Ukraine crisis. In regards to the appeal, Swaraj said: \\"There is no change in our policy. We think that foreign policy is in continuity. Foreign policy does not change with the change in the government.\\" Foreign policy team Sushma Swaraj, one of the senior leaders of BJP, was given the portfolio of External Affairs which was going to be a very important ministry with India's growing role in international affairs. She was the first woman to hold the office. Earlier on her capacity of leader of opposition in Lok Sabha from 2009 to 2014 She met a galaxy of visiting foreign leaders which apparently helped her understand foreign relations. Modi appointed Ajit Doval, a seasoned intelligence officer, as National Security Advisor (NSA). Ajit Doval is believed to be close to the RSS, an organization Modi comes from. On 28 January 2015, only a day after the US President Barack Obama's successful India visit, the Modi government sacked Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh and appointed Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in her place, Jaishankar used to be as India's ambassador to the United States. Modi himself was believed to be unhappy over Singh's ability to lead the foreign office and on the other hand impressed by Jaishankar's diplomatic skills in turning the flagging relationship with the US into a flourishing partnership. His secondary aides also include Arvind Gupta(deputy NSA) and MJ Akbar(sworn in as the Minister of State for External Affairs). Policy initiative Former National Security Adviser & Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon, an academic at Brookings, opined that the Modi Government's foreign policy is one of \\"strategic incoherence\\", executed without an \\"overarching conceptual framework\\".Ravi Kumar Pillai Kandamath in the Journal of the Royal Society for Asian Affairs. See Ravi Kumar Pillai Kandamath (2018) Shivshankar Menon. Choices: Inside the Making of India‚Äôs Foreign Policy, Asian Affairs, 49:1, 151‚Äì154, DOI: 10.1080/03068374.2018.1416024 There have been many policy initiatives since that has been making the headlines: =Act East policy= From the very beginning the Modi led government made it amply clear that India would focus more and more on improving relations with ASEAN, and other East Asian countries as per India's Look East policy which was formulated during PM Narasimha Rao's government in 1992 for better economic engagement with its eastern neighbours but the successive government later successfully turned it into a tool for forging strategic partnership and security cooperation with countries in that region in general and Vietnam and Japan in particular. In her recent visit to Hanoi, Vietnam Sushma Swaraj has stressed on the need for an \\"Act East Policy\\" that she said should replace India's over two-decade-old \\"Look East Policy\\" emphasizing a more proactive role for India in this region. =Neighbourhood first policy= One of the major policy initiatives taken by the Modi government is to focus back on its immediate neighbors in South Asia. Gujral doctrine was an important approach where India made its relation with its neighborhood which stands on five important principles. Even before becoming the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbours which is being termed \\"neighborhood first: policy in the media\\" and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on the office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a mini SAARC summit by the media. Later during a launch event at ISRO, he asked Indian scientists to take the endeavour to develop a dedicated SAARC satellite to share the fruits of the technology like tele-medicine, e-learning, etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme program in the region. =Indian Ocean outreach= The Indian Ocean region (IOR), which has long been considered as India's nautical backyard, is steadily turning into a hotspot thanks to growing Chinese strategic presence over the region's numerous strategically located archipelagos. To counter the recent moves made by China in the name of President Xi's pet Maritime Silk Road project, India started to reach out its maritime neighbors in the IOR with proposals of enhanced economic and security cooperation. The policy towards IOR started to unfold during Sri Lankan president's visit to New Delhi in early February 2015. Following that Modi embarked on a three nations Yatraa (travel) to Mauritius, Seychelles and Sri Lanka, although Maldives was also initially part of this outreach, the recent political turmoil in that country led to the last-minute cancellation of the scheduled visit. Ahead of Modi's scheduled visit to Beijing in May 2015, India wanted to project that it commanded a strategic supremacy over the IOR and that its relations with its maritime neighbors were far more cordial than that of China's with particular reference to South China sea. =Project Mausam= On the back of growing Chinese naval activity in the Indian Ocean region, which India considers its area of responsibility, the Modi administration has introduced Project Mausam, which is believed to rival the Chinese Maritime Silk Road (MSR) initiative. Mausam (Hindi: ‡§Æ‡•å‡§∏‡§Æ) which means weather or season in many South and Southeast Asian languages is highlighted because of its profound role in cultural exchanges in the region as in ancient time maritime trade used to depend on seasonal monsoon winds. The project, which is still in the evolving phase, is being planned with the Cultural Ministry, that will focus on the ancient trade and cultural linkages with emphasize on future maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region stretching from Southeast Asia to East Africa with the central location of India, from where the ocean derived its name. =Cooperation with Pacific Islands= Modi chose to visit Fiji soon after democracy was re-established in the island country after 8 years. There apart from the bilateral meeting, he also met heads of state/government from 14 pacific island states to enhance India's engagement in the region and proposed a 'Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation' (FIPIC) be held on a regular basis. He conveyed there India's keenness to work closely with Pacific Island nations to advance their development priorities. In this regard a number of measures to strengthen India's partnership in the region were proposed that includes setting up of a 'special fund of $1 billion' for adapting climate change vis-a-vis clean energy, establishing a 'trade office' in India, 'Pan Pacific Islands e-network' to close the physical distance between the islands by improving digital connectivity, extending visa on arrival at Indian airports for all the fourteen Pacific Island countries, 'space cooperation' in space technology applications for improving the quality of life on the islands, 'training to diplomats' from Pacific Island countries to increase mutual understanding. He also expressed his willingness to host the leaders in any of India's coastal town for the next summit in 2015. It was quite significant to see Chinese President Xi following Modi's trail visited Fiji on 21 November (just 2 days after Modi's trip) to meet a similar gathering of leaders indicating a struggle for influence between the two Asian giants in the island countries of south pacific. =Fast-track Diplomacy= On completion of the first 100 days of Modi government, the External Affairs Ministry published a booklet called \\"Fast Track Diplomacy\\" show-casing the achievement made in the foreign policy arena. In her first media interaction, the minister Sushma Swaraj said the catchphrase for her tenure was \\"fast-track diplomacy\\" and said it had three faces ‚Äì proactive, strong and sensitive. Since taking office the External Affairs Minister held a round-table meeting with all Indian heads of missions to the SAARC region, ASEAN region and the Middle East separately as a follow-up measure to carry forward the leads gained by high-profile visits and exchanges. =Para Diplomacy= One of the innovative ideas of Modi government is the introduction of elements of paradiplomacy in India's foreign policy where each state and cities would be encouraged to forge special relation with countries or federal states of another country or even cities of their interest. During the upcoming visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Town twinning agreement between Mumbai and Shanghai, Ahmedabad and Guangzhou and a similar 'sister states' agreement between Gujarat and Guangdong of China will likely to be signed. Earlier Varanasi signed a partnership agreement with Kyoto, Japan. East Asia policy From the very beginning, the Modi led government made it amply clear that India would focus more and more on improving relation with ASEAN and other East Asian countries as per India's Look East policy which was formulated during Narasimha Rao's government in 1992 for better economic engagement with its eastern neighbors, but the successive government later successfully turned it into a tool for forging strategic partnership and security cooperation with countries in that region in general and Vietnam and Japan in particular. In her recent visit to Hanoi, Vietnam Sushma Swaraj has stressed on the need for an Act East policy that she said should replace India's over two-decade-old Look East Policy emphasizing a more proactive role for India in this region. East Asia being the major focus area of his foreign policy, Modi and his foreign minister chose several Asian countries for their initial bilateral visits. He has made state visits to Bhutan and Nepal and Japan within the first 100 days of his government followed by visits of Myanmar and Australia and also hosted Asia leaders like Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng apart from inviting SAARC leaders in his inauguration ceremony. External Affairs Minister Swaraj has also made official visits to several Asian capitals like Dhaka, Bangladesh, Kathmandu, Nepal, Naypidaw, Myanmar, Singapore, Hanoi, Vietnam, Manama, Bahrain, Kabul, Afghanistan, Dushanbe, Tajikistan, Male, Maldives, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Seoul, South Korea and Beijing, China. =South China Sea disputes= Though India's exclusive economic zone does not extend into the South China Sea, the region is geopolitically important to India as a high volume of its trade passes through the South China Sea. Modi intends India to act as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific Region as a part of Modi's underlying Act East foreign policy initiative . South Asia policy Even before becoming the Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbors which is being termed as \\"neighborhood first\\" policy in the media and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on the office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a mini SAARC summit by the media. Later during a launch event at ISRO, he has asked Indian scientists to take the endeavor to develop a dedicated SAARC satellite, to share the fruits of the technology like tele-medicine, e-learning etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme program in the region. West Asia policy Indian External Affairs Ministry refers to the region of 'Middle East' as West Asia and not as the Middle East which is a more popular attribution, particularly in the western countries. The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two-thirds of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad. =Link West policy= In an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the gulf countries, Modi proposed this policy to complement his Act East policy concerning East Asia. Although it is called 'Link West' (West of India) which gives it a bigger geographical connotation, it is most likely to focus on the middle-east and some of India's strategic thinkers are calling it as Modi's middle-east policy. The West Asia Approach of India is working successfully and its relations with the Middle East are improving since Modi came in power. The \\"West Asia Approach\\" of India is now its key strategy to win the Middle East. Indian foreign policy makers say that India's interests in the GCC countries are intimately linked with its energy security, trade, employment for Indians and remittances while Middle Eastern foreign policy experts believe that India has showcased itself as \\"Security Partner\\" during Modi's visit to UAE. Given the economic and human security interests, the stability and security of the GCC countries is crucial for India because a huge flow of remittances comes from GCC to the Indian economy. =Stand against ISIS= On 16 December 2014, Home Minister Rajnath Singh announced in the Parliament that ISIS is banned as a terrorist organization under the United Nations schedule. Following the arrest of few Indian individuals with ISIS connections, on 26 February 2015, India put fresh bans on 'The Islamic States/Islamic States of Iraq and Syria/Islamic States of Iraq and Levant' with all its manifestation and all its affiliates under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. =2014 Israel- Hamas conflict= At the height of the tension between Israel and Hamas in July, India offered a rhetorical condemnation holding both sides responsible for erupting violence and asked Israel to stop \\"disproportionate use of force\\" in Gaza which was read by many as departure from tradition of more vocal supports for the Palestinian cause. External Affairs Minister Swaraj insisted that \\"there is absolutely no change in India's policy towards Palestine, which is that we fully support the Palestinian cause while maintaining good relations with Israel. \\" clarifying India's current position on the issue. That might sound like fence-sitting, but it is a policy shared by all Indian governments of the past 20 years following the establishment of formal diplomatic relation in 1992. Sushma Swaraj, a seasoned parliamentarian, had herself blocked the opposition demand in Rajya Sabha for passing a resolution condemning Israel for 2014 Israel-Gaza conflict by saying that \\"India has friendly relation with both Israel and Palestine and therefore any such move may impact its friendship negatively\\". Although later in a symbolic gesture, India joined other BRICS nations in voting at the United Nations Human Rights Council for a probe into the alleged human rights violation in Gaza which generated mixed response among media and analysts in India. =Overseas Indian crisis= ;Iraq With the rise of ISIS in northern Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of Indian migrant workers live, the security of those overseas Indians came under threat. On 16 June, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) set up a 24-hour helpline at the Indian embassy in Baghdad for the assistance of Indian nationals stranded in the conflict cities. It has been reported that 46 Indian nurses were abducted from the Iraqi town of Mosul who were later freed and flown back to India. Moreover, 39 Indian workers mainly from Punjab were taken hostages and the fate of those workers still not known. There were widespread speculations about their lives and on 27 November 2014 ABP News reported, citing Bangladeshi migrant co-workers, death of all the 39 men. Although the following day, External Affairs Minister (EAM) Swaraj made a statement to the parliament neither rejecting nor confirming such possibility and re-assured the nation about MEA's commitment for continuing search for the Indians in Iraq. ;Libya A similar situation occurred in Libya where many Indian nationals are stranded because of the armed conflict that broke in Benghazi and other parts of the country. Swaraj informed the parliament that her ministry was evaluating all possibilities to secure the safe evacuation of all Indians stranded in both Iraq and Libya. A chartered flight from Djerba, Tunisia brought over 200 nationals back to India. A further 216 nationals left on 8 August, with a total of another 1,500 nationals having been evacuated. About 3,000 more nationals registered with the embassy in Tripoli to return. On 5 August 44 nurses returned to India on a special Air India flight; they were predominantly from Kerala with some from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. A further three Goans were reported to be safe in Libya with full employment and had not requested repatriation. Goa's Director of NRI Affairs U. D. Kamat said that it was ascertaining whether there were Goan workers in the country. ;Yemen After the outbreak of aerial attacks by the Saudi led coalition following the coup by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Government of India launched a massive rescue operation called Operation Raahat (meaning: Relief) to save hundreds of non-residential Indians located there. Minister of State for External Affairs General V K Singh himself oversaw the entire rescue operation right from the battle ground towns of Sana'a and Aden in Yemen and the Indian base of operation in Djibouti. In the process, the Indian Navy deployed its front line ships such as , INS Sumitra and others while the Indian Air Force too deployed its C-17 Globemaster tactical airlifter to airlift the stranded Indians and the national carrier Air India also took an active part by ferrying passengers. The operation was highly successful and received huge acclamation from across the globe as it rescued not only Indians but thousands of foreigners stranded in the war torn country too. Relations with North and South America =United States= Trump with Modi at the G20 Hamburg summit in July 2017. During the run-up to the general election there was wide- ranging scepticism regarding future of the strategic bilateral relation under Modi's premiership as in 2005 he was, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, denied a U.S. visa during the Bush administration for his alleged poor human rights records. However sensing Modi's inevitable victory well before the election, the US Ambassador Nancy Powell had reached out to him as part of greater re- approachment from the west. Moreover, following his 2014 election as the Prime Minister of India President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited him to visit the US. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visited New Delhi on 1 August to prepare the grounds for Modi's first ever US visit as Prime Minister. In September 2014, days before visiting the US in an interview to CNN‚Äôs Fareed Zakaria, Modi said that \\"India and the United States are bound together, by history and culture\\" but acknowledged that there have been \\"ups and downs\\" in relations. Modi travelled to US from 27‚Äì30 September 2014, beginning with his maiden address in the United Nations general assembly followed by attending a gala public reception by the Indian American community in New York's Madison Square Garden before heading Washington, D.C. for the bilateral talk with Obama. While there, Modi also met several American business leaders and invited them to join his ambitious Make in India program in a bid to make India a manufacturing hub. Later President Obama greeted Modi by calling him a \\"Man of Action\\" during their brief interaction at the Gala dinner hosted by Myanmar's President on the eve of ninth East Asia Summit this was their second meeting since Obama hosted a rare dinner for Modi at the White House on 29 September 2014. On 9 December 2014 US Senate confirmed Richard Rahul Verma as the US Ambassador to India, the first Indian American to hold the office, signalling the Obama administration's will to elevate the relation with India to a newer height. He assumed office in the US Embassy in New Delhi on 19 December 2014. Modi invited President Obama to be the first US President to grace the 66th Republic Day celebration as Chief guest, an honour typically reserved for India's closest ally. President Obama was the first US President to visit India twice in office and the two leaders now scheduled to hold back to back summits within six months which is being referred as Modi's diplomatic coup by the media. \\"This Republic Day, we hope to have a friend over‚Ä¶ invited President Obama to be the 1st US president to grace the occasion as chief guest.\\"- Modi tweeted. On 26 June 2017, Modi met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, DC where they discussed trade, specifically airplanes and natural gas, and terrorism.Office of the Press Secretary. Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Modi of India in Joint Press Statement, The White House, Washington, DC, 26 June 2017. Retrieved 27 June 2017. =Brazil= Narendra Modi met the Brazilian President, Dilma Rousseff on the sidelines of the 6th BRICS summit in Brasilia, Brazil, in July 2014. Describing Brazil as a key global partner for India, Modi noted that as two democracies and major emerging economies, India and Brazil not only had vast potential for bilateral cooperation, but also to strengthen each other in international forums and advance the interest of the developing world at large. President Rousseff emphasized the special place this relationship enjoyed in Brazil's foreign policy, because of the potential for bilateral cooperation and the international significance of their partnership. She congratulated Narendra Modi for his victory in the elections and wished him all success for India's progress and development. The two leaders also agreed to take steps to further expand and diversify trade and investment flows and deepen cooperation in agriculture and dairy science, conventional and renewable energy, space research and applications, defence, cyber security and environment conservation. More recently, in January 2020, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro made his first official visit to Modi's India. Considered as a particularly warm welcome by the visiting delegation ‚Äî therefore kept in high regard since then ‚Äî, the reception helped Bolsonaro's chancellery gain some traction overseas, overcoming a persisting trend of Brazilian international isolation started with the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires. Later in the same year, in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic, both governments launched cooperation programs aimed at addressing the ongoing health and sanitary crisis. =Canada= In April 2015 Modi visited Canada and was the first bilateral visit to that country by an Indian Prime Minister in 42 years. India made a nuclear deal with the Canada's biggest producer of uranium, Cameco, signed a $280 million, five-year deal to supply uranium to fuel Indian nuclear reactors. The long-term deal announced later that Cameco will sell 7.1 million pounds of uranium to India, through 2020. Modi held bilateral talks with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, and signed various MoUs like in areas of cybersecurity, skill development, cooperation in the railways and civil aviation front. Modi received \\"rockstar\\" reception in Canada where he addressed a crowd of over 10,000 at the Ricoh Coliseum Stage in Toronto. Relations with European Nations =France= France is a valuable strategic partner of India in western Europe. Both countries have invested political capital to deepen collaboration in the cultural, economic, social, technological and military realms. Modi met French President Francois Hollande at the 2014 G-20 Summit in Brisbane, and discussed bilateral strategic, space and defence issues besides committing to global cooperation against terrorism. Following the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo terror attack in Paris, Modi condemned the act of terror and called Hollande to convey condolences on behalf of the people of India as well as express solidarity with the people of France. French foreign minister Laurent Fabius made several visits to New Delhi to unlock stalled negotiations regarding Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft for Indian Air Force and the 9900 MW nuclear power plant in Jaitapur by the French firm Areva. In April 2015, Modi choose Paris as his first destination in Europe as part of his Link West outreach. Modi's visit resulted in a government-to-government deal for 36 Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft in fly-away condition. India and France signed an initial agreement between Nuclear Power Corporation of India and Areva regarding the setting up of Jaitapur nuclear power plant. Modi toured the aircraft assembly facilities of Dassault Aviation in Bordeaux and Airbus in Toulouse where he promoted the Make in India campaign by urging the aerospace giants to cultivate manufacturing opportunities in India (Airbus committed to increase its outsourcing from India from the current level of US$400 million to US$2 billion by 2020). Modi travelled to Lille in the north of France to pay hommage at Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial dedicated to the remembrance of 4742 soldiers of the British Indian Army who died during World War I & II. On 30 November 2015, Indian Prime-Minister Narendra Modi travelled to France for a 2-day visit to attend the COP 21 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Narendra Modi and Fran√ßois Hollande jointly invited over 100 world leaders to join InSPA (International Agency for Solar Policy & Application) ‚Äì a global initiative to promote low-carbon renewable solar energy technologies. When the Climate Change Treaty itself was under threat with President Trump announcing the withdrawal of USA -one of the major polluters as such, USA did become a part of the International Solar Alliance and lauded the efforts of the Indian leader. India invited French President Francois Hollande to be the chief guest at the Republic Day parade in New Delhi on 26 January 2016. The invitation was conveyed through the visiting French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, making France the only country to be invited a record setting 5 times to the highly symbolic national ceremonial event. =United Kingdom= UK Prime Minister David Cameron was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Modi soon after his landslide victory in the election. The two leaders met for the first time on 14 November 2014 on the sidelines of the G20 leaders' summit in Brisbane, where the British Prime Minister said improving relations with India was the \\"top priority\\" of UK foreign policy. He also invited Modi to visit his country at the earliest. Earlier Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg attributed the growth story of South Asia, which was going to grow fastest in 2014‚Äì15 outside the East Asia region, to the election of Prime Minister Modi and his recent efforts to turn around the economy. UK hailed Modi's Make in India policy and is all set to invest in Rajasthan. Modi paid a state visit to the UK in late 2015, meeting Queen Elizabeth II and prime minister David Cameron. On 13 November 2015 Modi addressed a rally at the new Wembley Stadium at Wembley Park, north-west London. 60,000 people, mostly British Indians, attended. =Germany= In April 2015 Modi visited Germany where he held bilateral talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Modi also inaugurated Hannover Fair 2015-world's largest industrial fair, where India was the partner country. Modi made the strongest pitch for the Make in India initiative in Hannover fair. He said, \\"The entire world is looking at India. Demography, democracy and demand are attracting the world to India.\\" There were announcements of strengthened cooperation in sectors like energy, skill development, science & technology, and the Modi government's initiatives like Digital India and Clean India. Relations with Eurasia =Russia= Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands in New Delhi in 2014 Russia, India's long term strategically for more than half a century, enjoys a special privileged strategic cooperation unparalleled in India's foreign relations. But over the years especially after their end of the cold war, the relation experienced strain as India started diversifying its defence purchases from a totally Soviet-dominated one. But with Putin and Modi, both with strongman image at their home country, at the helm of affairs in their respective foreign policy, it is expected to get a push. During the 20th 'India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation' (IRIGC-TEC) held on 5 November 2014 in New Delhi Modi met the Russian deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin and had reassured the visiting side that the new dispensation in New Delhi will continue to attach very high importance to the time-tested and special strategic partnership with Russia. The annual commission meeting had identified new areas of cooperation including prioritising the International North-South Corridor Project (INSTC), start negotiating on a Free Trade Agreement between India and the Eurasian customs union, focusing on enhancing economic partnership in areas like energy, civil aviation and diamond trade along with Russian participation in Modi's smart city project. Earlier on his first meeting with Putin, emphasising Russia's indispensable position in India's foreign policy Modi went on to say that even a child in India considers Russia as its best friend. This meeting in Brazil at the sidelines of BRICS summit served well as the familiarisation between the two leaders. President Putin visited New Delhi on 11 December 2014 for the annual summit, first after Modi assumed office. Trade and energy cooperation dominated the talks as they set a target of US$30 billion of bilateral trade by 2025 with an equal amount of investment in each other's economy. On the backdrop of increasing western sanctions Putin earlier signed a gas deal with China worth US$400 billion believed to be heavily tilted in China's favour. India too was keen to strike an energy agreement on line of above. During the summit, both sides agreed for a joint feasibility study of building a gas pipeline through China. The two sides signed a total of 16 agreements and memorandum of understanding on various fields. Agreements on long term oil and gas cooperation have been signed between ONGC Videsh and Essar Oil of India and Russia's Rosneft, Gasprom Putin also vowed to install 10 more nuclear reactors in next 20 years including adding more units to Kudankulam plant. Another burgeoning aspect in bilateral relations emerged in the form of Diamond trading, While Russia is the largest producer of raw diamond, India is the global hub of cutting and polishing raw diamonds. Russia has agreed to export raw diamonds to India directly bypassing mediators like Dubai and Belgium. On this occasion, the two leaders also attended a World Diamond Conference held in New Delhi. The Crimean leader Sergey Aksyonov, who accompanied Putin in New Delhi, met several business delegations to discuss the opportunity in the Black sea region although it was termed as unofficial. This has once again raised concerns in Washington, D.C. regarding India's stand on Crimea. Defence ties In the summit, Modi mentioned his experience with the Russian built carrier INS Vikramaditya as an example of burgeoning military cooperation and remarked that \\"even though India's options have increased, Russia will continue to remain its topmost defence partner\\" signalling a long term defence relation. The two sides agreed on joint production of Mil Mi-17 and Kamov Ka-226 helicopters with Russian technology in India in compliance with Modi's Make in India program and also fast forwarding the long pending major projects like the joint development and production of light transport aircraft. The final design contract of fifth generation joint fighter platform Sukhoi-HAL FGFA is expected to be signed soon as it already lagging by more than 2 years. India is set to lease a second nuclear powered Akula-class submarine from Russia after INS Chakra (2011) which is already in service. Weeks before Putin's visit news of Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu's Pakistan visit on 20 November 2014, first such visit in more than 40 years, when the two sides inked a defence cooperation pact. Media reports suggested that Russia was mulling a possible sale of Mi 35 attack copter, the first ever combat platform, to India's arch rival Pakistan. These developments have raised concerns in the Indian strategic community as some see this as a counter move to growing Indo-US defence collaboration. Although the official response was much restrained as they termed it 'significant'. Such apprehensions in India about Russia's strategic goals in the region was by the Russian Ambassador Kaladin as he said that it will not do anything detrimental to India's security. Later Putin himself in an interview with India's PTI news agency said that 'Russia-Pakistan ties in India's long-term interest'. Relations with Africa =India-Africa Forum Summit= The third summit in a rotation basis was scheduled to be held in New Delhi, India in December 2014. But lately, Syed Akbaruddin, the official spokesperson of Indian Foreign Ministry told the media that the scheduled summit is now postponed to 2015 and will include more no. of African leaders, unlike previous two occasions where the event was restricted to only 10‚Äì15 African countries. Although media reports claimed that the Ebola outbreak in Western African nations played a key role behind the postponement of the summit. The summit is now rescheduled on 26‚Äì30 October 2015. =Mauritius= Mauritius was the only country outside South Asia whose head of government attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. With people of Indian origin constituting a large share of its population Mauritius has very good bilateral relations with New Delhi. Swaraj made her maiden trip as foreign minister to the island country on 2 November 2014 to attend the celebration of Apravasi Divas, marking 180 years since the first Indian indentured labourers arrived in Mauritius. There she had called on President Rajkeswur Purryag and Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam to discuss bilateral and regional issues of common interest. On top of her agenda was talk on cooperation between the Indian Navy and Mauritian Coast Guard to ensure the safety and security of the strategically vital Indian Ocean region. In support of her stress on the importance of maritime cooperation three major Indian war ships were docked in Mauritian waters including a destroyer , a frigate and the fleet tanker . Modi made his first state visit to the island country in March 2015 as part of his larger outreach to India's maritime neighbours in the Indian Ocean where he participated in the Mauritius National Day celebration in Port Louis on 12 March 2015. He was also present during the commissioning ceremony of MCGS Barracuda, the offshore patrol vessels (OPV) that Mauritius bought from Kolkata based GRSE shipyard. The ship was earlier handed over on 20 December 2014 which marked India's first warship export. Multilateral Engagements India, as one of leading developing countries, plays an active role in important multilateral forums for global governance such as United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20 leaders summit, East Asia Summit, BRICS summit of emerging economies, Commonwealth of Nations and often seen as a 'Third World voice'. Apart from these big platforms India also engaged in many regional groupings like the BASIC, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Indian Ocean Rim Association, IBSA Dialogue Forum, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, Mekong‚ÄìGanga Cooperation, BIMSTEC among others. =BRICS summit= Temer, Modi, Xi, Putin and Zuma. Modi in his maiden speech at the BRICS, a group of emerging economies comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, called for brotherhood among the member states citing Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, an ancient Indian concept meaning the entire world is one family, to unitedly face the global challenges. India together with its BRICS partner working toward the launching of a financial institute rivalling the western dominated World Bank and IMF which was first proposed during the New Delhi summit in 2012 by the then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. In the 6th BRICS summit held on 14‚Äì26 July in Fortaleza, Brazil the group have agreed to establish the bank with a corpus of US$100 billion. The bank would be named the New Development Bank as suggested by the Indian side but Modi government has failed to bag the bank's headquarter for New Delhi which would be located in Shanghai, China. * Later at an event in Brasilia BRICS leaders met the UNASUR heads of state/heads of government. At the same time, the Ministry of External Affairs added Spanish to its list of available languages, which the Hindustan Times read as \\"indicative of the government's intent to go beyond Europe, Asia and the US to forge diplomatic and trade ties with Latin American nations.\\" He travelled there via Germany. =Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit= India is now a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is known to be a China-backed bloc for military and energy cooperation. It held observer status from 2005 and publicly expressed its wish for a full membership. India and Pakistan joined SCO as full members on 9 June 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan. Although Russia had all along backed India's entry it was Beijing's reservation which held it so long. However Chinese president Xi Jinping informed Modi during BRICS summit in Brazil that it is ready to welcome India together with Pakistan to project a united front against Islamic extremism in Central Asia including Afghanistan especially after NATO withdrawal. On 11‚Äì12 September EAM Sushma Swaraj attended the Dushanbe summit in Tajikistan where India formally put its paper for a full membership and it became likely that it would be granted so according to Chinese officials. Modi participated at the heads of government summit in Astana, Kazakhstan in December. =United Nations general assembly= Modi delivered his maiden speech in the sixty-ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September 2014, where he called for reform and expansion of United Nations Security Council including India's long-standing demand of a permanent membership. He expressed his concerns over the relevance of a 20th-century setup in the 21st century and the need to evaluate the UN's performance in the past 70 years. He had also argued why the UN should serve as \\"G-All\\" for global governance instead of several parallel sub-groupings like G7, G20, etc. In the wake of ISIS threat in West Asia and similar in other parts of the globe he urged for immediate implementation of 'Comprehensive on International Terrorism' by the UN and offered India's pro- active role in it citing India as a victim of terrorism for decades. Prior to his speech he along with External Affairs Minister Swaraj met UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and discussed UN governance relating issues. Ridiculing the possibility of any multilateral intervention, a demand Sharif has made in his address at the UNGA on 26 September, on Kashmir related matter he stated that his government is ready for 'bilateral talk' to Pakistan provided Pakistan should cultivate a suitable environment for talks by giving up terrorism policy against India. Modi commented briefly on climate change and use of clean energy, in this regards he also asked world leaders and UN officials for observing International Yoga Day, emphasizing the importance of incorporating Yoga in modern-day lifestyle. At the sidelines, he held bilateral meetings with Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Nepali Prime Minister Sushil Koirala taking his 'neighbourhood first' policy forward even in New York City. But there was no meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif following the recent low in the relation. Later he also met where Benjamin Netanyahu, in a first meeting in 11 years between the two heads of government, the Israeli Prime Minister who had highlighted the potential of the bilateral relation saying \\"sky is the limit\\". =ASEAN-India summit= Association of South-East Asian Nations or ASEAN is the 10 member block, it is one of the most successful regional block in the world. India started looking toward the group seriously from 1992 with the launch of 'Look East policy' and now it occupies the central position in India's policy Southeast Asia. From 2002 onward India and ASEAN started holding an annual summit at the sidelined of ASEAN summit showing the growing level of engagement between the two sides. At the 12th India-ASEAN summit, which was Modi's first appearance in an ASEAN meet, he called for greater connectivity with the Southeast Asian countries and mentioned that \\"India and ASEAN can be 'great partners'\\". Stressing on the importance ASEAN commands in India's foreign policy Modi has repeatedly remarked that his government has in the last 6 months made relation with ASEAN a top priority and turned India's two-decade old 'Look East policy' into 'Act East policy' which reflects a renewed momentum in India's approach toward ASEAN nations. The two sides also discussed the scope of extending the existing free trade agreement on the service sector as well and ways to increase India-ASEAN trade which is expected to reach US$100 billion in 2015. Modi also stressed on three 'C's to strengthen the relation and those are commerce, connectivity and cultural links. In the sidelines of ASEAN summit Modi, also held several bilateral meetings with his counterparts including Thai Prime Minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and South Korean President Park Geun-hye. ;ASEAN Regional Forum Earlier Swaraj had attended the 2014 ASEAN Regional Forum followed by the related EAS Foreign Ministers meeting, held from 8‚Äì11 August in Naypidaw, Myanmar, which was her first ever appearance in multilateral forums after becoming India's foreign affairs head. At the sidelines of the multilateral meetings, she had also held bilateral meetings with her counterparts from seven countries including China, Australia, Canada, Vietnam, Philippines, Brunei and Indonesia. In regards to the controversy of territorial ownership in the South China Sea, a contentious issue impacting most ASEAN member states, where ONGC Videsh has an investment in oil blocks, MEA spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin said: \\"India is not a party to the dispute in the South China Sea. We feel that the dispute should be resolved between those who are party to it in a peaceful manner and it should be in accordance with international law\\". =East Asia summit= Modi (fifth from left) with national leaders at the 9th EAS in Nay Pyi Daw, Myanmar. East Asia Summit (EAS) which is an ASEAN led dialogue forum comprises 18 countries, 10 core ASEAN nations along with Japan, China, South Korea, India, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and the United States. Over the years EAS has become the most important multilateral body in the Asia Pacific region for discussing security, trade and commerce, environment and others, unlike APEC which is purely economic in nature. Modi participated in the ninth East Asia Summit in Nay Pyi Daw, Myanmar in November which was his second major multilateral even after BRICS in July. Describing the importance of the EAS in managing regional security, Modi mentioned \\"No other forum brings together such a large collective weight of global population, youth, economy and military strength. Nor is any other forum so critical for peace, stability and prosperity in Asia-Pacific and the world\\". With a veiled reference of the issue of South China Sea Modi has asked the global community for respecting maritime norms and regulations and stressed on the importance of maintaining free and secured sea-lines of communication for regular trade and commerce. He made a remark that \\"In a world of interdependence and globalisation, there is no option but to follow international laws and norms. This also applies to maritime security. For this reason, following international law and norms is important for peace and stability in the South China Sea as well\\". Modi also focused on the role of EAS member countries to tackle the menace of terrorism in the region. Modi also highlighted the re-opening of Nalanda University and the role of all EAS member states into it to showcase the joint effort of the block. Among others, the issue of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) was discussed in details during the summit. In the sidelines of EAS Modi also held several bilateral meetings with his counterparts including Russia Premier Dmitry Medvedev, The Philippines President Benigno Aquino, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Indonesian President Joko Widodo. =G-20 leaders summit= Modi (third from left) with national leaders at the 2014 G-20 summit. G20 or the Group of 20 leading economies (advanced and emerging markets) of the world formed after the 2008 financial crisis for international financial governance. India which ranks 5 in terms of nominal GDP and the fastest growing economy plays an important role in the group since it began in 2008. For the first time in 2014, India was represented by Prime Minister Modi unlike all the previous summits when Dr. Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist, used to be the Prime Minister. The host and President of 2014 summit Australia's Tony Abbott intended the summit to focus exclusively on revamping the crisis prone fragile economy and to add US$2 trillion in the global economy by additional 2% global GDP growth rate for the next five years but countries like the US was keener to discuss issues of Climate change and reduction of Carbon emission as it sealed a similar pact with China. India's interest was also aligned with Abbott as it wants to reboot its economy and return to the high growth trajectory soon. In Modi, a chaiwallah (roadside tea vendor) turned politician eventually became the Prime Minister of world's largest democracy winning the highest number of votes in the history, was the most sought after world leader at the G20 in Brisbane and The Guardian called Modi the G20's political rock star commenting on Modi's popularity in Brisbane. His personal rapport with host Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was something to watch out for. Abbott who was meeting Modi for the third time, after his New Delhi trip in September and in Nay Pyi Daw just 2 days back, extended a warm hug toward Modi while welcoming world leaders in the summit venue in Brisbane. This also generated in the Australian media circle as there was 'no hug' even for Abbott's long-time friend Cameron. Modi, on his longest trip of 10 days to three different countries, met leaders from 40 different countries and even his Australia trip didn't end at Brisbane thereafter he visited Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra what is being referred as his 'diplomatic juggernaut'. The issue of black or unaccounted money kept in tax havens (countries that allow foreigners to dump huge unaccounted money) abroad was also raised by Modi which is also a burning issue in India's domestic polity. He also stressed on the need of changing laws in certain countries to allow better information sharing of black money kept abroad as it is also linked to the terror funding. India the world's largest recipient of remittances with $71 billion sent last year, pushed hard for the reduction in the remittance costs of non-residents at the G20 summit, asking it to work on steps to reduce costs in sending money home from abroad which is as high as 10 per cent in some countries. Earlier India has been able to convince Saudi Arabia to reduce it to 3.5 per cent. G20 agreed to bring down the global average cost of transferring remittances to 5%. In the sidelines of G20 Modi also held several bilateral meetings with his counterparts including British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran√ßois Hollande, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy, Saudi Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and also attended a special dinner hosted by his friend Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan. Even before the G20 summit formally begins all five leaders of the BRICS grouping gathered in Brisbane for an informal meeting at the invitation of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to discuss issues concerning the group like the New Development Bank. =South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation= Relations with the immediate neighbours in South Asia, which have allegedly long been neglected by the previous governments, became a priority feature in Modi's foreign policy. He started well by inviting all the heads of states/governments of the neighbouring countries at his inauguration and then pushed for an early summit to encourage cooperation in many regional issues like trade, connectivity, infrastructure, transit facility among the member states. In his maiden SAARC summit in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu, he had focused on greater people to people contacts, better connectivity, commercial linkages within the region. China, which holds an observer status in the group, was represented by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin seen actively promoting a more active role for itself in the region including infrastructure funding through its proposed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and extending its ambitious Maritime Silk Road project to South Asian nations. Pakistan, China's all weather friend, also vouched for a more participatory role for the observer nations in the summit process, indirectly advocating for a more Chinese involvement. Although no such proposal was accepted because of India's reservation. India had earlier advanced three proposals to boost connectivity in the region and those were the 'Regulation of Passenger and Cargo Vehicular Traffic amongst SAARC Member States' for seamless vehicular movement beyond the national borders the 'SAARC Regional Agreement on Railways' for international rail service and the 'SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity)' for energy trade in the subcontinent which is often regarded as world's most energy-starved region. Pakistan which is the second largest economy in the block threatened to jeopardise the entire summit by not agreeing on any of the three proposed agreements. Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj had a brief interaction with Sartaj Aziz, Pakistan's foreign affairs advisor which was seen as a possible ice-breaker but later the Indian side termed it as ‚Äòcourtesy call‚Äô. The Nepalese delegation including Prime Minister Koirala, the summit host, tried hard to mediate between India and Pakistan to rescue the summit from total failure which led to a hand-shake between Modi and Sharif at the end. Finally, all the sides agreed to sign the 'SAARC Framework Agreement for Energy Cooperation (Electricity)' only as a face-saving measure for the Kathmandu summit. In the sidelines of the main summit, Modi also held bilateral meetings with leaders of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka with a notable exception of Pakistan due to ongoing stand-off between the two countries. =Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation= Although India is not a member of APEC, Chinese president Xi Jinping, the host of the 2014 APEC summit, invited Modi to attend the event in Beijing as a guest and also showed willingness to support India's bid to join APEC. India already enjoys such support from other member states such as Russia and Vietnam. However, Modi did not participate in the meeting as a host partner country on the line of Pakistan and Bangladesh on the account of busy diplomatic schedule and a likely state visit to China next year. =International Agency for Solar Technologies and Applications= PM Modi has brought together 120 countries to form a solar alliance named International Agency for Solar Technologies & Applications (INSTA). =Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC)= In November 2016, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their Summit Joint Statement reiterated the resolve of the two countries to \\"develop industrial corridors and industrial network for the growth of Asia and Africa.\\" India-Japan economic engagement with Africa, under the aegis of Asia Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC), is based on the premise that the direction of global economic activities is indeed shifting towards the Indo-Pacific region. AAGC seeks to provide an alternative model of development and partnership between developed and developing countries/region for mutual benefit incorporating interconnectivity, infrastructure development, and capacity building.

This instrument is considered to be a national instrument of Svaneti and is thought to have spread in the other regions of Georgia from there. Chuniri has different names in different regions: in Khevsureti, Tusheti (Eastern mountainous parts) its name is chuniri, and in Racha, Guria (western parts of Georgia) chianuri. Chuniri is used for accompaniment. It is often played in an ensemble with changi (harp) and salamuri (flute). Both men and women played it. Accompaniment of solo songs, national heroic poems and dance melodies were performed on it in Svaneti. Chuniri and Changi are often played together in an ensemble when performing polyphonic songs. More than one Chianuri at a time is not used. Chianuri is kept in a warm place. Often, especially in rainy days it was warmed in the sun or near fireplace before using, in order to emit more harmonious sounds. This fact is acknowledged in all regions where the fiddlestick instruments were spread. That is done generally because dampness and wind have a certain effect on the instrument's resonant body and the leather that covers it. In Svaneti and Racha people even could make a weather forecast according to the sound produced by chianuri. Weak and unclear sounds were the signs of a rainy weather. The instrument's side strings i.e. first and third strings are tuned in fourth, but the middle (second) string is tuned in third with the lowest string and second with the top string. It was a tradition to play Chuniri late in the evening the day before a funeral. For instance, one of the relatives (man) of a dead person would sit down in open air by the bonfire and play a sad melody. In his song (sang in a low voice) he would remember the life of the deceased person and the lives of ancestors of the family. Most of the songs performed on Chianuri are connected with sad occasions. There is an expression in Svaneti that \\"chuniri is for sorrow\\". However, it can be used at parties as well.

Designed by architect Frederick Ernst Ruffini in the Second Empire style, it opened in 1886. When the county seat was moved to Johnson City in 1890, the old courthouse was repurposed as an office building. For almost a decade beginning in 1893, it was used as classrooms for local students while a new schoolhouse was being built, and in again 1919 when the schoolhouse fell into disrepair. For the next half century, the building served multiple tenants, including banks, tax collectors, entertainment venues, a museum, a restaurant and the local newspaper. For 24 years, the old courthouse was the area hospital. It was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1972. It was purchased in 1986 by a private individual at Stonewall who planned to move it to his property. Local citizenry immediately responded by forming the Old Blanco County Courthouse Preservation Society to save the building, and by pressing the Blanco City Council to designate an Historical District ordinance to prevent the same fate from happening to other historic structures. The Society's initial effort of a bake sale raised a meager $750.00 to save the courthouse. The campaign eventually received nationwide press coverage, and garnered support and donations from high-profile individuals in Texas. Upon a successful outcome of their efforts, the old building underwent an exterior renovation. Texas Governor George W. Bush presided over the 1998 re-opening of the courthouse. Currently, the old courthouse is a multi-use building being leased to business tenants and rented out for special events. The Coen brothers filmed the building's interior for the 2010 film True Grit.

The started aim of the trust is the protection of wildlife, especially African elephants, and the reduction of the ivory trade. In June 2014, the Tsavo Trust came into the international spotlight when it announced the death of Kenya's iconic and most well-known elephant, Satao, killed by an ivory poacher with a poisoned arrow. The Tsavo ecosystem consists of or arid and semi arid land in southern Kenya. The national parks within this region are managed by Kenya Wildlife Service. Around the parks, but within the Tsavo ecosystem, are a number of small towns, villages, ranches, and farms. Contained in this system is the largest population of African elephants in Kenya, numbering 12,000 as of 2011. There are a number of critical issues in the Tsavo ecosystem which include: a high rate of poverty among the people in the region, poor access to education and healthcare, degradation of habitat, ethnic conflict over resources, loss of wildlife, and lack of financial and technical resources to deal with these issues. In this context, the stated mission of the Tsavo Trust is to (1) facilitate the development of community-based wildlife conservancies that mutually benefit both the wildlife and people of this region; (2) enhance wildlife conservation in support of the Kenya Wildlife Service and the community conservancies that they help to develop and thereby create more secure park boundaries to reduce poaching; (3) develop multimedia educational tools to increase public awareness of wildlife conservation issues; and (4) facilitate wildlife animal welfare.

It was unknown to local inhabitants until it was discovered and named by the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition when reconnoitring a route to climb the mountain.* Lhagba La is the starting point of the Kada Glacier which descends eastwards along the valley towards Kada. The Kada River is a tributary of the Arun River. On the western side of the col is the East Rongbuk Glacier which flows north from Everest. Lhagba Pool, below and to southwest, is reportedly the second highest lake in the world. Expeditions attempting Everest via the North Col generally arrive up the East Rongbuk Glacier and so do not reach Lhagba La at all. However, when George Mallory and Guy Bullock were trying to reach the North Col, the route from Rongbuk was unknown to them. Instead they approached from the east only to find the glacier did not extend to the North Col. The climbing team eventually had to cross the pass and descend some to the East Rongbuk Glacier before ascending to the North Col. Their discovery allowed the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition to take the more direct route from the north. The well known Yeti footprints were found in this region for the first time in the world probably at the beginning of 19th century. Later it came up into the light through the media.

The industry started during the late 1950s when the first ceramic industrial plants were established. The industry mainly produces tableware, sanitaryware and tiles. As of 2011, there were 21 ceramic industrial units throughout Bangladesh, employing about 500,000 people. In the first nine months of the 2013-14 fiscal year, Bangladesh exported about US$36 million worth of goods after meeting 80% of the domestic demand. The main export destinations are the EU, the US and the Middle- ast.  History  The first ceramic plant was established in Bogura in 1958. Owned by Tajma Ceramic Industries, it was a small manufacturing plant for porcelain tableware. Peoples Ceramic Industries, formerly Pakistan Ceramic Industries, started production in 1966. Bengal Fine Ceramics Ltd, the first Bangladeshi stoneware manufacturer, began its operations in 1986. One of the largest ceramic manufacturers in Bangladesh, Monno Ceramics, was established in 1985 to produce porcelain tableware with other ceramic items later. Shinepukur Ceramics was established in 1997 for the production of bone china and porcelain tableware. Shinepukur later captured around 60% of the domestic market.

Bayaty-Shiraz is called the ‚Äúbride of the music‚Äù in the countries which are the home of the mugham. This dastgah is played in the ‚Äúleft‚Äù tone of the Bayaty-Shiraz. The Azerbaijani tar player Bahram Mansurov notes that Bayaty-Shiraz, formerly known as Bayaty- Isfahan, existed as independent dastgah only in the early 19th century. M. Navab described Bayaty-Shiraz mugham as a section in the ‚ÄúVuzuhul-Argam‚Äù treatise, and named the fifth of 12 mug-hams as Isfahan.  Structure  Being one of the 7 main mughams of the Azerbaijani oral music, Bayaty-Shiraz has sections with the same name. \\"Ba-62 yati-Shiraz\\" and its classifications, colors and many folk songs and dances have been created on the base of Bayati- Shiraz. Composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov said that Bayaty-Shiraz mugam arouses a sense of sadness in the listeners. In the table compiled by Mirza Faraj Rzayev, Bayati-Shiraz consisted of 17 sections and chapters: ‚ÄúDaramed‚Äù, ‚ÄúBayati-Isfahan‚Äù, ‚ÄúBayati-Shiraz‚Äù, ‚ÄúAbul-Chap‚Äù, ‚ÄúJafariyya‚Äù, ‚ÄúBudashti‚Äù, ‚ÄúBayati-Kurd‚Äù, ‚ÄúHaji Yuni‚Äù, ‚ÄúGilachi, Dashti‚Äù, ‚ÄúMahdi-Zerrabi‚Äù, ‚ÄúQatar‚Äù, ‚ÄúBayati‚Äù, ‚ÄúAshiqi-Gush‚Äù, ‚ÄúNiiriz-Davudi‚Äù and ‚ÄúHuzzal‚Äù. In 1925, in the program prepared by Hajibeyov, the Bayaty-Shiraz dastgah was described as \\"Bayati- Isfahan\\" and consisted of ten sections and chapters: \\"Maye-Bayati-Shiraz\\", \\"Bayati-Isfahan\\", \\"Abul-chap\\", \\"Azerbaijan\\", ‚ÄúBayaty-Kurd‚Äù, ‚ÄúHaji Yuni‚Äù, ‚ÄúDashti‚Äù, ‚ÄúQatar‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuzzal‚Äù and ‚ÄúBayati-Shiraz.‚Äù When comparing the Bayaty- Shiraz dastgahs in the mugham table of M. F. Rzayev and the mugham program of Uzeyir Hajibeyov, it turns out that, some sections and chapters are same. As a result of the development of Bayaty-Shiraz some sections and chapters were removed from the dastgah. Thus, some parts and chapters were cut off from the components as they did not correspond to the Bayaty-Shiraz dastgah. The subgenre of ‚ÄúAzerbaijan‚Äù began to be used in the footsteps of \\"Shahnaz\\" (cadence), \\"Bayati-Kurd\\" as \\"Nava\\" dastgah, in parallel as small independent \\"Bayati-Kurd\\" mugam, \\"Haji Yuni\\" as ‚ÄúShur‚Äù, \\"Qatar\\" as \\"Mahur-hindi\\". The \\"Dashti\\" dastgah first existed as a branch in \\"Nava\\", and then began to be used as a small independent mugham called \\"Dashti\\". = Maye-Bayaty-Shiraz = Presently the Bayaty-Shiraz dastgah consists of 8 sections and chapters: ‚ÄúBardasht‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaye-Bayati-Shiraz‚Äù, ‚ÄúNishibi-Faraz‚Äù, ‚ÄúBayati-Isfahan‚Äù, ‚ÄúZil Bayat-Shiraz‚Äù, ‚ÄúKhavaran‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuzzal‚Äù, ‚ÄúDulruba‚Äù and ‚ÄúFoot to Bayati-Shiraz‚Äù (cadence). The khananda, who sings mughams, performs the fast-paced \\"Nishibi- sepat\\" instead of \\"Bardasht\\". Some khanandas start Bayaty-Shiraz dastagh with \\"Maye-Bayaty-Shiraz\\". Some of them begin with the part of ‚ÄúMolevi‚Äù of \\"Bardasht\\" of Bayaty-Shiraz. The ‚ÄúMolevi‚Äù is followed by the Maye-Bayaty- Shiraz, one of the main sections of the dastgah. This section is the basis of the Bayaty-Shiraz dastgah. = Nishibi-faraz = After Maye-Bayati-Shiraz, \\"Nishibi-faraz\\" section is played. \\"Nishibi-faraz\\" also serves as a connecting role, which combines the \\"Maye-Bayati-Shiraz\\" and \\"Bayati-Isfahan\\" sections. The khanandas, who perform the \\"Bayati-Shiraz\\", sing \\"Bayati-Isfahan\\" after Bardasht (\\"Nishibi-sepaz\\") and \\"Maye-Bayati-Shiraz\\". At the same time \\"Nishibi-faraz\\" plays the role of transition ‚ÄúSarenj‚Äù to the ‚ÄúMaye-Shura‚Äù. The \\"Nishibi-faraz\\" sections of ‚ÄúShur‚Äù and Bayaty-Shiraz differ from each other from melodic point of view. Thus, the \\"Nishibi-sepat\\" sections in both dastgahs have different characters and tones. The \\"Bayati Isfahan\\", the central part of the Bayati-Shiraz covers the average range of dastgah in the tessitura. Strong sounding is a prerequisite for Bayati-Isfahan's vocal and instrumental performance. = Bayati-Isfahan = After the \\"Bayati-Isfahan\\", the high-range sections are coming. These sections include ‚ÄúZil Bayaty- Shiraz‚Äù, ‚ÄúKhaveran‚Äù, ‚ÄúHuzzal‚Äù and ‚ÄúDulruba‚Äù. \\"Zil Bayaty-Shiraz\\" is the repetition of Maye-Bayati-Shiraz in high-range. There is also a difference here because of the change of the melodies' shades and the other character. In the \\"Maye-Bayaty-Shiraz\\" is dominated by sadness, in \\"Zil Bayati-Shiraz\\" rhythm is dominant. = Khaveran = The \\"Khaveran\\" section, which is performed after \\"Zil Bayati-Shiraz\\", was previously performed between \\"Shikasteyi-fars\\" and \\"Eraq\\" sections of the Rast dastgah. Then the Khawaran section was removed from the Rast dastgah, and it was positioned only between ‚ÄúBayati-Isfahan‚Äù and ‚ÄúHuzzal‚Äù sections of Bayati-Shiraz. In addition, the \\"Khaveran\\" section plays a role of bridge between Bayati-Shiraz and Segah dastgahs. = Huzzal = Khaveran is followed by \\"Huzzal\\" section. This section requires khanandas a loud voice. = Dilruba = After the \\"Uzzal\\" section, ‚ÄúDilruba‚Äù section (in Persian the word ‚Äúd√ºlr√ºba‚Äù means beautiful, favorite) is coming in a frivolous manner, which did not include Bayati-Shiraz dastgah previously.

Biography He finished fourth in the 85-kg division at the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, and later represented his nation Iran, as a 31-year-old, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Jamshidi also trained for Wrestling Club Takhti in Izhe suburb, under his personal coach Vali Mohammadi Babak. Jamshidi participated at the 1999 World Wrestling Championships in Athens, Greece, where he took home the bronze medal in the 85-kg division. On January 3, 2000, the International Federation of Associated Wrestling (FILA) stripped Jamshidi of his medal, and ordered him a two-year suspension, for testing positive on doping; as a result he could not compete at the Summer Olympics in Sydney. When his suspension expired in September 2001, Jamshidi returned to wrestling and competed in several international tournaments, including the World and Asian Championships, but achieved mediocre results and left empty-handed. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Jamshidi qualified for the Iranian squad on his official Olympic status in the men's 84 kg class. Earlier in the process, he finished first and received a berth from the Olympic Qualification Tournament in Novi Sad, Serbia and Montenegro. Jamshidi lost his opening match to Greece's Dimitrios Avramis with a 1‚Äì3 decision much to the massive cheer from the home crowd inside Ano Liossa Olympic Hall, but eventually edged Norway's Fritz Aanes in a three- point overtime decision in the second round. Finishing the pool in second place and ninth overall, Jamshidi's performance was not enough to put him further into the quarterfinals.

In Vienna such cabs are called '. Origin The earliest use of the word in English is cited by the Oxford English Dictionary as from 1699 (\\"Fiacres or Hackneys, hung with Double Springs\\").\\"Fiacre\\" in Oxford English Dictionary online, , accessed 15 June 2014 The name is derived indirectly from Saint Fiacre; the H√¥tel de Saint Fiacre in Paris rented carriages from about the middle of the seventeenth century.Marius, Richard, \\"Vita ‚Äì Saint Fiacre\\", Harvard Magazine, 1998, accessed 15 June 2014. Saint Fiacre was adopted as the cab drivers' patron saint because of the association of his name with the carriage.Finley (2010), p. 23. In Paris In 1645, Nicholas Sauvage, a coachbuilder from Amiens, decided to set up a business in Paris hiring out horses and carriages by the hour. He established himself in the H√¥tel de Saint Fiacre and hired out his four-seater carriages at a rate of 10 sous an hour. Within twenty years, Sauvage's idea had developed into the first citywide public transport system: les carosses √† 5 sous (\\"5-sou carriages\\"). These 8-seater carriages, forerunners of the modern bus, were put into service on five \\"lines\\" between May and July 1662, but had disappeared from the streets of Paris by 1679, almost certainly because of the spiralling cost of fares.Mellot and Blancart (2006), p. 7. Although the public transport system had suffered a temporary demise, private hirers were quick to fill the gaps with carriages including the \\"vinaigrette\\", a two-wheeled chair powered and guided by two people; the cabriolet, a dangerous two-wheeled buggy pulled by a single horse; and the more traditional four-wheeled fiacres. By the time of the Revolution there were more than 800 fiacres operating in Paris. In 1855, Napol√©on III instigated a monopoly control of the fiacres of Paris via the Compagnie Imp√©riale des Voitures √† Paris (CIV), which by 1860 operated 3,830 fiacres and owned 8,000 horses; in this year the CIV carried over 10 million passengers.Papayanis (1985), p. 307. Fiacre drivers earned about three francs a day, plus two francs in tips.Papayanis (1985), p. 308. In 1866 the CIV lost its monopoly status and became a Soci√©t√© Anonyme. It began to use motorized vehicles in 1898 but was still operating 3500 horse-drawn vehicles in 1911. \\"Les Compagnies de Fiacres\\" in Taxi de la Marne website, (in French), accessed 18 June 2014. In the 1890s the Parisian music-hall singer Yvette Guilbert introduced a popular song, Le fiacre, in which an aged husband sees his wife in a fiacre with her lover.Rearick (1998), 48.

The name \\"Trego\\" dates from the 1910s, just after the railroad was built. Previously, the springs had names like Hot Springs, Kyles Hot Springs (1864), Butte Spring, and Butte Hot Spring. Today, Trego is known for its hot springs, which is a long ditch with a soft mud bottom. The springs are at the north end, near the railroad tracks, and the water flows south. Garside reports that the springs have a temperature of 187F. Unlike nearby Frog Springs at the Garrett Ranch, Trego is on public land. History The area near the springs were seasonally occupied from 4000 B.P. and 1000 B.P. Fairfield states that in 1856, Ladue Vary and Fred Hines discovered the springs that were later named Trego Hot Springs when they took a short cut from Granite Creek (now known as Granite Ranch) across the Black Rock Desert playa towards Rabbit Hole Spring. When they arrived at the Humboldt River, the met a wagon train on the Nobles Emigrant Trail. Vary and Hines told the emigrants about the springs, the emigrants took the shortcut and the Nobles trail was adjusted accordingly. Alt URL \\"Hot Spr\\" appears on the 1857 map \\"Map of the Western Division of the Fort Kearney South Pass and Honey Lake Road\\" at that location. The 400 foot long trench was initially hand dug by a group led by Frederick W. Lander in 1860. Amesbury reports two 1861 entries from the diary of Edith Lockhart: \\"August 18: Pleasant day. Started at noon and went 18 miles to Rabbit Hole Springs, rested a couple of hours and went 18 more miles by the next day to Hot Springs.\\" \\"Aug. 19. A warm day - got into camp at 10 oclock in this morning, laid over till evening - when we went 12 miles to Granite Creek or Wells.\\" The area was named Trego around the time the railroad came through in the early 1900s. Carlson states that Trego was named after nearby Mount Trego, which is formally known as Old Razorback Mountain. The name Mount Trego only appears on the Pershing County Assessors Map. The earliest citation for Trego from an original source is from an April 29, 1912 newspaper article that states that \\"Borax\\" in the water was the cause of a train engine boiler explosion that killed three people. In 1993, Desert Siteworks was held at Trego. Desert Siteworks was a series of art events led by William Binzen, assisted by Judy West and John Law for three years (1992-1994).

Life Blagdon began his career as a newsboy for The Sun newspaper. He then became amanuensis to Dr. Anthony Florian Madinger Willich, a medical writer, who taught him French and German; he also learned Spanish and Italian. Blagdon became associated with the Morning Post which he helped to edit for some years. The paper was then Tory in its views, and Blagdon took a polemical line. He was imprisoned for six months in 1805, for libeling John Jervis, Earl St. Vincent as a naval administrator. In 1809 Blagdon came into conflict with William Cobbett, and in October of that year he published a prospectus, perhaps not intended seriously, of \\"Blagdon's Weekly Political Register\\", which was to commence The History of the Political Life and Writings of Cobbett, who was compared to Catiline. As a Sunday anti-Cobbett paper, Blagdon's Register was subsidised by the government, as was a similar effort of Lewis Goldsmith. Financial speculation ruined him. The Ph≈ìnix, another of his ventures, soon came to an end. He died in obscurity and poverty in June 1819, and a subscription was raised for his destitute widow and children. Works At one time Blagdon published a French Interpreter, possibly no copy being extant. In 1802 he began editing a series of Modern Discoveries (London, 1802‚Äì3, 8 vols.); the first two volumes were Vivant Denon's Travels in Egypt in the train of Napoleon Bonaparte; the next two included Sylvain Meinrad Xavier de Golb√©ry's Travels in Africa (in the Maghreb) and the remaining four were devoted to Peter Simon Pallas's Travels in the Southern Provinces of Russia. The works were translated by Blagdon from the French and German; Pallas's Travels was then translated for a second time by Blagdon, and a new edition published in 1812 (London, 2 vols., with illustrations). In 1803 Blagdon began publishing with the Rev. Francis Prevost a literary miscellany, Flowers of Literature, which ran to seven volumes (London, 1803‚Äì9). The same year he also published, with Prevost, Mooriana, or Selections from the ... Works .. . of Dr. John Moore (London, 2 vols.) The Native Judges, illustration from A Brief History of Ancient and Modern India (1805) by Francis William Blagdon In 1805 Blagdon brought out A Brief History of Ancient and Modern India (London, 3 vols). It was based on a collection of aquatints by Edward Orme, after William Daniell, James Hunter, and Francis Swain Ward. It was reissued in 1813 as an appendix to Captain Thomas Williamson's European in India (London). In 1806 he contributed the Memoirs to Orme's Graphic History of the Life, Exploits, and Death of Lord Nelson. Plate from The European in India (1813) The proposals of the Whig ministry of 1806 on Catholic emancipation induced Blagdon to publish an edition of Foxe's Book of Martyrs; it appeared as An Universal History of Christian Martyrdom . . . originally composed by John Fox . . . and now entirely rewritten ... by the Rev. J. Milner, M. A. (London, 1807). The use of the pseudonym \\"the Rev. J. Milner\\" travestied the Roman Catholic priest John Milner. Subsequent editions of Blagdon's work appeared in 1817, 1837, 1848, 1863, 1871, and in 1881; and in 1892 was published a version by Theodore Alois Buckley, described as \\"abridged from Milner's edition\\". In 1812 Blagdon contributed to Francophobia with The Situation of Great Britain in 1811, translated from the French of M. de Montgaillard (London); this evoked a reply from John Jervis White Jervis, who described Blagdon as \\"a gentleman well known in the walks of literary knowledge and of loyal authors\\". In 1814 Blagdon published An Historical Memento ... of the public Rejoicings ... in celebration of the Peace of 1814, and of the Centenary of the Accession of the House of Brunswick (London), and in 1819 a New Dictionary of Classical Quotations (London, 1819). Blagdon was also author of: * The Grand Contest ... or a View of the Causes and Probable Consequences of the threatened Invasion of Great Britain, 1803. * Remarks on a Pamphlet entitled \\"Observations on the Concise Statement of Facts by Sir Home Popham,\\" 1805. * Authentic Memoirs of George Morland, 1806; this contains many engravings of Morland's pictures. * The Modern Geographer, 1807. * Langhorne's Fables of Flora . . . with a Life of the Author, 1812. * Letters of the Princess of Wales, comprising the only true History of the celebrated \\"Book,\\" 1813; on Princess Caroline of Brunswick.

The operation was in response to an earlier massacre on August 14 the same year, where terrorists attacked a police station killing eleven security personnel shortly after the Egyptian security forces had launched a crackdown on two protest camps in Cairo where hundreds of supporters of 2013 Egyptian revolution ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi were killed. The raid came a few days after a similar operation in Minya's town of Dalga, and was part of a larger crackdown by the interim government on armed supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi.  Background  Kerdasa is a notable touristic location in Egypt, known for its textile industry, and is the biggest town in the Giza Governorate. However, some extremist Islamic movements have also been linked to it as well as neighboring Nahya. It became an Islamist stronghold once again following Mohamed Morsi's election in 2012, and after the 2013 coup d'√©tat that ousted Morsi, the town started harboring extremist elements wanted by the government. These cells became even more active there following the violent dispersal and massacre of pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo. Kerdasa was declared an Islamic state after it became under full control by the Islamists following the police station attack that killed eleven security officials.  Events  The operation in Kerdasa had been delayed in order to gather additional and conclusive intelligence on the insurgents‚Äô hideouts, according to Giza's security chief Maj. Gen. Kamal al-Daly in a statement to the Lebanese daily As-Safir. A large combined force of military and police officers backed by helicopters besieged the town and set up checkpoints by blocking all main exits with armed vehicles, as security forces started to make their move. The troops entered the town at about 05:30 local time (03:30 GMT) and used loudspeakers urging residents to stay indoors to avoid the crossfire. They were exposed to heavy gunfire shortly afterwards, forcing them to cover behind buildings along with photographers and journalists who were accompanying them. The shots came from rooftops of houses, schools and mosques. Gen. Nabil Farrag was the only person killed during the battle after being shot in the chest by the gunmen. Ten policemen were injured with shrapnel wounds in various parts of their bodies during two separate grenade attacks and live television footage showed dense smoke clouds hovering above the sites of clashes. Gen. al-Daly added that a stormtrooper division helped the special forces seize control of the city center, while the Central Security Forces worked to prevent the insurgents from escaping. Security forces exchanged fire with the militants as they conducted house-to-house searches for wanted Islamist hardliners. In one raid, special forces stormed a villa belonging to a man they claimed to have orchestrated the previous police station attack. They were supported by police armoured vehicles that smashed down the compound's gates before breaking in, but the man wasn't there. Waves of arrests were carried out and in total, between 65 and 85 people, including three main suspects in August's attack, were detained in response to 150 arrest warrants made for involved suspects in the earlier killings. In addition, the Interior Ministry stated that dozens of weapons, including three rocket-propelled grenades and several automatic firearms. There was also spillover fighting in the neighboring village of Nahya, that was subsequently besieged by security forces who conducted raids similar to Kerdasa's on wanted suspects' homes. They were also looking for Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya leader Tarek al-Zomor, who was thought to be hiding there. Television footage showed heavy gunfire as the police chased a group of men into side streets.  Reactions  Gehad El-Haddad, spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood criticized the military's move comparing it with Mubarak era tactics. \\"When you go home and you watch TV and they are calling you a terrorist and your leadership is locked up, you may join your neighbors and do something dangerous,\\" he said. Ahmed Ali, spokesman of the Egyptian Armed Forces stated that the military had to quell the militants. \\"When dealing with terrorism, the consideration of civil and human rights are not applicable. There is an insurgency already and it's increasing. They are killing people in the streets,\\" he said in a press statement. Trial On 6 August 2014, twelve detainees were sentenced to death and other 9 were sent to prison for life over killing Major General Nabil Farag.

It has been described by Al Jazeera as \\"one of the main groups\\" in the Iraqi insurgency. The Council began its insurgency against the Iraqi government in January 2014 as a unifying command for the former Sunni Arab Spring protesters that Nouri al-Maliki's government had cracked down upon since 2012. The figures associated with the MCIR have stated that it has a central command and \\"the footprints of a professional army\\", that it follows the Geneva Convention protocol rules, as well as claiming to be non-sectarian and seeking a \\"democratic solution\\" to the Iraqi crisis. The MCIR has announced its opposition to Iranian influence in Iraq and the role the IRGC have played with Iraqi security forces. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace characterized the MCIR as an Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party ‚Äì Iraq Region front group. Presence in Iraq The MCIR has a presence in Al Anbar Governorate (especially Ramadi and Fallujah), Saladin, Baghdad, Abu Ghraib, Mosul, and Diyala. After seizing and capturing Mosul, the MCIR entered it along with many opposition armed forces, including ISIL. They installed a former officer in the Iraqi Army, Major General Azhar al-Ubaidi, with the approval of the other forces that entered Mosul, as governor. A municipal worker described MCIR as administering the management of the city better than the Iraqi government, which was \\"providing electricity for only 2 or 3 hours a day,\\" and was \\"corrupt.\\" After the Iraqi Parliament approved the government of the new PM Haider al-Abadi on 8 September 2014, the MCIR stated on 9 September \\"Our people are being deceived, misled, ignored and mocked, while the political process stayed on the same faces.\\" They commented in the statement on the installation of Nouri al-Maliki as a vice-president of Fuad Masum, saying \\"Instead of prosecuting al-Maliki for his crimes and his explosive barrels that are being thrown on the heads of innocent people, the political leaders of Iraq honored him by making him vice-president of the republic of murder and destruction.\\" Relationships with other groups =Association of Muslim Scholars= The GMIR has close links with the Association of Muslim Scholars, a group that considers the current Iraqi government as illegitimate due to being the result of the United States occupation. =ISIL= The MCIR's relationship with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant is one of cooperation, yet there are significant differences between the two. Despite taking part in the same June 2014 offensive, which wrested control of much of Northern Iraq from Baghdad, MCIR spokesman and former General Muzhir al Qaisi has criticized ISIL and their strict implementation of Shari'a law, describing members of ISIL as \\"barbarians.\\" He also claimed that the MCIR was stronger than ISIL. An unnamed source for the MCIR stated: \\"We plan to avoid them [ISIS] until we are settled and operations are finished; then we will kick them out.\\" The presence of MCIR fighters on the ground has been noted by observers, who argued that United States airstrikes would \\"inflame\\" the situation in Iraq by not taking into account the diversity of the opposition to the al-Maliki regime. =Kurdish Region= The MCIR reportedly has a truce agreement with the Kurdistan Region not to target Kurdish territory, in return for the Regional Government's non-interference in the Council creating an autonomous area outside of the control of the current Iraqi government. Media Iraqi TV coverage of early 2014 events within the country was split along sectarian, religious lines. Channels loyal to Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, including the government's own al-Iraqiya TV, are rallying Iraqis to volunteer and fight to restore order and remove \\"terrorists\\". Meanwhile, Sunni channels present the latest advances by the insurgents as part of an uprising against what they call \\"al-Maliki's army.\\" According to western media, Al- Rafidain TV is particularly supportive of the cause of the \\"revolutionaries\\" and \\"mujahideen\\" who it says are fighting to liberate the country.

There are few sources that provide information of his life, although he was indubitably a powerful man.  Life  Yashovarman was king of Kannauj in the early part of the eighth century. The city (then known as Kanyakubja) had previously been ruled by Harsha, who died without an heir and thus created a power vacuum. This lasted for around a century before Yashovarman emerged as its ruler. Alexander Cunningham, an archaeologist of the British Raj period, speculated on possible rulers of Kannauj during the period between Harsha and Yashovarman but there is little evidence to support his claims. Little is known of Yashovarman or his family, with most information being derived from the Gaudavaho (Slaying of the king of Gauda), a Prakrit-language poem written by Vakpati. Yashovarman was a supporter of culture and Vakpati was among his courtiers: the extent to which the poem can be relied upon for statements of fact is impossible to determine. Vakpati's work has been variously said to describe Yashovarman as either a divine incarnation of Vishnu or a kshatriya of the Lunar dynasty; Cunningham considered him likely to be related to the Maukharis, who had ruled Kannauj prior to Harsa, and some Jain works say that he was related to the Chandraguptas who ruled the Mauryan empire. The dates of his reign are also obscure, with assertions including 728‚Äì745 (Vincent A. Smith), around the late-seventh century/early eighth-century (Sankara Panduranga Pandit) and, according to the calculations of Ramashandra Tripathi, probably 725‚Äì752. The Gaudavaho depicts Yashovarman as conquering large swathes of northern India ‚Äî including Bihar, Bengal, the western Deccan, Indus Valley and Kashmir ‚Äî before returning in triumph to Kannauj. However, Kalhana, a Kashmiri court chronicler who lived around the 12th century CE, gives a very different story in his Rajatarangini, depicting Yashovarman as a ruler who was among those defeated by Lalitaditya Muktapida, a ruler of Kashmir. The variant claims of stupendous conquests given by both of these courtiers are improbable, with Tripathi saying of those in the Gaudavaho that \\"These exploits read more like fiction than sober history\\". Other early sources are the Prabhavakacarita, Prabandha Kosha and Bappabhattasuricarita, which are Jain documents. Although R. C. Majumdar is among those who are wary of the ancient accounts of conquests, he believes that Yashovarman was \\"unquestionably the most powerful king [in the region] about this time.\\" He believes that diplomatic relations existed between the Chinese court and that in Kannuaj, evidenced by Yashovarman sending a minister to China in 731, and that he was for a time in alliance with Muktapida, with the two rulers defeating the Tibetans. These two diplomatic events may be connected because China was at that time at war with Tibet but it is also possible that the Chinese relationship grew from a shared concern about the growth of Arab power. The alliance with Muktapida collapsed around 740, according to Majumdar because of jealousy felt by the Kashmiri king. While Majumdar says that Lalitaditya then defeated Yashovarman and annexed his lands, Tripathi believes that Kalhana's account of what happened is inconsistent and that Yashovarman may have been allowed to remain on his throne after a \\"nominal acknowledgement of supremacy\\" to Lalitaditya.  Legacy  Little physical evidence exists of Yashovarman's reign, although he is reputed to have constructed the temple at Harischandranagari (present-day Ayodhya). An inscription has been found at Nalanda, and some coins elsewhere, that may relate to him but there is no certainty. According to the Jain chronicles, Yashovarman had a son named ƒÄma, who succeeded him as the king of Kannauj during 749-753 CE. Historian Shyam Manohar Mishra believes this claim to be historically true, as it is not contradicted by any historical evidence. C. V. Vaidya theorized that the Ayudha rulers were descendants of Yashovarman, but no historical records connect the two dynasties. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar similarly proposed that Vajrayudha and Indrayudha were names of ƒÄma. But this theory is contradicted by the Jain accounts.

It lies on the Swiss side of the Pennine Alps, although its upper basin touches the Italian region of the Aosta Valley. The glacier descends from the west side of the Breithorn () and splits into two diverging branches above Gandegg: the Upper Theodul Glacier (Oberer Theodulgletscher), spilling on a high plateau near Trockener Steg, together with the Furgg Glacier, and the Lower Theodul Glacier (Unterer Theodulgletscher), reaching a height of about above the Gorner Glacier. Both branches are part of the Rhone basin, through the rivers Gornera, Mattervispa, and Vispa. Slightly above the glacier splitting is the Theodul Pass, crossing the border between Switzerland and Italy, and connecting Zermatt to Breuil- Cervinia. On the west, the Theodul Glacier is overlooked by the Matterhorn. Until about 1980s the Lower Theodul Glacier was still connected to the Gorner Glacier and one of its tributaries. The upper section of the Theodul Glacier consists of a flat plateau at around 3,800 metres, named Breithorn Plateau. The plateau lies between the Breithorn, the Gobba di Rollin and the Klein Matterhorn. The Breithorn Pass (3,814 m) separates the Breithorn from the Gobba di Rollin (). A 3,795 m high saddle lies between the Gobba di Rollin and the Klein Matterhorn. Between the Klein Matterhorn and the Breithorn is a distinct glacier, named Klein Matterhorn Gletscher, which joins the Lower Theodul Glacier at about 3,000 metres. The Breithorn Plateau area can be easily accessed by several cable cars connecting Zermatt to the Klein Matterhorn. At around 3,500 metres is the Plateau Rosa, whose name derives from the Vald√¥tain patois term Rou√©se, meaning \\"ice\\" (as for the nearby Monte Rosa). This area lies between Testa Grigia () (3,479 m) and the Klein Matterhorn, south of and slightly above the Theodul Pass. Southeast of Testa Grigia is a saddle named Passo di Ventina Nord (3,445 m). This area can also be easily accessed by several cable cars connecting Breuil-Cervinia to Testa Grigia. Most of the glacier is part of the year-round ski area marketed as Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. It is the highest in Europe and largest summer ski area in the world, with 21 kilometres of prepared pistes.Summer Skiing Zermatt Bergbahnen The culminating point is on the summit of Gobba di Rollin and the lowest is above Trockener Steg. The Matterhorn Glacier Paradise links the ski areas of Zermatt and Breuil-Cervina. Ski lifts connect Trockener Steg, Theodul Pass, Testa Grigia, Klein Matterhorn and Gobba di Rollin. A chair lift also connects Trockener Steg to the Furggsattel (3,349 m), north of the Theodul Pass. Several lakes recently formed at the bottom of the Upper Theodul Glacier, west of Trockener Steg. The largest, named Theodulgletschersee is 7.76 ha wide and lies at an elevation of 2,851 metres above sea level. It is the highest lake over 4 ha in Switzerland and the largest lake in the Matter Valley (the valley of Zermatt).

Despite being banned in favor of monophony (, edinoglasiye, literally \\"single-voicing\\"), i.e. singing the chants one by one consecutively, it persisted for quite some time. History The tradition of polyphony arose in early 16th century, when chants transformed from being performed recitatively to being elaborately sung.

Empire Jean-Baptiste-Auguste Vinchon was born in Paris on 5 August 1789. He became a painter of historical subjects, and a printer. Vinchon was a pupil of Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli in his Paris studio. He won the second Prix de Rome for painting in 1813 and the first Prix de Rome in 1814 for his painting of Diagoras Carried in Triumph by His Sons.Grunchec, P. (1985). The Grand Prix de Rome: Paintings from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, 1797-1863. Washington, DC: International Exhibitions Foundation. p. 63. . During the First French Empire (1804‚Äì14) Vinchon and Nicolas Gosse painted a number of Scenes from Ancient Life in grey scale for the Louvre, based on the plates of Antichit√† di Ercolano. Bourbon Restoration In 1816‚Äì17 the Comte de Blacas arranged for the church of Santissima Trinit√† dei Monti, beside the Villa Medici, to be renovated and redecorated. Former and current winners of the Prix de Rome were commissioned to undertake the work, including Vichon, Jean- Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Henri-Joseph de Forestier, L√©on Palli√®re, Fran√ßois- √âdouard Picot, Jean Alaux and Jean-Baptiste Thomas. In 1822 Vinchon painted frescoes for a chapel at the church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris. During the Bourbon Restoration (1815‚Äì1830) and July Monarchy (1830‚Äì1848) Vinchon would be considered one of the juste milieu artists, who also included D√©sir√© Court, Horace Vernet, Charles-√âmile-Callande de Champmartin and Ary Scheffer. This school steered a middle way between classicists such as Auguste Couder and romantics such as Eug√®ne Delacroix. In 1827 Vinchon was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honor. After the July Revolution, on 30 September 1830 Fran√ßois Guizot, the Minister of the Interior, initiated three competitions for paintings for the meeting room of the new chamber of deputies. Each of the paintings was to represent the duties of the deputy to resist tyranny and resist sedition. Three subjects were defined: The Oath of Louis-Philippe in the Chamber of Deputies in August 1830; the Protest by Mirabeau against the orders of Louis XVI of France communicated to the States General by the Henri Evrard, marquis de Dreux-Br√©z√©; and Fran√ßois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas standing up to the mob. Fran√ßois Antoine de Boissy d'Anglas standing up to the mob (detail; 1830) Vinchon won the competition for the third subject with his painting. This depicted an incident on 20 May 1795 when the mob broke into the National Convention, killed one of the deputies, and presented his head to Boissy on the end of a pike. Boissy saluted his comrade and retained his seat, saving the day and damaging the populist movement of the revolution. Vinchon's painting represents the agitators as ferocious, crazed and moronic. At the left of the picture agents are shown bribing one of the rioters. A copy of the painting decorated one wall of the H√¥tel de Ville of Paris for several years, but was burned during the fire of 1871. In 1848 Vinchon painted Louis Philippe with his company visiting the Galerie de Pierre in Versailles to see how a statue of Joan of Arc looked by torchlight. The painting is now held by the Mus√©e National in Versailles. Last years Vinchon became head of one of the leading printing houses in Paris, Impr. de Vinchon et C. de Mourgues. He died at the bathing resort of Ems, in the Duchy of Nassau, in 1855. His body was brought back to Paris to be inhumed in his family tomb. He was buried on 23 August 1855. Camille Doucet spoke at his funeral, as did the foreman and the cashier of the printing house. He was aged sixty-nine. He is buried in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Works Vachon's works exhibited in the Salon included: * 1822 Dedication of the young Mazet 11 x 9.6 feet * 1824 Death of Comola; * 1824 Joan of Arc on the walls of Orleans 10.6 x 9 feet * 1827 Old Greek old man sitting in the ruins of his burned house * 1827 Propertius and Cynthia at Tivoli * 1827 Shepherd near Rome asleep on the ruins of a tomb of emperor * 1850 Volunteer Enrollment of 1792 A stylized view of an event in the Revolution, depicting an orderly procession of volunteers in neat uniforms * 1855 D√©part des volontaires. This painting sold for 20,000 francs, a huge amount at the time. Vachon also painted various frescoes in Rome.

It was established by local musician Tom Dyer and was active from 1983‚Äì1991 and from 2009 to present, with sporadic releases in the interim. It is currently headquartered in Olympia, Washington, US.  History  Green Monkey Records was established in 1983 by local musician Tom Dyer, who was inspired to begin recording and producing music after a recording session at Seattle's Triangle Studios. Using a \\"Teac four-track reel-to-reel and a Tapco 6200B mixer from a guy in a parking garage downtown,\\" Dyer began recording and mixing music in his apartment in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Early clients included Mr. Epp and the Calculations, featuring Mark Arm (later of Mudhoney fame). After Dyer's landlord found out, the operation was quickly moved to the basement of a rented house on the north side of Seattle's Queen Anne Hill. Between 1983 and 1991, Green Monkey Records released 44 albums. The label's biggest brush with commercial success came from the Green Pajamas' album \\"Book of Hours,\\" a followup to the single \\"Kim the Waitress\\" Humphrey 1995, p.106. 'Tom Dyer's Green Monkey label released ... the group that became Dyer's principle interest, Green Pajamas....Led by the delightful acid-pop vocals and lyrics of Jeff Kelly (with bassist/co-songwriter Joe Ross (later in 64 Spiders), Steve Lawrence, Bruce Haedt and Karl Wilhelm), the Pajamas first made the self-released tape Summer of Lust, the hooked up with Dyer and scored a regional hit in 1984 with the dreamy love-ode \\"Kim The Waitress\\", clocking in at over six minutes of ethereal innocence. (Dyer mixed a shorter version for airplay on KJET, whose automation equipment couldn't play tapes longer than five minutes.)' that was two years in the making. The label's had reached its heyday by 1987, and by 1988, changing priorities (including the birth of Dyer's first child) and new responsibilities (teaching at the Art Institute of Seattle) had begun to impact the label. In 1991, Dyer sold the majority of his recording equipment and closed the studio, although he did occasionally release new material, such as the Green Pajamas' Caroler's Song EP.  Sound and Cultural Impact  Although Green Monkey Records has never enjoyed significant commercial success, the label does have a cult following. The label's sound has been categorized as \\"post-punk/pre-grunge Seattle\\" and \\"indy pop music‚Äîgood honest, ballsy, delicate, garage-y, punky, folky, mildly trippy pop music\\". The label has received positive press from local \\"listener- powered\\" indie radio station KEXP as well as a number of indie music bloggers.  Revival  In 2009, Green Monkey Records released a 2 CD compilation album, titled \\"It Crawled from the Basement: the green monkey records anthology.\\" The album featured 47 tracks by 32 artists. To celebrate, Dyer orchestrated a release party at the SoDo Showbox featuring nine bands: The Green Pajamas, The Icons, The Purdins, Capping Day, The Queen Annes, Prudence Dredge, Liquid Generation, The Elements and Slam Suzanne. Inspired by positive press, Dyer began releasing more material, including several reissues, but notably new material and new artists as well. As of December 2016, the label has released 52 more albums, with a significant number of contributions by Dyer or Jeff Kelly and the Green Pajamas.http://www.discogs.com/label/55726-Green-Monkey-Records  Christmas Albums  One notable fact about the label is that, since 2010, every year it has released a Christmas compilation to benefit the charity MusiCares. Contributors include Green Monkey veterans such as The Green Pajamas, The Queen Annes, and Eric Padget (of Sigourney Reverb), as well as other artists from around the country, and of course, Dyer himself. Critical reception of the albums has been favorable, with Stubby's House of Christmas declaring that \\"somehow, every GD year, Green Monkey puts out one of the best Christmas albums of the year.\\"  Discography  1983 Various Artists - Local Product (Cassette GM 001) Tom Dyer - Truth or Consequences (Cassette GM 002) 1984 Me Three - No Money ...

Construction and commissioning  launched by VT Halter Marine at Moss Point, Mississippi, on 19 December 2007. Pisces was built by VT Halter Marine at Moss Point, Mississippi, and was launched on 19 December 2007, sponsored by Dr. Annette Nevin Shelby, the wife of United States Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. The ship was commissioned into service as NOAAS Pisces (R 226) on 6 November 2009.noaa.gov NOAA Ship Pisces To name the ship and promote interest in science, NOAA held a regional contest requiring submission of a proposed name and an accompanying essay supporting the choice of name. The winning entry, submitted by five seventh graders at Sacred Heart Elementary School in Southaven, Mississippi, was Pisces.  Characteristics and capabilities  NOAAS Pisces (R 226) seen from her rescue boat.Capable of conducting multidisciplinary oceanographic operations in support of biological, chemical, and physical process studies, Pisces was commissioned as the third of a class of five of the most advanced fisheries research vessels in the world, with a unique capability to conduct both fishing and oceanographic research. She is a stern trawler with fishing capabilities similar to those of commercial fishing vessels. She is rigged for longlining and trap fishing and can conduct trawling operations to depths of 6,000 feet (1,829 meters). Her most advanced feature is the incorporation of United States Navy-type acoustic quieting technology to enable NOAA scientists to monitor fish populations without the ships noise altering the behavior of the fish, including advanced quieting features incorporated into her machinery, equipment, and propeller. Her oceanographic hydrophones are mounted on a retractable centerboard, or drop keel, that lowers scientific transducers away from the region of hull-generated flow noise, enhancing the quality of the data collected. To take full advantage of these advanced data-gathering capabilities, she has the Scientific Sonar System, which can accurately measure the biomass of fish in a survey area. She also has an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler with which to collect data on ocean currents and a multibeam sonar system that provides information on the content of the water column and on the type and topography of the seafloor while she is underway, and she can gather hydrographic data at any speed up to 11 knots (20 km/hr). Pisces has a traction-type oceanographic winch which can deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope, electromechanical cable, or fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, each of which can deploy 3,500 meters (11,480 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) electromechanical cable, two trawl winches, each of which has a 35-metric-ton pull and can deploy 4,000 meters (13,123 feet) of 28.5-mm (1‚Öõ-inch) warp wire, and a Gilson winch. She has a telescopic boom and an articulated boom, each with a lifting capacity of 8,000 pounds (3,629 kg. She has an A-frame on her starboard side and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Pisces the capability to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her hydrographic winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps, and she has modified outriggers for shrimp trawling and gear testing. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Pisces also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays. While trawling, Pisces uses wireless and hard-wired systems to monitor the shape of the trawl net and to work in conjunction with an autotrawl system that sets trawl depth and trawl wire tension and adjusts the net configuration. Pisces has a 56-square-meter (m¬≤) (602-square-foot) (sq. ft.) wet laboratory, a 15-m¬≤ (156-sq.-ft.) dry laboratory, a 27-m¬≤ (290-sq.-ft.) chemistry laboratory, and a 46-m¬≤ (495-sq.-ft.) acoustic and computer laboratory. She also has a 19-m¬≤ (204-sq.-ft.) walk-in scientific freezer, a 9-m¬≤ (96-sq.-ft.) controlled environment room, and a 5-m¬≤ (54-sq.-ft.) preservation alcove. She has 145 m¬≤ (1,560 sq. ft.) of open deck space aft for fishing and scientific operations and another 33 m¬≤ (355 sq. ft.) of open deck space at the side sampling station on her starboard side. All of her discharge pipes empty off her port side so that fluids disharged will not contaminate samples collected at the station on her starboard side. In addition to her crew of 21, Pisces can accommodate up to 17 scientists.  Service history  Operated by NOAAs Office of Marine and Aviation Operations and with Pascagoula, Mississippi, as her home port, Pisces collects, monitors, and studies data on a wide range of sea life and ocean conditions, primarily in the waters of the United States exclusive economic zone in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Atlantic Ocean as far north as North Carolina. The ship collects data that scientists use to study variations in ocean conditions and sea life - including shrimp and other marine invertebrates, reef fish, and groundfishnoaa.gov NOAA Deepwater Horizon Archive - to better understand the sustainability of fisheries, the structure and function of ecosystems, fish habitats and habitat restoration, coral reefs, and the status of protected species. She also makes weather and sea state observations, reports on other environmental conditions, conducts habitat assessments, and surveys marine mammal and seabird populations. During the latter half of 2010, Pisces conducted several cruises in the Gulf of Mexico to assess the effect of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill on marine life there and to monitor the water column in the vicinity of the Deepwater Horizon wellhead during post-spill wellhead testing.

The cross was originally erected in the late 14th or early 15th century in the main street, and was moved to its current site in the late 18th or early 19th century. Although the head of the cross is missing, the shaft and socket stone are original. The cross is in the care of English Heritage and is managed by the National Trust. History The name Buttercross originates from their location in market places, where people from neighbouring villages would gather around the market cross to buy locally produced products. The fresh produce was laid out and displayed on the stepped bases of the cross. The market in Dunster attracted people from surrounding villages and towns as far away as Taunton and Bodmin. The Dunster Butter Cross was erected in the late 14th or early 15th century and originally stood in the High Street, possibly at the southern end of the high street, near the Yarn Market. A cross, which was later known as the high cross, was recorded in 1461; by 1689 it was known as the Butter Cross. It was moved to its current location on St George's Street at the edge of the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition is that it was moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then. The cross is in the care of English Heritage and is managed by the National Trust. Architecture The cross comprises a shaft with a plinth and socket stone forming the base. The octagonal base and polygonal shaft have survived, but the head of the cross has been lost. It stands on a small area of raised ground. The socket stone is wide and high. The surviving shaft is high and changes from square to octagonal as it rises. There is an inscription on the northern face which says \\"WC, 1871, WS\\" recording a restoration.

It is approximately long. It flows through Foster Township, Dennison Township, and Butler Township. Long Hollow is a tributary of the creek. The creek's watershed has an area of . It is a high-quality coldwater fishery in its upper reaches and a Class A Wild Trout Fishery for part of its distance. The creek is in the upper reaches of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. It is named after a community in Berks County, Pennsylvania known as Oley. Course Oley Creek begins in Foster Township, on the northern side of Green Mountain. It flows north for some distance before crossing Interstate 80 and receiving the tributary Long Hollow. Here, the creek turns west, exiting Foster Township and entering Dennison Township. It continues flowing parallel to Interstate 80 in this township, as well as flowing near the southern edge of Mount Yeager. After a short distance, it turns southwest, away from Interstate 80 and Mount Yeager. The creek passes by a strip mine and turns west, exiting Dennison Township. Upon exiting Dennison Township, the creek enters Butler Township, where it enters a lake. On the other side of the lake, the creek flows for a short distance before reaching its confluence with Nescopeck Creek. =Tributaries= Oley Creek has one named tributary: Long Hollow. It is in the creek's upper reaches and mostly flows west. Its source is on Mount Yeager. Hydrology The pH of Oley Creek is 6.4 and the concentration of alkalinity is 6 milligrams per liter. The hardness of the creek's water is 7 milligrams per liter. The specific conductance is 63 Œºmhos. Oley Creek is somewhat affected by acid mine drainage. It has also experienced acid rain. Annually, of erosion flows through Oley Creek, as does of sediment. The annual load of nitrogen in the creek is and the annual load of phosphorus is . The creek's nitrogen and phosphorus accounts for 1.7 percent and 3 percent of Nescopeck Creek's nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively. Watershed, geography, and geology The watershed of Oley Creek is located in the upper part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. It has an area of 7.2 square miles. The elevation of the creek at its mouth is above sea level. The creek is from the Lehigh River, but is not part of that river system. There are of state roads in the watershed of Oley Creek. Significantly more than 80 percent of the watershed's area is forest. Within of the creek, approximately 80 percent of the land is forested, while less than 10 percent is agricultural land and less than 3 percent is barren. Beech Mountain Lake is near part of Oley Creek. There is a pond with a surface area of that is located at the headwaters of an unnamed tributary of the creek. A valley known as the Oley Valley is located on Oley Creek. All of the Class A Wild Trout Waters on Oley Creek are public and open. History and etymology Oley Creek's name comes from the historic community of Oley, in Berks County, which in turn may derive from the Delaware words olink, w√≥link, olo, or wahlo, which mean \\"a cavern cell, a sinkhole, a dug hole to bury anything in, as also a tract of land encompassed by high hills\\". Historically, Oley Creek was on the western edge of the territory of the Munsee people. In the past, there were coal mines on Oley Creek near Green Mountain. In the early 1970s, a tributary of the creek was dammed to produce the Lake of the Four Seasons, also known as Beech Mountain Lake. In 2000, the Eastern Pennsylvania Marine Properties Company purchased on the lake. The Oley Creek Watershed Association was established on September 4, 2003. Biology Although Oley Creek is considered to be an infertile stream, it is also designated as a Class A Wild Brook Trout fishery for a stretch from the mouth of Long Hollow downstream to Interstate 80. The upper reaches of the watershed are designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery.

Career  Codallos y Rabal joined the Spanish Army in his youth, soon achieving the rank of Major.A Concise History of New Mexico. Posted by L. Bradford Prince, LL. D. In 1743, he was appointed governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico. = Trade, justice, and policy measures = After assuming the charge of governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, Codallos started to issue new laws. They included banning illegal trade and gambling, and the posting of notices for caravans that came from elsewhere in New Spain. Residents in Albuquerque presented a petition to the governor , asking for permission to sell wool locally and as an export. This sparked a debate among officials of the city of Santa Fe, which led to acceptance of the wool trade and beginning of a trade route between Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Santa Cruz within the province. Some of the excess wool was exported to outlying regions of the province and other provinces within New Spain, providing favorable commerce for Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. In 1745, Codallos made a \\"vista general\\" (general visit), traveling across all the towns and cities of the province and asking the inhabitants to send him a list of their problems. After this, the population gathered in the square of Santa Fe, where the governor invited them to voice complaints against local officials or the government. Codallos y Rabal visited most towns and all Spanish settlements, with the exceptions of the distant \\"villages\\" of the Acoma Pueblo and Zuni people. The visit benefited the natives more than the Spanish settlers who lived there, and left the province in peaceable condition. During the tenure of Codallos, crime increased slightly. A major case of crime in the Codallos government was instigated by Manuel Sanz de Garvisu, who caused an insurrection and disobeyed the governor. As a result, Sanz de Garvisu was seized and sent to Chihuahua with an armed escort. He was then sent to Mexico City to be tried before the viceroy.A Forgotten Kingdom: The Spanish Frontier in Colorado and New Mexico, 1540-1821. BLM Cultural Resources Series (Colorado: No. 29) Chapter VII: Indians, Traders and Trouble, 1735-1750 = Relations with the Native Americans = Early in the governor's term, Codallos proposed a campaign against the Native American people. He forbade the mistreatment of women and children, but only while campaigns were ongoing. There are no records of additional campaigns. Later, Codallos prepared an unsuccessful campaign against the Gila Apache people. In 1745, Codallos authorized sending troops on an Indian reductions \\"crusade for Christianity,\\" led by the priest Carlos Delgado and Jos√© de Yrigoyen, to the Moquis people. This conversion attempt was unsuccessful. Codallos often fought the Utes and Comanches. In October, 1747, Codallos (according to the historian L. Bradford Prince) \\"killed 107, captured 206, and secured about 1000 horses\\". In 1748, he ordered that all persons who had left the presidio of El Paso del Norte return there at once. The purpose of this decree was to increase the number of people available for a campaign against the Indians who, following the Gila Campaign of 1747, had attacked Spanish settlements. In that same year (1747), a Gen√≠zaro sent a statement to Codallos regarding the conditions of Navajo lands. The Gen√≠zaro were a group of persons of Native American origin who were divided into mestizos, semi-Christianized Amerindians, freed captives, the Amerindians who were outcasts and Christianized, and some outcasts. He noted that the Navajos were being attacked by the people of the Ute lands, though they were loyal to the Spanish. However, the governor could not help the Navajo, and they continued to be attacked by the Ute people. In 1748, under his administration, the Franciscan Menchero re-established the Sandia Pueblo.L.

In this novel training method, limb (legs or arms) blood flow is restricted via the occlusion cuff throughout the contraction cycle and rest period. This results is partial restriction of arterial inflow to muscle, but, most significantly restricts venous outflow from the muscle. Given the light-load nature and strengthening capacity of BFR training, it can provide an effective clinical rehabilitation stimulus without the high levels of joint stress and cardiovascular risk associated with heavy- load training Application Many practitioners use The Occlusion Cuff as well as BFR protocols based on published scientific literature. The current approaches that focus on applying BFR during exercise consist of automatic pneumatic tourniquet systems, handheld inflatable device or automatic inflatable devices, called The Occlusion Cuff. Research demonstrating the influence of thigh circumference and cuff width on occlusion pressure has accentuated a likely need for an individualised approach to BFR, particularly with regard to the setting of the restriction pressure. More recently, a technique to calculate and prescribe the occlusive stimulus as a percentage of total limb occlusion pressure is just one example of efforts to account for the above factors and provide an individualised approach to prescribing BFR training that is relatively quick and inexpensive. While the relationship between BFR pressure and the underlying tissue compression during exercise is not yet fully understood, BFR training using 40%‚Äì80% of limb occlusion pressure is safe and effective when supervised by experienced practitioners; therefore, lower pressures may provide less risk without the need for higher pressure.  Adaptations  Historically, heavy exercise loads of approximately 70% of an individual's one repetition maximum (1RM) have been deemed necessary to elicit muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. In recent years, research has demonstrated that augmentation of low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) to the active musculature can produce significant hypertrophy and strength gains, using loads as low as 30% 1RM. BFR training has been found to yield hypertrophy responses comparable to that observed with heavy-load resistance training. Recently, it has also been indicated that BFR training induces beneficial changes in tendon structure and tendon stiffness . Risks When using belts and lifting straps for tourniquet, the amount of pressure on the vasculature cannot be controlled and there are reports of rhabdomyolysis cases due to VOT(Vascular Occlusion Training).Big Ass Mass: Occlusion Training, Bryan Haycock, FLEX A proponent of the method, Dr. Yoshiaki Sato, risked his life in 1967 after uncontrolled sessions of VOT, leading him to focus more on control and adjustment of the pressure applied on the vasculature.

Schoellkopf above the Niagara Gorge near the American Falls, downriver from Rainbow Bridge. Understanding the growing need for electricity and the role of harnessing the Falls, Schoellkopf purchased the land for the hydraulic canal on May 1, 1877 for $71,000. After Schoellkopf Sr.'s death in 1903, his sons took over the operation of the power business. In 1918, Schoellkopf's Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company merged with the Niagara Falls Power Company, which was owned by Edward Dean Adams. The Plant was considered by some to be the greatest hydroelectric plant at the time. Much of the site is, as of 2014, occupied by the Maid of the Mist tour boat company as a maintenance area and off-season boat storage yard. The power station remains form a part of a fully accessible tourist attraction associated with Niagara Falls State Park and is connected with its Niagara Gorge hiking trail system. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs Station No. 1 In 1853 construction of a \\"Hydraulic Canal\\" was begun, intended to bring water from the Niagara River above the falls to the river bluff below the falls. The original 1874 plant did not produce electricity but used water turbines to power belts and drive shafts for nearby mills. In 1882 Schoellkopf partnered with Charles Brush who had come to Niagara Falls with a dynamo and 16 carbon arc lights which were used on the streets of Niagara Falls, New York.https://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/niagara-falls-history/niagara-falls- power-development/the-history-of-power-development-in-niagara/schoellkopf- power-plant/ The first dynamo had a capacity of 1,800 horsepower and ran up to 1904 when it was abandoned in favor of Station No. 2. it was also known as the Quigley Pulp - Lower Mill and the Cliff Paper - Lower Mill.http://www.tesla2niagara.com/--ac-energy--.php Electric Power Generation at Niagara Schoellkopf mills in 1900, on the lower right is the incomplete Station No. 2 next to Station No. 1. All of the old mills pictured on the left were eliminated to make way for Station No. 3c to be completed. Station No. 2 In 1898 a second much larger hydroelectric plant was built at the base of the bluff, immediately in front of Schoellkopf's original 1874 plant, and reached a capacity of 34,000 hp before being shut down in 1921.  Station No. 3 Station No. 3a was completed by 1914 and housed 13 10,000-hp turbines. Station No. 3b began construction in 1918 and contained three generators totaling 112,500 hp. Station No. 3c was completed by 1924 with a capacity of 210,000 hp. As the old hydraulic canal was already operating at capacity a new tunnel was constructed to supply the new station. Schoellkopf Station No. 3a, 3b and 3c outside of the picture on the right is Station No. 2. Collapse On June 7, 1956, water began seeping into the back of the plant from the wall built against the bluff, causing the wall to crack. At 5 p.m. that day, Station No. 3c and then Station No. 3b flooded and collapsed into the Niagara River, destroying two thirds of the plant and the six generators that produced more than 300,000 horsepower. The grid lost 400,000 kilowatts of power and damage was estimated at $100m. The remains of the Plant either toppled into the gorge or were razed soon after. Station 3A was damaged, but remained in operation at reduced volume until 1961. The collapse led to the passage of the 1957 Niagara Redevelopment Act. Station No. 3a was demolished in 1962 as part of Robert Moses's work to beautify the American side of the Falls. The energy lost by the 1956 collapse was replaced by the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant, which was commissioned in 1961. The only permanently extant part of the Schoellkopf site is the stone wall (known as Power Station No. 3), which was built during beautification efforts in 1908-10. That wall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2013. However, depending on the seasonal flow of the River, it's sometimes possible to see the twisted steel girders and even a generator turbine that fell into the River.

It was founded in 2007 by Alan Linn and Steve Ruggi, who intended it to be a modern incarnation of the traditional gentlemen's club. Like the fine arts focused Century Association, the Norwood Club draws its membership from New York City's arts and creative community. Linn describes the Norwood Club as a \\"club for the curious.\\" The Norwood Club's members have reciprocity with other private clubs in London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, South Africa, Sydney, Paris, Dublin, Budapest, Toronto, Buenos Aires, and Shanghai.  Clubhouse  The Norwood Club is located in a five-story brownstone townhouse at 241 West 14th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues built in 1847 for bond merchant Andrew S. Norwood - who was an active developer in the 14th Street area - and known as the Andrew Norwood House.Staff (1989) \\"Andrew Norwood House\\" (plaque) New York Landmarks Preservation Foundation In the 1840s, Norwood built three townhouses on the north side of West 14th Street between 7th and 8th Avenues, including the Norwood House, which then was a fashionable area of northern Manhattan. The matching houses, which were the first brick or masonry residences to be built on the street, were designed in the Italianate style with late Greek Revival details. Norwood and his family moved into the Norwood House in 1847, and the two houses to the left and right of #241, at #239 and #243, were sold by the beginning of 1853; #243 was later a speakeasy called the Tammany Tough Club. Andrew S. Norwood's son, Andrew G. Norwood, inherited the home in 1858 following his father's death in 1856. It remained in the family until the turn of the century. Later on, the house was used for various purposes, including a boarding house, the New York Deaconesses Home of the Methodist Church, and a funeral home. In 1976, Raf Borello purchased and restored the home and used it as his private residence until his death in 2005. During this time, the building's exterior was given landmark status. In 2006, Borello's heirs sold the home to a group that included Alan Linn who founded the Norwood Club in it. Linn employed British interior designer Simon Costin to convert the space without losing its artistic and historical integrity. The Norwood Club then opened its doors in 2007. The Norwood House contains 13 marble fireplaces, mahogany interior doors, elaborate plaster ceiling moldings, a cast iron balcony, an elegant curving staircase, and a stained glass skylight. Today, the Norwood Club contains a restaurant, two lounge bars, a screening room and a walled garden with seating. The top floor houses the screening room and a small roof deck. A hidden door on the main floor leads to a staircase to the lower dining room, which members can use for private events. The entire club features paintings, drawings and sculptures that are curated once each year. Many of the art pieces and books that are displayed are from current members. The house has been a NYC Landmark since 1978 and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979. It is one of the few townhouses of its type still extant in Manhattan.  Membership  Club membership is selective. The application process includes completing written questions which address one's interests in the arts and motivation for joining Norwood, as well as a required interview and tour of the facilities. The club has about 1100 members, as well as a wait-list for new members.

He later became an art dealer. Life Born about 1715, he was the younger son of the Rev. John Dalton of Whitehaven in Cumberland; John Dalton, D.D., the poet, was his elder brother. He trained as an artist, and went to Rome to pursue his studies. In 1749 Dalton travelled with Roger Kynaston and John Frederick to Naples, South Italy, and Sicily, where they joined a party consisting of James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont, Francis Pierpoint Burton, and others. Dalton then accompanied Charlemont on his tour to Constantinople, Greece, and Egypt. Dalton managed to obtain the position of librarian to George III when the future king was Prince of Wales, and, after the king's accession, continued in his post through the favour of the Earl of Bute. He was subsequently appointed keeper of the pictures, and antiquarian to his majesty. Dalton was sent abroad to purchase works of art for the king, such as Carracci's The Madonna and Sleeping Child with the Infant St John the Baptist, acquired in 1766. At Venice in 1763 he made the acquaintance of Francesco Bartolozzi the engraver, and obtained for him an introduction to England as a rival to Sir Robert Strange, a Jacobite (who accused Dalton of using undue influence with the king, in order to assist Bartolozzi). Dalton was one of the original committee who in 1755 drew up the first project for the establishment of a Royal Academy of Fine Arts in England. He was one of the original members of the Incorporated Society of Artists in 1765, and became their treasurer. He purchased a large house in Pall Mall, to be used as a print warehouse; but as this did not succeed he established there the first nucleus of an academy of arts, under the protection of the king, and induced the St. Martin's Lane Academy to transfer its students and equipment there. Dalton later disposed of the premises to James Christie, who set up as an auctioneer there. Dalton continued to use his influence with the king for the creation of a Royal Academy of Arts, and, when the Royal Academy was really started, he was elected its antiquarian. Dalton died at his rooms in St. James's Palace on 7 February 1791. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1767. Works Dalton was the first Englishman to make drawings of the monuments of ancient art in these countries: some of these he etched and engraved himself. A Selection from the Antiquities of Athens was therefore the first publication of its kind, but it was surpassed by the publications of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett. Dalton published some further sets of engravings of Monuments, Manners, Customs in Turkey and Egypt. Dalton was also the first artist to engrave the series of portraits drawn by Hans Holbein, which had been discovered by Queen Caroline at Kensington Palace. Family Dalton married, on 25 June 1764, Esther, daughter of Abraham Deheulle, a silkweaver of Spitalfields, but left no legitimate issue.

They are likely to have originated in the years before 600, and most evidence for them occurs in sources from or about the 7th century. Regiones were self-sufficient units of mixed subsistence agriculture consisting of scattered settlements producing the range of foodstuffs and other forms of produce necessary to support their population. They formed the defined territories of tribes or similar social groupings and were the building-blocks around which the larger Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were governed. Regiones gradually fragmented in the later Anglo-Saxon period as land was granted into private or ecclesiastical ownership by charter, and the smaller manors that emerged were gradually re-organised for military purposes into hundreds and the larger shires that later evolved into counties. The patterns of obligation that characterised regiones were often retained between successor manors, however, and their traces can be seen in many of the sokes, thanages, liberties, baronies and other administrative and ecclesiastic divisions that characterised later medieval society. Some historians have identified regiones with the concept of the Anglo-Saxon multiple estate. Others have argued that, while similarly organised, multiple estates represent a later stage of territorial organisation, after the concept of folkland or tribal occupation and obligation began to be replaced by that of bookland or documented private ownership. Naming and areas Primary historical sources refer to these areas exclusively in Latin as regiones or provinciae and it is not known what the equivalent contemporary Old English term would have been. Several different terms were used when original Latin texts were later translated, including -ge, which meant \\"district\\" and survived as the second element of the names of several regiones including Eastry and Ely; and meagth, which meant \\"kindred\\", suggesting the areas had tribal origins. In areas of Jutish settlement - such as the Kingdom of Kent and the area around the Solent - regiones often took the name of a topographical element with the Old English suffix \\"-wara\\" meaning \\"-dwellers\\". Examples include the Wihtwara of the Isle of Wight, the Meonwara of the area around the River Meon in south Hampshire, the Limenwara around the River Rother (formerly known as the Limen) in Kent. Similar units with names ending in \\"-ingas\\" meaning \\"people of...\\" can be found in areas of Saxon settlement. Examples in Wessex include the areas of the Readingas, Sunningas and Basingas around Reading, Sonning and Basingstoke. In the Kingdom of Essex examples have been identified including the Berecingas around Barking, the Haeferingas of modern Havering, the Uppingas of Epping and the Hrothingas that occupied the area of the modern Rodings. Examples in areas of Anglian settlement include the Blithingas around Blythburgh in the Kingdom of East Anglia. Many of the smaller areas mentioned in the Tribal Hidage are likely to have been regiones. Within the area of the Kingdom of Northumbria regiones were often named after their central place with the Old English suffix \\"-scƒ´r\\" ‚Äì for example Hallamshire or Hexhamshire ‚Äì which has led historians to refer to them as \\"small shires\\" to distinguish them from the later shires that evolved into the historic counties of England. Origins Various explanations exist for how these territorial units may have formed in the 5th and 6th centuries. The first elements in names ending in -ingas have often been interpreted as personal names, and the territories have often been seen as the areas settled by families or tribes led by those named individuals, or perhaps with them as their earliest known common ancestor. This view sees regiones as the areas of previously autonomous tribal groupings, that retained their identity when absorbed into larger kingdoms in the later 6th and 7th centuries, coming to pay tribute to a king rather than an earlier tribal chieftain. Alternatively regiones may have formed from earlier units based around centres such as hillforts in the aftermath of the end of Roman rule in Britain, subsequently transferred to Anglo-Saxon rulers. Some regiones carry evidence of continuity with earlier Roman or pre-Roman subdivisions, including that of the Brahhingas, which was based around Braughing in modern Hertfordshire, the site of both an earlier Iron Age oppidum and a large Roman town. This would suggest that regiones succeeded the Roman subdivisions of civitates known as pagi. Many small shires have been identified in the area of the south east of modern Scotland that was under Northumbrian control during the early medieval period, but many with identical features have also been identified north of the River Forth in areas that were never under Anglo-Saxon or Roman rule, suggesting that the territories may have even earlier Celtic origins. Structure and role Regiones were characterised by well-defined areas, generally of the order of and often made up of 12 vills. They generally conformed to local topography, occupying a geographically coherent area such as a defined stretch of a river valley. They constituted self-contained and organised economic units of subsistence agriculture including a diverse range of scattered settlements practicing a mix of arable and pastoral farming and sharing common grazing land. Regiones were typically centred upon a royal vill. Anglo-Saxon England lacked the high volume trade in essential foodstuffs necessary to sustain a large royal household in a single location. Royal vills therefore formed a network of halls and accommodation across a kingdom through which a royal household would tour in an itinerary, where each regio would provide food renders to support the royal household and from where the regio and the wider kingdom would be administered. Where they are recorded in charters or by Bede the rulers of regiones are referred to as principes (princes), reguli (kings) or subreguli (sub-kings). Later territorial continuity The regio as a basic territorial unit gradually fragmented during the later Anglo Saxon period as the concept of tribal ownership and organisation declined and was replaced with the concept of private land-holding. The smaller manors that characterise the Domesday Book emerged from within regiones through the endowment of churches with land, the rewarding of officials and the division of a family's land among inheritors. In Kent the areas of the regiones survived as the lathes into which the later county was subdivided. The rapes of Sussex, which similarly each included several hundreds, may also reflect the regiones that made up the earlier Kingdom. Away from those areas traces of earlier regiones can be found where later groups of hundreds contributed to a single royal manor. In 1066 the 19 hundreds of Oxfordshire were annexed in this manner to 7 royal manors that included Headington, Kirtlington and Bensington. In Berkshire and north Hampshire the regio centres of Reading, Sonning and Basingstoke remained centres of distinctive groupings of hundreds throughout the Middle Ages, with the \\"Six hundreds of Basingstoke\\" and the \\"Seven hundreds of Cookham and Bray\\" referred to in medieval records closely resembling the earlier territories of the Basingas and Sunningas. The Surrey hundreds of Chertsey and Woking correspond to the earlier territory of the Woccingas. The defined territories of regiones also formed the basis for later ecclesiastic geography. Conversion to christianity was frequently followed by the establishment of a minster for the tribe, with the boundaries of the tribe's territory frequently defining the minster parishes which the minsters served.

He reigned only briefly, from 942 to 943, from the time of the death of his father Liu Yan (Emperor Gaozu) to the time he was assassinated in a coup headed by his brother Liu Hongxi (later known as Liu Sheng, Emperor Zhongzong).  Background  Liu Hongdu was born in 920, as the third son of Liu Yan, who was then already the emperor of Southern Han (as Emperor Gaozu)‚Äî and therefore, was likely born at Southern Han's capital Xingwang (ËààÁéã, in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong). His mother was Liu Yan's concubine Consort Zhao, who would later receive the title of Zhaoyi (Êò≠ÂÑÄ). (The biographies for her and for Liu Hongdu in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms conflictingly state that she was favored by Liu Yan and that she was not favored by Liu Yan.) The first historical reference to Liu Hongdu was in 932, when Liu Yan created his sons imperial princes‚Äîwith Liu Hongdu receiving the title of Prince of Bin, which was shortly later changed to Prince of Qin. As his older brothers Liu Yaoshu (ÂäâËÄÄÊ®û) and Liu Guitu (ÂäâÈæúÂúñ)‚Äîboth of whom also received princely titles in 932 and therefore were likely still alive thenZizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.‚Äîdied early, Liu Hongdu became the expectant heir as the oldest surviving son of Liu Yan. By 934, Liu Hongdu was the commander of the imperial guard corps, when Liu Yan had him recruiting 1,000 guard soldiers to be loyal to him. Liu Hongdu ended up recruiting many young hoodlums and became close to them. The chancellor Yang Dongqian found this inappropriate and tried to persuade Liu Yan to stop this, but Liu Yan paid no heed to Yang's words, leading to Yang's requesting retirement. (As Yang, in his words to Liu Yan, referred to Liu Hongdu as the heir to the state, it was likely that by this point Liu Yaoshu and Liu Guitu were deceased.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In 942, Liu Yan fell seriously ill. As he had become concerned by this point that both Liu Hongdu and a younger son, Liu Hongxi the Prince of Jin, were arrogant and inappropriate in behavior, he considered sending them out of the capital Xingwang to defend Yong (ÈÇïÂ∑û, in modern Nanning, Guangxi) and Rong (ÂÆπÂ∑û, in modern Yulin, Guangxi) Prefectures respectively, while diverting succession to a younger son, Liu Hongchang the Prince of Yue, whom he considered filially pious, careful, and intelligent. When he consulted the official Xiao Yi (Ëï≠Áõä), however, Xiao argued that passing the throne to a younger son would create disturbances, and so Liu Yan stopped considering that. He soon died, and Liu Hongdu succeeded him as emperor.  Reign  After Liu Hongdu took the throne, he changed his name to Liu Bin. Liu Hongxi became the head of his administration. He honored his mother Consort Zhao as consort dowager. Shortly after Liu Bin took the throne, there was a major agrarian rebellion that rose at Xun Prefecture (Âæ™Â∑û, in modern Huizhou, Guangdong), under the leadership of the local official Zhang Yuxian, who was said to be appointed by an invisible god who spoke in voices. Zhang's rebellion captured many cities, and when Liu Bin sent his brothers Liu Hongchang and Liu Honggao the Prince of Xun to attack Zhang's army, they were surrounded and nearly captured, only saved due to the efforts of the general Chen Daoxiang (Èô≥ÈÅìÂ∫†). Much of the eastern part of the Southern Han state was captured by Zhang. Despite this, it was said that Liu Bin was arrogant and inattentive to the matters of state. Even though he was still within the mourning period for his father Liu Yan, he often drank and played music, and often took prostitutes on night out-of-palace excursions. He also liked watch naked men and women. As those who went against his will were often put to death, few dared to speak to him to correct his behavior, except for Liu Hongchang and the eunuch Wu Huai'en (Âê≥Êá∑ÊÅ©). It was also said that he was suspicious of his brothers, as well as other members of the clan and the officials, such that before they were to enter the palace to see him, they were first strip-searched before they could enter. Liu Hongxi, who was ambitious and had designs on the throne, decided to encourage his frivolous behavior, and therefore offered much jewelry, decorations, and women to him. As Liu Bin liked arm wrestling, Liu Hongxi also had Chen train a group of five strong men‚ÄîLiu Sichao (ÂäâÊÄùÊΩÆ), Tan Lingyin (Ë≠ö‰ª§Á¶ã), Lin Shaoqiang (ÊûóÂ∞ëÂº∑), Lin Shaoliang (ÊûóÂ∞ëËâØ), and He Changting (‰ΩïÊòåÂª∑)‚Äîto be arm wrestlers, which Liu Bin was pleased about. On April 15, 943, Liu Bin held a feast for the imperial princes at Changchun Palace, and there were arm wrestling matches that they watched there. The feast ended when Liu Bin fell extremely drunk. Liu Hongxi had Chen and the arm wrestlers that he trained carry Liu Bin back to his bedchambers, and had him pounded to death there. His attendants were slaughtered. The next morning, initially, the officials and the princes, realizing that something was wrong, did not dare to enter the palace. Eventually, Liu Hongchang led the other brothers in a display of support for Liu Hongxi to take the throne, which Liu Hongxi did.

S. ureae is an aerobic, motile, spore- forming, Gram-positive coccus, originally isolated in the early 20th century from soil. S. ureae is distinguished by its ability to grow in relatively high concentrations of urea through production of at least one exourease, an enzyme that converts urea to ammonia. S. ureae has also been found to sporulate when environmental conditions become unfavorable, and can remain viable for up to a year . History In the early 20th century, famous Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck isolated a microorganism that he named Planosarcina ureae. In an effort to isolate bacteria from urea-containing soil enrichments, he repeatedly came across a motile coccus that clustered in packets and had the ability to form endospores. The isolated organism‚Äôs nomenclature changed often as the result of the morphological and biochemical observations done by early researchers. In 1911, Lohnis proposed that the organism should be called Sarcina ureae because of the cluster packets the organism formed in culture. In the 1960s, researchers MacDonald and MacDonald along with Kocur and Martinec moved Sarcina ureae to the genus Sporosarcina (proposed by Orla- Jensen in 1909 and first used by Kluyver and van Neil in 1936). Later in 1973, Pregerson isolated over 50 different strains of S. ureae from numerous soil samples around the world, finding that the organism is most commonly present in soils that reflected high activities of dogs and humans.  Characteristics  The cells are coccoid. Cells are 1-2.5 Œºm. Cell division is carried out in two or three successive planes, such that tetrads or packets of eight or more cells are formed. S. ureae forms endospores (like all species of the genus). The endospores are 0.5-1.5 Œºm. The species can move using a flagellum.  Metabolism  S. ureae is heterotrophic, as it does not perform photosynthesis. Its metabolism is due to cellular respiration. The species is strictly aerobic, as it needs oxygen. The optimal pH for growth is 7. The optimal temperature for growth is 25 ¬∞C. Growth under oxygen exclusion does not occur. The oxidase test is positive.  Ecology  S. ureae is one of the bacteria that can make use of urea with the enzyme urease. It is often found in soil, and forms the highest population densities in soils exposed to large amounts of urine, for example, cow pastures. Through plating serial dilutions of soil, both Gibson and Pregerson found that a gram of soil could contain up to 10,000 S. ureae organisms. S. ureae probably plays an important role in the degradation of urine. It is also found in manure and tolerates a pH of 9-10. Isolation Over the years, several methods have been developed to isolate and maintain cultures of S. ureae. In 1935, Gibson used standard nutrient agar supplemented with 3-5% urea to inhibit most other soil organisms that would otherwise outcompete S. ureae. Pregerson‚Äôs (1973) isolation technique was similar, but she used tryptic soy yeast agar (27.5 g Difco tryptic soy broth, 5.0 g Difco yeast extract, 15.0 g Difco agar, 1 liter of water) supplemented with 1% urea and incubated serial dilutions of soil samples at a cooler 22 ¬∞C. Omitting the urea provides an effective maintenance medium.  Etymology  The genus name derives from the Greek word spora (\\"spore\\") and the Latin word sarcina (\\"package\\", \\"bundle\\") and refers to the fact that it forms endospores and the typical arrangement of the cells. The species name derives from the ability of this species to break down urea. Genetics and phylogeny Currently, only a draft genome of S. ureae exists. Automated annotation server RAST (rast.nmpdr.org) reveals specific genes involved in stress response, cell wall and capsule, and household genes, among others. Claus et al. (1983) determined the GC content of S.ureae to be 40.6-40.8%. S. ureae is closely related to other spore-forming organisms of the genus Bacillus, an observation first noted by Beijerinck in 1903. Fox et. Al (1977) showed that S. ureae is most closely related to B. pasteurii. Biotechnological applications Recently interest in S. ureae has increased due to the potential biotechnological applications; however, research has nearly been exclusively focused on the unique outer cell surface layer (S-layer). S-layers are composed of single proteins that form a predictable lattice structure and have potential applications in nanoelectronics, medicine, and biosensors. An example of this research is the S-layer‚Äôs promising role in enzyme immobilization. The process of artificially breaking down certain metabolites and poisons is often slowed by the proximity of the required enzymes needed to one another. However, if one were able to use the S. ureae S-layer, all the required enzymes needed to metabolize a specific poison could be bound together, thus dramatically increasing rate of the reactions. Furthermore, much of the research is looking into the self-assembly property of S-layers which, when bound to certain antibodies, has the ability to advance the vaccine development. Studies are also looking its role in certain pathogens, such as B. anthracis, where it is implicated in cellular attachment. Other important areas of this research can be seen in some of the current work being done at the Ames Research Center (NASA), looking at organisms that convert urea to ammonium. A presentation by Lynn Rothschild (Horizon Lectures, Sept. 2012) indicated some of the first colonizers of Mars might use these organisms to convert human waste to ammonium and subsequently use the ammonium to lower the pH of the Mars soils to make calcium carbonate cement. This cement could then be used to make bricks and other building materials. The ability for S.ureae to convert urea to ammonia has important potential applications in the production of biofuels and fertilizers. Ammonia is currently being actively researched as a carbon-alternative fuel source. The high octane rating (110-130) and its relative safety when compared to gasoline make it an ideal replacement for current gasoline. Traditional methods of generating ammonia for fertilizer rely heavily on the use of natural gas; in fact, to produce the ammonia needed for current fertilizer demands accounts for an estimated 2% of the entire world‚Äôs energy consumption.

Definition Mesotherms have two basic characteristics: # Elevation of body temperature via metabolic production of heat. # Weak or absent metabolic control of a particular body temperature. The first trait distinguishes mesotherms from ectotherms, the second from endotherms. For instance, endotherms, when cold, will generally resort to shivering or metabolizing brown fat to maintain a constant body temperature, leading to higher metabolic rates. A mesotherm, however, will experience lower body temperatures and lower metabolic rates as ambient temperature drop. In addition, mesotherm body temperatures tend to rise as body size increases (a phenomenon known as gigantothermy), unlike endotherms. This reflects the lower surface area to volume ratio in large animals, which reduces rates of heat loss. While extant mesotherms are relatively rare, good examples include tuna, lamnid sharks (e.g., the great white shark), the leatherback sea turtle, some species of bee,Temperature regulation (bumblebees are warm-blooded insects), naked mole rats, the hyrax, and the various monotremes. Historically, the same term was used by Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle to describe plants that require a moderate degree of heat for successful growth. In his scheme, a mesotherm plant grew in regions where the warmest month had a mean temperature greater than and the coldest month had a mean temperature of at least .  Dinosaur thermoregulation  The thermoregulatory status of dinosaurs has long been debated, and is still an active area of research. The term 'mesothermy' was originally coined to advocate for an intermediate status of non-avian dinosaur thermoregulation, between endotherms and ectotherms. A more technical definition was provided by Grady et al, who argued for dinosaur mesothermy on the basis of their intermediate growth rates, and the empirical relationship between growth, metabolism and thermoregulation in extant vertebrates. This viewpoint was challenged by D'Emic, who argued that because growth rates are sensitive to seasonal variation in resources, dinosaur maximum growth rates were underestimated by Grady et al. Adjusting dinosaur rates upwards by a factor of two, D'Emic found dinosaurs to grow similarly to mammals, and thus were likely endothermic. However, sensitivity to seasonal variation in resources should be true for all vertebrates. If all vertebrate taxa were similarly adjusted, the relative differences in rates does not change. Dinosaurs remain intermediate growers and good candidates for mesothermy. Nonetheless, the dinosaur mesothermy hypothesis requires further support to be confirmed. Fossil oxygen isotopes, which can reveal an organism's body temperature, should be particularly informative. Recently, a study of theropod and sauropod isotopes offered some support for dinosaur mesothermy. Feathered theropods are probably the best candidates for dinosaur endothermy, yet the examined theropods had relatively low body temperatures . Large sauropods had higher body temperatures , which may be reflective of mesothermic gigantothermy. Future isotopic analysis of small, juvenile dinosaurs will better resolve this question.

Retrieved 15 June 2014. There are seven townlands in the parish. There are no large centres of population in the parish. Donadea is noted for its public forest park which is one of the most popular outdoor venues in county Kildare. The nearest villages are Staplestown (4km distant) and Prosperous (7km distant). The parish name is derived from a church, traditionally said to have been founded by Saint Patrick. A small 17th-century church of the Church of Ireland, St Peter's, still exists within the Donadea demense.  Townlands  The following are the townlands: Cooltrim North, Cooltrim South, Donadea, Donadea Demesne, Kilmurry, Kilnamoragh North, Gilltown and Kilnamoragh South.  Demense  The Normans came to Donadea in the 12th century and established a manor. The manor house was built on or close to the present castle. This structure was the first of many castles on the site throughout the Middle Ages. In 1558 the Aylmer family acquired the manor. In 1581, Gerald Aylmer commenced a new tower in Donadea which was not completed until 1624. It is now the oldest part of the Castle. In 1626, he repaired the medieval church. Gerald was ennobled as the first Baronet of Donadea. Seamus Cullen, The History of Donadea Demesne, 2009  Ecclesiastical parish  St Peter's Church, Donadea demense. The Book of Armagh records St Patrick‚Äôs visit to Dunmurraghill in 455, where he marked out the foundations for a religious settlement. The St. Peter‚Äôs site was laid out at the same time. The earliest churches were wooden in construction. The Danes destroyed Dunmurraghill in 832. The church at the St. Peter‚Äôs site was rebuilt by the Normans. In 1550 the Aylmer family of Lyons acquired the Manor of Donadea from the Earls of Ormond. In 1626 the first Aylmer baronet, Sir Gerald Aylmer, rebuilt the church. The Ecclesiastical Report of 1809 stated that: \\"the Church was in a tottering state but neat and clean.\\".

It was part of the old Aylmer family estate. The last of the Aylmers, Miss Caroline died in 1935 leaving the property to the Church of Ireland, who in turn sold it to the State. There are many historical features including the remains of the castle, walled gardens, church, tower, ice house, boat house and Lime Tree Avenue. There is also a lake with ducks and other birds and a wonderful display of water-lilies in the summer. Walled streams form part of the drainage of the park. There are many different walks through the forest, including the 5km Aylmer loop, the lake walk (wheelchair accessible) and a nature trail with stops. A small caf√© serves light refreshments and is open year round. The park is a designated National Heritage Area. There is a \\"9/11\\" Memorial at Donadea. The memorial was inspired by the memory of Sean Tallon, a young fire fighter, whose family had emigrated from Donadea.

H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, e.g. 178, 596-98. H√∂sle defends ethical universalism and many recent achievements of the modern state, such as \\"the international codification of human rights.\\" He also argues that the foundation of the worldview which supports human rights is \\"eroding with increasing speed,\\" and therefore the political cataclysms of the twentieth century are by no means \\"merely superficial phenomena that ultimately belong to the past.\\"H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, 59. H√∂sle challenges certain modern excesses, such as the loss of a transcendent horizon of consciousness,H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, 588-98. He argues that an excessive focus on economic growth and ever- expanding consumption has increased perceived needs more quickly than it can meet them,H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, xiv, 665; see also 715. which leads to self-absorption and lovelessness,H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, 179, 279. and a demand for more resources ecologically than can be sustained for future generations or universalized to all the people of the world.H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, e.g. xii, 481-82, 602-18, 878-81. H√∂sle considers the modern state's (classical) liberal capitalism, as qualified by the late-modern welfare state, a significant moral achievement due to its highly efficient production and distribution of goods.H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, 54-55. H√∂sle argues these moral reasons to limit moralism in economics, that John Rawls's difference principle cannot be unconditionally valid in economics, and that the technical expertise of economists is a necessary component in determining the proper means of preventing excessively large social oppositions from arising.Cf. H√∂sle, Morals and Politics, 54-55, 110-11, 665-69.  Philosophical work  H√∂sle's own philosophy combines \\"objective idealism\\" with a theory of intersubjectivity. In this way he seeks to unite the traditional idealistic philosophy of Plato and Hegel with the transcendental pragmatics developed by Karl-Otto Apel. H√∂sle describes himself as attempting to revitalize \\"objective idealism\\": \\"The conviction that we can have synthetic a priori knowledge, and that this knowledge discovers something that is independent of our mind, is of particular importance for practical philosophy. It grounds the position called ‚Äòmoral realism‚Äô: Albeit the moral law is neither a physical nor a mental nor a social fact, it is nevertheless; it belongs to an ideal sphere of being that partly determines the structures of real (physical, mental, social) being.\\"H√∂sle, Objective Idealism, Ethics and Politics (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998), Preface, vii. H√∂sle believes that his approach runs counter to the dominant trends of Western philosophy following the rise of post-Hegelian philosophy in the 1830s, and especially amid \\"that ultra- critical thinking which‚Ä¶has swept over Europe like a great wave\\" beginning in the 1960s.H√∂sle, \\"Foundational Issues of Objective Idealism,\\" in Objective Idealism, Ethics and Politics, 1-5. A useful introduction to the many grounds on which H√∂sle criticizes the often-unchallenged relativistic assumptions of our time is provided in \\"Foundational Issues of Objective Idealism,\\" the opening essay of Objective Idealism, Ethics and Politics (1998). He establishes his positive position largely through reflexive or transcendental reasoning‚Äîthat is, reflections upon the necessary presuppositions of all reason and speech. While the theoretical alternative H√∂sle provides is largely Platonic and Hegelian, his practical philosophy could be described as a modified Kantianism, and is developed in the same volume's second essay: \\"The Greatness and Limits of Kant's Practical Philosophy.\\" There H√∂sle argues that the autonomous, rationalist, and universalist positions of Kant, based on the synthetic a priori, remain unsurpassed and indispensable achievements. However, H√∂sle does grant that Kant was mistaken in neglecting the need to cultivate the emotions, as well as in his overly formalist approach, which neglects the need for concrete knowledge of circumstances and wrongly denies the possibility of morally compelling exceptions to objective moral rules.H√∂sle, \\"The Greatness and Limits of Kant's Practical Philosophy,\\" in Objective Idealism, Ethics and Politics, esp. 41-44, 48-57.

Following the commercial success of its predecessor, Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan), Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi was given the previous game's development team. Inspired by Super Mario 64, the team set out to create a 3D game that ultimately exceeded the capabilities of the platform. Along the way, the team changed its console focus from the Super Famicom to the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD floppy drive peripheral, for which the game was expected to be a 1998 launch game. Upon the commercial failure of the 64DD, the game was converted to cartridge plus expansion disk. Itoi developed the game's concept during Mother 2s development and built a 12-chapter story with player-characters that rotated between chapters. Having been a producer during Mother 2, Itoi served as a scriptwriter during Mother 3s development. A North American version was announced as EarthBound 64, but did not materialize when the 60 percent- complete Japanese release was canceled in August 2000 in reprioritization leading up to Project Dolphin (the code name of the GameCube). At the time, the game was estimated to need another two years of work. After multiple years and failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story and received a graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human psychology, renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan. Nintendo 64 The game was designed for the 64DD peripheral, shown here as docked beneath the Nintendo 64. Mother 3 was originally developed for the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) beginning in 1994. Shigeru Miyamoto, head of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development and Mother 3 producer, said that Mother 3 was \\"a commercial decision\\", since Mother 2 (EarthBound outside Japan) had sold well. By this point, Mother series creator Shigesato Itoi had worked on the series' earlier games and Itoi Shigesato no Bass Tsuri No. 1 and was experienced at pitching video games, so Miyamoto provided a team willingly. The Mother 2 development team carried over to the new game's development, though several people left and the team grew in size. They forwent the usual prototyping phase and went straight into development expecting to create something unprecedented. Itoi said he wanted to make the game like a Hollywood film. In September 1994, he predicted that Mother 3s development would end around 1996 with a release on Nintendo's then-upcoming console. The team was inspired by Super Mario 64 and decided that they too could creatively flourish by making a 3D open world. Their early technical specifications exceeded the capabilities and memory limits of the platform. About halfway through development, the team attempted to scale back its large scope and changed its target from cartridge to the 64DD floppy drive peripheral. At E3 in June 1997, Miyamoto speculated that Mother 3 would be one of the four games for the then-expected 1998 launch of the Japan-only peripheral. The EarthBound fan community anticipated a sequel, and a North American release of Mother 3 was announced as EarthBound 64. Nintendo displayed a playable version of the game at its Space World 1999 trade show, where IGN described the development's progress as \\"very far along\\" and half complete. Having followed a period of media silence, the announcement there of its conversion from 64DD disk to cartridge plus mission expansion disk was taken by IGN as a sign of further delay or cancellation of the 64DD altogether. In April 2000, IGN estimated the game's development as \\"safe to assume that the game is nearing its final stages of completion\\". The company struggled to find a firm release date, and was expected to release in Japan before a North American version would be considered. At the time, the 64DD was only released in Japan. Nintendo did not show the game at the 2000 Electronic Entertainment Expo, though IGN expected to see a finished version of the game at Space World 2000. Mother producer Satoru Iwata canceled the game altogether prior to Space World 2000, as announced by Itoi on August 20, 2000. Iwata clarified that the franchise was not abandoned but that the game would no longer be developed for the Nintendo 64, and Miyamoto added that it was not due to project complications or development hell, but to resources needed for Project Dolphin (the GameCube). Some of the artists had been on the project for over three years. They estimated the project to be about 60 percent complete at the time of cancellation‚Äîthe basics were complete and only programming was left. About 30 percent of the final product was completed. Itoi estimated that it would have taken an additional two years to finish properly, and Iwata said that the game might have been finished by 2000 had the scope been reduced two years earlier. Miyamoto was involved in other work and spent little time on-site with the project, and Iwata too was distracted by bankruptcy concerns at HAL Labs and was off-site in 1999 due to circumstances that required travel. Iwata was also hospitalized during production for stress-related reasons. The team intended to have the game finished by the end of 1999 and knew they had to reconsider their priorities when they missed the milestone. They said that the Mother 3 supervisors had wanted to cancel the project since 1999, but later changed sides and said that cancellation would be wasteful. They discussed bringing the game to their forthcoming GameCube, which Miyamoto said would have solved some of the Nintendo 64's hardware issues. Miyamoto and Iwata also discussed releasing the game on the Game Boy Advance, but realized that it would take \\"just as much time\\" with 40 to 50 staff members to make such a game. In retrospect, Iwata wondered out loud in an interview why the game needed to be in 3D when Itoi's \\"greatest talent lies in words\\" and thought that the energy poured into making a 3D game might have been a poor choice. He said he was \\"genuinely ashamed\\", and acknowledged that they were both \\"caught up in the 3D obsession and felt obligated\\" at the time. At the time of its cancellation, Itoi predicted that Mother 3 would remain a story that only the game's staff would know, though he also expressed an interest in making the story into a novel or kamishibai if he had the time. Miyamoto was still interested in bringing the game to fruition. =Design= Flint within an inn, as compared between the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance versions of Mother 3 Itoi conceived the premise of Mother 3 towards the end of Mother 2s production. He called another person on the project to describe a \\"detective story where the city was the main character\\". He envisioned a hack, small-time, womanizing private investigator who would become engrossed in a big murder case, and the story would unfold from a young female clerk at a flower shop who would slowly recall parts of a story consequential to the plot. Thus, the city would appear to grow. This idea of a \\"single place changing over time\\" was central to Mother 3. He saw previous RPGs as \\"road movies\\" with little reason for the hero to backtrack to previous areas, and instead wanted the player to see the town gossip grow dynamically. Miyamoto and Itoi compared this type of progression to the story of Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game was enough of a departure from the series that the development team questioned whether fans would consider it part of the series. Itoi originally intended the game to have 12 chapters with varied game mechanics; for example, one with classic role-playing game mechanics and another as just cutscenes. He conceptualized the process as designing 3D \\"puppets\\" that could then be easily moved around the \\"stage\\". In actuality, each custom scene required special programming. The player- character changed between each chapter‚Äîa concept they first attempted in their previous game‚Äîso as to see multiple characters grow. As development wore on, Itoi offered to compromise by replacing full chapters with sequences of still images and text. They cut the total chapters to seven or nine by the time it was canceled. Itoi described the story as \\"normal\\" for its first half, leading up to a \\"triple-play twist\\". One of the game's themes was the reckless appearance and \\"uncomfortable beauty\\" of chimera‚Äîmultiple creatures fused into one‚Äîwhich was the idea behind the metallic and wooden Mother 3 logo. Itoi has said of his role in the Mother series that he wanted to be more of a team member and scriptwriter and less of a manager in Mother 3s development. He saw himself as simultaneously making the game he wanted to play and setting traps for the player, and as making a game Nintendo could not. The Mother 3 logo was made from a fusion of metal and trees, which Itoi interpreted as an \\"uncomfortable beauty\\" from two materials that were impossible to fuse. This is also a theme in his only novel. The chimeras theme informed the game's original subtitle: \\"Forest of the Chimeras\\". Itoi compared the reckless appearance of chimeras to the mutilated toys of Sid from Toy Story. The subtitle eventually became \\"The End of the Pig King\\" before the game was canceled and the final release has no subtitle because Itoi did not want to lead the player's interpretation. The game was set to continue 10 years after the first Mother. The player-character, Flint, was a cowboy in the vein of Clint Eastwood with two boys, Lucca and Klaus (later becoming Lucas and Claus), and a dog, Boney. The game was to include over 10 playable characters and span 10 years in its story based around the Pig army, which attempts to use \\"primitive machinery ... to enslave mankind\\". At Space World 1999, IGN sampled environments including a hovercraft in a desert canyon, a snake dungeon, a cutscene with a bullet train, a town with non-player characters, and a mine cart scene, through themes including fantasy, the medieval, and science fiction. Physical contact with an enemy in the overworld triggered a turn-based battle scene shown in the first-person (similar to EarthBound). The battles had psychedelic backgrounds and a circular menu that included a command to \\"get up\\" if the player was knocked down in a real-time sequence. Attacks could be timed with the in-game music for stronger effects. The developers also planned multiple routes for advancing through the game and unforeseen complications from minor actions, such as a monster finding food dropped in the forest. The game was set to include features such as synching the game's time with the real time, but those features required the 64DD. Mother 3 was set to run between 40 and 60 hours in length. =Reception= IGN was impressed by the mine cart sequence shown at Space World 1999. In its review of the Space World 1999 demo, IGN found the mine cart scene‚Äîwhere Lucca and Klaus outrun a collapsing cave in a minecart‚Äîto be its \\"most impressive\\" sequence. They added that it \\"might be one of the most impressive cutscenes on the N64 yet\\". IGN said that the controls were intuitive, the sound \\"well orchestrated and memorable\\", the 3D game engine \\"strong\\", and the battle system \\"confusing\\". They wrote that the game would be highly original, but were not able to tell the degree to which the story or characters would interact. IGN compared the multi-character aspect of the narrative to the Japan-only Super Famicom RPG Live A Live. Famitsu readers ranked the game as one of their top ten most anticipated towards the end of 1999. Game Boy Advance \\"We're making Mother 3 for the GBA too! Dakota!\\" Mother 3 is announced at the end of the 2003 Mother 1+2 advertisement Three years later, in 2003, a Japanese Mother 1+2 television advertisement includes a slide announcing a future release of Mother 3. While working on the compilation that would port Mother and Mother 2 to the Game Boy Advance, Itoi predicted further pressure to release Mother 3 and decided, based on encouragement from several failed fan petitions, to release the game. Itoi had earlier assumed that restarting the project was impossible, and said that his final effort to finish the game to be more like a \\"prayer\\" than like \\"vengeance\\". Other than the graphical changes required for a release on the Advance, the game was to keep its original story. Brownie Brown staff assisted in the game's development, and Itoi worked with them on individual pacing issues. Itoi chose to use the pixelated style of Mother 2 for Mother 3 because he was uninterested in computer graphics trends. He said that it was only coincidentally related to the resurgence of interest in retrogaming. The series' games were written in the hiragana alphabet instead of in kanji (Chinese characters) so as to remain accessible to young children. Itoi described the world as governed by \\"might equals right\\" and its power struggle as \\"macho\\". The antagonist, Porky, was designed as a \\"symbol of humankind\\". Itoi associated the game's view of evil to the \\"fun and games\\" on the spectrum of \\"pranks\\" to \\"crimes\\", and likened its tone to the lyrics of the song \\"Reunion\\" by Kazuko Matsuo, where the subject falls in love with someone the world finds evil. Itoi compared how the characters come to realize their psychic powers with menstruation, and added that human physiology was \\"one of his themes\\". As such, players sweat when learning an ability, based on Itoi's belief of how physical struggle facilitates growth. He also included characters like the Magypsies and Duster (who has a bad leg) to show the value of having friends with different qualities. Some environments were added to serve specific purposes. For example, Osohe Castle was meant to show the scale of time and Tantane Island was designed to reflect the player's worst nightmares as similar to Mother 2s \\"hallucinatory city\\", Moonside. Another of his themes is the duality of the seriousness and lightheartedness of games, which is why he added a serious death scene to the first chapter. Parts of the game reference outside media such as Kiki's Delivery Service, a film by Studio Ghibli, a company for which Itoi had written film taglines and had voiced the father in My Neighbor Totoro. Itoi wrote the game's ending while overseas in Saipan before Mother 3 was canceled. His Nintendo 64 version was darker, \\"dirtier\\", and more upsetting, though the final version changed little in concept. The Nintendo 64 version was to be more vague and left to the player's imagination through its sparse dialogue. Itoi attributed the change in tone to his own growth and the character composition of the new development team. He said that he had not been changed by fans. Itoi always planned for the two brothers to fight each other, though he did not write the ending until after production had already begun, a process he compared with Hayao Miyazaki's. Itoi processed each line individually as he wrote the final scene, and later reflected on its moral content that bad people sometimes need even more help than the good people. He said that the one line that makes him most emotional is, \\"You must be tired.\\" Itoi said that the ending's renewal theme reflected his worldview of appreciating our time on Earth in light of the planet's inevitable end. Much of the rest of the script was written after-hours at a local hotel where they would continue their work. By July 2004, the game was about 60 percent finished and was set for a late 2005 release in Japan. The game was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan for the Game Boy Advance, whereupon it became a bestseller. A limited edition Deluxe Box Set was produced with a special edition Game Boy Micro and Franklin Badge pin. It did not receive a North American release on the basis that it would not sell well. Digital Trends wrote that the game's emphasis on \\"magical transgender gurus\\" might have also affected the decision. =Music= Mother 3s development spanned four consoles, but eventually released for the handheld Game Boy Advance. All of the game's music was composed by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi had to choose a composer from the development team who understood the series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who was outside the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series. There are 250 tracks in the game's sound player. Itoi did not have a favorite of Sakai's work. He noted that the final track, \\"Love Theme\\", was added towards the end of the development cycle. While the ending was incomplete, Itoi planned to use the Pigmask theme, but they decided to add a new song to better reflect their intentions in December 2005. The game's soundtrack was released on compact disc on November 2, 2006. Kyle Miller of RPGFan wrote that the game retained the quirkiness of the previous soundtracks in the series though switching composers. He found the second half of the album, which included reinterpreted \\"classics\\" from the series, to be its strongest.

The Mother 3 fan translation is a complete English-language localization of the 2006 Japanese video game Mother 3 by members of the EarthBound fan community led by Clyde \\"Tomato\\" Mandelin. The original game was released in Japan after a decade of development hell. When fan interest in an English localization went unanswered, members of the EarthBound fansite Starmen.net announced their own fan translation in November 2006. The dozen fans who worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior localization experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The completed version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional- quality player's guide was released alongside the translation.  Fan community  After a decade of \\"delays, downgrades, and cancellations\\", Mother 3 was released in April 2006 for Japanese audiences. It is the Game Boy Advance sequel to the 1995 Super NES video game EarthBound, titled Mother 2 in Japan. The American EarthBound fan community, in support of the series, had rallied support via events and petitions for the release. One such petition used custom petition software and hand-checked name verification, and the 819 pages of 31,000 signatures were sent to Nintendo's Japanese and American offices with fan art. Though receiving the backing of the wider gaming community, Nintendo did not respond. In turn, the new release became a \\"rallying point\\" for the community. 1UP.com wrote that \\"no other game in the history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation\\". The fan community did not expect an official English localization when Mother 3 was released in April 2006. Four months later, they received news that Nintendo was not interested, and in November, received confirmation in an interview with Nintendo of America's \\"Treehouse\\" localization group. Within days, the fan translation was announced at EarthBound community site Starmen.net. Reid Young, a co-founder of the site, said that a fan translation \\"was as much about the fans as it was about the game\\".  Development  The Mother 3 fan translation project was announced in November 2006. Led by Clyde \\"Tomato\\" Mandelin, a professional game translator whose previous work includes games such as Kingdom Hearts II and anime such as Dragon Ball, a group of around a dozen individuals translated the game from Japanese to English in a process that took two years and thousands of work-hours. Those who worked on the localization were largely already known for their contributions to other fan translations, and Tomato's own experience in the fan translation community helped the project get the necessary resources. Tomato worked on the project as \\"a second full-time job\\" in addition to his full-time job as a translator. Young, who did public relations for the project and had little involvement in the process, estimated Tomato to have put over 1,000 hours into the project, Jeffman to have nearly 1,000, and even the smallest contributors to have put between 50 and 100 hours into the project, though no one tracked hours. The team chose to not alter the game aside for adding a new intro screen, which meant not adding their names to the credits. The localization included two elements: hacking the game data (ROM) and translating the scripted dialogue. The ROM hacking entailed assembly-level changes to the game code. Young equated the process to teaching someone another language by slowly altering their DNA bit by bit, through trial and error. Some of the technical changes included proportional fonts, graphics hacks, and custom software. The game was coded in such a way that there was not enough system memory available to display the requisite onscreen text. Since Japanese characters all occupy the same amount of space (monospaced), the team had to custom-code the new English characters to fit properly. Tomato said that \\"no text display routine wound up untouched\\", such that the fixes for variable width fonts were useless until the team manually made room for the characters. Graphics hacks included the new intro screen and images imported from the English EarthBound, so as to preserve continuity of features. For example, an octopus statue pun from Mother 2 was converted to a pencil statue in the EarthBound English localization and was changed accordingly in the Mother 3 localization. The team also built custom software to aid in the translation, such as a cross- assembler and tools for handling the script and patching. Members of the hacking team included Tomato, Jeffman, byuu, and sblur. About 1,000 pages of text were translated, which Young described as large by most standards, including that of other RPGs. They estimated the theoretical freelance cost of the translation at $30,000. Young described Tomato as a perfectionist, and said that he kept the translation team small so as not to bog down progress, though he did request group input for aspects such as pun translation, where more input was seen to be helpful. Translation decisions included renaming the character Yokuba (similar to the Japanese word for \\"greed\\") to Fassad (similar to the Arabic word ŸÅÿ≥ÿßÿØ, \\"corruption\\", and to the English word \\"facade\\"), and changing mice characters from a Japanese dialect to a thick Cockney English dialect. The team reported that \\"the highest levels\\" of Nintendo of America knew about their project, though they did not intervene. In February 2007, Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said that he had heard about the translation project. Young said that their localization team transparently stated that they would curb the project if the company were to make an announcement about the future of the game. Though the team acknowledged that the legality of the localization was unclear, Young said that it would not be reasonable to call the fan translation \\"impetuous or unfair\\". The team added that they were against software piracy. They directed others to import the game from Japan or otherwise purchase official merchandise when the game left publication, with the ultimate aim to help the franchise. Tomato received encouragement from a Square Enix employee who anticipated the translation. At the end of the project, the team said that the fan translation would lead to more protection against fan translations rather than more encouragement, so as to maximize the underserved audience. Tomato said that he was unable to appreciate his work since it was so familiar to him, with every original and translated line memorized. He expected that would change in five years. The project gave Tomato a greater respect for the craft of writing.  Release  The localization patch was finished in October 2008. Though Tomato predicted the game to have \\"a couple dozen thousand downloads total\\", it was downloaded more than 100,000 times in its first week, not including downloads from other locations. The patch requires a ROM image file of the game to be used. Along with the translation, the team announced the Mother 3 Handbook, an English player's guide for the game that had been in development since June 2008. Wired reported the full-color, 200-page player's guide to be akin to a professional strategy guide, with quality \\"on par with ... Prima Games and BradyGames\\". Tomato released updated versions of the patch in 2009 and 2014. The patch is undergoing translation into languages including French, Italian, and Spanish, with translation tools released in 2014.  Reception  Frank Caron of Ars Technica wrote that the \\"massive undertaking ... stands as a massive success\\" and that the fan translation realized the dreams of many gamers including his own. He added that \\"one cannot even begin to fathom\\" why Nintendo would not release their own English localization. Kotakus Mike Fahey wrote that the translators were wrong to suggest purchasing official merchandise where players were unable to find an import copy. The Verge cited the two-year fan translation of Mother 3 as proof of the fanbase's dedication.

It was released on Seeland Records on April 15, 2003. Legal controversy The album's fifth track, \\"Rocked by Rape\\", which combines clips from Dan Rather's television news broadcasts with AC/DC's song Back in Black, attracted considerable attention, both positive and negative. The song was originally released as a single in 1999, after which Spin gave it a provocative and favorable review, describing it as \\"a wicked language poem, backed by an endless AC/DC drone.\\" It was also reviewed favorably by CMJ's Douglas Wolk, who praised it as a \\"stroke of genius\\". CBS later sent a cease-and-desist letter to Gunderson accusing him of copyright infringement in producing \\"Rocked by Rape\\", to which he replied that the song was a parody and therefore compliant with US copyright law. In spite of CBS attempting to limit the song's popularity with their letter to Gunderson, the song became considerably more popular than it previously was, with the song being played by NPR's All Things Considered program in 2000. Also in 2000, ECC themselves posted copies of the song online, disguising them to look like unreleased tracks by famous artists. Critical reception Plagiarhythm Nation received mixed reviews from critics. Sean Carruthers of AllMusic gave it four out of five stars and described it generally favorably, likening it to a greatest-hits collection; but he also wrote that \\"There are a few rough patches,\\" citing \\"Fearsome as Odd Danger\\" and \\"Nasha\\" as examples. Robert Christgau gave the album a \\"choice cut\\" rating (which corresponds to a bad album with one or more good songs), identifying \\"The Fucking Moon\\" and \\"Rocked by Rape\\" as the only good songs on the album. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B grade and wrote that it \\"turns garage-sale detritus, voice-mail jabber, and pop shrapnel into a musical comedy record where the absurd and the sophomoric duke it out.\\" Track listing # Star Spangled Bologna 1:18 # The Fucking Moon 1:57 # Hello 0:16 # I Want A Cookie 3:40 # Rocked By Rape 4:28 # Spandau Filet 1:31 # Don't Miss The Great Snatch 4:19 # Breakfast 0:43 # Donations #1 1:35 # Toot 0:30 # Nearly No Time For Yes 0:44 # No Time For Yes 3:04 # Lunch 0:45 # Donations #2 1:28 # 5000 Bc 0:37 # Arrhythmic Nation 1:19 # The Big Noodle Song 0:38 # Prick 0:18 # Sex Re- Education 2:21 # Dinner 1:00 # Donations #3 1:23 # Candy Wrapper 1:36 # Fearsome As Odd Danger 7:30 # Arrhythmia's Gonna Get You 0:59 # I Don't Care 1:21 # Nasha 5:08 # Dedication 0:08 # The Christmas Wrong 1:31 # Goodbye 0:10 References Category:Seeland Records albums Category:2003 albums ","title":"Plagiarhythm Nation"},{"id":"43063097","text":"General George Campbell of Inverneill, C.B., K.A (1803‚Äì1882) was Commandant of the Royal Artillery and served in the East India Company.

The line, for the most part, is double-track, with the only area of single track between CP Blandon and CP West Laurel. Trains go faster on this line than most others. History The line opened as the East Pennsylvania Railroad on May 11, 1859, connecting Allentown with Reading. This railroad became part of the Reading Railroad, and carried traffic from the Allentown area to their main line. In 1976, The Reading Railroad was acquired by Conrail, which continued to use the line as a conduit between North Jersey and the rest of the country. When Conrail was split in 1999, Norfolk Southern was assigned the line. On March 14, 2018, Norfolk Southern increased speeds along the Reading Line from to at 33 grade crossings and from to at 3 grade crossings.

During the digging process, organic artifacts had been stabilized in blocks of ice: both in Jerry Mackey's restaurant freezers and freezers installed in storage units in caves near the Missouri River. In the three months following the dig, larger wooden artifacts, including the stern, paddle wheel, and two prefabricated houses found on board, were submerged in an 80-by-20-foot pool specially dug by the team. Greg Hawley partnered with conservators working on the Mary Rose Trust in Portsmouth, England, and the Canadian Conservation Institute in Ottawa, along with the Historical Resource Conservation Branch of the Canadian Parks Service, to learn freshwater preservation techniques. The preservation process is still in progress today at the museum. Organic materials like wood and leather are submerged in a food preservative called polyethylene glycol (PEG) and then freeze-dried. Preservationists gently remove oxidized material from metal artifacts using metal tools and special erasers. Bottled and jarred foods and beverages are injected with nitrogen, an inert gas. Shoes, boots, and garments must be restitched since their cotton thread dissolved under water. It has been estimated that the preservation of the collection will be completed in 2022.

She first appeared in Batgirl #10 (vol. 4) (August 2012) and was created by Gail Simone and Alitha Martinez. Publication history Knightfall was created by Gail Simone and Alitha Martinez. She first appeared as Charise Carnes in Batgirl #10 (2012), but wasn't formally introduced as Knightfall until the following issue. Origin Charise Carnes and her younger brother Emil were born to William and Virginia Carnes, a rich and prestigious family in Gotham City thanks to her father's real estate dealings. He'd bought a large landfill on the bayfront of Gotham and enacted the state's biggest land reclamation right on top of it. William Carnes was no saint though, building his riches with muscle, bribes, and countless judges in his pocket. Charise was aware of her father's corrupt practices, but idolized him all the same. She never thought another man could come close to the admiration she felt for her father, until she met Trevor. He was a kind boy who was the first one she met that didn't seem to care about her family's riches. He certainly didn't, as one night he came to her house with knives and made Charise bind her parents and little brother up with duct tape, after which he took three hours to cut them to pieces \\"for the lulz\\", all while Charise was forced to watch. Afterwards, reportedly no evidence was found that someone else had committed the slaughter, and so Charise was left as the only suspect. She was found guilty and sent to Arkham Asylum at age 18 due to prison overcrowding. Then there was a massive breakout at Arkham where some of the sickest murderers in the country took guards hostage and \\"played\\" with them. Charise survived, but had been forced to watch this brutality for two straight days. This was all what Charise had wanted however. After Trevor had killed her family, she'd realized that there were crimes that prison simply wasn't severe enough for as punishment. She'd hidden the truth of the massacre in order to get sent to Arkham, in order to learn \\"the craft of madness.\\" She learned everything she could've wanted, especially under the tutelage of James Gordon Jr. while she was in Arkham. Now reshaped as she saw fit, Charise used every one of her father's underhanded methods to get herself released from Arkham. She then set to work on saving Gotham from the madness and crime that had permeated it as Knightfall. As Charise Carnes, she would use her family's money to change Gotham for the better with community service programs and urban redevelopment; and as Knightfall, wielding the knives Trevor had used on her family, she and her Disgraced would use whatever means necessary to apprehend, torment, and kill all criminals. She would rule Gotham, and fix what civilization couldn't. Knightfall descends Following a charity event for her community service programs, Charise had her Disgraced see whether Batgirl would be willing to join their cause by having them threaten to kill a young carjacker, Ricky, that they'd previously caught in a bear-trap. Batgirl failed the test by saving the young man, after which Katharsis attacked her. Batgirl managed to gain the upper hand over Katharsis, but only until the rest of the Disgraced ganged up on her and Charise arrived in her Knightfall guise. Knightfall presented Batgirl with a formal offer to join her and her Disgraced in their endeavors to completely eradicate crime in Gotham. Batgirl would not agree to kill anyone, and so Charise ordered her Disgraced to kill her. Batgirl put up a good fight, but she was simply outnumbered and wound up being held aloft by her throat by Bonebreaker while Knightfall prepared to kill her. Detective Melody McKenna suddenly appeared, however, and ordered Charise to let Batgirl go. McKenna was a cop who worked for Charise, although she had started questioning her methods as Knightfall, and she now threatened to expose everything she knew if Charise didn't let Batgirl go. Charise let Batgirl and McKenna leave, apparently not considering either of them much of a threat. Charise later calls McKenna and orders Batgirl to meet her, telling her that they captured Ricky again and that they'll skin him, gut him, and burn him alive if she doesn't come. Batgirl comes to the agreed location and tangles with the Disgraced again, except she brings McKenna and Batwoman as backup, who handle the Disgraced while Batgirl goes to find Charise. She winds up finding a badly injured Ricky in a cage with another tortured man. She tries to pick the lock, but Charise comes up behind her and stabs her in the stomach. With Batgirl bleeding profusely, Charise lectures her on how it's the fault of people like her that Gotham is overrun with crime. When Batgirl collapses on the floor, she calls Bonebreaker to come dispose of her body, but Batgirl steadies herself and brings the fight to Charise. During the fight, Charise decides to show Batgirl just who she is behind the mask of Knightfall. She tells Batgirl her story: her father's corrupt ways, Trevor's slaughtering of her family, and how she'd chosen to go to Arkham to learn the way of criminals. She also reveals that the other man in the cage with Ricky is, in fact, Trevor, who she's been meticulously torturing for the last few months as his punishment. Batgirl is horrified by this and they continue fighting, although she is still fading from her stab wound. Charise has the upper hand until Ricky grabs her from inside the cage and gives Batgirl a clear hit. Charise goes down, but mocks Batgirl, telling her that she has more than enough officials in her pocket to stay out of prison, with no cop who would even dare arrest her. Batwoman and McKenna then step in, with McKenna more than willing to be the cop who makes that arrest. Charise still taunts Batgirl, claiming that she'll tear Gotham apart, but Batgirl firmly accepts the challenge. Two days later, Charise's Disgraced are seen visiting some of Batgirl's latest rogues: Mirror, Gretel, and Grotesque in their respective prisons, offering to get them out of prison if they'll simply kill Batgirl. Powers and abilities Knightfall is masterfully devious tactician, able to easily go from her facade of a vulnerable young girl to her true, ruthless self. She has a vast network of lawyers, judges, and other officials at her beck and call, due to anything ranging from blackmail to bribery. Her family's fortune gives her a great amount of capital for her endeavors, a fortune she maintains through business deals and charity events. She is also a formidable combatant with the two knives she wields that were used to slaughter her family.http://www.comicvine.com/knightfall/4005-84235/ References Category:Comics characters introduced in 2012 Category:Characters created by Gail Simone Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Female characters in comics Category:Female supervillains Category:Fictional vigilantes ","title":"Knightfall (comics)"},{"id":"43063378","text":"Brooklyn \\"Brookie\\" Supreme (April 12, 1928 ‚Äì September 6, 1948) was a red roan Belgian stallion noted for his extreme size.

Definition A graph G is subhamiltonian if G is a subgraph of another graph aug(G) on the same vertex set, such that aug(G) is planar and contains a Hamiltonian cycle. For this to be true, G itself must be planar, and additionally it must be possible to add edges to G, preserving planarity, in order to create a cycle in the augmented graph that passes through each vertex exactly once. The graph aug(G) is called a Hamiltonian augmentation of G. It would be equivalent to define G to be subhamiltonian if G is a subgraph of a Hamiltonian planar graph, without requiring this larger graph to have the same vertex set. That is, for this alternative definition, it should be possible to add both vertices and edges to G to create a Hamiltonian cycle. However, if a graph can be made Hamiltonian by the addition of vertices and edges it can also be made Hamiltonian by the addition of edges alone, so this extra freedom does not change the definition.For instance in a 2003 technical report \\"Book embeddings of graphs and a theorem of Whitney\\", Paul Kainen defines subhamiltonian graphs to be subgraphs of planar Hamiltonian graphs, without restriction on the vertex set of the augmentation, but writes that \\"in the definition of subhamiltonian graph, one can require that the extension only involve the inclusion of new edges.\\" In a subhamiltonian graph, a subhamiltonian cycle is a cyclic sequence of vertices such that adding an edge between each consecutive pair of vertices in the sequence preserves the planarity of the graph. A graph is subhamiltonian if and only if it has a subhamiltonian cycle. History and applications The class of subhamiltonian graphs (but not this name for them) was introduced by , who proved that these are exactly the graphs with two-page book embeddings.. Subhamiltonian graphs and Hamiltonian augmentations have also been applied in graph drawing to problems involving embedding graphs onto universal point sets, simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs, and layered graph drawing. Related graph classes Some classes of planar graphs are necessarily Hamiltonian, and therefore also subhamiltonian; these include the 4-connected planar graphs. and the Halin graphs.. Every planar graph with maximum degree at most four is subhamiltonian,. as is every planar graph with no separating triangles.. If the edges of an arbitrary planar graph are subdivided into paths of length two, the resulting subdivided graph is always subhamiltonian.

History The 521 Exhibition East is the last surviving streetcar route to serve the Canadian National Exhibition. On April 1980, the name \\"Exhibition East\\" was finally made official, from the former streetcar route name, \\"King Exhibition.\\" This streetcar route operated on special occasions and events that took place at Exhibition Place, such as the Canadian National Exhibition, and the Molson Indy. 521 operated from Richmond, Victoria, and Queen, then west to Church Street. It would then go west on King Street, then south on Bathurst Street, and then west on Fleet Street, where it would go directly to the Exhibition Loop. On the other hand, another streetcar route named 522 Exhibition West operated alongside 521. This route operated from Dundas West Station, where it would run south on Roncesvalles, east on King Street, south on Dufferin, straight to the Dufferin Gates at Exhibition Place. This streetcar route also only operated on special occasions, like route 521. Labour Day of 1986, marked the final operation day of this route, which would later be replaced by the 93 Exhibition West bus, but reinstated for one year in 1995 during the CNE. Resurrection In August 2013, the 521 Exhibition East route was temporarily reinstated because of ongoing construction affecting the 509 Harbourfront line, which ran from Union Station to the Exhibition Loop. On the other hand, the 522 Exhibition West route was reinstated as route 193 Exhibition Rocket, which ran from Dundas West Station to Exhibition Loop. Route The current route of the 521 starts at Exhibition Loop, and runs east on Fleet Street, north on Bathurst Street, then east on King Street West, passing by both St. Andrew Station and King Station, then terminating at Church Street. The route shares its tracks with the 504 King on King Street, the 509 Harbourfront on Fleet Street, and the 511 Bathurst on Fleet Street and Bathurst Street.

He was the Chief Technology Officer of the Democratic National Committee. He was the Engineering Director at Uber's Advanced Technologies Center. He‚Äôs credited with unleashing self- driving cars onto Pittsburgh, PA. He was the former VP of Platform Engineering at Twitter where he was in charge of the backend infrastructure for all of Twitter up to August 2014. He is credited with leading the charge to improve the reliability of Twitter as well as the move from Ruby to the JVM. He currently also serves on the board of directors of the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies in Yerevan, Armenia. Biography =Early life= Krikorian attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was a student of Neil Gershenfeld's. His work involved creating a new type of network for everyday devices called \\"Internet-0\\" (an analogue to the Internet of Things). Along with Gershenfeld, he also taught a class entitled \\"How To Make (Almost) Anything\\". He also worked on an interactive location service for software agents called Wherehoo. He was also \\"an unapologetic TiVo fanatic\\", and wrote \\"TiVo Hacks\\" (O'Reilly Media 2003). Krikorian also was an Adjunct Assistant Professor of Communication at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program. There, he developed two classes entitled \\"Every Bit You Make\\" and \\"Physical Computing without Computers\\". In 2007, Krikorian was partner at Synthesis Studios where he worked on OneHop, a project that uses Bluetooth technology and SMS to alert mobile-phone owners when they come into proximity with other Bluetooth-device owners they‚Äôve met before. =WattzOn= Along with Saul Griffith, Krikorian created Wattzon and debuted it at PopTech in 2008. Their goal was to allows users to calculate their total energy footprint by estimating their direct and indirect power consumption. It's notable, because unlike most carbon calculators it measures energy consumption, and not the by-products (CO2, or CO2 equivalent emissions) and because it aggregates information into a holistic view of energy consumption allowing users to see the energy used in their driving compared to their eating, for example. Wattzon was named Business Week's Best Idea of 2008. =Twitter= Krikorian joined Twitter in 2009 as an engineer on the API team, working on its geospatial APIs. At this time, he created a Tweet \\"map of metadata\\". He is also credited with the integration of Twitter into Apple's iOS 5. Krikorian also made Twitter data available for research universities. After the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which he notes he \\"still [has] PTSD from\\", during which Twitter repeatedly had issues, Krikorian lead the charge to strengthen the service. To do this, Twitter moved to the JVM as well as moved from a monolithic codebase to a more Service-oriented architecture. Twitter has also scaled out their global server infrastructure as well as implemented SPDY. And, Twitter did a lot of work on their storage systems, their observability and statistics systems, and their data analytics products. Twitter made it through the 2014 FIFA World Cup with no site wide incidents. Krikorian has also been part of scaling the engineering culture at Twitter as well as helping open Twitter's Seattle office. He has spoken about #branchingout, \\"Twitter University\\", as well as \\"Hack Week\\". He noted that Hack Week serves \\"[as] a release valve in a lot of ways.\\" In 2014, Krikorian remarked that \\"Twitter [engineering] is entering a 'maturation phase'\\" and that Twitter can confidently say, \\"We know how to do this\\". To do that, Twitter spends a lot of time in capacity planning and breaking services down into tiers to handle ‚Äúburst capacity‚Äù. He said his goal is that Twitter engineers should focus on the end-user experience, and not have to worry about the infrastructure layer. =Uber= Krikorian joined Uber in 2015 in the research department to work on \\"massive scale data and software platforms‚Äù. He has since become the Engineering Director in charge of the Advanced Technologies Center and self-driving. Starting on Wednesday, September 14, 2016, Uber deployed the self-driving cars onto the roads of Pittsburgh, PA. Krikorian has called Pittsburgh the ‚Äúdouble-black diamond of driving‚Äù and also commented that if ‚Äú...Uber can master autonomous driving in Pittsburgh ‚Ä¶ it can make it almost anywhere.\\" =Democratic National Committee= Krikorian joined the Democratic National Committee as their Chief Technology Officer in 2016. He claims he joined because \\"the world is broken\\". He splits his time between Silicon Valley and Washington, DC. His focus is to update the Democratic Party's crumbling infrastructure. In addition, he works on security, nudging voters to vote as well as the \\"cultural\\" elements of bringing engineering to the political world. He stepped down from this role in March 2019. =Emerson Collective= Krikorian is now the Managing Director of Engineering at the Emerson Collective. Armenia Krikorian is active in the Armenian community. He serves on the board of the Tumo Center for Creative Technologies in Yerevan, Armenia where he taught classes and given public lectures. In 2015, at the University of Southern California, he gave a public lecture entitled \\"Why Not Armenia?\\". On 25 April 2015, he hosted an engineering summit at the Tumo center along with Alexis Ohanian. Krikorian tweeted after the summit on the importance of running the event on April 25.

Hugh Baillie was son of Alexander Baillie by (married 1709) Hannah Fraser, of Relig. Alexander Baillie was son of David Baillie, 1st Laird of Dochfour, and second son of Alexander, 7th Laird of Dunain, from whom he inherited Dochfour, Easter and Wester Dochain in 1657, married secondly Margaret daughter of Hugh Fraser, 8th Lord Lovat. Dochfour house, Inverness, Baillie seat, circa 1810; 1780 rebuilding of the 1452 house burnt in 1745 James Baillie's younger brother was Evan Baillie, of Dochfour, of Parliament, the West Indies and Bristol. Baillie arrived in St. Christopher's (Saint Kitts) in 1755, and soon bought the Hermitage plantation in Grenada, undertook around 20 years of work, and in 1775 (?) returned to Great Britain and London. In 1772 James Baillie wrote: \\"[through] 1755‚Äì71 I was employed in the line of planting and commerce in the islands of St Christopher and Grenada [and Demerary]... and [in 1772] our house sold Negroes here to the amount of ¬£120,000 sterling...\\"The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790‚Äì1820, ed.

There he had seemed to have been beaten at the poll, and so before a petition gave him the seat, he had been appointed British agent to Grenada. One is not sure whether he took up that post or where he died. But as Member for Horsham Baillie it is known that he spoke well in favour of the planters (plantation owners) in the slavery debate of 2 April 1792, against Wilberforce's \\"wild, impracticable, and visionary scheme\\" of abolition, adding that there was \\"more wretchedness and poverty in the parish of St. Giles' than in the whole of the British colonies\\".Senator, iv, 512, from The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790‚Äì1820, ed.

In London Baillie lived in Bedford Square and Ealing Grove, the nine bays and three-storeyed pedimented central projection Palladian palace set in 64 acres, re-modeled for Joseph Gulston, the younger, the collector and MP. Ealing Grove had then been owned by 4th Duke of Marlborough (1775) and 5th Duke of Argyll before Baillie bought it in 1791. The 5th Earl of Oxford was the tenant between 1799‚Äì1802, and Baillie's heirs sold it in 1811, having had passed a Private Act of Parliament in 1805. By 1800 James Baillie's widow, Mrs. Baillie (Colina), was living at 12 Harley Street, Cavendish Square. Henry Keene's drawing of Ealing Grove, Middlesex Wife James Baillie's family, by Thomas Gainsborough, RA (c. 1784) (100 x 90 inches) He married, Grenada, 26 April 1772, Colina or Colin Campbell (1753-) one of the two surviving daughters, co- heiresses, of Colin Roy Campbell, of Glenure (c1708-1752), son of Patrick or John Campbell, 3rd or 4th of Barcaldine, Argyll (1677‚Äì1738), by Lucia or Lucy Cameron (1692-) of Loch Eil (Cameron of Locheil), Lochaber, Inverness-shire, daughter of Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, 17th Chief of Clan Cameron (1629‚Äì1719), who Lord Macaulay termed the \\"Ulysses of the Highlands\\". Eight months before Colina's birth, on 14 May 1752, her father, Colin \\"Redfox\\" Campbell, was assassinated at Ballachulish, Lettermore, Argyll, by a member of the Stewart family. This the infamous Appin murder was the base of R. L. Stevenson's Kidnapped. Campbell was Hanoverian factor, or rent collector, for the forfeited estates of Stewart of Ardsheil in Argyllshire, Cameron of Callart, Mamore, and part of that of Cameron of Lochiel. Colina's mother was Janet Mackay (married 1749), daughter of Lt. Col. Hon. Hugh Mackay (son of 3rd Lord Reay) (married 1728) by Elizabeth Mackay, 6th of Bighouse, daughter of George Mackay of Bighouse, Strath Halladale, by Melvich, Sutherland. Colina's elder sister was Louisa Campbell, 8th or Portioner of Bighouse (1751‚Äì1835), painted by Henry Raeburn, who had married George Mackay of Handa (1736-) in 1768, and had: Janet Mackay (c 1768-15.3.1857). The present day Bighouse Lodge was built in 1765.

It was bequeathed to the National Gallery by his son, a school-friend of Lord Byron, \\"Long Baillie\\", Alexander Baillie (1777‚Äì1855) in 1855, with provision for it to first be lent to his nephew Matthew James Higgins (1810‚Äì1868), aka Jacob Omnium; thus it passed to the national collection (now Tate Britain) in 1868. Alexander Baillie, drawn by Ingres in 1816, was a close friend of J√∏rgen von Cappelen Knudtzon (1784‚Äì1854), the Norwegian. Bust portraits of both von Cappelen and Baillie were carved by Bertel Thorvaldsen. Alexander Baillie was buried in the Protestant cemetery in Naples in the same grave as writer and kinswoman Harriet Charlotte Beaujolais Campbell (died Naples 2.1848, aged 46), aka Viscountess Tullamore and Countess of Charleville, who had married (Florence, 1821) Charles Bury, 2nd Earl of Charleville, and Francois \\"Dominique\\" Joseph Loridan, Valet de Chambre to M. Alexander Baillie of Naples, Tuscany (23 April 1780 ‚Äì 16 April 1853). In November 2008 Highland News (13 November 2008) reported that local MSP David Stewart had raised the issue of Inverness Museum and Art Gallery's loan request of the Baillie family by Gainsborough at the Scottish Parliament's Question Time. He was supported by the then tourism minister Jim Mather, as well as Highland Council convener Sandy Park, Inverness Provost Jimmy Gray and Highland councillor and historian David Alston. Stewart said:conflating his 15 October 2008 press release and the Highland News report \\"The painting is controversial because the Baillie family were involved in the slave trade. Following the emancipation of slaves in 1834 they received the equivalent of 5.5 million, which they reinvested in their estates in the Highlands and Islands... and was used to develop the Highlands through establishments like Inverness Royal Academy and the Royal Northern Infirmary. This was the only Highlander that to my knowledge was painted by Gainsborough. However, history should be seen warts and all, it's important that people know what it is. The Baillies played a big part in the development of the Highlands. It's a bit like the Highland Clearances, they are an appalling part of Highland history but people should know about it. Schools could make the painting a research project. If we got the painting on loan this would provide a huge boost to tourism in the Highlands and Islands and attract inward investment. It would be like when Caley Thistle signed Marius Niculae.\\" Mrs. James Baillie, and her youngest daughter Colin-Campbell Baillie (later Mrs. Lloyd), by Gainsborough Dupont, extracted from and after his uncle's original of c.1784 Ingres, Rome, 1816 Marble bust portrait of Alexander Baillie by Bertel Thorvaldsen, 1816 A version of this portrait which just shows Colina and Colin-Campbell by Gainsborough Dupont, it measures 36.5 x 28 inches, and has been in the Collections of Donaldson (Sir George Hunter Donaldson, Kt.

Long was a good painter (nb. his The Temptation in the Wilderness, 1824, in Tate Britain), having been one of the only two known pupils of painter John Martin; however by 1827 he had realised that turpentine served him better as a massage oil for the ladies than mixed with oily pigments and placed on canvas. Exposed as a quack by 1828 he was charged and possibly convicted of Colin-Campbell Lloyd's manslaughter \\"on the grounds of gross ignorance, and on other considerations\\", but he escaped prison.

The prime role of the group is to represent the interests of Portsmouth F.C. The Trust was also the Club's majority owner from 2013 until 2017. History Trust's first meeting was held in September 2009, after various people contacted supporters, talking about the possibility of starting a supporters' trust. On 23 December, the PST was finally created. On 30 March 2012, after Portsmouth's successive relegations and administrations, the Trust launched a bid to try to buy the club, initially asking supporters to donate a minimum of ¬£100. In August, PST announced a new bid, and also Members of the UK Parliament urged Balram Chainrai (Portsmouth's previous owner) to reach a deal with the Trust. On 18 October, PKF administrator Trevor Birch announced that the Trust was named 'preferred bidders' ahead of Chainrai's Portpin. On 15 November, PST signed a conditional agreement with PKF, Portsmouth's administrators, to buy the club. The deal was delayed, however, due to Chainrai's refusal to reach an agreement to the sale of Fratton Park, the club's stadium. On 10 April, a ruling by the High Court of Justice allowed the takeover to proceed. The PST then appointed Iain McInnes as the club's chairman. On 19 April, the club came out of administration. A year after taking over, the PST had 2,300 shareholders and raised around ¬£2.5m through individual pledges of ¬£1,000. On 29 September 2014, after almost 18 months in charge, PST declared that the club was debt- free after paying back all creditors and legacy payments to ex-players. On Saturday 17 December 2016, The Pompey Supporters Trust unveiled their 'Wall Of Fame' plaques to the rear wall of the North Stand's exterior , featuring the names of all the 2,300 PST shareholders who had financially contributed to save Portsmouth FC from liquidation in 2013. In May 2017, PST members voted to sell Portsmouth F.C. to The Tornante Company, an investment company owned by former Disney CEO Michael Eisner. The purchase was completed on 3 August 2017.

It was first published in 1991 by Jonathan Cape and republished in 1992 by Red Fox and then again in 2001 by Puffin Books where it is still in print. The book won the Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize in 1991 in the 9 ‚Äì 11 age categoryhttp://www.booktrust.org.uk/prizes/archive/13 and was chosen by children as an all-time favourite. It also won a WH Smith Mind-Boggling Book Award in 1993https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/W+H+Smith+Mind- Boggling+Books+Award and became a Tellastory Audio Cassette in 1994 that was read by Rik Mayall.https://www.amazon.com/Krindlekrax-Audio-Philip- Ridley/dp/185656181X In 2000, to celebrate the new millennium, Hachette Children's Group published Out of this world, a collection of extracts from \\"the best in 20th century children's literature\\". Krindlekrax was one of the books featured and appeared alongside such classics as Roald Dahl's Matilda and J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.https://www.waterstones.com/book/out-of-this-world/david-almond/philip- ridley/9780340774106 Plot The story takes place in a street called Lizard Street, located in a town with cracked pavements, scorched brickwork and bumps and holes in the roads. It centres around a 9-year-old boy named Ruskin Splinter, who is small and thin with thick glasses, red frizzy hair, knock- knees and a squeaky voice. He wants to be the hero of a school play, but everyone criticises him for his appearance and voice, and the role is instead given to Ruskin's window smashing former friend Elvis Cave. Ruskin's special friend is the local school caretaker, Corky Pigeon, who tells him his experiences with the evil monster that lurks in the sewers and terrorises the street, a giant fire breathing crocodile named Krindlekrax. Later, Ruskin finds out from his drunken dad that everyone in Lizard Street was responsible for the monster getting into the sewers in the first place, and how it grew so big. Suddenly Corky unexpectedly dies, and everyone suspects it to be a heart attack, but Ruskin knows that Krindlekrax was responsible, and is angry with all of Lizard Street for allowing it to happen. Ruskin is so upset with Corky's death, that he can't get out of bed, but many people bring him gifts and tell him the story of how Corky got a gold medal (that he later gave to Ruskin as a present) from saving Lizard Street. After this, Ruskin decides to save the street from the wrath of Krindlekrax once and for all. Later that night, Ruskin lures the monster out of the sewers, and tames it by throwing Corky's medal in its mouth, banishing it to the sewers forever. After catching a terrible cold, Elvis can't do the play any more, so Ruskin takes his place and it all goes well, but Elvis isn't pleased and smashes all the windows in Lizard Street he can in a tantrum. Ruskin stops Elvis' window smashing by bursting his ball and after a long talk, they become friends again. The story ends with Ruskin saying how much he now loves his street.

Multiple video game journalists have written about the dedication of the game's fans in producing fan art and lobbying Nintendo for further releases in the series. The company has been largely unresponsive to their efforts. Prominent fansites include Starmen.net and EarthBound Central. The former was started in 1999 and became the definitive community website. Their members organized petitions and campaigns to bring English-localized games from the Mother series to North America. One such effort included a full-color, 270-page EarthBound Anthology as a demonstration of consumer demand for further releases. After nearly a decade, EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, whereupon it became a bestseller. The fandom also spun-out other enterprises. When Nintendo did not release a localized version of Mother 3, fans organized their own fan translation. The video game merchandising business Fangamer grew out of the Starmen.net community, and sells video game-related items online. A full- length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community, EarthBound, USA, is in production. While series creator, Shigesato Itoi has stated that he is finished with the series, a fan-created spiritual sequel, Oddity, began development in 2010.  Fan base  EarthBound is known for having a cult following, which developed over time well after its release. Colin Campbell of Polygon wrote that \\"few gaming communities are as passionate and active\\" as EarthBound, and 1UP.com Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following. Wired described the amount of EarthBound \\"fan art, videos, and tributes on fan sites like EarthBound Central or Starmen.net\\" as mountainous. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that EarthBound \\"persistent\\", \\"ambitious\\", and \\"religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans\\" would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo's decision-making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console. The Verge cited the two-year fan translation of Mother 3 as proof of the fanbase's dedication, and Nintendo president Satoru Iwata credited the community response on their online Miiverse social platform as leading to EarthBound eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform. EarthBound was hard to find before the rerelease. In 2013, prices for the game's cartridge alone were more than twice its retail cost at its 1995 release. IGN wrote that the game became a \\"cult classic\\" for its unique RPG and psychedelic elements alongside its reflection on American culture, and Eurogamer credited EarthBound \\"cute and funny modern-world styling of the Japanese RPG\\". Kotaku hypothesized that fan favorite aspects of the game would include its \\"feeling of innocence, ... sense of whimsical adventure\\", \\"humor\\", \\"charm\\", \\"wonder\\", and \\"beautiful 2D maps\\". Marcus Lindblom, the game's English localizer, cited its \\"cuteness, colors, and hallucinatory bits\\" as fan favorites. Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits EarthBound popularity to its \\"labor of love\\" nature, with a \\"double-coat of thoughtfulness and care\\" across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work. Digital Trends's Anthony John Agnello wrote that \\"no video game fans have suffered as much as EarthBound fans, and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release Mother series games in North America. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons. Aaron Linde of Shacknews felt that Nintendo's \\"historic passive- aggression towards EarthBound fans [seemed] somehow anachronistic\\" in response to the outcries from the game's fan community. He added that while the company is known for providing \\"the most personal experiences in gaming's history\\", Nintendo lacks the \\"bedside manner\\" required of contemporary game companies, and that he could not think of a \\"more deserving fan base\\" than EarthBound. Marcus Lindblom, who localized the Japanese Mother 2 into the English EarthBound, followed the fan community from afar and, in mid-2012, introduced himself at the Penny Arcade Expo Fangamer booth. When the game's Wii U re- release was announced, the press became interested in Lindblom's experience. Lindblom had planned a book about the game's development, release, and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea. He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game's history. For instance, Lindblom struck down a popular (\\"infamous\\") \\"abortion theory\\" that the game's final sequence is a metaphor for an abortion, with Giygas as the fetus. In April 2016, a film group known as 54&O; Productions announced a Kickstarter campaign to secure funds for a fan-made documentary entitled Mother to Earth. The documentary will focus on the road to Mother's localization in North America, and will include interviews with key people behind the process.  Starmen.net  Reid Young started an EarthBound fansite in 1997 while in middle school. It was one of the first EarthBound fansites on the Internet. By 1999 and with co-founder Clyde \\"Tomato\\" Mandelin, the site grew into Starmen.net, named for the game's \\"most iconic villain, the Starman.\\" 1UP.com described the site as \\"the definitive fan community for EarthBound on the web\\" and Shacknews called it the fan community's \\"one-stop\\" resource for a decade. Though EarthBound was more obscure at the time, the site quickly grew in popularity and featured \\"constant updates\\" and a burgeoning community by 1999. 1UP.com said the viewership growth was \\"almost inexplicable\\" when accounting for the game's unpopularity, but credited Super NES emulation, which let \\"thousands\\" of people experience the game who might not have otherwise. Young credited the site's growth to the fan content generated by the community. Shacknews described the site's collection of fan-made media as \\"absolutely massive\\". It also provided a place to aggregate information on the Mother series and to coordinate fan actions. The EarthBound fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series. 1UP.com described their intent as reasonable given the company's \\"frequent dismissal\\" of the series alongside the community's \\"monumental efforts to increase American EarthBound awareness\\". Young felt that their \\"underdog status\\" kept Starmen.net vigilant. He also said that he views the community as \\"a big group of friends having fun together\\" and sometimes thinks that it is just happenstance that EarthBound was what brought them together, as opposed to another franchise like Pok√©mon. As the site started in 1999, the community started a petition to have Nintendo release Mother for the Game Boy Color, and collected 1850 physical signatures to this end and bound it in a book for Nintendo. The final word from Nintendo was that the package was received. Other petitions include the 2000 10,000-person petition for a North American Mother 3 release on the Nintendo 64, the 2003 31,000-person petition for a North American Mother 1+2 Game Boy Advance release, and letter and phone campaigns. A source internal to Nintendo later told them that the 2003 campaign was almost successful, but fell out of consideration as the phone campaign ended after a week. The community resolved to never let up again. In time, the fan community's requests shifted from specific demands to no demand at all, wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo. The Starmen.net community launched several campaigns to bring attention to the series. In their 2007 \\"The EB Siege\\" project to have Mother 3 receive an official North American localization, community members sent letters and made phone calls to Nintendo. They ultimately created a full-color, 270-page art book, The EarthBound Anthology, to send to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of their interest. They also hoped the volume would mobilize established industry professionals to take up their cause in advance of the 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Shacknews wrote that the \\"folk history\\" was more of a proposal than a collection of fan art‚Äî\\"the greatest gaming love letter ever created\\". Wired Chris Kohler used the Anthology's occasion to explain how Nintendo's upper management has heard the fan community. The Anthology additionally received mention in Nintendo Power. Upon \\"little\\" response from Nintendo, they decided to localize the game themselves. Starmen.net co-founder Tomato led the project, and the complete fan translation was finished in October 2008. They then printed a \\"professional quality strategy guide\\" through Fangamer, a site that spun off from Starmen.net. Other oblique strategies included an attempt to license Mother 3 for North America from Nintendo through a small video game development studio, but Nintendo replied that the property was theirs and would never be developed externally. In 2008, the site hosted a YouTube contest for videos that raised the visibility for the series in a final effort to get the game on the Wii Virtual Console, but Young found community spirit to be atrophied. A week later, the game appeared on the ESRB website, which signaled success after many years of work. It was finally rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013 via a Nintendo Direct announcement. The game was a \\"top-seller\\" on the platform, and Kotaku users and first-time EarthBound players had an \\"overwhelmingly positive\\" response to the game. = Mother 3 fan translation = After a decade of development hell, the Japanese video game Mother 3 was released in April 2006. When fan interest in an English localization went unanswered by Nintendo, Starmen.net announced their own fan translation in November 2006. The project was led by the fansite's Clyde \\"Tomato\\" Mandelin, a professional game translator whose previous work includes games such as Kingdom Hearts II and anime such as Dragon Ball. The dozen fans who worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior localization experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch to be used with an emulator, a process of murky legality. The patch was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the fan translation. 1UP.com wrote that \\"no other game in the history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation\\", and The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication. = Fangamer = Fangamer is a video game merchandising business spun out from Starmen.net. The online store sells items including hats, pins, and T-shirts branded with video game-related designs from games such as EarthBound, Chrono Trigger, and Metal Gear Solid. 1UP.com described their fare as \\"much less tacky than your typical mall-bought video game apparel\\". The site began in part due to Young's experience with targeted fan communities. In October 2008, he was attempting to get the site officially licensed. Later that month, they released the Mother 3 Handbook, a full-color, 200-page player's guide akin to a professional strategy guide. Wired reported its quality to be \\"on par with ... Prima and BradyGames\\". In 2014, Fangamer crowdfunded a box set of media celebrating EarthBound, with $230,000 raised‚Äîover twice its goal. The box set includes a travel zine for the game's fictional settings EarthBound, an album of music, and the documentary EarthBound, USA. Since exceeding the campaign's goal, the business hosted Camp Fangamer, an event in Tucson, Arizona, for 450 fans. = EarthBound, USA = In April 2014, brothers Jeff and Robbie Benson announced the production of their documentary \\"about how EarthBound fans have fought to popularize the Mother series in North America since the 1990s\\", EarthBound, USA. The Bensons had been conducting interviews with EarthBound fans and Starmen.net members for a year prior to the announcement. They had previously begun a feature- length film about the events of EarthBound. Starmen.net \\"inspired\\" the documentary, which seeks to explain how the site's members convened via online message board and the consequent \\"re-emergence of a cult classic\\" and birth of Fangamer. The filmmakers had been planning to wait longer before making the announcement, but were preempted in part by interest following a tweet from series creator Shigesato Itoi, which mentioned their interview.  Fangames  After Mother 3, Shigesato Itoi declared that he was done with the series. In response to Nintendo's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel, fans began to develop their own entry, Mother 4, in October 2010. As of September 2016, the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. In a preview of the game, Jason Schreier of Kotaku said Mother 4 looked \\"stunning\\", as \\"everything you could possibly want out of a new Mother game\\", from the music to the environment design. The fan-made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice. No future release date has been set. Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game, without need for an emulator. In March 2017, however, the team announced that as a preventative measure from getting taken down, the game would be rebranded, with 'Mother 4' no longer being the title of the game, and all direct references to the Mother series, like Mr. Saturn, removed. The decision came after many recent fan games received a DMCA notice. On January 2, 2020 the game was officially rebranded as Oddity. The game takes place in a parody of contemporary America, as a boy named Travis leaves his town of Belring to join three others in a fight against the \\"mysterious\\" Modern Men. The game is expected to associate with the stories of the previous series games, and be similar in length. Its music and visuals are similar in style to the rest of the series. Mother 4 features a new soundtrack. Its creators are currently working on a voluntary basis without compensation.

Aiming to counter cultural stereotypes and give a voice to urban artists, the collective has mounted several exhibitions around the country. The collective was founded by Richard Bell, Jennifer Herd, Joshua Herd and Vernon Ah Kee in 2003 and formalised in 2004. History and mission The collective was first conceived in Brisbane in 1997. At its initial meeting, proppaNOW proposed to form as a group of Aboriginal Australian artists who would support each other's work and \\"change ideas that people had about what Aboriginal art is and what it should be\\". The trigger to formalise the collective came in March 2004 soon after Queensland‚Äôs Premier, Peter Beattie, established QIAMEA (Queensland Indigenous Artists Marketing Export Agency) to promote and market Queensland Indigenous art. The artists were concerned that QIAMEA‚Äôs focus was initially directed towards the remote regions of Queensland such as Mornington Island, Aurukun and Lockhart River, thus reinforcing cultural stereotypes. The collective has since evolved a mission to \\"give urban-based Aboriginal artists a voice...[to]reinforce that Aboriginal Australia is a living culture that has evolved over time\\". In June 2019, proppaNOW presented an open day at the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane. In 2019, a forthcoming exhibition was announced, entitled OCCURRENT AFFAIR: proppaNOW, and scheduled to run 1 August ‚Äì 28 November 2020 at the University of Queensland Art Museum, described as a major exhibition of the artists' work \\"after a five-year hiatus to focus on their individual careers\\". The title of the exhibition references the Australian TV show A Current Affair, which is known for its sensationalist style and \\"derogatory representations of certain low socio-economic and minority groups\\". Members Founding members were Richard Bell, Jennifer Herd, Joshua Herd and Vernon Ah Kee. Members of the collective are Bell, Herd, Ah Kee, Tony Albert, Gordon Hookey, Laurie Nilsen and Megan Cope. Exhibitions The collective has mounted a number of exhibitions, starting with one in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2005. Since then, many have been based in Queensland, but several have toured the country or mounted in other locations.

Exclusively released in Japan in 2012 by the local carrier NTT Docomo, the device features a dual-core processor and a 720p autostereoscopic display, and was notably the first smartphone to support a new mobile TV service that had been developed in collaboration with NTT Docomo. In June 2012, a special edition of the SH-06D themed after the anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion was released in honour of the upcoming film, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo. The special edition, of which only 10,000 were made, featured a redesigned exterior and custom user interface modeled off the MAGI computer systems portrayed in the series.  Specifications  The Aquos SH-06D uses a plastic-based construction, and is waterproof. It incorporates a slide-out antenna, which can be used for mobile television over either 1seg or the subscription-based service NotTV‚Äîa joint venture between NTT Docomo and other Japanese media companies. The service utilizes wireless spectrum that was formerly used for analog terrestrial television, freed by the country's transition to digital television. The SH-06D was one of two launch devices for the service, the other being a tablet produced by NEC Casio. The device features a 4.5 in (110 mm) 720p autostereoscopic display, a dual-core 1.2 GHz Texas Instruments OMAP system-on-chip with 1 GB of RAM, and 8 GB of internal storage that can be expanded via MicroSD.

The law was enacted in 1991, during the presidency of Carlos Menem, and was the first gender quota law to be passed in Latin America. Following Argentina's lead, eleven other Latin American countries have since introduced gender quotas to increase female representation at the national level. Description The number of female legislators elected in the 1983 general election (the first election after the National Reorganization Process) was minimal.Hinojosa, p. 217 In 1989, legislation to ensure larger representation of women was introduced by the Radical Civic Union and supported by women legislators from other parties. After initial debate in September 1990, in November 1991 the bill was passed by a large majority of the Chamber of Deputies.Carrio, p. 165 President Carlos Menem also favored the proposal. It became law as an amendment to the National Electoral Code. Initially, only the women who were not allowed in the party list in the required quota could request in court the compliance of the law; it was amended later to allow any citizen to denounce parties that did not follow the quota. The law sets a quota of female candidates for each party, which must be both a 80% of the total of candidates, and at least one for each third name in the rank. The success of the law is caused by the characteristics of the Argentine electoral system. The parties offer a closed list of candidates, with fixed ranks, and voters must vote for the whole list of a given party. The large district magnitude helps as well.Hinojosa, p. 219 Results The quota law made a huge impact. The Argentine Chamber of Deputies initiated 64 female deputies in 1995, 76 in 2001, and 93 in 2005. The respective percentages were 24.9%, 30% and 36.2% of the plenum. The law did not initially apply in the Argentine Senate, which worked with indirect elections. The electoral system for the Senate switched to direct elections in 1995, dramatically raising the number of female senators, who accounted for 2.8% of the senate in 1995 and 33.3% in 2001.Hinojosa, pp. 217-218. By 2007, 33% of deputies and 24% of senators in the Argentine legislature were female. Although the number of women in office has increased, Elisa Maria Carrio (2012) notes that the male politicians who still dominate Argentina's political parties often place the name of their wives or other female family members on ballots, with the expectation that they will have control over the women's actions once they are elected.Carrio, p. 170 Most provinces of Argentina enacted similar laws for their domestic elections, each one fitting into the context of their local laws. Each province has a provincial legislature; as of October 2003, female deputies accounted for 27.9% and female senators accounted for 20.4% of provincial legislatures. Following Argentina's lead, eleven other countries in Latin America and South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru) adopted similar gender quota laws during the following decade, with varying effects on women's share of legislative seats.Dahlerup, p. 146 A twelfth country, Venezuela, also adopted a quota law, but later rescinded it.Htun, p. 118 In the 2006 election, the quota law in Ecuador contributed to increasing the representation of women in the nation's legislature from 15% to 25%. In Honduras, the institution of a quota law helped increase women's share of legislative seats to 23% after the 2005 election, having been only 5.5% previously.

It extends northwest along Church Street (formerly Old Center Road South) from its junction with North Road, Candia Road, and Raymond Road. It includes many of the town's municipal buildings, as well as a church and private residences, most of which were built before about 1920. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The town of Deerfield was incorporated in 1766, having originally been part of a land grant that formed Nottingham in 1721. Its early town center, little more than the colonial meeting house, was located north of the present center nearer the town's geographic center, and was set high on a hill, with little level space for growth. The present town center grew around the crossroads of Church, Candia, Raymond, and North roads. A Baptist congregation built a church here in 1805, and by the 1820s there was a small cluster of buildings including houses and taverns. By 1835 all of the local religious groups had churches here, and in 1845 the town voted to build a new town hall, demolishing the original meeting house and using some of its timbers for the new one. Other municipal buildings followed, including the library (1913-14) and fire department (1933). The historic district extends from the main junction northwest along Church Street. It includes fourteen primary buildings, of which twelve are historic. There are three churches, the town hall, fire station, and Soldiers Memorial (which houses the library), while the remaining buildings are residential. Construction appears to have happened in three major waves: the 1830s, 1850-60s, and 1880s. All but two buildings are of wood frame construction, and covered in either clapboards or modern siding of similar appearance, while the fire station and memorial are brick. The buildings are stylistically diverse, with 19th-century styles predominating but none individually dominating.

On April 22, 1898, the French sent warships and soldiers to land in Suixi County, occupying the Haitou Fort (now in the Xiashan District, Zhanjiang City). After that, Guangzhouwan was leased by Qing China to France, according to the Treaty of Territoire de Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan. However, the French received a dozen of times of armed resistance from Zhanjiang people. On June 19, 1989, villagers from Nanliu, Haitou, Lvtang and Hongwu gathered together to fight against the French army. They were the first group of Zhanjiang people fighting against the French colonial rule in Guangzhouwan. After that, thousands of Zhanjiang people joined into the battles.

Built about 1805, it is a prominent local example of Federal architecture, further notable for its occupation by two of the town's leading 19th-century doctors. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Dudley House occupies a prominent position on the east side of Front Street in downtown Exeter, nearly across the street from both the Congregational Church and Exeter Town Hall. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and two interior brick chimneys. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a gabled portico supported by two columns. The entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and fluted pilasters, and is topped by a transom window. The interior follows a center hall plan, although the main stair ascends from the back rather than the front. Later 19th-century additions include an ell and an attached carriage barn. The house was built sometime between about 1805 and 1813, and is one of Exeter's finest examples of Federal architecture. It was built for Dr. William Perry, who was for many years a leading physician of the town. He was succeeded in this role by his son, William Gilman Perry. During the latter's ownership, they probably hosted writer Sarah Orne Jewett, a family friend. Perry's daughter married Albertus Dudley, descendant of Rev.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Fly Manufacturing Company was a textile manufacturing business that operated in Shelbyville from 1915 to 1985. The business was established by Joel Orval Fly, who had previously managed a textile factory in Clarksville, Tennessee. After arriving in Shelbyville in 1915, he opened a factory a workforce of 18 to 20 people made overalls, pants and work shirts. The following year, Fly expanded his operation into a larger facility, where it continued for about a decade before he began construction of the Fly Manufacturing Building. In 1925, he hired John Morgan Raney to build the new factory building, which was completed in 1927. A two-story industrial building with a full basement and dimensions of , it was one of the largest buildings in the city at the time of its completion. In the 1920s, Shelbyville was a center of industrial activity. As of 1928, Fly employed 75 people in the production of shirts. The factory's products were sold both to local stores and national businesses such as Sears and Montgomery Ward. Fly Manufacturing remained in business through the Great Depression, but with reduced work schedules that allowed all employees to work at least two or three days weekly. During World War II the factory made pants, jackets, and fatigues for American soldiers. Joel Fly died in 1960. The company he established continued to operate as an independent manufacturing company until 1972, when it was sold to the Bayly Corporation, a garment manufacturer based in Denver, Colorado. Bayly converted the facility to a distribution center for the southeastern United States. In 1980, Bayly sold the facility to the Woodway Corporation. Woodway returned the building to its original use as a factory and produced clothing there until 1985, when a decline in business led it to cease operations. Preservation and transformation into Fly Arts Center After the factory closed, the building was neglected for about a decade. In 1996, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its significance in Shelbyville's industrial history. The Bedford County Arts Council restored the building and converted it to its current use as an arts center. As the Fly Arts Center, it houses a theater, museum, art gallery, classrooms, and a gift shop.

The property includes one of Danville's finest examples of a 19th-century connected farmstead, with buildings dating from the late 18th to late 19th centuries. The property encompassing the farm buildings was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 (where it is listed at 156 Beach Plain Road). Description and history The John Elkins Farmstead is located in rural northeastern Danville, on the north side of Beach Plain Road a short way east of Hillside Terrace. It consists of a main house, with a wing that connects it to a barn; a carriage shed frames the west side of the courtyard formed by these structures, which lie just north of Beach Plain Road. The main house is a 2-1/2 story frame structure with a gabled roof and central chimney. Its centered entry is a 20th-century replacement for what was, by architectural analysis, probably a Federal style surround with sidelights and a fanlight. The interior has been carefully reconstructed in the Federal style, retaining original features where possible, and recreating others from documentary photographs. The barn is an unusually large 2-1/2 story structure with timber framing, and a two sliding front entrances. It is also accessible from the house via the wing on both floors, an unusual arrangement. The construction date of the farmhouse is not known from documentary sources; architectural evidence suggests it was built in the late 18th century, probably for Jeremiah Elkins, who had recently married. The barn and shed were built by the Elkins' son John, likely in 1875. John Elkins was known as one of Danville's most successful farmers, adapting new technologies and practices as they came about. It was sold out of the Elkins family in 1919.

The two novellas were translated into English by Peter Theroux and published in 1995 by the Temple University Press.Caesar, p. 253. The works were copyrighted 1984 and published by D√¢r al-Tanw√Ær (). The short stories are \\"Al-Mahdi\\" () and \\"Good News from the Afterlife\\" ( Turaf min khabar al-√¢khira).Qasim, Abd Al-Hakim. Rites of Assent: Two Novellas (Border Lines : Works in Translation). Temple University Press, 1995. , 9781566393546. pp. PP6. The settings of both novellas are small Nile Delta villages.Caesar, p. 254. Samia Mehrez of the American University of Cairo wrote the introduction, which includes a biography of the author and a critical analysis of the works.Allen, p. 461. The title refers to what Judith Caesar of the American University of Sharjah stated as \\"the assent of those who know better to the voice of convention and their failure to assent to what they know to be the truth.\\"Caesar, p. 255. This theme appears in both novellas. Caesar stated that in both novellas \\"the meaning is not conveyed through rounded characterization, but by what all the relatively flat characters taken together suggest by their actions or inaction.\\" Caesar stated that the Theroux translations were \\"beautifully written, the language spare, pared-down, precise.\\" \\"Al-Mahdi\\" The first novella is \\"Al-Mahdi.\\" In the novella, Awadallah, a Coptic umbrella-maker, moves with his wife and children to the countryside to find work and to stop living on his landlady's charity. He had moved from Tanta, a large city, because the umbrella making trade was outdated in the urban areas. A Muslim landowner named Ali Effendi gives Awadallah charity because the former wants to prove that Muslims have more charity than Christians. Awadallah and his family fear that Ali Effendi will attempt to convert him to Islam but they does not want to offend him, so they accept his charity. The Muslim Brothers of the community give Awadallah a house, along with other help and then attempt to coerce Awadallah into converting to Islam. One of them man states \\"From the time the man first came to our town, until this morning, we never let up for a moment.\\" The brothers give Awadallah books on Islam and his mental state deteriorates. Judith Caesar of the American University of Sharjah wrote that the family members \\"feel more like hostages than guests\\". M.D. Allen of the University of Wisconsin Center Fox Valley stated that the author believed that the Muslim Brotherhood was \\"a group of socially disadvantaged hypocrites who mask a will to violence and power behind their religion's call to show charity toward the unfortunate.\\" Caesar wrote that \\"The Muslim Brothers who bully Awadallah into enacting his supposed conversion are formerly confused and uncertain young men who have found a sense of community and mission in fundamentalist Islam that they want to share with others.\\"Caesar, p. 254-255. Once Awadallah agrees to convert, he is paraded around the streets. Sheikh Sayid al-Hasari, a Sufi preacher, condemns the forced conversion ceremony. Caesar wrote that the sheikh believed that the men \\"are utterly unaware that\\" by forcing Awadallah \\"they are violating the spirit of their own religion. They are not evil, but mindless.\\" Ali Effendi and the town mayor also condemn it. They do not prevent it from happening. The mayor, who Caesar described as \\"henpecked\\", distracts himself from the affair by trying to engage in sexual intercourse with a servant girl, and Caesar states that \\"the scene of his pitiful sexual impotence with a willing servant girl [is] paralleling his moral impotence.\\" Allen states that the story contrasts the Sufi's \\"gentle scrupulousness\\" with the Brotherhood's \\"aggressive indifference to anything outside their religious/political aims\\" and that \\"Awadallah's conversion ceremony is compared, not subtly, to the Crucifixion.\\" Awadallah believes that he is about to re-enact the Stations of the Cross. He dies before he is to arrive at the mosque and his wife makes a Christian prayer over his body. Caesar stated that the characters are \\"men who have been given the insight and the opportunity to act nobly, but they fail to do so because this action would bring them into conflict with popular opinion.\\" According to Caesar, in regards to the characters \\"The guilty and the innocent are not so easily distinguished from one another, but it is those who betray what they know to be true who lose the most.\\" Caesar argues that \\"Qasim presents these characters as well with neutral sympathy.\\" In his English version Peter Theroux used the original Arabic title, and Caesar stated that he \\"wisely does not attempt to translate it\\". Caesar stated that the plot summary \\"suggests\\" that the novella is a \\"plea for religious tolerance\\" but she stated that the novella \\"is much more than\\" that. \\"Good News from the Afterlife\\" The second novella is \\"Good News from the Afterlife.\\" The main characters include an elderly man and his grandson. The elderly man on the outside appears, in the words of Caesar, as \\"respectable\\", \\"saintly and otherworldly\\" and he holds \\"a reputation for learning and piety\\". In fact he has bitterness and resentment. Caesar stated that the grandson \\"seems to represent\\" an alter ego of the elderly man and that he would be \\"the person the grandfather could have been if he had not become so involved in the petty quarrels and spites of village life.\\" The novella is divided into two sections. The first section is told in the point of view of the grandson and explores the grandfather's character. Allen stated that the section includes \\"the ruminations of a bookish and sensitive boy\\" and the boy's \\"sun-struck hallucinations\\". At one point the grandfather dies. During the second section two angels perform a judgment of the life of the grandfather. In regards to the angels Allen characterized them as \\"[m]outhpieces of their human creator\\" and he added that \\"they do not convince as transcendent representatives of a world religion\\" and that the angels \\"do not have the gift of light disquisition\\". They have a conversation with the grandfather who, in the words of Caesar, \\"begins to understand how he failed to understand and to love the people around him, and how he betrayed his own sense of himself.\\" The story revealed that the old man wanted to love his cousin but she disliked him. He chose to close himself off to his wife and focus on religious studies due to his unwillingness to love his wife. In addition, he was afraid of acting in a manner unacceptable to society and admitting that he was angry at his father. Allen stated \\"We are enabled to re-create the latter's life as he acquires the serenity and wholeness of knowledge that come with death.\\" Caesar stated that \\"Now the chance he once had for an authentic life is gone and his life is over. His punishment, if punishment it is, is knowing that.\\" Reception Caesar wrote that the novellas were \\"not just a blending of village Sufism and the existential philosophies of post-war Europe, but a uniquely personal and original vision of what man is and should be\\" and that they were \\"intensely lyrical, intellectually provocative, and philosophical\\". Allen argued that the novella \\"Good News from the Afterlife\\" has \\"a final impression of irritating pretentiousness\\" and that compared to \\"Al-Mahdi\\" it \\"is more ambitious and less successful.\\" He criticized the portions of the story dealing with the boy and \\"the reader's - or this reader's - inability to decide what actually happens\\".

The engine was conceived in 2014, and received US government funding to build a prototype engine in 2016. By 2018, the USAF had committed of government funding to develop the engine and build an initial engine prototype, while Aerojet will put of private capital into the project through the prototype build. , there have been no plans to take the AR1 to full production. History Aerojet Rocketdyne proposed in 2014 to \\"lobby the government to fund an all-new, U.S.-sourced rocket propulsion system.\\" In June 2014, Aerojet's initially projected it would cost under per pair of engines, not including the up to estimated development cost to be funded by the government. Later in 2014, the US Congress passed a law requiring the US Air Force to \\"develop a new propulsion system by 2019 to replace the RD-180 engine\\" that powers Atlas V used by United Launch Alliance (ULA). Dynetics is a key partner in development of the AR1 engine. Under a joint venture agreement, Dynetics is to supply elements of the engine's main propulsion system, the ignition system, and ground support equipment, along with analysis support to critical engine designs. ULA announced in early February 2015 that they were considering undertaking domestic production of the Russian RD-180 engine at its Decatur, Alabama rocket manufacturing facility, and made assurances that the US-manufactured engines would be used only for government civil (NASA) or commercial launches, and would not be used for US military launches. ULA CEO Tory Bruno indicated that ULA was also evaluating the AR1 option, along with the US manufacture of the RD-180 by ULA under license, as backup options to the primary option ULA was then pursuing for the Atlas V successor, subsequently named Vulcan, with the Blue Origin BE-4 methane/LOX engine. , ULA was targeting a maiden flight of Vulcan to be no earlier than 2019. For this engine competition, the AR1 engine had the advantage of matching the fuel configuration of the Atlas V launch vehicle. However, it was disadvantaged by being much earlier in the development process for a new rocket engine to replace the high performing RD-180 engine. In February 2015, the USAF released the results of its analysis of the project to build a new US government-funded engine in five years, and said that the \\"2019 deadline was too aggressive given that it would likely take six to eight years to develop an alternate U.S.-built engine, plus another year or two to integrate the new engine with existing rockets.\\" Aerojet Rocketdyne had stated a commitment to delivering the AR1 in 2019. In September 2015, AJR made an offer to buy ULA for . Shortly thereafter however, ULA and Blue Origin announced a joint agreement to expand production capabilities in order to manufacture the BE-4 rocket engine currently in development and test. ULA also reconfirmed that the decision on using the BE-4 vs. AJR AR1 for the new Vulcan rocket would not be made until late 2016 at the earliest. In early 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded a US$115 million contract to Aerojet Rocketdyne for development of the AR1 engine to be completed in 2019. Contract options could increase government funding up to $536 million.\\"ULA's candidates to replace RD-180 engine win Air Force funding\\". spaceflightnow.com \\"Aerojet, ULA Nab Air Force Contracts to Replace Russian Rocket Engine\\". Defense News, 29 February 2016. Aerojet had received in funding for AR1 through June 2017.\\"AR1 rocket R&D; costs reach $228 million\\". Space News, August 2017. In April 2017, Aerojet announced that the AR1 would be built in a new factory planned to be built in Huntsville, Alabama. Aerojet completed the AR1's Critical Design Review (CDR) in May 2017., globenewswire.com In February 2018, Aerojet began negotiating with the U.S. Air Force to reduce the company's financial contribution to the development of the AR1 engine to one-sixth of the costs (from a previously agreed one-third). Up to that date, AJR had \\"spent US$86.1 million on AR1 research and development, out of total costs incurred to date of US$236.6 million.\\" By June 2018, the USAF had renegotiated the agreement with AJR and decreased the Air Force's contribution to $295 million, which is 5/6ths of the total cost. AJR is adding no additional private funds into the engine development effort after early 2018. The revised contract requires that AJR complete a prototype engine by the end of 2019. In September 2018, ULA announced that the BE-4 engine would power the first stage of the Vulcan. In October 2019, Rocketdyne announced a working agreement with Firefly Aerospace for the AR1 engine to power Firefly's planned Beta launcher.

The courthouse square was laid out in 1810 as a central block, bounded by four streets and surrounded by a grid of square city blocks of the same size. Merchants and tradesmen located their businesses on the blocks surrounding the courthouse square. Lots with street frontage facing the courthouse initially sold for prices 40 times higher than land near the edge of the town grid. This design, known as the \\"Shelbyville square\\" or \\"Shelbyville plan\\", was the prototype for numerous other public squares created throughout the 19th century in towns in southern Middle Tennessee, other parts of the southeastern United States, the American Midwest, and Texas. Five different Bedford County courthouse buildings have stood on the courthouse square. The first courthouse was completed in 1810. A new structure replaced it in 1813. That second courthouse was destroyed by a tornado on May 31, 1830. The third courthouse building was completed in 1833 and stood until 1863, when it was burned down (apparently accidentally) by Confederate Army forces occupying Shelbyville. It was replaced in 1873 by the county's fourth courthouse. In 1934, a lynch mob burned down the fourth courthouse after learning that the young African- American man they wanted to hang had been taken from the county jail and transported to another county for his protection. The current courthouse building is Bedford County's fifth courthouse. It is a Classical Revival building designed in 1935 by the Nashville architectural firm of Marr and Holman. Italianate and Romanesque architectural styles predominate among the historic commercial buildings facing the streets around the square. The Gunter Building, built in 1927 on the west side of the square, is designed in the Art Deco style. The historic district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Nojpet√©n was closely packed with buildings that included temples, palaces and thatched houses.Jones 1998, p. xix. In 1698 Spanish accounts describe the city as having had twenty-one temples, the largest of these (which the Spanish called a castillo) had a square base measuring on each side. It had nine stepped levels and faced northward; it appeared very similar in design to the principal pyramids at Chichen Itza and Mayapan in Yucat√°n. This was about half the size of the Mayapan castillo; its nine levels may each have been less than high; the pyramid would still have been imposing. It possibly had only one access stairway rather than the four radial stairways found in the examples in Yucat√°n. The pyramid was topped by a flat-roofed summit shrine that contained idols representing Itza gods. The dismantling of this pyramid would have required considerable effort but no mention of this is found in Spanish records.Jones 1998, p. 74. When Spanish missionary Andr√©s de Avenda√±o y Loyola visited the city in early 1696, nine of the temples had recently been burnt during a Kowoj Maya attack and subsequently rebuilt; during the attack many houses had also been destroyed.Jones 2009, p. 62.

A Cocom man named Ceel Cauich Ah was thrown into the cenote of Chichen Itza. The cenote is a deep hole filled with water. It is 15 meters from the ground to the water, and the walls are very steep. It is considered an entrance to the afterlife, and it is almost impossible to climb out. But Ceel managed to climb out. He proclaimed himself Ajaw, a spiritual and political leader. He also renamed himself Hunac Ceel Cauich. The Itzas did not recognize his authority. Ceel gathered many followers from Mayapan and the Cocom region. In 1194 Hunac Ceel Cauich declared war on Chac Chac Xib, one of four rulers of Chich√©n Itz√°. The other three brothers were Sac Xib Chac, Chac Ek Yuuan and Hun Yuuan Chac (also called uooh Puc).

The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of Kan Ek', who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the Cross and to destroy his idols.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Cort√©s accepted an invitation from the king to visit Nojpet√©n, and crossed to the Maya city with a small contingent of Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 762. Jones 2000, p. 358. Cort√©s left behind a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers but the animal soon died. =Early 17th century= Following Cort√©s' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpet√©n for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from M√©rida in Yucat√°n on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Pet√©n. Bartolom√© de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by the alcalde of Bacalar (a Spanish colonial official) and some Christianised Maya. After an arduous six- month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpet√©n for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert to Christianity. In the time since Cort√©s had visited Nojpet√©n, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed and the friars left Nojpet√©n on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 773. The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ek' welcomed them in a friendly manner; however the Maya priesthood were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never come back. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to M√©rida.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 774. =Interlude= In 1622 Captain Francisco de Mirones set out from Yucat√°n to launch an assault upon the Itza. His army was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. En route to Nojpet√©n, Delgado believed that the army's treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel and he left the army to make his own way to Nojpet√©n with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipu in Belize. When the party arrived at Nojpet√©n, they were all seized and sacrificed to the Maya gods. Soon afterwards, the Itza caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sacalum; they were slaughtered to a man. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. =Late 17th century= In 1695 the governor of Yucat√°n, Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a y Arizmendi, began to build a road from Campeche south towards Pet√©n. Franciscan Andr√©s de Avenda√±o followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpet√©n with local Maya guides.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 774-775. They arrived at the western end of Lake Pet√©n Itz√° to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors. The Franciscans returned to Nojpet√©n with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avenda√±o tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain. Kan Ek' learnt of a plot by a rival Itza group to ambush and kill the Franciscans and the Itza king advised them to return to M√©rida via Tipu.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 775. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships but eventually arrived back in M√©rida after a month travelling.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 775-776. Kan Ek' sent emissaries to M√©rida in December 1695 to inform Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. A Spanish party led by Captain Pedro de Zubiaur arrived at Lake Pet√©n Itza with 60 soldiers, friar San Buenaventura and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. Although they expected a peaceful welcome they were immediately attacked by approximately 2000 Maya warriors. San Buenaventura and one of his Franciscan companions, a Spanish soldier and a number of Yucatec Maya warriors were taken prisoner. Spanish reinforcements arrived the next day but were beaten back. This turn of events convinced Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a that Kan Ek' would not surrender peacefully and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpet√©n.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 776. = War with the Ko'woj = Topoxt√© was the secondary city of the Ko'woj, it was abandoned before the Spanish conquest In 1696 the Ko'woj kingdom launched an attack upon Nojpet√©n. The Itza were able to push the Ko'woj out of Nojpet√©n, but the city had been significantly damaged. = Conquest = Lake Peten Itza in 1697 Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a arrived at the lakeshore with a Spanish army on 1 March 1697 and built a fortified camp and an attack boat. On 10 March Kan Ek' sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Urs√∫a received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. Urs√∫a decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on 13 March.Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 777. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water.Sharer and Traxler 2006, pp. 777-778. Mart√≠n de Urs√∫a planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpet√©n as Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza (\\"Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza\\").Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 778. Jones 2009, p. 59. Kan Ek' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler.Jones 1998, p. 206. Urs√∫a returned to M√©rida, leaving Kan Ek' and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios y San Pablo. Reinforcements arrived from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala (modern Antigua Guatemala) in 1699 but they did not stay long due to an outbreak of disease. When they returned to the Guatemalan capital they took Kan Ek', his son and two of his cousins with them. The cousins died en route but the last Kan Ek' and his son spent the remainder of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.Jones 2009, p. 59.

Lord Sri Krishna is the main Prathishta in the temple.  Legend  The place Thalappulam has been renowned as the seat of spirituality from time immemorial. Thala means Head and 'pulam' means hamlet or Place . The meaning can be the land of lands or the place which is above other places. People of diverse cultures inhabited the land. They comprised Brahmanical,Sudra and Tribal origins. Consequent on internal feuds and fear of rivals gradually the Brahmins deserted the place searching for safer pastures. The tribals by nature led a nomadic way of life, never used to stick to a particular abode, drifted to other places. The remaining ‚ÄòSudras‚Äô were leading a serene, self-satisfied pastoral life devoting the time and resources for farming and agriculture.The people while following pastoral vocation in the fields, their iron tool struck up on something queer... Thereupon they stood stunning at the sight of the celestial spirit. Actually this might have caused to lay the foundation stone to the temple. The people of the hamlet were of both Vaishnava and Saiva sects. History The deity of Lord Krishna was formally deified by the Tantric priest from The Thazhmon Madomonhttp://www.janmabhumidaily.com/news556633/amp&rct;=j&sa;=U&ved;=0ahUKEwiKwOPy8NLUAhUPUI8KHRwKDJ4QFggbMAA&q; .ece 22nd Midhunam of 1078. The legend regarding this tells an interesting story... It is believed that the people in general wanted to have a Siva temple. It was not in complete unison with their will that the temple of Sreekrishna was deified there. The Thazhmon Tantri had brought from his Mana the Vigraha of Lord Krishna and got established there as the presiding deity. The Vigraha was once worshipped by a Brahmin woman who later entrusted it with the Thazhmon Madham. The spiritual longing to have Lord Siva as a dominant deity had consummated into the establishment of a temple for Lord Siva consequent on and as a solution for famine, calamities and epidemics. The vigraha of Lord Siva was ceremoniously consecrated on 26th Edavam of 1124. The shortcomings due to absence of a Goddess was overcome with the establishment of a sreekovil for the Goddess. The Nair family namely, Kochupurakkal had the administration and the ownership of the temple. Later a section of the family moved to temple neighborhood for administrative convenience.The Kochupurakkal families jointly resolved to hand over the administration and ownership of the temple and its land holdings to 196 N.S.S. Karayogam Thalappulam. The Karayuogam is now carrying forward the good work for the benefit of the worshippers of the whole Hindu community. Now a word about the deities and their uniqueness. The two deities are in duo mode, namely, Radha- Krishna/Parvathi-Parameswara... The devotees, therefore, come to worship the Gods in duo mode as husband and wife for having good progeny.The same vigraha which was brought from Thazhmon Madham will be ceremoniously re-consecrated in the new sreekovil by the Tantric priest from the same Brahmonical tharavadu, Thazhmon Madham after 111 years from its first introduction.

It was formed in 2014 by splitting the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation. Many other Indian metro towns in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Odisha and Chhattisgarh are also linked with the services of TSRTC. It serves about 100.03 lakh passengers every day, having three zones and services operating through 97 depots.  History  Road transport corporation in Telangana State was first established as NSRRTD (Nizam State Rail & Road Transport Department), a wing of Nizam State Railway in the erstwhile Hyderabad State, in 1932, with 27 buses and 166 employees. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) was established on 11 January 1958 in pursuance of the Road Transport Corporations Act 1950. Consequent upon bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh state into Telangana and residual Andhra Pradesh, TSRTC operated as a separate entity from 03.06.2015. The Government of Telangana has subsequently established Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), on 27.04.2016, under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. Divisions TSRTC has three zones: Hyderabad Rural (HR), Greater Hyderabad (GHZ) and Karimnagar (KRMR). It is further subdivided into 13 regions and 25 divisions. It has a fleet of 10,460 buses, of which around 2000 are hired vehicles. TSRTC buses undertake operations on 3,653 routes. Types of services TSRTC operates a number of different kinds of services, both for urban transport as well as intercity and village transport. = Premium services = Air-conditioned buses are branded \\"Vajra\\", \\"Vennela\\", \\"Garuda Plus\\", \\"Garuda\\" and \\"Rajadhani\\" (previously known as Indra). *Vajra TSRTC started its new service named Vajra with tag line 'Mobility Redefined' and 'Service At Doorstep'. The goal of Vajra was to reduce the hassle of commuters having to travel to a bus station in Hyderabad in order to board an intercity service. Vajra bridged that gap by providing intercity services from various colonies in Hyderabad to Warangal, Nizamabad, Godavarikhani and Karimnagar city. *Vennela Vennela is the most expensive service operated by TSRTC. Vennela translates to 'moonlight' in Telugu. These are Isuzu buses fabricated by JCB with sleeper berths arranged perpendicular to the body similar to a first-class train. Each berth has its own LED TV with pre-loaded movies. Value-added services include a 500ml water bottle, facial wipes, and a blanket. After the split from APSRTC, Vennela services were slowly losing traction and were eventually phased out. In its waning years, there were only three Vennela buses in TSRTC. All of them were operated to Bengaluru out of Hyderabad-3 depot in Musheerabad. Although not scrapped, all 3 buses are currently stabled and are no longer in regular service. A few other buses were downgraded into the Garuda brand. *Garuda Plus GARUDA Plus TSRTC operates multi-axle buses of Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Scania branded as Garuda Plus buses. Designed for superior ride quality, these buses have reclining seats, while a few older buses also have calf rests. There are two/three LED TVs in each coach with pre-loaded movies depending on the make. As in Vennela, passengers are given a 500ml water bottle, a blanket and a packet of facial wipes. TSRTC operates Garuda plus buses on intercity and interstate routes between urban centers such as Khammam-Bengaluru, Hyderabad- Adilabad, Hyderabad-Karimnagar, Hyderabad-Mumbai, Hyderabad-Vijayawada, Hyderabad-Bengaluru, Nizamabad-Bengaluru, Nizamabad-Tirupati, Warangal- Bengaluru, Godavarikhani-Bengaluru, Karimnagar-Bengaluru, Hyderabad-Pune, Hyderabad-Chennai, Hyderabad-Nagpur. *Garuda TSRTC operates bi-axle buses of Volvo and Isuzu make branded as Garuda. There have been no additions to the fleet since 2009 apart from a few Vennela which were downgraded as Garuda. This class of service is being phased out. Designed for superior ride quality, these buses have reclining seats. As in Vennela, passengers are given a 500ml water bottle, a blanket and a packet of facial wipes. Some popular Garuda routes are Hyderabad-Warangal and Karimnagar, Vijayawada. *Rajadhani Rajadhani TSRTC operates AC buses built on Ashok Leyland's 12M Viking chassis branded as Rajadhani. Introduced in 2011, these buses were earlier branded as Indra. Rajadhani buses act as a bridge between mid-level service \\"Super Luxury\\" and premium service \\"Garuda Plus\\". These buses are generally operated to state capital Hyderabad from various district headquarters. These are also operated on high-frequency long-distance routes. Only water bottles are provided in these buses. = Mid-level services = Metro Deluxe Mid-level services are branded \\"Super Luxury\\", \\"Deluxe\\" and \\"Express\\". * Super Luxury These are non- air conditioned 2+2 push back services which are run from major cities. These are video coaches in which various movies are played. Most of the buses are of Ashok Leyland, Tata, Eicher etc. * Deluxe These are non-air conditioned 2+2 services which are run as intercity services. The color of a Deluxe bus is violet. Most of the buses are of Ashok Leyland, Tata, Eicher, etc. * Express Express Bus These are non-air conditioned 3+2 services which are run as intercity services. The color of an Express bus is light blue and dark blue. Most of the buses are of Ashok Leyland, Tata, and Eicher. TSRTC runs city route buses in urban areas like Suryapet, Mahabubnagar, Siddipet, Godavarikhani and Khammam. = Entry-level services = Metro Express Entry- level ordinary service is branded as \\"Pallevelugu\\" and \\"Mini-Pallevelugu\\". These buses constitute the majority of TSRTC's fleet, and are used to provide connectivity to villages and small towns. Pallevelugu are typically used on short routes connecting villages and small towns to larger towns. = Urban services = City buses in Hyderabad and Warangal are also branded in a similar fashion. Air-conditioned city buses are branded \\"Metro Luxury\\" and \\"City Sheetal\\". The city buses to Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) are branded \\"Pushpak\\". Mid-level city services are branded \\"Metro Deluxe\\" and \\"Metro Express\\" whereas the entry-level \\"Ordinary\\" buses are not given any name but are commonly referred to as a \\"City Bus\\". These service categories should not be confused with local arrangements like \\"Merupu\\", \\"Trisul\\" and \\"Ramabanam\\". = Special Hire Services = TSRTC also provides buses for special hire to individuals and organisations for any purpose such as tours, pilgrimage, marriage transport, excursions etc.https://www.tsrtc.telangana.gov.in/HowtoCharteraBus.php. All kinds of buses are available for Special Hire, each with their own tariff rate.https://www.tsrtc.telangana.gov.in/TariffTable.php = Cargo Services = Cargo service In June 2020, TSRTC launched its Cargo Services in Telangana state. These cargo vehicles were refabricated from older, retired passenger buses, and were launched with the goal of transporting governmental goods such as books, departmental materials, question papers and answer sheets for educational institutions and other goods being supplied by the government. Each depot has been supplied with 2 cargo vehicles, and are available for hire by private parties as well. During the COVID-19 crisis, TSRTC cargo vehicles were used extensively to transport pharmaceuticals and medicinal supplies, as well as farm goods, groceries, and other logistics for the government.https://twitter.com/drusawasthi/status/1261934433650667526 Awards and achievements * Highest KMPL fuel efficiency for the year 2014-15TSRTC bags mileage awardTSRTC bags two major awards * Award for Excellence 2016 - Best Bus TransportationTSRTC gets award for excellenceTSRTC bags award for the second time  Accidents and incidents  * On 11 September 2018 India's worst bus tragedy took place in Telangana when a bus belonging to Jagtial depot was jam-packed with 88 passengers swerved off a ghat road and hurtled 30 feet down onto a valley at Sanivarampet killing 56 people and injuring 32 on board.

Plugging has been described as \\"the use of false numbers in financial ledgers that forces balances, and effectively masks accounting errors and control deficiencies\\". Consequence Plugging will make an analysis unreliable, resulting for example in a flawed ratio analysis, performance analysis and other attachments on a financial model like equity valuation, budgeting and loan appraisal, and debt structuring. Dependence on plugging has been described as \\"indicative of a dysfunctional finance and accounting system\\". Examples Accounting malpractice at the US Defense Department was investigated in 2013 by Reuters. At the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) superiors ordered accountants to make unsubstantiated change actions and enter false numbers. In the Cleveland DFAS office, unsupported adjustments to make balances agree totaled $1.03 billion in 2010 alone, according to a December 2011 General Accounting Office report. Difference to creative accounting Creative accounting may follow the letter of the rules of standard accounting practice, yet deviate by excessive complication creating opaqueness, whereas plugging the numbers deviates from accounting rules for a relatively \\"immaterial amount\\".

The Oak Point community is part of the Longview School District, a K-12 school district of about 6,600 students. Oak Point received its name from the fact George Vancouver and his men came across a grove of oak trees there. Local lore has it that the community was served by several saloons, a general store, and a post office in the late 19th century, A water powered lumber mill was once located on Mill Creek, near the intersection of Mill Creek Road and Ocean Beach Highway. A \\"one room\\" school house served the community until about 1964. The school actually had at least two large rooms and also served as a community center, hosting women's club meetings and community Christmas gatherings. A lumber camp was situated at the end of Hunter Road in the 19th century and a log flume is said to have transported logs to the mill, a distance of approximately 3 miles. Stumps of old growth trees cut during the logging camp's heyday, some of which are up to six feet in diameter, can still be seen throughout the area. Geography Oak Point is located at (46.1909435, -123.1887321). Oak Point is characterized by thickly forested hills, and steep canyons through which a number of small creeks run. Soil consists of a thin layer of black loam in forested areas and dense red clay throughout. Under the clay is usually found basalt rock a few feet down. The southern limit of the community is bordered by a steep cliff on the Columbia River. This cliff is several hundred feet high.

The Somalia-based Al-Shabaab militant group claimed responsibility, but the Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta asserted that the attacks were organized by local politicians with ties to a network of gangs. Correspondents from the area suggested that the attacks may have been motivated by ethnic or religious hatred, or revenge for land grabbing. First attack On 15 June 2014, about 50 masked gunmen hijacked a van and raided a police station in the predominantly Christian town of Mpeketoni, Kenya. According to a local policeman, the gunmen then shot men at random as women were forced to watch. The assailants also burned hotels, restaurants, and government offices. According to Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, the Mpeketoni police received warning of the attack ahead of time, but did not act on the warning. No on-duty police were killed in the attack and military reinforcements stationed away did not arrive until 10 hours after the attack, leading The Standard to declare the \\"government fed us to the dogs\\". The newspaper's investigation suggested police had ignored calls for help, in some cases turning off their radios. Others were watching World Cup games and did not receive notice of the situation. An eyewitness said he was told police vehicles did not have sufficient fuel to respond to his distress call. The police commissioner, who was reportedly suspended after the attack, stated \\"We responded robustly but we were overwhelmed.\\" After the attacks, angry local Kenyans brandishing weapons subsequently took to Mpeketoni's streets in protest. At least 53 people were reportedly killed during the attack, and eight others were unaccounted for as of 18 June. Most of the dead Kenyans were Kikuyus. Second attack On 17 June 2014, assailants set fire to houses in the villages of Majembeni and Poromoko, near Mpeketoni. Initial reports also said twelve women were abducted during the raid, although that was later proven incorrect. After the second attack, Kenyan security forces located a group of suspects armed with AK-47's fleeing from Mpeketoni. Five of the suspects were killed in a gun battle with security forces, while an undetermined number of others escaped. Perpetrators Although no group immediately claimed responsibility for the first attack, Kenyan army spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir said the \\"assailants [are] likely to be Al-Shabaab\\". Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the second attack, saying its members had killed 20 people. Kenyatta asserted that local politicians, who were connected with a network of gangs, had instigated the attacks, and dismissed Al- Shabaab's claim of responsibility. Many locals accused the Kenyan government of attempting to enrich Kikuyus by giving them land. This grievance was also behind the fatal ethnic violence that took place following the disputed 2007 Kenyan elections. President Kenyatta, a Kikuyu himself, described the attacks as \\"politically motivated ethnic violence against a Kenyan community, with the intention of profiling and evicting them for political reasons\\". The opposition leader Raila Odinga, who Kenyatta had defeated in the 2013 general election, denied involvement in the violence and suggested that Kenyatta's remarks were \\"unfortunate and unjustified\\". Correspondents from the area conjectured that ethnic Somali or Oromo residents may have perpetrated the attack and attempted to deflect blame onto Al-Shabaab by using the group's flag as a guise. On 25 June, Lamu County Governor Issa Timamy was arrested on charges related to the attack.

He is also remembered as a reputed theatre ghost in Australia. Early in his career, Federici worked as a talent agent before becoming a concert singer. From 1879 to 1887 he toured extensively in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. His roles included the Pirate King from The Pirates of Penzance appearing in the opera's first performance in 1879. He also played, among other roles, Captain Corcoran in H.M.S. Pinafore, Colonel Calverley in Patience, Strephon in Iolanthe and Florian in Princess Ida. He appeared in the title role in The Mikado (1885) and as Sir Roderic in Ruddigore (1887) in the first authorised American productions of those works. In 1887, Federici moved to Australia where he played in Gilbert and Sullivan and other operas with the J. C. Williamson company. His last role was Mephistopheles in Gounod's opera Faust at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne in March 1888. On opening night, after he sang the last note of the opera, and as he descended through a trap door in the stage, he had a heart attack and died suddenly.

However, as Federici was being lowered down into the basement, he had a heart attack and died within minutes. He was 37 years old. The Press of Melbourne wrote about Federici's career, performance and the events of the evening: > The tragic and appalling occurrence ... must command universal sympathy and > regret. Mr Federici achieved considerable success both in England and > America in comic opera, but he was also an excellent musician and the > composer of several songs of more than average merit, and before his > association with comic opera had successfully appeared as a vocalist at some > of the best concerts in London, including the Monday Popular Concerts at St. > James's Hall.

Federici's grave in Melbourne General Cemetery The Argus newspaper in Melbourne, among many other press reports, carried a detailed account of the incident. It noted that soon after he collapsed, Federici was carried to the theatre's green room, where his doctor was unable to revive him and pronounced him dead. The cast onstage, like the audience, were unaware of his sudden death, but when they were told of what had happened at the end of the opera, they reportedly said that he had just been onstage and taken the bows with them.The Theatre Ghost ‚Äì Australian Broadcasting Corporation (2004)\\"Top Ten Haunted Places in Australia\\", Haunted America Tours website, accessed 16 June 2014\\"The Princess Theatre in Melbourne\\", Melbourne for Everyone, accessed 16 June 2014 Since then, members of the theatre's staff have claimed to see a ghostly figure in evening dress at the theatre.

It runs from North Terrace in the north to Angas Street, and then as Regent Street North to Carrington Street in the south. North of North Terrace, Frome Street continues towards North Adelaide as Frome Road. Built in the early 1960s, the street was named after Edward Charles Frome, who was Surveyor General of South Australia for most of the 1840s. History Frome Street was not part of the William Light's plan for Adelaide, and did not exist as a main street until the 1960s. It has a disjointed and winding structure compared to the planned arterial roads. The Adelaide City Council planned Frome Street to extend from Frome Road as part of a link from Main North Road to Glen Osmond Road, to relieve traffic congestion in King William Street. The street was developed by 1962, by widening Tavistock Street (North Terrace to Rundle Street) and Ackland Street (Grenfell Street to Wakefield Street) and purchasing properties in between. In the 1970s the state government halted the development, so the street only extends part way across the city centre. Frome Road, of which Frome Street is a continuation, was named after Edward Charles Frome, Surveyor-General for most of the 1840s. Frome Street Bikeway Cyclists on Frome Street, including the Bikeway (2014) In 2014, the southern part of Frome Street was modified to create separated bike lanes between the parallel car parking and the footpath. These lanes connect with minor laneways to the south and a path across the Adelaide Parklands as the Frome Street Bikeway. By June 2014, the separated bike lanes extended as far north as Pirie Street, with community consultation yet to occur for extension further north. In 2017‚Äì18, the bikeway was extended to Grenfell Street (completed February 2018), and part of what had already been built was removed and relaid to match. There were some calls to remove the city's first separated bikeway, but after the Adelaide Design Manual was produced, followed by the Bikeways Design Guide, the state government gave the City a grant to help it rebuild the Frome Street bikeway as well as a new east‚Äìwest cycling corridor. The City matched the amount for its own spend on the project. , the Frome Street Bikeway is being integrated into the North-South Bikeway, which is \\"build[ing] on the existing Frome Bikeway and will connect the existing Rugby/Porter Bikeway in Unley to the Braund Road Bike Boulevard in Prospect\\".

It covered an area of approximately 1,365 km2 and was bounded on the north by the dominions of Dungarpur and Banswara in Rajputana. On the east was the sub division of Jhalod in the Panch Mahals. On the south it touched the small state of Sanjeli while on the west it was bounded by the State of Lunavada.  History  According to bardic history, the state was founded in c. 1255 by an individual named Sant who had been forced to leave Jhalod upon the military defeat of his father, Jalamsingh. Sant's brother, Limdev, founded the nearby state of Kadana. In 1753, The Maharawal of Banswara State, killed the three sons of Rana Ratansinhjii and tried to capture the throne of Sant State; the fourth son who was an infant named Badansinghji was hidden by Kolis of Malwa and grew up in a Koli family. The Maharawal annexed the Sant State in Banswara State and established his army in Sant. After several years, when Badansinghji reached maturity, the Kolis of Malwa attacked the army of Banswara. The Khant Kolis of Malwa defeated the army of Maharawal and threw it out of Sant state. After that, Kolis of Malwa established Rana Badansinghji Pawar at the throne of Sant State. In 1803, Sant State entered into a defensive treaty with the British Government, but the latter subsequently reneged on the treaty under Lord Cornwallis' policy of not entering alliances with Indian states. Thereafter, on 10 August 1819, Sant State was party to an agreement between Scindia and Lunawada mediated by the British, which effectively made the state a British vassal. The state was placed under the administration of the Rewa Kantha Rewa Kantha Agency in 1825. In 1913, the state was rocked by an adivasi (Bhil) uprising led by Govindgiri. The last ruler of Sant State signed the accession to the Indian Union on 10 June 1948, by which the state ceased to exist and merged into Gujarat, and was assigned a Privy purse of 112,000 Rupees.

Today's Baroque building was completed in 1746 by Minister of State Johan Ludvig Holstein (1694‚Äì1763) who commissioned J.C. Krieger to carry out the work. History and architecture Ledreborg (1873) The first reference to Lejreborg is fairly recent, dating to 1523 when Otto Tinhuus owned the property under the Diocese of Copenhagen. At the time, the estate was called Udlejre and consisted of four or five farms. After the Reformation, in 1545 Lejre became a fief in its own right under the jurisdiction of Copenhagen. In 1663, the statesman Henrik M√ºller purchased eight farms and five houses in Lejre including Udlejre. He presented the property to his daughter Drude and her husband, statesman Thomas Finke, who built a house called Lejreg√•rd. In 1661, Udlejreg√•rd was bought by the statesman Henrik M√ºller who built the first Lejreg√•rd manor house. in 1739, Johan Ludvig Holstein bought the property and developed the modest building into one of the country's finest mansions. He commissioned Johan Cornelius Krieger to extend the building to the east and west. Krieger also added a chapel and a monumental staircase designed by Jacob Fortling. In 1745, Niels Eigtved developed the interior, including the Rokoko banqueting hall, while Lauritz de Thurah decorated the inner courtyard with two pavilions and obelisk-shaped lampposts. A gatehouse was also added. Gardens The terraced gardens of Ledreborg Palace Also designed by Krieger from 1742 until the mid-1750s, the terraced Baroque park extends from the mansion down the steep slopes of the Kornerup Valley. In the wooded area to the east, the Dyrehaven was laid out in 1757‚Äì1762 with paths leading past sculptures and obelisks in line with the trends of the time. The terraced garden was completely renovated in 2004‚Äì2006 with a waterfall and fountain designed by Erik Heide who also included sculptures of Adam and Eve. Ledreborg today The mansion can now be rented for meetings or conferences which can be accommodated in the banqueting hall or in the spacious reworked barn. Every August since 1994, the Danish National Chamber Orchestra has held popular concerts of film music and musicals in Ledreborg Park which enjoys exceptionally good acoustics.

The one-shots in the series were written by Grant Morrison, each with a different artist. The Multiversity began in August 2014 and ran until April 2015. Background and creation In the conclusion to the 1985 comic book crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths, the DC Multiverse collapsed, merging the history of five universes into one single new universe. In the 1998‚Äì1999 series The Kingdom, author Mark Waid and co- creator Grant Morrison introduced the concept of Hypertime, a super- dimensional construct that allowed for all publications to be canon or in- continuity somewhere. Hypertime, although infrequently used, was a replacement and explanation for the multiple timelines and histories DC had published through the years. In the 2005‚Äì06 crossover event Infinite Crisis, the survivors of the first Crisis‚ÄîAlexander Luthor, Jr. from Earth-Three, Superboy-Prime from Earth-Prime, and Kal-L of Earth-Two‚Äîhad attempted to create a perfect world to replace the current DC Universe (DCU), with Luthor restoring, merging, and destroying worlds that had once existed in the Multiverse or were featured in various Elseworlds publications. Luthor failed, due to the intervention of the universe's heroes, and inadvertently altered the history of the DC Universe. Following Infinite Crisis, a single Earth and universe existed in the DCU as a result of Luthor's actions, however, it was later revealed that this was not actually the case and that the Multiverse still existed at this time. Prior to the publication of Infinite Crisis, editor Dan DiDio revealed that Hypertime no longer exists in the DCU. Following Infinite Crisis, the year-long weekly maxiseries 52 (2006‚Äì2007) led to the revelation that the Multiverse still exists, in the form of 52 alternate universes. Author Grant Morrison stated that the return of the Multiverse was intended to launch new franchises, explaining: In 2007‚Äì08, the weekly series Countdown (a.k.a. Countdown to Final Crisis) was published as a follow up to 52 and lead-in to DC's next line-wide crossover event Final Crisis, along with various spin-off titles featuring the new Multiverse. The Multiverse plays a large part in the Final Crisis (2008‚Äì2009) series, where a team of Supermen from across the Multiverse assemble to defeat a rogue Monitor, Mandrakk. The series introduced Calvin Ellis, a new Superman from Earth-23 who is the President of the United States. Grant Morrison based the character on Barack Obama. The character would later appear in Grant Morrison's Action Comics #9 (July 2012) and was a central character in The Multiversity. Final Crisis was described by editor Dan DiDio as the finale in a trilogy of stories about the Multiverse, describing each Crisis: \\"The death of the Multiverse, the rebirth of the Multiverse, and now the ultimate story of the Multiverse.\\" When asked about his future role in expanding the Multiverse following Final Crisis, Morrison stated: \\"I'm in the early stages of putting together material for a Multiverse series but I want to spend a lot of time getting it exactly right, so there are currently no deadlines and I don't anticipate any of this coming out until 2010.\\" Morrison later revealed that he had been working on a new book set on Earth-4, featuring Charlton Comics characters, but inspired by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons's 1986 limited series Watchmen, which in turn was proposed initially as being based on Charlton Comics characters. In Wizard #212 (April 2009), Morrison detailed his project, The Multiversity, intended for publication in 2010. Morrison states that the series: \\"will pick up a bunch of strands from 52 and Final Crisis.\\" He noted that his work would include a one-shot for each of seven different universes, where they \\"all link together as a seven-issue story that re- imagines the relationship between the DCU and the Multiverse.\\" Morrison provided Jeffrey Renaud of Comic Book Resources with further details, explaining the reasoning behind the project: \\"The idea was to do seven books that would be #1 issues for seven different teams on seven different Earths. Each of these would be the bible for what could potentially be an entire comic line for each of these Earths.\\" Originally, his co-writers (Geoff Johns, Mark Waid, and Greg Rucka) on 52 were to have participated in the project. In 2010, it was revealed that Morrison's frequent collaborators Cameron Stewart and Frank Quitely were, at the time, the only artists chosen for The Multiversity. Quitely would illustrate Pax Americana, featuring Morrison's reworking of the Charlton characters, based on Earth-4. Stewart's one-shot would be Thunderworld, focusing on Captain Marvel of Earth-5. Artist Frazer Irving stated that Morrison \\"reserved a small part of my soul\\" to do work on The Multiversity. In 2011, DC Comics announced that its entire line of publications would be cancelled following Flashpoint (2011), leading into a rebooted DC Universe known as The New 52. The finale of Flashpoint #5 (September 2011) saw three distinct universes from the Multiverse‚ÄîWildStorm Universe, Vertigo, and the DC Universe‚Äîmerge into one universe, designated 'Prime Earth' (also later stated to be designated as Earth-33 as well). Dan DiDio clarified that there was still a Multiverse, but gave no details on how it had changed and suggested that The Multiversity might provide answers. Morrison later revealed that The Multiversity would not be out until 2012, noting that Quitely had just begun working on his issue. Morrison also gave a definitive length for the series, nine one-shots, where two are book-ends with the other seven each focusing on a different universe. Tonally, Morrison has described The Multiversity as feeling similar to his work on Seven Soldiers (2005). In September 2012, as part of MorrisonCon, DC Entertainment officially confirmed The Multiversity, giving the series a publication date of late 2013. It was also revealed that the series would feature eight one-shot issues, each issue being 38 pages plus an eight-page backup. Morrison also confirmed that The Multiversity had not been affected by anything in The New 52, but would still feature a \\"little sort of wave over to the DC Universe,\\" and that The New 52 fits \\"really nicely into the scheme without doing any damage.\\" In February 2013, Morrison stated that he had created a guidebook for DC's Multiverse, incorporating all 52 alternate universes, which other authors reference when working with the Multiverse concept. The guidebook was included as the sixth installment of The Multiversity and was published in January 2015; it contained maps and blueprints to the Multiverse as well as brief descriptions of the meta-humans that populate 45 out of its 52 alternate Earths (with details about Earths 14, 24, 25, 27, 28, 46 and 49 omitted entirely). The only information given in Multiversity about these seven planets is that, in each case, the Earths were 'Created by an Inner Chamber of 7 Monitor Magi for a mysterious purpose yet to be revealed.' Publication history In April 2014, The Multiversity was announced for publication in August 2014. The announcement also revealed more of the series' artists including Chris Sprouse, Karl Story, Ben Oliver, Frank Quitely, Cameron Stewart, Ivan Reis, and Joe Prado. In May 2014, the first issue, by artists Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, was officially solicited by DC Comics. Each subsequent one-shot was published monthly. In July 2014, during San Diego Comic-Con International, DC Comics held a panel titled \\"The Multiversity Enrollment\\", featuring creators Grant Morrison and Cameron Stewart with editor Eddie Berganza. Posters, featuring a map of the Multiverse, designed by Morrison and Rian Hughes, were handed out to attendees of the panel. DC later included a version of the map as a \\"Channel 52\\" exclusive at the end of books published in the week of July 28, 2014. In May 2015, a director's cut of the Pax Americana one-shot was published. Synopsis The Multiversity featured a story arc about the DC Comics Multiverse being invaded by a race of cosmic parasites known as the Gentry. The Gentry come from beyond the immediate DC \\"local\\" multiverse, and each member is a cultural fear or \\"bad idea\\" personified as a living, demonic entity. Intellectron is the immoral genius; Demogorgunn is the mindless, sprawling horde; Hellmachine is unchecked, uncontrollable technology; Dame Merciless is the ultimate extreme of the femme fatale; and Lord Broken is insanity and despair. The Gentry were drawn to the Multiverse by the emanations of ruined dreams and negative ideas and they seek to seize ownership of every single mind in existence and, in so doing, to control all thoughts and stories. To this end, they create and use Ultra Comics #1, a \\"haunted\\" comic book that can affect and even control its readers, as a vector to infect the Multiverse as well as simultaneously launch an attack on every Earth in the Orrery of Worlds. Various heroes from across the Multiverse are forced to band together, calling themselves Justice Incarnate, to face this extra-dimensional threat and initiate the \\"Battle for All Creation.\\" Structure The series contains nine issues and consists of six one-shots, a guidebook containing a map of the Multiverse and entries describing each of the 52 Earths, and a two-part story bookending the one- shots and serving as a prologue and conclusion‚Äîwhich Morrison described as an \\"80-page giant DC super-spectacular story.\\" Each one-shot takes place in a different universe, and each publication features different trade dress and a different storytelling approach. Morrison explains: \\"each comic looks like it comes from a different parallel world, so they're all slightly different.\\" Morrison stated that when developing the series, he had to think of a way for the featured universes to communicate with each other. He recalled the \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" storyline from The Flash #123, where the adventures of the Golden Age Flash (Jay Garrick of Earth-2) were documented as a comic book on Earth-1. He incorporated this device into The Multiversity, stating \\"they're reading each other's adventures, so there's some way that if a real big emergency arises, they can communicate using comic books. So each world has a comic from the previous world which has clues to the disaster that's coming their way, and they all have to basically start communicating using writers and artists so it's my big, big statement.\\" Morrison further explained how the device was used to create a cohesive story: \\"[I]t's almost like a baton race or a relay race where each of the worlds can read a comic book that's published in their world but which tells the adventures of the previous world. The characters are actually reading the series along with the readers.\\" =The Multiversity #1= The first chapter, illustrated by Ivan Reis, Joe Prado, and Nei Ruffino, The Multiversity features heroes from all 52 of the Earths in the DC Universe coming together to battle an attack by the Gentry on the Multiverse. Morrison described The Multiversity as a big team book, featuring characters from all over the Multiverse, and featuring a team that looks \\"after the welfare of the entire multiverse and they're headquartered in a place called the Multiversity.\\" Morrison compared the team to a Justice League of the Multiverse. The team includes characters such as Earth-26's Captain Carrot as well as Thunderer, an Aboriginal version of Marvel Comics' Thor from Earth-7. The story involves Monitor Nix Uotan travelling to Earth-7 only to find it destroyed with Thunderer as its only living superhero. Uotan is attacked and turned into an evil version of himself by the intergalactic monsters of the Gentry. The story then switches to Earth-23 and features Calvin Ellis, the Superman of this world, being pulled into a parallel universe \\"doorway\\" created by Earth-23's Lex Luthor, sending Ellis to the Hall of Heroes (or Multiversity), an interdimensional gathering place for heroes from all 52 Earths. The Hall is also referred to as Valla-Hal and Monitor Station Infinity. It is here Ellis meets heroes from the rest of the Multiverse who have also been summoned there as well and travels to Earth-8 to try and stop the Gentry's invasion. The story ends with the appearance of an evil Nix Uotan on Earth-8, a version of Uotan that has been corrupted by the Gentry. The Multiversity #1 was published in August 2014. =The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World= The second chapter, illustrated by Chris Sprouse and Karl Story, The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World (\\"SOS\\") features the Society of Super-Heroes from Earth-20 and their villainous counterparts from Earth-40. The Society of Super-Heroes is a pulp-style Justice Society of America, led by Doc Fate, and had previously appeared in Superman Beyond. Morrison describes him as \\"kind of a Doc Savage-come-Doctor Fate guy who teams with the Mighty Atom, the Immortal Man, Lady Blackhawk and her Blackhawks, and Abin Sur, the Green Lantern. It's all kind of a 1940s retro thing. As I say, it's a pulp take on superheroes,\\" along with other recreated \\"primitive pulp characters\\". Morrison described this Earth as having a population of only \\"two billion people, even though it's 2012, as a result of a recent global war akin to World War II on Earth-20, albeit directed against a scion of the al-Ghul dynasty and an alliance of Arab/Islamic states called the \\"Desert Crescent\\". The story begins with Doctor (Doc) Fate assembling a group that includes the Immortal Man, the Atom of Earth-20 (The Mighty Atom), an all-female version of the Blackhawks and Green Lantern Abin Sur to face the threat of parallel Earth-40 being on a \\"collision course\\" with their own world. It is revealed that Earth-20 and Earth-40 share a binary orbit which causes their separate realities to overlap every 100,000 years. Earth-40 invades and devastates Earth-20, waging a global war against the Society of Super-Heroes in defense of their alternate universe. After five years of fighting, Doc Fate and his S.O.S. team are able to thwart a plan by Vandal Savage, Felix Faust, Parallax, Lady Shiva and an army of Savage's undead Necro-Men to conquer Earth-20. Immortal Man stabs and kills Vandal Savage with a piece of the fallen meteorite that gave them both their powers thousands of years before. Savage is revealed to have planned and desired his own death, however, as the spilling of his immortal blood opens a gateway to the larger Multiverse. After remaining dormant for 3,000 years, a giant stone statue named Niczhuotan rises from the ground, re-animates and begins to speak. The story ends with Immortal Man calling out an S.O.S. for anyone on parallel Earths to come together and fight the coming invasion of Gentry forces. The Society of Super-Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World was published in September 2014. =The Just= The third chapter, illustrated by Ben Oliver, The Just features a world of legacy characters and children of superheroes from Earth-16, such as Connor Hawke and the Super-Sons. \\"This is those guys but they're not the main heroes. There's a whole younger generation of heroes‚Äîkind of media brats almost.\\" Morrison describes them as \\"children of superheroes‚Äîa son of Superman, a son of Batman, et cetera‚Äîwho exist in a world where they have incredible abilities, but the previous generation had ushered in a utopia, so they don't really have any notion of where to direct it, and they're very unhappy with the world as is.\\" Morrison cites MTV's The Hills as his inspiration for The Just. Morrison described the idea: \\"What happens when your mom and dad fix everything? Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman have kind of fixed everything so the kids have nothing to do\\", instead resorting to battle reenactments, \\"these kids, they dress up but they've never fought anything.\\" Morrison had originally conceptualized a \\"Super-Sons\\" story as part of his All-Star Superman series, where Superman and Batman had stopped all crime, noting that \\"[o]ne day, I might get to them or some version of it. There's a little bit of that in the \\"Multiversity\\" series that I'm doing\\". Morrison originally designated this universe as Earth-11. The one-shot was published in October 2014. In this chapter of the story, Dame Merciless is the Gentry member who is assigned to this world, working confusion and disorientation into the lives of Kyle Rayner/Green Lantern, Alexis Luthor and Offspring, as well as appearing in a piece of artwork by Kon-El/Superboy. =Pax Americana= The fourth chapter, illustrated by Frank Quitely, Pax Americana: In Which We Burn takes place on Earth-4 and features characters from Charlton Comics. It has been described by Morrison as: \\"if Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons had pitched the Watchmen now, rooted in a contemporary political landscape.\\" Rather than the Cold War focus of Watchmen, the title's focus is on international terrorism and conspiracy in a world of superheroes. The story is told with an eight-panel grid, similar to Watchmens nine-panel grid layout. The story is based around musical harmonics, as each world in the Multiverse vibrates at a different frequency, with Quitely explaining: \\"music, and vibration‚Ä¶ musical vibrations, the octave, the eight as a repeated motive, and creating patterns leading the eye around the page in a specific way.\\" Morrison describes Pax Americana as his Citizen Kane. The Captain Atom of this universe had been introduced in Final Crisis as his world's analogue to Superman. Morrison describes the Question as \\"a little bit like Rorschach but absolutely nothing like Rorschach.\\" Peacemaker is described as a good guy, but he assassinates the President of the United States. The story revolves around the assassination and the failures on the part of the Charlton characters. The one-shot was published in November 2014. =Thunderworld Adventures= The fifth chapter, illustrated by Cameron Stewart, Thunderworld Adventures takes place on Earth-5 and features characters from the Captain Marvel family. Morrison described this book as \\"a classic Shazam book but it's done in a way almost like a Pixar movie or the way we did All Star Superman. It captures the spirit of those characters without being nostalgic or out of date.\\" Morrison called it his \\"attempt to see if you can get the pure note of Captain Marvel, with no irony and no camp and just make it work for everyone. It's like a myth, a little folk tale. It's pure.\\" The one-shot was published in December 2014. In this chapter, Doctor Sivana reads a copy of The Society of Super- Heroes: Conquerors of the Counter-World, and the comic book inspires him to recruit an army of alternate versions of himself from across the multiverse. Sivana and the Legion of Sivanas pool their resources to develop synthetic, crystallized time called Suspendium, and they use their invention to create an eighth day of the calendar week called Sivanaday. Sivana then pilots a gigantic, technological copy of the Rock of Eternity into the heart of the Multiverse and captures the wizard Shazam. Sivana's machinations result in time distortions all over Fawcett City. While reporting for WHIZ Media, Billy Batson sees a vision of himself from the future, warning his past self to keep careful track of time. Billy is suddenly attacked by Doctor Sivana's children: Magnificus, Thaddeus Sivana Jr., and Georgia, all of whom have been given superpowers to rival the Marvel Family. Billy transforms into Captain Marvel and battles the Sivanas and the Monster Society of Evil with assistance from Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., the Lieutenant Marvels, and Mr. Tawky Tawny. Captain Marvel journeys through the Multiverse to the Rock of Eternity to put a stop to Sivana's scheme. He discovers that Sivana has stolen the secret of Shazam's magic lightning, and Sivana becomes a hulking, musclebound brute called Black Sivana. Black Sivana appears to be winning the fight, but Captain Marvel transforms back into Billy Batson and uses the Suspendium crystals to transmit a message back through time. The meaning of the message is revealed: each member of the Legion of Sivanas stole Suspendium from the group, depriving Sivanaday of the full 24 hours needed to last a complete day. Sivanaday runs out of time and Sivana loses his powers. Having saved the day, Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family fly off to their next big adventure. =Guidebook= The sixth chapter, illustrated by various artists, featured the Multiversity Guidebook, consisting of detailed entries on all 52 Earths, a map showcasing \\"all known existence\\", and a history of the \\"Crisis\\" events. The one-shot was published in 80-Page Giant format in January 2015. In this chapter, the Little League of the chibi Earth-42 is attacked by the Legion of Sivanas. The Batman of Earth-42 must team up with the displaced Batman of the post-apocalyptic Earth-17 to escape from the Sivanas' army of killer robots. While the Batmen attempt to activate the device used by the Sivanas for crossing from Earth to Earth, the Batman of Earth-42 learns about events transpiring on Earth-51 by reading about them in the Multiversity Guidebook comic, where they appear as fictional characters. On Earth-51, Kamandi, Prince Tuftan, and Ben Boxer investigate a mysterious tomb on the Island of the God- Watchers. They are observed from afar by the New Gods of Supertown, who identify the tomb as the place where Darkseid was caged and contained. It is revealed by the New Gods of Earth-51 that they can exist across the Multiverse as \\"emanations.\\" It is also revealed that Darkseid has been freed from his tomb by the Monitor Nix Uotan ‚Äì unleashed to assume new forms and spread evil across all reality. The Batman of Earth-17 escapes to the House of Heroes with the Multiversity Guidebook, only to arrive just as Gentry member Hellmachine launches an all-out assault. The slain members of the Little League return to life, commanded to live and die over and over again by the unseen master of the Gentry: the all-powerful \\"Empty Hand.\\" =Mastermen= The seventh chapter, illustrated by Jim Lee and Scott Williams, Mastermen, takes place on Earth-10, and features characters from Quality Comics as part of the Freedom Fighters and Nazi versions of various heroes. The concept is borrowed from Earth-X, a universe where Nazi Germany won World War II, featured in stories before Crisis on Infinite Earths. Morrison describes this one-shot as a \\"big, dark Shakespearean story.\\" The members of this world's Freedom Fighters include a Jewish Phantom Lady, a homosexual Ray, and an African Black Condor, with other members also being representative of groups targeted by the Nazis, such as Doll Man and Doll Woman, who are Jehovah's Witnesses. Overman, the Superman of this world, landed on Earth in 1939 in Nazi territory and was raised by Adolf Hitler. The story is set around a utopia built by this world's Superman after he realizes the evil nature of Hitler; this Superman \\"knows his entire society, though it looks utopian, was built on the bones of the dead. Ultimately it's wrong and it must be destroyed.\\" The one-shot was published in February 2015. In this chapter, Kal-L landed in the contested Sudetenland in 1939 and his ship was discovered by the Nazis. Kal-L is dubbed Overman by Adolf Hitler and is raised to be a living super-weapon and a symbol of Nazi supremacy. In April 1956, Overman presided over the fall of the United States amidst the devastation of Washington, D.C. Sixty years later, in 2016, Overman is a member of the New Reichsmen, his world's version of the Justice League, which consists of the Valkyrie Brunnhilde (an alternate Wonder Woman), Underwaterman (an alternate Aquaman), Leatherwing (an alternate Batman whose grandfather was Hans von Hammer, the protagonist of Enemy Ace), Blitzen/Lightning (an alternate version of the Flash, who is a female speedster), the Martian (an alternate Martian Manhunter), and unnamed alternate versions of Green Lantern and the Red Tornado. The world is a technologically advanced utopia, built on the genocide of millions. The guilt- ridden Overman is haunted by the death of his cloned sister, Overgirl, and has recurring nightmares of a towering, ruined house ‚Äì Lord Broken of the Gentry. After the Human Bomb attacks an Overgirl memorial in Metropolis, Overman and the Reichsmen attempt to uncover the truth behind a new terrorist organization called the Freedom Fighters and their leader, the mysterious figure known only as \\"Uncle Sam.\\" Uncle Sam warns of a terrible revenge for the Nazi atrocities of the past, and the Reichsmen suspect that they have a traitor on the team. Overman has growing doubt about his cause, but prepares to attend a performance of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen with his wife, Lena. Uncle Sam carries out his master plan, and the Human Bomb detonates on board the Reichsmen's orbiting satellite base. The damaged satellite falls to Earth, and Overman is unable to stop it from crashing into the city of Metropolis. Millions die from the crash and the city is utterly destroyed with Overman as the only survivor, left alone in a crater of ash. This destruction of Metropolis is said to mark \\"the beginning of the end\\" of the Nazi empire. =Ultra Comics= The eighth chapter, illustrated by Doug Mahnke and Christian Alamy, Ultra Comics takes place on Earth-33 (aka Earth-Prime) and features Ultraa, the first superhero of this world. Earth-33 serves in the DC Universe as a version of the \\"real world\\" (the readers' Earth), a planet with no superheroes other than those appearing in comic books. On Earth-33, there is even a DC Comics that publishes the stories of the heroes of the Multiverse as comics, particularly the stories of heroes from Earth-1 and Earth-2. Morrison describes this book as \\"the most advanced thing I've ever done. I'm so excited about this. It's just taking something that used to be done in comics and captions that they don't do anymore and turning it into a technique, a weapon, but beyond that I don't want to say. It's a haunted comic book, actually, it's the most frightening thing anyone will ever read. It's actually haunted‚Äîif you read this thing, you'll become possessed.\\" This one- shot was published in March 2015. The eighth chapter of the series concerns the creation of Ultra Comics: a synthetic, completely fictional comic book superhero created by \\"memesmiths\\" to battle and defeat a dangerous idea designated as a Hostile Independent Thought-Form. After exploring the ruins of a bizarre, post-apocalyptic New York City, Ultra Comics is betrayed and the Hostile Independent Thought is revealed to be Intellectron of the Gentry. Collaborating with the Gentry are the \\"Neighbourhood Guard\\", a group of feral, cannibal children, and other versions of Ultra characters from the DC Multiverse, including Ultra-Man, Ultra the Multi-Alien and several others. The Ultras all serve Ultraa, consort of Maxima and joint ruler of her homeworld of Almerac. Ultra Comics is ultimately destroyed by Intellectron, but not before Ultra Comics is able to capture Intellectron and contain it in the last page of the comic ‚Äì effectively sealing it inside the end of the narrative. The final caption ominously warns the reader that their mind has become infected simply by reading the comic. =The Multiversity #2= The ninth and final chapter, illustrated by Ivan Reis and Joe Prado, The Multiversity #2 features the final battle between the Gentry and the combined superheroes of the DC Comics Multiverse, under the name of Justice Incarnate. The issue was published in April 2015. The corrupted Monitor Nix Uotan opens doorways across the Multiverse that allow the Gentry to complete their invasion, despite attacks from Aquawoman, Thunderer, President Superman, Captain Carrot, Red Racer, and the Retaliators of Earth-8. Ultimately, Nix Uotan is freed from Gentry control by the Red Racer, working in tandem with every speedster superhero in existence. Uotan reveals that he resisted the Gentry while under their control and arranged for the same doorways that summoned the Gentry to summon the champions of the Multiverse. The Harbinger AI from the House of Heroes transmits a cosmic SOS across every Earth, calling on all superheroes everywhere to rise to the defense of their worlds. The Gentry are defeated and driven back. A small group of superheroes pursue the Gentry to the ruined world of Earth-7, where they discover that the members of the Gentry that they fought were merely part of a vast legion of Gentries. The Gentries labor to complete a Multiverse-destroying doomsday weapon called the Oblivion Machine and are watched over by their master - a shadowy, unknowable entity called \\"the Empty Hand.\\" The Empty Hand informs the gathered heroes that its assessment of the Multiverse is finished and it then effortlessly banishes the heroes from Earth-7. Back at the House of Heroes, the assembled super-beings of the Multiverse vow to work together to protect their worlds from future threats to reality. Organized by President Superman of Earth-23, they form a pan-universal super-team called Justice Incarnate. The superheroes offer to reward Nix Uotan for his role in the rescue of multi-trillions of lives. At first, Nix Uotan declines, but then he remembers something and asks for a small favor. The story ends with Nix in his human form, waking from a dream, now able to pay the $800 that he owed his landlord with money given to him by the heroes of the Multiverse. Collected editions The series has been collected into a single volume: *The Multiversity Deluxe Edition (collects all issues of The Multiversity, 448 pages, hardcover, October 21, 2015, ) Future On the future of the Multiverse, Morrison explained, \\"each one of the episodes also sets up a potential series. You could do a Multiverse range of books out of this. All of them are designed to be issue one of potential long-running series as well as being self-contained. It's been a storytelling challenge, but the whole idea is to set stuff up for future development ‚Äì not necessarily by me, but by DC in some way.\\" At San Diego Comic-Con International 2015, Morrison announced a series of original graphic novels under the title Multiversity Too. The series will continue to be written by Morrison, with the first entry, Multiversity Too: The Flash scheduled to debut in 2016. In December 2017, Morrison noted the project was on hold. He added, \\"I felt there was a lot of great Flash material in comics and on TV so I left my take on the table for a while. I'll get to it eventually.\\" References Category:Comics about parallel universes ","title":"The Multiversity"},{"id":"43066470","title":"Artin transfer (group theory)"},{"id":"43066498","text":"Portrait of Henri van Abbe by (1929) Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven Henri Jacob van Abbe (;In isolation, van is pronounced . 8 January 1880 ‚Äì 18 November 1940) was a Dutch tobacco industrialist and art collector.

He was in the original productions of Caste by T. W. Robertson, and Engaged by W. S. Gilbert. Opera Honey's acting career began in November 1848 at the Princess's Theatre, London, in the role of Pan in Midas. He was not regarded as a comedian in his early career, but as a singer; he joined the Pyne & Harrison Opera Company and appeared in several operas. One of these was The Rose of Castille, in which he appeared in the original production in 1857 at the Lyceum Theatre, London.The Dramatic List: A record of the performances of living actors and actresses of the British stage, edited by Charles E.

In 1865 he appeared in William Brough's burlesque Prince Amabel; in 1866 he was in Watts Phillips's The Huguenot Captain. In 1867 he appeared at the Prince of Wales Theatre in the original production of Caste by T. W. Robertson, which opened on 6 April; he played the part of Eccles. In the Daily News on 8 April, a critic wrote about this production: > Instead of the conventional clowns who are put in by slop-work dramatists to > lighten the serious interest of their work, we have real characters who > think, speak, and act like human beings, and yet are intensely amusing and > interesting. The drunken father, evidently made up from Mr. George > Cruikshank's pictures of The Bottle, is admirably played by Mr. George > Honey, who made his first appearance at this theatre, and who never acted > better....

Honey was in the original production, which opened on 16 April 1870 at the Vaudeville Theatre, of For Love or Money by Andrew Haliday. He appeared in the play Money by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, playing the part of Graves. He first took this role in 1869; the play was revived at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1872 and 1875, where it made a greater impression on audiences. In the Standard on 31 May 1875, a critic wrote: > A noticeable and welcome feature in the revival is the return of Mr. George > Honey, who resumes his part of Graves, one of the most genuine and > unexaggerated examples of pure humour the modern stage has witnessed.

He was successful in the original cast of W.S.Gilbert's comedy Engaged, which opened on 3 October 1877 at the Haymarket Theatre; he played the part of Cheviot Hill. He returned to the role of Eccles in Caste, from January to May 1879 at the Prince of Wales Theatre. Honey retired due to ill-health in 1879; he died in London in 1880, and was buried in Highgate Cemetery.
