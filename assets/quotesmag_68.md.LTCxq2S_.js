Owned by the Tschudi Group, Sydvaranger owns an open-pit mine at Bj√∏rnevatn and then hauls the ore with the Kirkenes‚ÄìBj√∏rnevatn Line to Kirkenes for processing and shipping. The ore was discovered in 1866, but it was not until the 1900s that new technology made it commercially viable. Sydvaranger was established in 1906 by Christian Anker and Nils Persson and had Sweden's Metallurgiska as the majority owner. Production started in 1910 and capacity was increased in 1913. Production halted during World War I and the company could not recover afterwards, resulting in it falling under bankruptcy protection between 1924 and 1927. During the 1930s the company also owned Rana Mine at Storforshei in Rana. During the German withdrawal in October 1944 Kirkenes was scorched, including most of the mining infrastructure. Reconstruction started in 1945, operation commenced in 1953 and the facilities were completed in 1960. At its peak, the company had 1,500 employees. Production was profitable from the reopening until 1976, but from then the company needed NOK 5 billion in state grants to keep running, before being shut down in 1996. The mining operations restarted in 2009. History=Establishment The iron ore at Bj√∏rnevatn was originally discovered by assistant director of the Geological Survey of Norway, Tellef Dahll, in 1868. It was at the time not commercially viable to mine. With the development of magnetic separation, merchant Christian Anker from Halden started acquiring deeds for the area. In 1903 he contacted the government and started negotiating an agreement to start operations. After several rounds of proposals he received permission and the contract was signed on 9 March 1905. Anker's principal assistant, Engineer Henrik Lund, arrived at Kirkenes in 1903 and started designing the plant. He was assisted by Hans Johan Bernhard Hansen from 1905. They decided that the port should be located at Kirkenes and that a railway would have to be built between the mine and the port.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 60 Workers in 1907 By 1905 then Anker had negotiated an investment agreement with Nils Persson of Sweden, who took over Anker's rights immediately after Anker had signed the contract. The company was established on 12 January 1906 with A. P. Pehrson appointed the company's first managing director. The share capital was set to 5 million Norwegian krone (NOK) and the majority shareholder was Metallurgiska. The first task was to mine a trial 100 tonnes, which were shipped to Lule√• for analysis. Inge Thoresen Wiull was hired as chief engineer in September 1906. He initially started working on housing in Kirkenes, which by 1908 had reached 31 houses for workers, each with four apartments, and six white-collar houses. From November 1906 Wiull was also responsible for constructing the railway and the port, based on his experience from managing the construction of the Valdres Line.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 61 Investments were in 1907 estimated to NOK 12 million, of which NOK 4.3 was for transport investments, NOK 4.5 million for the separation and briquetting plants, and NOK 1.5 million for investments in the mine. Capital was borrowed from a consortium consisting of Norddeutsche Bank, Disconto-Gesellschaft, Centralbanken for Norge and Stockholms Enskilda Bank. In addition the share capital was increased to NOK 10 million at the shareholders meeting in October 1907. A. Herden was hired by Metallurgiska to construct the separation plant and briquetting, which was dimensioned to for an annual export of 600,000 tonnes. This was later reduced to an export capacity of 330,000 tonnes. Pehrson resigned from 1 July 1908 and was replaced by Carl Lundh. To ensure all-year access to the port, the company ordered the 250-kilowatt (350 hp) icebreaker SS Sydvaranger, which was delivered in 1907 and operated by the subsidiary Dampskib Aktieselskabet Pasvik. The subsidiary ordered a second icebreaker, the 450-kilowatt (600 hp) SS Pasvik in 1908.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 62 Kirkenes in 1928 Most of Sydvaranger's original workforce came from Troms and Nordland, most of which were construction workers. Finnmark was experiencing a decline in fishing and some of the workforce came from nearby. The first trade union, Nordens Klippe, was established on 8 September 1906. Gradually separate trade unions for each profession were established. The first strike took place in 1908, but did not last long. Nils Albin Hedman was the first person to be killed in a working accident. The closest hospital was in Vads√∏, but this raised the need for a hospital in Kirkenes. As there already were three public hospitals in Finnmark, the company was required to build a private hospital for its workers‚Äînon-employees had to travel to Vads√∏ or Vard√∏.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 63 Construction of the railway was given high priority to as early as possible aid in transport of workers to the mining sites. Both stations were completed in 1908, the same year as the laying of tracks started. The first steam locomotive, built at Hamar Jernst√∏peri, was delivered during the fall of 1908. For the tacks in the mine, a shunter needed and the company bought a fireless locomotive. Tracks were laid through the open-pit mine, with the length varying. For instance, in 1910 there were of tracks in the mine. Construction of a railway electrification system started in 1910;Aspenberg (2001): 18‚Äì19 because an overhead wire could interfere with the cranes, third- rail conduction was chosen. The electric components were delivered by Siemens- Schukert and were taken into use in 1912. The company took delivery of two electric locomotives. left Vulkan and four German construction companies issued tenders for construction of the separation and briquette plants; as Vulkan offered the second-cheapest bid it was selected. Installations started in July 1909, but work progressed slowly, in part because of the slow progress of the foundation work. This was partially accelerated with workforce from Christiania (Oslo), but they were again hindered because local lumber could not be used for the scaffolding. There was not sand of the necessary quality for concrete in the immediate area, so an aerial tramway was constructed from Bj√∏rnevatn to Sandneselva.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 64 Vulkan also built workshops and installed transformers. The company took delivery of a gyratory crusher in December 1909, which was also installed by Vulkan. The main axle broke during the trials, but it was repaired in time for the opening on 1 October 1910. Sydvaranger initially applied to build a hydroelectric power station in Pasvikelva, but instead had to build a thermal power station in Kirkenes. It was expanded to in 1917. Construction of the port with the separation and briquetting plants, known as the export facilities, started in 1907. Several quays were built, including one for export of ore and one for import of coal.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 65 Pre-war operations The ore-exporting docks in 1928 The first revenue train load was transported on 13 July 1910. The first shipload of ore was 2,000 tonnes sent in October 1910 with SS Bengal. The ship sank with no survivors. The cause was probably that the forty-year-old ship had insufficient bulkheads. The second ship, SS Svend, sank off Valdersund. The third vessel, SS Aguilla, was loaded with 3,100 tonnes, suffered heeling, but was able to return to Kirkenes. Wiull was hired as director of operations in 1910, and the following year Fr. H. Behrens was appointed managing director. Good market conditions resulted in the company deciding in 1911 to increase the facilities capacity to 500,000 tonnes per year, costing NOK 3 million. This involved installing a new crusher, ordering two new locomotives and three new steam shovels and an expansion of the briquette and separation plant. The expansion was completed in 1911.S√∏r- Varanger Historielag (2001): 66 From 1911 the government required the company to establish a fund which would aid the workers should the company go bankrupt. This was introduced after several large industrial companies had collapsed in the past decade and large costs had befallen the state. Just as the first expansion was competed, Sydvaranger decided that it needed to further expand its export capacity to 650,000 tonnes. Financing was secured through issuing new shares worth NOK 3 million. Investments included a new steam shovel, three steam cranes, three locomotives, a new briquetting plant; the work was completed in 1913. In 1913 the company had 1,150 employees. With the break-out of World War I all of Sydvarangers sales and shipping contracts were annulled for the duration of the conflict. In July 1914 the company started securing sufficient spare parts and increasing its purchases of coal and food. As it was difficult to sell ore, the workforce was instead put to preparatory work, such as preparing new areas for mining, emptying one pit of water and lowering the water level in Bj√∏rnevatnet by three meters (10 ft). In addition the company built up a surplus of ore.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 67 Henrik Lund took a study trip to the United States in 1916, where he visited more than twenty cities and brought a series of innovations with him back. Wiull quit in 1917 and was replaced by Johan Knudtzen. left In the aftermath of World War I, Norway was not permitted to export more than 133,624 tonnes of iron ore to Germany per year, of which Sydvaranger was issued a quota of 65,000. None of the Allies were interested in importing from Sydvaranger. The rise of coal prices caused the company to again look into hydroelectricity, and the subsidiary T√•rnelven Kraftselskap was given concession to build a power station in T√•rnelven on 15 July 1919. This was based on moving the flow of Kobbholmvassdraget and Karpelven to T√•rnelven to power a common station, but this proved impossible to accomplish. Instead the lakes of Viksj√∏en, Djupvann and Storvand were regulated and a common power station built at sea level. A long transmission line was built to Bj√∏rnevatn. This allowed the mainline railway between Kirkenes and Bj√∏rnevatn to be electrified in 1920.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 68 By 1919 the company was still not back in production. SS Sydvaranger and several locomotives were sold to raise capital, and the share capital was depreciated by fifty percent to NOK 11.5 million, new shares were sold for this amount and bonds were issued for NOK 10 million. This was not sufficient to save the company's finances, and after negotiations with the creditors, Sydvaranger amortized its shares to NOK 3.45 million and sold new shares worth NOK 21.55 million. The company introduced a new production method using sintering, but returned to briquettes from 1926. The company was struck by a major strike in 1921, which stopped part of the production. By the following year the surplus of export products was down to the pre-war levels and the company had 896 employees. The company also started a policy to lend money to employees to allow them to build their own houses. Sydvaranger entered negotiations with their creditors on 5 August 1925. It was found that the company was well-run, but that the poor results were due to the market conditions. On 13 November the company filed for bankruptcy, but the company was allowed to continue with production using 200 staff. The company was refinanced and left bankruptcy protection on 17 August 1927. At the same time a new agreement with the state was signed, which insured that only Norwegian citizens were permitted to work for the company, and that the mining rights would escheat to the state after 99 years. The new shareholders issued NOK 700,000 for a number of welfare investments in Kirkenes, such as a library and sports facilities. Lundh retired as chairman in 1927. To reduce the conflicts between the company and employees, Sydvaranger started using single-person contracts. These offered higher wages and more welfare advantages, such as paid sick leave, than the collective bargaining agreements, and were used by the company to reduce the trade unions' influence in an attempt to reduce strikes. However, the move resulted in trade unions striking between 12 May 1928 and 13 April 1929, without them succeeding in reducing the output. The conflict resulting in intra-worker conflicts between the strikers and non-unionized.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2001): 69 In 1928 Sydvaranger exported 500,000 tonnes and T√•rnelven Kraftaksjeselskap started construction of a power station in Kobbholmvassdraget. Completed in 1930, it gave an annual production of 7.2 gigawatt-hours. The power company changed its name to Sydvaranger Kraftaksjeselskap in 1934. The company was hit by the Great Depression as ore prices fell in 1930. Production was reduced by reducing the work to a four-day week, which continued for seven months. Although ore prices varied, the company had made a profit throughout the 1930s. Knudtzen retired as chief of operations in 1935 and was replaced by Hans Torgersrud. The following year Sydvaranger bought forty percent of the shipping company Malmfart, which signed a ten-year contract to ship ore. The company's first ship was the 1919 SS Varangmalm. Malmfart later bought SS Varangberg, and both ships were sunk in 1939. Work with establishing mining at Grunntjern and S√∏stervann started in 1937. From 1938 mining started at Kjellmanns√•sen, where there sufficient concentration to allow it to be direct shipping ore. This was the first time trucks were used for transport. The company exported 900,000 tonnes in 1938. From 1939 production was more difficult and was periodically stopped. However, an agreement was signed on 11 July 1939 to establish Harefossen Kraftselskap which would build a power station at Harefossen in Passvikelva. World War II and reconstruction burning of Kirkenes by the Wehrmacht in October 1944 After the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, mining continued under German administration until January 1942. As part of Operation Nordlicht in October 1944, Kirkenes was scorched, causing extensive damage to the mining company's infrastructure. Most of the facilities were bombed, and what was not bombed was burnt or blasted. A notable exception was the two power stations, which the Germans did not have time to scorch. Sydvaranger was hindered from starting its reconstruction until the damages had been priced, which was completed in September 1945.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 60 Sydvaranger's board initially recommended that the company be liquidated, but reversed their opinion after discovering that the war insurance would only be paid if the facilities were reconstructed. This was later set to NOK 27.5 million. Reconstruction started in September 1945 after the Red Army had withdrawn from S√∏r-Varanger. The Directorate for Enemy Property took over ownership which was previously owned by German interests, giving the state a 43.6 percent ownership of Sydvaranger.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 64 By the end of 1945, 390 people were employed in the company. Payments from the war insurance were terminated in October 1946, after payments of NOK 4.3 million, as only companies entirely owned and managed by Norwegian citizens could receive compensation. As an interim solution, the financing was secured through a loan of NOK 10 million from the Ministry of Trade and Industry. Reconstruction of the mine sometime between 1948 and 1955 Guttorm Brukeland was contracted as the main architect for the industrial facilities. From 1945, passenger trains ran between the two settlements, at first with steam locomotives. Reconstruction started with private dwellings and a workshop at Kirkenes, with 73 apartments completed by 1947. Sydvaranger considered changing its mining methods, but new technology resulted in the company continuing with open-pit excavation. Detailed plans for the facilities was issued to the ministry on 16 May 1947. The main change of operations was introduction of pelletizing. A public inquiry of the possibilities was carried out through 1947 and concluded that the company would need NOK 124 million in capital, including NOK 22 million to cover running costs. The company was only able to raise NOK 34.5 million, including the war insurance. The committee proposed that the investments be financed through the state buying new shares for NOK 10 million and issuing NOK 80 million in loans.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 65 Their calculations showed an annual deficit of NOK 3.6 million,S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 66 but the committee regarded it of vital importance for the local community that production be taken up. Sydvaranger's management agreed with the committees analysis of operations, but disagreed regarding the financing. Thus the state and the company started negotiations, including a proposal that the state buy all the private shares of the company. Thus the loans were increased with NOK 11.7 million, while the new share capital was halved. This gave the state a 62.4 percent ownership. By 1948 prices had increased with 100 percent over the 1939, compared to the 18 percent estimated by the committee, which would mean that the plant would run with a profit. Parliament passed the financing on 8 October 1948.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 67 The mining company held an option to purchase a majority stake in Malmfrakt, which they executed to increase their ownership to 96 percent. The shipping company's head office was moved to Kirkenes in 1952. The icebreaker, owned by Dampskipselskapet Pasvik, had been sunk during the war, so a new icebreaker was delivered in 1947, MS Varangis.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 61 All heavy transport during the reconstruction was done using railway, and tracks were laid throughout the mining facility. The contracts to build new facilities was awarded to Trondhjem Cementst√∏beri og Entrepren√∏rforretning. Mining equipment was delivered in 1949 and procured through the Marshall Plan. By 1950 there were 700 employees, in addition to 150 construction workers working for subcontractors. From operations started, transport within the mine was performed using trackless machinery. Production resumed in 1953. The ore- loading facility at Kirkenes in 1957 Malmfrakt signed a cooperation with Fearnley og Eger's Befragtningsforretning regarding a joint venture, named IS Varangskip. This resulted in the 7,880 tonne MS Varangmalm being delivered in 1939 and followed up with the 5,500 tonne SS Varangberg. Two G12 diesel- electric locomotives were delivered from General Motors Electro-Motive Division in 1954 and 1956. In addition, new hooper cars were built by Skabo. In 1956 Sydvaranger exported 1.1 million tonnes of ore which was exported to eight countries, including two Norwegian companies. This gave a revenue of NOK 90.3 million. A new loading facility opened at Bj√∏rnevatn in 1957.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 62 To access new areas of the mine, a tunnel was built from the deepest point of Bj√∏rnevatnet, allowing it to be drained. Construction took four years and was completed in 1957. By 1960 Sydvaranger was the sole owner of Malmfart and issued new share capital of NOK 4.75 million to purchase a new, 7,200-tonne ship, co-owned with Fearnley og Eger's. Both Varangmalm and Varangberg were sold in 1960, after the former had run aground. Torgersrud retired as chief of operations in 1960 and was replaced by Hans Lund Andersen.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (1999): 63 Good times In 1960 the company exported 904,000 tonnes worth NOK 60.8 million and generated a profit of NOK 24.7 million.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 18 By 1962 Malmfart had three vessels, of which two were ore-bulk-oil carrier, which allowed them to transport petroleum on the return voyage to Norway. Up to 1963 the mining had taken place at the √òstmalmen field, but from then production shifted to Vestmalmen. The first IT system, a punch card machine delivered by IBM, was introduced in 1963. A new icebreaker, Varangis II, was delivered the following year, replacing the old icebreaker.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 19 The separate company for operating the icebreakers as liquidated in 1964.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 20 The docks were expanded several times, allowing 17,000-tonne ships from 1959, 27,000-tonne ships from 1963 and 37,000-tonne ships from 1966.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 21 Norway and the Soviet Union came to an agreement in 1957 regarding building hydroelectric power stations along Pasvikelva, which ran along the Norway‚ÄìSoviet Union border. Norway was permitted to build stations at Skoltefoss and Hestefoss, while the Soviet Union was allowed to build at Skoltefoss and Hestefoss, collectively known as the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants. The agreement insured that each country was permitted to use land in the other country to build the dams.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 11 Sydvaranger created the joint venture Sameied Skogfoss Kraftverk along with Varanger Kraftlag til build Skogfoss Power Station. Sydvaranger's half of the investment costs were NOK 44 million. Construction started in 1962 and was completed two years later. The power station had a power output of 240 gigawatt-hours per year, half of which was at the disposal of Sydvaranger. Sydvaranger was free to sell surplus power to the grid. At the same time the mining company sold its power grid in Kirkenes to Varanger Kraftlag. Since 1956 the company had been working on plans to switch to sub-surface shaft mining. By 1964 new technology meant that it would be possible to continue the surface mining to lower levels, although trials with shaft mining received the go-ahead. A trial shaft was completed to by 1965 and to two years later. No sub-surface revenue mining has ever taken place. Eight new 65-tonne ore trucks from Haulpack were delivered in April 1965, along with two dragline excavators and five bores, costing a total of NOK 38 million. The company continued to purchase more and larger trucks, including eighteen 100-tonne trucks from Lectra Haul between 1968 and 1973, and nine 150-tonne trucks. The crusher at Bj√∏rnevatn In 1966 the company decided to build a pelleting plant in Kirkenes, with the first step being demolishing the old storehouses. The change came after a 45-percent drop in the price of slimes. Financing of the investment was made through issuing fifty percent more shares for a value of NOK 11.25 million. The equipment from the pelleting plant was delivered by Krupp and Allis-Chalmers and facility included a silo for 430,000 tonnes of pellets. Trial production started in September 1969 and full-scale production started on 20 April 1970. By 1969 the company had 900 employees and the following year forty percent of the production was pellets. Managing director Kraft Joahnsen retired in 1970 and was replaced by operating director Hans Lund Andersen, who was replaced by Vidar Lindbo.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 23 Because the mining kept moving further into the mine, the crusher moved in 1971. There were many years of little precipitation in the Lake Inari area, causing reduced power production in the Pasvik River. The company therefore decided to reopen the thermal power plant and start importing electricity from the Soviet Union. The same year a roof was built over the pellets facilities, as snow had been hindering optimal operation, and a new dock was opened for exporting the pellets. This allowed 75,000-tonne ships to dock. This caused Malmfart's ships to become too small and the shipping company sold the three vessels between 1970 and 1972. The company did not purchase any new ships, but remained a registered company until 1980.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 22 Facilities in Kirkenes A new workshop at Bj√∏rnevatn was completed in 1973 and the following year a new silo opened at Bj√∏rnevatn, which also allowed for separating out ore with low iron content. Construction of a second pellets facility started in 1972 and was opened on 4 September 1974. This allowed the company's entire production to switch to pellets. Because the two pellets plants used a combined 20,000 tonnes of bentonite each year, a new import dock was built. The pellets production required increased freshwater access. This was fetched from F√∏rstevatn, and to fill that lake, water was pumped from Svartakslavannet. In 1975 the company shifted its IT systems to a terminal which communicated with a data center in Oslo. The company had 1547 employees in 1975.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 24 Lindbo quit in 1976 and was replaced by Ingvald Ohm. He quit the following year and was replaced by Robert Hermansen. Construction of Melkefoss Power Station was started by Sameiet Skogfoss Kraftverk 1976 and completed two years later. Along with Statskog, the municipality and the power company, Sydvaranger established a workshop company at Pasvik. However, this increased transport costs and Sydvaranger would later walk away from the partnership. From the mid-1970s until 1970, Sydvaranger did not produce sufficient slimes themselves and had to import this. Decline and closing Falling ore prices caused the company's first post-war deficit in 1976, of NOK 214.7 million. In wait for better times, production was continued and the pellets stored for later export. The company invested in a HP 3000 minicomputer in 1977 and the following year transferred its public utility services to the municipality. The company transferred its residential real estate to a housing cooperative.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 25 A mining strike in Canada caused increased demand and part of the surplus was sold in 1978. Lay-offs were avoided, but some employees took out early retirement and there was a recruitment stop. From 1981 the company received a NOK 50-million subsidy over the state budget, which increased to the double from the next year. In the mid-1970s, Sydvaranger started planning using natural gas to produce pellets through direct reduction. Originally Karm√∏y was envisioned as a proper site, but it was eventually decided that there would not be built a pipeline there. Korf Stahl took contact with Sydvaranger and proposed a joint venture to establish a facility in Emden, Germany. They established Norddeutsche Ferrowerke (NFW) in 1976, which was owned 74.9 percent by Sydvaranger and 25.1 percent of Korf Stahl. Construction cost 400 million Deutsche Mark (NOK 1100 million) and had an annual production of 1.2 million tonnes. Financing was in part secured through state guarantees, loans from German banks and a DM 45 million loan from the European Coal and Steel Community. Natural gas was delivered from Norway via Norpipe. Construction started on 17 July 1978 and was taken into use in the second half of 1980. Rising natural gas prices and interest rates combined with sinking ore prices made the plant a financial disaster. The Norwegian government agreed in April 1981 to subsidize operations, which kept the plant going until July 1982, when it filed for bankruptcy. Sydvaranger had guaranteed for NOK 45 million of the loans; this and the bill for the natural gas was covered by the state. Open-pit mines at Bj√∏rnevatn The head office was moved from Oslo to Kirkenes in 1982 and Ottar Brekke was hired as managing director from 18 February. He was replaced by Knut H. H√ºbert two years later. Faults with the exporting facilities caused the silos to fill in late 1982; by January 1983, 800 employees had been laid off. Work on removing gangue started at Bj√∏rnefjell the following year, and mining of the ore there was completed within two years. In 1985 the majority of the board supported gangue removal at √òstmalmen, but was met with a dissent of the minority. While the operations were necessary for long-term operations at the mine, it would require state subsidies. State Secretary Kjell Hansen was opposed to the proposal and on 30 April 1985 Parliament cut the subsidies, hindering additional gangue breaking. This caused H√ºbert to resign and he was replaced by Oddmund Husum. Parliament's decision caused a strike and all production was halted on 2 May. It was found illegal by the Industrial Disputes Court on 14 May, but continued until 5 June.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 26 A used T45 locomotive was delivered in 1984. Mining took place at Jerntoppen from 1986 to 1993 and at √òstmalmen from 1989 to 1996. The older pellets plant was closed in 1986. There were proposals to start a coke plant, but these were abandoned and the plant demolished in 1988.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 28 Between 1986 and 1990, Sydvaranger halved its output of ore and reduced its workforce from 900 to 600. To help create new jobs, Sydvaranger joined with Valmet to create Kirkenes Mekaniske Verksted. The new company was largely established with state grants and the entirety of Sydvaranger's electrical division was transferred. Sydvaranger shifted part of its production to \\"Superslimes\\" with magnetite concentration of between 95 and 98 percent. Production reached 68,000 tonnes in 1990.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 27 Husaas retired in 1989 and was replaced by √òystein Berntsen. A new MaK G 1203 BB locomotive was delivered in 1990, as the T45 had proved no more reliable than the G12s. Construction of a ferrite plant started in 1991, but was delayed several times, including changing the technology and replacing the new oven which cracked. It was completed by 1994 and cost NOK 43.6 million. The company also started pigment production from October 1995.S√∏r-Varanger Historielag (2005): 29 Map of the Kirkenes‚ÄìBj√∏rnevatn Line Sydvaranger was restructured in 1992, with the company focusing on four production divisions: ore production, Sydvaranger Service, trade with Russia, and shipping. They were act as a purchaser of services within the company, and the other divisions were designated as selling divisions, such as maintenance and service. The production division was free to purchase internally or externally, and the selling divisions were free to sell their services outside the company. At the same time a forum was established with between 15 and 20 employees to create new companies which could utilize the workforce. Only a single project materialized from this. The real estate division was sold to A/S Anlegg in 1994, and the following year the workshops were sold to Steinsvik Maskinindustri. The latter went bankrupt in 2004. By 1994 Sydvaranger had 140 employees, and by 1995 it had 25. Ragnar √òstby was hired as new managing director from 1995. The company also changed its legal name from A/S Sydvaranger to Sydvaranger ASA, a consequence of a legal change and stating it was a public company. The Council of State decided on 10 May 1996 that operations in Sydvaranger were to be terminated within the end of the year. To redevelop the facilities, Kirkenes Utviking was established, which was owned by the municipality, Finnmark County Municipality, the Industrial Development Corporation of Norway and the Industrial and Regional Development Fund. Most of the movable mining equipment was sold at an auction in August 1997.S√∏r- Varanger Historielag (2005): 31 Between 1976 and 1996, the Government of Norway subsidized Sydvaranger with about NOK 5 billion, and owned 88 percent of the company at the time of the mines shutting down. From the closing to 1999, the company paid out more than NOK 100 million in dividend to the shareholders and was the company during that period to have the second-highest increase in share value increase on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Negotiations were started with Australian Bulk Minerals (ABM) for a leasing of the mine, the railway and other facilities. An agreement was signed in 1997, with the takeover date set to 31 December 1998. ABM had not secured financing by then, and new negotiations started in 1999, but the deal was laid dead in 2000. Sydvaranger also started negotiating a sale of their share of Pasvik Kraft, and originally planned to sell to Vattenfall and √òstfold Energi, but this was stopped by Varanger Kraft. Instead, Varanger Kraft bought the state's ownership in Sydvaranger and other shares, and used their pre-emption right to secure a 100-percent ownership of the company. Sydvaranger was delisted from Oslo Stock Exchange on 12 September 2000. That year the company had five employees and started work on transforming into an investment company with focus on eastern Finnmark. Reopening At the time of the closure of the mine, the Government of Norway owned 87% of the company. In December 1999 it sold its ownership to Varanger Kraft (who owned 63%) and the S√∏r-Varanger Municipality (37%). In 1999 Arctic Bulk Minerals bought the production equipment and wanted to attempt new mining activities in the mine, but the attempt failed and the assets were returned to Sydvaranger to pay for the debt. In 2006 the company was sold to Northern Iron Ltd, that reopened the mine in 2009. External investors invested 2,400 million Norwegian krone (NOK) for the costs of this. In 2015 the mining company went bankrupt as a result of low iron ore prices. In April 2016 the mine and its equipment was sold for 78 million krone to the Tschudi Group. In 2016, a successful test production took place, proving the plant's operational readiness. As the main mining license was connected to the bankrupt company, an application for a new mining license was submitted in 2017. Significant geological and engineering work was completed in 2017. In 2018, Sydvaranger obtained financing for a restart from the American private equity fund Orion Mine Finance, which is one of the biggest dedicated mining funds in the world. In 2019, the final mining permit was obtained from the Norwegian government, allowing for a planned restart of full-scale operations in 2020.

The film is written by Aseem Arora. Although initially set to be released on 6 June 2008, it was pushed to 24 October 2008, the opening weekend of the holiday Diwali. On 22 November 2008 the script of Heroes was asked to be part of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Plot Two film academy students, Ali (Vatsal Sheth) and Sameer (Sohail Khan), must make a movie in order to graduate. They choose to create a documentary illustrating reasons not to join the Indian Armed Forces, and go on a motorcycle road trip bearing three letters they have been given to deliver -- each from a slain soldier to his family. On their first stop, in Atari, Amritsar, they meet the widow, Kuljeet Kaur (Preity Zinta), and the son, Jasswinder Singh [Jassi] (Dwij Yadav), of a Sikh soldier, Balkar Singh (Salman Khan), who was killed in action three years earlier. The students find that the entire village is very proud of the heroic officer and his sacrifice for the country. When they are flying kites, their kite is cut and it falls beyond a certain fence, in another field. Jassi tells them that the area beyond the fence is Pakistan, and the fence is the Border. The students' second stop, Himachal, finds them meeting the Air Force pilot Vikram Shergill (Sunny Deol), who uses a wheelchair and whose Army officer brother, Dhananjay Shergill (Bobby Deol), had also been killed in action. Vikram is very proud of his brother's sacrifice. and he shows them how he has come to terms with his own grief. The third letter is to be delivered to a Mr. and Mrs. Naqvi (played by Mithun Chakraborty and Prateeksha Lonkar), but their bike runs out of petrol, and they hitch a ride on a military convoy heading to a nearby base. They see soldiers' coffins in the truck, and the driver quotes an inspiring poem. At the base, they talk to the regiment commander and find another letter by Lt. Sahil Naqvi (Dino Morea) which they request to deliver themselves. They see that Mrs. Naqvi is busy in a tea party, hardly paying any attention. Sameer accuses her of not loving her son, and says that Sahil was a coward. Mrs. Naqvi plays them a tape which Sahil had recorded after he had saved another soldier's life. She tells him that she and her husband have been affected, and the parties serve as a distraction for them. They leave, but return the next day, and slowly bring the couple's life back to normal. After completing their film, they reveal in a voice over that although they graduated, they did not go to America (as they had initially planned) because the trip has changed their outlook. They try to join the Army but fail, then start a school to share their experiences. Some years later, Sameer and Ali are walking around their School campus. A man in olive green uniform (Salman Khan) approaches them. This is revealed to be Jassi, the son of the first martyred army officer. Now a strapping young man, he has joined the army like his father, and will soon graduate from the IMA. The movie ends with the statement, \\"You don't have to be a soldier to love your country\\".  Production  Originally titled Mera Bharat Mahaan (My India is Great), the film was rechristened Heroes, to avoid sounding jingoistic. Filming began on 15 June 2007. Salman and Preity are paired opposite each other, in their fifth film together. Shooting took place in Ladakh, Chandigarh, Punjab and Delhi. Some scenes were shot in Pangong Tso featuring Salman Khan, Sohail Khan and Vatsal Sheth. Cast *Mithun Chakraborty as Dr Maqbool Naqvi *Sunny Deol as Sqn.Ldr.

Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the movie 3.5 stars out of 5. According to The Indian Express the film does manage to say what it set out to; that pride keeps the families of the deceased soldiers going, civilians sleep peacefully only because soldiers give up their lives, and that a country survives only because it has brave soldiers guarding its borders. But it argues the director is too simplistic and that wringing emotion out of so many situations causes even the supreme sacrifice that the soldiers make turn trite. India Times movies give the movie 3 out of 5. The film's writer Aseem Arora was nominated for a Filmfare Award for Best Story. Box office Ths film grossed $326,425 in its opening week. It was an above-average performer at box office.

History The Liberal Party was founded in 1846 and as such was the first political party of Belgium. Walth√®re Fr√®re- Orban wrote the first charter for the new party. The Liberal Party had a clear victory in the 1848 elections, following lower tax requirements that benefited urban populations, where liberals were stronger. The Liberal Party remained in dominant position for the most part of the period from 1848 until 1884, where it lost to Catholics due to the First School War. The Liberal Party suffered even more losses in the next elections, most notable in the 1894 elections, the first ones with universal suffrage. However, they made a comeback in 1900 upon the introduction of proportional representation. From 1887 until 1900, the Progressive Party (French: Parti Progressiste, Dutch: Progressieve Partij) existed as a separate progressive Liberal party.

He was a general in the Polish Army and Minister of Defense of Poland from 1983 to 1990. Military and political career Son of El≈ºbieta and Eugeniusz. His father was a non- commissioned officer. In 1930, Eugeniusz Siwicki was transferred to the reserve and moved with his family to village near Rivne. At first, he was the owner of a small, three-hectare farm, and later he was employed as a bookkeeper in the commune office. In April 1940, his father was arrested by NKVD officers. A month later, Florian and his mother were deported deep into the Soviet Union to the Arkhangelsk region. At the age of 17 he was forced to join the Red Army.

Siwicki was appointed to the position of Minister of Defense after Jaruzelski stepped down from that post; he also functioned as Jaruzelski's \\"top deputy on the defense council\\". In October 1983, Siwicki was awarded with the Order of the Cross of Grunwald, first class, one of his many decorations. As agreed in the Round Table talks and during subsequent political developments, Siwicki remained the Minister of Defense in Solidarity-led government of Mazowiecki until July 1990.

Conspiracy Game Plot summary Jack Norton, one of a group of Navy SEALs that were psychically and physically enhanced by Dr. Peter Whitney, called Ghostwalkers, is on a mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to rescue his twin brother, Ken from rebel forces. Ken had led a team sent to save an American senator whose plane had gone down. Unfortunately, Ken himself was then captured and tortured before he was retrieved. When he rescued his brother, Jack too was captured; however he was able to escape. Briony Jenkins takes a walk in the jungle, despite the danger of encountering rebel forces. She is a member of a circus family, called the Flying Five. But she has always been different; she cannot be around people without feeling constant pain. She is also stronger and faster than either of her four brothers. Jack encounters Briony while hiding in the jungle, and is immediately aware that she is a Ghostwalker like himself. He is also stunned by his powerful attraction to her. Briony in turn is amazed that even with his numerous injuries, she cannot feel his pain nor hear his thoughts; it's the first time that has ever happened. She is also surprised to learn that Jack knows her older brother Jebediah, having served with him when Jeb was a SEAL. Briony is able to get Jack to her hotel and treat his wounds. The next day, Jeb arrives and is at first stunned then alarmed to see Jack with his sister. Jack has always had a formidable reputation, and he's surprised that his sister seems comfortable in his presence. Jeb agrees to help Jack, and suggest he hides in the arena where they have been permitted to practice. Throughout the next few days as Jack waits to be picked up by his people, the attraction and intimacy between him and Briony grows. When it is time to leave, Jack coolly informs her that he doesn't want to continue their relationship. Almost three months later, Briony discovers that she's pregnant. Before she can get over that shock, her doctor tries to drug her and kidnap her. She and her brother escape and go on the run. Twice more enhanced soldiers find her and try to ‚Äúreturn her to the lab‚Äù. Then a man calling himself Kaden Montague appears and shows her a file of her life. The story told to her adoptive family is a lie; she is not the daughter of a man whose wife died in childbirth. She is one of several orphaned girls who have been psychically and physically enhanced by a man named Peter Whitney. She was given to her family because he wanted to see if she was tough enough to survive the constant bombardment of human emotion without an anchor (a psychic who can filter strong emotion). Not only that, but the overwhelming attraction between Jack and Briony is no accident. Whitney designed pheromones that would insure strong physical compatibility. All he needed to do was get them both at the same place at the time and nature would take care of the rest. All of this was done so that Briony and Jack would be the parents of the second generation of Whitney's supersoldiers. Briony knows that she can't remain with her family; as her pregnancy advances, she'll be less able to defend herself. So she turns to the one person who might be able to protect her and her unborn child, Jack Norton. When Briony and Jeb appear on the doorstep of Jack and his twin brother's remote cabin, he is stunned by her revelation that she's pregnant. He's even more surprised by the information that not only is Whitney still alive, but he's also plotting to kidnap Briony. Somewhat to even Briony's surprise, he agrees to protect her and the baby. It's not all good news however; the attraction manufactured by Whitney is as intense as ever; if anything, it's even stronger than before. As they spend time together, Briony realizes that Jack is not the ‚Äúbadass‚Äù he purports to be, but a man shattered by an abusive and painful childhood. His own father killed his mother and tried to kill him and his brother because of his intense jealousy. Jack has always feared that he too would be like that if he were ever to fall in love. Just as Jack and Briony reach this new understanding, the house comes under attack. Whitney's men have found her again. Briony realizes that the only way they could be tailing her is with a tracking devise. She finds and removes it. She also makes another revelation; she remembers that she has a sister, a twin sister. A fact that Luther, one of the men sent to reacquire her confirms. Luckily, Jack and Ken are able to fight off the soldiers until they can be rescued by their comrades. Both Jack and Ken pledge to help find Briony find her sister, Mari.

The Firth of Forth was the border between the Picto- Gaelic Kingdom of Alba and the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria in the early 10th century. It became the first Anglo-Scottish border with the annexation of Northumbria by Anglo-Saxon England in the mid 10th century. In 973, Kenneth, King of Scots attended the English king, Edgar the Peaceful, at his council in Chester. After Kenneth had reportedly done homage, Edgar rewarded Kenneth by granting him Lothian. Despite this transaction, the control of Lothian was not finally settled and the region was taken by the Scots at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and the River Tweed became the de facto Anglo-Scottish border. The Solway‚ÄìTweed line was legally established in 1237 by the Treaty of York between England and Scotland. It remains the border today, with the exception of the Debatable Lands, north of Carlisle, and a small area around Berwick- upon-Tweed, which was taken by England in 1482. Berwick was not fully annexed into England until 1746, by the Wales and Berwick Act 1746. For centuries until the Union of the Crowns the region on either side of the boundary was a lawless territory suffering from the repeated raids in each direction of the Border Reivers. Following the Treaty of Union 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united Scotland with England and Wales to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Border forms the boundary of the two legal systems as the treaty between Scotland and England guaranteed the continued separation of English law and Scots law. The age of marriage under Scots law is 16, while it is 18 under English law. The border settlements of Gretna Green to the west, and Coldstream and Lamberton to the east, were convenient for elopers from England who wanted to marry under Scottish laws, and marry without publicity. The marine boundary was adjusted by the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 so that the boundary within the territorial waters (up to the limit) is north of the boundary for oil installations established by the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987.Scottish Parliament Official Report 26 April 2000. Retrieved 19 May 2012.  History  The border country, historically known as the Scottish Marches, is the area either side of the Anglo-Scottish border including parts of the modern council areas of Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders, and parts of the English counties of Cumbria and Northumberland. It is a hilly area, with the Scottish Southern Uplands to the north, and the Cheviot Hills forming the border between the two countries to the south. From the Norman conquest of England until the reign of James VI of Scotland, who in the course of his reign became James I of England while retaining the more northerly realm, border clashes were common and the monarchs of both countries relied on Scottish Earls of March and Lord Warden of the Marches to defend and control the frontier region. Second War of Scottish Independence Territory ceded to England by the 1334 Treaty of Newcastle. In 1333, during the Second War of Scottish Independence, Scotland was defeated at the Battle of Halidon Hill and Edward III occupied much of the borderlands. Edward declared Edward Balliol the new King of Scots, in exchange for the much of southern Scotland and absolute supplication. By 1341, Perth and Edinburgh had been retaken by the Scots and Edward Balliol recalled to England, effectively nullifying the treaty. Edward would again crush the War in 1346 and for good with the Treaty of Berwick (1357), but no more territory concessions were demanded, only money.  Clans  A 16th-century Act of the Scottish Parliament talks about the chiefs of the border clans, and a late 17th-century statement by the Lord Advocate uses the terms \\"clan\\" and \\"family\\" interchangeably. Although Lowland aristocrats may have increasingly liked to refer to themselves as \\"families\\", the idea that the term \\"clan\\" should be used of Highland families alone is a 19th-century convention. Historic Border clans include the following: Armstrong, Beattie, Bannatyne, Bell, Briar, Douglas, Elliot, Graham, Hedley of Redesdale, Henderson, Home or Hume, Irvine, Jardine, Johnstone, Kerr, Little, Moffat, Nesbitt, Ogilvy, Porteous, Routledge, Scott, Thompson Tweedie.  Scottish Marches  During late medieval and early modern eras‚Äîfrom the late 13th century, with the creation by Edward I of England of the first Lord Warden of the Marches to the early 17th century and the creation of the Middle Shires, promulgated after the personal union of England and Scotland under James VI of Scotland (James I of England)‚Äîthe area around the border was known as the Scottish Marches. For centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.  Middle Shires  Following the 1603 Union of the Crowns, King James VI & I decreed that the Borders should be renamed 'the Middle Shires'. In the same year the King placed George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar in charge of pacification of the borders. Courts were set up in the towns of the Middle Shires and known reivers were arrested. The more troublesome and lower classes were executed without trial; known as \\"Jeddart justice\\" (after the town of Jedburgh in Roxburghshire). Mass hanging soon became a common occurrence. In 1605 he established a joint commission of ten members, drawn equally from Scotland and England, to bring law and order to the region. This was aided by statutes in 1606 and 1609, first to repeal hostile laws on both sides of the border, and then to more easily prosecute cross-border raiders.See: Border Reivers#Legislation Reivers could no longer escape justice by crossing from England to Scotland or vice versa.Act anent fugitive persones of the borders to the in countrey (1609): Forsamekle as the kingis majestie is resolved to purge the mydele schyres of this isle, heirtofoir callit the bordouris of Scotland and England, of that barbarous crueltie, wickednes and incivilitie whilk be inveterat custome almaist wes become naturall to mony of the inhabitantis thairof... (Translated: Forasmuch as the king's majesty is resolved to purge the middle shires of this isle, heretofore called the borders of Scotland and England, of that barbarous cruelty, wickedness and incivility which by inveterate custom almost was become natural to many of the inhabitants thereof...) The rough-and-ready Border Laws were abolished and the folk of the middle shires found they had to obey the law of the land like all other subjects. In 1607 James felt he could boast that \\"the Middle Shires\\" had \\"become the navel or umbilic of both kingdoms, planted and peopled with civility and riches\\". After ten years King James had succeeded; the Middle Shires had been brought under central law and order. By the early 1620s the Borders were so peaceful that the Crown was able to scale down its operations. Despite these improvements, the Joint Commission continued its work, and as late as 25 September 1641 under King Charles I, Sir Richard Graham, a local laird and English MP, was petitioning the Parliament of Scotland \\"for regulating the disorders in the borders\\".Petition of Sir Richard Graham regarding the middle shires: I am desired by Sir Richard Graham to move your majesty and this house of parliament that some present course may be taken for regulating the disorders that are now in the middle shires, this being the best time whilst the English commissioners are here that order may be given to the commissioners of both kingdoms to call the border landlords now in town to inform themselves what course has been formerly held for the suppressing of disorder and apprehending of felons and fugitives. Conditions along the border generally deteriorated during the Commonwealth and Protectorate periods, with the development of Moss-trooper raiders. Following the Restoration, on-going border lawlessness was dealt with by reviving former legislation, renewed continually in eleven subsequent acts, for periods ranging from five to eleven years, up until the late 1750s. Controversial territories=The Debatable Lands Scots' Dike The Debatable Lands lay between Scotland and England to the north of Carlisle, the largest population centre being Canonbie. For over three hundred years the area was effectively controlled by local clans, such as the Armstrongs, who successfully resisted any attempt by the Scottish or English governments to impose their authority.The History of Liddesdale, Eskdale, Ewesdale, Wauchopedale and the ..., Volume 1 By Robert Bruce Armstrong pp. 181‚Äì2 In 1552 commissioners met to divide the land in two: Douglas of Drumlanrigg leading the Scots; Lord Wharton leading the English; the French ambassador acting umpire. The Scots' Dike was built as the new frontier, with stones set up bearing the arms of England and of Scotland. Berwick-upon-Tweed Berwick is famous for its hesitation over whether it is part of Scotland or England.New Statesman. 11 Sep 2014. The Scottish referendum means Berwick-upon-Tweed faces an uncertain future. Retrieved 2 December 2018. Berwickshire is in Scotland while the town is in England, although both Berwick and the lands up to the Firth of Forth belonged to the Kingdom of Northumbria in the Early Middle Ages. The town changed hands more than a dozen times before being finally taken by the English in 1482, though confusion continued for centuries. The Wales and Berwick Act 1746 clarified the status of Berwick as an English town. In the 1950s the artist Wendy Wood moved the border signs south to the middle of the River Tweed as a protest. In 2008 SNP MSP Christine Grahame made calls in the Scottish Parliament for Berwick to become part of Scotland again. Berwick's MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan has resisted any change, arguing that: \\"Voters in Berwick-upon-Tweed do not believe it is whether they are in England or Scotland that is important.\\"  The Ba Green  At the River Tweed the border runs down the middle of the river, however between the villages of Wark and Cornhill the Scottish border comes south of the river to enclose a small riverside meadow of approximately 2 to 3 acres (about a hectare). This piece of land is known as the Ba Green. It is said locally that every year the men of Coldstream (to the North of the river) would play the men of Wark (to the South of the river) at ba, and the winning side would claim the Ba Green for their country. As Coldstream grew to have a larger population than Wark, the Coldstream men always defeated the Wark men at the game, and so the land became a permanent part of Scotland. Hadrian's Wall misconception Hadrian's Wall near Greenhead. The Wall has never formed the actual Anglo-Scottish border. It is a common misconception that Hadrian's Wall marks the Anglo-Scottish border. The wall lies entirely within England and has never formed this boundary.English Heritage. 30 Surprising Facts About Hadrian's Wall Retrieved 18 March 2017.Financial Times. Borders held dear to English and Scots Retrieved 18 March 2017. While it is less than south of the border with Scotland in the west at Bowness-on-Solway, in the east it is as much as away. For centuries the wall was the boundary between the Roman province of Britannia (to the south) and the Celtic lands of Caledonia (to the north). However Britannia occasionally extended as far north as the later Antonine Wall. Furthermore, to speak of England and Scotland at any time prior to ninth century is anachronistic; such nations had no meaningful existence during the period of Roman rule. \\"Hadrian's Wall\\" is nonetheless often used as an informal reference to the modern border, often semi-humorously. Migration Cumbria and Northumberland have amongst the largest Scottish-born communities in the world outside Scotland. 16,628 Scottish born people were residing in Cumbria in 2001 (3.41% of the county's population) and 11,435 Scottish born people were residing in Northumberland (3.72% of the county's population); the overall percentage of Scottish-born people in England is 1.62%.

He formed a striker duo with Danish international Mark Strudal, and Hansen was called up for the Danish national team in January 1995. He was a part of the Danish squad for the 1995 King Fahd Cup, and played a single game as Denmark won the tournament, when he replaced Mark Strudal at halftime during the 2‚Äì0 victory against Saudi Arabia. This was to be his only national team game. Hansen was Br√∏ndby's second best goalscorer of the 1994‚Äì95 Superliga season, scoring one goal fewer than Strudal. For the 1995‚Äì96 Superliga season, contention for the striker positions in the Br√∏ndby starting line-up was intensified. Danish international Peter M√∏ller arrived from Aalborg BK, and later Danish national team captain Ebbe Sand also emerged as a goalscorer.

He also appears in the 1996 film adaption of Trainspotting and its sequel T2 Trainspotting (2017), in both of which he is portrayed by Ewan McGregor. Character biography=NovelsTrainspotting (1993)= In the late 1980s, Mark Renton is an unemployed heroin addict living in the Leith district of Edinburgh. He attempts to get off heroin, but finds it too difficult and resorts to buying opium suppositories from untrustworthy dealer Mikey Forrester. Later, at a party with his friends Simon \\"Sick Boy\\" Williamson, Francis Begbie, Danny \\"Spud\\" Murphy, Stevie and Tommy, Dawn, the infant daughter of Simon and a woman named Lesley, dies in her crib, greatly upsetting Sick Boy and inspiring him to get clean from heroin. After witnessing Dawn's death, Renton resumes heroin use. After continuing to collect unemployment pay, Renton later meets with Tommy, who is now depressed due to being dumped by his girlfriend. He asks Renton to supply him with heroin to make him feel better. Spud and Renton are arrested while stealing. Danny is sent to prison, but Renton avoids jail time due to attending rehab. He hints that the underlying cause of his addiction was from the death of his catatonic brother Davie. Soon after, Renton's other brother Billy is killed by a bombing attack by the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Renton relapses into heroin once more and moves to London, where he has an encounter with a homosexual Italian man named Gi. He later goes back to Edinburgh for the funeral of Matty, a fellow addict. After witnessing so much death related to heroin, he decides to get clean again while in London, but returns back to Edinburgh again to visit his former dealer Johnny Swan, who recently had his leg amputated from heroin abuse, and Tommy, who is dying of AIDS. He meets once again with Spud, Begbie and Sick Boy, as well as another friend \\"Second Prize\\", and the five sell a large amount of heroin to a dealer for ¬£16,000. After celebrating in a pub, Renton decides to steal the money from his friends and walk away to a new life, leaving a small share for Spud. =Porno (2002)= Several years later, Renton is a now nightclub owner in Amsterdam and has not used heroin in years. One night, Renton sees Carl Ewart, a DJ from Edinburgh (a character from Welsh's novel Glue), who recognises him. Later, Sick Boy learns from some of Carl's friends that Renton now lives in Amsterdam, and the two agree to meet in Zurich, but Renton instead flees to San Francisco. Renton visits his hometown of Leith one more time, but he is seen by Begbie, who is still bitter over Renton stealing their money years earlier. He runs across the road in an attempt to attack Renton, but Begbie is hit by a car. Renton takes Begbie to hospital and flees Edinburgh for the last time with ¬£60,000 which he stole from Sick Boy, and two of his friends Nikki and Diane. Sick Boy visits Begbie in the hospital as the two plot to find and kill Renton and take back their stolen money. FilmsTrainspotting (1996)= The film follows much of the plot laid out by the novel, with some changes. In the film, Mark Renton is a 26-year-old, unemployed man who lives with his parents in Edinburgh, engaging in heroin use with Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and their dealer Swanney \\"Mother Superior\\" (Peter Mullan). Begbie (Robert Carlyle) and Tommy (Kevin McKidd) urge Renton to cease heroin use and get clean, which Renton unsuccessfully tries to do with the use of opium suppositories. One night at a club, he meets a girl called Diane (Kelly Macdonald), who he later has sex with at her house. He learns the next morning that she is below the age of consent. She threatens to report him to the police if he does not continue the relationship. Tommy begins using heroin after being dumped by girlfriend, and Renton begins to relapse into heroin use after the death of Dawn. Renton, Spud and Sick Boy are caught shoplifting and Renton is sent to rehab while Spud is sent to prison and Sick Boy narrowly escapes. He becomes depressed due to having no meaning to his life and quickly relapses, but nearly dies from an overdose in Swanney's home. He withdraws from heroin cold turkey and later visits Tommy, who has been infected with AIDS. He later moves to London on Diane's advice and gets a job as real estate agent. Soon after, he is tracked down by Begbie, who is a fugitive back home after stealing from a jewellery store, and Sick Boy, now a pimp and drug dealer. They return home to attend the funeral of Tommy, who has died of toxoplasmosis. They reunite with the recently released Spud, and the four buy ¬£4,000 worth of heroin from Mikey Forrester, which they resell to a high-level dealer in London for ¬£16,000. They celebrate at a pub, but Renton feels alienated from his friends after Sick Boy indicates that he would steal the money and Begbie needlessly assaults an innocent man after his suit is stained by beer. Renton asks the meek Spud if he would be willing to steal the money for themselves, but Spud fears the consequences. While getting some rest at a hotel room, Renton decides to take the money and leave. He leaves ¬£4,000 in a safety deposit box for Spud to collect. Begbie violently destroys the hotel room after learning Renton has betrayed them, which gets him arrested by the police. Meanwhile, Renton walks away to his new life. =T2 Trainspotting (2017)= 20 years later, Renton is now 46 and lives in Amsterdam with his wife. On the verge of divorce and a mid-life crisis, he returns to a nostalgic trip to Edinburgh. He visits Spud and saves him from a suicide attempt. Spud tells him where to find Sick Boy and sees him at his pub. Sick Boy angrily attacks Renton, still vengeful for the betrayal. He gives ¬£4,000 to Sick Boy, but Sick Boy angrily rants to his girlfriend Veronkia that he is not satisfied and will string Renton along in an elaborate plan to gain his revenge. Meanwhile, Begbie escapes prison. Renton and Sick Boy begin development of a brothel in the upper floor of Sick Boy's pub, and Renton begins an affair with Veronika. Spud also joins in on the scheme. Although, Sick Boy is initially still mad at Renton for stealing the money, they later bond and resume their friendship. Renton later encounters Begbie at a club, and narrowly survives a stabbing attempt from Begbie. The plot thickens as Begbie visits Spud and Veronika, stealing Veronika's phone and telling Renton and Sick Boy to come to the pub. Spud arrives too late to tell the duo of Begbie's plan, and Sick Boy is knocked out by Begbie after protesting. Renton and Begbie struggle on the top floor of the pub, which leaves Renton hanging by his neck from electrical wiring. Begbie tries to strangle Renton, but he is knocked out by Spud with a toilet bowl. They leave Begbie outside a prison. Renton and Sick Boy resume their friendship, while Veronika returns back to Bulgaria and Spud reconciles with his family. Renton returns to his father's home and they embrace, with Renton going back to his childhood bedroom and dancing to remix of \\"Lust for Life\\". Development Film producer Andrew Macdonald read Trainspotting on a plane in December 1993 and thought it would make a good basis for a film. Ewan McGregor was cast as Renton, while Ewen Bremner, who played Renton in the novel's stage adaption, was cast as Spud. In preparation for the role, McGregor lost 2 stone (12.7 kilograms) and shaved his head. He also learned how to cook up heroin in order to better understand the character. Reception McGregor's performance as Renton was well received, and it launched his career into much bigger roles. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, \\"in McGregor ... the film has an actor whose magnetism monopolizes our attention no matter what\\". Screenonline praised Renton's \\"sarcastic narration\\" and noted the film's message of \\"choosing life\\".http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/1011822/index.html McGregor's sardonic performance was similarly praised by Vice,https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/ev7gpj/trainspotting-mark-renton-ewan- mcgregor-crush and McGregor won several awards for his portrayal.

In rare circumstances, Tepoxalin can also be used in human pharmacology to relieve pain caused by musculoskeletal conditions such as arthritis and hip dysplasia. In 1997, the drug was patented for veterinary use, replacing isoxazole for treating inflammation. In 2017, the drug was withdrawn from the American market and can no longer be administered in the United States. Tepoxalin (C20H20ClN3O3) is produced by the condensation of a carboxyl group and an amino group. There are many perspectives on whether the consumption of Tepoxalin on its own is more effective than combining it with other antihistamines, but when applied in veterinary medicine, Tepoxalin is regularly synthesised with other antihistamines.  Approval  The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) approves Tepoxalin to be used as a drug for animals to reduce inflammation and pain control. Additionally, in Europe, Tepoxalin is approved by the EU Community Register of Medicinal Products and European Medicines Agency in the product categories of Veterinary Drug and Veterinary Pharmacotherapeutic Group categorised into the Musculo-skeletal System subcategory. Tepoxalin was first medically approved in the United States in 1998. The drug was taken off the market in 2017 and cannot be administered in the United States. However, it still has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. On the 4 September 2017, an application was submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) asking for an extension of marketing authorisation for Tepoxalin. The EMEA criticised the quality, safety and efficacy data submitted and the application was declined.  Pharmacology and biochemistry  Tepoxalin (C20H20ClN3O3) is produced by the condensation of a carboxyl group of 3-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrazol-3-yl] propanoic acid and an amino group of N-methylhydroxylamine. Condensation is a chemical reaction in which two or more molecules merge into form a larger molecule, with the simultaneous loss of a small molecule such as water or methanol. The drug works as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to suppress both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. Cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase produces COX-2 and 5-LOX enzymes respectively, these enzymes activate the swelling and inflammation that causes pain in animals. Tepoxalin is an inhibitor which blocks out theses enzymes to reduce the swelling and inflammation. Additionally, it can be also used as a ‚Äúdual-action‚Äù inhibitor to additionally suppress leukotriene and prostaglandin (E2).Leukotriene and prostaglandin are also enzymes that activates inflammation in the body. Tepoxalin is produced into white, flavourless tablets that rapidly disintegrate when consumed by an animal. These tasteless tablets are branded as Zubrin on the market. After consumption, Zubrin has a half-life of 120 minutes in the plasma (cytoplasm; the main part of the capsule) itself, whereas the entire metabolite (entirety of the capsule) has a half-life of 13 hours. It is therefore usually prescribed to be taken once a day.  Canine and feline uses  Available in an oral formulation, Tepoxalin is used to treat osteoarthritis in canine and feline species. The use of Tepoxalin was more effective than the NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-flammatory drug), carprofen when administered in canines. As a result, the usage of carprofen was replaced with Tepoxalin in 1998. Tepoxalin can only be administered to dogs that weigh 3 pounds (~1.36kgs) or larger at a dose of 10‚Äì20 mg/kg at a daily schedule. The approximate duration of complete treatment is at most 14 days. If treated for a prolonged period of time (more than 180 days), it may result in gastrointestinal irritation and gastric ulceration. The plasma concentration of Tepoxalin when administered varies between every dog, so there is no difference in administering between fed or fasted canines. However, there is a low water solubility and a high fat solubility, it is often prescribed to fed canines rather than fasted as this is more effective for Tepoxalin. In felines, Tepoxalin has an inhibitory action on COX-1 and 5-LOX enzymes in contrary in canines, Tepoxalin causes inhibition for COX-2 and 5-LOX enzymes. For felines, Tepoxalin is prescribed in doses between 5 and 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days. Additionally, Tepoxalin can only be prescribed to felines over the weight of 3 pounds (~1.36kgs). When Tepoxalin is administered in cats, a drunken-like state afflicting the central nervous system has been recorded on rare occasions. Ill cat injected with NSAID, Tepoxalin  Equine use  When administered for horses, the formulation can be in a paste, powder or feed-in form which can be fed orally or it can be injected through the vein but no other place in the equine body, as it can cause tissue damage. However, if Tepoxalin is injected repeatedly in the vein for a prolonged period of time, it can also cause tissue damage and edema (trapped fluid in tissue). Chronic inflammatory diseases are the most common diseases in horses. Phenylbutazone was formerly used as treatment, but when administered to horses at high doses, it can develop ulcers of the glandular stomach, oral cavity and colon. Due to the major adverse effects of phenylbutazone, the replacement for Tepoxalin was made to be administered to horses to reduce muscular pain in 2003. In horses, the drug is intravenously administered at 10 mg/kg on a daily dose for 10 days respectively. Doses may be doubled or tripled to treat severe pain, such as laminitis. The plasma (cytoplasm; the main part of the capsule) half-life of Tepoxalin is 4‚Äì8 hours, although the inflammatory entire metabolite (entirety of the capsule) half- life is 24 hours, so single dosing is more efficient for horses. When given at reasonable doses, the drug is non-toxic even when used repeatedly. Case of laminitis  Adverse effects  There is a high incidence of adverse reports received for Tepoxalin by the Centre of Veterinary Medicine. Common side effects of the consumption of Tepoxalin include vomiting, diarrhoea, blood in faeces, loss of appetite, fatigue, thirst, an increase in urination and behavioural changes. In older and sensitive animals, loss of hair and abrasion of the skin may occur. The drug cannot be used by animals during breeding, pregnancy or lactation as the drug can affect the foetus or infants. In animals with a history of internal bleeding or low blood pressure, it can result in perforation of the stomach walls or intestinal mucosa. Older dogs are more prone to the adverse effects. When administered to male canines, there are no effects to the male's fertility. However, when a female canine is treated during the organogenetic period, it may result in embryo foetal toxicity. The outcome of this toxicity is a major reduction in foetal weight, incomplete formation of various bones and other skeletal malformations. In extreme cases, it can result in the death of the foetus. Overdose can occur if administered in an excessive large dose. Signs of overdose or toxicity in canines and felines include tremors, seizures, abnormal behaviour, vomiting and weakness.

The school has been an IB World School since August 2000, and CIS-accredited as of March 2008. The school consists of two campuses. The South Campus for grades 0-5 is located at Guldhedsgatan while the North Campus for grades 6-10 is located on Molinsgatan, in metropolitan Gothenburg. Both campuses are connected to the transport System of Gothenburg; the North Campus is located at the tram stop \\"Kapellplatsen\\" while the South Campus is located at \\"Wavrinskys Plats\\", which is only two stops away from the other campus. The gym is located on the South Campus. The Head of school is Birgitta Sandstr√∂m Barac and the principal is currently Graham Miselbach. The deputy principal for the Gotaberg campus is Corinna Ljungberg and the deputy principal for the Guldheden campus is Marilyn James. Former Head of the school was Tage Gumaelius. Currently, 90 teachers work at ISGR and teach over 1000 students who are from 65 different countries.  The National Programme LGR M & P  The National Programme at ISGR offers a Swedish education for grades 0 - 9 students. As in the International Programme, all the grade 0 - 5 students are situated at the South Campus, and all grade 6 - 9 students are situated at the North Campus. Admission priority is given to residents living in central Gothenburg, Majorna, Linn√© and √ñrgryte.  The International Programme MYP & PYP  The International programme begins from PYP 0 up to the diploma programme, also known as MYP 10. The PYP section (0-5) is located on the Guldheden campus, and the MYP programme (6-10) is located on the G√∂taberg campus. Originally the 6th grade was located in the Guldheden campus, but due to lack of space was relocated to the G√∂taberg campus. Priority is given to students from outside or who have lived outside Sweden. Lunch The food that the students get from the cafeteria (locally known as \\"bamba\\") comes from Hvitfeldtska Gymnasiet. MYP 8 and above students have the privilege to go off campus and often go out to buy food as the school is located close to the city. The food provided is usually pasta, fish, meat, rice, and sometimes hamburgers or burritos. There is always a vegetarian option. Exchange Programs Currently, the school has 3 ongoing exchange programs, 10th grade offers two opportunities for students taking Spanish or French, going to Spain and France respectively. While 7th graders taking Spanish also have the chance to go to Spain. School fees and government subsidy All of the school's stocks are owned by the Gothenburg Region Association of Local Authorities. Due to the increased costs and limited government subsidy from the school offering the international programme, the school has to charge school fees to all international students in the International Section (except for year 10 students). The cost for the 2017-2018 academic year is 31,745 SEK or approximately 4000 USD. The students who have remained at the school since 2009 only have to pay 5000 SEK a year.

Family MacLeod's family were from the Isle of Skye where his father owned Skeabost. Jacko, as the family called him, was the youngest son of Duncan MacLeod CBE who had interests in the whisky industry. He was sent to Fettes College in Edinburgh for his education. He married Rosemary Theodora Hamilton Wills, from a Gloucestershire family, in 1938.\\"Marriages\\", The Times, 9 December 1938. They had two sons and three daughters. He worked running a centre which sold articles woven by crofters on the family's land. Army service In 1935 MacLeod had joined the Territorial division of the Cameron Highlanders. During the Second World War he served as a captain with the 51st Highland Division in France in 1940, and was taken prisoner in June at Saint-Valery-en-Caux when the Division surrendered. He spent the rest of the war as a Prisoner of war. Election to Parliament When repatriated at the end of the war, MacLeod avidly read The Times for three weeks to get up to speed on British affairs before entering into politics as a candidate for Ross and Cromarty in the 1945 general election. MacLeod was adopted by the Ross-shire Liberal Association, which was not affiliated to the Liberal Party or the National Liberal Party; he declared himself a supporter of Winston Churchill.F. W. S. Craig, \\"British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949\\" (Parliamentary Research Services, 1977). Most of the press designated him as a Liberal National and he faced a straight fight with the Labour Party to succeed Malcolm MacDonald. MacLeod had no difficulty in being elected, winning with a majority of 4,102. MacLeod had intended to take the Liberal whip in support of Sir Archie Sinclair, the Liberal leader, who represented the neighbouring constituency but Sinclair was narrowly defeated in the same election.Memoirs, Jo Grimond (1979) Parliamentary contributions MacLeod concentrated on constituency interests including hill farming during his time in Parliament. In 1947 he led the textile group of the Highlands Advisory Panel which organised a tour of the area for the Secretary of State for Scotland and a group of experts, aiming to build up the industry.\\"Survey Of Highlands And Islands\\", The Times, 16 August 1947. Because of his specialist interests, he was a low-profile MP. Transport concerns At the 1950 general election and thereafter, MacLeod described himself as a \\"Liberal and Conservative\\" candidate, the National Liberals having merged with the Conservative Party. From 1951, he was an official candidate and he backed the Conservatives in Parliament; however on issues which he felt adversely affected his constituents he was willing to break party lines. One such issue was transport. In 1954, he joined with five other Scottish Conservative MPs to move for the annulment of a 10% increase in rail freight charges.\\"M.P.s move against new freight charges\\", The Times, 27 February 1954. He was highly critical of Ernest Marples in the early 1960s, asking rhetorically in 1963 \\"Has the Minister given up on the Highlands altogether?\\";\\"Inquiry Into Road Haulage Licensing System\\", The Times, 30 April 1963. later that year MacLeod abstained rather than support the Beeching Axe of lesser-used rail services.\\"Six Conservatives Abstain\\", The Times, 1 May 1963. MacLeod also pressed for more and better roads around the highlands, particularly on the basis of improving tourism.Eric Linklater, \\"Demand For A Road Round The Remote West\\", The Times, 1 December 1956. In 1960 he moved a motion condemning the state drink monopoly in three Scottish towns (Annan, Dingwall and Invergordon) created during the First World War and obtained all- party support for its ending.\\"M.P.s Attack State Drink Monopoly\\", The Times, 21 March 1960. Defeat Despite his rebelliousness, MacLeod's standing in his local community was recognised when he was Knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours List in 1963. He was however defeated at the 1964 general election by the Liberal Party candidate Alasdair Mackenzie, and then left politics. He returned to the tweed looms of Portree where he designed many new patterns which he continued to sell across the world. His later years were dominated by a long illness.

He specialised in drawing caricatures. Biography Rafty was born in Paddington, New South Wales into a family of Greek origin. As a boy he first started drawing caricatures whilst caddying during the Depression. During World War II, Rafty served as a war artist and journalist for the Australian Army, serving in New Guinea, Borneo and Singapore. He sketched the surrender of the Japanese in Singapore, and covered the release of POWs from prison camps, including Batu Lintang camp in Kuching, Sarawak. He completed many sketches of war action including a memorable one of Lord Louis Mountbatten. A few years later he covered the Indonesian War of Independence, and befriended President Sukarno of Indonesia. His considerable number of works from that era are housed in the National Library and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, with others held at the Imperial War Museum in London. Rafty caricatured politicians, sportspeople, and entertainers. He sketched sportsmen and women at every Olympic Games from 1948 (in London) to 1996 (in Atlanta). His work has been exhibited worldwide and over 15,000 of his caricatures have been featured in newspapers and magazines. In 1981 Rafty became the world's first caricaturist to have subjects appear on national stamps, with caricatures of sportsmen Victor Trumper , Walter Lindrum , Sir Norman Brookes and Darby Munro appearing on stamps issued by Australian Post. He also provided courtroom sketches for news bulletins on the Seven Network.

Rafty was one of the founding members of the Australian Black and White Artists Club and served as its president; for 23 years he was on the Board of Directors of the Sydney Journalists Club, where he also held the position of President; he also served the Australian War Correspondents‚Äô Association, and for many years, led the Australian War Correspondents Society veterans at the Anzac Day march. In 1985, Rafty was awarded the Gold Cross of Mount Athos, one of Greece's highest honours, and in 1991 he was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for services to the media. Sir William Dargie, an Australian artist, eight-time winner of the Archibald Prize, and war artist with Rafty in World War II commented: ‚ÄúTony Rafty is simply splendid. He not only brings an intellectual quality to his work, but he does it so well within a social context that he creates subjects which have a life of their own.‚Äù Personal life Rafty was married to Shirley Morey for 66 years, the daughter of the New South Wales Labor politician Tom Morey. Shirley died in 2012. They had five children. In 2005 Rafty celebrated his 90th birthday. He died in an Eastern Suburbs hospital in Sydney, NSW from complications of pneumonia, three days before his 100th birthday.

The Oliver Hastings House is a historic house Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is a National Historic Landmark, noted as an excellent example of Greek Revival architecture. It was the home of Oliver Hastings, a local builder. The house was constructed by Hastings in 1844 adjacent to the home of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (now the Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site). The house consists of two main dwelling stories topped by a hip roof that has a central monitor providing a partial third floor space. The building is in a T shape, with a rear section that extends one bay beyond the sides of the main front block. It has broad stripped pilasters at the corners, and a cornice with dentil molding. Its most prominent architectural feature is the rounded portico of the front facade, which is flanked by full-height windows on either side. Iron grillwork forms accent the second floor exterior, and the first floor of the portico has fluted Corinthian columns. Although the exterior of the house has been well preserved, the interior has been altered, particularly by its 20th century institutional owners. It was later the home of William Lawrence, professor and Dean of the Episcopal Theological School and subsequently Bishop of Massachusetts. The house was purchased by the Theological School in 1950. It now forms part of the Brattle Street campus of Lesley University and Episcopal Divinity School, serving as the university's Office of Advancement and Alumni Relations. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. It was further included in the Old Cambridge Historic District in 1983.

It aired on PBS in the United States and on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom in 2004. Overview The series, intended to recreate daily life in Plymouth Colony in 1628 along the lines of the recreated Plimoth Plantation, brought home to viewers the rigors of life for colonists in the early 17th century. The show was videotaped in a 1000-acre isolated area near Machias, Maine, and featured colonists and several members of the current Passamaquoddy tribe of Maine. Historians from Plimoth Plantation and Maine historian and archaeologist Emerson Baker of Salem State College helped to make the setting as accurate as possible.Colonial House. About the Project. About the Experts  PBS Seventeen applicants were chosen out of thousands to join the project. Most of the participants were American, though there were some British citizens as well. The project began in spring and was set to run for five months. Colonists Original Colony: * Jeff Wyers - Governor (in 21st century life, a Baptist minister). From Waco, TX * Tammy Wyers - Governor's Wife * Bethany Wyers - Governor's Daughter * Amy Wyers - Governor's Daughter * David Wyers - Governor's Son (age 9) * Don Heinz - Lay Preacher / Acting Governor / Governor (in 21st century life, Professor of Religious Studies at California State University in Chico), age 63 * Carolyn Heinz - Preacher's Wife (in 21st century life, Professor of Anthropology) * Paul Hunt - Governor's Servant.

For main staples they were given a ton of wheat and half a ton each of oats and dried peas. Drink was also communal and rationed: 1 firkin of wine, 1 firkin of aqua vitae, and 1 barrel of beer. In the first episode, the colonists trade with the Passamaquoddy people to secure a supply of maize (indian corn) to be planted in the large field near the settlement. The corn was planted on mounds instead of rows, in keeping with the First Nations traditional method. Social Hierarchy In keeping with the social order of the 17th century, the Governor of the colony was appointed by the Colony to have full authority over the other colonists. The Freemen were property- holding men who were asked to give council in meetings. Women, indentured servants and children were neither allowed at the meetings nor given any political power. In 'Colonial House', though, the women were unsatisfied with losing all of their modern rights and spied on the Freemen's meetings and started to hold women's meetings themselves. After the Wyers family leave in Episode 2, the women begin to bargain for a more fair split of labor, which is resisted by the Freemen and Acting Governor. Although mandated by law to attend Christian church services on Sunday, the participants in the project are of varied beliefs, which causes some tension. The Wyers family is strongly Christian while Michelle Voorhees steadfastly refuses to \\"say the words\\" of the Christian prayers. Events Episode One * (Ep. 1) Near the beginning of the series, Danny Tisdale explains that simply going through the process of application for the show has changed the way he understands his own identity as an American of African descent, knowing that his grandmother Tulip Tisdale was a slave in the Americas. * (Ep. 1) John Voorhees explains one of his motivations for joining the project was to meet a variety of people from different backgrounds and gain a sense of community, something he felt was missing from his work life. * (Ep. 1) On the second day, the colonists get their first glimpse of natives around the settlement. John Voorhees says that his heritage is Paiute he feels uncomfortable with the tension between the colonists and the natives. Nine-year-old David Wyers is unsure whether they are \\"real Indians, like real, like colonial times. It's not like they live right now, how they always lived.\\" Tammy Wyers explains to her son that the native people are \\"Still dangerous. Don't you watch the 10 o'clock news?\\" Episode Two * (Ep. 2) During the first Sabbath service, Julia Friese is overcome with emotion while hearing Bethany talk about her faith, and is inspired to \\"strive to be something better\\". * (Ep. 2) The Passamaquoddy traders return with a gift of a dead muskrat, which they help the colonists prepare for dinner‚Äîthis is the colony's first fresh meat. * (Ep. 2) The Wyers family receives shocking news from home: Bethany's fianc√© was killed, and the eldest Wyers son seriously injured, in a car accident. They depart the colony immediately, but father Jeff returns after ten days, at the beginning of Episode 3. * (Ep. 2) The colonists hold a community dance and bonfire to raise morale since the loss of their leader. Episode Three * (Ep. 3) The Voorhees family (possibly led by Michelle) decide not to go to the Sabbath meeting, due to a conflict with their beliefs, breaking one of the major rules of the time period. Governor Wyers is particularly disturbed by this choice, worried that the \\"anarchy\\" will spread to other families. The Governor administers punishment to those who broke rules, and Michelle Voorhees is hobbled by her ankles and left tied to a stake outdoors for a few hours. * (Ep. 3) After the Voorhees' transgression, and with Paul and Amy Kristina punished for profanity and the bachelor Freemen also declining to attend Sabbath worship, Governor Wyers comes to the reluctant conclusion that punishment for not attending Sabbath is \\"unenforcable\\" and are damaging the workforce. Without consulting his counselors, the laws respecting attendance of the Sabbath are then suspended. Lay Preacher Don Heinz is displeased with this decision, feeling the integrity of the project has been compromised. * (Ep. 3) The Wyers family return after a five-week absence, with eight new colonists. Episode Four * (Ep. 4) The colony has expanded from 13 to 24 residents. Dominic expresses that the new influx of people and noise has caused him some anxiety and he \\"keeps having to run away and hide\\". * (Ep. 4) Dominic leaves a note and disappears for two days \\"to explore\\". Don Wood understands that Dominic \\"needs a lot of alone time\\". Dominic wanders outside the 1000-acre boundaries of the project and into modern roads and town. Although he has broken a major rule, he apologizes to the community for causing them worry and faces no punishment. * (Ep. 4) Jonathon Allen comes out as gay to his masters, Don and Carolyn Heinz, after feeling depressed and outcast for much of the project. He later comes out publicly at Sabbath and feels greatly relieved. However, Jeff Wyers takes a dark view of the news and is clearly displeased. He says \\"Jonathon came out in a church setting. It seemed like a somewhat strange time and place. Some people applauded... I didn't applaud. All men have sin... one step toward God... is seeking help. We must learn to master ourselves. Not pat each other on the back.\\" However, Governor Wyers chooses not to punish Jonathon, although the Puritan punishment for homosexuality was death. * (Ep. 4) Amy Kristina-Herbert leaves the project early, as planned, reflecting the historical event that many colonists gave up colonial life to return to England. She explains that part of the reason she \\"wanted to do this project, as a Black American, is that this is the beginning of the country I live in. My roots do not come from Puritanism, but this is the beginning of America and I am American. People need to stop thinking of just white people when they think of America. They need to ... see faces that aren't white. Me, a black girl, braids my hair in a Pilgrim outfit. ... It's no more ridiculous than trying to classify who's more American than them.\\" * The salted meat is discovered to be moldy, at a time when rations are running low and the four one-room houses are overcrowded. * Governor Wyers suspends production and instructs the men to build a house for the Verdecia family of five. Episode Five * David Wyers celebrates his 10th birthday during the project. * The salted fish is discovered to be rancid. The colony now has very little meat. A hunting party is sent into the forest but again return unsuccessful. The Governor instructs the servants in killing and butchering one of the sheep. * With only ten men in the workforce, labor is slow. Danny Tisdale feels increasingly uncomfortable in the colony, recognizing that \\"There is a need for cheap labor... this idea of indentured servitude leads directly to slavery\\". He decides to leave the project, saying goodbye only to the Governor and his wife. His departure is deeply mourned by Governor Wyers. * Members of the Passamaquoddy tribe return with furs to trade, but Governor Wyers is unable to come to an agreement with them. * The Wyers family receives news that their elder daughter Amy is facing hospitalization at home and decide to leave at once. Don Heinz is appointed Governor. * Carolyn, Michelle and the other women start holding meetings in which they plan political influence over their husbands in order to secure rights for the women. This echoes the story of Anne Hutchinson in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Episode Six * Members of the Wampanoag people approach the colony but stay out of sight. * The corn is harvested. * The servants are asked to cut firewood, but Jonathon is asked to make maps of the colony and Dominic sketches the Governor's portrait. * Governor Heinz suggests starting a school, choosing Jonathon and Dominic to learn ancient Greek. He points out that Harvard College would be founded just 8 years later. Many of the lower-ranking colonists display irritation at this show of favoritism. Episode Seven * Members of the Wampanoag people make contact with the colony. They joined the project to experience how their ancestors lived in 1628 and express a \\"gut feeling of discomfort\\" at seeing the colonists' houses for the first time. * Ramona Peters speaks to the gathered colonists and explains that in 17th-century America \\"Everyone had the freedom to practice religion except the Native Americans\\". The Wampanoag people make a pact among themselves not to accept any food from the settlers, but one person breaks the agreement, sparking a reaction from Nancy Eldredge: \\"We just don't want it to appear like 'happy Indians with the first Thanksgiving, Colonial' because it wasn't that way at all. ... If we were being treated in a good way even today and our land wasn't still being taken ... then it would be fine.\\" * The colonists had made an agreement with the Passamaquoddy not to trade with any other people and choose to pass up the valuable trading opportunity with the Wampanoag. Episode Eight * The colonists are evaluated by a team of historians. New Zealand version A New Zealand version of the series was produced by TVNZ. The series features the Huttons from South Otago, a 21st-century family chosen to 'time travel' back to 1852 to live in a colonial house.

Based on Kenneth Cook's 1961 novel of the same name, it follows a young schoolteacher who descends into personal moral degradation after finding himself stranded in a brutal, menacing town in outback Australia. Filmed on location in Broken Hill and Sydney, Wake in Fright was an international co- production between Australia and the United States. Alongside Walkabout, it was one of two Australian films to be nominated for the Grand Prix du Festival at the 24th Cannes Film Festival. Despite attracting positive reviews at the time, the film was a commercial failure in Australia, in part due to scant marketing by United Artists, as well as controversy surrounding its portrayal of outback life, including a hunting scene in which real kangaroos are shot and killed. By the 1990s, Wake in Fright had developed a cult reputation as Australia's great \\"lost film\\" because its master negative had gone missing, resulting in censored prints of degraded quality being used for its few television broadcasts and VHS releases. After the original film and sound elements were rescued by editor Anthony Buckley in 2004, the film was digitally remastered and given a 2009 re-release at Cannes and in Australian theatres to widespread acclaim; it was issued commercially on DVD and Blu-ray later that year. Wake in Fright is now considered a pivotal film of the Australian New Wave,Rapold, Nicolas (4 October 2012). \\"'Wake in Fright' and Australian New Wave\\", The New York Times. Retrieved 12 January 2012. earning praise from contemporary critics for Kotcheff's direction and the cast's performances. A televised miniseries remake of Wake in Fright premiered in 2017. Plot John Grant is a young, middle-class schoolteacher who feels disgruntled because of the onerous terms of a financial bond that he signed with the government in return for receiving a tertiary education. The bond has forced him to accept a two-year post at a tiny school at Tiboonda, a remote township in the arid outback. It is the start of the Christmas holidays, and John plans on going to Sydney to be reunited with his girlfriend Robyn, but first he must travel by train to the nearby mining town of Bundanyabba ‚Äì known by the locals as \\"The Yabba\\" ‚Äì in order to catch a Sydney-bound flight. Upon arriving at The Yabba, John goes to a pub, where he meets the local policeman, Jock Crawford, who befriends him after both drink repeated glasses of beer at the pub and an RSL club, where they witness an unnerving ANZAC memorial service. Crawford then introduces him to the illegal game of two-up, and to Clarence \\"Doc\\" Tydon, a vagrant, alcoholic medical practitioner who questions John's contemptuous view of The Yabba and its populace. Deciding to try his luck at two-up, John has a winning streak but becomes reckless: in a desperate bid to win enough money to pay off his bond and escape his indentured servitude as an outback teacher, he loses all of his cash in two rounds. This results in John becoming stranded in The Yabba, leaving him at the mercy of its searing heat and eccentric but sinister townsfolk. While drinking, John becomes friends with a resident named Tim Hynes and goes to Tim's house, where he meets his adult daughter, Janette, and his two friends, miners Dick and Joe. Tim, Dick and Joe engage in an all-day drinking session, where they are eventually joined by Doc. John converses with Janette, who quietly desires a life outside of waiting on her father and his friends. She tries to seduce John, who vomits due to the beer he has ingested. After engaging in more debauched rituals with the Hynes and their guests, John finds refuge in Doc's isolated shack. After providing him with medicine to cure his hangover and feeding him on kangaroo meat, Doc expounds his worldview onto John, revealing that his alcoholism and self-sufficient attitude to life prevented him from practicing in Sydney. He also reveals that he and Janette have had a long- standing open relationship punctuated by unorthodox sexual encounters. John and Doc are joined by Dick and Joe in a drunken, barbaric kangaroo hunt that lasts into the night, which culminates in Joe engaging in fisticuffs with one such kangaroo and John clumsily stabbing another to death. The four then vandalize a bush pub, where Dick and Joe engage in a playful fight that turns brutal, interrupting Doc as he lectures an unconscious John about the violent nature of civilization despite its philosophical and materialistic trappings. At dawn, John returns to Doc's shack, where Doc initiates a homosexual encounter between the two.\\"Wake in Fright\\", Radio National review by Julie Rigg, 26 June 2009 Repulsed, John leaves that morning and returns to town, where his two suitcases, left behind at a hotel after he met Tim, are returned to him by Crawford. After discarding one suitcase ‚Äì mostly containing textbooks, including one on Plato ‚Äì he wanders through the desert towards Sydney, hitch-hiking with truck drivers where possible and procuring food using the rifle he was given during the hunt. He eventually arrives at a truck stop, where he persuades a driver he assumes is heading for Sydney to give him a lift. However, due to miscommunication, John returns to The Yabba instead. Enraged with Doc and his perversity, John rushes to his empty cabin, intent on shooting him upon his return. However, he becomes overwhelmed with loneliness and remorse, and turns his rifle on himself. Doc arrives to witness John shoot himself in the temple, the impact of which scars but fails to kill him. John recovers in the hospital, and signs a statement from Crawford explaining that his suicide attempt was an accident. Several weeks later, Doc takes him to the railway station, where they quietly make peace with each other. No longer contemptuous of the outback's inhabitants and more assured of himself, John returns to Tiboonda to begin the new school year. CastProduction Bundanyabba is a \\"thinly disguised portrait\\" of Broken Hill, where much of the film was shot. A film adaptation of Kenneth Cook's 1961 novel Wake in Fright was linked with the actor Dirk Bogarde and the director Joseph Losey as early as 1963. Morris West later secured the film rights and tried, unsuccessfully, to raise funding for the film's production. The rights were eventually bought by Australian company NLT Productions and American firm Group W Films and Canadian director Ted Kotcheff was recruited to direct the film. At the time of production, Kotcheff had only directed three films. After Wake in Fright, Kotcheff would continue to have a successful career as a director. His later films included The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1973), Fun with Dick and Jane (1977), First Blood (1982) and Weekend at Bernie's (1988). Robert Helpmann was initially hired to play the role of Doc Tydon, but he was replaced with Donald Pleasence due to scheduling conflicts. Actor Michael York stated in a 1980 interview that he turned down a role in the film due to being offended by the kangaroo hunting scene. The shooting of Wake in Fright began in January 1970 in the mining town of Broken Hill, New South Wales (the area which had inspired Cook for the setting of his novel), with interiors shot the next month at Ajax Studios in the Sydney beach-side suburb of Bondi. It was the last film to feature the veteran character actor Chips Rafferty, who died of a heart attack prior to Wake in Frights release, and the first film with Jack Thompson, a future Australian cinema star, among its cast members. Release The world premiere of Wake in Fright (as Outback) occurred on opening night of the 1971 Cannes Film Festival on 13 May. Ted Kotcheff was nominated for a Golden Palm Award. The film opened commercially in France on 22 July 1971, Great Britain on 29 October 1971, Australia during the same month and the United States on 20 February 1972. Reception Wake in Fright found a favourable public response in France, where it ran for five months, and in the United Kingdom. However, despite receiving such critical support at Cannes and in Australia, Wake in Fright suffered poor domestic box-office returns. Although there were complaints that the film's distributor, United Artists, had failed to promote the film successfully, it was also thought that the film was \\"perhaps too uncomfortably direct and uncompromising to draw large Australian audiences\\". During an early Australian screening, one man stood up, pointed at the screen and protested \\"That's not us!\\", to which Jack Thompson yelled back \\"Sit down, mate. It is us.\\" In his 1972 review for The New York Times, Roger Greenspun praised the film for its atmosphere \\"of general foreboding that crystalizes often enough into particular terror and that is not quite like anything else I can remember feeling at the movies. Certain science-fiction films come closest to it, especially those in which some evil alien presence has taken over a community that to all outward appearances remains normal‚Äîwith only the slightest most fugitive hint that something somehow is hideously wrong.\\"Greenspun, Roger (February 21, 1972). \\"Screen: 'Outback' Opens\\". The New York Times. 37. A review of the Cannes premiere in Variety called it \\"a creditable effort\\" from the Australian film industry, \\"even allowing for the fact that key technical and acting credits are British. The end result is a forceful glimpse of little-known territory in which the emphasis is on booze and violence, with a touch of sex for good measure.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Outback\\". Variety. May 26, 1971. 22. Gillian Hanson of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Canadian director Ted Kotcheff has captured the mindless brutality of life in the outback with extraordinary felicity ... Yet, despite its unmistakable competence, the film's bite is blunted by the script's shallow and largely unmotivated characterisation of John Grant, and by the loosely-knit and over-melodramatic story line which never achieves thematic coherence.\\" The un-restored version of Wake in Fright received a three stars (out of four) rating from the American film reviewer Leonard Maltin in his 2006 Movie Guide, while Brian McFarlane, writing in 1999 in The Oxford Companion to Australian Film, said that it was \\"almost uniquely unsettling in the history of new Australian Cinema\\". Askmen.com echoed these sentiments, citing that \\"it's not hard to see why the dusty savagery and clown-faced surrealism of Ted Kotcheff's fourth feature was never shown on telly at the time.\\" Following the film's restoration, Wake in Fright screened at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival on 15 May 2009 when it was selected as a Cannes Classic title by the head of the department, Martin Scorsese. Wake in Fright is one of only two films ever to screen twice in the history of the festival. Scorsese said, \\"Wake in Fright is a deeply -- and I mean deeply -- unsettling and disturbing movie. I saw it when it premiered at Cannes in 1971, and it left me speechless. Visually, dramatically, atmospherically and psychologically, it's beautifully calibrated and it gets under your skin one encounter at a time, right along with the protagonist played by Gary Bond. I'm excited that Wake in Fright has been preserved and restored and that it is finally getting the exposure it deserves.\\" Roger Ebert reviewed the re-release and said \\"It's not dated. It is powerful, genuinely shocking and rather amazing. It comes billed as a 'horror film' and contains a great deal of horror, but all of the horror is human and brutally realistic.\\" Don Groves of SBS gave the film four stars out of five, claiming that \\"Wake in Fright deserves to rank as an Australian classic as it packs enormous emotional force, was bravely and inventively directed, and features superb performances.\\" American critic Rex Reed, an early advocate of Wake in Fright, praised the film's restoration as \\"the best movie news of the year\\", and said it \\"may be the greatest Australian film ever made\\".Reed, Rex (2 October 2012). \\"A Beautiful Nightmare\\", The New York Observer.

Murdoch Books Pty Limited. 9781743366165. Controversy In addition to the film's atmosphere of sordid realism, the kangaroo hunting scene contains graphic footage of kangaroos actually being shot. A disclaimer at the conclusion of the movie states: The hunt lasted several hours, and gradually wore down the filmmakers. According to cinematographer Brian West, \\"the hunters were getting really drunk and they started to miss, ... It was becoming this orgy of killing and we [the crew] were getting sick of it.\\" Kangaroos hopped about helplessly with gun wounds and trailing intestines. Producer George Willoughby fainted after seeing a kangaroo \\"splattered in a particularly spectacular fashion\\".

Retrieved 7 January 2013 Kotcheff, a vegetarian, has defended his use of the hunting footage in the film. Restoration and home-media releases For many years, the only known print of Wake in Fright, found in Dublin, was considered of insufficient quality for transfer to DVD or videotape for commercial release. In response to this situation, Wake in Frights editor, Anthony Buckley, began to search in 1994 for a better-preserved copy of the film in an uncut state. Eight years later, in Pittsburgh, Buckley found the negatives of Wake in Fright in a shipping container labelled \\"For Destruction\\". He rescued the material, which formed the basis for the film's painstaking 2009 restoration. Evidently a 35mm print in excellent condition had also survived in the collection of the Library of Congress, which screened it in the library's Mary Pickford Theater in 2008, although its reported running time of only 96 minutes suggests this was an edited version. Wake in Fright was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats by Madman Entertainment on 4 November 2009, based on a digital restoration completed earlier that year. This restoration was shown to the general public for the first time at the Sydney Film Festival in June 2009, and in re-release has been called \\"a classic Australian film which has achieved cult status\\".

Original station restoration The city, in collaboration with BNSF, Amtrak, the Iowa Department of Transportation, the Southeast Iowa Regional Planning Commission, and the North Lee County Historical Society (NLCHS), has worked since 2006 to restore the old Santa Fe station to accommodate an Amtrak waiting room and ticket office as well as exhibition and storage space for the NLCHS museum, which moved into the old depot in 1972. Unfortunately, the depot remained susceptible to high water and was flooded several times in the late 20th century. Eventually, the city decided to sponsor a project to lift the depot off of its foundation, construct a new five foot high concrete base, and lower the building back into place; this work occurred during 2011. The total cost of the depot raising and restoration project is estimated at $3.2 million, and the city obtained funds from a diverse array of grant programs, including $1.5 million through the Federal Highway Administration‚Äôs Transportation Enhancements program and $1.13 million through I-Jobs, a state investment program designed to renew Iowa‚Äôs infrastructure, promote long-term economic growth, and help create and retain jobs.

Central and Wan Chai Reclamation is a project launched by the government of Hong Kong since the 1990s to reclaim land for different purposes. This includes transportation improvements such as the Hong Kong MTR Station, Airport Express Railway & Central-Wanchai Bypass, as well as public recreation space such as the Central Harbourfront Event Space, Tamar Park and the Hong Kong Observation Wheel. Background The project was first mentioned in the 1985 planning strategy by the Government.150 Years of Hong Kong Harbour and Land Development, Ho Pui- yin, Commercial Press. The Government then completed a feasibility study in 1989, followed by endorsement of the then Land Development Policy Committee on the project. Objectives The proposed reclamation extends along the waterfront from Sheung Wan to Causeway Bay. The ostensible objectives of the project, among other things, include: *to supply land for the Hong Kong Station and the extended overrun tunnel of the Airport Express; *to provide land for Central-Wan Chai Bypass and Island Eastern Corridor Link to replace Connaught, Harcourt, Gloucester and Victoria Park Road from Route 4; *to offer land for the upcoming Sha Tin to Central Link; *to give land for the potential North Island Line; *to improve the surroundings of neighbouring crowded districts by providing supplementary open space on the new reclamation; and *to integrate the development with the existing areas. The project Victoria Harbour as of 2005-10-14, viewed from City Hall, Central. Note that Central Reclamation Phase 3 has just started. Central Reclamation Phase 3 during January 2008 Central Reclamation Phase 3 during June 2009 Central Reclamation Phase 3 during Jan 2015 The project is divided into five phases. Central ReclamationCentral Phase I= The Central Reclamation Phase 1 involved reclaiming 20 hectares of land, plus redevelopment of 6 hectares of land, between Rumsey Street and Pedder Street, for the construction of Hong Kong Station of the Airport Express Railway. It also provided land for new piers, replacements of other facilities affected by reclamation. Works started in 1993 and were completed in June 1998. This phase of reclamation is part of the Airport Core Programme. The cost was HK$2,710 million. Upon completion of the project, the coastline of Central was extended up to 350 metres beyond the original coastline.Central Reclamation (Phase 1) =Central Phase II= The Central Reclamation Phase 2 reclaimed 5.3 hectares of land at the former Tamar naval base. The reclamation formed land for the Tamar Site, and also five commercial development sites. Works started in December 1994 and were completed in September 1997. The cost was HK$320 million.Hong Kong Harbour Reclamation ‚Äì FactBox ‚Äì Central Harbour Reclamation Phase 1 & 2 It has been proposed that a new complex housing the headquarters of the Government and the Legislative Council be built on the reclaimed land. =Central Phase III= The Central Reclamation Phase 3 involves reclamation for the overrun track of Airport Express, the west section of the proposed North Island Line and the Central-Wan Chai Bypass, new Star Ferry piers, new roads, and other facilities. The cost is HK$3,561.5 million. It was originally planned to reclaim 32 hectares of land, but has been reduced to 18 due to public opposition. Works have started on 2003-02-28. Above-ground construction is scheduled to be completed in 2011. The underground Central-Wan Chai Bypass has opened on 20 January 2019. Wan Chai Development Project New Wan Chai Pier Wan Chai Reclamation Phase 2 during Oct 2014 =Wan Chai Phase I= Wan Chai Reclamation Phase I (also known as 'Island Reclamation for the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre Extension') includes the formation of an island of 70,000 m¬≤ by reclamation at the northern side of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre to supply land for building an additional room to the Centre. The island configuration is to ensure that water quality in the vicinity remained at satisfactory levels after reclamation was completed. Works commenced in March 1994 and were completed in July 1997. =Wan Chai Phase II= Wan Chai Development Phase II extends along the water's edge from the Central Reclamation Phase III to Causeway Bay. This HK$10.5-billion project, together with Central Reclamation Phases I, II and III, is mainly to provide land for the construction of the Central-Wan Chai Bypass and the Island Eastern Corridor Link, the Hong Kong Island section of the Shatin-to-Central Link and the North Island Line.Wan Chai Development Phase II ‚Äì Project Overview, CEDD Construction work commenced in 2009 and is planned to be completed in 2017.Central and Wan Chai Reclamation ‚Äì Wan Chai Development Phase II , CEDD Because of the multi-faceted nature of the project, involving road creation, land reclamation and foreshore development, the project is overseen jointly by Highways Department and Civil Engineering and Development Department, who together commission a single contractor for each location involved. The works involve the temporary reclamation ‚Äì for a period of several years ‚Äì of Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter and the former public cargo working area. In a judicial review before the Court of First Instance, it was held in March 2008 that the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance applied to such works, and hence the government was required to demonstrate an 'over-riding public need' for the reclamation. It undertook to keep the temporary reclamation \\"to the minimum\\" and to reinstate the seabed after completion of the construction works.Central ‚Äì Wan Chai Bypass and Wan Chai Development Phase II Temporary Reclamation .., Legco Discussion Paper CB(1)232/08-09(06), 25 November 2008 Controversy=Public protests Not everyone welcomed with the reclamation plan warmly. Some Hong Kong residents thought the action was totally unnecessary; it did nothing good, merely reducing the size of Victoria Harbour. Instead of building a bypass, the opponents urge the government to start an electronic road toll scheme in the community. On 5 October 2003, over 1,000 protesters dressed in blue marched on the Central Government Offices calling for a halt to reclamation work in the harbour.Agence France-Presse, Thousands join protest against harbour reclamation , The Standard, 6 October 2003 They also promised to follow up with a three-pronged protest next month using land, sea and air to get their message across. The march was one of several protests in recent weeks over harbour projects, which the government says are necessary to ease traffic congestion in Central strictly due to the increase in private cars (the number of commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles have decreased over time). The government had lost the first round of a court battle, but then appealed against the decision. The Society for Protection of the Harbour (SPH) applied for a stay of order and judicial review on 25 September 2003, prohibiting the government from continuing with the third phase of the Central reclamation project. The government resumed work to reclaim 230,000 m¬≤ of the harbour after the society failed in its bid to get hold of a court order to provisionally halt work ahead of December's judicial review. Teddy Ng, Bid to halt harbour work , The Standard, 26 September 2003 In September 2004, legislator Law Chi-kwong took a swim in Victoria Harbour bearing a plaque saying \\"Goodbye to the Queen\\", to protest the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation, particularly the loss of Queen's Pier.Legislator in protest swim , Associated Press, 8 September 2004 Further public furore erupted in late 2006 when it was revealed the plans would involve the destruction of two notable 50-year-old landmarks at the waterfront, namely the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier and Queen's Pier. Both have become potent symbols for environmentalists, who have staged protests and rallies in the light of strong public opinion to preserve the collective memory of Hong Kong. Judicial review The SPH requested judicial reviews on the Reclamation, on 27 February 2003 and 25 September 2003 respectively. On 6 October 2003 the High Court announced that the Government may proceed with the Central Reclamation, however on 1 September 2004 the Court of Final Appeal rejected the Town Planning Board's proposal on the draft Wan Chai North outline zoning plan (OZP), and the Wan Chai Development Phase 2 had to be reviewed. In an effort to soften opposition to the reclamation project, the Government proposed that the reclaimed land above the underground transport infrastructure could be used to construct a world-class waterfront promenade. Marine pollution In October 2003, Greenpeace said that the Central reclamation would create 580,000 cubic metres of toxic silt, 63% of which was classified as \\"seriously contaminated\\" by the Environmental Protection Department. The activists were repelled when they attempted to collect mud samples from the Central reclamation site for analysis.Matthew Lee, Mud in eye for activists , The Standard, 30 October 2003 The Government was accused by Greenpeace of using \\"cheap and outdated\\" dredging methods during reclamations which leak toxic waste into the harbour. It stood accused also of dumping the dredged toxic waste in outlying island sites near an artificial reef created to protect marine life such as the Chinese white dolphin. Fishermen reported that average catch had been cut by half since the reclamation started.Dennis Chong, Harbour poisoned: activists , The Standard, 10 November 2003 The Government responded that reclamation \\"would not cause irreversible marine damage.\\" Tender The Government was found to have breached World Trade Organization tendering rules in awarding the contract by unfairly changing the tendering conditions of the third phase of the reclamation after the tender was closed. However, the WTO ruling was not legally binding.

W. Waterhouse (1916) A study for the painting, c. 1886, in a private collection The Magic Circle is the name of two 1886 oil paintings in the Pre-Raphaelite style by John William Waterhouse. The paintings depict a witch or sorceress using a wand to draw a fiery magic circle on the earth to create a ritual space for her ceremonial magic. History The larger version of The Magic Circle was shown at the Royal Academy in 1886, and, after Consulting the Oracle and St. Eulalia, was Waterhouse's third exhibit with a supernatural theme in as many years. The painting was well received at its exhibition, and was purchased for ¬£650 the same year by the Tate Gallery, through the Chantrey Bequest. The painting was extremely successful with the critics and public alike. The smaller 1886 version of The Magic Circle measures 88 cm (34.6 in) high and 60 cm (23.6 in) wide. It is held by a private collector.2013 Sothebys sale Waterhouse painted a c. 1886 study for The Magic Circle, 61.5 cm (24.2 in) high and 41.2 cm (16.2 in) wide, also held by a private collector. He initially sketched the composition in a sepia pen and ink version in 1880‚Äì1881. The Magic Circle was recently on display at the National Gallery of Australia as part of the Love and Desire exhibition (December 2018 ‚Äì April 2019).https://nga.gov.au/lovedesire/ Description In a style typical of Waterhouse, the main character is a lone, female figure, placed centrally on the canvas. The surrounding landscape is hazy, as though it is not quite real, and the background figures are only discernible on close inspection, deliberately ensuring the witch is the only image of importance. Waterhouse paid careful attention to the angles employed in this work, balancing the circle the figure is drawing around herself by the use of a triangle ‚Äì her straight arm, extended by the straight stick, held out at 25 degrees to her erect body. The witch's power is emphasised by the determined face, by her exclusion of the ravens and frog ‚Äì popular symbols representing magic ‚Äì and by her command over the smoke pillar. Instead of billowing outwards or being affected by the wind, it remains in a straight line. A live snake ouroboros loops around the woman's neck. The Magic Circle is similar in composition to Waterhouse's later 1916 painting, Miranda - The Tempest, which also portrays a woman associated with magic. Miranda wears a similar dress to the witch in The Magic Circle, and her face can also only be seen in profile. Unlike Frederick Sandys' portrayals of sorceresses, such as his 1864 Morgan le Fay and 1868 Medea, Waterhouse chose to make his witch's face intent and intriguing, as opposed to malevolent. Themes Miracles, magic and the power of prophecy are common themes in Waterhouse's art. More specifically, the notion of woman as enchantress is one that recurs in images such as Circe Offering the Cup to Ulysses (1891, Oldham Art Gallery) and Hylas and the Nymphs (1896, Manchester City Art Gallery). His oeuvre also includes a number of Middle Eastern subjects, in which he drew on the work of contemporary artists such as J. F. Lewis (1805‚Äì76) and Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836‚Äì1912), rather than on actual experience. This is one of Waterhouse's earlier works, and reflects his fascination with the exotic. Theories An article in the Pre-Raphaelite Society journal, The Review, has hypothesised that Waterhouse may have painted an image of his own face into The Magic Circle and that the image is only viewable at a specific required distance from the painting. The article also suggests that it may have been possible to achieve that distance by viewing the painting through reversed binoculars or opera glasses. An accompanying documentary, Inside the mystery of JW Waterhouse's The Magic Circle, presents the visual argument. In contemporary culture Harry Furniss created a number of parodies of The Magic Circle, including one in Punch showing actress Sarah Bernhardt tending a cauldron and another in an exhibition The Magic Circle, or There's Nothing like a Lather by Soap-and- Waterhouse.https://web.archive.org/web/20161118150849/http://johnwilliamwaterhouse.com/articles/caricature- soap-and-waterhouse/ Popular culture The Magic Circle was part of the Harry Potter: A History of Magic exhibition at the British Library in 2017.

Distribution and habitat The sunbird breeds in southern South Africa. It is mainly resident, but partly migratory in the northeast of its range. It is common in gardens, fynbos, forest edges and coastal scrub. Description The sunbird is 14 cm long. The adult male has a glossy, metallic green head, throat upper breast and back. It has a broad brilliant red band across the chest, separated from the green breast by a narrow metallic blue band. The rest of the underparts are pale grey. When displaying, yellow feather tufts can be seen on the shoulders. As with other sunbirds the bill is long and decurved. The bill, legs and feet are black. The eye is dark brown. The male can be distinguished from the similar lesser double-collared sunbird by the latter's smaller size, narrower red chest band and shorter bill. The call is a hard chut-chut-chut, and the song is a high pitched jumble of tweets and twitters, richer than the calls of the lesser double-collared sunbird. Behaviour The sunbird is usually seen singly or in pairs. Its flight is fast and direct on short wings. Breeding The sunbird breeds all year round, with a peak from July to November. The closed oval nest is constructed from grass, lichen and other plant material, bound together with spider webs. It has a side entrance which sometimes has a porch, and is lined with feathers. Feeding It lives mainly on nectar from flowers, but takes some fruit, and, especially when feeding young, insects and spiders. It has the habit of hovering in front of webs to extract spiders. It can hover like a hummingbird to take nectar, but usually perches to do so. Call The Greater Double-Collared Sunbird makes a shrill whistle and click: Wrew wrew wrew ch ch.

He also represented Britain in world championships from 1926 to 1933. He was born in Wandsworth, London. He rode for the South London Norwood Paragon cycling club, broke numerous time trial and Road Records Association place-to-place records in domestic competitions, winning the first four British Best All-Rounder (BBAR) competitions from 1930 to 1933. Records He broke his first record on Easter Monday in 1925, when he won the Etna time trial on the Bath Road course in 2h 8m 31s, beating the record by five minutes. He followed this by breaking the one-hour record at Herne Hill Velodrome on 26 May by almost 1400 yards to record 25 miles 1520 yards.History of Norwood Paragon CC - 1925 He then improved the 50-mile record in the same event the following year and broke the world amateur hour record with 26 miles and 838 yards at Herne Hill in June 1926. Southall was selected by the National Cyclists' Union to represent Britain at the 1926 UCI Road World Championships, where he finished in eighth place.History of Norwood Paragon CC - 1926 In 1927, Southall again broke the record in the Etna event, recording 2h 5m 7s. On 24 July, he broke the RRA London-Brighton and back record by 13 minutes, with 4h 53m 20s.History of Norwood Paragon CC - 1927 On 5 August 1928 in Amsterdam, with Harry Wyld, Percy Wyld and Leonard Wyld, he broke the team pursuit Olympic record in 5:01.6, beating the previous record by 9.2 seconds. They were only the third team to hold the record since it began on 10 August 1920. It was broken by 10.2 seconds next day before standing for nearly eight years.Olympic.org Records, Cycling - Track In 1930, Southall finished seventh in the world road race championship (an individual time trial in Denmark) and broke the national time trial record with 4h 32m 46s.History of Norwood Paragon CC - 1930 In 1933, Southall and Stan Butler rode the Oak Tandem 100, winning in 4h 1m 3s, beating the record by two minutes. Southall now held six single and tandem competition records (25, 50 and single and 30, 50 and tandem).History of Norwood Paragon CC - 1933 Olympic controversy The Olympic road race in Amsterdam in 1928 was run against the clock, as an individual time-trial. It was the last to be disputed that way. Southall was one of the best performers in the world against the clock but in he lost seven minutes to Henry Hansen of Denmark. Bill Mills of the News Chronicle wrote: :The British team sent over for the 1928 Games at Amsterdam was probably the best that ever left our shores. It included the great Frank Southall, unbeatable in time-trials on the road... Our best chance was in the road race, a 165km ( miles) time-trial, and a sensation was caused when Southall was beaten into second place by the Dane, Harry Hansen, who took 4h 47m 17s against Southall's 4h 55m 6s. British officials lodged a protest, alleging that Hansen had not covered the full course, but it was proved that he had and the result stood.Mills, W.J. (contrib), 1948, The Story of the Olympic Games, ed. Binfield, R.D., Oxford University Press, UK British officials protested that Southall had been 90 seconds behind Hansen at 50 km but that 34 km later the lead had stretched to eight and a half minutes. They insisted that Hansen had neither gone faster nor Southall slower. Southall had been riding fast enough to take back a minute in the last half of the race. They suggested that the Dane had taken a short cut. The judges turned down the protest and Hansen received the gold medal. What happened remains a mystery. Southall and the officials believed they had been cheated. But another member of the team, Jack Lauterwasser did not believe it then and never changed his mind. \\"I couldn't see where anything like that could have happened. It seemed to me that it would have been impossible to go off-course\\", he said.Price, Mike (2000), Days of Gold and Glory, privately published, UK Southall finished sixth in the Olympic road race in 1932, with Charles Holland 15th and Stan Butler 16th. The Great Britain team finished fourth overall. In the team pursuit, Britain, with Southall, beat Canada to take bronze.

In 1935, a team of Australian cyclists, including Hubert Opperman 'Hefty' Stuart and Ern Milliken traveled to England to attack various distance records.

Assessment The weekly paper, The Bicycle, said of him: :The versatility of the great Norwood Paragonian, Frank Southall, thrilled the cycling world of the 1920s and 1930s. No matter what branch of the sport he turned to, road time trials, paced races on the track, road records or track records, he dominated his contemporaries. In addition to his speed, he had the personality that attracts the crowd, and any track meeting billing 'F.W.S.' versus, say, Harry Wyld (his great rival at the paced game) was certain of a packed house. Although he raced on almost every road course in this country, and competed in many events abroad... world's championships and Olympic Games... he was always at his best on his 'home ground', the Brighton Road, and his RRA record for the London to Brighton and back which he set up in 1935 (he covered the 104 hilly miles in 4h 38m 27s) still stands.The Bicycle, UK, 23 April 1941, p17 References Category:1904 births Category:1964 deaths Category:English male cyclists Category:English track cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Great Britain Category:Cyclists at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1932 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain Category:People from Wandsworth Category:Sportspeople from London Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 1928 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1932 Summer Olympics ","title":"Frank Southall"},{"id":"10455076","text":"Danspace Project is a performance venue for contemporary dance.

It was planned as a feeder to carry water from springs near the town of Wendover in Buckinghamshire to the main line of the Grand Junction Canal at Bulbourne near Star Top End in Hertfordshire, but when it opened in 1799 it was made navigable, as the extra cost of making it so was small. Water supplies from Wendover were found to be inadequate, and a series of reservoirs were built. A pumping station at Whitehouses was superseded by the Tringford pumping station in 1817; its steam engines were replaced by diesel engines in 1911 and then by electric pumps. The canal was used for the carriage of coal to three gasworks, and for transport of straw to London and horse manure in the opposite direction. It was also used by the Heygates flour mill, and Bushell's built boats on its banks. Despite several attempts to rectify leakage, including one of the earliest uses of asphalt for this purpose, no satisfactory solution was found, and most of the canal ceased to be used for navigation in 1904. Water levels in the upper section were lowered, and a pipeline was constructed along part of the bed, so that water could still be supplied to Tring summit. The canal became part of the Grand Union Canal in 1929, and responsibility passed to British Waterways in 1963. Initial attempts to reopen the canal following the formation of the Grand Union Canal Society in 1967 were unsuccessful, but interest revived in 1985, and soon after a decision by the Department of Transport in 1988 to build a navigable culvert where the new Aston Clinton bypass would cross the arm, the Wendover Arm Trust was formed. The Trust split the task of reopening the canal into three phases, and phase 1 of the project, the first from the junction at Bulbourne to a winding hole near Little Tring Farm, was completed and reopened in 2005. Using Bentonite matting, they relined the section which leaked so badly and at Easter 2015 the first of phase 2 were filled with water for the first time since 1904. Another section was expected to be rewatered in 2016, and a bid made for Heritage Lottery Funding to speed the completion of phase 2. History When James Barnes was planning the route for the Grand Junction Canal, he was faced with the problem of crossing the Chiltern Hills. Since ancient times, roads had passed through the Tring Gap, a low saddle in the hills near Tring, and Barnes opted for this route. The main line of the canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. A second Act was obtained on 28 March 1794, which authorised the construction of branches to Buckingham, Aylesbury, and Wendover. On its journey through the Chilterns, the main line reaches a height of at Tring summit. From the south, it ascends through a series of locks which follow the valleys of the rivers Gade and Bulbourne to reach Cowroast Lock. After a relatively short summit, the canal starts its descent at Bulbourne, picking up the valley of the River Ouzel. Each boat crossing the summit level draws off nearly of water; Barnes knew that local water supplies would not be sufficient to sustain this. Wendover is located on the north-facing escarpment of the Chiltern Hills, with a chalk aquifer feeding natural springs which could supply water all year round, and so the Wendover branch was conceived as a non-navigable feeder, to carry water from the springs and streams in the area to the Tringford reservoirs which fed the Tring summit. However, the cost of widening it was small, and so it was always a navigable channel from the time of its completion in 1799. The remains of Whitehouses pumping station following excavation in 2015 The water supply was supplemented by mill streams, which were diverted into the canal after the company bought out mills at Wendover, Halton and Weston Turville. They also built Weston Turville reservoir in 1798, which was used to supply the mills in Aylesbury, whose water supply had been diverted into the canal. The reservoir was also used to replenish the canal and, as milling technology developed, this became its primary purpose. A steam pump was installed in 1814 which fed water to the canal through underground pipes. Although only installed as a temporary solution, it continued to operate until 1839. It soon became clear that the supply of water from Wendover was insufficient, and in 1802 the first of four reservoirs was constructed. Wilstone reservoir was followed by Marsworth, completed in 1806, Tringford, completed in 1814 and Startops End, completed in 1815. The banks of Wilstone reservoir were raised in 1811 and 1827, and extensions in 1835 and 1839 increased its size four- fold. It now has a capacity of . There was a pumping station at Whitehouses, which pumped water from the reservoir into the canal. It housed a Newcomen engine which operated until around 1835, but the station was demolished when pumping was concentrated at Tringford. Tringford pumping station was built in 1816 and 1817, and contained a Boulton and Watt beam engine. The cast-iron beam was long, and the single cylinder was in diameter, with an stroke. A second steam engine was added when the station was extended between 1836 and 1838, after which Whitehouses was demolished. A building to house diesel engines was added in 1911, and the second steam engine was scrapped in 1913. Following removal of the beam engine in 1927, the height of the main engine house was reduced. The diesel engines were later superseded by electric pumps. Operation The canal was used for the carriage of coal, timber, straw and manure. Straw was shipped to London, for use as bedding for horses, and horse manure was transported in the opposite direction, from the bus depots of London, to be used as fertiliser on farms in the locality. Coal was delivered to Aston Clinton House from the canal, and to three gas works, which were located at Wendover, Halton and near Bucklandwharf bridge, which carries the old route of the A41 road over the canal. The coal came from the Midlands, and was used to produce coal for lighting. The Gas Works at Aston Clinton survived until 1964. In 1875, Heygates flour mill was built on the banks of the canal at Gamnel Bridge. It was powered by steam engines, for which the canal supplied the water. Grain was delivered by boat, and the processed flour was transported away by boat. After the end of the Second World War water transport was superseded by trucks, and in 2013 the mill operated a fleet of 16 trucks to deliver flour to markets in the south of England. Next to the flour mill was a boat yard belonging to Bushell Brothers of Tring. There had been a boat repair business on the site from 1850, and Bushell's was established in 1875. As well as building and maintaining wooden boats for several small and medium-sized carrying companies operating on the canal network, they also trained a number of craftsmen who later held important positions at other boat building yards. The business closed in 1952. Very few original wooden boats survive, and only one built by Bushell's is known to exist. Roger was built in 1936 for Arthur Harvey-Taylor, a coal merchant and carrying company based at Aylesbury, and worked until 1968. After a period in use as a residential boat, and a period of dereliction, restoration was completed in 2000 by the Rickmansworth Waterways Trust, with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is on the National Register of Historic Vessels. Other notable boats built at the yard and launched into the canal included a tug named Bess, built during the First World War, which was designed to pull ten 100-ton barges, and a tug named Progress, which was the largest boat built by Bushell's. Tools and other objects used at Bushell Brothers, as well as other various old tools that one of the Bushell brothers, who was always interested in rural crafts, collected during his retirement, were donated to the Museum of English Rural Life in 1963. Decline Disused section of the canal near Wendover The Wendover Arm itself had a working life of 100 years. Part of its downfall was that some sections leaked. Much of it was repuddled within 10 years of its construction, to try to prevent some of the leakage. There is speculation that a section called The Narrows was lined with concrete and faced with bricks to prevent leakage into a large neighbouring property, Aston Clinton House, but this is unconfirmed. The company tried using asphalt to line the canal in 1857, but that failed after 13 years, due in part to inexperience in the use of the material. In 1897, which was drier than usual, the Grand Union company decided that the arm was leaking more water than it was supplying, and stop planks were used to block off the arm at Little Tring. The stop planks were replaced by a stop lock, which was operational by 1901. By 1904 the canal company had decided to abandon the arm as a navigation. The top were again repuddled, the water level was lowered, and all of the water flowing along it was fed into Wilstone reservoir. This put an extra load on the pumps at Tringford, as the Wilstone reservoir is at a lower level than the Tringford one. A pipeline was therefore laid from a sump at Drayton Beauchamp to the Tring pumping station, along the bed of the disused canal, so that water arrived at the pumps at a higher level. The new system was still not satisfactory, due to the large variations in flow along the feeder, and it was redesigned in 1912. After reconstruction, the water was pumped directly into the main line, with surplus water flowing into Tringford reservoir. The section of canal between Wendover and Drayton Beauchamp remained in water, resembling a chalk stream. In 1917, German prisoners of war built a railway bridge over it near Wendover. The standard gauge railway line was used to remove timber from Wendover Woods, and also supplied Halton Camp, a base for the Royal Flying Corps, which subsequently became RAF Halton. The line was in use until 1963, and the bridge was demolished as a training exercise by sappers in 1965. A footbridge was subsequently erected in the same location. The Wendover Arm, as part of the Grand Junction Canal, became part of the Grand Union Canal on 1 January 1929, when an agreement between the parent company and the Regents Canal was authorised by Act of Parliament. Following nationalisation in 1948, responsibility for the canal passed to British Waterways in 1963 and then to the Canal & River Trust. Revival Interest in the arm was revived in 1967, when the Inland Waterways Association held a public meeting in Watford to debate the future of the Grand Union Canal. In February 1967 the Grand Union Canal Society was formed, and later began campaigns to reopen both the Slough Arm and the Wendover Arm. The initial plan failed due to a lack of local interest, and because the legal position was not sufficiently strong to mount a successful campaign. In 1979 the Grand Union Canal Society was worried that nature conservation lobbying might lead to the arm being closed to boats completely, so it organised a campaign cruise to Little Tringford Pumping Station, the head of navigation at the time. By 1985 there was enough interest in reviving the arm that a separate Wendover Arm Group was formed, which included members from the Grand Union Canal Society, the Inland Waterways Association, the Aylesbury Canal Society and representatives from local boat clubs. They planned a two-stage project, involving first the section from Tringford Pumping Station to Aston Clinton, where the A41 road crossed, with a second stage covering the remainder of the route into Wendover. In 1986 the group published a report called Water to Wendover, to highlight its plans. Their position was strengthened in 1988 when the Department of Transport announced that the Aston Clinton bypass would include a navigable culvert where the new road would cross the arm. This led to the formation of the Wendover Arm Trust, and the identification of the arm by the Inland Waterways Association as one of the ten restoration schemes most likely to benefit from its backing. Wendover Arm Trust In February 1989 the Wendover Trust was formed as a charitable trust with the aim of restoring and promoting the canal. The organisation is also registered as a private company limited by guarantee with Companies House. The trust is funded primarily by donations (with some funding from British Waterways, now known as the Canal & River Trust). The major fund- raising activity was an annual canal festival which began in 1990; however a site is no longer available to run this, and new funding is being sought. Phase 1 Reinstatement of Little Tring Road bridge was completed in 2001. Phase 1 of the restoration involved the first of the canal from Bulbourne Junction () to Little Tring Farm (). Major engineering work included the refurbishment of the stop lock, and the construction of a winding basin at the terminus, to allow boats to turn round. Between the two, Little Tring Road crossed the course of the canal on an embankment which was constructed in 1973 when the original bridge was demolished. This was replaced by a new reinforced concrete bridge, built to a traditional design, which is faced with bricks to give it an authentic appearance. It was funded by the Wendover Arm Trust, and the award-winning bridge was completed by British Waterways in 2000‚Äì01 at a cost of ¬£223,000. In 2003 the Association of Independent Navigation Authorities (AINA) published a report called Demonstrating the value of waterways, in which they outlined methods for assessing restoration projects, and their likely social and economic benefits. British Waterways produced a report in the following year, called Waterways 2025 ‚Äì Our vision for the shape of the Waterways Network, which used many of the methods suggested by the AINA report to identify 18 restoration schemes which they thought might be completed before 2025, and which they would support. The Wendover Arm appeared in the list, but the report was abandoned two years later, after other groups claimed that not being included undermined their ability to raise funds. The Phase 1 project was completed on 28 March 2005, when the refurbished section between Tringford stop lock and the new winding basin was opened. Construction had been finished in November 2004, and the new section was re-watered during March 2005. The total cost of this phase was ¬£400,340. Phase 2 Relining the dry canal bed near Drayton Beauchamp in April 2009 Phase 2 involves a dry section from Little Tring to Drayton Beauchamp (), and includes the navigable culvert under the Aston Clinton bypass. Original plans drawn up in the late 1990s for converting the A41 to a dual carriageway and bypassing Aston Clinton included a low level crossing of the canal, which would have prevented restoration. However, negotiations resulted in the Highways Authority funding a diversion of the canal to a point where there was sufficient headroom for navigation. The Trust argued that an pipe to carry away rain water from the road would be insufficient in storm conditions, and that excavating of new canal would be a better solution. The old route of the canal has become a reed bed, acting as a settling pond for water from the road, before it joins the new channel. British Waterways funded restoration of a further through Drayton Beauchamp bridge, where repairs to the feeder pipeline which runs along the bottom of the canal were needed to prevent flooding in the village. The pipeline will not be needed once the work is completed. However it will remain in place under the canal, and is having to be capped with concrete to prevent the restored canal collapsing into it. As work proceeds, the channel is being re-profiled, and then lined with Bentomat liner, which consists of a layer of Bentonite clay sandwiched between two layers of geotextile. Concrete blocks have been laid over the liner on the side walls of the channel, with turf above water level. As each new section is re-profiled, the spoil removed is used to cover the bed of the canal on the previous section to a depth of . While the phase one section is navigable by broad-beamed boats, the phase two section will only accommodate narrow boats. The re-profiled channel has sloping sides, which benefit wildlife but do not allow mooring, and so three mooring recesses have been built. Around of this section were rewatered at Easter 2015, and although water levels were initially kept lower than the design depth, the channel successfully held water for the first time in 120 years. The rewatered section runs eastwards from Drayton Beauchamp, rather than connecting to the section which is already navigable, and a further was expected to be rewatered during 2016. To speed up progress, the Trust considered using contractors for some of the work, and in November 2015 submitted a bid for a grant of ¬£1.9 million to the Heritage Lottery Fund. Phase 3 Phase 3, from Drayton Beauchamp via Buckland Wharf () and Halton () to Wendover (), requires major engineering work to three road bridges. This section has never been de-watered but is environmentally sensitive. The channel will require dredging, with work to improve the towpath and probably to raise and strengthen some of the banks. The canal passes the site of Aston Clinton House, owned by Sir Anthony de Rothschild and his descendants from 1853 to 1923, and subsequently used as a school and hotel. The property and its grounds were acquired by Buckinghamshire County Council between 1959 and 1967, and the house was demolished, to be replaced by Green Park Training Centre. This location has been suggested as a site for a trailboat festival in 2020. The canal ends at a wider section, which was the location of Wendover Wharf, beyond which is a gauging station on the feeder supplying the canal. Route Phase 1 Little Tring Bridge to Winding Basin The Phase 1 head of navigation near Little Tring Farm The water supply for the canal originates to the south of Wendover in surface springs and artesian wells near Wellhead Farm and the grade II* listed church of St Mary, which is constructed of flint rubble and blocks of stone. Much of it dates from the fourteenth century, although it was heavily restored in 1839 and 1869. The water flows northwards through the town, past a former water mill, which was operational until 1923, but was converted into a house between 1929 and 1931. It enters Wendover Basin, the start of the canal, where the flow is monitored by a gauging station. Records of the flows exist for the period between 1841 and 1897, and from 1963 onwards, making it the earliest known set of such records in the United Kingdom. The canal runs in a northerly direction, with a towpath on the western bank, and is crossed by a footbridge at the site of the branch line to Halton Camp. The start of a channel which connects the canal to Weston Turville reservoir is marked by a paddle on the towpath. The reservoir, which is a designated nature reserve, covers , and is used for fishing and by Aylesbury Boat Club for sailing. The canal loops around the east and north of the village of Halton, passing under Perch bridge and Halton bridge, after which it runs in a generally north-easterly direction. There is a footpath on both sides of the canal at this point. As it reaches the edge of RAF Halton, there is a grade II listed bridge made of ornamental ironwork, with piers of ashlar stone and brick. Halton House is a large country house, built between 1881 and 1883 for Alfred de Rothschild, which has been used as an officers mess since 1919. At Harelane bridge, the footpath on the left bank stops, and the towpath continues on the right bank. On the opposite side to the towpath is Green Park, once the grounds of Aston Clinton house, where there is a wharf, and a swing bridge once gave access from the grounds to the towpath. The next crossing is Bucklandwharf Bridge, which carries the former A41 road, and the towpath crosses back to the left hand bank at this location. Just beyond it is an accommodation bridge, which allows residents to reach a row of cottages. As the canal approaches the A41 bypass, the old bed has been turned into a reedbed, to filter the runoff from the road before it enters the canal. A paddle controls the flow into the canal, which has been diverted to the south, to pass under the road where it is at a higher level. Beyond the crossing, the channel rejoins its original course, and continues to Drayton Beauchamp bridge. The section beyond the bridge contained the culvert to maintain the flow to Tringford pumping station, some of which has now been rewatered, and is the location for the current restoration work by the Wendover Arm Trust. The canal crosses the border between Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, and then there are two wooden footbridges, erected in 2007 to provide easier access to the canal bed while it was being restored. The second one is on the site of a swing bridge which carried a road from Tring to Wilstone reservoir. Between them, the remains of Whitehouses wharf and pumping station have been excavated. Part of the canal was filled with rubbish in the early twentieth century by the local authority, and was excavated by bottle collectors before restoration began. There is no towpath on a short section to Little Tring bridge, but walkers can follow a minor road to rejoin the canal, which is navigable at this point. A public footpath follows the right bank for most of the way to Gamnel Bridge, but leaves the canal to join the B488 road at Tring. A permissive path runs along the left bank, passing the grade II listed Tring pumping station, Heygates flour mill, and the site of Bushell's Boat Yard. This is the only part of the canal which was built on an embankment, rather than following the contours of the land. Gamnel Bridge dates from 1797, and is a narrow hump-backed bridge, constructed of brown bricks with a red brick arch and blue brick decoration and copings. To the left of the final section is Tring Sewage Treatment Works, built in the late nineteenth century by the Urban District Council, assisted by funding from Nathan and Emma Rothschild. Its outflow normally supplements the water in the canal. However, between July 2012 and April 2013, the inlet screens failed to operate correctly on several occasions, and the canal became polluted with sewage sludge and debris. The Environment Agency prosecuted the operators, Thames Water, who were fined ¬£1 million, the largest fine ever imposed for such a prosecution. Thames Water subsequently replaced the inlet screens at a cost of ¬£30,000. The Arm joins the main line of the Grand Union canal at a footbridge which carries the towpath, next to which is a toll house. To the north, the main line starts its descent through the Marsworth locks, while to the south it continues on the level to Bulbourne and beyond.
