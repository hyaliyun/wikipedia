It is also referred to as sashi-kogin. It is generally made with white cotton embroidery in diamond patterns on blue linens. During the Edo period, peasants were not permitted to wear cotton cloth in the Tsugaru region, so cotton thread was added to linen cloth with the aim of bypassing these regulations and making clothes more protective during the harsh winter weather, as well as strengthening the cloth. History Kogin patterns as depicted in Sadahiko Hibino's \\"Ouminzui\\", written in 1788 During the Edo period, peasants were not permitted to wear cotton cloth in the Tsugaru region. Peasants initially attempted to stay warm by wearing multiple layers of linen, but the fabric frayed easily. As a solution, cotton thread was added to linen cloth with the aim of bypassing the regulations and making clothes more protective during the harsh winter weather, as well as strengthening the cloth. Later, during the Meiji period, the class system was abolished. This enabled the use of cotton in clothing for everyone in the former holdings of the Tsugaru, and embroidering dyed indigo cloth with white cotton thread became more common. As the access to materials increased, competition to design the most beautiful patterns rose, with an estimate of over 300 different kogin-zashi patterns being created. In the twentieth century the craft was streamlined, establishing the three general types that are seen today: nishi-kogin, higashi-kogin, and mishima-kogin. The Hirosaki Koginzashi Institute has sought to preserve and promote kogin-zashi since the 1960s. In 1996, kogin-zashi was given the status of a traditional craft item of Aomori Prefecture. In the present-day, elementary school students in Aomori Prefecture learn how to hand-stitch the pattern. Variations =Nishi-kogin= This pattern originated in the area west of the city of Hirosaki. Stripes placed on the shoulders of clothing are arranged in a horizontal pattern. This was done to increase their strength while carrying goods over the shoulder. =Higashi-kogin= This pattern originated in the area east of the city of Hirosaki, in today's Minamitsugaru District. It lacks the stripes that are seen in the other two varieties and uses mostly diamond shapes. =Mishima-kogin= This pattern originated in the area north of the city of Hirosaki. The area was not as well-off as other parts of the Tsugaru region, suffering from poor harvests caused by the earlier onset of the harsh winter. As a result, patterns were smaller than seen in other areas due to the lack of material. Horizontal stripes are used, though not as heavily as seen in nishi-kogin patterns.

It is popular in North China and commonly performed by the Manchu ethnic group for shamanist priests. As the years passed by, it became a way for people to express the joyfulness and happiness. The Taipinggu was originated in the Tang dynasty and prospered in Qing Dynasty, with a history of more than 2,000 years. There are two widely known kinds of Taipinggu, one is in Western Beijing and another kind is invented in Lanzhou, China. Classification The Jingxi Taipinggu () is of folk dance for entertainment. With a widespread mass base and deep historical roots, it plays an important role in folk activities. Taipinggu had been popular in Western Beijing since the Ming Dynasty, and it became very popular in the early Qing Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty, taipinggu was spread to the Mentougou District. Almost everyone from many villages in Mentougou District was able to play the taipinggu historically. Taipinggu was played in the imperial palace on Chinese New Year's Eve, so it was also called \\"yingniangu (the drums played to welcome the Chinese New Year)\\" in Beijing. The time to play the taipinggu most is the twelfth and the first month of the lunar year. It is attractive and popular in local calendric folk customs, and people play it to express their best wishes for a time of peace and prosperity. Playing the taipinggu can not only enhance the festive atmosphere but also reflect the festive customs of Beijing area in a traditional way. Performing the Taipinggu is a symbol of the cultural identity of local people. The Lanzhou Taipinggu () in Gansu Province has been long known as the \\"crown of drum dances\\" worldwide, with a history of more than 600 years. It is popular in the Chinese cities such as Lanzhou, Yongdeng, Jiuquan, Zhangye, Jingyuan, etc. Lanzhou's Taipinggu is cylinder-shaped, with drum body 70‚Äì75 cm high, drumhead 45‚Äì50 cm long in diameter, and drum weight 19‚Äì22 kg. Its upper and lower surfaces are covered by cow leather, painted with such patterns as two dragons playing with a pearl. Its strap is long enough to be hungover shoulders, facilitating percussion and helping a drummer throw it to any direction.

A djenging is visible on the upper left. Djenging is a type of large double- outrigger plank boat built by the Sama-Bajau people of the Philippines. It is typically used as a houseboat, though it can be converted to a sailing ship. It was the original type of houseboat used by the Sama-Bajau before it was largely replaced by the lepa after World War II. Larger versions of djenging were also known as balutu or kubu, often elaborately carved with bifurcated extensions on the prow and stern. Description The djenging is made from a dugout keel (baran balutu) built up at the sides with two planks (tapid and lingkam) attached by dowels. It is usually around long, though it can commonly reach up to in length. It is usually equal-ended, with the prow and the stern indistinguishable from each other. It has two to four outrigger booms (batangan) attached to bamboo floats (katig) which are parallel to the main hull. The tips of the floats do not extend beyond the prow and stern. Secondary booms (sa'am) also extend from the hull and function as extensions of the removable deck (lantay) made of split bamboo. A central house-like structure known as the palau is located in the middle, similar to the vinta and the lepa. The palau can be taken down to erect a mast and convert the ship into a sailing ship for transport or fishing. Larger versions of djenging are known as balutu or kubu. They are often permanently moored around anchorages (sambuangan). They were elaborately carved with okil designs painted with bright colors, with the typical bifurcated extensions on both the prow and the stern known as buaya (\\"crocodile\\"). The house structure of the balutu is known as the kubu (hence the name), and unlike in smaller djenging, it is permanently attached. They are propelled by poling or by paddling. Djenging and balutu are very similar to the vinta, but differs mainly in the shape of the hull section and the relative lengths and placement of the outriggers. Conservation As of the 1990s, balutu have almost completely disappeared among the Sama-Bajau of Tawi-Tawi and the Sulu Archipelago. Djenging have also started to disappear. They are replaced by the outrigger-less lepa, which are easier to sail, as they do not require the house structure to be taken down.

The rumors of the possible adaptation of Batang Quiapo as a TV series began when the film's theme, Doon Lang, was performed by Martin in a \\"duet\\" with Fernando Poe Jr. as the clip of the scene from the film was being played; said scene originally featured Poe and Maricel Soriano singing in a duet. Martin has himself expressed interest in adapting more of Fernando Poe Jr.'s works for film and/or television, as he had also previously adapted another Poe classic Carlo J. Caparas' Ang Panday which was an entry into the 2017 Metro Manila Film Festival. In addition to the interest Martin has in adapting the series for the small screen, several names had been linked to the planned remake as a potential leading lady, such as Liza Soberano and Martin's rumored girlfriend, Julia Montes. Rumors of its supposed impending adaptation further intensified when Martin met with Manila Mayor Isko Moreno. The meeting though did not have anything to do with the adaptation of the film but was made to negotiate Moreno's cameo appearance in Martin's 2019 Metro Manila Film Festival entry, 3pol Trobol: Huli Ka Balbon!

It had its origins in a signal company of the Royal Engineers formed in 1908 and during World War II it provided the divisional signals for the 56th (London) Division and its duplicates as well as communications for the Royal Air Force in the Middle East. Its successors continued in the postwar Territorial Army and Army Reserve until 2016. Origin When the Royal Corps of Signals was created in 1920 the 56th (1st London) Divisional Signals was formed in the Territorial Army (TA). It was reformed from the former 1st London Divisional Signal Company of the Royal Engineers (RE), which had served through World War I.Lord & Watson, pp. 168‚Äì70.Nalder, Appendix 4, pp. 606‚Äì7. =Royal Engineers= When the old Volunteer Force was subsumed into the Territorial Force after the Haldane reforms in 1908, the East London (Tower Hamlets) Engineers provided the RE components of the Territorial Force's 1st London Division, including the 1st London Divisional Telegraph Company, RE, with the following organisation:Monthly Army List, various dates.London Gazette, 20 March 1908.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141‚Äì7. RE Signal Company at work on the Western Front.* Company Headquarters (HQ) at 10 Victoria Park Square, Bethnal Green * No 1 Section at 10 Victoria Park Square * No 2 (1st London) Section * No 3 (2nd London) Section * No 4 (3rd London) Section Nos 2‚Äì4 Sections were attached to and largely manned by the three infantry brigades of the division. The Telegraph Company was redesignated a Signal Company in 1911. The 1st London Division mobilised on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, and the 1st London Brigade, with No 2 Signal Section, was sent on 4 September to relieve the Regular Army garrison of Malta. The rest of the division's infantry and artillery was progressively sent to France to reinforce the Regulars of the British Expeditionary Force. In February 1915 HQ and No 1 Section of the Signal Company were assigned to 29th Division, newly formed from Regular units brought back from colonial garrisons. On 25 April the division landed at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli Peninsula, and it served through the Gallipoli Campaign until the final evacuation in January 1916. It was then transferred to the Western Front, where it attacked Beaumont-Hamel on the First day on the Somme and then served through the battles of Arras, Third Ypres and Cambrai in 1917 and the German Spring Offensive and Allied Hundred Days Offensive in 1918. After the Armistice the division was sent into Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine. Following demobilisation of remaining Territorial Force elements, the signal company was converted into Southern Division Signals in Germany in November 1919. A Regular unit, this continued until the division disbanded in 1923Becke, Pt 1, pp. 117‚Äì24.Lord & Watson, pp. 222‚Äì3.Nalder, p. 156. Shortly after mobilisation in 1914, the Territorial Force raised 2nd Line units with the same titles as the parents, but with a '2/' prefix, including the 2/1st London Divisional Signal Company in the 58th (2/1st London) Division. This incorporated Nos 3 and 4 Sections of the 1st Line company, which had been left in England when their brigades went overseas piecemeal. In January 1916 the 1st London Division began to reform in France as the 56th (1/1st London) Division, and the whole of 2/1st London Signal Company left 58th Division and joined the reformed division on 16 February as 56th (London) Signal Company. The 56th Division attacked the Gommecourt Salient on the first day on the Somme, and then served through Arras, Ypres, Cambrai and the battles of 1918. After the Armistice Divisional HQ was demobilised in May 1919.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15. =Royal Corps of Signals= The new 56th (1st London) Divisional Signals was formed in 1920 as part of the new Royal Corps of Signals in the reorganised Territorial Army, based at 3 Henry Street, Gray's Inn Road, later moving a short distance to 51 Calthorpe Street. By the 1930s, 56th (1st London) Signals HQ also administered two units of the Supplementary Reserve (SR) at Calthorpe St: * No 1 (City of London) Company, Line of Communication Signals * No 1 (City of London) Base Signal Company, Line of Communication Signals In the 1930s the unit was awarded the supplementary title City of London Signals, but moved its HQ from central London to Signal House, 20 Atkins Road, Clapham Park, accompanied by the SR units, which had expanded into:Lord & Watson, p. 243. * HQ Line of Communication Signals * No 1 Company, Line of Communication Signals * No 4 (City of London) Company, Line of Communication Signals * No 21 (City of London) Cable Section * No 21 (City of London) Construction Section * No 22 (City of London) Construction Section * No 3 (City of London) Air Wing Signal Section Haberdashers' Aske's Hampstead School Cadet Corps (as 1st Cadet Signal Company) and the City of London Signals Cadet Company were affiliated to the unit. The unit's motorcycle despatch riders formed a display team that performed at the Royal Tournament in 1937, precursors of the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team (the White Helmets). In 1935 47th (2nd London) Division was converted into 1st Anti-Aircraft Division and its remaining units were merged into 56th (1st London) Division, which was redesignated simply The London Division, and the signals unit as London Divisional Signals (City of London Signals). The London Division was converted into a Motor Division in 1937. World War II =Mobilisation= When the Territorial Army was doubled in size after the Munich Crisis, the division was duplicated and 1st and 2nd (London) Motor Divisional Signals were formed at Clapham in 1939. Later in the same year the 1st London also formed the London Area Signal Company, which in 1940 became London District Signals providing headquarters communications.Lord & Watson, p. 244. Organisation Leyland Retriever wireless lorry, 1941. In 1939, the organisation of an infantry divisional signal unit and the attachments of its subunits were as follows:Lord & Watson, pp. 262, 314. * HQ ** Q Section ‚Äì quartermasters ** M Section ‚Äì maintenance * 1 Company ‚Äì Divisional HQ ** A & C Sections ‚Äì wireless ** B Section ‚Äì cable ** D Section ‚Äì despatch riders and cipher section ** O Section ‚Äì operating * 2 Company ‚Äì divisional artillery ** E, F & G Sections ‚Äì individual artillery regiments ** H Section ‚Äì HQ divisional artillery * 3 Company ‚Äì infantry brigades, reconnaissance and RE ** R Section ‚Äì reconnaissance battalion ** J, K & L Sections ‚Äì individual infantry brigades * 4 Company ‚Äì attached army tank brigade ** W Section ‚Äì army tank brigade ** X, Y & Z Sections ‚Äì individual tank regiments As the war progressed divisional signals was enlarged to cover the divisional radio telephony (R/T) and wireless telephony (W/T) nets, divisional administrative services, rear communications for brigade HQs, divisional tactical HQ, and air communications. =56th (London) Divisional Signals= Dick Whittington's cat, leading to its nickname of the 'Black Cats'.Edwards, pp. 177, 195, 218. 1st London Division (it dropped the 'Motor' designation in June 1940) was not sent to join the new British Expeditionary Force in France but remained in the UK. After the Dunkirk evacuation the division held the critical south-east corner of England throughout the period of greatest invasion threat. It regained its traditional title as 56th (London) Infantry Division on 18 November 1940.Joslen, pp. 37‚Äì8.Collier, p. 125, Maps 5, 6, 17, 20. From November 1940, 56th (L) Division alternated with 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, being based at Maidstone and the Medway towns until February 1941 and then again from June. In November 1941 the division drove through London to join XI Corps in East Anglia. The division was now fully equipped and undergoing intensive training and in June it came under War Office control while it mobilised for overseas service.Edwards, pp. 127‚Äì32. Middle East and North Africa During August 1942 the division moved to the embarkation ports of Liverpool and Glasgow, and sailed for the Middle East on 25 August. The fast troop convoy reached South Africa safely, but the slow convoy carrying guns and vehicles was heavily attacked by U-boats off the coast of West Africa and lost several ships. From South Africa most of the troops sailed to Bombay, then on to Basra in Iraq, arriving on 4 November and then by road and rail to Kirkuk. 56th Division spent the winter of 1942‚Äì43 training for mountain warfare. In March, 168th (2nd London) Brigade with accompanying units was detached to Palestine. Then the rest of the division began an overland drive to join Eighth Army in Tunisia, driving some between 18 March and 19 April.Edwards, pp. 131‚Äì3.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 441‚Äì2, 453. On 23 April 56th (London) Division went into action for the first time at Enfidaville. The infantry were roughly handled and suffered heavy casualties. The final attack on Tunis (Operation Strike) began on 6 May, the division meeting strong resistance before the Germans surrendered on 12 May. By the end of the month 56th (L) Division had been pulled back to Tripoli to train for the invasion of Italy.Edwards, p. 134.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 453.Molony, Vol V, p. 259. Operation Avalanche 56th (London) Division landed as the right hand half of X Corps at Salerno before dawn on 9 September 1943 in Operation Avalanche. There was bitter fighting for 10 days in the Salerno beachhead and support troops frequently found themselves in the firing line holding off German counter-attacks.Edwards, pp. 136‚Äì8.Molony, Vol V, pp. 276‚Äì7, 291‚Äì2, 296, 310, 321. On 22 September the Allies broke out and X Corps headed north towards Naples. The retreating Germans had blown every bridge across the River Sarno for inland, but 56th Division captured an intact bridge at San Mauro and continued past Naples to Capua, where the Germans were making a stand on the River Volturno. Assault crossings of rivers now became a feature of the campaign, and the signal units had to make special arrangements at assembly points, ensure waterproofing of equipment, and provide beachhead communications on the far side. Divisional HQs normally operated as Main and Rear echelons, sometimes with a small Tactical HQ. During phases of mobile warfare a Main HQ could move every day, and wireless and despatch riders had to be used until lines could be re-established.Edwards, pp. 138‚Äì9.Molony, Vol V, pp. 337‚Äì42, 439‚Äì40.Nalder, pp. 406‚Äì7. A Royal Signals motorcycle despatch rider in Italy, 1943. The division's attempt to cross the Volturno was repulsed, but the neighbouring divisions got across, and 56th (L) crossed by a US-built bridge. 168 Bde Group rejoined 56th (L) Division at Caserta during these operations. After the Volturno, X Corps made rapid progress up Highway 6 until it reached the Bernhardt Line in the mountains round Monte Camino. There was bitter fighting on Monte Camino itself that lasted until its capture on 9 December, when the division was rested.Edwards, pp. 140‚Äì1.Molony, Vol V, pp. 444, 450‚Äì3, 517‚Äì8. The next obstacle in front of X Corps was the lower Garigliano river south of Monte Cassino. 56th (London) Division's attack on the night of 17 January launched the Battle of Monte Cassino. However, fierce counter-attacks prevented X Corps from advancing far beyond the river.Edwards, pp. 142‚Äì3.Molony, Vol V, pp. 606‚Äì16, 632‚Äì4. Anzio On 30 January, 168 Bde was about to resume the offensive on the Garigliano when it was hurriedly withdrawn to reinforce the landing further up the coast at Anzio, which had run into trouble. On 6 February the rest of 56th Division was also withdrawn from the Garigliano and landed as reinforcements at Anzio. The infantry were continually engaged in the Anzio beachhead, and by 25 February were down to less than half strength. On 9 March the exhausted division was evacuated from Anzio.Edwards, pp. 143‚Äì4.Molony, Vol V, pp. 635‚Äì6, 744, 754‚Äì7. 56th Division was now went back to Egypt for rest. On arrival at Port Said it went into camp, leave was granted, and training resumed. On 10 July the refitted division left Port Said to return to Taranto, from where it was sent to join V Corps with Eighth Army on the Adriatic coast of Italy.Edwards, p. 145.Molony, Vol V, p. 757. Gothic Line Massive preparations were required for Eighth Army's assault on the Gothic Line (Operation Olive). V Corps opened the attack on 25 August, and by 1 September the Gothic Line had been cracked open, but 56th (L) Division coming up from reserve still had hard fighting at Monte Capello, Montefiore Conca village and the Gemmano ridge. It finally took Gemmano village on 9 September. After a short rest, the division advanced on 16 September and fought its way to the swollen Fiumicino river by the beginning of October. On 7 October the exhausted division was withdrawn.Edwards, pp. 146‚Äì8.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt II, pp. 225‚Äì6, 231‚Äì2, 249‚Äì52, 260‚Äì1, 267‚Äì8, 277, 353‚Äì4, 402‚Äì4. Argenta Gap In the middle of December the division returned to the line, moving via Forl√¨ to Faenza, where it spent the winter months.Edwards, p. 149.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 120‚Äì4. For 56th (L) Division the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy began on 5 April with an operation to clear a triangle of ground between the River Reno and the south- west corner of Comacchio Lagoon.Edwards, pp. 149‚Äì51.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 215‚Äì6, 259‚Äì60. On the night of 10/11 April 56th Division launched Operation Impact Plain to widen the bridgehead and open the 'Argenta Gap' and on 16 April it took Bastia in Operation Impact Royal.Edwards, pp. 151‚Äì2.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 267‚Äì8, 271‚Äì3, 281, 283. On 25 April the division reached the River Po. This was a formidable obstacle, and 56th (L) Division planned to make an assault crossing that night. In the event the infantry got across by storm boat in the afternoon to occupy Crespino, and the river assault after nightfall was almost unopposed.Edwards, p. 152.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 295, 319. The division pushed on to the Adige, where it crossed near Rovigo. 56th (London) Division and 2nd New Zealand Division were given the task of capturing Venice, which they did on 28 April after a brief action. The war in Italy ended on 2 May with the Surrender of Caserta.Edwards, pp. 152‚Äì3.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 324, 326, 332. =3rd Air Formation Signals= 2nd (London) Motor Divisional Signals was detached from its division at the end of 1939 and reorganised as 3rd Army Signals. After Dunkirk it was redesignated No 2 Headquarters Signals, then again in October 1940 as 3rd Air Formation Signals. Since 1938 the Royal Corps of Signals had provided land communications for Royal Air Force (RAF) HQs overseas through Air Formation Signals (AFS) units.Lord & Watson, p. 310. 3rd Air Formation Signals HQ was sent to Middle East Forces at the end of 1940, to be built up to strength by absorbing small units already serving with No 204 Group and other RAF HQs. It left a large cadre in England to reform 47th Divisional Signals (see below). With the proliferation of RAF HQs in the Middle East, 4th Air Formation Signals was formed in July from Nos 2 and 3 Companies of 3rd AFS. Of these No 2 had been raised in October 1940 and was operating in Cyrenaica, while No 3 had recently returned from the Greek Campaign. 4th AFS was later absorbed into the North Somerset Yeomanry.Nalder, pp. 318, 629. No 204 Group was expanded into the Western Desert Air Force in October 1941. This had to be mobile to cooperate with Eighth Army's forthcoming offensive (Operation Crusader): the two fighter wing HQs could leapfrog forwards, and they were split into several flying wings, each with its own landing ground (LG). Three LGs linked by land-line to their parent wing HQ formed a 'fighter airfields area'. As the army and air force advanced, new LGs could be rapidly established, the earlier LGs being taken over by bomber squadrons. All this imposed a heavy burden on the AFS units maintaining communications as the Western Desert Campaign ebbed and flowed in advance and retreat. In 1942, 4th (NSY) AFS was allocated to the Desert Air Force, leaving 3rd AFS to concentrate on 'area' tasks for other RAF HQs in Egypt and the Middle East.Playfair, Vol III, pp. 12‚Äì3. In 1943 a standardisation committee regularised the various HQ signal units, and AFS units were supposed to adopt the following organisation:Lord & Watson, p. 265. * 2 Line Troops * 2 Construction Troops * 2 Terminal Equipment Troops * 3 Telegraph Operating Troops * 2 Despatch Rider Troops (in the Western Desert light trucks frequently replaced DR motorcyclesNalder, p. 297.) * 1 Technical Maintenance Troop * 5 Wing Troops After the Second Battle of Alamein, followed by Eighth Army's advance into Tunisia and subsequently to Italy, 3rd AFS continued to serve in the Middle East. It was disbanded in September 1945. =47th (London) Divisional Signals= 47th (London) Division's formation sign, referencing Bow Bells. 2nd (London) Motor Division dropped the 'Motor' part of its title in June 1940 and was renamed 47th (London) Division on 21 November.Joslen, pp. 41‚Äì2. 47th (London) Divisional Signals was reformed from the cadre left behind when 3rd Air Formation Signals went to the Middle East. The division was in reserve behind the anti-invasion formations along the South Coast of England, with winter quarters in Hampshire and Sussex.Edwards, pp. 180‚Äì4Collier, Map 20. In December 1941 the division was placed on a lower establishment, though still with an operational role in Home Forces. In January 1944 it moved from Hampshire and Dorset District to Northern Command, returning to Southern Command between March and July. After D Day (6 June) reserve units and formations in the UK were required to send large drafts to reinforce 21st Army Group fighting in Normandy. On 15 August 1944 what remained of 47th (L) Division began to disperse: divisional signals was disbanded on 18 August. Postwar 56th (London) Armoured Divisional sign 1948‚Äì51. When the Territorial Army was reconstituted in 1947, 56th (London) Division became an armoured division, with the requisite signal regiment (as Royal Corps of Signals units were now termed) provided by the City of London Signals. 56th (London) Armoured Divisional Signal Regiment (City of London Signals) was based along with the divisional HQ in Chelsea, London. In 1956 the division was reconverted into an infantry division, with consequent reorganisation and redesignation of the signal regiment. During this period a divisional signal regiment was organised as follows:Lord & Watson, pp. 202‚Äì5, 280‚Äì1. St Paul's sword. * Regimental HQ * Light Aid Detachment, Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers * Communications Section Troop * HQ Squadron ** Squadron HQ ** Q Troop (quartermasters) ** S Troop (stores) ** M Troop (technical maintenance) * 1 Squadron ** SHQ ** C Troop (lines) ** O Troop (signal centre) ** R Troop (radio relay) * 2 Squadron ** SHQ ** A Troop (radio) (Divisional Main HQ) ** B Troop (radio) (Divisional Rear HQ) In addition, each brigade within the division had its own dedicated signal squadron providing Troops to the armoured and artillery regiments and rear link detachments to infantry battalions. In 1961 the division was disbanded and 56th (London) Signal Regiment was reduced to 332 Signal Squadron (from 167 Infantry Brigade Signals at Balham). The squadron was assigned to 54 (East Anglian) Signal Regiment, but was disbanded when the Territorial Army was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967.Lord & Watson, pp. 166, 205. In 1947 London District Signals was reduced to a mixed squadron ('mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit) and in 1949 to a troop, but in 1952 it was reformed as London District Signal Regiment in the Army Emergency Reserve (the successors of the Supplementary Reserve). In 1959 it was redesignated 87 Signal Regiment (District) and in 1961 was merged into 80 Signal Regiment. This regiment, which had the Communications Zone role, was itself disbanded in 1967.Lord & Watson, pp. 211‚Äì2.Nalder, pp. 474, 478. In 1977 the City of London Signals' traditional number was revived when two troops of 44 (Cinque Ports) Signal Squadron, 858 (Corps) Signal Troop at Eastbourne and 859 Signal Troop from Ilford (which then moved to Sandgate, near Folkestone) were combined to form 56 Signal Squadron under 36 (Eastern) Signal Regiment. Both troops had the role of reinforcing the Regular 22 Signal Regiment at Lippstadt in Germany as part of British Army of the Rhine. In 1982 this role was expanded to reinforcing 2 Infantry Division HQ and Signal Regiment; later it was re-roled as a theatre reserve squadron for British Army of the Rhine Command Communications. In 1990 56 Signal Squadron became independent and then in 1992 it reorganised as a National Communications Squadron and concentrated at Eastbourne. The squadron lost its independent status when it was regimented with 31 (City of London) Signal Regiment in November 1995.Lord & Watson, pp. 137, 208. By 2013 it was part of 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment but it disbanded by April 2016 under the Army 2020 plans; the Eastbourne Army Reserve centre taken was over by 3rd Battalion Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment with the signals personnel given the option to re-role as infantry.Army 2020 Reserve Structure and Basing.

Two chronicles, possibly by the same author,Keith Brown, 'A House Divided: Family and Feud in Carrick', The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 75, no. 200, Part 2 (October 1996), pp. 168-196 at p. 169 fn. 6. state that James VI of Scotland arranged this marriage for Kennedy to a bride without a dowry to punish the family because Thomas Kennedy laird of Bargany had taken part in a riot in Edinburgh on 17 November 1596.A chronicle of the kings of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 156: Robert Pitcairn, Historical and genealogical account of the principal families of the name of Kennedy (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 24. The laird had appeared with others in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh and made a religious protest. The incident was regarded as a conflict between the gentlemen of the king's household known as 'cubiculars' and the financial officers called the 'Octavians'.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. v (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 349, 362-3. As the chronicles mention, after this disturbance Lord Lindsay of the Byres' property was forfeit, and Bargany was punished by a marriage that was to \\"the wreck of his house\\".Register of the Privy Council, vol. v (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 359: Keith Brown, 'A House Divided: Family and Feud in Carrick', The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 75, no. 200, Part 2 (October 1996), pp. 168-196 at p. 178. What is known about the marriage contract and settlement appears to contradict the story found in the chronicles. James VI bought the bride clothes and paid for food and musicians at the wedding in Edinburgh.Letters to King James the Sixth from the Queen, Prince Henry, Prince Charles, The Princess Elizabeth (Edinburgh, 1835), pp. lxxi-lxxii: Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 148. Anne of Denmark first tried to obtain Lord Lindsay's forfeit as a dowry for Jean Stewart.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 425. Then she arranged a loan for the dowry, asking Sir William Stewart of Traquair, Jean Stewart's brother-in-law who had protected the king on the day of the riot, to be a cautioner for the money. In 1615 the dowry or \\"tochter\\" money was still unpaid, and their son claimed the sum from Sir John Stuart of Traquair and his legal tutor Robert Stuart. In April 1615 the Privy Council of Scotland wrote to King James that Traquair ought not to be liable because Sir William had been following the queen's direction \\"whose commandment was ever unto him a law\\". The Privy Council noted that the king and queen were also cautioners and \\"personallie bound in the contract\\". In May, Anne of Denmark asked her lady-in-waiting Jean Ker, Countess of Roxburghe to write to her husband to intercede with James to the same effect, to pay what Traquair owed for the dowry.The Melros Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 205-6; Jean Drummond's letter is in the National Library of Scotland Adv MS 31.1.1 vol. 6/35. Thomas Kennedy of Bargany died on 7 November 1597 and Gilbert Kennedy became the laird of Bargany and Ardstinchar.Keith Brown, 'A House Divided: Family and Feud in Carrick', The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 75, no. 200, Part 2 (October 1996), pp. 168-196 at p. 180. Jean Stewart became known as \\"Lady Bargany\\". James VI settled the barony of Bargany on Thomas Kennedy and Jean Stewart on 12 August 1597.National Records of Scotland, Register of the Privy Seal, PS1/69 ff.182-3. They had a son Thomas and two daughters who died young. Kennedy feud Bargany was drawn into the long standing family feud with John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis. On 3 January 1598 Thomas Kennedy of Culzean, called the Tutor of Cassilis, shot pistols at Bargany's servants Alexander Kennedy and David Mure and others at Maybole and pursuing them the next day at the Place of Auchendrane. The Tutor claimed that Alexander Kennedy had been insinuated into his household, and he had been ambushed in Maybole.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 441, 442-3. Although Bargany had helped the earl at Inch Castle, on 11 December 1601 he met the earl and his followers at Pennyglen near Maybole and was killed with a lance thrust in his back.Keith Brown, 'A House Divided: Family and Feud in Carrick', The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 75, no. 200, Part 2 (October 1996), pp. 168-196 at p. 184. The Earl claimed in his defence to the Privy Council that Bargany's party that day included men denounced by the king as rebels that he had a commission to pursue with fire and sword. The lawyer Thomas Hamilton challenged this defence, but Cassilis and followers (all named) were found not guilty.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1884), pp. 347-350. Jean Stewart Lady Bargany was required to deliver her houses of Ardstinchar, Bargany, Newark, and her house in Ayr to the king's herald in 1603. She continued the feud by legal means, but also received several royal gifts by privy seal letter.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1884), pp. 454, 578-9, 793, 790. Death Jean Stewart fell ill from some sort of fever and went to see the queen's physician Martin Sch√∂ner at court in London, but he gave her no hope and she died at Stilton on her way back to Scotland on 16 August 1605.Robert Pitcairn, Historical and Genealogical Account of the Principal Families of the Name of Kennedy (Edinburgh, 1830), pp. 67-86. Jean Stewart was buried with her husband in the new burial aisle she had built at Ballantrae close to Ardstinchar Castle.Andrew Spicer, \\"Burial and the Development of Aisles in Post Reformation Scotland\\", in Bruce Gordon & Peter Marshall, The Place of the Dead (Cambridge, 2000), p. 166. The monument has been discussed in connection with the architecture of Anna of Denmark and David Cunningham of Robertland.Aonghus MacKechnie, 'Sir David Cunningham of Robertland: Murderer and 'Magna Britannia's' First Architect', Architectural History, vol. 52 (2009), pp. 79‚Äì115 at p. 91. It has been suggested the monument may be the work of the master mason David Scoughall.'THE SCHAW MONUMENT', Church Monuments Society. The will of Lady Bargany The will of Jean Stewart gives an insight the clothes worn by a Scottish courtier, some of which were gifts from the queen, the furnishings she owned at Ardstinchar and Bargany, and her farmstock including the four English milk cows at Bargany, her coach horses and six nags. Personal jewelry included three gold chains, three pairs of gold bracelets, a gold belt, two gold hangers of brooches, two small jewels set with diamonds and rubies, two pairs of gold garnishings (back and fore, to wear in her hair), eight knops and finger rings, a pearl \\"shadow\\". Among the silverware there was a little silver gilt mazer or quaich. Her wardrobe included six gowns, with their doublets, skirts and vasquines, each valued at ¬£76-13s-4d. Scots, five cloaks of silk, velvet grosgam, and taffeta at ¬£40 each, a gown of green figured velvet, four \\"stands\\" of velvet clothes that had belonged to Gilbert Kennedy, more cloaks, red, blue, and yellow taffeta bed courtains, a scarlet embroidered \\"pinnacle\\", black figured taffeta bed curtains, red and white embroidered curtains with a red velvet \\"pinnacle\\", green damask bed curtains, gray, blue, green curtains and a scarlet canopy, red stemming, red grosgram, and tartan curtains, tablecloths, pots, pans, spits and racks, and other household goods. There were two \\"hagbuts\\" or muskets and six small \\"iron pieces\\" or pistols. The executor of the will was Josias Stewart of Bonytoun, sometime friend of Hercules Stewart.James Paterson, History of the County of Ayr, vol. 1 (Ayr, 1847), p. 380-2: Will '1620 Stewart, Jean', NRS ECC9/7/17 pp. 227-232. Thomas Kennedy of Bargany and Margaret Stewart Their son, Thomas Kennedy of Bargany married his cousin Margaret Stewart, the daughter of Jean Stewart, Lady Bargany's brother Josias Stewart of Bonytoun, who had been the executor of Jean's will and his legal tutor. Margaret Stewart left him in 1619, complaining of his lack of respect to her and her father. On 6 October 1619 after her usual morning prayers at Bargany Castle, she was walking in the garden with her psalm book in her hands, and was surprised by her husband's servant Patrick Kennedy, who asked where she had been. Patrick complained to Thomas about her answer and said she called him \\"his tutor\\". This enraged Thomas who found her in the gardener's house and he punched and kicked her. Although the gardener Thomas Todie intervened as she tried to escape Thomas caught up with her again and dragged her by the hair back towards Bargany House (the distance of three archery butts), and up a narrow stair to the gallery, banging her head against the sides. Thomas left her unconscious on the gallery floor and locked her alone in the castle. Margaret found her way out of the back door and escaped through the hedge and waded through the deep water of the Girvan, hiding in the woods and reaching the safety of her aunt's house at Dailly the next day. Then she rode to Ardstinchar Castle hoping to find her father but had to stay in a barn until Lord Ochiltree arrived. She came to Edinburgh where her father and John Jolie, doctor of physic looked after her. Meanwhile, in November Thomas was at Ballintrae and played golf on the links called the Green of Ardstinchar with his friends. The Privy Council of Scotland upheld her complaint.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1895), pp. 144, 147-8, 227-9, 236, 347.

Biography  After secondary school in Hadera, Moshe Yaniv studied chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1956-1961) and obtained a \\"Master of Sciences\\" in organic chemistry. He joined Professor Fran√ßois Gros' laboratory at the Institute of Physico-chemical Biology to prepare a state thesis in science (1969) on the mechanisms of protein synthesis and the structure of tRNAs. During his thesis he spent six months in Frederick Sanger's laboratory at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge England, to establish the sequence of several tRNAs and contributed to the establishment of the three-dimensional structure of the tRNA. At the end of his thesis he then joined Professor Paul Berg's laboratory at Stanford University in California for a postdoctoral fellowship continuing his work on the structure and functions of tRNAs. Back in France in 1972, he joined the Institut Pasteur as team leader and then as head of the Oncogenic Virus Unit (1975).

Armstrong, was a British botanical fern artist who lived and worked in New Zealand and Australia. She compiled and artistically arranged fern specimens for a number of Australasia's ferns albums, including a series of professional gift books \\"The South Pacific Fern Album\\". Armstrong participated in a number of international and intercolonial exhibitions, where her ferns received commendation and were gifted to dignitaries.  Life  Armstrong was born in a family of William and Margaret Newey of Birmingham, England. When her mother died, in 1853, she emigrated with her father, brothers and stepsisters to Victoria. In 1858, she married Charles Clark Armstrong, a coach runner and storekeeper who was also a native of Birmingham, and in early 1860s the couple with their two sons relocated to New Zealand. They resided in Dunedin, New Zealand, for next two decades, where their remaining eleven children were born. In 1887 Armstrong and her husband moved to Melbourne, while their older son Charles Clark, Jr. remained in Dunedin. After the sudden death of their daughter, Nellie, Mary Ann and her husband travelled to West Australia to care for their grandchildren. They eventually returned to the Melbourne area and settled with the family of their daughter Jennie. Mary Ann died in Flemington on 2 July 1910 and is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery.  Art  Armstrong developed a keen interest in collecting and arranging fern specimens, being active from roughly the late 1870s to the 1890s. She artistically arranged and scientifically notated ferns in albums and framed some of the compositions into decorative, collage-like landscapes. Her ornamental and handcrafted fern work reflects the domestic tradition of 19th century women's decorative arts, however unlike others examples of feminine tradition, Armstrong's botanical art was displayed at a series of international and intercolonial exhibitions between 1879 and 1889. She used botanical watercolors, miniature painting and needlework, as well as natural objects such as ferns, seaweeds, shells and seed for arranging her compositions. Another distinctive feature of Armstrong's works is their commercial success among the general public generated by the reputation she established through her commendable exhibition record. Her commercial fern work also capitalised on the popular appeal of the fern as a tourist icon and national symbol. In the mid-to-late 1880s Mary Ann's fern albums entitled New Zealand Fern existed in public institutions and private collections. Her later South Pacific Fern Album (1889) represents the culmination of her career blending its botanical, aesthetic, and commercial aspects together with the burgeoning discourses of tourism and nationalism. In addition to albums, Armstrong produced ferns mounted on postcards and paper goods with fern transfers selling them to local booksellers and fancy goods shops. Nowadays Armstrong's albums can be found such institutions as the National Library of New Zealand, the Universities of Wellington and Waikato, Australian National University Library, the National Library of Australia, and the State Libraries of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as at Harvard, the University of Georgia and UCLA.

Bradley was two or three years old when he was enslaved and transported to the United States, where he was purchased by a Mr. Bradley of Pendleton County, Kentucky; he subsequently moved with the Bradley family to the Arkansas Territory. While working days as a slave, Bradley began to work for himself through the night. In 1833, after eight years, he purchased his freedom and went to Cincinnati in the free state of Ohio. Bradley associated himself with Lane Theological Seminary and played a central role in the Lane Debates on Slavery in 1834. As the result of Bradley's moving speech, students rallied to organize educational opportunities for blacks and sought to integrate with the community. The Board of Trustees of the Seminary then shut down anti-slavery activity, which resulted in at least forty people leaving the seminary, including the Lane Rebels. Oberlin, Ohio became a racially diverse community and a center for anti-slavery efforts when the Lane Rebels transferred from Lane to Oberlin College. With the Lane Rebels, Bradley left the seminary and moved to Oberlin, Ohio. He studied for a year in an affiliated preparatory school of Oberlin College, the Sheffield Manual Labor Institute. Bradley wrote an autobiographical statement that provides much of information that is known about his time of slavery and escape. Nothing is known of his life after 1837. There is no known image of or physical description of him.  Slavery  =Childhood= According to Bradley, he lived in Guinea, a region of west Africa, when he was captured as a two or three year old child. He later said of the experience, \\"the soul-destroyers tore me from my mother's arms.\\" He was taken on a long overland journey before being put on board a ship bound for America. The ship was full of chained adult African men and women, but he was allowed free run of the deck because he was too small to be chained. He was brought to America illegally, since the legal importation of slaves ended in 1808. The Old Slave Mart, Charleston, South Carolina After his arrival at the port of Charleston, South Carolina, he was purchased by a slaveholder, brought to Pendleton County, Kentucky and sold about six months later to a man named Bradley, from whom he took his name. He was enslaved with Mr. Bradley's family in Pendleton County. Although Bradley wrote that his owner was considered a kind master because he was not beaten and had enough to eat, Bradley stated that he was kicked and thrown around as a young child. When he was nine years old, he was hit so hard that he was knocked unconscious for a time and his owner thought he had killed him. As a fifteen-year-old, he became very sick due to overwork, which made his owner angry. In addition, the Bradley children made threatening gestures at times with knives and axes. He worked very hard, starting work at sunrise and not finishing until it was dark. From the time he was fourteen years old, he thought incessantly about how to obtain his freedom. He taught himself to read easy words and to spell whenever he could from a spelling book that he acquired and kept in his hat. He convinced one of the owner's sons to teach him to write. His mistress found out about it on the second night of instruction. She chastised her son, telling him that if he could write, he could write a pass to help him escape. Bradley practiced on his own after that. He moved with the Bradley family to Arkansas shortly after he turned fifteen. They lived near the Choctaw mission and Fort Towson in modern Oklahoma, which was then in the Arkansas Territory. After Mr. Bradley died, his widow had young James running her plantation. =Plan to purchase his freedom= One of the lessons that he learned as an enslaved person was to always deny any interest in desiring freedom, because he knew it would result in rough treatment. But, obtaining freedom was a strong, heart-breaking desire. He developed a plan to buy his freedom. He worked all day, got a few hours of sleep, and then while others slept, he pursued several endeavors to make money. He started by using corn husks to weave collars for horses. He found a balance between maximizing how much time he was able to work at night and getting enough sleep that he was not too weak to work during the day. After eight years, he was able to purchase his freedom in 1833 for $700 (). He had another $200 () to start his new life. Freedom Upon achieving his freedom, he headed for a free state. He visited for a time in Northern Kentucky and went to Covington, Kentucky, where he crossed the Ohio River that divided the slave states and the free states. He arrived at Cincinnati, Ohio.  Education and anti-slavery efforts  =Lane Seminary= Desiring to become a minister, Bradley was admitted to Lane Seminary on May 28, 1833. The first African-American student at Lane, he said that he was not treated differently because of the color of his skin. Lyman Beecher, the president of Lane, had instructed students at the seminary to be careful in the way that they interacted with black people. There were some students who did not believe in abolition of slavery, so when Lyman Beecher invited students to his home, Bradley felt it wiser not to attend. Beecher did not understand it was not enough to model careful behavior; he thought that Bradley did not come to the event because he was timid. Lane Theological Seminary , Cincinnati, Ohio While at Lane, Bradley was the institute's coordinator for rescuing slaves in their quest to be free. He helped them cross the Ohio River and make their way towards Ontario, Canada. In 1834, his testimonial was printed in The Oasis, an annual edited by Lydia Maria Child. =Lane Seminary debates= Theodore Dwight Weld, leader of the Lane Rebels. William Garrison, publisher the anti- slavery newspaper, The Liberator, published a book in 1832 that offered Thoughts on African Colonization, Or, An Impartial Exhibition of the Doctrines, Principles and Purposes of the American Colonization Society. In both, he attacks the American Colonization Society and its intended strategy to send free blacks to Africa. Garrison said the Society was \\"pernicious, cruel, and delusive\\". At the time, most white Americans believed that whites and blacks could not live together as equals. They thought that it would be better to establish colonies in Africa for former slaves and convey them to the colonies on ships. Liberia was created by those believing in colonization for repatriated slaves. On the other hand, abolitionists saw slavery as morally wrong and that slaves should be emancipated as soon as possible. Theodore Dwight Weld, an abolitionist and former student at the Oneida Institute, near Utica, New York, led debates at Oneida in 1833. Weld arrived at Lane Seminary and became the leader of the school's student body. He helped organize a debate about slavery and trained people to deliver \\"spirited\\" speeches. The debate represented the views of the abolitionists who were against slavery and believed in emancipation against others who thought that slaves should be sent to a colony in Africa. Harriet Beecher (Stowe), the daughter of Lane's president Lyman Beecher, was among the those in attendance, according to historian Gilbert Barnes. Bradley, who supported abolition of slavery, participated in the debates, and he was the only black person to speak. Some Southern students brought their slaves to the debates, but none of them were asked to comment. It is remarkable that not only would he speak, but people listened to him. He described what it was like to be a slave and brought his audience to tears when he described being on the slave ship. He stressed the need for equality, education, and freedom for all. Bradley's classmate, Henry B. Stanton (future husband of Elizabeth Cady Stanton), remarked that Bradley had thoroughly, intelligently, and thoughtfully addressed all the issues that are raised against immediate emancipation, such as \\"it would be unsafe to the community\\" or that \\"the condition of the emancipated negroes would be worse than it now is ‚Äî that they are incompetent to provide for themselves ‚Äî that they would become paupers and vagrants, and would rather steal than work for wages.\\" Bradley also integrated humor in his speech. Both abolitionists and those who argued for colonization listened intently to the discussion, and a number of times the entire audience would respond with laughter. He made it clear that there was an innate desire of slaves to take care of themselves and others and what they most desired was freedom and education. Attendees found his speech to be very emotional and the most important one of the debates. The event was more like a revival than a debate, according to historian Donald M. Scott. By the end of the speech many students were radicalized against slavery and students voted that they supported an end to slavery‚Äîimmediately. The Colonization Society was voted out of existence. Some students formed an anti-slavery group, organized their efforts to establish a library, conducted Bible classes, and opened free schools in black neighborhoods. The classes became so full that potential students were turned away. At that time, one third of the state's blacks lived in Cincinnati. Bradley became a manager of the newly formed student anti- slavery society. Some of the members of the anti-slavery group went to New York to speak to the American Anti-Slavery Society about the debates and the resulting activities. Weld and the Lane Rebels integrated themselves within the black community, by renting rooms from boarding houses, attending weddings and funerals, and going to Prayer Meetings. Local leaders and most of the trustees had Southern clients, and were concerned that their businesses would be affected as the result of the students' efforts. Many complained to Lane Seminary, while Beecher was out of town. The Board of Trustees put a stop to any anti-slavery efforts, condemned the debates, and issued a gag order against discussion of slavery. This caused many students, particularly those affiliated with Weld, to leave the school. They went to Oberlin College, making that school and town racially diverse and a center for leadership of the abolitionist movement. = Sheffield Manual Labor Institute = Bradley went with the other Lane Rebels to Oberlin Collegiate Institute (later Oberlin College) in 1835. He enrolled in 1836 in a satellite school Oberlin set up to handle the great influx of students: the Sheffield Manual Labor Institute, in Sheffield, Ohio, northeast of Oberlin. Sheffield had a high school level curriculum combined with manual labor. There was a plan to raise silkworms to create silk. The plan was not successful and the school closed after a year, in part because it refused to be a segregated school as required by recent Ohio legislation. Unfortunately, nothing is known about Bradley's life after 1837. The final reference to him is in a letter that year of another Lane Rebel, C. Stewart Renshaw, who refers to him as \\"our dear brother\\". He may be the \\"negro, late of Sheffield College\\", who helped in the liberation of fourteen slaves from one plantation.  Legacy  Bradley's speech was an example of the power of including people who are directly involved in a situation to speak to their issues and desires. It is generally people who have power‚Äîdue to education, their profession, or wealth‚Äîthat speak to social issues and potential solutions. Bradley showed that people who are directly involved should be part of the discourse. The controversy surrounding the debates‚Äîdue to Bradley's effectiveness as a speaker‚Äî\\"gave voice\\" to the anti- slavery movement, particularly as Weld and about 40 other Lane Rebels moved to Oberlin and the college became a leader in the abolitionist movement. Students at other colleges and universities initiated discussions about free speech at their campuses.  Statue and plaque  A statue of Bradley was erected in 1988 by the Greater Cincinnati Bicentennial Commission in Covington, Kentucky at roughly the place that Bradley crossed the Ohio River to Cincinnati. The statue, made by George Danhires, shows Bradley sitting on a riverfront bench, facing north across the Ohio River to Cincinnati, while reading a book. It was voted one of the top five interesting statues in the greater Cincinnati area in 2014. In 2016, the statue was restored.  Media portrayal  Bradley appears as a character in the 2019 movie Sons & Daughters of Thunder, about the Lane Debates, based on a play by Earlene Hawley and Curtis Heeter.

Linlithgow Parish Church - St Michael's Greenside Church, Edinburgh 17 Brunswick Street, Edinburgh (left) Stt George's Church in Edinburgh- now known as West Register House The grave of the Very Rev Archibald Scott, Dean Cemetery Life He was born on 18 September 1837 at Bogton Farm near Cadder, north of Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, the sixth son of Margaret (n√©e Brown) and James Scott, a farmer. He was educated at the parish school which was run by the Church of Scotland. His later education was at Glasgow High School. His classmates included James Bryce. From 1845 onwards the Church of Scotland required trainee ministers to study for four years for a general MA degree prior to studying divinity. Scott studied for his general degree at the University of Glasgow, at that time located on the High Street close to Glasgow Cathedral. His studied mathematics under William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, Greek was under Edmund Lushington, and Latin from Professor Ramsay. Lacking skills in mathematics and physics he graduated with a BA rather than MA. In autumn 1855 he began studying divinity at the University of Glasgow. He studied theology under Professor Hill. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Glasgow in June 1859. He began as assistant to Rev Dr Archibald Watson of St Matthew's Church in Glasgow. In the autumn of 1859 he moved to Clackmannan as assistant to Rev Peter Balfour (known as \\"Perpendicular Peter\\") the father of John Balfour. Here he started a lifelong friendship with John. He also befriended the young Alexander Bruce during this period. In January 1860 he was ordained as first minister of the East Church in Perth (St John's, close to the River Tay) replacing Rev Elder Cumming. Scott was only 22 years old at this time. He left this major city church in 1863 to move to the much smaller parish church in Abernethy, in place of Rev David Duncan, under the patronage of the Earl of Mansfield. Although the Church of Scotland had major competition in Abernethy in the form of the Free Church and United Presbyterian Church, Scott nevertheless persuaded the Church of Scotland to fund a new manse for his use during what was to be his brief tenure. Meanwhile in Glasgow a group of businessmen (including Sir John Maxwell of Pollok, in discussion with Rev Matthew Leishman of Govan Old Parish Church, were planning a new church to serve the Kinning Park district of Glasgow, as a Quoad sacra church. It was deducted that Archibald Scott would be a good choice as minister, and in 1864 he came, at first to a temporary wooden structure, and then to the newly built church (1867) was known as the Maxwell Church after its main funder, and by then deceased, Lord Maxwell. Soon after construction, and Rev John Cunningham's critical \\"Crieff Organ Case\\" was decided in court, Scott organised the insertion of a church organ (not previously encouraged by the Church of Scotland).Children of the Fasti by Brian Orr He remained in Glasgow at the Maxwell Church for four years. In July 1869 he was translated to Linlithgow Parish Church (St Michael's) in West Lothian. This imposing church stands next to Linlithgow Palace. He did not take up the post until September 1870. Here he succeeded his friend, Rev Donald Macleod who later was also his immediate predecessor as Moderator (1895). But again his stay was short-lived, he was chosen to replace the late Rev Dr William Glover (1801-1871) of Greenside Church in Edinburgh in September 1871.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1870 Greenside was not a huge church, but had an important and influential catchment in the residents of Calton Hill: Royal Terrace and Regent Terrace. Scott at this time lived at 17 Brunswick Street, just north of Greenside Church.Edinburgh Post Office directory 1873 This imposing Georgian townhouse was designed by William Henry Playfair.Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh by Gifford, McWilliam and Walker His parish and congregation were growing rapidly due to new housing projects on Leith Walk, Easter Road and London Road. Scott set about raising funds for a new church, Holyrood Abbey Church to be sited to the east (eventually built at the junction of London Road and Marionville Road in 1899). Amongst his congregation and Kirk Session was the aged Andrew Young (who ran the Sunday School and Charles John Pearson. During this period (from 1873) he was appointed one of the trustees to the Baird Trust: overseeing the wise use of the immense ¬£500,000 left by James Baird to promote good works on behalf of the Church of Scotland (this equates to ¬£10 million in modern terms). In 1876 the University of Glasgow awarded him an honorary doctorate (DD). Following the Education (Scotland) Act 1872, Scott was elected onto the First Edinburgh School Board. Scott emphasised that a good primary education was futile if a person did not then continue to read. He was Chairman of the Edinburgh School Board from 1878 to 1882. In 1880 he replaced Rev Robert Horne Stevenson (who resigned in June 1879) as minister of St George's Church on Charlotte Square in Edinburgh's New Town. He was then living at 7 Rothesay Place.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1881 St George's had an even more impressive and affluent congregation than Greenside: incorporating the residents of Charlotte Square, the Moray Estate, Edinburgh's West End and the First New Town. His Kirk Session at St George's included Thomas Graham Murray, Sir John Cheyne, his brother Harry Cheyne (Session Clerk) and James McKerrell Brown. In 1890 he was living at 16 Rothesay Place, west of the church.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1891 In 1896 he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly, the highest position in the Church of Scotland. He was succeeded in 1897 by Very Rev William Mair. He spent from 1895 to 1900 striving to re-unify the Church of Scotland with the Free Church. This was largely successful with the merge taking place in 1900. However, his later years were overshadowed by the multiple court cases regarding the ownership issues of the churches themselves, mainly caused by the fact that the merge, though substantial, was not complete, and the Free Church continued as a body. In many parishes the caused the requirement to build another church. This huge cost, within a limited time-frame, almost bankrupted the church. Moreover, due to undue optimism, almost all churches were created of a size capable of holding the entire congregation of the parish. This resulted in most of the new churches being less than half full. The entire affair broke Scott's spirit.ODNB: Archibald Scott He was replaced at St Georges by Rev Gavin Lang Pagan (later killed serving as a Chaplain in WW1 at the Battle of Arras (1917)).CWGC: Gavin Pagan He was in poor health from January 1909 and died in North Berwick on 18 April 1909. He was buried in Dean Cemetery in west Edinburgh. The grave faces north onto the northmost path in the original cemetery. The Maxwell Church was demolished in 1976. Family On 4 June 1861 he married Isabella Greig (d.1892), daughter of Robert Greig, a merchant in Perth. Of their six children two survived to adulthood: Robert Greig Scott WS (1878-1911) and Margaret Scott.

With her husband Ron Taylor, they made shark documentaries and filmed sequences for films such as Jaws (1975).  Early life  Born in Paddington, Sydney on 9 November 1935, Taylor spent her early years in Sydney. Her mother was a housewife and her father an engineer for Exide Batteries. The family moved to New Zealand in 1939 to set up a battery factory there, but were unable to return to Australia when WWII broke out. At 12 years of age Taylor contracted polio during the 1948 polio epidemic. Isolated from her family, friends and schooling she slowly recovered with the support of the ‚ÄòSister Kenny Treatment and Rehabilitation Method‚Äô. Taylor fell behind in her studies and left school at 15 years of age to work for the NZ Film Unit drawing for an animation studio. Taylor turned to Sydney with her family to settle in the beach side suburb of Port Hacking where she started diving in 1956 and took up spearfishing in 1960 to provide food for the family. She became an Australian champion scuba and spearfisher and met her future husband, Ron Taylor, at the St George's Spearfishing Club. They married in December 1963.Kennett, Joan; 'Underwater Romance', The Australian Women's Weekly, Wednesday 5 February 1964, pages 2 and 3, , retrieved 24 September 2012.  Career  Although starting their aquatic careers as competitive spearfishers, they downed their spears in favour of cameras and began making marine documentaries. The Taylors' introduced Australia and the world to the wonders of marine life and particularly sharks. She and Ron were the first people to film Great White sharks without the protection of a cage. They made countless shark films including Blue Water, White Death where they swam cageless among a school of Oceanic White Tip sharks feeding on a whale carcass. The documentary was a cinema hit and caught the attention of American film director Steven Spielberg. They were called on to shoot the real Great White Shark sequences for Jaws. In addition to the thousands of hours of film and television and their various published works, the Taylors performed conservation work in Australia and around the world. In 1967 a Belgian scientific expedition asked the Taylors' to join their endeavour to record life on the Great Barrier Reef. Over several months, Valerie dove the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef from Lady Elliot Island up to the Torres Strait ‚Äì a feat perhaps unsurpassed even today. Over the decades, Taylor's conservation efforts included campaigning to prevent oil exploration in Ningaloo Marine Park, overturning mining rights on Coral Sea Islands, winning protection for many places on the Great Barrier Reef before it was given World Heritage status, and lobbying for marine sanctuary zones in South Australia. Taylor also excelled as an underwater photographer and her underwater images graced the pages of the National Geographic Magazine including some pioneering macro images of coral and invertebrates on the Great Barrier Reef that made front cover in 1973. This compelling front page image also caught the attention of Lars-Eric Lindblad, and Valerie and Ron spent a decade traveling the world on the little red and white ship called the Lindblad Explorer lecturing to travellers on board. During the early 1980s Taylor began experiments with sharks wearing a steel mesh suit. Her experiments were ground-breaking, world firsts that contributed to a new understanding of the relative bite power of various shark species. The 1981 front cover of National Geographic magazine featured Taylor, off the coast of California, during one of these experiments with Blue sharks wearing this chainmail suit. In 1981 Taylor was awarded the NOGI award for Arts, Academy of Underwater Arts & Sciences, presented by the Academy of Underwater Arts and Sciences (AUAS) to diving luminaries. In 1986, Taylor was appointed by his Royal Highness Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, the ‚ÄòRider of the Order of the Golden Ark‚Äô for marine conservation. She was recognised for her successful efforts protecting of the habitat of the potato cod near Lizard Island ‚Äì the first gazetted protection of the Great Barrier Reef. She was awarded the 1997 American Nature Photographer of the year award for a picture of a whale shark swimming with her nephew in Ningaloo Marine Park. By 2000 she was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame. At 66 years old she was still diving with sharks and was awarded the Centenary Medal for service to Australian society in marine conservation and the Australian Senior Achiever of the Year. In 2008 Taylor received the Australian Geographic Lifetime of Conservation award. In 2010 Taylor was awarded an AM For service to conservation and the environment as an advocate for the protection and preservation of marine wildlife and habitats, particularly the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo Reef, and as an underwater cinematographer and photographer. Taylor's husband Ron passed away from leukemia in 2012, but Taylor has continued her focus on marine conservation and communication and has implored governments, business and the public of the importance of the conservation of our oceans and their inhabitants. She has illustrated and written a children's book, campaigned against ocean plastic pollution overfishing and published her memoirs .

Headquarters of the Basque Summer University. The Basque Summer University (in Basque and officially: Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea, _UEU_ ) is a university institution created in 1973, which offers university courses in collaboration with the University of the Basque Country, Mondragon University, Public University of Navarra, the University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour in Bayonne, and Basque wikipedia. The UEU has its headquarters in the Palace of Markeskua (Eibar). Although its name is the Basque Summer University (Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea, UEU), the institution offers university courses year-round, not just in the summer. It is currently a non-profit organisation and in 1990 it was recognised as a public utility organisation because it promotes general interest in the field of research, learning, and dissemination, mainly at university level, through the many pedagogical and cultural services it provides.  History  = Background: No university education in Basque until 1972 = After examining the continuing historical regression of the geographical environment where Basque was spoken, the linguist Wilhem von Humboldt predicted in 1809 that this language might disappear in less than a century from the list of living languages. The social, economic, political and cultural processes set in motion by industrialisation and liberalism during the 19th century led to an even greater decline in Basque. As a fact, it suffices to say that Basque remained on the margin of the school, where even its use became forbidden. Among the initiatives that emerged in the 20th century to deal with the risk of the disappearance of Basque are the creation of the Society of Basque Studies and the Royal Academy of the Basque Language (Euskaltzaindia) in 1919 and the creation of Ikastolas (schools in Basque), initially in the 1930s and later in the 1960s. = Background: creation of the unified Basque language in 1968 = Basque, which has 7 main dialects, did not have a standard model of writing until 1968, when Euskaltzaindia laid the foundations of the unified Basque (in Basque batua). Historically, apart from specific and brief exceptions, until then there had never been any training in Basque at university level and in 1972 it was still impossible to study any university degree or even any subject in Basque. = Creation of the UEU in 1973 = In this context, the history of the UEU began in the Basque Weeks organised in Bayonne during the years 1970‚Äì1972. Seeing the success of these days and the discourse given by the mathematician Carlos Santamar√≠a Ansa on the need to create a Basque University, the Euskaldunen Biltzarra, Ikas and Fededunak associations decided to organise summer courses in 1973 with the support of Euskaltzaindia. Similar initiatives that already existed for Catalan and Occitan served as antecedents and references; for example, the Universitat Catalana d'Estiu had been in operation since 1968. Joxe Azurmendi was one of the founders. The first two editions of the UEU (1973 and 1974) were held in St. Jean de Luz and the next two (1975 and 1976) in Ustaritz. = Summer courses in Pamplona (1977‚Äì1999) = In 1977 the summer courses of the UEU moved to Pamplona, becoming year after year the meeting point that allowed the training of teachers and the creation of materials that were incorporated in the offer of new subjects of the official universities. Over the years, it offered between 40 and 50 summer courses each year. For example, in 1995 it offered 45 courses distributed in 26 departments; in total there were 750 teaching hours, in classes, practices, seminars and outings, with more than 650 participants. Annually, UEU published an average of 10 books. The number of teachers and students who worked in Basque at university level in that year would not exceed 4,000 people, and of all of them more than 650 participated in the UEU, this being proof of the success and contribution of these courses, in spite of the limited economic resources it had. = Present situation = Since 1999 these university level courses began to develop not only in summer and in Pamplona, but also throughout the year and in multiple locations. After almost 50 years, thanks to this social process promoted and led by the UEU, it has been possible to take some significant steps in the inclusion of Basque in the university. For example, in 2019 almost all university degrees can also be studied in Basque at one of the universities in the Basque Country; more than 400 books have been published in Basque on 27 university disciplines; congresses are regularly organised in Basque for professionals and academics... The UEU collaborates and offers university courses with the other universities in the Basque Country: the University of the Basque Country, the University of Mondrag√≥n, the University of Deusto, the Public University of Navarra, and the University of Pau and Pays de l'Adur. The UEU is currently headquartered in the Markeskua Palace (Eibar) and has 1,200 members. It organises training in Basque at university level in different formats: postgraduate courses, specialised courses, seminars, professional congresses (e.g. Computer Science congresses, Informatikari Euskaldunen Bilkurak), training aimed at teachers and professionals, summer courses and research projects related to the above (master...); it also offers postgraduate studies.a m The UEU offers studies in the Basque Autonomous Community, in Navarre and in the French Basque Country, with the UEU's objective being to promote a quality Basque-speaking university throughout the territory where Basque language is used. According to this approach, achieving a university that works in Basque would be a fundamental element so that the forecast made by Humboldt is not fulfilled and Basque continues for many years in the list of living languages. Furthermore, the experience gained with Basque could be a reference for the preservation of other minority languages. The Rectors of the UEU have been the following: Manex Goihenetxe (1973‚Äì1976), Martin Orbe (1976‚Äì1983), Baleren Bakaikoa (1983‚Äì1987), Inaki Irazabalbeitia (1987‚Äì1991), Kepa Altonaga (1991‚Äì1996), Mikel Aizpuru (1996‚Äì2000), Xabier Isasi (2000‚Äì2004), Aitzpea Leizaola (2004‚Äì2005), Lore Erriondo (2005‚Äì2010), Karmele Artetxe (2010‚Äì2014), I√±aki Alegr√≠a (2014‚Äì2018) eta Kepa Sarasola (2018‚Äì).  Publications  The UEU published its first book in 1977, since then until 2018 it has published 419, more or less 10 books per year. In the field of book publishing, since its inception the UEU has pursued two objectives: on the one hand, to create a bibliographic infrastructure at university level, and on the other, to refine the terminology and syntax in Basque. The electronic version of most of the more than 400 books published by the UEU are publicly accessible in its digital library Buruxkak. In addition to books, since 2003 it also publishes academic journals. In 2018 there were four journals: Uztaro, about social sciences and created in 1990; Aldiri, Arkitektura eta abar, about architecture and created in 2009; Osagaiz, about health sciences and created in 2017; and finally Kondaira, about history created in 2003.  Postgraduate degrees and own degrees  Beginning in 2001 and in collaboration with the University of the Basque Country, the UEU has taught 14 own degrees or postgraduates, of which more than 240 students have graduated. For example in 2018, two courses were given; one on \\"Translation and technology\\" and the other on \\"the use of new technologies in education\\".  Training courses  Since its creation in 1973, the UEU has delivered more than 1,900 training courses at university level. Online courses began to be delivered in 2003. The first MOOC course (Introduction to Android programming / Android programazioaren hastapenak) took place in 2013. The courses have always been organized from the thematic sections of the UEU, which are the following: Anthropology, Theater, Architecture, Art, Bertsolaritza, Economy, Philosophy, Physics, Glotodidactics, History of Linguistics, Informatics, Translation, Journalism, Chemistry, Climatology and Meteorology, Literature, Mathematics, Music, Natural Sciences, Health Sciences, Pedagogy, Psychology, Sexology, Sociolinguistics, Sociology, and Law.  Databases and Internet services  The UEU has created several databases and Internet services associated with new technologies to respond to training needs and to serve to the university community in Basque: *Inguma: database on the production of the Basque scientific community. Inguma is a source of information about everything that has been produced orally and in written form in Basque within the academic world since 1968 when the guidelines that led to the unification of the unified Basque language began to be set. In 2018, in total, it included cataloguing. There are both written documents (books, articles, prologues, reviews, translations, critical editions, research projects, doctoral theses) and oral documents summer (conferences, courses, meetings, conferences, subjects). *Artizarra social network for professionals and researchers. *Buruxkak. The digital library of the UEU, in 2018 it was offering the digital versions of 390 books from among the 419 published by this entity. *Otarrea. A compilation of works, reports, notes, and other types of university documents to be shared freely under a Creative Commons license. In 2018 it contained 941 documents distributed by fields in this way: Art and music (4), Humanities (112), Social sciences (333), Engineering and technology (393), Health sciences (19), Applied sciences (2) and Sciences (78). *Tesiker, PhD theses in Basque. The Tesiker database offers information and access to more than 450 theses that have been published in Basque. This web service is offered from the Basque Government's website after having been collected by the UEU. *Unibertsitatea.net, meeting place and point of reference for anyone associated with or interested in the university, such as students, teaching staff, researchers, parents, members of the press, etc.university community portal. It publishes news about the Basque university community (including 140 interviews with young researchers, and 10 blogs (economy, Language processing, Art, Environment...). *Iparrorratza, orientation for university access. The Iparrorratza service offers a counselling service for young people entering university to help them choose their studies.  Building the community of young researchers  Since 2012, the UEU has promoted the creation of a community of young researchers with the aim of promoting multidisciplinary knowledge and exchange. Three of its most relevant activities are the following: *Ikergazte Congress (in Basque; Iker (research) gazte(young)) This congress has been held every two years since 2015. The number of participants was always greater than 200 and more than 120 articles were presented. *Txiotesia Competition. With the same objective of promoting mutual knowledge, since 2012, this competition has been organized biennially. Participants describe their doctoral thesis work in just 6 tweets. * Web portal with interviews, The portal unibertsitatea.net has interviewed more than 120 young researchers.

Its main campus is in the National University of Ireland in Galway City and it also has three other locations around the West of Ireland. They provide courses at different levels: degrees and postgraduate courses as well as diplomas and other short courses. *Col√°iste na h√âireann (English: \\"College of Ireland\\") is a third- level college in Dublin, offering qualifications in the study of translation and the Irish language. = Welsh = * Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol (in English: Welsh National College). It is known in both Welsh and English simply as Coleg. It was established in 2011 by the Welsh Government to work with universities in Wales to develop Welsh-language courses and resources for students; it also provides and advances Welsh medium courses, scholarship and research in Welsh universities. It works through branches in Welsh Universities to enable more opportunities to study for Welsh medium students in partnership with the universities. Its aim is to increase the number of students who choose to study part or all of their course in Welsh. It funds under- and post-graduate scholarships, sponsors Welsh medium lecturers and supports students who study in Welsh. *Y Gymdeithas Feddygol (Welsh language medical society) ‚Äì supports the right to receive healthcare in Welsh and cooperates with any organisation to deliver it. It encourages Welsh medium healthcare studies and gives opportunities to present their work in Welsh. It gives opportunities for students and doctors to network in our annual conferences and the National Eisteddfod.

The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver, Colorado. Season two stars John Forsythe as millionaire oil magnate Blake Carrington; Linda Evans as his wife Krystle; Pamela Sue Martin as Blake and Alexis's headstrong daughter Fallon; Al Corley as Blake and Alexis's earnest son Steven; John James as Fallon's ex-husband Jeff Colby; Lloyd Bochner as Jeff's uncle, Cecil Colby; Pamela Bellwood as Claudia Blaisdel, the widow of Krystle's former lover; Heather Locklear as Krystle's troublemaking niece Sammy Jo; Lee Bergere as Carrington majordomo Joseph Anders; and James Farentino as psychologist Dr. Nicholas Toscanni. The season also introduced Joan Collins as Alexis Carrington, Blake's ex-wife and the mother of Fallon and Steven. Development In the first episode of the second season, titled \\"Enter Alexis\\", the mysterious witness from the season one finale removes her sunglasses to reveal British actress Joan Collins as a new arrival to the series. Series creators Richard and Esther Shapiro conceived the character as Blake's ex-wife Madeline, who they intended to be played by Sophia Loren for four to six episodes. Writers Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock, brought in for season two, renamed her Alexis, told Aaron Spelling that Loren was not right for the part, and warned him that \\"If you get rid of this character in four episodes, you are throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars.\\" Collins said in 2018 that in addition to Loren, producers pursued Elizabeth Taylor and Jessica Walter. According to Collins, \\"They were waiting for Jessica until the very last minute, so they didn't cast me until two weeks before we started shooting.\\" Collins's Alexis Carrington blazed a trail across the show and its story lines. The additions of Collins and the Pollocks are generally credited with Dynastys subsequent rise in the Nielsen ratings. Esther Shapiro said the season one DVD commentary, \\"When Alexis came into it, it changed the tenor...And that's the way they are now on television: you have your traditional villain, and I think that plays to a different denominator.\\" The Pollocks \\"soft-pedaled the business angle\\" of the show and \\"bombarded viewers with every soap opera staple in the book, presented at such a fast clip that a new tragedy seemed to befall the Carrington family every five minutes.\\" The second season was ranked #19 in the United States. Corley left Dynasty at the end of the second season in 1982, after complaining publicly in Interview that \\"Steven doesn't have any fun... He doesn't laugh; he has no humor\\". Corley also lamented Steven's \\"ever-shifting sexual preferences\\", and stated that he wanted \\"to do other things\\". Plot The surprise witness at Blake's murder trial is his ex-wife Alexis, Fallon and Steven's mother. Her testimony about his character is damaging, and while Fallon is icy to the mother she feels abandoned her, Steven is drawn to Alexis. The former Mrs. Carrington's testimony notwithstanding, Krystle is immediately put off by Alexis's condescending attitude and manipulations. Later, Krystle's discovery that Alexis had caused her miscarriage by intentionally startling her horse with a gunshot settles Alexis as Krystle's implacable nemesis. Other new characters of the season are the psychiatrist Nick Toscanni, who tries to seduce Krystle while bedding Fallon and plotting against Blake; and Krystle's greedy niece Sammy Jo Dean (Heather Locklear), who marries Steven for his money. The season finale sees Blake left for dead on a mountain after a fight with Nick.

It is also known as Dounreay House. The castle and its associated structures are a Scheduled Ancient Monument. History The castle is thought to date from the latter part of the 16th century. It was a property of the Sinclairs, the owner in 1614 being William Sinclair of Dunbeath, while in 1726 it was one of the lodgings of the Earl of Caithness. Ownership passed to the Forbeses, to the Mackays of Reay, and then to the Mackays of Tongue. Occupation continued until 1863, but the castle was unroofed and ruinous by 1910. The site was used a farm, with the courtyard being the farmyard, with the first of two ranges of cottages possibly being added south east of the castle in the 17th century. Cromwellian troops were housed in the castle in the mid-17th century. The site was leveled with the exception of the castle and the north-east cottage block during the building of the research establishment. Structure The castle comprised a three- storey main block, and the jamb containing a scale-and-platt stair. Above an unvaulted basement was the hall. The dimensions of the main block were by , and those of the wing by , while the walls were about . The entrance is in the re-entrant angle of the jamb, below the staircase. The castle was enclosed by a barmkin, parts of which survive on the south western and seaward sides. The former is keyed into the tower and the latter has been incorporated into a later cottage wall. A kitchen range was added, built against the barmkin, and blocked an original gun loop in the tower. The north west angle of the castle has collapsed, as has part of the western wall, filling much of the interior with rubble. In addition, the northern wall was bulging outwards as of 1964. In 1997‚Äì1998 an \\"archaeological monitoring exercise\\" was conducted in the castle courtyard and on the beach. Due to security concerns, the test pits were excavated by machine, supervised by the archaeologists remotely and by local staff on site. Little was found other than a large millstone, probably associated with the mill depicted on the 1st edition of the Ordnance Survey map.

His city was part of the Roman Empire, and he came to dominate the Roman East when in 260 he defeated ShapurI, the Sasanian emperor of Persia, who had invaded the Roman Empire. Odaenathus besieged the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon in 263, and although the city did not fall, the campaign led to a full restoration of Roman provinces taken by ShapurI. In the aftermath of his Persian war, Odaenathus assumed the title King of Kings, which was a challenge to the Persian monarch's claims of authority in the region. Odaenathus ruled the Roman East unopposed with imperial consent. In 267, he was assassinated alongside his eldest son Herodianus while conducting a campaign against Germanic raiders in Bithynia; he was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of the widow queen Zenobia. Palmyrene portraits were usually abstract, depicting little individuality. Most reported portraits of Odaenathus are undated and have no inscriptions, making identification speculative. Generally, the criteria for determining whether a piece represents the king are its material (imported marble, in contrast to local limestone) and iconography, such as the presence of royal attributes (crowns or diadems). Several limestone head portraits from Palmyra were identified by several twentieth-century scholars as depicting Odaenathus, based on criteria such as the size of the portrait and the presence of a wreath; the latter element was not special in Palmyrene portraits, as priests were also depicted with wreaths. More recent research on the limestone portraits indicates that these pieces were probably funerary objects depicting private citizens. Two marble heads, both reflecting a high level of individuality, are more likely to be portraits of the king. The first marble sculpture depicts a man in a royal diadem, and the second shows the king in an eastern royal tiara. Two Palmyrene tesserae, depicting a bearded king wearing a diadem and an earring, are also likely to be depictions of Odaenathus, and two mosaic panels have been identified as possibly depicting him: one of them portrays a rider (probably Odaenathus) killing a Chimera, which fits a prophecy in the thirteenth Sibylline Oracle that includes an account contemporary to Odaenathus, prophesying that he will kill ShapurI, who is described as a beast. Background Roman regions under the authority of Odaenathus (yellow) and the Palmyrene kingdom (green) Odaenathus belonged to an important Palmyrene family and was elected as \\"ras\\" (lord) of Palmyra by the city's council in the 240s. As a Roman city on the borders with Persia, Palmyra was affected by the constant war between the two empires, which culminated in 260 with the defeat and capture of the Roman emperor Valerian by the Persian Sasanian emperor ShapurI in the Battle of Edessa. Following the defeat of Rome, Odaenathus declared himself king of Palmyra, and attacked ShapurI causing him to retreat from Syria. Odaenathus was made the effective ruler of the Roman East by Gallienus, the son and successor of Valerian, who appointed Odaenathus a Corrector totius orientis (righter of the entire East). In 263 Odaenathus besieged the Persian capital Ctesiphon, and evicted the Persians from the Roman provinces they had conquered. In the same year he assumed the title of King of Kings and declared his son Herodianus co-ruler. The title was traditionally held by Near Eastern Seleucid and Parthian rulers and Sassanian monarchs, and by adopting it Odaenathus indicated that he considered his dynasty (not the Sassanian) the legitimate successor of the Parthians. Odaenathus was assassinated alongside Herodianus in 267 while campaigning against Germanic raiders in Heraclea Pontica, a city in Bithynia; the perpetrator and motives are unclear. Odaenathus' widow, Zenobia, declared herself regent to their son Vaballathus, who succeeded his father. Clearly attributed busts or statues of Odaenathus have not survived, and the king did not mint coins bearing his image. A few small clay tesserae were found in Palmyra with impressions of the king and his name, but no large-scale portrait has been confirmed through inscriptions (limiting knowledge of Odaenathus' appearance). In general, Palmyrene sculptures are rudimentary portraits; although individuality was not abandoned, most pieces exhibit little difference among figures of a similar age and gender. Limestone sculptures Several large head sculptures have been suggested by scholars to be depictions of the king: =In Copenhagen and Istanbul= Sculpture in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek (code NCG 1121) Two head sculptures, one at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek museum in Copenhagen (code NCG 1121) and the other at the ƒ∞stanbul Archaeology Museums (code D111.6), are nearly identical and appear to have been crafted by the same sculptor. Both portraits are made of limestone; the Copenhagen head is tall and the Istanbul piece is in height. Both heads are worked in the round; the Copenhagen sculpture is more detailed at the back than the Istanbul one, and both depict their subject wearing a wreath. The Copenhagen sculpture has a miniature bust in the middle of the wreath; although the Istanbul sculpture probably had the same feature, it is uncertain due to a deep abrasion. The eyes of the Copenhagen head (in which the eyelashes are depicted with very thin incisions) are hollowed, to hold glass paste or other material; the irises and pupils are engraved in the Istanbul head. Inlaid eyes are rare in Palmyrene sculptures. The columns of the Great Colonnade at Palmyra had consoles which held statues of notable Palmyrenes. The Danish rabbi and scholar David Jakob Simonsen proposed that the Copenhagen head was part of a console statue of a Palmyrene who was honoured by the city. The archaeologist Frederik Poulsen considered that the wreath on the Copenhagen head is reminiscent of portraits of the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, and the long face is similar to portraits of Emperor Maximinus Thrax. The archaeologist Valentin M√ºller, based on the Copenhagen head's moving posture, forehead, and a characteristic fold between the nose and mouth, proposed that it was sculpted during the time of Emperor Decius (reigned 249‚Äì251). King Odaenathus was the son of Hairan, as attested by many inscriptions. In earlier scholarship, a character designated \\"OdaenathusI\\", whose existence was deduced from a sepulchral inscription in Palmyra recording the lineage of the tomb's owner (the supposed Odaenathus I), was considered the father of Hairan and grandfather of King Odaenathus (who was designated OdaenathusII). In a 1976 article, the archaeologist Harald Ingholt proposed a date range of 230‚Äì250 for the Copenhagen and Istanbul heads, a decade earlier or later also possible. Ingholt concluded that the heads should be dated to 250, and represented OdaenathusI, without excluding the possibility that they might represent OdaenathusII or his father Hairan. In 1985, the archaeologist Michael Gawlikowski proved that OdaenathusI was identical to King Odaenathus, which is confirmed by an inscription securely attributed to the king, recording his lineage, the same as that mentioned in the earlier known sepulchral inscription. Based on the conclusions of Gawlikowski, the archaeologist Ernest Will assigned the Copenhagen portrait to King Odaenathus. The archaeologist Klaus Parlasca rejected Ingholt's hypothesis regarding the honorary function of the portraits, and considered the two heads fragments of a funeral kline (sarcophagus lid). The archaeologist Jean-Charles Balty noted the relative incompleteness of the rear of both portraits and the thickness of the necks, indicating that the heads were not intended to be seen in profile. This supports Parlasca's theory that the heads were part of a monumental, frontal kline in the exedra (semicircular recess) of a tomb; an example of such composition is the hypogeum (underground tomb) of the Palmyrene noble Shalamallat, which has a similar sculpture on the lid of a sarcophagus. The historian Udo Hartmann considered Ingholt's arguments unconvincing, and his identification arbitrary. The archaeologist Eugenia Equini Schneider agreed with Simonsen and Ingholt that the heads had an honorary function, but (based on their iconography) dated them to the late second or early third century. =From the hexagonal tomb= Sculpture in the Palmyra museum from the hexagonal tomb (code B2726/9163) Three head sculptures were excavated in 1994 from a hexagonal tomb in Palmyra's northern necropolis by its head of antiquities, Khaled al-As'ad, and moved to the city's museum. According to Balty, the heads are full replicas, intended to represent the same person; their similarities are not the result of a workshop's standards. They resemble the heads in the Copenhagen and Istanbul museums, chiefly differing in the hair style. One of the hexagonal tomb portraits, code B2726/9163, is tall and was identified as a portrait of the king by the archaeologist Michel Fortin. Balty disagreed with Fortin's identification, stating that their discovery in a tomb and their material (limestone) support identification as funerary portraits. Gawlikowski suggested that the heads depicted three men from the same family, and considered that their excavation from a tomb, and their remarkable resemblance to the portraits in Copenhagen and Istanbul, confirm that the latter two were also funerary, and not honorary, objects. =In Damascus museum= The sculpted head (code C1519) can be compared with dated Palmyrene funerary portraits and contemporary Roman portraiture and suggests a mid-third-century crafting date. It is tall, and the nose and most of the mouth are abraded. The sculpture represents an older man, with deep wrinkles on the forehead. The face is impersonal; the engraved eyes look straight at the viewer but are motionless, distant, and devoid of expression. The head is crowned by a laurel wreath with a cabochon gem in its centre. The sculpture has a minimum of individuality: the modelling of the face lacks articulation, the eyes are expressionless, and the facial hair is rigid and stylized. The portrait is influenced by a standard artistic model. The massive square skull is similar to the model used for Emperor Gallienus' portraits, so Gallienus' model may have been modified to incorporate features typical of Palmyrene portraiture. The piece was tentatively identified as depicting the king by the archaeologist Johannes Kollwitz, but Parlasca considered it a fragment of a funeral kline. =Benaki Museum= A limestone head sculpture, tall, is at the Benaki Museum in Athens under inventory number 36361. The head was acquired commercially in 1989, and no information about its exact excavation location in Syria is known; it was moved to the museum a decade later. The limestone material and many similarities to the portraits in Copenhagen and Istanbul make Palmyra the most likely place of origin. The face is severely damaged, and many parts of the wreath and nose are broken. The portrait is characterized by the proportions and elongated construction of the head. Its laurel wreath is incomplete, stopping just behind the ears. A miniature bust whose head is damaged is in the centre of the wreath, above the forehead. The eyes are large, and framed by sharp eyelids. The facial features of the man depicted indicate advanced age, and his expression is reminiscent of portraits depicting Roman emperors, philosophers and priests. The back of the portrait is unfinished and the neck is massive and thick. Due to the resemblance of the Benaki head to the portraits at the Copenhagen and Istanbul museums, the archaeologist Stavros Vlizos proposed that the man belonged to the family of Odaenathus. =Limestone portraits: conclusion= Collection of Palmyrene funerary portrait headstones in the Vatican Museums. The one on the right depicts the deceased with a wreath. According to Gawlikowski, the wreaths appearing on the limestone portraits such as those in the Copenhagen and Istanbul museums do not necessarily indicate Roman corona civica honours; much headgear worn by Palmyrene priests had wreaths without Roman connotations. Many funerary portraits used as headstones in Palmyrene tombs depicted the deceased with wreaths whose meaning, in a Palmyrene context, is unclear. Gawlikowski, agreeing with Parlasca, maintained that most of the oversized limestone heads with thick necks were connected to funeral practices such as sarcophagus lids; this includes the portraits from the hexagonal tomb and the Copenhagen and Istanbul museums. As for Simonsen's suggestion that the Copenhagen portrait belonged to an honorary statue set on a bracket (console) atop a column in the city's streets, Palmyrene honorary statues that stood on the columns consoles were made of bronze, and it is doubtful that the brackets could support the weight of stone statues; such honorary portraits in Palmyra stood on bases on the ground. According to Gawlikowski, there is no reason to believe that the portraits are of the same person, despite their similarities; the limestone portraits were not depictions of the king or his family, and they appear to be funerary in function. Marble portraits Marble was a symbol of political and social prestige, and had to be imported to Palmyra; most of Palmyra's sculptures were made of limestone, and the use of marble is noteworthy. =Tiara portrait= Herodianus' lead token in the National Museum of Damascus. The headdress is similar to that of Odaenathus' reported tiara portrait. This portrait was found in 1940 in the vicinity of the Palmyrene agora at the same time that five headless marble statues, depicting two men and three women, were found in a building considered to be the senate (also near the agora); it is uncertain if the tiara portrait was found in the same building. Although the portrait is lost and was never published, photographs of it survive in the archives of l'Institut Fran√ßais d'Arch√©ologie du Proche- Orient (IFAPO). The face is oval and a long, drooping, curved moustache joins the beard. The lower part of the face is broken, only the first row of beard curls surviving. The nose is also broken; the eyes are wide open and the lower eyelids are a little heavy, giving intensity to the expression. Two vertical folds at the beginning of the nose accentuate the eyes, which are topped with strong eyebrows. The forehead is high, with two horizontal furrows. The headdress, apparently a turban, is damaged at the back and on the right temple. In the middle of the turban's top, a circular hole apparently housed a dowel which held another headdress piece that would have been framed by the turban's elevated rim. The portrait's craftsmanship is remarkable, according to Balty, and reflects a nobility of expression. Its face was polished with care; the turban has a rippled surface, partly treated with a gradine (toothed chisel) to accentuate the difference between the fabric headdress and the strands of the hair. Balty concluded that the missing part of the headdress which fit into the turban was a royal tiara or mitre, reminiscent of similar crowns worn by many contemporary Eastern monarchs from Commagene, Hatra, Osroene, several Parthian kings, and seen in some portraits of ArdashirI (the first Sasanian king). A Palmyrene lead token in the National Museum of Damascus has a profile of Odaenathus' son and co-King of Kings, Herodianus, who is beardless and wearing a high conical tiara adorned with a crescent. In Balty's view, the Damascus token confirms that the missing part of the tiara portrait's headdress is a royal tiara, and the sculpture depicts Odaenathus, since Herodianus, who died along his father in 267, is depicted beardless on the token. Gawlikowski also considered this identification highly probable if the missing part of the headdress is a tiara. =Diadem portrait= Odaenathus' son and successor, Vaballathus, wearing a diadem A marble head portrait, in the Palmyra Museum (Inv. B 459/1662), apparently was part of a life-sized statue. The piece is poorly preserved and fragmentary. The hair begins on the centre top of the head with long sparse strands, which are carved flat and held by a diadem. The beard binds to the hair at the temples and is placed low on the cheeks with a stiff, clean cut. The forehead is furrowed by deep lines beginning at the top of the nose. The man is depicted in traditional Greek style except for his hair, which resembles Iranian Parthian examples rather than the hairstyle seen on Roman portraits. Balty considered it likely that the portrait depicts Odaenathus, noting the similarities to the tiara portrait: the eyes are also wide open, and the gaze has the same intensity. The most noticeable difference is the simpler hairstyle of the diadem portrait; Balty suggested that if the hairstyle difference makes it necessary to ascribe the diadem portrait to a different man than the tiara portrait, Odaenathus' viceroy Septimius Worod is a suitable candidate since the tiara (a symbol of royalty) is missing. While lacking the tiara, the portrait depicts its subject wearing a diadem, the main item in the regalia of Hellenistic monarchs; it was used to connect rulers to Alexander the Great, a source of legitimacy for Hellenistic kings. The diadem was probably linked in a Greek context to the god Dionysus, who played a part in royal ideology as a victorious leader, and the headdress became a symbol of monarchy in the East. The Hellenistic Seleucid kings of Syria used a white cloth diadem, and their legacy was a source of legitimacy in the East for early Parthian monarchs against Roman claims (leading to the adoption of their symbols by the Parthian court). The diadem depicted in the portrait is Oriental in style, reminiscent of Parthian iconography. Odaenathus' successor and son, Vaballathus, was depicted wearing a diadem on his coins; this indicated his royal rank to his eastern subjects, and Herodianus was also crowned with a diadem and tiara by his father in 263. Gawlikowski considered it likely that the portrait depicts Odaenathus, and that the lack of a tiara (which made Balty hesitant in his identification of the portrait's subject as Odaenathus) is offset by the royal diadem. Tesserae portraits Palmyrene tesserae are small tokens with a variety of designs, which were probably used as invitation tickets to ritual temple banquets. About 1,000 designs were known in 2019; most are terracotta, but a few are lead, iron, or bronze. The major reference for Palmyrene tesserae is the Recueil des Tess√®res de Palmyre (RTP). Some depict Odaenathus: =Tessera RTP 4= RTP 4: Odaenathus (right) and Heracles (left) This tessera is in the National Museum of Damascus. On one side, a man's head is shown; covering all the available surface, he has a heavily built face, a full beard, and thick hair or a headdress (probably the lion-skin dress of Heracles). The other side of the tessera has the profile of a mature bearded man wearing a royal diadem and a triangular earring. Tesserae are made by pressing a gem into clay; such seals, portraying royals without inscription, can be issued only in the name of the person depicted. Gawlikowski proposed that the king is Odaenathus. If Heracles is depicted, this was meant to glorify the monarch's victory over Persia; the tessera could have been a ticket to the coronation of Odaenathus and his son, Herodianus. =Tessera RTP 5= RTP 5: Odaenathus (right) and Herodianus (left) This tessera, also in the National Museum of Damascus, depicts a king in a tiara on one side; a ball of hair in chignon style is attached to the back of the head. The king's iconography is similar in style to the portrait of Herodianus on the lead token. The authors of the RTP postulated the presence of a beard, and considered it possible that the king is Odaenathus. Gawlikowski disagreed, as the face depicted is youthful and cannot be a representation of the middle aged Odaenathus. Gawlikowski also disputed the presence of a beard. Although the other side of the tessera is severely damaged, traces of a triangular earring similar to that depicted in tessera RTP 4 can be seen. Gawlikowski concluded that Herodianus is depicted with a tiara and Odaenathus, in the same bearded portrait as RTP 4 with the diadem and earring, must have appeared on the worn-out side. =Tessera RTP 736= RTP 736: Odaenathus with Hairan (right) and with Vaballathus (left) With seven known pieces, this series in the National Museum of Damascus depicts two men reclining on a couch in priestly attire on each side. On one side, the name of Odaenathus' eldest son Hairan (I) is inscribed under the couch. Several scholars, including Udo Hartmann, maintain that HairanI is Herodianus, and the latter is the Greek version of the local name. The historian David S. Potter argued that the Hairan on tessera RTP 736 is HairanII (a younger son of Odaenathus, whom Potter identified with Herodianus). On the other side of the tessera, the name of Vaballathus is inscribed; on both sides, the name of Odaenathus is inscribed to the left of the men. The tesserae depict the king on both sides, his eldest son on one side and his eventual successor on the other. Since no royal attributes are shown, the tesserae might date to the late 250s. Mosaic In 2003, a mosaic floor was discovered in Palmyra; based on the border style, it dates to the second half of the third century. The mosaic floor is a carpet of geometric and symmetrical composition, surrounding a rectangular panel in the centre which is divided into two panels of equal dimensions; Gawlikowski named them La chasse au tigre (The Tiger Hunt) and Le tableau de Bell√©rophon (The panel of Bellerophon). =The Tiger Hunt= Mosaic of the tiger hunt, Palmyra The panel depicts a galloping rider attacking a rearing tiger, with a smaller tiger (apparently a female) under the horse's hooves. According to Gianluca Serra (a conservation zoologist based in Palmyra at the time of the panel's discovery), both are Caspian tigers, which were once common in the region of Hyrcania in Iran. The composition strongly resembles some Sassanid silver plates, and the rider is wearing Palmyrene military attire. Above the horse's head is a three-line inscription. The text is Palmyrene cursive and probably the signature of the artist, but the many errors in writing and its incongruous position raise the possibility that it is a secondary addition which attempted to replace an original inscription. The last two letters of the inscription (MR, much larger and more professionally executed than the rest) do not make sense in their current context. Gawlikowski reconstructed them as the word MRN (our lord), a title held in Palmyra by Odaenathus and Herodianus, and interpreted the tiger-hunt scene as a metaphor for Odaenathus' victory over ShapurI; the Hyrcanian tigers may represent the Persians, and the rider may represent Odaenathus. =The Panel of Bellerophon= Bellerophon is riding Pegasus, piercing the Chimera with his lance. In the Palmyra mosaic, Bellerophon is distinguished from his representation in Europe; instead of being heroically nude, he is dressed in the same manner as the rider in the tiger-hunt scene: pants, tunic, and a kandys. The rider wears a bell-shaped helmet with a floating plume. Two eagles fly at the top of the panel, stretching wreaths on both sides of Bellerophon's head. The costume is known Parthian court attire, recognizable in the paintings of the synagogue of Doura-Europos depicting important figures such as the pharaoh in the Book of Exodus. The shape of the helmet has no parallel in contemporary military use, Persian or Roman; it is reminiscent of rare Hellenistic samples from Pergamon, a style adopted in Palmyra for war deities such as Arsu. The thirteenth Sibylline Oracle, a collection of prophecies probably compiled by Syrian authors to glorify Syrian rulers, includes a prophecy added to the initial text during the reign of Odaenathus: \\"Then shall come one who was sent by the sun [Odaenathus], a mighty and fearful lion, breathing much flame. Then he with much shameless daring will destroy ... the greatest beastvenomous, fearful and emitting a great deal of hisses [Shapur I]\\". Gawlikowski proposed that Odaenathus is depicted as Bellerophon, and the Chimera (who fits the description of ShapurI as a great beast in the thirteenth Sibylline Oracle) is a representation of the Persians.

It is decided at various levels of the government, including the individual states. This policy has been developed over the approximately two centuries since the invention of vaccination with the purpose of eradicating disease from the U.S. population, or creating a herd immunity. Policies intended to encourage vaccination impact numerous areas of law, including regulation of vaccine safety, funding of vaccination programs, vaccine mandates, adverse event reporting requirements, and compensation for injuries asserted to be associated with vaccination. Regulation of vaccine safety The United States Food and Drug Administration has the authority to enforce the safety of vaccines. The FDA requires that all new vaccines first be tested in laboratory settings and on animals,21 CFR 312.23(a)(8). and must then carry out a series of increasingly stringent tests in human subjects. Once vaccines are introduced to the market, the FDA regularly inspects their production facilities, tests their quality, and receives reports of adverse reactions. Vaccination schedule and mandates The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes scientific recommendations which are generally followed by the federal government, state governments, and private health insurance companies, including making recommendations for the vaccination schedule used in the United States. All 50 states in the U.S. mandate immunizations for children in order to enroll in public school, but the specific vaccines required differ from state to state and various exemptions are available depending on the state. All states have exemptions for people who have medical contraindications to vaccines, and all states except for California, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia allow religious exemptions, while sixteen states allow parents to cite personal, conscientious, philosophical, or other objections. An increasing number of parents are using religious and philosophical exemptions: researchers have cited this increased use of exemptions as contributing to loss of herd immunity within these communities, and hence an increasing number of disease outbreaks. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises physicians to respect the refusal of parents to vaccinate their child after adequate discussion, unless the child is put at significant risk of harm (e.g., during an epidemic, or after a deep and contaminated puncture wound). Under such circumstances, the AAP states that parental refusal of immunization constitutes a form of medical neglect and should be reported to state child protective services agencies. All vaccines recommended by the U.S. government for its citizens are required for green card applicants. This requirement stirred controversy when it was applied to the HPV vaccine in July 2008 due to the cost of the vaccine. In addition, the other thirteen required vaccines prevent highly contagious diseases communicable through the respiratory route, while HPV is only spread through sexual contact. In November 2009, this requirement was canceled. Though the federal guidelines do not require written consent in order to receive a vaccination, they do require doctors give the recipients or legal representatives a Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). Specific informed consent laws are made by the states. Several states allow minors to legally consent to vaccination over parental objections under the mature minor doctrine. = School children = The United States has a long history of school vaccination requirements. The first school vaccination requirement was enacted in the 1850s in Massachusetts to prevent the spread of smallpox. The school vaccination requirement was put in place after the compulsory school attendance law caused a rapid increase in the number of children in public schools, increasing the risk of smallpox outbreaks. The early movement towards school vaccination laws began at the local level including counties, cities, and boards of education. By 1827, Boston had become the first city to mandate that all children entering public schools show proof of vaccination. In addition, in 1855 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had established its own statewide vaccination requirements for all students entering school, this influenced other states to implement similar statewide vaccination laws in schools as seen in New York in 1862, Connecticut in 1872, Pennsylvania in 1895, and later the Midwest, South and Western US. By 1963, 20 states had school vaccination laws. These vaccination laws resulted in political debates throughout the United States as those opposed to vaccination sought to repeal local policies and state laws. An example of this political controversy occurred in 1893 in Chicago, where less than 10 percent of the children were vaccinated despite the twelve year old state law. Resistance was seen at the local level of the school district as some local school boards and superintendents opposed the state vaccination laws, leading the state board health inspectors to examine vaccination policies in schools. Resistance proceeded during the mid-1900s and in 1977 a nationwide Childhood Immunization Initiative was developed with the goal of increasing vaccination rates among children to 90% by 1979. During the two-year period of observation, the initiative reviewed the immunization records of more than 28 million children and vaccinated children who had not received the recommended vaccines. In 1922, the constitutionality of childhood vaccination was examined in the Supreme Court case Zucht v. King.260 U.S. 174 (1922). The court ruled that a school could deny admission to children who failed to provide a certification of vaccination for the protection of the public health. In 1987, a measles epidemic occurred in Maricopa County, Arizona and another court case, Maricopa County Health Department vs. Harmon, examined the arguments of an individual's right to education over the states need to protect against the spread of disease. The court found it prudent to take action to combat the spread of disease by denying un-vaccinated children a place in school until the risk for the spread of measles had passed. The Supreme Court has not since decided a vaccination mandate case, but noted in a subsequent case, Prince v. Massachusetts,321 U.S. 158 (1944). that the state had power over certain activities of children, including requiring that they be vaccinated.Brian Dean Abramson, Vaccine, Vaccination, and Immunization Law (Bloomberg Law, 2019), 6-10. The court in Prince said: Schools in the United States require an updated immunization record for all incoming and returning students. While all states require an immunization record, this does not mean that all students must get vaccinated. Exemptions are determined at a state level. In the United States, exemptions take one of three forms: medical, in which a vaccine is contraindicated due to a component ingredient allergy or existing medical condition; religious; and personal philosophical opposition. As of 2019, 45 states allow religious exemptions, with some states requiring proof of religious membership. Until 2019, only Mississippi, West Virginia and California did not permit religious exemptions. However, the 2019 measles outbreak led to the repeal of religious exemptions in the state of New York and for the MMR vaccination in the state of Washington. Prior to 2019, 18 states allowed personal or philosophical opposition to vaccination, but the measles outbreak also led to the repeal of these exemptions in a number of states. Research studies have found a correlation between the rise of vaccine- preventable diseases and non-medical exemptions from school vaccination requirements. Mandatory vaccinations for attending public schools have received criticism. Parents say that vaccine mandates in order to attend public schools prevent one's right to choose, especially if the vaccinations could be harmful. Some people believe that being forced to get a vaccination could cause trauma, and may lead to not seeking out medical care/attention ever again.Cantor, Julie D. ‚ÄúMandatory Measles Vaccination in New York City - Reflections on a Bold Experiment.‚Äù New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 381, no. 2, July 2019, pp. 101‚Äì103. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1056/NEJMp1905941 In the constitutional law, some states have the liberty to withdraw to public health regulations, which includes mandatory vaccination laws that threaten fines. Certain laws are being looked at for immunization requirements, and are trying to be changed, but cannot succeed due to legal challenges.Barraza, Leila, et al. ‚ÄúThe Latest in Vaccine Policies: Selected Issues in School Vaccinations, Healthcare Worker Vaccinations, and Pharmacist Vaccination Authority Laws.‚Äù Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics, vol. 45, Mar. 2017, pp. 16‚Äì19. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1177/1073110517703307. After California removed non-medical exemptions for school entrance, lawsuits were filed arguing for the right for children to attend school regardless of their vaccination history, and to suspend the bill‚Äôs implementation altogether. However, all such lawsuits ultimately failed. = Health care workers = Most states have some kind of requirement in place that at least some kinds of health care workers receive certain vaccinations intended to protect their patients from having communicable diseases passed to them through the health care workers. The vaccines at issue often include those for influenza, measles, hepatitis B for healthcare workers likely to be exposed to human blood, and rubella for healthcare workers likely to be in contact with pregnant women. = Military personnel = Judge's cartoon of Rudyard Kipling's famous poem \\"The White Man's Burden\\" published in 1899. The poem's philosophy quickly was utilized to explain/justify the United States response to annexation of the Philippines. The United States used the \\"white man's burden\\" as an argument for imperial control of the Philippines and Puerto Rico on the basis of moral necessity to ensure the spread of civility and modernity. Immunizations are often compulsory for military enlistment in the U.S. The United States has a very complex history with compulsory vaccination, particularly in enforcing compulsory vaccinations both domestically and abroad to protect American soldiers during times of war. There are hundreds of thousands of examples of soldier deaths that were not the result of combat wounds, but were instead from disease. During the American Revolutionary War, General George Washington required American soldiers to undergo variolation for smallpox out of concern that the British, who had long engaged in that practice in their own military, would be able to use smallpox as a weapon against the Continental Army. Among wars with high death tolls from disease is the Civil War where an estimated 620,000 soldiers died from disease. American soldiers in other countries have spread diseases that ultimately disrupted entire societies and healthcare systems with famine and poverty.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War  The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War began in April 1898 and ended in August 1898. During this time the United States gained control of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines from Spain. As a military police power and as colonizers the United States took a very hands-on approach in administering healthcare particularly vaccinations to natives during the invasion and conquest of these countries. Although the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War occurred during the era of \\"bacteriological revolution\\" where knowledge of disease was bolstered by germ theory, more than half of the soldier casualties in this war were from disease. Unknowingly, American soldiers acted as agents of disease transmission, fostering bacteria in their haphazardly made camps. These soldiers invaded Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines and connected parts of these countries that had never before been connected due to the countries sparse nature thereby beginning epidemics. The mobility of American soldiers around these countries encouraged a newfound mobility of disease that quickly infected natives. Military personnel used Rudyard's Kipling's poem \\"The White Man's Burden\\" to explain their imperialistic actions in Cuba, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico and the need for the United States to help the \\"dark-skinned Barbarians\\" reach modern sanitary standards. American actions abroad before, during, and after the war emphasized a need for proper sanitation habits especially on behalf of the natives. Natives who refuse to oblige with American health standards and procedures risked fines or imprisonment. One penalty in Puerto Rico included a $10 fine for a failure to vaccinate and an additional $5 fine for any day you continue to be unvaccinated, refusal to pay resulted in ten or more days of imprisonment. If entire villages refused the army's current sanitation policy at any given time they risked being burnt to the ground in order to preserve the health and safety of soldiers from endemic smallpox and yellow fever. Vaccines were forcibly administered to the Puerto Ricans, Cubans, and Filipinos. Military personnel in Puerto Rico provided Public Health services that culminated in military orders that mandated vaccinations for children before they were six months old, as well as a general vaccination order. By the end of 1899 in Puerto Rico alone the U.S. military and other hired native vaccinators called practicantes, vaccinated an estimated 860,000 natives in a five-month period. This period began the United States' movement toward an expansion of medical practices that included \\"tropical medicine\\" in an attempt to protect the lives of soldiers abroad. Adverse event reporting There are several programs for monitoring the safety of vaccines in the United States. Chief among these is the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is co-managed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS is a postmarketing surveillance program, collecting information about adverse events (possible harmful side effects) that occur after administration of vaccines to ascertain whether the risk‚Äìbenefit ratio is high enough to justify continued use of any particular vaccine. In addition to VAERS, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, and the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Network are tools by which the CDC and FDA measure vaccine safety. Vaccine injury compensation The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP or NVICP) was established pursuant to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), passed by the United States Congress in response to a threat to the vaccine supply due to a 1980s scare over the DPT vaccine. Despite the belief of most public health officials that claims of side effects were unfounded, large jury awards had been given to some plaintiffs, most DPT vaccine makers had ceased production, and officials feared the loss of herd immunity. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services set up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) in 1988 to compensate individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines. The Office of Special Masters of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, popularly known as \\"vaccine court\\", administers a no-fault system for litigating vaccine injury claims. These claims against vaccine manufacturers cannot normally be filed in state or federal civil courts, but instead must be heard in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, sitting without a jury. Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims. Since 1988, the program has been funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a causal connection. The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not. Denied claims can be pursued in civil courts, though this is rare. The VICP covers all vaccines listed on the Vaccine Injury Table maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; in 2007 the list included vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), Haemophilus influenzae type b, rotavirus, and pneumonia. From 1988 until 8 January 2008, 5,263 claims relating to autism, and 2,865 non-autism claims, were made to the VICP. 925 of these claims, one autism-related (see previous rulings), were compensated, with 1,158 non-autism and 350 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled $847 million. As of October 2019, $4.2 Billion in compensation (not including attorneys fees and costs) has been awarded over the forty-three year history of the program.

The engagement occurred during the build-up to formal beginning of the First English Civil War on 22 August, while the Royalists and Parliamentarians were recruiting men in the county. The Royalists had established their regional headquarters in Wells, but were threatened by superior Parliamentarian numbers in the vicinity. The Royalist commander sent out a mounted patrol consisting of 60 to 80 cavalry and dragoons, which came across a force of between 500 and 600 Parliamentarian recruits travelling north across the Somerset Levels under the command of Sir John Pyne. The Royalists set an ambush at Marshall's Elm, where the road rose out of the Levels into the Polden Hills. After a parley between the leaders was unsuccessful, the Parliamentarians were caught in the ambush. Facing musket fire from the hidden dragoons, and being charged at by the Royalist cavalry, they were routed. The Royalists killed around 27, and took 60 prisoners, including two of the Parliamentarian officers. Despite their victory, the Royalists were forced to withdraw from Wells, and later from Somerset altogether, due to their inferior numbers. Background Conflict between the English Parliament and its monarch on religious, fiscal and legislative matters had been ongoing since at least 1603. The tension between Parliament and King Charles escalated sharply during 1642 after the King had attempted to arrest five Members of Parliament, who he accused of treason. In preparation for the likelihood of conflict with Parliament, Charles appointed the Marquess of Hertford as commander of his forces in the West Country, supported by Sir Ralph Hopton, a local Member of Parliament (MP) and an experienced army officer. Both sides were attempting to recruit the existing militia and new men into their armies. Parliament passed the Militia Ordinance in March 1642 without royal assent, granting themselves control of the militia. In response, Charles granted commissions of array to his commanders, a medieval device for levying soldiers which had not been used since 1557. One such commission was issued to Hertford, for the levying of troops in south- west England and south Wales. Hertford chose Wells in Somerset as the Royalists' headquarters in the West Country, and they arrived in the city on 28 July. The decision was based on the fact that Wells housed the county magazine, had Royalist sympathies, and was geographically central within the area. In his 1973 book, Somerset in the Civil War, the historian David Underdown criticises the decision, citing Wells' vulnerable position in the Mendip Hills, and the strong Parliamentarian views held by the majority of Somerset's rural population. Hopton had previously acted as one of the deputy lieutenants for Somerset, making him responsible for training and leading the county's militia. Hopton's standing helped the Royalists' recruiting, but the general population of the county, many of whom were Calvinist Protestants, or worked in industries depressed by royal policies, was more sympathetic towards Parliament than the King. Broadly speaking, the Royalists were more successful in recruiting cavalry and members of the gentry; Hopton, John Digby and Francis Hawley each brought a troop of horse, but attempts to raise an infantry regiment were unsuccessful. In contrast, the Parliamentarians signed up more men, but many of these were untrained and unarmed countrymen. On 30 July 1642, the Parliamentarians, led by William Strode, one of Parliament's deputy lieutenants in Somerset, held a meeting to collect arms at Shepton Mallet, around east-southeast of Wells. Hertford sent Hopton with his cavalry to Shepton on 1 August to confront the Parliamentarians, but he had orders to avoid conflict. When Hopton arrived in Shepton, Strode refused to listen to him, and the two scuffled. A crowd of over 1,000 had gathered, and Hopton withdrew and rejoined his cavalry outside the town. There, the Royalists and the countrymen sympathetic to the Parliamentarians faced off without fighting for several hours before the Royalists pulled back to Wells. Prelude Parliamentarian force approached from the left, while the Royalists positioned themselves on the hills.alt=A grassy hill with trees in the background. The hill falls away steeply to the left of the image, and less so to the right. The success of the Parliamentarians' recruiting left the Royalists in danger of being surrounded in Wells. Sir John Pyne, an MP who had also been appointed as a deputy lieutenant of Somerset by Parliament in March, and Captain John Preston recruited around 400 men from Taunton (around south-west of Wells), while Captain Sands brought a further 200 from South Petherton. Pyne had orders to bring the men, described as \\"a few hundred farmers\\" by Underdown, to Street, where they would rendezvous with Strode. Hertford was wary of his weak position, and on 4 August he sent a mounted patrol out under the command of Sir John Stawell, composed of three troops of cavalry and some dragoons, numbering around 60 to 80 in all. The patrol, which also included several of the Royalist gentry and the experienced soldier Henry Lunsford, rode south through Glastonbury into the Polden Hills. On reaching the village of Marshall's Elm, just over south of Street, and around south of Wells, the patrol spotted Pyne's force marching through cornfields about away. Battle Having approached from the north, the Royalists had the advantage of higher ground, coming down off the Poldens. Marshall's Elm is located in a depression that acted as a pass between Ivy Thorn Hill and Collard Hill, where the road rose out of the Somerset Levels to climb into the hills. Stawell parleyed with the Parliamentarians, telling them that they could avoid conflict if they aborted their march, but to no effect. While Stawell was engaged in his discussion with the Parliamentarians, Lunsford arranged the Royalist troops; the cavalry were behind the brow of the hill, leaving just their heads and weapons visible, to disguise their numbers; fourteen dragoons dismounted and were hidden in quarry pits lower on the hill by the road. He ordered all the men to hold their fire until he led the attack with the dragoons. Pyne initially continued the Parliamentarian march, but then changed his mind. His order to stop was met with complaints from his men, who said that the Royalist force \\"were but a few horse and would run away\\", and they continued up the hill. Pyne's men halted occasionally to fire, but Lunsford held the Royalists' fire until the enemy were within 120 paces, when the dragoons returned fire with their muskets and killed the leader of the Parliamentarian vanguard. The Parliamentarians hesitated, unsure of where the attack had come from, and Stawell led the cavalry charge down the hill. The Parliamentarians were routed; seven were killed at Marshall's Elm, and the Royalists chased some of the fleeing men for , as far as Somerton. They captured sixty prisoners, who they left in Somerton. Among those captured were the two officers, Preston and Sands. As well as the seven killed at the battle, roughly another twenty died of their wounds. Aftermath The battle provided both a tactical and strategic victory for the Royalists, leaving Hertford with an escape route from Wells should it be needed. Underdown credits their cavalry strength and leadership for the victory, highlighting that their leaders were \\"accustomed to command and confident of their ability to defeat larger forces of poorly officered farmers\\". He was particularly complimentary of Lunsford, and the experience he brought. One of the region's Parliamentarian leaders, John Ashe, said that the battle \\"very much daunted the honest countryman\\". Despite their defeat at Marshall's Elm, the Parliamentarians continued to gather men around Wells. Groups congregated from Bristol, Gloucester, Wiltshire and throughout north-east Somerset; a range of cavalry, musketeers and countrymen wielding makeshift weapons such as pitchforks. The force, which numbered around 12,000, crossed the Mendip Hills and reached a slope overlooking Wells on the evening of 5 August. Pyne held joint command of part of the force with Strode. Hertford sent his cavalry to face them, and both groups agreed to a ceasefire until the next day. Overnight, the Parliamentarians' numbers were swelled by further recruits and reinforcements, and Hertford made a sham of negotiating in the morning to cover his retreat; while the Parliamentarian messengers were riding north out of Wells with his 'offer', his men fled south, covered by a cavalry rearguard led by Hopton. After spending two nights in Somerton, the Royalists withdrew out of Somerset altogether, garrisoning Sherborne Castle in Dorset. The First English Civil War formally began on 22 August, when Charles I raised his royal standard in Nottingham. The battle at Marshall's Elm was not the only engagement to predate the formal start of the war, but the historian Peter Gaunt suggests that it was the bloodiest, while another, Charles Carlton, said that Marshall's Elm was the \\"first real confrontation\\" of the war.

The first modern studies on Cyril and Methodius date from the late 18th century, with the discipline becoming somewhat classic in the 19th century. The main research topics of the discipline are the emergence and spread of Glagolitic and Cyrillic. In this connection the questions about their authorship (the life and work of Cyril and Methodius and the so-called five Apostles of the First Bulgarian Empire among their students and all of them canonized as Seven Saints), the exact time and place of creation, the schedule, the authenticity of the artistic sources, the nature of the liturgy during their missions. The historical sources of Cyril and Methodius are mainly Old Bulgarian and Latin. The historical period on which the excavations are concentrated is the middle of the IX century - the end of the XII century / the beginning of the XIII century. During this period, the so-called Old Church Slavonic language or literary Old Bulgarian language was created and approved. In the following period, Croatian Glagolitic, Serbian Cyrillic and Ancient Russian Cyrillic - specific script and literacy were formed respectively, other than Old Bulgarian. The subsequent period in the development of the Bulgarian language is referred to as Middle Bulgarian or Middle Bulgarian language. –ò–∑—Å–ª–µ–¥–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ –∫–∏—Ä–∏–ª–æ–º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–∏–µ–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞, –∏–∑–¥. ‚Äû–ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ‚Äú, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1985, —Å—Ç—Ä. 192-193; –†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–æ–±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—è –µ–∑–∏–∫ –æ—Ç –ê–Ω–Ω–∞-–ú–∞—Ä–∏—è –¢–æ—Ç–æ–º–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞: –ß–µ—à–∫–∞, —Å–ª–æ–≤–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞, —Ä—É—Å–∫–∞, —Å—Ä—ä–±—Å–∫–∞ –∏ —Ö—ä—Ä–≤–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∞, –∫–∞—Ç–æ —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω—ä—Ç ‚Äû—Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è‚Äú —Å–µ —É–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±—è–≤–∞ –∏ –≤ —Å–º–∏—Å—ä–ª –Ω–∞ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è, –∞ –∫–∞—Ç–æ —Å–∏–Ω–æ–Ω–∏–º –Ω–∞ –µ–∑–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è —á–µ—Å—Ç–æ —Å–µ –∏–∑–ø–æ–ª–∑–≤–∞ —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω—ä—Ç ‚Äû–∏–∑–≤–æ–¥‚Äú. –ù—è–∫–æ–∏ —Å–ª–∞–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏ —É–ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±—è–≤–∞—Ç —Ç–µ—Ä–º–∏–Ω—ä—Ç ‚Äû—Ä–µ—Ü–µ–Ω–∑–∏—è‚Äú –≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—á–Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏—è.

When passing \\"Go\\", female players get $240, while male players only get the standard $200 as in the normal game. In addition, the game differs from regular Monopoly in that properties are replaced by inventions women created or contributed to, including Wi-Fi, to which Hedy Lamarr and Radia Perlman contributed; modern shapewear by Spanx founder Sara Blakely; and chocolate chip cookies, invented by Ruth Graves Wakefield. Tokens have been replaced with new ones: a notebook and pen, a jet, a glass, a watch, a barbell, and Ms. Monopoly's white hat. Chance and Community Chest cards also provide different payouts for men and women. Sometimes the payout is higher for women and sometimes for men. Jail and luxury taxes are maintained from the regular game. The game replaces Rich Uncle Pennybags, the mascot on most Monopoly versions, with a young woman described as his niece. As part of the game's rollout, Hasbro sent three teenage girls a grant of $20,580 each to invest in their own inventions. Hasbro promoted Ms. Monopoly as the first game \\"where women make more than men\\". In a statement, Hasbro said that the game provides an environment in which \\"women have an advantage often enjoyed by men\\". Reception Reception towards Ms. Monopoly was generally negative upon its announcement. Eric Thurm, author of \\"Avidly Reads: Board Games\\", said the game created a \\"surface-level fantasy world\\" where women succeed simply because of their gender. Madeleine Kearns of National Review called it \\"patronizing pointlessness\\". Queens College's philosophy department head Christine Sypnowich said it was \\"unhelpful to portray women as needing special advantages.\\" Jennifer Borda, an associate professor specializing in feminist studies at the University of New Hampshire, suggested that it would be more suitable if male players instead faced challenges women face in the workplace. Mary Pilon, author of The Monopolists, criticized the game for failing to recognize Lizzie Magie, who invented The Landlord's Game, the precursor to Monopoly.

In order to preserve peace, especially in the commercial and economic hub of Shanghai, Qi and Lu negotiated. Shanghai signed bilateral non-aggression treaties with Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. Furthermore, in August 1923, Qi and Lu signed an agreement to not take allies, to not allow any other warlord armies to pass through their provinces, and to not augment their own armies.Mao Jinling, \\"Beiyang\\", p. 104-105Dongfang Zazhi 20 (August 10, 1923) no. 15, p. 2-4North China Herald, (August 25, 1923) However, on September 3, 1924, Qi Xieyuan went to war with Lu Yongxiang over the absorption of a warlord army, breaking their agreement, thus beginning the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War.Ibid., p. 105 With the support of Fujian governor Sun Chuanfang, Qi Xieyuan successfully defeated Lu Yongxiang, delivering him a crushing defeat at Shanghai. However, the Jiangsu- Zhejiang War had sparked the Second Zhili‚ÄìFengtian War, which saw the Zhili clique declaring war on the Northern Fengtian clique, who had, since their first war with the Zhili, built up their forces and equipment.Gavan McCormack, \\"Chang Tso-lin in Northeast China, 1911-1928: China, Japan, and the Manchurian Ideal\\", (1977), p. 107 The Fengtian clique had sent General Zhang Zongchang South, leading to Sun and Qi proclaiming the Jiangsu‚ÄìZhejiang Allied Army to resist him. However, Sun was encircled by the army of Duan Qirui (Anhui clique), and abandoned Qi. Qi, cut off from Sun, was defeated and dismissed, later moving to Japan.

Founded by Amos Sumane in 1974 or 1976, the PRM was strongly opposed to Mozambique's FRELIMO government and its communist ideology. The party waged a low-level insurgency in the provinces of Zambezia, Tete and Niassa from 1977. Sumane was captured in 1980 and executed by the Mozambican government in 1981. The PRM's leadership passed to Gimo Phiri under whom the party merged with another rebel group, RENAMO, in 1982.  Etymology  The Revolutionary Party of Mozambique was also known as Revolucion√°rio de For√ßas Mo√ßambique and √Åfrica Livre (\\"Free Africa\\"). According to historian S√©rgio In√°cio Chichava, the PRM and √Åfrica Livre were often conflated. The name √Åfrica Livre originates from the radio station Voz da √Åfrica Livre (Voice of Free Africa) created by the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organisation to broadcast anti-FRELIMO propanganda. Those listening began to regard reports from the station detailing attacks against FRELIMO targets as part of an √Åfrica Livre movement. PRM leader Gimo Phiri stated in interview that √Åfrica Livre did not refer to an actual organization but served as a collective term for all anti-FRELIMO groups in Zambezia. Accordingly, a variety of minor anti-FRELIMO movements in northern Mozambique, including Sagwati, Maramara, Nharene, Involiwa, and COREMO as well as UNAR remnants have been termed √Åfrica Livre.  History  = Foundation = President Hastings Banda (pictured) played a major role in supporting UNAR, a predecessor of the PRM. Several rebel groups, most importantly FRELIMO, fought against Portugal in the Mozambican War of Independence from 1964. One insurgent faction, the Mozambique Revolutionary Committee (COREMO), was active in northwestern Mozambique. It splintered in 1968 when its deputy president Amos Sumane broke off and founded the Rumbezi African National Union (UNAR). UNAR was primarily active in Zambezia Province, a region where FRELIMO had little popular support. Sumane's forces fought for the separation of \\"Rumbezia\\", the region between the Rovuma and Zambezi rivers, from Mozambique and its eventual unification with Malawi. FRELIMO claimed that UNAR was created by the Portuguese PIDE-DGS secret police and the Malawian government under President Hastings Banda. UNAR was short-lived, but Sumane remained active and forged close links to the Mozambican community in Malawi. The war of independence ended in 1974 with the Portuguese withdrawal from Mozambique, whereupon FRELIMO seized power in the country and marginalized other rebel forces. Some factions responded by founding RENAMO and launching a rebellion against the FRELIMO government, resulting in the Mozambican Civil War. Sumane also took up arms against FRELIMO, but opted to organize a separate rebel group known as Revolutionary Party of Mozambique (PRM) in 1974 or 1976. The group was described as successor or rebranding of UNAR, and was based in Malawi. According to researchers Jeremy W. Weinstein and Laudemiro Francisco, the PRM was founded with \\"active Malawian support\\". Paul Favert noted that former PIDE Mozambican operatives exiled in Malawi acted in concert with Sumane to organise cross-border attacks. Historian David Hedges specifically regarded Jorge Jardim, a Portuguese businessman, as one of the PRM's main instigators and supporters. = Insurgency = The PRM managed to attract a significant following among the rural population of northern Mozambique. Parts of the region such as Milange District had a long history of banditry, and many local armed groups were opposed to FRELIMO. Militants in northern Mozambique included peasant rebels, remnants of earlier separatist factions, \\"externally sponsored destabilization forces\\", and regular criminals. The PRM absorbed former COREMO elements, and the remnants of \\"Rumbezia separatist\\" groups, most importantly local branches of UNAR. Sumane's force mostly recruited ethnic Lomu√© tribesmen who had suffered economically due to the collapse of the regional plantation economy, and had been marginalized by FRELIMO's rural modernization policies such as the establishment of communal villages. The PRM consequently regarded the FRELIMO-organized communal villages as primary target, but also attacked other government-associated locations such as \\"People's Shops\\", party offices, local branches of FRELIMO mass organizations, homes of officials, and police stations. The PRM's political commissar Gimo Phiri would later claim that the group's first attack on FRELIMO troops took place at Jalasse in Zambezia Province on 8 August 1978. In spite of this claim, there were reports of PRM already waging a low-level insurgency in Tete and Niassa Provinces by 1977. From its foundation, the PRM suffered from a lack of adequate weaponry; it was forced to use sticks, axes, machetes, and spears in combat. In order to get access to guns, the group had to capture them from FRELIMO troops. The Mozambican government initially regarded the PRM as mere bandits, though admitted that they enjoyed some support from locals in Zambezia Province. After its first attacks, the PRM gradually grew in numbers and expanded its operations. It forged alliances with the rural population including tribal chiefs, infiltrated FRELIMO's women's league, and had contacts in Malawi. By 1979, the group was active in Milange, Guru√©, Namarroi, Lugela, and Mecanhelas Districts. In course of 1980, the PRM took control of much of Milange, and many local government representatives defected to the insurgents. Around the same time, the Malawian government began to normalize its relations with the FRELIMO government of Mozambique, and pleged to prevent cross-border attacks by Mozambican rebels. It proved to be unable to fulfill this pledge. The Malawian government did not fully control \\"its own state apparatus\\", and consequently did not expel the PRM. As the PRM became more active, the Mozambican government began to take the rebels more seriously, and intensified its counter-insurgency operations. Its agents abducted Sumane from Blantyre in Malawi around 1980; he was executed in 1981. Other prominent PRM members such as Joaquim Veleia, Matias Tenda, and Lucas Saguate were also killed. Despite these setbacks, the PRM's insurgency and cross-border attacks continued. Phiri was appointed as Sumane's successor, and the party even expanded its operations in Zambezia, Tete, and Niassa under his leadership. David Hedges argued that the PRM's partial resurgence stemmed from support by South Africa, channeled through Malawi. The Mozambican government increasingly pressured Malawi to suppress PRM activity, whereupon 18 PRM members were arrested and extradited to Mozambique on 26 January 1981. One of the main PRM areas of activity was the rural Milange District (savanna in Milange pictured) By 1982, the group was launching raids near Lake Amaramba and in Mutarara District. On 20 September 1982, the PRM destroyed Muabanama, the only communal village of Lugela District. This event \\"reduced to nothing the achievement\\" of local government policies, as Muabanama had acted as pioneer project for the region. The PRM's campaign greatly hindered the implemention of FRELIMO's communal village system. The Mozambican government eventually resorted to forcing people to relocate to communal villages in some areas such as Milange District, hoping that this would isolate the rural population from the rebels. Despite this, the PRM's actual military successes were limited, and it remained resource-poor. RENAMO fighters who operated alongside PRM militants later claimed that the latter resorted to \\"rudimentary\\" tactics and were \\"mainly relying on stones\\" to fight the Mozambican government. = Merger with RENAMO and legacy = In mid-1982, RENAMO contacted the PRM with an offer to merge their forces. RENAMO representative Khembo dos Santos met with Gimo Phiri in Malawi, but their first talks were inconclusive. The PRM had previously requested assistance from RENAMO, but never received any. This resulted in doubts about the honesty of the merger proposals. Negotiations continued, and RENAMO entered Zambezia Province to fight alongside the PRM against FRELIMO in August 1982. The PRM officially agreed to merge during a conference at a camp on Mount Namuli, and consequently provided the core for RENAMO's presence in Zambezia. According to researcher William Finnegan, the merger was facilitated by RENAMO's South African allies with the purpose of opening a northern front against FRELIMO. Phiri rose to a senior leadership position under RENAMO chief Afonso Dhlakama. His followers were distributed to three RENAMO bases in Zambezia, and provided with much-needed weaponry. As result of leadership struggles, tribal disputes, and policy disagreements in RENAMO, Phiri and about 500 followers broke off in late 1987 or early 1988, founding the Mozambican National Union (UNAMO) ostensibly in honor of Sumane. Phiri's troops consequently waged their own low-level insurgency, clashing with RENAMO loyalists and FRELIMO along Malawi's southeastern border. This marked the only major split of RENAMO during the civil war. According to researchers Weinstein and Francisco, Phiri believed that he could compete with RENAMO using his past experience as independent commander and the weaponry which his forces had gained through the merger. He hoped to replenish his stockpiles by capturing weapons from the government, and through external support. Regardless, UNAMO's insurgency was short-lived. Phiri was unable to gain foreign backers, and the costs of maintaining his troops were \\"far too high\\". UNAMO began to occasionally ally with FRELIMO to defeat RENAMO forces, and Phiri agreed to join sides with the Mozambican government in 1988. UNAMO organized the so-called \\"Maria Group\\" to patrol certain areas in Zambezia, and fought for FRELIMO for the rest of the civil war. The UNAMO fighters were demobilized as part of the General Peace Agreement (AGP). After the civil war's end, UNAMO was legalized and took part in the elections. However, its leader Phiri was deposed during internal party struggles, and subsequently founded the Democratic Union of Mozambique (Udemo) in protest. The Mozambican government also renegaded on the promises made to him during the civil war. In response, Phiri threatened to start a new insurgency in 1996, but this was just a bluff. He subsequently became politically insignificant.  Organization, ideology, and tactics  anti- communist and opposed to FRELIMO's left-wing policies (pictured: Soviet stamp commemorating FRELIMO) The PRM was led by Amos Sumane, an ex-member of FRELIMO and COREMO, until his capture and execution by the Mozambican government. He was succeeded by Gimo Phiri, a native of Mutarara District. Besides Sumane and Phiri, Lucas Saguate served as one of the group's main commanders. The PRM claimed to fight for \\"true independence, democracy, development, freedom of worship\\", and regarded FRELIMO as authoritarian as well as tribalist. The group was anti-communist and consequently opposed to FRELIMO's government policies such as the communal villages and \\"people's shops\\". These were targeted by the PRM as part of the \\"wotcha weka\\" (translated \\"I will burn you myself\\") tactics: Militants of the group entered communal villages, fired into the air, and then \\"organised\\" the locals to burn the settlements and return to their original homes. Phiri argued that \\"wotcha weka\\" was done in benefit of the rural population. According to researcher S√©rgio Chichava, many peasants were actually dissatisfied with the communal villages and supported the PRM; others destroyed their settlements out of fear of reprisals by the insurgents. The destruction of communal villages was a generally effective strategy, as it not just exploited anti-FRELIMO sentiments of civilians, but also separated the population from government influence. The PRM actually contributed to the failure of the communal village system in northern Mozambique. In its insurgency, the PRM often used stolen uniforms to disguise its members as government agents and police officers. It was thus able to infiltrate locations and carry out surprise attacks. Furthermore, the group enlisted militias of traditional chiefs as auxiliaries to bolster its numbers.

Built in the 15th century, the structure served as a royal tomb for members of the Timurid dynasty and is part of the Musalla Complex. Description The mausoleum forms a cruciform shape, with a dome covering the centre. This dome is the most impressive feature of the structure, in that it is actually three domes superimposed over one another: a low inner dome, a bulbous outer cupola and a structural dome between them. The outer cupola is decorated with flowery light-blue-green mosaics. The inner dome is adorned with gold leaf, lapis lazuli and other colours which form intricate patterns. The interior of the tomb itself is a square chamber with axial niches. Due to the widespread habit of tombstones being taken and re-used, it is unknown how many burials there are in the mausoleum. Though some sources claim there were as many as twenty grave markers at one time, at present there are only six. These are oblong shaped and made of matt black stone, with floral patterns carved on them. History The mausoleum was originally constructed to house the remains of Prince Baysunghur, a son of the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh by his chief wife Gawhar Shad. It was commissioned by the latter (for whom it is named) within a madrassah which also bore her name and was completed in 1438. Its location in the Musalla Complex was convenient due to the close vicinity to the royal residence in the Bagh-i Zaghan. As such, over the following years, further members of Baysunghur's family were interred alongside him. These include Gawhar Shad herself and her brother Amir Sufi Tarkhan, her other son Muhammad Juki, Baysunghur's sons Sultan Muhammad and Ala al-Dawla, as well as the latter's son Ibrahim. More distantly related Timurids, Ahmad and Shah Rukh (sons of Abu Sa'id Mirza), were also buried in the mausoleum. Baysunghur's father was briefly interred as well, before later being transferred to the Gur-e-Amir in Samarqand. By the 20th century, the mausoleum had been extensively damaged, with the cupola in particular being severely deteriorated. Intervention in the 1950s resulted in drastically changing the appearance of the building, with an entirely new eastern fa√ßade being built and the hexagonal Mihrab being demolished and replaced with a rectangular one. This, along with later restorations, were of poor quality and used inappropriate materials. In 2014, UNESCO and the Afghanistan government coordinated to attempt to preserve and replicate the tile work on the exterior dome. UNESCO is presently considering the nomination of Herat (in which the mausoleum is specifically mentioned) as a World Heritage Site.

Engraving by John Martyn in the December 1803 issue. The magazine had high production values, with regular illustrations and sometimes sheet music. It gave early encouragement to Thomas Moore. According to Tom Clyde, \\"very little of the creative writing is worth reading\\"; it often featured Orientalism and rarely Romanticism. Much of the non-Irish material was reprinted from the European Magazine. In 1883 C. J. Hamilton wrote: :What the Gentleman's Magazine was to England, Walker's Hibernian Magazine was to Ireland during the latter half of the eighteenth century. It has, perhaps, a more marked individuality of character and a stronger flavour of provincialism than the Gentleman's, and for these causes suits the curiosity-monger even better. It was at once a newspaper and a monthly miscellany of useful and entertaining literature. It not only gave parliamentary debates and the latest births, deaths, and marriages, but also tit-bits of London and Dublin gossip, the newest outrages, the most thrilling sentimental tales √† la Werther, along with scraps of poetry and t√™te-√†-t√™te portraits of the leading fashionable belles and beaux of the day. Up to about 1795, the magazine showed sympathy for women's rights and Catholic emancipation. Afterwards it became more reactionary in opposition to the United Irishmen.Clyde 2003 p.13 With the onset of the Napoleonic Wars, news and patriotic coverage crowded out cultural and antiquarian content.

History  Members of the Asheville Reading Club, including Anna C. Aston, Fannie Patton and Annie Chunn, began collecting books for a library in 1876. The Asheville Reading Club established the Asheville Library Association on January 25, 1879, and began operating a subscription library. In March 1894, the library moved to a new location at the corner of Church and Aston Streets; the collection contained 2,000 books and had a yearly subscription fee of $2.00. In 1899, George Willis Pack, a prominent local benefactor, donated a building to the Asheville Library Board to house the Asheville Public Library. The library was later renamed Pack Memorial Library in honor of its benefactor. On January 2, 1919, the library ended its subscription service and became a free public library. The original Pack building was replaced by a new building designed by Edward Tilton, which opened on July 9, 1926. The collection contained 18,500 volumes.Gillis, D. (1926).

French Revolutionary Legion Edmond-Charles Gen√™t, the French ambassador to the United States, created the French Revolutionary Legion in response to outrage against Spain. Gen√™t hoped to rally the ethnic French of the western United States, as well as traditional French allies among the Native American nations. Gen√™t sent Andr√© Michaux and two French artillery officers to Kentucky and commissioned George Rogers Clark as \\"Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River\\".English, 2:818 Clark began to organize a campaign to seize New Madrid, St. Louis, Natchez, and New Orleans, in Louisiana, in order to gain free navigation on the Mississippi River. Gen√™t dispatched the Little Democrat to establish a blockade at New Orleans. Clark won the tacit support of Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby,English, 2:821‚Äì22 who when pressed by the Washington administration to arrest Clark, responded with doubts that he had \\"any legal authority to restrain or to punish them.\\" Thomas Jefferson officially protested the Legion's violation of U.S. neutrality, but suggested that the campaign would be in the best interests of the United States. Clark advertised in the Centinel of the Northwest Territory that anyone who served with the French Legion would be granted 1,000 to 3,000 acres of conquered lands, depending on the years of service; and all plunder would be divided. Clark was able to raise two infantry regiments, and was prepared to launch his campaign when it was cancelled by another French official. President George Washington was angered by Gen√™t's lack of diplomatic tact, and demanded his recall in December 1793. In February 1794, a new ambassador from France, Jean Antoine Joseph Fauchet, arrived in Philadelphia with an arrest warrant for Gen√™t. On March 4, Fauchet issued an order cancelling the expedition into Louisiana. Clark and Shelby continued their preparations, however, so President Washington issued a Proclamation of Neutrality on March 24 which forbid Americans from invading Spain. On March 31, Secretary of War Henry Knox ordered General Anthony Wayne to build a fortification on the site of Fort Massac to stop the expedition. Wayne sent a company of infantry and some artillery to Fort Massac in May after receiving word that Spain had sent five gunboats up the Mississippi to the Ohio River. The French government revoked the commissions granted to the Americans for the war against Spain. By July, the French Revolutionary Legion had dispersed. Clark's planned campaign collapsed, and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses. Brigadier General James Wilkinson, 2nd in command of the Legion of the United States, claimed credit for undermining Clark and for preventing supplies from being shipped down the Ohio River. He submitted receipts of $8,640 to Spanish Governor Carondelet for his efforts. France issued a new commission to Clark in 1796. The plan to invade Louisiana was revisited in 1798, but failed to yield any results. The French First Republic, under Napoleon Bonaparte, gained possession of the territory in the 1800 Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. It was purchased by the United States in 1803. American Revolutionary Legion In October 1793, a similar force was raised in South Carolina. French Consul Michel Ange Bernard Mangourit wanted to capture Florida from Spain and then assist Clark in the invasion of Louisiana. He commissioned William Tate as a French Colonel to lead this force. Tate's deputy commander was Stephen Drayton, the personal secretary to Governor William Moultrie. Tate was instructed to recruit from outside the United States, but he recruited from the region of the Carolinas, especially rural settlers. He is known to have attracted sixty-six officers, but claimed to have raised more than 2,000 volunteers. Like Clark, Tate's commission was rescinded by Fauchet. South Carolina threatened to arrest Tate for treason, and he fled to France in 1795, where he commanded the L√©gion Noire in the 1797 Battle of Fishguard.

(H. heilmani s.s.) is a species within the Helicobacter genus of Gram negative bacteria. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is by far the best known Helicobacter species primarily because humans infected with it may develop gastrointestinal tract diseases such as stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, doudenal ulcers, stomach cancers of the non- lymphoma type, and various subtypes of extranodal marginal zone lymphomass, e.g. those of the stomach, small intestines, large intestines, and rectumn. H. pylori is also associated with the development of bile duct cancer and has been associated with a wide range of other diseases although its role in the development of many of these other diseases requires further study. Humans infected with H. heilmannii s.s. may develop some of the same gastrointestinal diseases viz., stomach inflammation, stomach ulcers, duodenum ulcers, stomach cancers that are not lymphomas, and extranodal marginal B cell lymphomas of the stomach. Other non-H. pylori Helicobacter species that are known to be associated with these gastrointestinal diseases are Helicobacter bizzozeronii, Helicobacter suis, Helicobacter felis, and Helicobacter salomonis. Because of their disease associations, these four Helicobacter species plus H. heilmannii s.s. are often group together and termed Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato. (Helicobacter heilmannii s.s. is used to designate a specific species within the Helicobacter heilmanii group; \\"s.s\\" is appended to its name in order to distinguish it from the Helicobacter heilmannii group.) H. heilmanni s.s. bacteria are detected in the stomachs of their natural hosts viz., cats, dogs, foxes, lynxes, and non-human primates. Reports suggest that individuals, including children, are infected with this bacterium by having close contact with one of these animals: H. heilmanni s.l.-associated diseases, including those associated with H. heilmani s.s., appear to be zoonotic diseases, i.e. infectious diseases that are caused or promoted by a pathogen(s) that spreads from animals to humans. It is important to diagnose H. heilmanni as well as the other Helicobacter heilmannii sensu lato infections in patients with the cited upper gastrointestinal tract diseases, including in particular extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the stomach, because some of them have been successfully treated and cured using antibiotic-based drug regimens (e.g.amoxicillin, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor such as lansoprazole, or metronidazole, clarithromycin, plus a proton pump inhibitor) directed against the instigating bacterium.

The protests commenced as peaceful gatherings on the evening of 15 November but spread to 21 cities within hours, as videos of the protest circulated online, eventually becoming the most violent and severe anti-government unrest since the rise of Iran's Islamic Republic in 1979. To block the sharing of information regarding the protests and the deaths of hundreds of protesters on social media platforms, the government shut down the Internet nationwide, resulting in a near-total internet blackout of around six days. In an effort to crush the protests the Iranian government, (according to Amnesty international), shot protesters dead from rooftops, helicopters, and at close range with machine gun fire. In an effort to mask the scale and casualty count of the protests, it hauled away large numbers of bodies of the dead protesters, (according to the New York Times) and threatened families of slain protesters not to speak to the media or hold funerals, (according to Amnesty International). As many as 1,500 Iranian protesters were killed. The government crackdown prompted a violent reaction from protesters who destroyed 731 government banks including Iran's central bank, nine Islamic religious centres, tore down anti-American billboards, and posters and statues of the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as well as former leader Khomeini. Fifty government military bases were also attacked by protesters. The uprising differed from earlier 2009 protests in not being limited to students and large cities, and in the speed, severity and higher death toll of the government crackdown, which crushed the uprising in three days, although protests flared up periodically in the months after.  Background  Iran has experienced numerous nationwide protests and civil unrest since 2016, including the 2016 Cyrus the Great Revolt, 2017‚Äì2018 Iranian protests, 2018‚Äì2019 Iranian general strikes and protests, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 protests (in January 2020). Sanctions by the United States and the European Union, coupled with economic mismanagement, were factors involved in a severe economic crisis in Iran in the 2010s. Multiple protests and strikes took place in Iran in December 2017, throughout 2018 and in the first half of 2019. Protest causes ranged from rising prices to teachers' and railway workers' rights. Prior to the November 2019 cycle of unrest, the President of Iran Hassan Rouhani said, \\"Iran is experiencing one of its hardest years since the 1979 Islamic revolution\\". Rapid inflation which sent an additional 1.6 million Iranians into poverty in just a single year prior to the November 2019 protest. One of the grievances of the protesters was thought to be the privileges of the Islamic Republic's elite. During this time of economic hardship, a decree issued by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei exempted some trustees from paying taxes. They included the giant organization Khatam al Anbiya Construction Headquarters, and many other smaller entities belonging to Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In September 2019, just two months before the uprising, a former member of Iran's Parliament, Behzad Nabavi, told an interviewer that the Razavi Economic Foundation (which is presided over by Khamenei), together with the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and the Ministry of Intelligence (MOIS), controls about 60% of the Iranian economy. None of these entities pay any taxes and no government organization is allowed to go through their books.Khamenei's Men Run REO, The Largest Economic Player In Eastern Iran In late 2019, anti-government protests took place in Iranian allies Lebanon and Iraq. The immediate cause of the protest was the increase in price of fuel, which was announced by the government at midnight on 15 November 2019. Prior to the price increase, drivers could buy up to each month for 10,000 Iranian rial per litre ($0.90 per US gallon). With the new price structure prices started at 15,000 rial per litre ($1.35 per US gallon) for the first , and rose to 30,000 per litre ($2.70 per US gallon) after that, a price increase of 50% to 200%. An Iranian state-television programme described these measures as a way to help fund the subsidies of around 60 million Iranians. Timeline =2019= November 2019 After the government announced the price increase in the early hours of 15 November, Iranians in various cities took to the streets to protest. One protester was reportedly killed in Sirjan after security forces opened fire. Other demonstrators in the city set fire to a gas station, and chanted \\"Rouhani, leave this country\\". Protesters in Ahvaz demanded that people boycott fuel and stop their cars in the middle of the road as a sign of protest. In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, demonstrators blocked traffic in the streets and highways, turning them into parking lots. Protesters gathered late into the night in Qods, a suburb of Tehran, and destroyed a police vehicle. Protests were peaceful at first, as was the state response. Protests continued to expand for a second day on 16 November. Demonstrators gathered in over 50 cities and many major cities such as Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Shiraz to protest the sudden price hike. Security forces shot at protesters with live bullets in an effort to disperse them, killing at least ten protesters in Isfahan, Behbahan, Kermanshah, Karaj, and Shiraz. Several banks in Eslamshahr, Behbahan, and Tehran, and one religious school in Isfahan were burned down by protesters. In Shahriar demonstrators burned down a monument depicting the ring of the Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic. On 16 November, internet access across the country was reported to be in a near-total shutdown, with online activity estimated to be 7% of ordinary levels. State news agencies reported that over 1,000 people had been arrested by the 16th, and that the protests had spread to over 100 cities in Iran. Shop owners in Tehran and Isfahan closed the bazaars and went on strike in protest. While in Tabriz, students from the University of Tabriz left their classes and demonstrated at the university. Students at the University of Tehran gathered for a second day to protest on 16 November, the current situation in the country and chanted \\"Death to the dictator\\", and \\"Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life only for Iran\\". Protests continued in the Sadeghiyeh neighbourhood of Tehran, and the bazaar was packed with security forces attempting to prevent bazaar merchants from going on strike. Citizens of Tehran reported that despite the internet shutdown, the protests gathered in intensity on Tuesday. Heavy clashes were also reported in Shiraz, where the security forces fired directly at people. Authorities reported that nine Islamic seminaries and Friday prayer offices were burned by protesters across the country. Protests continued for a fifth consecutive day on 19 November despite a heavy security presence the country. Gatherings were reported in Tehran, Karaj, Shiraz and Isfahan. The city of Shush in Khuzestan province, was effectively closed down as Haft Tappeh workers protested the current conditions. The Revolutionary Guards reportedly took the bodies of the dead protesters and the injured in hospitals, to hide to cover up the true death toll and downplay the protests. In some cases, government officials sold the bodies of the protesters. The protests reached 70% of provinces according to The Guardian. On 21 November, Iran partially restored access to the internet. Residents of Tehran told the New York Times that the government had finished securing the northern area, but not the middle-class and working-class areas of the city. A 26 November Guardian editorial characterized the protests as \\"crushed\\". December 2019 On 7 December, coinciding with Students Day in Iran, students in Tehran and various other cities conducted demonstrations in support of the protests. In the early hours of 17 December, students at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran gathered outside the dormitories and protested the killing of protesters. On 25 December, the day before the 40th day mourning procession of the protesters killed in the November protests, security forces arrested several members of Pouya Bakhtiari's family. On 26 December 2019, security forces attacked different cemeteries around Iran to prevent the families, of those killed in November uprising, from holding ceremonies in honour of the 40th day of the death of their loved ones. Some of the mourners were arrested and taken away. One month after Iranian rulers fears any anti-government gathering. =2020= January 2020 Hafez Street, 11 January 2020 On 11 January 2020, after Iranian authorities had stated that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 had been shot down by Iranian military forces, killing all 176 passengers and flight personnel, three thousand people protested in Tehran, with chants including \\"Death to the dictator\\". Police used tear gas on the protestors. Officials reported that 82 Iranians among several other Iranians with dual citizenship were among the victims of the crash. Hundreds of people protested in front of Amirkabir University of Technology.\\"Hundreds protest against regime in Tehran after Iran admits it shot down plane\\", The Times of Israel, 11 January 2020. The protestors called for the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to resign, chanted \\"Death to the liars\\" and called \\"for the IRGC to leave the country\\". Protests also took place at the Sharif University of Technology and in Isfahan, Rasht, Sari, and Hamedan. Protesters chanted against the Revolutionary Guards, the Supreme Leader, and the entire political system of the Islamic Republic. On 12 January, similar protests took place around Iran. In the morning, students gathered at the dormitories of the University of Tehran and chanted against the Supreme Leader. There were around 3,000 participants in the main demonstration in Tehran according to the Iranian Labour News Agency. In online social media videos posted in the evening of a location near Azadi Square in Tehran, there were sounds of gunshots, pools of blood on the ground, wounded people being carried and security personnel with rifles. Hossein Rahimi of the Tehran police stated the following day that police had \\"been given orders to show restraint\\" and didn't shoot during the protests. The Iranian daily Etemad wrote \\"Apologise and resign\\" in a banner headline. The Iranian president described the missile attack as an unforgivable error. Protests continued in Tehran on 13 January, including 40 students at a Tehran university who chanted \\"They killed our elites and replaced them with clerics\\", in reference to the Iranian students who had died on flight AUI752. In the video surfacing on the internet, many Tehran university students openly refused to walk over the American and Israeli flags which was the symbol of the country's foreign policy of anti-Americanism and anti-Zionism since the inception of the Islamic Republic. The flags had been painted so that protesters would walk over them as they marched. On 14 January, students at various universities in Tehran, and other Iranian cities continued protesting against the regime and Ali Khamenei. At Amir Kabir University, protesters and the Basij clashed violently. Students at the University of Tehran chanted \\"We will die to reclaim Iran\\" and \\"Death to the concept of a [Supreme Leader]\\". On 15 January 2020 students in Isfahan and other Iranian cities held their 5th day of protests, after the government of Ayatollah Khamenei admitted downing the Ukrainian passenger plane. Students held banners showing 1500+176 meaning 176 innocent passengers was added to the 1500 killed in November uprising. On 16 January 2020, protesters planned to head down Valiasr Street to the IRIB headquarters in the capital city of Tehran, but were prevented by the heavy presence of in that street. Anti-riot police also took position in several other key points to prevent funeral gatherings for those killed in the missile attack on AUI752 flight. Nevertheless, many mourners attended the funerals. February 2020 On the 40th day anniversary of the Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 victims memorial at Amir Kabir University on 16 February, students chanted against the ruling system and called for the boycott of the 2020 parliamentary election. On 25 February 2020, a human rights center in Iran announced that a court in Iran sentenced five persons arrested during November uprising to different prison terms from 18 months to eleven years. The five detainees, who aged between 29 and 51 years, also received different number of lashes. The state court charged them with \\" collusion against national and international security\\" and \\"propaganda against the system\\".Iran Courts Sentence Five November Protesters To Total Thirty Years Prison The organization Human Rights Watch has called on the Geneva United Nations Human Rights Council to adopt \\"Urgent action\\" in regard to the \\"brutal crackdown\\" of the November protests in Iran. Michael Page, the organization's deputy director for the Middle East says, \\"Iranian authorities are now confronting popular protests with an astonishing level of violence\\".HRW Calls For Justice For Deadly Crackdown On Iranian Protesters July 2020 It is said that 237 protest movements were formed in 85 cities in Iran in July 2020. On 16 July 2020, amid a heavy security presence, protesters took to the streets of Behbehan and chanted \\"We don't want a clerical regime\\" and \\"Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life only for Iran\\". The security forces fired tear gas to disperse the protesters. A heavy security presence was also reported in various other Iranian cities. August 2020  September 2020  Internet Shutdown  On the eve of the protests, Iranian authorities started disrupting internet connections and social media. The Internet was effectively blocked following Iran's Supreme National Security Council decision to shut it down for 24 hours. Because of internet censorship in Iran, the Iranian government and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Sepah have always opposed joining Iranian to popular social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and so on. Therefore, popular social networks are blocked by those in Iran and because of Iranian protests, internet censorship in Iran has increased. But now they have decided to Internet blackout in Iran. NetBlocks reports that users first reported outages in Mashhad on 15 November. The disruptions increased in extent and severity with impact also visible on overall connectivity charts. Iran's largest mobile network operators, including MCI, Rightel and IranCell, were deactivated on the evening of 16 November 2019. By 20 November, national connectivity was at 5% of ordinary levels, making it difficult to monitor human rights violations and cover incidents on the ground. The government has also jammed satellite TV connections and sent anonymous messages to people near protest sites reading: ‚ÄúWe know you are here.‚Äù On 21 November 2019, a small return of connectivity was tracked by NetBlocks, along with reports that some users had returned online; national connectivity was up to 8%. Slogans and tactics Chants, banners and posters of demonstrators targeted the government and its leaders, and such pillars of the Islamic Republic ideology as pan-Islamic unity, anti- Zionist solidarity with Palestine and Hezbollah of Lebanon, reverence and awe for the Supreme Leader, and hatred for the Pahlavi dynasty. Many protest chants and slogans were directed at expressing discontent with the Iranian government's spending on conflicts in Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Other chants praised the late Shah of Iran calling for his return. =Slogans= In November 2019, people chanted, \\"Shah of Iran, return to Iran!\\", \\"Clerics must get lost\\", \\"No to Gaza, no to Lebanon. We sacrifice our lives for Iran,\\" \\"Death to the dictator\\", \\"Death to the Islamic Republic\\", \\"Our military brothers, why do you kill your brother?\\", \\"Bless your soul Reza Shah\\", \\"Not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life only for Iran\\", \\"Oil money has been lost, it has all been spent on Palestine\\", \\"They have brought up Islam, but trampled the people\\", \\"The supreme leader lives like a God. We, the people live like beggars.\\" \\"We have no money or fuel, to hell with Palestine.\\" Chants became even more radical in the January protests, with demonstrators calling for a revolution and chanting, \\"This is your last month, [Khamenei] it is time to go\\", \\"Clerics must get lost\\", \\"No reforms, no referendum, just strikes and revolution\\", \\"Sepah commits murders, and the Supreme Leader supports it\\", \\"You killed our elites, and replaced them with clerics\\", and \\"Death to Khamenei\\". = Tactics and methods = Protesters began by organizing rallies in protest of Iran's government resulting in police gunfire. As protests were met with government crackdowns, protesters began to block streets and highways, often parking their vehicles in the road. The protests intensified with Iranians burning pictures and banners of the supreme leader Ali Khamenei and burning government banks. According to the government, four of the security forces killed were shot even though civilians are \\"largely forbidden to have guns\\". =Support for former monarchy= One common protest slogan was \\"Oh Shah of Iran return to Iran.\\" Many protest chants praised the former Pahlavi Dynasty and its two leaders. Monarchist groups supporting the former Pahlavi monarchy were targeted and arrested by authorities across multiple cities. It was reported that some members in a monarchist organization had gone as far as infiltrating the government. During the protest the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had openly admitted the Pahlavi dynasty was popular among much of Iran's population.  Detainees  November 2019 demonstrations Isfahan On 10 December 2019 the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), which is a human rights organization based in New York City, put Iran among the countries with the highest number of imprisoned journalists. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network has stated that many detained protesters, some of them underage, are held under gruelling conditions. In addition, sources have characterized conditions in the Greater Tehran Central Penitentiary as \\"unbearable\\". In addition to the first phase of arrests during the demonstrations, the security forces examined photographs of licence plates taken during the protests \\"to identify leaders and speak to informants to identify more\\" protesters to arrest. Many observers are worried that some of those arrested have undergone severe torture and may face execution. On September 2, 2020, Amnesty International accused the Iranian government of widespread abuse of human rights during the 2019 protests that were sparked following soaring fuel prices. According to latest rights group report, Iran resorted to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment of those involved in the November unrest that rocked the Islamic Republic. = Arrest of journalists and lawyers = The European Parliament condemned the government of Iran for harassment of lawyers and journalists, and for denying legal assistance to the large number of protesters already in jail. = International organizations warn about torture = In a new statement Amnesty International has spoken about constant torture exerted on thousands arrested during November Uprising. The statement says, \\"they have been beaten, punched, kicked and flogged by security forces\\". Detainees include children of 15 and younger. On 28 December 2019, international human rights watchdog has warned prisoners in Iran's jails \\"are at risk of being tortured\\". =Assault on women= Amnesty International's investigator on Iran, Raha Bahreini, says he has received reports that a woman protester, detained during anti- government demonstrations following the downing of Ukrainian passenger plane, has been taken to a police station and sexually assaulted by security forces.  Deaths and casualties  = Death count estimates = thumbDeaths numbers by provinces The BBC has reported that there is a huge variance in reports of the number of people killed in the protests. On 23 December, Reuters reported that a death toll provided by three unnamed Iranian interior ministry officials was \\"about 1,500\\" including \\"at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women\\". These numbers were described as \\"fake news\\" by a government spokesman and based on figures made by the MEK a week prior. Amnesty International reported that \\"according to credible reports ... at least 304 people were killed and thousands injured between 15 and 18 November\\". The BBC has reported that unofficial reports from various sources say that from 15 to 19 November, about 200 people were killed and 3,000 injured. UN Human Rights said \\"dozens of people may have been killed\\" while Amnesty International places the number at \\"at least 106\\". Iranian authorities say \\"only a few people have been killed\\". One anonymous dissident politician told US journalist Dexter Filkins that he thinks the higher death estimates may be more accurate as in one location \\"two hundred people\\" were buried in \\"a single night\\". The Iranian government has announced that 230 persons were killed, including at least six police officers and soldiers. A man in Sirjan was killed and several others were injured after security forces opened fire on protesters on 15 November. The following day, ten protesters were killed during demonstrations. On 19 November, Amnesty International claimed that around 16 people were killed in Kermanshah, 14 each in Bandar-e Mahshahr and in Javanroud, 9 in Mariwan, 8 in Behbahan, 6 each in Ramhormoz, Sadra and in Shiraz, 4 each in Bukan, Karaj and in Robatkarim, 3 in Khorramshahr, 2 each in Abadan, Ahvaz and in Bumahen, and 1 each in Tehran, Isfahan, Eslamshahr, Sanandaj, Shahriar and in Sirjan. According to witness evidence reported in mid-late December, the Bandar-eMahshar death toll was much higher than initially estimated. The Iranian government brought in tanks to the streets of the city and security forces and the IRGC used heavy machine guns against unarmed people, leading to the death of 40‚Äì100 people. As of 26 November, Amnesty International reported that over 100 people had been killed during the protests, including accounts of wounded or dead protesters removed by government authorities to hide the magnitude of the crackdown on protesters. According to the BBC Persian, the number of deaths has exceeded 200. According to a report by The Guardian from Shiraz on 1 December, \\"those on the ground\\" in the city say the death toll is much higher than the 15 confirmed deaths counted by Amnesty International. Amnesty International reported that the Iranian government threatened families of the killed protestors against talking to the press. The families were forced to not arrange any funerals and to instead to carry out secret burials. Speaking at a news conference at the State Department on 5 December, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook stated that Iranian government forces killed more than 1,000 protesters. There were reports by US-backed Radio Farda that by 5 December 18 children had been killed by the Iranian government. As Reuters has reported, on the second day of Iran protest, in the presence of president Hassan Rouhani, some of his ministers and commanders of the security forces, asserting the government was in total danger, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei called to crush the demonstrators, stating \\"You have my order [...] Do whatever it takes to end it\\". At least 1500 people, including 400 women and 17 teenagers, were killed in the uprising. Many were shot directly in the head. = Death of injured protesters = Human Rights organizations, including Amnesty International, report that many Iranian protesters wounded in November demonstrations, still cannot use hospital attention as they may get arrested. Two injured protesters, Mohammad Maleki, 23 and Amir Ojani, 43 years old, died in last days of January, of acute infection and respiratory diseases. = Killing of children = On 3 March 2020, Amnesty International announced that security forces in Iran killed at least 23 children during November uprising in this country. The victims were 22 boys of age 12 to 17 and a girl who was under 12 years old.NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS AT LEAST 23 CHILDREN KILLED IN IRAN BY SECURITY FORCES DURING NOVEMBER PROTESTSSHARE = Government responsibility = Reuters reports that Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and President Hassan Rouhani ordered deadly weapons be used against the protesters. The order was \\"confirmed by three sources close to the supreme leader‚Äôs inner circle and a fourth official, set in motion the bloodiest crackdown on protesters since the Islamic Revolution in 1979\\". Khamenei has allegedly stated \\"the decision to use force was not his\\", but critics have noted that it is the \\"Supreme National Security Council\\" that makes decisions on how to deal with such demonstrations and deal with the political crisis in Iran. The council is presided by the president. Iran's constitution prescribes that all decisions taken by the council should be approved by Khamenei. who is also Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces. The government agents in Iran were accused of stealing the bodies of the dead protesters from morgues, and arresting the injured from hospitals, to give the uprising a lower profile. Aftermath Iranian news agency claimed that starting from 19 November 2019, thousands of people in cities across Iran participated in separate pro-government rallies in condemnation of the riots and showed support for the Iran supreme leadership. On 20 November 2019, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani declared victory against the \\"enemy\\". Iran started gradually restoring internet connection the following day. Many supporters (including IRGC leader Hossein Salami) also called for the death penalty on anti-government protesters. Amnesty International stated on 16 December that one month after the uprising, Iranian security forces are still arresting people and especially youth. Prisons, such as Fashafouyeh prison near the capital Tehran, are overcrowded with detainees, among them juveniles of 15 and younger. Prisoners are faced with daily torture and harassment. = Impacts = The savings from the fuel price rises are planned to be distributed to 18 million poor families, representing 75% of Iran's population. However, with inflation already at 40% and a plummeting currency, according to The Economist, \\"the inflationary effects of the price rise risk wiping out most of the benefit.\\" This inflationary threat has been acknowledged by Khamenei. = Debate in the Iranian parliament = Several criticisms of the Iranian authorities were made in December 2019 by members of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Iranian parliament. On 9 December 2019, Parvaneh Salahshouri, a female member of the parliament spoke against the country's top officials accusing them of not understanding the griefs of the low-income people and ignoring the deep-seated glitches of the country. On 10 December 2019, Ali Motahari, a member of Iran's parliament spoke out against the policies of the Supreme Leader and that entities under Khamenei's control have created a stalemate in the parliament. In return another hardliner has asked the Guardian Council to disqualify Motahari as a candidate for the upcoming elections for his \\"accuses the Supreme Leader in the gasoline issue\\". Fears that mass uprising could ignite again created conflicts within the Iranian ruling system. In early December 2019, Mahmood Alavi, the Intelligence Minister, has sent a letter to the speaker of the parliament asking him to stop Mahmood Sadeghi, a member of Parliament, acting \\"against national interests\\". Since the protests began in November, Sadeghi continued his attacks against some government entities, including the intelligence system. Sadeghi has also spoken against the forced confessions run by the Ministry of Intelligence and shown on state television.  Reactions  = National = * Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei **blamed the protests on \\"all of the centres of villainy around the world that oppose us.\\" ** \\"Both friends and foes should know that we have repelled the enemy in the war in military, political and security issues. The recent actions were security issues, not from the people. We have repelled the enemy in various areas, and by God's grace, we will also definitely repel the enemy in the economic war\\", (from a meeting with producers, economic activists and entrepreneurs on 19 November). **he also stated that setting fire to banks is not the action of ordinary people but of thugs, adding, \\"of course, officials should also pay attention and decrease the problems associated as much as they can,\\" (from the beginning of Dars-e Kharej (courses at the highest level of religious curriculum taught to students at seminaries) ) on 17 November). *Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's deposed Shah, tweeted that the Islamic Republic had brought only poverty and suffering to the Iranian people. He also said that the only thing offered for free by the Islamic Republic was oil to its allies in the region, a reference to Syria's president Bashar Assad. *Parvaneh Salahshouri, a member of parliament, stated that the decision to increase the price of fuel was not made by the Majles and had been made by the heads of the three branches. Salahshouri stated, \\"It has been a while now that parliament is not involved in the decision-making process.\\" She continued and, referring to the parliament, said, \\"The last semblance of a democracy we had is no more. Shut down the next parliament, it is an act of economic resistance\\". *Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Alavi Gorgani asked the government to \\"change their decision to increase fuel prices before it is too late\\". * Abolfazl Bahrampour, prominent Iranian Quran scholar, stated that the arrested protesters are Muharib and do not deserve normal execution, but must be tortured to death by mutilation of their right hands and left feet. He made these comments in the Iranian state-sponsored IRIB TV1 citing the 33rd Ayah of Al-Ma'ida Surah: \\"... The only punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is that they should be murdered, or crucified, or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides ...\\". *Dozens of artists living inside Iran published a statement in support of protesters, saying they will not forget the young faces of the dead, who were killed and then ignored by associating them with \\"foreigners\\". The statement condemned the violation of the people's \\"most basic human rights\\" and their \\"most apparent needs\\", and warned that people's voices \\"will remain in history\\". Prominent filmmakers including two-time Oscar winner Asghar Farhadi and Berlinale-winner Jafar Panahi, as well as well-known musicians Hossein Alizadeh and Kayhan Kalhor, are among the signatories of the statement. The statement also ridicules speeches by Iranian officials who have blamed protesters as being agents of foreign states, saying \\"the regime is trying to justify killing them\\". *Golshifteh Farahani, an Iranian actress who has been living in exile in France for the past decade, also carried out an extensive interview about the violent response to protests and the high number of people killed, wounded, or arrested. Speaking to Brut America, Farahani explained that many protesters started demonstrating because of a hike in gas prices, but \\"never came back home\\". In the video, the actress stated that the killed protesters were \\"son of some people\\", \\"fathers of some people\\", \\"daughters of some people\\", and \\"they are dead now\\". *Hichkas, Iranian rapper released a song about the recent protests and the inequality that plagues the Iranian society. In the song, titled \\"Clenched His Fists\\", the exiled rapper states the various grievances that led to the demonstrations and describes the brutality of the security forces. The song is in the spoken word format and includes audio snippets recorded by protesters on the street, where voices can be heard saying \\"they are shooting people\\". *In a comment to an American reporter (Dexter Filkins) an (anonymous Iranian) shop owner in the suburbs of Tehran who had witnessed the protests stated ‚ÄúThe 2009 protests showed that the regime had lost the middle class. The protests in November show that they‚Äôve lost the working class, too.‚Äù  University students  On 7 December 2019, commemorating the student's day, university students in various parts of Iran organized rallies shouting slogans against Hassan Rouhani and chief Justice Ebrahim Raeesi. Students also condemned the government for shooting and killing people during recent demonstrations.  Bus drivers  On 2 December 2019, the Tehran bus drivers' trade union called for the trial of those who ordered the shooting of the protesters. The union described the government's actions as a \\"massacre and bloody suppression\\". The statement by the Syndicate of Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company, also expressed concern about the situation of the thousands of detained protesters.  Lawyers  On 10 December 2019, 160 Iranian lawyers called for an investigation into the November killings. The lawyers also called for information regarding the several thousand detained protestors.  Mournings  Iranian regime threatens the families of those killed in recent protests not to talk to reporters or others. Nevertheless, families of young people killed by the regime's security forces are not giving in. Mother of Pooya Bakhtiari, killed by government agents, says her son was a \\"national hero\\". She continued that her son pursued \\"freedom, justice and truth\\", something that Iran's authorities will not grant to the people. = International =  States  * United States: **U.S. President of the United States Donald Trump announced his support for the protests stating \\"Iran has become so unstable that the government has shut down their entire Internet System so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country....\\" **U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo supported the demonstrations and stated that \\"The United States is with [the Iranian people]\\". **The Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized the Iranian government for not letting its civilians protest for a \\"better future\\" and to stop \\"showing violence against demonstrators.\\" ** On 3 December, US President Donald Trump, while attending NATO summit in London, said, \\"Iran is killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak\\". ** The United States said that the Iranian government had committed \\"gross human rights violations\\" during the protests. * European Union: **Josep Borrell, European Union's new High Representative for Foreign Affairs has condemned the use of deadly force by the Iranian regime against peaceful demonstrators. **Almost all political groups and tendencies in the European Parliament voted in favour of a resolution which condemned the Iranian government for its extensive use of force against peaceful protesters in November uprising. European lawmakers called for an independent investigation into atrocities including direct shooting at demonstrators. The resolution calls on the Iranian government \\"to announce the total number of detainees\\". The European parliament condemned the government of Iran for harassment of lawyers and journalists, and for denying legal assistance to the large number of protesters already in jail. * Germany: Chancellery urged Iran to respect the \\"legitimate\\" protests against a petrol price hike and open talks with the demonstrators: \\"It is legitimate and deserving of our respect when people courageously air their economic and political grievances, as is currently happening in Iran,\\" said Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer. * France: The French government said on Wednesday it was deeply concerned about reports of many deaths during protests in Iran and called on Tehran to respect its international human rights duties. France \\"expresses its deep concern over reports of the deaths of many demonstrators in recent days,\\" Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll told reporters in a daily online briefing. \\"France calls on Iran to respect its international human rights obligations.\\" * Sweden: Foreign Minister Ann Linde wrote on Twitter: \\"Terrible casualties in Iran. Nothing can justify this violence. Today's ambassador to Sweden from Our view is informed.\\"  Supernationals  * United Nations: The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet expressed her \\"deep concern\\" about the treatment of the large number of people arrested in the demonstrations. She also expressed concern about torture or execution of detainees. * Amnesty International started a petition in which human rights organisations asked United Nations (UN) member states to condemn the Iranian government for the crackdown on the unarmed protesters in the November uprising. The signatories include International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), Human Rights Watch (HRW), Justice for Iran and Amnesty International. \\"There must be independent and impartial investigations into these killings, and those suspected of ordering and carrying them out must be prosecuted in fair trials,\\" said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, in response to the killing of at least 23 children by security forces. = Sanctions after November uprising = The United States implemented sanctions on Mohammad- Javad Azari Jahromi, Iran's communications minister, following the deactivation of internet servers inside Iran. On 19 December 2019, the United States Government enforced sanctions on two Iranian judges, Abolghassem Salavati and Mohammad Moghisseh, for suppressing \\"freedoms of speech and assembly\\". Thousands of people are now in Iran's jails just for participating in November uprising. They may face torture or even execution. The two judges have long records of issuing long term prison sentences or death penalties for Iranians longing for democracy and opposed to the rule of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei.

Life  Born in Cologne, Demmer was baptised Carl Ignaz Anton on 11 February 1766 in the Cologne parish of .Cologne, St. Lupus, baptisms 1732‚Äì1775 and weddings 1733‚Äì1782, He began his artistic career as a choir singer at various churches in Cologne.Niem√∂ller (1960), . Around 1786, he became an opera singer, who is first documented at the society of Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Gro√ümann and its co-director Christian Wilhelm Klos in Cologne. The music director of the company was Friedrich August Burgm√ºller. Together with Burgm√ºller, Demmer then moved to the Theater Bonn, which was opened on 3 January 1789.Kopitz (1998), At Pentecost 1790, he moved to the troupe of J. A. Dietrich, which played mainly in the Netherlands. He met Karl Friedrich Kr√ºger and his sister Caroline, whom he soon married.Satori-Neumann (1922), The troupe also played at the just opened .Franz Carl Weidmann: Carl Kr√ºger. In Archiv f√ºr Geschichte, Statistik, Literatur und Kunst, No 14/15, 2/4 February 1824, , here On 4 February 1791 Demmer and his wife came to the Weimar court theatre,Christian August Vulpius: Eine Korrespondenz zur Kulturgeschichte der Goethezeit, edited by Andreas Meier. Berlin 2003, volume 2, where both were supported by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At Pentecost 1794, the couple appeared in Frankfurt. On 5 May Goethe's mother wrote to her son in Weimar: On 20 December 1799, Demmer gave a concert in Frankfurt to which he invited all his patrons.Maria Belli-Gontard: Leben in Frankfurt am Main. Ausz√ºge der Frag- und Anzeigungs-Nachrichten (des Intelligenz-Blattes). Frankfurt 1830, At the beginning of 1804, he signed a contract with the Vienna court opera, which was regretted in Frankfurt.Ueber den Zustand der Musik in Frankfurt am Mayn. In: Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, Jg. 5, No 24, 14 March 1804, , here A review noted his \\"strong steady voice with a high range\\". On 27 February 1804, Demmer gave his farewell performance in Frankfurt in the title role of Mozart's La clemenza di Tito. A few days later he travelled via Regensburg to Vienna where he arrived with his family on 7 March.Dieter Haberl: Das Regensburgische Diarium (Intelligenzblatt) als musikhistorische Quelle. Regensburg 2012, Demmer made his debut there on 20 June 1804 at the court opera as Edwinsky in the Vienna premiere of Fran√ßois- Adrien Boieldieu's Die Verwiesenen auf Kamtschatka.Vienna, Theatermuseum, Zettelsammlung; cf. also Voll (1807), The Vienna correspondent of the Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung gave an essentially positive review of Demmer's performance: The Vienna correspondent of the Berlinische musikalische Zeitung edited by Johann Friedrich Reichardt wrote somewhat more sceptically: The notice for the premiere of Beethoven's opera Leonore, oder Der Triumph der ehelichen Liebe (later revised as Fidelio), which took place on 20 November 1805 at the Theater an der Wien, then mentioned \\"Herr Demmer\\" in the role of Florestan. His partner was Anna Milder as Leonore, or Fidelio. The performance was a great failure for Beethoven, as even the protagonists were not given a good testimony: \\"Milder, despite her beautiful voice, had far too little affect and life for the role of Fidelio, and Demmer almost always intoned flat.\\" The opera was performed only three times.Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung, Jg. 8, No 15, 8 January 1806, Beethoven was also dissatisfied with Demmer's interpretation and replaced him with Joseph August R√∂ckel at the premiere of the second version on 26 March 1806.H. P. Clive: Demmer in: Beethoven and His World: A Biographical Dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 87‚Äì88, Among Demmer's great successes was the role of Ober- Seneschall in the Boildieu's singspiel Jean de Paris, which was first performed at the Theater an der Wien on 29 August 1812. The popular Cathinka Buchwieser appeared as the Princess of Navarre, and Demmer's daughter Josefine portrayed Lorezza.Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung, Jg. 14, No 39, 23 September 1812, Curiously, his brother Christian Demmer played the same role at the same time in a production of the court theatre.

Early life Cook was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on 1 October 1932, and received an appointment to the US Naval Academy, in Annapolis, in 1952, following a year at the University of Maryland in College Park. Although his father was employed at the academy, Cook was not immediately accepted into it upon his application. As his brother, John Cook, recalled in an interview conducted on 25 November 1989, \\"[Wilmer] was a third alternate for acceptance and he knocked on all kinds of doors to get in‚Ä¶. He really wanted to be career Navy.\\" Following his commissioning as an ensign on 1 June 1956, Cook reported for flight training at Naval Air Basic Training Command, Pensacola, and Naval Air Advanced Training, Memphis. He was designated as a naval aviator on 18 October 1957. Naval service Upon completion of that period of instruction, Cook returned to the Naval Air Basic Training Command, remaining there until January 1958. He subsequently attended Weapons Systems School at the Naval Air Technical Training Center in Jacksonville, Florida, before joining Attack Squadron (VA) 125, in June 1958, as a Douglas A-4D Skyhawk pilot. He later served as a fleet pilot and weapons officer with VA-216 (February-July 1959) before transferring to VA-192. He also qualified as officer of the deck while in the attack aircraft carrier . Eventually, he transferred to VA-112 to serve as assistant operations officer and material officer. Cook next served as an aviation science instructor and foreign student liaison officer at the U.S. Naval School, Pre-Flight, Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola (1962-65). He subsequently joined VA-125 as a fleet pilot. Owing to his considerable skill and experience with the Skyhawk, he trained fleet replacement pilots and enlisted men in the operation of the A-4. On 1 August, he received a promotion to lieutenant commander. Shortly thereafter, in November 1965, Cook transferred to VA-155, in Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 15. As a member of VA-155, Cook served Vietnam tours, flying over 300 missions in an A-4E. Starting in November 1965, he and his squadron were embarked in . Arriving off the coast of Vietnam on 15 June 1966, Constellation and CVW-15 were assigned to the Seventh Fleet and tasked with conducting operations against the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) and other military targets in North Vietnam. On 6 August 1966, Cook led a section of aircraft on a search and destroy mission against enemy torpedo (PT) boats south of Hon Gay Naval Base in North Vietnam. Discovering a heavily-camouflaged Swatow-class PT boat, Cook delivered two bombs, one of which struck the aft section of the craft and sank it. He and his section subsequently encountered another PT boat that they significantly damaged but did not destroy. For these actions, Cook would posthumously receive his first of seven air medals (Bronze Star in Lieu of the First Award). Cook earned his first Distinguished Flying Cross just six days later when he led a flight of four A-4Es on a surface-to-air missile (SAM)-suppression mission during an attack on the Thuong Thon, petroleum, oil, and lubricant storage area in the H√† Qu·∫£ng District. Escorting an attacking force of fourteen strike aircraft, Cook courageously exposed himself to enemy missile fire in order to deliver a point-blank attack against one of the firing sites, disabling its guidance system. He continued to harass other missile sites until the strike force had made a successful egress. Later that month on 31 August 1966, Cook led a night-time mission to investigate a high- speed surface contact a few miles east of the port of Haiphong. With only flare illumination to guide them, Cook and his section came under heavy fire from an enemy patrol craft. Unable to leave the illumination cone due to the overcast, he and his section made their bomb and rocket runs at minimum altitude and within range of the enemy‚Äôs guns. Their attacks sufficiently damaged the enemy vessel to set it aflame, forcing its crew to beach it. The naval aviator and his squadron subsequently destroyed the patrol craft, earning him a posthumous Navy Commendation Medal for \\"outstanding airmanship and aggressive determination in the face of adverse weather conditions, and while under enemy fire.\\" On 21 September 1966, Cook successfully led another SAM-suppression mission in support of an air strike on the railroad, storage, and transshipment complex of Thanh H√≥a. Once again, he exposed himself to heavy ground fire in order to protect the strike group, harassing the enemy and evading their attacks for over thirty minutes until the strike force had completed its mission and left the target area. Cook would posthumously be awarded his second Air Medal (Gold Star in Lieu of the Second Award) for his actions and \\"sound leadership.\\" Cook's leadership skills earned him two more Navy Commendation Medals over the course of two days in October 1966. On 21 October 1966, he led a SAM-suppression mission against the Quang Suoi petroleum storage area and transshipment depot, after which his flight reconnoitered the area south of the target site. Observing multiple ocean-type barges unloading at the mouth of the Thanh Hoa River, Cook unleashed an AGM-12 Bullpup air-to-ground missile attack against the barges. Assessing the damage, Cook recognized that the barges were carrying ammunition, and attacked once more. He then called in three additional strikes, completely destroying the barges. All of this was accomplished while in heavy antiaircraft fire. Less than a day later, Cook led another mission consisting of two strike craft and two SAM-suppression bombers against the Mai X√° railroad and highway bridge. After successfully destroying the target, Cook rendered assistance to a fighter plane which had been downed during the assault. Directing the rescue helicopter to the scene, Cook led his flight in strafing attacks against multiple North Vietnamese fishing junks attempting to capture the downed pilot, enabling him to be retrieved. Cook undertook another SAM-suppression mission on 6 November 1966. Leading a flight of two A-4Es, Cook and his wingman were charged with protecting two photo-reconnaissance planes as they flew over the H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng Bridge. Drawing away the radio-controlled antiaircraft fire and missiles from the reconnaissance flights. Cook and his wingman pressed the attack on the enemy launching sites, destroying two of them in the process. All of this was achieved under heavy fire, with one missile even coming within of Cook's aircraft. Cook's first Vietnam tour ended with Constellations return to San Diego, on 3 December 1966. Although he could have requested shore duty to train others to fly the A-4E, Cook volunteered for a second Vietnam tour in 1967. Prior to his departure, he flew back to Annapolis, in May 1967, to see his parents. As his father later recalled in a letter on 18 October 1968, to Rear Admiral Ernest M. Eller, the Director of Naval History, when asked why he wanted to go back, Lt. Cmdr. Cook replied, \\"I‚Äôll always go where my country sends me and will always do whatever it asks. Perhaps what I am doing may keep my two sons from going to war.\\" On 20 June 1967, CVW-15 embarked in . Much as he had done during his earlier service in Constellation, Cook distinguished himself during numerous SAM-suppression missions and attacks on PT boats. On 17 September 1967, he participated in an air strike on a railroad/highway bridge in Haiphong, drawing fire from two separate missile sites for nearly 30 minutes while the attacking force complete its mission. He participated in another strike in the same area just a day later, evading two surface-to-air missiles as he executed a perfect dive-bombing run on the bridge approaches. For his actions on both days, he would posthumously receive his fourth and final Navy Commendation Medal (Gold Star in Lieu of the Fourth Medal) and fifth Air Medal (Gold Star in Lieu of the Fifth Award). Cook achieved another significant milestone on 21 October 1967. While conducting an early morning coastal reconnaissance patrol amidst threatening overcast and reduced visibility, he and his squadron detected six PT boats. Upon sighting the aircraft, the boats raced out from under cover and opened fire, forcing Cook and his wingmen to undertake evasive maneuvers at low altitude. Determined to gain a favorable firing position on the enemy, Cook entered the overcast and made a shallow diving turn, relying solely on his instruments and own sense of timing. With the enemy now back in his sights, he released a bomb right into the center of their formation, sinking four of them and significantly damaging the other two. Having previously sunk one PT boat, Cook earned himself the distinction of being Coral Seas first \\"PT-boat ace\\". He would also be awarded his third Distinguished Flying Cross posthumously. Cook flew more missions following that, earning himself two more air medals in the process. Following the death of the squadron‚Äôs commanding officer, Commander William H. Searfus, Cook became acting CO of VA-155. As his roommate later recounted, when asked if the squadron could handle its duties without its senior officers, Cook replied, \\"If you can turn this boat [sic] into the wind, you will see Attack Squadron 155 ready to launch aircraft and hit our assigned targets.\\" =Death= On 22 December 1967, Cook and two other members of VA-155 were ordered to destroy a pontoon bridge on a supply route between Vinh and H√† Tƒ©nh. As they approached the target, they encountered heavy cloud cover, forcing Cook to drop below to locate the target. The precise details of what occurred at this point are unknown, but when he came back up, his two wingmen reported that his plane was on fire. While no one had seen firsthand what had occurred below the overcast, it is quite likely that the pilot had been struck by either small arms fire or fragments from his own bomb. He tried to reach the coast, but at some point along the way, he ejected from the aircraft. A rescue helicopter was sent to retrieve him, but as it drew within of his prone form, it appeared that Cook had suffered a broken neck and significant trauma to the back of his head, either as a result of the ejection or enemy gunfire. Believing him to be dead and drawing intense fire from nearby North Vietnamese soldiers, the pilots ultimately withdrew before they could land and retrieve his body. \\"Had there been any hope of life, he would have been picked up,\\" Commander James B. Linder, of CVW-15, wrote mournfully to Cook's widow, Joan. He went to on to emphasize that, \\"I wish to God we could bring him back but we can't.\\" Although the rescue team was certain that Cook was deceased, among Cook's surviving family members, questions still lingered about whether he might have survived and been taken prisoner. They would wait nearly twenty years to receive a definitive answer. In the interim, the Navy memorialized Cook by naming escort ship in his honor. At the ship's launching ceremony on 23 January 1971, with Cook's family in attendance, Vice Admiral Thomas F. Connolly, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Air), spoke eloquently of Cook's accomplishments and read aloud remembrances from some of his shipmates. One of them described their fallen comrade thusly: > The human side of ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù [Cook] is somewhat at odds with our movie version > stereotype image of a heroic pilot should be. In appearance, he certainly > cut no dashing figure; he was a round, balding man with a black mustache > perched on top of his ever-present smile. He didn‚Äôt talk like John Wayne - > rather his sentences were long, the logic sometimes involved, and he wasn‚Äôt > afraid to use words of greater than one syllable. He wasn't grim and > determined - he always seemed to inject humor and appeared to be taking > things lightly. > However, Bill did fulfill some aspects of the stereotyped hero. He greatly > enjoyed life. He liked people, conversation and argument - and he was > dedicated to his country, his home, and the Navy. I thought the world of > \\"Cookie\\" - he was one hell of a man. Repatriation On 15 December 1988, Vietnam returned the remains of four men as part of a repatriation agreement with the US government. For nine months, forensic specialists at the Army Identification Lab at Hickam Air Force Base, in Hawaii, worked to identify the fallen. Eventually, Cook's remains were positively identified alongside those of USAF Colonel Jerdy A. Wright Jr., Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Bush, and Major Charles J. Huneycutt, Jr. On 30 September 1989, all four were transported with full military honors from Hickam to Travis Air Force Base, in California. At the request of Cook's sons, a memorial for their father was held on board frigate Cook on 24 November 1989. As Commander Richard W. Kalb, the ship's CO, noted solemnly, \\"It's a rare occasion for a ship and her crew to be able to honor the man for whom the ship is named and to commend the remains to the deep.\\" For Cook's sons, the occasion proved even more emotional, with his youngest son, John, noting, \\"This will be the first time I've been in my father's presence for 22 years.\\" He went on to state, \\"I don‚Äôt know how to react because it's like a new thing, like becoming aware that my father is really here.\\" Cook's ashes were scattered from Cook's deck into the Pacific on 27 November 1989, bringing to an end a nearly twenty-year ordeal for his family and finally laying the accomplished naval aviator to rest. Awards For his valiant efforts, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross (Four Stars), the Air Medal 15th Strike/Flight Award, Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ‚ÄúV‚Äù (Three Stars), the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and Republic of Vietnam Ribbon Bar.

The play led Penn State to beat Ohio State for the first time in five years, with a final score of 24‚Äì21. It is regarded as the best play in Penn State football history, and ignited the program's current status as a national powerhouse. The Game Penn State was a 19.5-point home underdog in this matchup, as they were not ranked in the AP poll. Much of this was attributed to this game being a White Out in State College, and the Buckeyes scraping by Wisconsin in an overtime road win the week before. Penn State was on a winning streak since falling to then-No. 4 Michigan in early September, while Ohio State was undefeated. The game was initially very low scoring; neither team was able to get points on the board in the first quarter. By the beginning of the second quarter, however, Ohio State answered with two Tyler Durbin field goals and a Marcus Baugh touchdown, making the Buckeyes have a 12‚Äì0 lead. However, in the final seconds of the second quarter, a pass by Trace McSorley to Chris Godwin in the endzone made Penn State \\"completely change the dynamics of the game.\\" The third quarter saw Ohio State pick up another touchdown (by Curtis Samuel) and a high snap on a punt resulting in a safety. However, the Buckeyes remained scoreless throughout the fourth quarter. This was while Trace McSorley scored a touchdown with a successful conversion, as well as a 34-yard field goal by Tyler Davis. The Play With just over four minutes remaining in regulation time and the score 21‚Äì17 Ohio State, the Buckeyes were within field goal range but were held to a fourth down at the 31-yard line. Tyler Durbin looked to make Ohio State score for the first time in the quarter with a 45-yard field goal. Speculators were highly anticipating the kick to be good, making the final score 24‚Äì17 Ohio State, as Durbin was described to be \\"super reliable from inside of 40.\\" However, the kick was blocked by safety Marcus Allen and knocked to cornerback Grant Haley, who sped past Durbin and another Buckeye, running 71 yards for a Penn State touchdown, making the final score of the game 24‚Äì21 Penn State.

Two-Face has been voiced by Richard Moll in the DC animated universe, Troy Baker in the Batman: Arkham series, Billy Dee Williams in The Lego Batman Movie, and William Shatner in Batman vs. Two-Face. His live-action portrayals include Billy Dee Williams in Batman (as Harvey Dent only), Tommy Lee Jones in Batman Forever, Aaron Eckhart in The Dark Knight, and Nicholas D'Agosto in the television series Gotham. In 2009, Two-Face was ranked #12 on IGN's list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time. Television =Live-action= Nicholas D'Agosto as Harvey Dent on Gotham. * The 1960s Batman television series developed several tentative scripts for Two-Face, but (likely due to broadcast standards at the time) never produced any of them; at one point, Clint Eastwood was allegedly slated for the role. The most prominent of the scripts, submitted by New Wave science fiction author Harlan Ellison, was eventually adapted into the 2015 comic Batman '66: The Lost Episode. * A pre- disfigured version of Harvey Dent appears on the live-action TV series Gotham, portrayed by Nicholas D'Agosto. He first appears in the season one episode \\"Harvey Dent\\" in which he is portrayed as the Assistant District Attorney of Gotham City. In the episode \\"The Son of Gotham\\", Dent prosecutes corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan (James Frain) for kidnapping Mayor Aubrey James (Richard Kind), but his trial strategy is sandbagged when James, fearing Galavan's retribution, perjures himself and testifies that Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), not Galavan, kidnapped him. In the episode \\"Mr. Freeze\\", Dent, along with GCPD Captain Nathaniel Barnes (Michael Chiklis), questions Detective Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) about his role in Galavan's death. In the episode \\"Prisoners\\", when Gordon has been framed for murder and sentenced to Blackgate Penitentiary, his partner Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue) tries to persuade Dent to reopen Gordon's trial or at least transfer him to another facility, to no avail. * Two-Face makes a cameo appearance in Titans, portrayed by an unknown by stunt double. In the first season finale, titled \\"Dick Grayson\\", the eponymous character is placed in a dream world created by Trigon, where Batman has gone on a killing spree, taking out his greatest enemies one by one; Two-Face is among them since his dead body can be seen holding his coin inside his cell at Arkham Asylum. * Dent got mentioned in the Batwoman episode \\"Grinning From Ear to Ear\\", his niece is Duela Dent who slash her own face. =Animation= * The Harvey Dent version of Two-Face made many appearances in the DC Animated Universe, voiced by Richard Moll.Harvey Dent / Two-Face, as depicted in the DC Animated Universe. ** Initially, Batman: The Animated Series depicted Harvey Dent as not only Gotham City's preeminent District Attorney, but also a best friend to Bruce Wayne (whose alter-ego he remained blithely unaware of). At one point, he dated botanist Dr. Pamela Isley, though she attempted to kill him as supervillainess Poison Ivy over causing a near-extinction of a floral species when building Blackgate Penitentiary. Though leading a prestigious life and happy engagement to fellow attorney Grace Lamont, he nevertheless began to succumb to his dissociative identity disorder (supposedly stemming from lifelong repression of anger after a childhood bullying incident) during the stress of his reelection campaign. This was exacerbated by crime boss Rupert Thorne, who stole his therapy records to use as blackmail material; under Thorne's taunts, Dent gave in to his alternate personality Big Bad Harv, who savagely attacked Thorne's gang. A shootout ensued, and though Batman arrived in time to help Dent, his efforts inadvertently triggered an explosion that severely scarred the left half of Dent's face and body. Subsequently, Dent (and his alternate personality) abandoned any hope of a \\"normal\\" life, and began waging a vendetta against Thorne as the coin-flipping criminal Two-Face. Thorne later tricks Grace into luring Two-Face out and holds both at gunpoint. Two-Face overpowers Thorne and attempts to kill the mobster, but Batman stops Two-Face and sends him to Arkham Asylum. Two-Face is depicted as a crime boss and supervillain in his own right for subsequent episodes. In the episode \\"The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne\\", Two-Face has a fierce bidding war with the Joker and the Penguin regarding Batman's secret identity at Hugo Strange's auction. Two-Face is later shown alongside Poison Ivy, the Penguin, Killer Croc and the Joker in the episode \\"Almost Got 'Im\\", during a poker game where each villain brings up a respective encounter with the Dark Knight. In Two-Face's story, he tied Batman on top of a giant coin. When flipped, it would either crush Batman or break all of the Dark Knight's bones. But Batman secretly stole his trademark coin and use the jagged edge to cut through the ropes, capturing Two-Face and his gang. When Poison Ivy asked him what happened to it, he said that \\"they let him keep [the coin]\\". In the two-part episode \\"Shadow of the Bat\\", Two- Face manipulates Gil Mason into infiltrating Gotham's justice system as the new Deputy Police Commissioner. Mason's high level of practical abilities earned Commissioner Gordon's trust, and the two eventually arrest Thorne. Although Two-Face and Mason frame Gordon for working with Thorne, they are eventually exposed by Batman, Dick Grayson and Barbara Gordon. In the episode \\"Trial\\", Two-Face acts as the 'prosecutor' when Batman's rogues gallery hold the Dark Knight prisoner at Arkham Asylum in a kangaroo court. In the episode \\"Second Chance\\", Dent undergoes cosmetic surgery to destroy Two-Face's personality permanently. But before he can go through with the operation, he is kidnapped by thugs under Two-Face's orders in an attempt to remain in control of Dent's psyche. Eventually, Batman and Robin recapture Two-Face and is later grateful to Bruce as he's returned to Arkham. ** Two-Face returns in The New Batman Adventures. In the episode \\"Sins of the Father\\", Two-Face is indirectly responsible for Tim Drake's transformation into Robin. He had Shifty Drake on the run and led to his ex-henchman's death, motivating Robin to join forces with Batman and Batgirl in order to bring Two-Face to justice. The episode \\"Judgement Day\\" reveals that Harvey Dent's psyche fragments again in the form of the Judge (voiced by Malachi Throne), a court-themed vigilante who apprehends criminals by using extreme measures. Neither Two-Face nor Dent are aware of the Judge's existence within their shared mind, and the Judge is unaware that he is Two-Face, and attempts to murder Two-Face several times. Two-Face also tries to hunt down the Judge, deciding to kill a corrupt city councilman who supported the Judge to send a message. The Judge is defeated by Batman, and the final scene of the episode shows the Judge putting the Two- Face personality on trial. ** Although Two-Face does not appear in Batman Beyond, an android replica is seen in the episode \\"Terry's Friend Dates a Robot\\" and is also mentioned in the episode \\"Betrayal\\". When asked about his fate, show creator Paul Dini stated that his character was cured and returned to his career in politics, moving to Los Angeles and working as a lawyer for a major motion picture studio, doing very well at that job.ToyFare issue, 1999 ** Two-Face is seen in the Justice League animated series. In the episode \\"A Better World\\", an alternate reality version makes a cameo appearance as a lobotomized janitor in the Justice Lords' dimension. In the series finale \\"Starcrossed\\", Two-Face's coin is seen on display in the Batcave to which the Flash (Wally West) uses to flip on top of several Thanagarian soldiers. * The Harvey Dent iteration of Two-Face appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by James Remar (in \\"The Fate of Equinox!\\" and in \\"The Mask of Matches Malone!\\") and by Richard Moll (in \\"Chill of the Night!\\"). He first appears in \\"Legends of the Dark Mite!\\" as part of Bat-Mite's fantasy. In the teaser of \\"The Fate of Equinox!\\", Two-Face is taken down by Batman. He makes a cameo in \\"Mayhem of the Music Meister!\\" singing with the other villains at Arkham Asylum. In \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\", he is one of the villains Robin, Speedy and Aqualad face off against during a simulation in the Batcave. In \\"Chill of the Night!\\", Two-Face is one of the villains bidding for a supersonic weapon held by arms dealer Joe Chill. He joins the villains in attacking Chill when they learn that he was indirectly responsible for Batman's creation, before escaping the scene. He also appears in \\"The Mask of Matches Malone!\\", where Two-Face is pursued by Huntress, Black Canary and Catwoman. This incarnation, because of the Golden and Silver Age inspirations of the show, is depicted with green scars. * Paul Sloane appears in the Young Justice cartoon series, voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. He appears in the episode \\"Image\\", as one of the actors on the fictional sitcom Hello Megan, of which Miss Martian is a fan of. In the episode \\"Nightmare Monkeys,\\" Paul Sloane once worked with Garfield Logan on Space Trek 3016 as Gretchen Goode praised their performance. * Harvey Dent appears in Beware the Batman, voiced by Christopher McDonald. He serves as Gotham's District Attorney, and takes a stand against vigilantes like Batman and Katana to help his campaign as Mayor unlike in the comics where he is an ally to Batman, his friendship with Bruce Wayne, seen in previous media, is however intact. Desperate, he secretly begins working with the supervillain Anarky to bring Batman down, and they later hire the mercenary Deathstroke to kill the Dark Knight. Deathstroke uses Dent as bait to lure Batman, but his attempt on the Caped Crusader's life is unsuccessful. Later, Dent intervenes another battle between Batman and Deathstroke (dressed as Batman) in the Gotham Armory. The altercation causes a massive explosion, in which Dent's face is scarred. Now wrapped in bandages, Dent attacks Batman and even Anarky, who mockingly dubs him \\"Two-Face\\". His sanity unraveled and his career ruined, Dent declares that he has \\"plans\\" for Gotham as he unwraps his bandages denying the viewers the chance to see what the scarred side looks like as he walks off into the night. * The Harvey Dent iteration of Two-Face makes a cameo appearance in the Teen Titans Go! animated series. * The Harvey Dent iteration of Two-Face appears in Justice League Action, voiced by Robert Picardo. This incarnation has developed a second personality, which causes Two-Face to have an argument with himself. In the episode \\"Double Cross\\", the Penguin had hired Deadshot to take out Two-Face. As part of Batman and Firestorm's plan to apprehend Deadshot, Batman has Plastic Man pose as Two- Face after apprehending him. During this plot, the real Two-Face escapes from Firestorm's custody. Both Two-Face and Deadshot are defeated by Batman, Firestorm, and Plastic Man. This incarnation, like his DC Animated Universe incarnation, is depicted with blue scars. * The Harvey Dent version of Two- Face appears in Harley Quinn, voiced by Andy Daly. Introduced in the episode, \\"A High Bar\\", this version of Two-Face is depicted as not having a split personality and being blind in one eye. He makes one speaking and two non- speaking appearances in season one, one of which establishes him as a member of the Legion of Doom. In the season two premiere, \\"New Gotham\\", Two-Face formed the Injustice League alongside Penguin, Bane, Riddler, and Mr. Freeze to take advantage of the chaos Joker caused when he destroyed Gotham and divided the ruins between them. In the episode \\"Batman's Back Man\\", following Harley defeating most of the League, Two-Face and Bane attempt to consolidate their remaining power, though the former refuses to see the latter as an equal partner. After Bane almost kills him in an outburst, Two-Face give him a pit to make him feel better. In the episode \\"All the Best Inmates Have Daddy Issues\\", Harvey Dent is seen in a flashback, in which he led an operation to find and disarm a bomb hidden by the Joker as part of a mayoral campaign. At the end of the episode, Two-Face \\"arrested\\" Harley and Poison Ivy before putting them on trial on a kangaroo court and sending them to a prison run by Bane in the following episode, \\"There's No Place to Go But Down\\". He is later defeated and incarcerated by Commissioner James Gordon. In the season two finale, \\"The Runaway Bridesmaid\\", Two-Face is imprisoned at Arkham, but manipulates Gordon into busting Kite Man and Ivy's wedding. He later tells an imprisoned Harley about this and briefly teams up with her to escape from Arkham. Film =Live-action= Batman * A pre-disfigured version of Harvey Dent appears in Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, portrayed by Billy Dee Williams. As the newly elected district attorney of Gotham, Dent vows to lock up mob boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). * Williams was set to reprise his role in Batman Returns with his villainous alter-ego surfacing to attempt to take control of Gotham, but was ultimately written out of the sequel, however, and replaced by Christopher Walken as the corrupt billionaire Max Shreck who had a similar agenda, while the role of the movie's main villain was given to the Penguin (Danny DeVito). * Tommy Lee Jones portrays Harvey Dent/Two-Face in the 1995 film Batman Forever, replacing Billy Dee Williams from Batman. His origin story is the same as in the comics, where the district attorney is disfigured when gangster Sal Maroni throws acid on the left side of his face during a trial. He is driven insane to the point of referring to himself in the plural --, and swears revenge against Batman (Val Kilmer) for failing to save him. He is portrayed as having two molls for each side of his personality - the angelic Sugar (Drew Barrymore) for his \\"good\\" side, and the tempestuous \\"Spice\\" (Debi Mazar) for his \\"bad\\" side. He and his men attack Haly's Circus and murder Dick Grayson's (Chris O'Donnell) family; he is thus indirectly responsible for the youth's transformation into Robin. Two-Face later teams up with the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and learns Batman's secret identity. Two-Face captures Robin and Batman's love interest Dr. Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman), and holds them hostage at the Riddler's lair. During the movie's climax, when Two-Face flips his coin, Batman throws a handful of coins into the air. Two-Face then panics and scrambles to find his coin but loses his footing, and subsequently fall. However, director Joel Schumacher reveals in the DVD commentary that Two-Face survives the fall. * In Batman & Robin, Two-Face's costume is seen in Arkham Asylum. The Dark Knight Trilogy * Harvey Dent was planned to appear in the early scripts of Batman Begins, but was finally cut and replaced by the original character Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes). According to writer David S. Goyer, the main reason for which Dent was written out from the film was because they realized they \\"couldn't do him justice\\". Aaron Eckhart as Harvey \\"Two-Face\\" Dent in The Dark Knight (2008). * Aaron Eckhart portrays Harvey \\"Two-Face\\" Dent in The Dark Knight. In the film, he is depicted as a tragic hero, lacking the gimmickry and multiple personalities commonly associated with the character. At the film's beginning, Dent is Gotham City's new District Attorney and forms a tenuous alliance with Batman (Christian Bale) and Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman) in order to take down Gotham's organized crime. Corrupt police officers working for mob boss Sal Maroni (Eric Roberts) and the Joker (Heath Ledger) kidnap Dent and his girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and hold them prisoner in two abandoned buildings set to explode. When the buildings explode, the left half of Dent's face catches fire, leaving him disfigured, while Rachel is killed. The Joker visits Dent while he's recovering at Gotham General Hospital, and persuades him to exact revenge against those he believes are responsible for Rachel's death. He embraces the nickname the Gotham police had given him during his Internal Affairs stint - \\"Two-Face\\" - and decides his victims' fates with his two-headed Peace dollar that was scarred on one side during the explosion that disfigured him. Two- Face shoots and kills one of the traitorous cops who betrayed him and Rachel to the mob, and soon kills Maroni as well.

He serves as the third boss and drives his armored truck around and Batman needs to shoot him until crosshairs appear, then he needs to grapple on to him and tow him into the police helicopter searchlight and a bomb drops on him. In the villain side of the story, the Riddler assigns him to steal a super laser from Wayne Tech. He parks his truck outside and they sneak in by riding on top of a delivery van and digging under the wall into the building. When they find the super laser, he flips his coin to decide who gets to try it out. it ends up deciding he gets to use it, and he destroys a giant mecha-suit with it.

First, the freeze cannon that Mr. Freeze helped the Riddler get to create an ice bridge skate across the moat (but Two-Face slips and slides the whole way), the super laser to destroy it after they're across (obviously so no one would follow them), and the mutated vine seeds that Poison Ivy helped the Riddler get to lift them up a steep cliff (Two-Face's grows faster and it ends up making him land flat on his face) (it is unknown what they use the key that Clayface helped the Riddler get for). They try to use the super laser again to bust down a steel door but the bolt ends up bouncing all over the place and then back at them destroying the super laser, and then they hijack a police helicopter and destroy it the door with missiles. Back in the hero story, they attempt to open a door when Batman and Robin find them and the Riddler tells Two-Face to deal with them.

He then battles the duo as a miniboss, but if he crosses the chemicals, they need to use Robin's attract suit to suck up pieces to build a boat and ride over them in order to attack him. He catches up with the Riddler and finds the gold. In the Riddler's boss fight, the Riddler uses mind-control on him and makes him fight alongside him, but they knock Two-Face into him and make gold bars fall on them.

It was there that Archimandrite Vasily, the head of the monastery, encouraged him to study theology. Sometime later he was elevated to deacon by the bishop Mihailo Jovanoviƒá of ≈†abac.The bishop then sent him to Imperial Russia to study at the Kiev Theological Academy. After graduation, he was appointed a clerk of the Belgrade Consistory in 1862. In August 1866, he was appointed a professor of theology. In 1867 he was named the head of the monastery of Draƒça, near Kragujevac.Again in 1868 he was returned back to his chair as professor of theology and elevated to the monastic rank of archimandrite.

In June 1880, he was returned to active service as Bishop of Negotin. When Metropolitan Mihailo Jovanoviƒá of Serbia was overthrown in 1881, the Serbian government-appointed Bishop Mojsije as an administrator of the Metropolitanate of Belgrade. It was a difficult period when the Serbian government sought to control and subjugate the church to its Austrophilic policies. The Serbian Bishops' Council was dissolved and its members tried in vain to persuade the Serbian government to divert from this harmful path of dealing with the church. The Serbian government knew that the Bishops' Council would not select a suitable candidate for them, so they imposed a special body for the election of the metropolitan, who then elected the metropolitan Teodosije Mraoviƒá in 1883. Mojsije did not respond to the calls of the new metropolitan, deeming him illegitimate, and all his acts as invalid. Although the new Metropolitan Teodosije included Mojsije in the structure of his hierarchy, Bishop Mojsije refused to cooperate with him. He was fined twice by the Serbian government for insubordination. Shortly afterward he was dismissed in April 1883.

Mure»ôan responded by criticizing the Moldovan government for not implementing reforms or fighting corruption. Chicu's words caused controversy in Romania. In fact, Moldovan-born Romanian deputy Constantin Codreanu requested the withdrawal of Chicu's Romanian citizenship. Other Romanian authorities also criticized his words. However, collaboration during the COVID-19 pandemic continued between the two countries. Chicu would later apologize during a meeting with the Romanian ambassador in Moldova Daniel Ioni»õƒÉ, reiterating his thanks to the country for its help to Moldova during the pandemic.

Abt. III: Die Orden mit Benediktinerregel. 2/1: Fr√ºhe Kl√∂ster, die Benediktiner und Benediktinerinnen in der Schweiz. Francke Verlag, Bern 1986, S. 1328 f. The papal confirmation of the election occurred upon request of Melchior Lussy on 13 July 1565. He was consecrated by Auxiliary Bishop Jakob Eliner of Konstanz, assisted by the abbots of Einsiedeln and Ottobeuren.  Works  During Otmar's abbacy, the Abbey of Saint Gall renewed their alliance with France. His tenure was mostly characterised by a more severe separation of the catholic abbey and the protestant city. In the Rorschach treaty of the 13 September 1566 and the ruling of Wil on 20 September 1566 it was determined that a 31ft high wall be built between abbey and city. Cunstruction was largely completed by October 1567. The southern gate, the so-called Karlstor, was completed in 1570 and enabled access to the abbey without ever entering city territory. Abbot Otmar appears repeatedly as a builder. In 1568, he had the abbey of St. Johann rebuilt after it had been destroyed by arson. Furthermore, he was also keen on the construction of infirmaries in Bruggen and Rorschach. A further focus of his abbacy was placed on the counter- reformation. Following the Konstanz synodus diocesana of 1567, Otmar established the Reformatio Sancti Galli. In his decrees he admonished his subjects to go to confession and communion. While his reforms in the F√ºrstenland were largely successful, his attempts at recatholicising the Toggenburg were less so. He had a number of his conventuals be educated in Paris by the Jesuits. Otmar enriched the abbey library with several hundred books he bought in Paris, as well as newly produced liturgical manuscripts.

The story jumps around a greasy spoon's several patrons and two waitresses, oblivious to a bomb under one of the tables, the timer set for five minutes. Plot In a Montr√©al restaurant, two waitresses (Carmen Ferland and Jocelyne Zucco) serve dishes, chatting between themselves about a love interest, and with the customers. A portly man () orders a second dish which he does not eat, enjoying the smell and his sense of victory for avoiding fat and cholesterol. A mother and her young daughter (Ghyslaine C√¥t√© and Catherine P√©pin) wait for a man to arrive. An elegant older woman (Huguette Oligny) catches the eye of another older diner (). Outside the caf√© a lovers' quarrel is going on between a young man and woman (David Boutin and ). A man in a jacket () sits at a reserved table, and sticks a dynamite time bomb underneath it. Told the table is reserved, he rises and makes a phone call using the restaurant's phone, just as two English-speaking mafiosi (Bruno Di Quenzio and Manuel Tadros) enter and sit at the same table. The bomber takes out a pack of cigarettes in which he has hidden an instrument for setting the timer remotely, and sets it for five minutes. A sequence of images follows of everyone else lit up with white light. The bomber goes outside and rights a trash bin which had been knocked over during the lovers' quarrel. He dumps the remote and departs. Inside, a mafioso receives a phone call, swears in frustration, and both men leave without ordering. The little girl notices something under the reserved table. The quarrellers enter and sit at the table. The older man makes his way towards the older lady but stops short and sits in the booth of the portly man. The couple continue their quarrel, the older lady looking at them sympathetically. The little girl, called Jos√©e- Marguerite, watches the bomb, whose timer now reads 3:15. Her mother chides her for staring at other people and she responds that there is something flashing under the table. Her mother looks, but sees only the young man's knee, and asks why the girl is making things up. Jos√©e-Marguerite shrugs. As the timer reaches 2:55, the portly man observes the older lady in the reflection of the older man's pocket watch. He notices a flashing red light as well, but is distracted as the older man says \\"That woman's dynamite!\\" He explains that he is taking his time, not wanting to scare her off, and compares her to Bambi. He needs to make a move quickly after all when she asks for the bill. She only ate a bit of everything in her role as a food critic. The first waitress declares the meal free, takes the plate, trips as the older man tries to go past her, and finds herself sitting in the booth with the portly man, the dish now in front of him. The timer reaches 2:35. The mother leaves the booth to check if her boyfriend is arriving. The portly man decides it is his fate to eat the cholesterol-heavy meal. Despite her mother telling her to sit quietly, Jos√©e-Marguerite leaves their booth to get a closer look at the bomb. She points at it and asks \\"What is that?\\" ‚Äî but just then her mother arrives and admonishes her. The young woman places her hands on the table with some force and the bomb is half dislodged underneath. She says she is going to the washroom and her boyfriend had better have changed his attitude by the time she gets back. The portly man orders coffee and cigarettes. The timer counts down to 0:59, and the older lady rises and whispers advice to the young man on her way out. She pauses and smiles at the older man and he gets up to follow her while the timer counts down to 0:42. He is delayed by a new patron coming through the door ‚Äî the mother's awaited boyfriend (). She asks Jos√©e-Marguerite what it was she had wanted to say earlier, but the frustrated girl says it is \\"too late\\" as the timer counts down to 0:28. The young couple are reconciled, which pleases the older lady looking through the window. The older man continues to struggle with the door. The timer counts down from 0:10 to 0:03 ‚Äî and stops. The older lady has found the remote in the bin outside. She flips a switch and the timer continues down to 0:01. She flips it again and holds it to her ear and shakes it, finally giving up and throwing it into the bin. She is followed by the older man as she leaves. Inside, the portly man enjoys the older lady's leftovers, Jos√©e- Marguerite meets her mother's boyfriend, the waitresses finally have time to catch up on each other's news, and the young couple kiss passionately. The bomb remains half-dislodged, the timer still showing 0:01.

Life  Kuku was born in Novorossiysk on 26 June 1976. In 1993, the family moved to Crimea. They obtained a plot of land for the erection of a house in the native village of Kemala Cook in Koreiz. In 2000, Kuku graduated from Kherson National Technical University with a degree in management. In 2001 he graduated from Kharkiv Financial and Economic Institute majoring in accounting. Before the annexation of Crimea, Kuku fought for the preservation of a Crimean Tatar cemetery and was involved in monitoring cases of discrimination against Muslims. Since 2014, he participated in helping Crimean political prisoners and in the search for missing people. Kuku was the organizer of a rally in memory of the deportation of Crimean Tatars in 2014. =Criminal prosecution and arrest= On April 20, 2015, after Kuku exposed the attempt of the FSB to recruit him as a secret informant, he was apprehended in camouflage by unmarked people, taken to his home, where he was searched and then interrogated by the secret service. It was alleged that investigative actions are conducted within the framework of a criminal case under Art. 282 of the Criminal Code (\\"Actions aimed at arousing hatred or enmity\\"). Kuku was beaten on the way for interrogation, later he was diagnosed with kidney issues in a medical facility. On February 11, 2016, a search took place at Kuku's house in Koreiz, and was detained by Russian authorities. He has been charged with alleged involvement in the activities of the Islamist organization Hizb ut-Tahrir although Kuku denies any involvement in this organization. In December 2017 Kuku and five his co-defendants, Muslim Aliyev, Vadim Siruk, Enver Bekirov, Refat Alimov and Arsen Dzhepparov were moved to Rostov-on-Don.

Front Line Defenders expressed its concern on the trial and believes that the charges brought against him are based on fabricated evidence. Human Rights Watch cited the arrest of Kuku as an example for persecution of Crimean Tatars. According to the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group the only evidence that the prosecution has provided is a \\"pseudo assessment of a recorded conversation ‚Äúin the kitchen‚Äù where the men were discussing the situation in Russia, Ukraine, the fate of Crimea, the place of Islam in both countries and various religious postulates.\\" In November 2018 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which called for the urgent release of Ukrainian citizens Oleg Sentsov, Volodymyr Balukh and Emir-Usein Kuku.

Following Chandrayaan-2 where a snag in communication led to the failure of the lander's soft landing attempt, after a successful orbital insertion, another lunar mission for demonstrating soft landing was proposed. Chandrayaan-3 will be a mission repeat of Chandrayaan-2 but will only include a lander and rover similar to that of Chandrayaan-2. It will not have an orbiter. Realisation within schedule will make ISRO the world's fourth space agency to conduct soft lunar landing after the administration of former USSR, NASA and CNSA. Background In the second phase of the Chandrayaan programme to demonstrate soft landing on the Moon, ISRO launched Chandrayaan-2 onboard a GSLV Mk III rocket consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover. The lander was scheduled to touchdown on the lunar surface in September 2019 to deploy the Pragyan rover. Earlier reports had emerged about a collaboration with Japan on a mission to the lunar south pole where India would be providing the lander while Japan would provide both launcher and rover.

Subsequent failure of the Vikram lander led to the pursuit of another mission to demonstrate the landing capabilities needed for the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission proposed in partnership with Japan for 2024.ISRO Will Embark on Chandrayaan 3 by November 2020 for Another Landing Attempt. The Wire. 14 November 2019.  Design  The lander for Chandrayaan-3 will have only four throttle-able engines unlike Vikram on Chandrayaan-2 which had five 800 N engines with fifth one being centrally mounted and with fixed thrust. Additionally the Chandrayaan-3 lander will also be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV). Funding In December 2019, it was reported that ISRO requested the initial funding of the project, amounting to , out of which will be for meeting expenditure towards machinery, equipment and other capital expenditure, while the remaining is sought under revenue expenditure head. Confirming the existence of the project, ISRO's chairman K. Sivan stated that the cost would be around .

Biographical Dictionary, volume IV M-P , Wydawnictwo Sejmowe, Warsaw, 2009, p. 307Maciej Sierkierski, Helena Paderewska: Memoirs, 1910-1920 (Hoover Institution Press 2015)  Early and family life  Born in Warsaw in 1856 to an aristocratic Polish father of Baltic German descent (Baron Wladislaw Friedrich Johann Kasimir von Rosen, b. 1829) and the former Zofia Taube, who had met during his military service in the Crimean War. Her mother Zofia was born into a noble family of Baltic heritage whose ancestors came from Denmark. Her mother died shortly after Helena's birth.Sierkierski, p. xviii At the time, Warsaw was part of Congress Poland, with the Russian Tsar also the Polish King since the 1815 treaty ending the Napoleonic Wars, which also contained a provision suppressing the name \\"Poland\\" (one of Napoleon's allies having been the Duchy of Warsaw). Polish identity and culture had been forced into dissident channels, particularly in Russian- (and after 1871 also Prussian-) administered areas. (The last Polish-Lithuanian King, Augustus III of Poland, had died in 1763 and the resulting Commonwealth government had launched Europe's first secular school system a decade later, as the big-power partitions which led to the Polish state's dismemberment began).Norman Davies' introduction in Sierkierski p. xii She had an elder brother, possibly the father of Robert Otto von Rosen (b. 1879). Her father remarried and Helena von Rosen was raised by her paternal grandmother, Katarzyna (Rucinska) von Rosen, and her aunt Emilia Leokadia (von Rosen) Jaszowska.Sierkierski p. xviii She became fluent in four languages (especially French) but received little formal education. At age 17, she married W≈Çadys≈Çaw G√≥rski (1846-1915), then a decade her senior and a violin soloist with the Warsaw Opera orchestra.Sierkierski p. xviii Their son, Wac≈Çaw Otton G√≥rski (1877-1936) would move to the United States, become a journalist, marry twice, and would be buried in Indianapolis.Sierkierski p. 186 They also had a daughter, Maria G√≥rska. However, marital issues which began the year after their son's birth caused their separation. Divorce not being recognized by the Catholic church, von Rosen lived for years with Ignacy Jan Paderewski, her future second husband and a widower since his first wife Antonina Korsak had died of complications following the birth of their severely disabled son Alfred (1880-1901). Helena and Ignacy had first met circa 1878, when Paderewski was a rising young pianist near her age who played concerts with her husband. Their friendship eventually grew into a romance.Sierkierski p. xviii Beginning in 1895, Rosen attempted to annul her first marriage with G√≥rski, on grounds that her father had not given the necessary consent to the marriage (since she was then a minor) and that the marriage ceremony had occurred in a parish to which neither spouse belonged.S≈Çawomir Koper, Private life of the elite of the Second Republic, Bellona 2011, p. 188-189. Shortly after receiving the annulment, Helena and Ignacy married in Warsaw on May 31, 1899.  Social activist Shortly after their marriage, Paderewski bought a villa, Riond-Bosson, near Morges, Switzerland, where he recovered from his worldwide concert tours, and they both experimented with new farming and husbandry techniques. She raised prize- winning purebred chickens at Riond-Bosson and donated 300 for breeding by the Warsaw Agricultural Society, as well as founded an agricultural school to teach Polish country girls poultry farming and gardening techniques in Julin in northeast Poland.Sierkierski p. 79 Paderewski also owned a large estate in Galicia and a property near Nyon on the shores of Lake Geneva, and circa 1913 bought two ranches near Paso Robles, California, where they spent summers in a nearby hotel, as well as cultivated walnuts, almonds and plums (processed into prunes).Sierkierski pp. xix, 23-25 Mr and Mrs Paderewski at Philadelphia Emergency Aid Benefit 1916 By 1910, Paderewski was wealthy and famous both as a philanthropist and musician. He had embraced the new phonograph and sound recording technologies (like the opera star Enrique Caruso and the violinist Fritz Kreisler), as well as performed at concerts throughout Europe, the United States, Australia, South America and South Africa.Sierkierski p. xiii While he met with the powerful and courted wealthy donors for various charities they supported (some by specific concerts), Paderewska wrote letters and appeals, met with grassroots workers and parish priests, and handled marketing and money. Among her projects was a club for Warsaw's newspaper boys, and a home for elderly female veterans (including of the failed January Uprising of 1863 against Russia and the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905-1907)). Her husband, Paderewski, also became involved in Polish affairs. Noting that Russia forbad erection of a statute to the national poet Adam Mickiewicz on the 100th anniversary of his birth, Paderewski refused invitations to perform in Moscow and St. Petersburg. After Prussia forbad the proposed erection of a statue honoring the Polish and Lithuanian warriors who won the Battle of Grunwald against the Teutonic Knights 500 years earlier (which Paderewski said he dreamed about since he was 14 years old), Paderewski proudly refused multiple invitations to perform again in Berlin. Paderewski also substantially funded both monuments, which the Austro-Hungarian Empire permitted in Kracow, Poland's historic capital (and a \\"free city\\" after the Napoleonic Wars, annexed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1846 and thereafter the capital of its province \\"Galicia\\").Sierkierski p. xix In erecting these monuments, Paderewski became associated with Roman Dmowski, president of the Polish Club of Petrograd and leader of the Polish members of the Russian Duma, but whose anti-Semitism would later become an issue used against Paderewski in the United States.Sierkierski pp. 14-17, 21-23 As World War I's hostilities began in late July 1914, the Paderewskis were celebrating his name day and her birthday with their customary gathering of friends, musicians and politicians at their Swiss home. Their funds (and especially those of their Polish friends) were frozen in Lausanne (although they managed to live on credit), and travel became difficult. They hosted about 50 people for several weeks, and Lausanne became a gathering place for Polish exiles. In November 1914, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas reportedly promised Polish independence after the war, but Paderewski feared it a ruse to quiet rampant unrest, and began working with Erasmus Piltz, Henry Sienkiewicz, Wincenty Lutoslawski, J√≥zef Wierusz-Kowalski, Jan Kucharzewski and other Polish exiles for Polish relief.Sierkierski pp. 32-40 In January 1915, Paderewski planned a three-month trip to Paris, London and the United States, initially thinking he and his wife could lobby for Polish relief, as well as continue his concert career. However, they soon realized the difficulty of the task they had undertaken. Russia's ambassador in Paris, Count Alexander Izvolsky, was anti-Polish, though a politically necessary member of any relief committee of Polish exiles in that country. Meanwhile, Paderewska through contacts with Mildred Barnes Bliss, Denys Cochin and Wladyslaw Mickiewicz was able to visit Polish conscript prisoners from the German army, as well as start a doll-making project among nearly destitute Polish students and artisans in Paris. For the next several years, she hauled trunks of dolls and sold them in conjunction with her husband's concerts to develop profits to buy milk for Polish babies and do other good works. In London, Russia's ambassador Count Alexander Benckendorff assisted Paderewski's Polish relief efforts both in Britain and its overseas colonies. However, the English public knew little about Poland, so Paderewski began writing letters to newspaper editors, which some published. Thus began his role as Polish spokesman. In April 1915, the Paderewskis boarded the transatlantic steamship Adriatic for the United States, but the sinking of the Lusitania the following month transformed their short trip into one of more than three years.Sierkierski pp. 41-51Dolls made by WW1 Polish refugees in France for sale through Helena Paderewska In the United States, the Paderewskis made a hotel in New York City their base, but spent possibly more nights aboard overnight railway cars, not only traveling for benefit performances (during which his wife sold dolls as well as signed autographs), but also to meet the Polish community in the United States (and get them to overcome their various hostilities to Prussia or Russia or loyalty to the broken Austro-Hungarian Empire). Paderewski advocated Poland's cause before his concerts, and also used his fame to meet key politicians and influencers, thus becoming a key spokesman in exile for Poland. He developed a relationship with Col. Edward M. House, who became a key aide of President Woodrow Wilson, and also became acquainted with future President Herbert Hoover (who initially worked to evacuate Americans trapped by the conflict and later coordinated aid in Europe). Wilson endorsed the idea of an independent Polish state immediately before his election in 1916, and chose not to block (and eventually endorsed) Paderewski's idea of an army of Polish exiles, initially proposed as Kosciuszko's Army, and later called the Blue Army or Haller's Army, which France endorsed and Canada permitted to train. The Paderewskis made many trips to Chicago (the headquarters of several Polish organizations) and in August 1918 a thousand Polish emigrant delegates from North American (of all political persuasians) met in Detroit and agreed to raise ten million dollars to benefit Poland. However, by September 1917, the press of Polish affairs forced Paderewski to stop further concerts.Sierkierski pp. 55-117 During their three years of travels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, Helena Paderewska organized help for the war's victims in Poland, as well as for Polish soldiers, who first fought in France and later on the Eastern Front.Helena Paderewska, Paderewski: The Struggle for Polish Independence (1910-1920) , ed. Ilias Chrissochoidis (Stanford, Brave World, 2015), pp. 130-134. With the help of Polish emigrants in the United States, Paderewska founded the Polish White Cross in February 1918 (initially the Red Cross would not permit use of its name since Poland was not a country), and also helped found the Relief Society for Intelligence.Lexicon of Polish History from 1995, p. 543 First lady Poland briefly regained its independence as the war ended on November 11, 1918, in what became known as the Second Polish Republic. As transatlantic crossings again became safe, the couple steamed to London, where (after overcoming lodging problems) the British Foreign Office asked Paderewski go to Warsaw and help establish a stable government, necessary if Poland were to have representatives at the upcoming peace conference. After brief consultations with Mr. Dmowski in Paris (where the Peace Conference would begin), the Paderewskis and Major Iwanowski (Paderewski's secretary) embarked on a British cruiser, escorted by a destroyer, for Gda≈Ñsk. After a snowstorm delay, they reached Poland on Christmas Day. Enthusiastic crowds greeted the Paderewskis in Gda≈Ñsk and again in Posnan after a train trip the following day, although retreating Prussian authorities had opposed Paderewski's stops in either city. Moreover, Paderewski had caught a cold during the stormy sea voyage, so Paderewska took his place on the reviewing stand for the children's parade, only to learn that some Prussian soldiers were firing upon Poles elsewhere in the city. Paderewski survived an assassination attempt (bullets shot into their hotel room) before they left for Kalisz (destroyed by Prussia early in the war). Travel proved slow as Polish soldiers cleared the rail line to Warsaw, plus in every village en route people greeted them with flowers, bread and salt. Despite arriving at Warsaw at 1a.m., a crowd of peasants wearing national costumes unyoked the carriage's horses in order to pull the Paderewskis the mile to their hotel through another massive crowd.Siekierski pp. 123-134 However the political situation remained chaotic, and not only because the country had been devastated by years of war. Many people lacked food, as well as boots and proper winter clothing. Despite speedy diplomatic recognition from the United States, Poland faced border disputes, particularly in Silesia with the Czechs. Russian Bolsheviks continued to fight in the north and east, and Ukrainian Bolsheviks besieged Lwow/Lemberg. On January 5‚Äì6, a bloodless failed coup led the unpopular leftist Jedrej Moraczewski government to resign, though J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski remained Poland's temporary chief of state. Furthermore, personal threats against Paderewski by radical elements greatly worried Paderewska, though her husband responded \\"there is no place in politics for a man who is afraid of death.\\" From January 16 to December 9, 1919, Paderewski became the Second Republic's Prime Minister (technically president of the Council of Ministers), and Foreign Minister as well for a slightly longer time. In Poland's first elections, he had been elected from Warsaw and Lublin, and accepted the former seat.Siekierski pp. 145-146 Helena Paderewska accompanied him during many of these meetings, and government business was conducted at their hotel homes. She also influenced her husband's policy, and that involvement became a focus for criticism by some afraid to attack her husband directly (somewhat akin to the later Eleanor Roosevelt). During their seven months in Paris, Paderewska became one of the few women present at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919 (her husband being Poland's signatory) and also witnessed the signing of the Treaty of St. Germain (which formally ended hostilities with the Austro-Hungarian empire) in September before they returned to Warsaw.Siekierski pp. 135-143 However, Paderewski resigned his positions in December, his health having failed after further elections failed to produce a majority government. They returned to their Swiss home, where Paderewska wrote her memoirs of the previous decade with the assistance of native English speakers.Siekierski pp. 166-172 The following year (1920), Paderewski briefly represented Poland at the League of Nations in New York, while war continued with Russia and Ukraine, and the Red Army nearly captured Warsaw. However, the World War had also destroyed Paderewski's fortune, so he resigned that position in 1921, resumed his musical concerts in 1922, and world tours beginning in 1924. In 1924, the year of his last personal visit to Poland, Paderewski also sold his interest in the Warsaw daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita and ended his political career.Siekierski pp. 173-174 On January 18, 1919, all organizations working on Polish soil that followed the ideals of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement gathered, and soon amalgamated as the Polish Red Cross Society. Paderewska had participated as leader of the Polish White Cross. The Polish government soon approved the new entity, and a few months later - after the aristocratic first president Pawe≈Ç Sapieha (1860-1934) resigned - Paderewska became the relatively new society's president. She continued in the position until 1926, although she last visited Poland in 1924. Paderewska also supported the Polish YWCA, and was an honorary member of Polish Women's Alliance of America. In 1921 Pope Benedict XV awarded Paderewska the pontifical cross for her humanitarian work.  Death and legacy  During the final two years of her life, Helena Paderewska suffered several illnesses. Her husband, Ignacy Paderewski, canceled his winter tour of the United States in order to comfort her in her final days. Helena Paderewska died in Switzerland on January 16, 1934 at the Paderewski estate Riond-Bosson in Tolochenaz near Morges. Her husband buried her at Cimeti√®re des Champeaux in Montmorency, Val-d'Oise near Paris next to his Alfred (1880‚Äì1901).

Allied International, Inc., 456 U.S. 212 (1982), was a United States Supreme Court case which held that a trade union that refused to unload cargo from the Soviet Union in protest against the invasion of Afghanistan had engaged in a secondary boycott, an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act..  Background  Allied International was an importer of wood products from the Soviet Union and had contracts with a shipping firm to bring the products to the United States. The shipping company in turn contracted a stevedoring company to unload the cargo, whose workers were members of the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA). In 1980, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the ILA had resolved not to load or unload Soviet cargo destined for US ports. As a result of this boycott, Allied's shipping was disrupted and the company had to renegotiate its contracts. Allied International sued the union.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Powell rejected the ILA's defense, noting; as understandable and even commendable as the ILA's ultimate objectives may be, the certain effect of its action is to impose a heavy burden on neutral employers. It is just such a burden, as well as widening of industrial strife, that the secondary boycott provisions were designed to prevent. The Court argued that while ILA claimed to be boycotting the Soviet Union, it was in effect boycotting a third party (the employer). The Court viewed the boycott as a political act, rather than economic. It dismissed claims that of First Amendment protection, as the petition clause relates to expression towards domestic government, not foreign.  Subsequent developments  John Rubin, writing on the significance of the case, noted: Julius Getman, writing at the time as Professor of Law at Yale University, noted the incongruity in the Court's reasoning between this case and NAACP v.

Mraoviƒá was a hierarch from Vojvodina before moving to Serbia in 1843, and eventually taking over the post of the sacked Metropolitan of Belgrade Mihailo Jovanoviƒá. Biography Teodosije studied philosophy in Budapest and theology at Sremski Karlovci and entered a monastic order at the Rakovica Monastery, near Belgrade. As there were no bishops in Serbia proper willing to consecrate him as the Metropolitan, he was forced to return to northern Serbian lands, then under Austrian rule, in Sremski Karlovci, where patriarch German Anƒëeliƒá, with the express approval of the Austrian Emperor, performed the necessary rites. The Serbian bishops were subsequently replaced with new appointees: another professor of the Belgrade Seminary, Nestor, born in Kragujevac, was appointed Bishop of Ni≈°; the Sremski Karlovci born archimandrite of the Hopovo Monastery, Samuilo, was sent to ≈†abac while Kornelije (Cornelius), the administrator of the Ravanica Monastery, in Serbia, was elevated to the Bishopric of U≈æice. As far as the deposed Metropolitan Mihailo Jovanoviƒá was concerned, this new Church administration, unlawfully elected and appointed, was uncanonical according to Serbian ecclesiastical law (Zakonopravilo) despite the blessing given by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople in 1884. By then (1884), the Bishop of Ni≈°, Nestor, died. He was replaced by Dimitrije Pavloviƒá,while the Eparchy of U≈æice was renamed the Eparchy of ≈Ωiƒça with its seat in ƒåaƒçak. The bishop of ≈†abac, Samuilo, died in 1886, and at that point, the Eparchy of ≈†abac was added to the Belgrade Metropolia, while the Eparchy of Negotin was simply abolished. By 1886 Serbia was divided into only three dioceses -- Belgrade, Ni≈°, and ≈Ωiƒça. The whole period of Prince Milan Obrenoviƒá's rule of Serbia was an extremely trying time for the country, the people, and the Serbian Orthodox Church in particular. His predecessor, Russian-educated Metropolitan Mihailo Jovanoviƒá, sacked for being pro-Russian by the Serbian government that favored Austrian rapprochement instead.returned in 1889 and harmony in the church was brought back. Metropolitan Teodosije (Mraoviƒá) and his bishops were all secret admirers of Metropolitan Mihailo (Jovanoviƒá), and they readily gave up their appointments in the interest of the restoration and normalization in the life of the Church. Also, Teodosije advised his bishops to tell their subordinate clergy to stay above politics, and remain only God's servants.

He was conscripted into the army in 1917, but was demobilised in 1919 and returned to the factory. He was elected to the local executive of the union, and was a leading figure in the factory occupations of 1920. Bitossi was a founding member of the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I), and was elected to the executive of its Florence branch, but in 1924 repeated attacks by Fascists led him to move to Lyon. There, he organised politically among other Italian immigrants, and was co-organiser of the PCd'I conference in the city in 1926. In 1927, he secretly moved to Milan to work for the party's executive, but he was arrested and imprisoned until 1932. On release, Bitossi returned to communist activism, this time in Tuscany and Emilia, but he was again arrested in 1934 and confined to Ponza. He organised lectures there, and was not released until 1943. He then returned to Florence and organised armed resistance to the Fascists, and spent a brief period as deputy mayor of the city. He was also elected as chair of the city's Chamber of Labour, and to the executive of the new Italian General Confederation of Labour (CGIL). In 1946, Bitossi was appointed as deputy secretary of CGIL, and moved to Rome; he was also elected to the central committee of the PCd'I.

It is a pest of cotton, okra, and other crops in southern Asia. Description The adult cotton jassid is a long and slender insect about in length. It is yellowish-green, with a conspicuous black spot on either side of the head and another near the tip of the fore wing. The head is pale green and the membranous wings transparent and iridescent. On leaf surfaces, the insect tends to move about diagonally, and when disturbed it immediately jumps and flies away. Life cycle Leafhoppers undergo direct development from nymph to adult without undergoing metamorphosis. On okra, eggs are mainly oviposited inside the tissue of leaf blades, but may also be laid in leaf stalks or in soft twigs. The eggs hatch in six or seven days. There are five nymphal instars, developing over a period of about seven days. Total lifespan is about one month, with females living a little longer than males. The fecundity of females is about fifteen eggs. Ecology Leafhoppers have mouthparts designed for piercing and sucking, enabling them to feed on plant sap. In India, this jassid feeds on sap from a wide range of plants including cotton, okra, eggplant, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, and sunflower throughout the year, and on pigeon pea and cowpea during the monsoon season. It also occurs on various grasses, including lawns of Bermuda grass. Damage Heavy infestations on cotton, okra, and sunflower make the leaves turn yellow, curl up and fall off. The insects also secrete honeydew, and sooty mould often grows on this, restricting the amount of light reaching the plant's photosynthetic surfaces and reducing the yield. In many areas, this pest regularly occurs on cotton in epidemic numbers. A number of natural enemies help to control populations including ladybirds, predatory lygaeid bugs, and several species of mantis. Neem oil can be used as a biopesticide. Control On cotton, it has been found that growing a cultivar with hairs on the undersides of the leaves reduces infestation, and that long hairs are better at deterring the insect from laying than are short hairs; this seems to be due to the hairs preventing the insect from getting close enough to the leaf surface to deposit its eggs.

Early life  Scorah grew up as a third-generation Jehovah's Witness in Vancouver, Canada with her parents and sister. She rarely had contact with non-Jehovah's Witnesses. She forwent a formal education and career, and instead went into the full-time volunteer preaching work immediately after graduating high school. She says, \\"If the world is ending, why would you go to college?...Why would you get a career?\\" When she was 19 years old her congregation elders disfellowshipped her for having premarital sex, and she was immediately shunned by her family and friends. While she was disfellowshipped she continued to abstain from associating with \\"worldly people,\\" except for necessary contact at work or the grocery store. She recalls frequently \\"losing [her] voice\\" after long weekends in her apartment with zero human contact. Two years later the elders approved her appeals for reinstatement, at which point her family and friends stopped shunning her. When she was 22 years old she married a Jehovah's Witness elder, then she and her husband moved to China to become missionaries.  Education  As a young adult, Scorah forwent a formal education after high school (see early life above). In 2010 she enrolled in college at CUNY's Brooklyn and Hunter colleges. She took a break in 2015, then resumed her studies in spring 2019. She is currently enrolled in CUNY BA's program for Unique and Interdisciplinary Studies. She is concentrating in the Psychology of Religion at Hunter College's program in religion, under the guidance of faculty member Barbara Sproul.  ChinesePod and \\"Dear Amber\\"  Scorah is a fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese and has lived in both Taiwan and China, where she became immersed in Chinese culture.https://www.amberscorah.com/about Between the years 2007 and 2009 she hosted a ChinesePod series called \\"Dear Amber\\" where she answered listeners' questions about China and discussed unique aspects of Chinese culture and customs which foreigners may not be aware of. ChinesePod describes Scorah as a \\"pioneer\\" for developing this new lesson style.  Child care and parental leave advocacy  In 2015 Scorah's three-month-old son Karl Towndrow died unexpectedly on his first day of daycare in SoHo, New York. The daycare had been operating without a license and was shut down shortly after the incident. A staff member stated that she had noticed Karl kicking in his crib but she was told by a supervisor to ignore it because that's what babies do. He was found unresponsive with \\"blue lips\\" a short time later, and pronounced dead at the hospital. Scorah had not felt ready to go back to work and leave him at daycare, which made the incident particularly difficult to cope with. She walked into the daycare and witnessed a staff member administering CPR \\"incorrectly,\\" despite their earlier assurances that the staff was properly trained to administer CPR. She later found out that he had been put to sleep on his side. Since the official cause of death was \\"undetermined,\\" she does not know if it could have been prevented; however, she regrets that her son had to die alone without his mother. The incident drove her into activism. = Letter grading = In a joint press conference with senators Jeffrey D. Klein and Diane Savino, Scorah and her partner Lee Towndrow pushed for the city and state of New York to institute a letter grading system for child care facilities. She feels that a letter grading system could prevent more deaths in the future because parents would have more tools available to assess a given daycare's safety and qualifications. = Paid parental leave = Scorah authored a \\"viral\\" article for The New York Times Motherlode blog about the incident from her perspective. In it she explained why she thinks mandatory paid parental leave is necessary. She says, \\"Parental leave reduces infant death, gives us healthier, more well-adjusted adults and helps women stay in the workforce.\\" First lady Michelle Obama was so moved by her story that she sent a letter of condolence to Scorah. Soon thereafter Barack Obama's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett made a push for legislation mandating paid family leave. In February 2016 Scorah attended New York City mayor Bill de Blasio's speech where he discussed his policy mandating 6 weeks' paid parental leave for non-union city employees, and pushed for the policy to be made available throughout the state of New York. Scorah called this policy change a \\"baby step.\\" In August 2016 Scorah delivered petitions to both the Trump and Clinton presidential campaigns pushing for federally mandated paid leave. Both politicians have spoken favorably of the concept. Donald Trump pitched a plan for how he could institute 6 weeks' paid parental leave. Scorah says this is progress but it's not enough. In 2017 CNN correspondent Clare Sebastian named Amber as her \\"hero\\" for \\"...her bravery in turning such a tragic event into public and heartfelt campaign.\\" That same year Brooklyn Magazine named her one of their top \\"100 Influencers in Brooklyn Culture\\" for her parental leave advocacy.  Coping after the death of a child  In May 2019 she wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times entitled \\"Surviving the Death of My Son After the Death of My Faith\\". She says, \\"Several years after leaving my religion, I felt sure I had encountered all the situations I might possibly need to get used to in my new life. What I had not prepared myself for was death...And then my baby died.\\" She describes the pain of trying to cope without the hope of resurrection, and the awkwardness of accepting condolences from religious people. In June she wrote another article for The New York Times entitled \\"Having a Child After Losing a Child\\", where she describes the complex emotions that came with having a second child less than a year after losing her first. The final chapter of her memoir Leaving the Witness recounts the period of time surrounding Karl's death. Reviewer C.E. Morgan says of this chapter, \\"her description of that loss in terse, blunted prose is deeply moving...Given the enormity of her grief and the wholesale collapse of her previous belief system, the intellectual integrity that Scorah displays is nothing short of a miracle.\\"  High-control groups  Scorah began speaking out publicly about her life as a Jehovah's Witness in 2013 in her article Leaving the Witness: A Preacher Finds Freedom To Think In Totalitarian China published by The Believer magazine. In it she speaks about her restrictive childhood and disfellowshipment as a teenager, her life as an illegal missionary in China (see persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in China), her gradual change of belief, and her eventual apostasy trial and shunning. In 2019 she expounded on this story in her memoir Leaving the Witness. The Daily Shows Trevor Noah told her, \\"You truly believed in a way that I find admirable...you left America and moved to China to preach...where its illegal to do that...What's really beautiful, though, is when you start witnessing the change. Because you go out to be a missionary to these people out there to tell them about being a Jehovah's Witness, and in a strange way its almost like they start converting you.\\" ExJW activist Lloyd Evans expresses how the book is \\"fascinating\\" even to former Jehovah's Witnesses because, \\"Jehovah's Witnesses still think of China as 'the frontier'...everything is done under- cover...you're lifting lid on this very kind of unknown element of Witness life, even to Witnesses.\\" Scorah has attracted the attention of former members of other high-control groups, such as Dr. John Dehlin of Mormon Stories Podcast. He interviewed Scorah and mused on the similarities between the two groups, especially \\"surrounding the struggle to form a new identity after leaving.\\" Amber did multiple speaking engagements in 2019 about high-control groups, including a TEDx Talk entitled What Cults Tell Us About Ourselves.

Early life He was the second son of four children born to Lady Beatrice Violet Graham and Algernon Greville, 2nd Baron Greville, who married in 1863. His older brother, Ronald Greville, died in 1908. His younger sisters were Hon. Camilla Dagmar Violet Greville (wife of Hon. Alistair George Hay, son of the Earl of Kinnoull) and Hon. Lilian Veronique Greville (wife of Cmdr. Herbert Victor Creer). His father was a Liberal MP for Westmeath who was appointed a Groom in Waiting to Queen Victoria in 1869 and, from 1873 to 1874, served as a Lord of the Treasury in Gladstone's government. His paternal grandparents were Fulke Greville-Nugent, 1st Baron Greville and his wife, Lady Rosa Nugent (the only daughter and heir of the George Nugent, 1st Marquess of Westmeath). His maternal grandparents were James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose and the former Hon. Caroline Agnes Horsley-Beresford (third daughter of John Horsley- Beresford, 2nd Baron Decies). Career From 1893 to 1895, Greville served as Aide-de-camp to the Earl Cadogan, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, followed by Aide-de-camp to Lord Northcote, the Governor of Bombay from 1900 to 1904. From 1904 to 1908, he served as Military Secretary to the Governor-General of Australia. From 1899 to 1905, he was a Captain with the 7th Queen's Own Hussars. From 1914 to 1918 during World War I, he was a Major with the Lovat Scouts. From 1914 to 1943, he was chairman of St George's Hospital. In 1919, he was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. As his older brother, Ronald, died without issue in 1908, succeeded to his father's barony upon his death in 1909. The Greville estate aggregated to 20,000 acres across England. Personal life In February 1909, his mother, Lady Violet (who died in 1932), wrote about the decadence of British society, blaming American brides. \\"'This,' she writes, 'has struck at the root of our family life and introduced a new element into the simplicity and dignity of old-fashioned households. The rich American has no traditions; no prejudices in favor of old customs, duties, or responsibilities; she is essentially irresponsible, and measures everything by one standard only--money. The result permeating through all classes has considerably increased luxury and made for independence. It has, far more than any suffragette movement, given liberty to women to do as they like; for the American regards her husband as an inferior being, made to work for her, and to lavish pleasures and gifts as a reward for her beauty and sprightliness.'\\" At the time, it was thought to be a criticism of the marriage of Lord Granard to Beatrice Mills. Nine months later on 24 November 1909, Charles was married to American heiress Olive (n√©e Grace) Kerr (1876‚Äì1959) at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge. Olive was more than twenty minutes late to the wedding due to the breakdown of her car on the way to the ceremony. The wedding was in London, followed by a large reception at the Carlton House Terrace home of Freddie Guest and his American wife, Amy Phipps (a daughter of Henry Phipps Jr.), which the Greville's had rented for a year. The guests at the wedding included Prince Alexander of Teck. Olive, the widow of banker Henry S. Kerr (from whom she inherited $1,000,000), was a daughter of John W. Grace of Leybourne Grange in Kent (formerly the seat of the Hawley baronets) and a niece of Michael P. Grace and Mayor William Russell Grace, founder of W. R. Grace and Company. Together, Olive and Charles were the parents of: * Ronald Charles Fulke Greville, 4th Baron Greville (1912‚Äì1987), who died unmarried. Lord Greville died on 14 May 1952 and was succeeded in the barony by his only son, Ronald. Upon Ronald's death in 1987, the barony of Greville became extinct. Lord Greville, Charles Beresford Fulke Greville had two sons. The second son Peter Charles Algernon Ascroft Greville was born in 1916 at Ankerwycke Priory. The mother who was separated from her husband was Cecil Enid Violet Ascroft (formerly Greville), Lord Greville's niece and the daughter of Major Brooke Southwell Greville, Kings Messenger. They both worked at the War Office and the Greville families closely socialised together.

The book is a revised and enlarged version of The Cobra Story, covering the Cobra's successes in 1965 and 1966, as well as including technical specifications for the 289 and 427 Cobras. Background In the autobiography, Shelby discusses his life changing win at Le Mans in 1966 with driver Ken Miles against rival car manufacturer, Ferrari. He also describes his days as a race car driver, the challenges, the victories, and the crashes ‚Äî the worst of which he describes as an ‚Äúexplosion.‚Äù He talks about his philosophies on racing such as, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to go around worrying about getting killed, you might as well give up racing.‚Äù He writes two chapters about how he won the race at Le Mans in 1959, saying, ‚ÄúIt knocks the hell out of a driver and it knocks the hell out of a car.‚Äù The memoir also discusses the genesis for the revolutionary car he created, the Shelby Cobra. Reception The contemporary review of The Cobra Story by Kirkus Reviews stated, \\"The lanky Texan's autobiography is short on grammar but long on building motors, racing frames and surviving hairbreadth escapes (one wreck with a Maserati cost him 72 stitches). He was early bit by the racing bug and even turned to airplanes for a while. He tells of the uncomfortable effect of racing on his marriage; his Air Corps service during WWII; and of the final big event when his Cobra beat the Ferrari, which had won for three years running. Shelby has none of the insight into racing which distinguishes Stirling Moss's books. And though he discusses motors far more intimately than the average reader will care about, his races often work up a real head of steam.\\" Film In 2020, the book was rereleased by Graymalkin Media for the opening of Ford v Ferrari (titled Le Mans '66 in the UK and other territories), a 2019 American sports drama film starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale. For his performance, Bale was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Drama and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role.

The team sat around a bonfire discussing a controversial idea for a new film. The film would be loosely based on a true story about a childhood family friend of Huculiak's. It wasn't until June 2016, while the film was still in pre-production, that the team determined that the story they were crafting would be set amongst a violent wildfire in the Canadian wilderness, and so prior to any casting, and without a finished script, Joseph Schweers and Josh Huculiak drove into a wildfire to gather shots for the film. The film was finished in December 2017, and made its world premiere at the 2019 Vancouver International Film Festival. It is currently making an international film festival run.

The work's oroginal location is unknown, though its subjects' mean it was probably commissioned by a religious confraternity, possibly the Confraternity of the Virgin of Mount Carmel based at the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Brescia. The standard first appears in the historical sources in 1820, when Antonio Canova acquired it and the same artist's Madonna of Mount Carmel from the Ottoboni family in RomePier Virgilio Begni Redona, p. 122. In a letter written just after the acquisition, Canova attributed all three works to Pordenone and stated that they had originally come from Pissincana near Pordenone. On Canova's death it was inherited by his stepbrother Giovanni Battista Sartori, who placed the standard's two panels in the Tempio Canoviano in Possagno, but sent 'Madonna of Mount Carmel to the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, which in 1827 sent him two canvases by Jacopo Palma il Giovane in exchange.

Enc√º is well known for a speech that he gave on the floor of the Parliament in Ankara. In his speech, Enc√º criticized the Turkish Government for their violence and mistreatment of the Kurdish people. After delivering the speech, Enc√º was arrested and stripped of his parliamentary immunity.  Early life  Enc√º was born on August 5, 1985 in the Roboski district of the Sirnak Province of Turkey. He attended and graduated from high school in Turkey and speaks Kurdish at a very high level. In 2009, Enc√º began to study at the √áukurova University in Adana, Turkey, but took a break from education in order to focus on speaking for the victims of the Roboski airstrike after 2011. During the Roboski massacre, he lost 11 relatives. After, Enc√º began pursuing a political career in Turkey and on 7 June 2015, he was elected MP for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP). He was re-elected in the snap elections of 1 November 2015.  Political career and prosecution  In the years following the Roboski Airstrike, Ferhat Enc√º has been actively fighting for justice for the village of Roboski. Initially, Enc√º served as the official spokesperson for Roboski with the assistance of his younger brother Veli Enc√º, but Ferhat eventually pursued a career in Turkish government as a lawmaker so that he would be able to launch a legitimate official inquiry into the Roboski Massacre. Enc√º's membership in Turkish Parliament however was cut short in late 2016 when he was arrested and convicted of ‚Äúmaking propaganda for a terrorist organisation.‚Äù = Enc√º's Speech in Ankara = In early February, 2016, Ferhat Enc√º delivered a speech on the floor of the parliament in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. In his speech, Enc√º delivered very critical remarks about the Turkish Government and their mistreatment of Kurdish people, specifically referencing the Roboski Massacre and the Turkish government's ongoing conflict with the PKK. Enc√º's six minute long speech was constantly interrupted by members of Turkish Parliament yelled at Enc√º, accusing him of terrorist affiliation, treason and even threatening his life for his remarks against the Turkish government. Eventually, a brawl broke out on the floor of parliament as members of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) were reported to have been shoving Enc√º and accusing him of supporting a terrorist organization. Another report stated that punching and slapping was occurring as deputies reacted to the words of Enc√º. Prior to the speech, Enc√º had been known for his opposition to the Turkish government for their violence against the Kurds.  Arrest  In the years leading up to the speech that Enc√º delivered on the floor of Ankara, Enc√º had struggled with political and legal issues quite frequently. During the inquest against Enc√º following the Roboski massacre, he was accused of assault against the Uludere district's governor and was arrested and detained as a result. After his speech in Ankara, Enc√º was arrested and held in a pre- trial detention center until November, when Enc√º was officially convicted of alienating the public from military service, terrorist propaganda, incitement to animosity, entering military prohibited zones, attempted murder of a public official for their duty. Following the conviction, Enc√º was stripped of his parliamentary immunity and imprisoned in the Kandira F-type prison.

Description In the world of the Castle of Magic, a monster has invaded Castle Bondi and killed the rulers of three adjoining countries. The players take on the roles of wizards who have come to the castle to try to recover the slain rulers' lost items of power: a bell, a book and a candle. The game comes with the following components: * 8-page rulebook * 24-page book of player tracking sheets * 20\\" x 20\\" board * 64 playing cards * 16 wizard cards * other cardstock and plastic playing pieces * two 6-sided dice Gameplay =The board= The board has three tracks that players can move around: one represents the outside wall of the castle, one circles the wizard's tower, and one represents the wizard's tower. There are spaces for: * a 6-step progression track inside the Wizard's Tower for the ritual spell that will end the game * places for the counters representing the three Items of Power (until each of them is claimed by a player) * Places for the three countries, indicating which Item of Power controls which country * three double-ended tracks ‚Äî one for each ritual element (bell, book, candle) ‚Äî that lead to one of two conditions for each element. (The bell is either silent or ringing, the book is fully closed or fully open, the candle is either unlit or fully lit.) * places for eight ritual result markers (Book Open, Book Closed, etc.) =Object of game= Players move their pawns around the board, gaining spell points that will enable them to: * learn which Item of Power controls which of the three countries * control the Item of their choice * learn which ritual result will be the most advantageous to them * control the three ritual elements Players use the Tracking Sheets to keep track of the spell points they've earned, their Combat rating, how many points of control they have over each Item of Power, what Ritual Spell configurations they've discovered, and what secrets they have learned about other players. Play continues until the Ritual Spell occurs, which can happen in one of two ways: # The counter on the countdown track inside the Wizard's Tower reaches the end # Markers on the three double-ended Ritual Element tracks all reach either one end of the track or the other When either of these conditions occurs, the game ends, and the result of the Ritual Spell ‚Äî one of eight potential results ‚Äî is revealed. =Victory conditions= Players gain or lose victory points depending on a number of factors: # If a player controls the Monster, if the Monster has been banished or if a player has been eaten by the Monster # Who controls which of the three countries, and therefore who controls which of the three Items of Power The person who accrues the most victory points wins, sharing that victory with any other player who had at least half as many victory points. However, if the result of the Ritual Spell is that the Monster eats everyone and rampages across the countryside, then everyone loses. (In the Advanced Rules, it is possible for a player to be the Monster, in which case, that player wins the game if this result is revealed.) Reception In the January 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue #189), Lester W. Smith found the game components well-made but extremely bland in design. However, he found the game \\"a lot of fun to play\\". He did warn that first-time players would be confused for a few turns until they figured out what was going on. Smith concluded, \\"The Castle of Magic game is not quite like anything I‚Äôve ever played before, and I find it highly entertaining.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1991 ","title":"Castle of Magic (board game)"},{"id":"62356325","text":"Micaela \\"Mica\\" Comberti (28 September 1952 ‚Äì 4 March 2003) was an English violinist. Her concert career lasted from 1977 until her death. Born to a German mother and an Italian father, she was taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna, the Royal Academy of Music and the Mozarteum University Salzburg. Comberti was involved in early music and played for The English Concert, St. James' Baroque, Ex Cathedra and the Collegium Musicum 90. She also taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music. An award and position at the Royal Academy of Music are named after the violinist. Biography Comberti was born to a German mother and an Italian father in London on 28 September 1952. She was known by the name Mica from an early age. Comberti demonstrated a talent for music from an early age; aged 19 she travelled to Vienna to study with the violinist Eduard Melkus at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna with her experiences directing her to historical performances. In 1970 Comberti performed with the jazz band Centipede run by the pianist Keith Tippett. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1972. Comberti spent the following three years under the tutelage of Manoug Parikian at the Royal Academy of Music, London. She subsequently went back to Vienna for two years and underwent further education at the Mozarteum University Salzburg as a pupil of S√°ndor V√©gh, whom had a profound influence on her life. Comberti had her interest in historical performance strengthened by attending the classes of Nikolaus Harnoncourt. She returned to the United Kingdom for a second time in 1977 to become involved in early music. Comberti played for a number of ensembles, record the scores of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Joseph Haydn with the Salomon Quartet from 1982 on and was principal player of The English Concert until 1990. Comberti left The English Concert in 1990 due to an increasing demand to raise her family and began to lead orchestras for the St. James' Baroque, and Ex Cathedra from 1987, and was a guest of other established groups. She played as a soloist with the Collegium Musicum 90 and recorded the Concerto for Two Violins for them. Comberti recorded the sonatas of Johann Sebastian Bach with the harpsichordist and long-time musical partner Colin Tilney. She taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and then at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music. Comberti was also associated with the Dartington Summer School and Festival. From 1999 on she trained the Bavarian State Opera in period style for several of its productions of Claudio Monteverdi and George Frideric Handel and enhanced the reputation of the opera for its performances of the latter composer within Germany. Comberti undertook a similar venture with the Hamburg State Opera in 2002. Her final public performance was with the violinist Simon Standage in February 2003. Personal life She was married to the violinist Gustav Clarkson, and had three children with him (two sons and a daughter). Comberti became ill while holidaying in August 2002 and was diagnosed with cancer. She followed a strict diet to lessen the effects of cancer and continued to teach through her illness. She died on 4 March 2003. Legacy Standage in his obituary of Comberti in The Guardian said Comberti was \\"at the forefront of an influential generation of British early musicians. As a zestful performer with an inquiring spirit and, more recently, as a thoughtful and dedicated teacher, she earned the affection and respect of colleagues and pupils alike.\\" A performance of Bach's St John Passion by Ex Cathedra at Lichfield Cathedral on 3 April 2003 was dedicated to her memory. The Micaela Comberti Chair for Baroque Violin at the Royal Academy of Music was established in September 2008 and is currently led by one of Comberti's pupils, Rachel Podger.

Early life and education Body, born at Cheriton Fitzpaine, Devonshire, on 7 January 1840, was son of Josiah Body, surgeon, by his wife Mary Snell. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, from 1849 to 1857, and subsequently entered St. Augustine's Missionary College, Canterbury. But his intention of undertaking missionary work abroad had to be abandoned owing to ill-health. In 1859 he matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge University, and graduated B.A. in 1862, proceeding M.A. in 1876. Subsequently, he received from Durham University the degree of M.A. ad eundem (1884) and that of hon. D.D. (1885). Career as clergyman Ordained deacon in 1863 and priest the following year, he served successively the curacies of St James, Wednesbury (1863-5), of Sedgeley (1865-7), and of Christ Church, Wolverhampton (1867-70). In these places he sought to bring the teaching of the tractarian movement home to the working classes and rapidly made a reputation as a mission preacher. Nominated rector of Kirby Misperton, Yorkshire, in 1870, he took an active part in the parochial mission movement. In 1883 he was appointed 'canon-missioner' of Durham by J. B. Lightfoot, bishop of the diocese, and for twenty-eight years carried on fruitful mission work among the Durham miners. Body's varied activities covered a wide area. He was proctor in convocation for Cleveland from 1880 to 1885, and for Durham in 1906, vice-president of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (1890), and warden of the Community of the Epiphany, Truro (1891-1905). He collected large sums for mission work, and, according to biographer Gabriel Stanley Woods, his \\"sermons were remarkable for the directness and sincerity of their appeal\\". He was select preacher at Cambridge (1892-4-6 and 1900-4-6), and lecturer in pastoral theology at King's College, London, in 1909. Body also acted as examining chaplain to the bishop of St Andrews from 1893 to 1908. Body combined evangelical fervour with tractarian principles. Although he was a member of the English Church Union, his sympathies were broad, and his conciliatory attitude during the church crisis concerning ritualism in 1898-9 exercised a moderating influence on the militant section of the high church party. In addition to many separate sermons, his published works were mainly devotional. Personal life and death Body married Louisa, daughter of William Lewis, vicar of Sedgeley on 25 September 1864. Two portraits were made of Body: a miniature painted by Mrs. Boyd and a black-and-white drawing by Lady Jane Lindsey. He died at the College, Durham, on 5 June 1911. His wife survived him with three sons and four daughters, among them, headmistress Agnes Body. In 1911 a memorial fund was raised for the maintenance of the diocesan mission house and of a home of rest for mission workers among Durham miners.

The revolt began in March 1915, and on 22 March a rebel army led by Djunaid-khan attacked the capital city, Khiva. An apparent pro-rebel Russian intervention to help Bakhshi Shah Murad escape arrest convinced Djunaid to renew the rebellion, and by 9 April several Khivan villages were under his control. In early June, Turkoman representatives were invited by Russia to join negotiations in a peace conference, but the distrustful chieftains halted 20 miles (32 km) northwest of Khiva, where they were attacked by the Khan's forces on 7 June. The revolt ultimately ended when Russian Major General Geppener arranged a peace agreement on 30 June 1915, wherein the Khivan government promised to take steps to remove the causes of the Yomud Turkoman's discontent.

Her 2019 book GOOD TO GO: What the Athlete in All of Us Can Learn From the Strange Science of Recovery, was a New York Times bestseller. She was awarded an American Association for the Advancement of Science Kavli Science Journalism Award in 2016 and serves on the board of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.  Early life and education  Aschwanden is the daughter of a United States Air Force fighter pilot. She was a high school track star. Aschwanden studied biology at the University of Colorado Boulder, where, alongside her studies, she was a professional cyclist. During her summers she interned at ScienceNOW, the web news service of the journal Science. After graduating she worked as a research assistant in a laboratory in Boulder. Whilst she briefly considered applying for a doctorate, she did not want to specialize. During her time as a researcher Aschwanden discovered the popular-science magazine New Scientist and decided that she would like to be a science journalist. She attended a science writing workshop in Santa Fe in 1996. She eventually studied science communication at University of California, Santa Cruz and graduated in 1998.  Career  Aschwanden is interested in the research process, and spent 2015 investigating whether science was ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. Her investigations considered scientific misconduct and fraud, and found that whilst these cases made headlines, they were a \\"mere distraction\\" from science itself. She has studied P-hacking, a method that involves narrowing or expanding data sets to prove a particular hypothesis. Scientific results are influenced by the analytical decisions of researchers, and whilst they are usually in \\"good faith\\", they can bias the way evidence is interpreted. She went on to show that the science of nutrition wasn't clean-cut; owing to difficulties in relying on self-reported diets, and how the act of self-reporting changes how one chooses food. During her investigations Aschwanden demonstrated that, to a certain p-value, eating shellfish was linked to being right handed and that eating cabbage was linked to having an innie bellybutton. Her reporting was the first to reveal the statistical and reproducibility issues in sports science, in particularly, concerns over magnitude-based inference (MBI). MBI is a statistical method that was developed by a group of Australian sport scientists. It has received widespread criticism for not being robust ‚Äì the sample sizes are too small and the conclusions are not backed up by enough evidence. In 2013, Aschwanden proposed the Finkbeiner test, a checklist to end gender bias in journalism. GOOD TO GO: What the Athlete in All of Us Can Learn From the Strange Science of Recovery, Aschwanden's first book, explored the science of exercise recovery. It looks at the tools that have been developed to optimize recovery, including nutrition, mental health and inflammation. The book made the New York Times Sports & Fitness best sellers list. She spent 2013 as a Carter Center Fellow, and 2014 as a Santa Fe Institute Journalism Fellow. In 2019 Aschwanden was the science writer in residence at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison where she spoke about the use and abuse of scientific evidence. Aschwanden produces the podcast Emerging Form, which discusses the creative process. She has spoken at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Her writing has appeared in Runner's World, The New York Times, The Washington Post and New Scientist. She serves on the board of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing, and was formerly the lead science writer for FiveThirtyEight. She has said that she liked working at FiveThirtyEight because she could create exciting infographics. = Awards and honors = * 2005 American Society of Journalists and Authors Best Article * 2007 American Society of Journalists and Authors Outstanding Essay * 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences Honourable mention for print journalism * 2013 National Association of Science Writers Science in Society Award * 2015 Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Magazine Journalism * 2015 American Association for the Advancement of Science Kavli Science Journalism Award * 2016 American Association for the Advancement of Science Silver Award * 2016 Information is Beautiful Award = Selected publications = * *  Personal life  Aschwanden is an endurance athlete.

(2019). An unusual bird (Theropoda, Avialae) from the Early Cretaceous of Japan suggests complex evolutionary history of basal birds. Communications Biology, 2(1). doi: 10.1038/s42003-019-0639-4  Discovery and naming  In 2013, the first associated skeleton of an Early Cretaceous bird from Japan was collected at the Kitadani Dinosaur Quarry in Katsuyama, Fukui, central Japan. Unlike many other Early Cretaceous bird specimens, the specimen was three-dimensionally preserved, and exhibited several autapomorphies, which lead to the creation of a new taxon. In 2019, the type species Fukuipteryx prima was named and described by Takuya Imai, Yoichi Azuma, Soichiro Kawabe, Masateru Shibata, Kazunori Miyata, Wang Min and Zhou Zhonghe. The genus name combines a reference to Fukui with an Ancient Greek pteryx, meaning \\"feather\\". The specific name means \\"the first\\" in Latin and refers to its basal position on the avialan phylogenetic tree. The holotype, FPDM-V-9769, was found in a layer of green sandstone from the Kitadani Formation that dates from the Aptian, about 120 million years old. It consists of a partial skeleton with a lower jaw. In total, a right surangular, two cervical vertebrae, four back vertebrae, two sacral vertebrae, five tail vertebrae, the pygostyle, ribs, a wishbone, both coracoid pelvis bones, the right ilium bone, the left upper arm bone, the ulna and radius of both forearms, the second right metacarpal, the left hand and both lower hindlimbs minus the calf bones and toes are preserved. The skeleton is not articulated but is preserved three-dimensionally. It is a subadult animal, less than one year old. It is part of the collection of the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum. The fossil was not fully prepared from its matrix and the bones were reconstructed via a CAT-scan.  Description  = Size and distinguishing features = Fukuipteryx was about the size of a modern pigeon. The describers were able to identify some distinctive features. They are autapomorphies (unique derived characters). The humerus has a round depression on the front top of its head. The shaft of the humerus is bent upwards (with the wing in a horizontal position). The pygostyle is robust with rudiments of neural spines still visible while the rear end has a paddle-shaped structure. = Skeleton = Fukuipteryx shows several derived traits that are an indication that it is not a very basal species, in the sense that it would be outside of the Avialae. A pygostyle, a fusion of the posterior tail vertebrae, is present, suggesting that the loss of a long tail is not an important step in the evolution of flight as was previously thought. The furcula is robust and U-shaped, but the angle between the branches is not very large. The coracoid is a long strut, not fused to the shoulder blade. The humerus is the largest bone of the limbs. The ulna and radius are longer than the femur.  Phylogeny  Fukuipteryx was placed basally in the Avialae. A cladistic analysis found a position below Jeholornis in the phylogeny, as the sister group to Pygostylia. The writers saw the Avialae as more derived than Archaeopteryx. This means that Fukuipteryx is the first basal avialan found outside of China.

From 1903 until 1918, she also wrote a weekly column for the Indianapolis News using the pseudonym of \\"The Country Contributor.\\" In addition, Strauss authored \\"The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman,\\" a monthly column for the Ladies' Home Journal from 1905 until 1918. A collection of her articles was published as The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman (1906). Strauss was a founder of the Woman's Press Club of Indiana in 1913, and in 1922, the group dedicated a statue in Strauss's honor at Turkey Run State Park in recognition of her effort to protect its natural beauty. Early life and education Juliet Virginia Humphries, the second of four daughters, was born in Rockville, Indiana, on January 7, 1863, to William and Susan (King) Humphries, who were pioneer farmers in rural Parke County, Indiana. Humphries' father gave her nickname of \\"Gypsy\\" (later shortened to \\"Gyp\\"). After William Humphries' death in 1867, Susan Humphrey raised their children on her own. Humphries attended local public schools in Rockville and was a lifelong resident of the town. She began writing for the Rockville Tribune newspaper while still in her teens. One of her first articles, \\"At the Rink,\\" was published in the Tribune in 1880 under the pseudonym of \\"La Gitani\\" (the gypsy). Marriage and family Juliet Humphries married Isaac R. Strouse on December 22, 1881. (Although her husband spelled his surname as Strouse, she always used the German spelling of Strauss.) In 1882 he became co-owner with John H. Beadle of the Rockville Tribune and the full owner of the newspaper in 1889. Julie and Isaac Strouse (Strauss) were the parents of two daughters. Their daughter, Marcia F. S. Ott, later became a columnist for the Rockville Republican. The family's home in Rockville was known to Strauss's readers as \\"Grouch Place.\\"Boomhower, p. 45. Career Strauss's career from 1893 to her death in 1918 included work as a newspaper and magazine columnist, author, and public speaker. Through her writing, she promoted the positive aspects of country life, rural traditions, motherhood, and a woman's role as a homemaker. Strauss also urged women to be themselves and pursue their own interests. Although Strauss staunchly supported women's traditional domestic roles and country life, her work took her into the public sphere. =Journalist= The demands of Strauss's home and family life limited her time for writing, but she was determined to pursue a career as a journalist.Boomhower, p. 43. Strauss began as an editorial columnist at the Rockville Tribune. Her regular weekly column, \\"Squibs and Sayings,\\" first appeared on February 9, 1893. The column's primary audience was women and it included her thoughts on daily life in rural Indiana. In addition to writing, Strauss was an associate editor at the Tribune and helped to manage it. Strauss's column at the Rockville Tribune contained a mix of stories ranging from commentary on magazine advertisements to women bicyclists and her humorous musings on married life. Although a rival newspaper in Rockville was critical of Strauss and her writing, the locals enjoyed it. She also received encouragement in the early years of her career from other Hoosier writers such as poet James Whitcomb Riley; author and editor John Clark Ridpath; and George S. Cottman, who founded in 1905 the quarterly publication, the Indiana Magazine of History. Cottman praised Strauss's ability to describe early life in Indiana, which was a special interest of hers.Boomhower, pp. 40‚Äì41 and 43. Beginning November 1903 and continuing until her death in 1918, Strauss wrote a regular weekly column for the Indianapolis News as \\"The Country Contributor.\\" Her first article in the News, \\"The Short and Simple Annals of the Poor,\\" was published on November 21, 1903. Her final weekly column, \\"In Defense of Exaggeration,\\" was published on May 25, 1918, two days after her death. Strauss's writing stressed the importance of a supportive home life and the joys of rural and small town life. She did not encourage women to become active in women's rights movement in the early twentieth century. Instead, Strauss was supportive of women's role in domestic life, but she also encouraged women to retain their individuality.Boomhower, pp. 43 and 45. The Ladies' Home Journal began publishing Strauss's monthly column, \\"The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman,\\" in November 1905. The column continued until her death in 1918 and gained her national attention as a journalist. Curtis Publishing Company also published a collection of her Journal columns as The Ideas of a Plain Country Woman in 1906. Edward Bok, editor of the Journal, reported in 1903 that the magazine had a circulation of more than a million readers. He later remarked that her articles were \\"widely read\\" and \\"more popular than the writings of any single contributor to the magazine.\\" =Conservation activist= During the mid-1910s, Strauss became an activist in efforts to protect the natural beauty of the outdoors and joined the nationwide conservation movement. Strauss especially loved the forests near her home in Rockville, Indiana, and was committed to protecting them. In April 1915 she reportedly wrote a letter to Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston asking him to save of land at Turkey Run (at that time called Bloomingdale Glens) in Parke County, Indiana, from timber harvesting. Her letter to Governor Ralston is believed to have prompted his decision to establish a Turkey Run Commission, which was assigned the task of preserving the forest. On April 27, 1915, the governor appointed Strauss to serve as a member of the commission. Strauss also urged Richard Smith, managing editor of the Indianapolis News, to help promote the effort to save Turkey Run. In addition, Indiana conservationist Richard Lieber was interested in protecting the state's forests and developing a state park system. In November 1915 Lieber met with Governor Ralston to discuss the possibility of establishing a state parks system as a permanent memorial to celebrate Indiana's centennial anniversary of its statehood. Ralston agreed to the proposal and appointed Leiber to the Turkey Run Commission in January 1916.Hoy, pp. 255 and 266.Lieber also served as chairman of the Committee on the Indiana State Centennial Memorial of the Indiana Historical Commission. See As members of the Turkey Run Commission, Strauss and Lieber lead the efforts to preserve Turkey Run as a state park.Hoy, p. 248. Strauss, Lieber, and their colleagues launched a public campaign to increase awareness and persuade members of the public to donate funds to purchase the land at Turkey Run.Hoy, p. 255. Strauss wrote articles appearing in the Indianapolis News and Rockville Tribune that described her experiences in rural Parke County and urged others to help preserve its natural landscape. She was also a donor to the park acquisition fund. The Turkey Run Commission merged with the State Parks Memorial Commission of the Indiana Historical Commission with the hope of acquiring the Turkey Run property, but the group failed in its first attempt to buy land for the new state park system. The Hoosier Veneer Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, acquired Turkey Run at public auction for $30,200 on May 18, 1916, outbidding the state parks commission by $100. In subsequent negotiations with the lumber company, the state government reached an agreement to purchase the land for $40,200 on November 11, 1916. Funds for the purchase largely came from private donations that included a major contribution of $5,065 from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Association and another $5,000 from auto racing enthusiast Arthur C. Newby.Hoy, p. 258.Silver, p. 53. Turkey Run became Indiana's second state park following the earlier acquisition in 1916 of McCormick's Creek Canyon in Owen County, Indiana, to create McCormick's Creek State Park. Death and legacy Strauss died on May 22, 1918. Her most notable legacy was the successful effort to save Turkey Run in Parke County, Indiana, and to establish Turkey Run State Park in 1916 as Indiana's second state park. In addition to her work as a conservation activist on behalf of Turkey Run, an Indianapolis News article in 1918, called her \\"one of the best known of Indiana writers.\\" Strauss was popular with her readers in Indiana, who considered her \\"as friend and counselor\\" according to the News at the time of her death. She was also nationally known for her articles in the Ladies' Home Journal. Her \\"down-to-earth\\" writing style covered of topics of interest to women and \\"celebrated the joys of being a homemaker.\\" Strauss was also a founding member in 1913 of the Woman's Press Club of Indiana. Honors and awards *In July 1922, the Woman's Press Club of Indiana dedicated a memorial statue and fountain in Strauss's honor at Turkey Run State Park. Created by Myra R. Richards, the sculpture was called Subjugation to reflect the \\"spirit of Strauss's writing‚Äìthe subjugation of the material to the spiritual.\\" *Strass was named to the Indiana Journalism Hall of Fame in 2001. *In 2012 the Indiana Historical Bureau erected a state historical marker at her former home at 514 North Street in Rockville, Indiana, to honor Strauss for her work as a journalist and efforts to preserve Turkey Run and make it a state park.

The locality preserves clay and mudstone fissure fills of a karst system eroded out of Ordovician limestone and dolostone. Fossils of terrestrial animals are abundant and well-preserved, representing one of the most diverse Paleozoic tetrapod communities known. A common historical name for the site is Fort Sill, in reference to the nearby military base. Fossils were first reported at the quarry by workers in 1932, spurring a wave of collecting by local and international geologists. Early taxa of interest included the abundant reptile Captorhinus and microsaurs such as Cardiocephalus and Euryodus. Later notable discoveries include Doleserpeton (one of the most lissamphibian-like Paleozoic tetrapods), the most diverse assortment of parareptiles in the Early Permian, and the rare early diapsid Orovenator.  Geology  The caves of Richards Spur formed in the Ordovician- age Arbuckle Limestone, which was uplifted, exposed, and tilted into a vertical orientation within the Pennsylvanian and Permian. In the early Permian, a karst system formed within the limestone, complete with caves containing speleotherms (stalagmites, stalactites, cave popcorn, etc.) made of calcite. Most of the karsts are narrow, 40‚Äì60 cm (16-24 inches) in width, and vertically oriented. Due to active mining at the site constantly destroying and exposing new layers, the layout of the system has not been recorded. Most of the Permian infill is discarded in the quarry's waste dumps without sedimentological and stratigraphic data, hampering studies into those aspects of the locality. However, it is known that the lower sections of the system (25 meters or 82 feet below the surface) lacks fossil material. Delorhynchus cifellii recovered from Richards Spur, showing the excellent preservation common to the site. Many of the fossils of Richards Spur were found in soft calcareous claystone or conglomerate. They likely ended up in the caves as a result of water runoff from the surface, as indicated by the presence of surface minerals such as quartz, kaolinite, and sulfides among the fossils. Individual organisms may have been already disarticulated by scavenging or decomposition on the surface, decomposed within the caves after the fresh corpse had been washed in, or even died within the caves after becoming trapped. Organisms which became disarticulated on the surface experienced more wear and erosion on their fossils, induced by exposure to the elements and transportation by water within and/or outside the karst system. On the other hand, recently deceased or living organism would have been more articulated due to their decomposition occurring in the more stable cave environment, with their tendons keeping their individual bones in place prior to fossilization. The most complete fossils were encased in a residue which was almost completely calcite, indicating that the cave structures precipitated around their skeletons. The caves likely had to have been submerged in water (or at least persistently humid) for active speleotherm formation, and therefore this mode of spectacular preservation, to have been possible. Some fossils are encrusted by pyrite, indicating the presence of anoxic fluids or diagenesis in the systems at some point. Most (but not all) fossils are stained a dark color by seepage of hydrocarbons into the deposits. These assorted biochemical conditions are the likely cause of unusually variable Carbon isotope values found within different preserved speleotherms.  Paleoenvironment  Isotope analysis of preserved speleotherms shows several regular fluctuations in Œ¥18O levels within a time span of 1-20 thousand years. Similar fluctuations in modern low-latitude environments are considered to be indicative of strong variation in precipitation between wet and arid periods on the scales of centuries or millennia. Some trace elements agree with this data, as Barium and Phosphorus concentrations increase with higher Œ¥18O (drier periods); this is explained by increased incorporation of dust and seafoam in drier, windier periods, as demonstrated by climatological analyses in a modern cave system in Israel. Other than exceedingly rare fragments of xenacanthids and eryopoids, aquatic animals are practically absent from Richards Spur. Although amphibians are common at the site, most of them are terrestrially-adapted taxa such as dissorophoids, microsaurs, and seymouriamorphs. This is in strong contrast to contemporary floodplain environments in Oklahoma and Texas, which have abundant fossils of aquatic animals like Eryops and Diplocaulus, along with large lowland amniotes like Edaphosaurus. As a result, the site is considered to represent animals living in a drier environment upland from the humid floodplains which preserve most of the Permian red beds. The only other productive Early Permian geological locale commonly considered to preserve an upland community is the Tambach Formation of Germany. = Age = The unique preservational environment of Richards Spur precludes geological stratigraphy. Based on the faunal composition (particularly the abundance of Captorhinus aguti, Cardiocephalus, and Euryodus), Richards Spur has been considered roughly equivalent in age to the Arroyo Formation (Lower Clear Fork) of Texas. In Oklahoma, the equivalent may be the upper Garber Formation or lower Hennessey Formation. The South Grandfield site of the Hennessey Formation is an example of a more typical Oklahoman fossil locale which has similar captorhinid and microsaur taxa to Richards Spur. To determine the absolute age of the Richards Spur deposits, the speleotherm studied for the Oxygen isotope and trace element analyses was also sampled for Uranium-Lead dating. It was determined that the speleotherm was formed between 289.68 and 288.32 million years ago. This time period was originally stated to be Sakmarian in age, but after a later refinement to the ICS timescale, it was specified as belonging to the early Artinskian. Two more speleotherms studied later gave date ranges of 283.8 to 289.6 Ma, and 286.0 to 286.4 Ma, indicating that the locality was deposited over several million years.

He is recognized as one of the pioneers of nanoscience in Israel. Banin is an associate editor of Nano Letters.  Biography and studies  Banin served in the Israeli Defense Forces as a captain of a Dabur-class boat. Following his military service, in 1986 Banin proceeded on to his academic career, receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry and physics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1989. He later received PhD from the Hebrew University, under the supervision of Sanford Ruhman in the field of femtosecond spectroscopy, studying the ultrafast dynamics of triiodide in solution.  Scientific career  In 1994 Banin joined the group of Paul Alivisatos in UC Berkeley as a postdoctoral researcher, studying the physical chemistry of semiconductor nanocrystals. In 1997 he joined the Institute of Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as a senior lecturer, becoming a full professor in 2004. In the early days of his independent career at the Hebrew University, Banin used tunneling spectroscopy techniques in order to study the electronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals, ultimately reporting the identification of atomic-like electronic states in 1999 in Nature. His later work has diverged in the directions of both synthesis of novel semiconductor- based nanomaterials, the physical characterization of such nanostructures, as well as various applications. In 2003 his group has reported the first successful growth of colloidal zinc-blende lattice III-V semiconductor nanorods. Continuing the work on III-V semiconductor nanocrystals, the group has published the synthesis of bright near-infrared-emitting core/shell nanocrystals, later employing them in a novel nanocrystal-polymer near- infrared light-emitting diode. In 2011 the group reported a simple procedure for the doping on nanocrystals, allowing the synthesis of heavily-doped p-type and n-type semiconductor nanocrystals. Some of his earlier works include the study of cadmium chalcogenide molecular clusters as a step between complexes and nanocrystals with semiconducting properties. Setting this work aside since 2002, his next paper on the subject was only in 2017 reporting magic sized InP and InAs clusters. Subsequent work on related clusters with the groups of Richard D. Robinson and Tobias Hanrath has finally lead to the discovery of the reversible isomerization of inorganic clusters ‚Äì a discovery made by chance during the shipping of the samples. This work was called \\"the final bridge\\" between molecules and nanocrystals. One of the most recognized contribution of Banin to the field of colloidal nanostrucutres is the first demonstration of selective metal growth on semiconductor nanocrystals, resembling well-known bulk systems such as the Schottky diode, and the subsequent refinement of related synthesis procedures and the discovery of similar structures, as well as the physical characterization of such systems. To this day, hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures are state-of-the-art systems in the field of photocatalysis. One of the breakthroughs made by Banin's lab, employing hybrid metal-semiconductor nanocrystals in water-based 3D printing and photopolymerization of common acrylates. It was also later shown that such approach can also be used for solvent-free photopolymerization and microprinting. Banin is widely recognized as a pioneer of nanoscience in Israel, founding the Harvey M. Kreuger Family Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology in 2001 and serving as its first director for nearly a decade until 2010. He was the chairman of the scientific committee and a co- chairperson of the first international nanoscience conference in Israel in 2009, now an internationally-recognized biennial conference. In 2009, Banin became the scientific founder of Qlight Nanotech, which was later fully acquired by Merck KGaA for an undisclosed price and is currently located in the campus of the Hebrew University in Givat Ram. In 2019 Nanosys signed an exclusive agreement on quantum dot patents developed in Banin's lab and held by Yissum. Banin has been an associate editor of the American Chemical Society journal Nano Letters since 2013. In 2020 he joined the Advisory Board of Nanoscale Horizons, a journal published by the Royal Society of Chemistry. As of 2020, Banin has authored more than 350 papers that have been cited more that 24,500 times, granting him an h-index of 80. In addition, he has invented more than 35 different patents.

She is the Horace B. Horton Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Chicago. Education After Gardel earned her bachelor‚Äôs degree in physics and mathematics from Brown University, she was accepted into physics graduate programs at Harvard University. While completing her PhD, she became interested in the ways actin deforms in response to external mechanical stress. She was encouraged by Clare Waterman and various cell biologists to leave her postdoc position and join a research team at Scripps Research Institute. She was later accepted as a Pappalardo Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to conduct independent research in the areas of biophysics.

Publication history Character Law, a 48-page softcover book written by S. Coleman Charlton and Peter C. Fenlon and published by Iron Crown Enterprises in 1982, is the original version of the Rolemaster character generation and development rules. In the 2014 book Designers & Dragons: The '80s, author Shannon Applecline related that after publishing several other rulebooks, \\"Finally, ICE produced Character Law (1982), a book that provided character creation rules. It tied the set of four books into a (somewhat) cohesive whole, as was shown when Spell Law, Arms Law, Claw Law, and Character Law were reprinted as a boxed set called Rolemaster (1982). A second edition was published in 1984. Contents =Character generation= In the first and second editions of this book, there are nineteen different character classes available that can be further customized according to spells and race chosen. The player starts by rolling percentile die ten times, then assigns these scores to the ten character abilities. The player then picks a race, applying racial bonuses to the appropriate scores, and chooses a character class. If the two primary abilities for the character class chosen are not already more than 90, the player raises them to 90. Every character in Rolemaster starts at 3rd level, so the player must decide how to design the first two levels to simulate the character's experiences thus far. =Character advancement= Character gain experience points for killing opponents, inflicting and receiving dmage during combat, casting spells, executing unusual or difficult tasks, having a religious experience, travel, and dying. In addition, the character can also be granted \\"idea points\\" if the character's idea or plan was successfully executed by the entire party. Unlike other role-playing systems where a character's skills are all raised when a level is gained, in the Rolemaster system, only a limited number of skills can be increased at each level; the player decides which skills will improve. Reception In the August 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue #88), although Arlen Walker liked the ability to move randomly generated ability scores around to produce the most beneficial results for the character class sought, he disagreed with the system of raising two character class abilities up to 90 if they were not already 90 or better. Walker felt this created a monochrome cast of characters and non- player characters. Walker liked the different ways that characters could gain experience points, such as travel, having religious experiences such as visions, and for coming up with a brilliant idea ‚Äî although he thought this one would probably lead to arguments over which player had originally voiced the germ of the idea. But he didn't like the idea that characters get experience points for dying, which he found \\"difficult to swallow.\\" He pointed out that this could lead to some unsavoury gamesmanship: \\"If your character dies and is brought back to life, he gets experience points equal to his own kill value. Yet, if the character is miraculously snatched back from the brink by an herb or healing spell, he gets only half the number of points. This could conceivably lead to a campaign in which characters would literally be dying to gain levels.\\" References Category:Rolemaster supplements ","title":"Character Law"},{"id":"62357191","text":"Milagros Benet de Mewton (n√©e Benet Col√≥n; 22 November 1868 ‚Äì 26 December 1948) was a Puerto Rican educator, women's rights advocate and suffragist. Born into an intellectual, liberal family, Benet trained as a teacher. Inhabitants of the island gained U.S. citizenship in 1917, after the United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain. Benet was active in the struggle for women's enfranchisement and joined the first suffragist organization that year. When U.S. women gained the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1919, Benet led the push to extend its coverage to Puerto Rico. In 1924, she filed a lawsuit challenging the right of the electoral board to refuse to register women as they were U.S. citizens. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled that states and territories have the right to determine who can vote and denied her claim. Benet continued pressing through the for the filing of various bills, which continued to be rejected by the insular legislature. In 1928, she pushed for the U.S. Congress to resolve the discrepancies in voting rights for women in Puerto Rico. Faced with the possibility that the federal legislature might give women the right to vote, the Puerto Rican legislature finally passed a law in 1929 granting suffrage to literate women. Universal suffrage, eliminating the educational restrictions, was gained in 1936. Benet is remembered for her work in education and for expanding women's rights in Puerto Rico. Early life Milagros Benet Col√≥n was born on 22 November 1868 in Cayey in the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico of the Spanish Empire to Ulpiana Col√≥n Collazo and Felix L. Benet Rivera. Her family was influential; both her father, who served as Secretary of the Provincial Council, and her brother Jos√©, who served in the House of Representatives, were politicians. Upon her father's death in 1898, Benet, her mother, and her younger sister Cruz went to live with her oldest sister Ulpiana de Gordils in the barrio Santurce in San Juan. It was also in 1898 that the United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain at the conclusion of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In 1901, both Benet and her younger sister Cruz earned their teaching certificates. Her sister became a nun but Benet went on to teach in the schools in Ponce, Puerto Rico. In 1911, she married Herbert Edwin Mewton (1873‚Äì1927) who was from England. Activism In 1917, Puerto Ricans gained U.S. citizenship and universal male suffrage. That year, the Puerto Rican Feminist League () was founded by Ana Roqu√©. The Feminist League was active in trying to gain the right for women to vote. In 1919, when their local senator, Antonio Rafael Barcel√≥, refused to discuss the matter, Benet, Isabel Andreu de Aguilar and Mar√≠a L. de Ashford traveled to Washington, D.C. to plead their case. Upon passage of the 19th Amendment, which granted the right to vote to U.S. women, the Bureau of Insular Affairs clarified to Governor Arthur Yager that its passage or ratification would not grant suffrage in Puerto Rico, because of the island's unincorporated status. In 1921, the Feminist League changed its name to the Suffragist Social League (), broadening its narrow focus on women's suffrage to demands for full civic and political participation for women. Benet served as the inaugural president of . That year, and subsequently in 1923, they submitted unsuccessful bills for women's enfranchisement to the insular legislature. Benet in 1922 In 1922, Benet, along with one of the first women lawyers in Puerto Rico, Ana Teresa Paradas, attended the Pan-American Conference of Women, in Baltimore, Maryland which led to the formation of a permanent Pan-American Women's Association. While there, she spoke on working conditions for women in her homeland. In 1923, Benet became president of the Puerto Rican branch of the Pan-American Women's Association. Both she and Mariana Morales Bernard, a leader in the women's labor movement, filed court cases to assess the applicability of the 19th Amendment to Puerto Rico, as had been suggested by Jos√© Tous Soto, after the 1923 bill had been rejected in the Senate. Benet also sued the electoral registration board for refusing to allow her to register. Her case argued that as a U.S. citizen, she should be allowed to vote in accordance with the U.S. Constitution, because territorial law was not allowed to contravene U.S. law. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico ruled that the electoral law was not discriminatory because Puerto Ricans were not allowed to vote for federal electors, and that the territory, like U.S. states, retained the right to define who was eligible to vote. Both cases were unsuccessful and they caused a rift in along political and social lines. Fearing that an alliance with working-class women would promote the spread of socialism, under the leadership of president Rosario Bellber the conservative faction of resigned from the organization. These women formed a new organization, the Puerto Rican Association of Women's Suffrage (), to work on suffrage exclusively for literate women. The liberal faction, many of whom were members of the Pure Republican Party (), were led by Benet. New elections for were held among the remaining members who supported developing universal suffrage and maintaining the links of republicans and socialists. Marta Robert, a vice president of the Territorial Central Committee and a Republican, was elected president while Olivia Paoli de Braschi, a member of the Socialist Party (), was elected vice president. Among the other members who remained, besides Benet, were Mar√≠a Luisa Arcelay, √Ångela Caldas de Mir√≥, Carmen G√≥mez de Grosas, Ricarda L√≥pez de Ramos Casellas, and Irene Fluxia de Thordsen. Despite the coalition with socialists, Benet was cautious about the association. When delivering questionnaires for the Pan-American Women's Association to gather statistical information on Puerto Rican women, she was careful to drop off the forms and leave the Free Federation of Labor offices quickly so as not to attract the attention of those who might see her as an advocate of socialism. She also refused to meet with suffragists in 1928 in the shantytown of La Perla, preferring a more \\"suitable location\\" elsewhere in San Juan. In 1927, a lobbying campaign by pressed for a suffrage bill's passage in the insular legislature. The bill passed the Senate, but failed in the House. Benet responded by pressing for suffrage in Puerto Rico to be reviewed by the U.S. Congress in 1928. She was surprised to find that some U.S. women were opposed to the federal congress granting Puerto Rican women the vote. An amendment to the Jones‚ÄìShafroth Act proposed in the U. S. Senate did not make it out of the Senate committee and never reached a vote in the U.S. House. A similar bill, H.R. 7010, was introduced in the U.S. House and passed the House in December 1928. Though continued to press for universal suffrage, they acknowledged that they would support giving the franchise to literate women alone, as a stepping stone for full voting rights. When it became apparent that the U.S. Congress was prepared to grant women's suffrage, the insular legislature approved a bill for literate women to vote on 16 April 1929. was the only suffragist organization that protested the measure and vowed to continue the fight until universal suffrage was granted; however, few further actions were taken by members of until it disbanded in the 1940s. Benet resigned her presidency in the Pan-American Women's Association in 1933, but continued activism on behalf of women and education. The following year, she was one of the intellectuals invited to assist in organizing the Puerto Rican Academy of History. Universal suffrage was finally gained in Puerto Rico in 1936, when a bill submitted by the Socialist Party the previous year, gained approval in the insular legislature. In 1938, she served as a delegate of the San Juan Teachers Union ( to an American Federation of Labor conference for teachers held in Cedar Point, Ohio. She attended the Pan American Conference in New York City in 1919 and was an honored guest of the Alliance of Pan American Round Tables conference in San Antonio, Texas. Death and legacy Benet died on 26 December 1948 in the Hospital Pavia, San Juan, Puerto Rico. In her lifetime, she was honored by many women's groups from North and South America. She is remembered today for her activism in the fight for women's suffrage in Puerto Rico and an analysis of her life points to the impact she had upon gaining the right to vote. While working women like Luisa Capetillo, Juana Col√≥n, and Genara Pag√°n de Arce fought for political rights, their struggle was focused around workers rights. They had little impact on the legal discussion of citizenship and as their organizational efforts focused on unionization and socialism, they were ineffective in organizing for broader appeal. When Benet, a member of the elite, filed her suit against the electoral board, she had the support of the liberal intellectual community, as well as a network of influential men who saw voting as an extension of democracy. The voting rights case she filed is still cited as a precedent for voting laws in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

His father was a weaver and catechist. He was educated at Reay parish school (a church school) then studied Divinity and Mathematics at King's College, Aberdeen. He is said to have been the best mathematician in Scotland. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery Church of Scotland in Caithness in 1805. He began working as an assistant minister at Kingussie then did mission work at Berriedale. In January 1807 he went to the Gaelic Chapel on Castle Wynd in Edinburgh to replace Rev McLachlan. During his time in Edinburgh he lived at Ramsay Gardens close to the chapel.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1810 In July 1813, at the wishes of Duncan Forbes of Culloden, he was translated to Urquhart. In 1818 he was discussed by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland regarding his apparent unwanted preaching in the neighbouring parishes of Aberlour and Strathbogie. This case attracted much public interest. In 1822 he made a mission voyage to the island of St Kilda, seeking to address its absence of church and minister. He spent two weeks on the island together with his friend Mr McLellan. He made a very detailed account of the inhabitants and the island. He made three further visits to the island, 1825, 1827 and 1830, making a detailed journal of each visit.The Apostle of the North: The Life and Labours of Rev John Macdonald by Rev J Kennedy In 1842 the University of New York awarded him an honorary doctorate.

Hewahewa was a powerful figure in the royal court of Hawaii and played a major role in the abolition of the kapu system, the decline of the native religion of Hawaii, and the introduction of Christianity to the Hawaiian Kingdom.  Biography  = Abolition of the kapu system = Hewahewa was born in the late 18th century. In 1819, French explorer Louis de Freycinet estimated Hewahewa was born around 1774. He grew up as part of the aristocracy of the pre-unified kingdom of the island of Hawai ªi and was a descendant of Pa ªao, a lineage that added to his prestige as a spiritual leader. Hewahewa's great- grandfather was Holo ªae, the kahuna of Alapa ªinui and Kalani ª≈çpu ªu, the latter of whom ruled during James Cook's fatal visit to the islands. Hewahewa's grandfather was Pailili (or Pailiki) and his father was Pu ªou, a kahuna of Kalani ª≈çpu ªu's successor Kamehameha I. A cousin of Hewahewa was Kek≈´haupi ªo, the instructor and military advisor of Kamehameha. 19th-century feather sculpture depiction of K≈´ka ªilimoku, the war god of Kamehameha I and Hewahewa's priestly line Hewahewa was educated as a kahuna and rose to prominence in the court of Kamehameha. Hewahewa and his family line were of the order of the war god K≈´ (mo ªo K≈´), which rose to prominence during the conflict that led up to the unification of the Hawaiian Islands and displaced the priestly order of the fertility god Lono. After Kamehameha united the Hawaiian islands into the Hawaiian Kingdom, he granted Hewahewa control over the Waimea Valley on Oahu, a powerful position within the kingdom. By the 1810s, Hewahewa was serving as kahuna-nui (high priest) and was responsible for maintaining the kapu code of conduct at the behest of King Kamehameha. In 1819, King Kamehameha died and his son Kamehameha II became the new monarch. Kamehameha II was not as strong a ruler as his father; his court advisers‚Äîincluding Hewahewa‚Äîbegan to exert influence over the kingdom. As kahuna-nui, Hewahewa was tasked with implementing and enforcing the kapu on the islands but by the time of Kamehameha II's ascension to the throne, Hewahewa had grown disillusioned with the system. His doubts were reinforced by the efforts of Ka ªahumanu, the late Kamehameha I's favorite wife, who had a relationship with high priest and persuaded him action was needed to break the kapu.D‚ÄôARCY, P. (2018). Creating a Kingdom: Hawai‚Äòi from 1796 to 1819. In Transforming Hawai‚Äòi: Balancing Coercion and Consent in Eighteenth-Century KƒÅnaka Maoli Statecraft (pp. 181-220). Acton ACT, Australia: ANU Press. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv301dpq.14 Acting on his views, Hewahewa and other court officials‚Äîincluding several female members of the royal family‚Äîplanned to abolish the kapu. The reformers' first target was a law that forbade women to eat certain foods and from eating with noblemen. At a grand feast held six months after Kamehameha I's death, his son was persuaded to eat alongside his female relatives; the women also ate forbidden foods at the feast, ushering the era of  ªAi Noa (free eating). While this display was criticized by more conservative members of Hawaiian society, it was also seen as breaking the monarchy's support of the kapu. Soon after the feast, Hewahewa embarked on a campaign to rid the kingdom of the kapu system. He was supported by a reformist faction within the kahunas and by two of Kamehameha I's queens, Ka ªahumanu‚Äîwho persuaded Hewahewa to support the adoption of  ªAi Noa)‚Äîand Ke≈çp≈´olani. Acting in his role as kahuna-nui, Hewahewa ordered the burning of religious idols, the destruction of heiaus, and the end of the kapu. Not all of the native Hawaiian religion was interfered with; family  ªaumƒÅkua remained untouched and the kahuna retained much of their political power as scholars and healers. Some Hawaiian leaders opposed Hewahewa's efforts to abolish the Hawaiian religion. A reactionary faction led by Keaoua Kekuaokalani, a nephew of Kamehameha I and former student of Hewahewa, revolted against Kamehameha II and his court. Despite gathering some support, the rebels were defeated at the Battle of Kuamo'o in December 1819, marking the end of organized resistance against Hewahewa and his supporters.Daws, Gavan (1968). Shoal of Time. pp. 54‚Äì56 = Introduction of Christianity = Letter written on July 27, 1830 from Hewahewa to Mikamalena (Levi Chamberlain) to affirm his ongoing faith in God In 1820, Christian missionaries arrived on the island. Many members of the Hawaiian nobility, including Hewahewa, eventually converted to Christianity; multiple sources note the introduction of Christianity filled the spiritual void left by the dissolution of the kapu system.Charlot, J. (2010). Two Early Hawaiian- Christian Chants. Anthropos, 105(1), 29-46. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/25734737 According to some sources, Hewahewa had predicted the arrival of a new god from the sea in the days before the first missionaries arrived in the islands. As the Christian faith spread throughout the Hawaiian islands, Hewahewa remained supportive of many of the new faith's systems of belief; rather than the traditional Hawaiian deities, he thanked Jehovah for food during a feast in place and composed a chant to worship the new god. Hewahewa remained supportive of free eating; he ate alongside women and later resigned his office as kahuna.Sissons, J. (2011). History as Sacrifice: The Polynesian Iconoclasm. Oceania, 81(3), 302-315. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/23209537 Hewahewa's dialogue with the missionaries also persuaded the powerful chiefess Kapi ªolani to adopt the Christian faith. Though the decline of the Hawaiian religion had decreased Hewahewa's influence as a spiritualist, he remained important in the Hawaiian Kingdom into the 1830s.Ralston, C. (1985). Early nineteenth century Polynesian millennial cults and the case of Hawai‚Äòi. The Journal of the Polynesian Society, 94(4), 307-331. Retrieved from www.jstor.org/stable/20705949 As an old man, he was called upon by Kamehameha III in an attempt to restore the native Hawaiian faith but Hewahewa persuaded the king to abandon the effort. Hewahewa was also known for exhibiting signs of alcoholism. According to reports in the contemporaneous Ke Kumu Hawaii and the Sandwich Island Gazette, Hewahewa died on February 16, 1837, at his home in Waimea, Oahu. He was ill for four months before his death and had asked his friends to pray for his salvation. There is, however, some discrepancy about his date of death; in 1893, Nathaniel Bright Emerson, who was born 1839, remembered Hewahewa \\"as a silent and wrinkled old man, who lived in a retired valley in Waialua, Island of Oahu, about the year 1848\\".  Legacy  Thousands of Hawaiians, including pioneering lifeguard Eddie Aikau, are descendants of Hewahewa In 2019, several acres of Hewahewa's lands in Waimea Valley, which were bestowed upon him by Kamehameha in the early 19th century, were granted protected status. In 2000, Hewahewa was posthumously inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame with a group of historical Hawaiian chanters.

It replaced the 1847 √•rs fattigv√•rdf√∂rordning and was in effect until the Poor Care Law of 1918. In 1847, the first Swedish social help system separate from the church had been organized by the 1847 √•rs fattigv√•rdf√∂rordning. It was adjusted only to a very minor degree by the 1853 √•rs fattigv√•rdf√∂rordning. The rapid changes during the mid 19th-century, including industrialisation, urbanization, labour movement and socialism, created an opposition toward public social projects among the ruling elite, who came to regard them as communism. The law from 1847, which was influenced by the liberalism of the 1840s, came to be regarded as too generous, and gradually the authorities came to practice it more and more strictly. This was illustrated during the Swedish famine of 1867‚Äì1869, when emergency relief was delivered almost exclusively to those willing to work for it. A growing opinion felt that society should take responsibility only for orphans, the aged, the insane and the mentally or physically challenged, and deny any form of assistance to all adults who were physically and mentally healthy. In 1871, the law of 1847 was reformed. While the organisation and the system introduced in 1847 was kept in form, the law of 1871 introduced more strict qualifications as to whom should be allowed to receive social benefits. By this reform, social benefits was banned for everyone except for those physically or mentally unable to work, such as orphans, the aged, the insane and the mentally or physically challenged, and further more banned the right to appeal a decision made by the Poor Care Board. The law of 1871 was thereby a severe deterioration of social help in Sweden, and those needing no longer qualified to apply for help from the state because of the new regulations was forced to rely on private charity (foremost the local Fruntimmers-skyddsf√∂rening) as well as old outdated customs such as roteg√•ng, the pauper auction and child auctions. It was not until the Poor Care Law of 1918 (1918 √•rs fattigv√•rdslag) that the entire poor relief system in Sweden was truly reformed and the roteg√•ng, the pauper auctions, the child auctions, the poor houses and other old fashioned phenomena were abolished.

The episode is presented as a single, continuous shot and was described by critics as among the year's best television episodes.  Plot  With no memory of the past four days, Elliot goes to work the day of the UN vote. He realizes he's been fired and that Stage 2 is going to happen today. He tries to evade security to shut it down, but is caught and escorted out. He tries calling in a bomb threat to get the target building evacuated, while a large gathering of anti E Corp protesters gathers at headquarters. Darlene appears, admitting she's working with the FBI and that Angela is working with Mr. Robot, helping Elliot remember his lost days. The protesters break into E Corp, terrifying the workers. Irving calls Angela, stating that the riot is a distraction so they can send Elliot to copy important data from an HSM in a secure room as a prerequisite to Stage 2. Angela hears that the UN agreed to the annexation, then is approached by a suspicious security guard. She attracts the protesters, who attack the security guard, so she can complete the assignment intended for Elliot, then passes the data to a Dark Army agent. Elliot confronts her in the chaos, asking if there's something she needs to tell him.  Production  The episode was shot to appear as a \\"one take\\": a single, continuous shot. Series creator and director Sam Esmail chose the style to convey the seamlessness of experience between characters Elliot and Angela. Since the set was split between Manhattan and Brooklyn, a single take proved impossible. Some shots included up to 15 cues and 27 takes. For the shots that floated between the Evil Corp skyscraper and the riots outside, cinematographer Tod Campbell and camera operator Aaron Medick used a Trinity stabilizing arm. The crew originally planned to let the hour progress in real time, swapping between individuals, but arrived at the one take for its heightened drama. Esmail stated that he was not interested in attempting the long take for showmanship purposes, but felt that the style was the best means for his desired tone. USA Network broadcast the show without commercial interruption.  Reception  Critics considered the episode among 2017's best. The New York Times described the episode as \\"exceptional\\", among the year's most unforgettable, and at the limits of television as an art form. Vox wrote that it \\"captured the freewheeling chaos that is being alive in 2017\\", that \\"everything is under control and nothing makes sense\\". Vox praised, in particular, the \\"dizzying, surreal\\", continuous shot that transferred between Angela in a high-security room and the protestors many floors below. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 93% based on 14 reviews with an average score of 9.12 out of 10; the website's critical consensus reads, \\"A searing look at corporate greed and banality, with dazzling editing, makes for one of the strongest episodes of the season.\\" Reviewers criticized Angela's portion of the episode as less coherent. The New York Times felt that Angela's performance was slow and that the sequence in which she searched for the USB drive was unsuited for real-time storytelling. In its initial broadcast on USA Network on November 8, 2017, the episode received 521,000 viewers.

He is considered an unavoidable figure in the history of Portuguese Geology, whose studies are still relevant to the knowledge of the geology of Portugal.FCT: Homenagem a Paul Choffat.  Biography  Born in Porrentruy, canton of Jura in French-speaking Switzerland, from a Soubey (Jura) family, he completed his primary and secondary studies in his homeland. After the high school, left for Besan√ßon, France, where he was employed in a bank house. During his stay in Besan√ßon he integrated with the local intelligentsia, establishing friendship with various naturalists and developing a great interest in geology. He was a member of the prestigious Soci√©t√© d'Emulation du Doubs. In 1871 he returned to Switzerland and the following year enrolled in the Chemistry and Natural Sciences course at the Federal Polytechnic School of Zurich and the University of Zurich. During his studies he became particularly interested in Paleontology, being a student, among others, of professors Arnold Escher von der Linth and Albert Heim.Hermann Lautensach, \\"Paul Choffat und die l√§nderkundliche Forschung in Portugal : ein Ged√§chtniswort\\". Geographica Helvetica, IV-2 (1949), pp. 97-105 (ver on-line). Having completed the course in 1876, the distinctive and brilliant manner in which the course was attended, as evidenced by the high standards of consideration it received from its teachers, led to that honorable appointment that same year as an aggregate professor of Animal Paleontology at the Federal Polytechnic School. from Zurich, where he had studied. He then began a research course in the field of paleontology, to which he devoted himself full-time, applying the early years of his career to the study of the Jurassic terrain of France and Switzerland, a subject in which he became an expert. During this period he met numerous geologists and paleontologists, contacts that he maintained throughout his scientific life. During the International Congress of Geology, held in Paris in 1878, he met Portuguese geologist Carlos Ribeiro (1813‚Äì1882), president of the Kingdom Geological Commission, who invited him to visit Portugal for the special purpose of studying the stratigraphy of Jurassic terrain. Given that at the time I suffered from pharyngitis Chronicle, who had been advised to cure in a dry, sunny climate, decided to accept the invitation, arriving in Lisbon in October 1878, proposing to stay in Portugal for three months, long enough to cure her illness. However, he would eventually stay in Portugal for about 40 years, until the end of his life, starting a research course on the geology of Portugal that would make him famous. Working for many years as an independent researcher, it was not until 1883 that he was officially hired as a geologist for the Geological Commission of the Kingdom (precursor of the Geological Services of Portugal).Evolu√ß√£o Institucional do Sector Geol√≥gico e Mineiro em Portugal. He initially devoted himself to the study of Mesozoic formations, but then broadened his field of interest, performing multiple works of applied geology, including research and characterization of mineral waters from the Mesozoic regions, and studies of western tectonics. of the Iberian Peninsula. He also devoted himself to the study of prehistoric lithic structures, a matter in which he was in many ways pioneer in Portugal. Also he devoted himself to geological mapping, one of the authors of the geological map of the country on the scale 1:500,000, published in 1899, which came to replace the one that had been published in 1876 by Carlos Ribeiro and Delgado. He played an important role in the elaboration of this letter, one of the best works of Portuguese geological cartography, collaborating intensely with Nery Delgado, the military engineer who at the time chaired the Geological Commission and headed the Geological Works Section. The cartographic studies he then carried out allowed him to publish a tectonic chart and a hypsometric chart of Portuguese territory. In the memory accompanying the hypsometric chart includes a set of studies on the physical geography of the Portuguese territory, still considered relevant today. In addition to the works of Portuguese theme, in the period prior to his coming to Portugal, he published several works concerning the paleontology and stratigraphy of the French and Swiss Jurassic lands, among which are worth mentioning the works that make up the work Esquisse du callovien et de The Oxfordien of the Middle Jura: Suivie of a Supplementary Aid to the Acanthicus Ammonites of the Occidental Jura, originally published in volumes III and IV of the Annals of the Geological Society of France.Bibliographic Metadata na Zentralbibliothek Z√ºrich.Texto integral da obra. Paul Choffat's hundreds of studies on Portuguese geology cover a wide range of themes, from the secondary formations of Portugal, to hydrogeology and tectonics, to various aspects of geotechnics (at the time viewed as applied geology). Among the various publications of his own, there are three general studies of great relevance to the knowledge of the geology of Portugal, one on the Jurassic and two on the Cretaceous: * Stratigraphic and palaeontological etude of jurassic terrains of Portugal - Le Lias and Dogger au Nord du Tage (1880); * Collection of Stratigraphic Monographs on the Cretacic Syndrome of Portugal - 1st. √©tude - Contres de Cintra, by Bellas et de Lisbonne (1885); * Replica of Monographies Stratigraphiques sur le cr√®me cr√®me - 2√©me. √©tude - The Cr√©tacique au Nord du Tage (1900). In those works established the stratigraphic classification of the Portuguese sedimentary formations, describing the respective faunas, lithological composition and facies. Another pioneering work is the essay entitled Essai sur la Tectonique de la Cha√Æne de l'Arrabida (1908), recently republished.Paul Choffat na Geologia portuguesa. Lisboa, Universidade Nova de Lisboa & Instituto Nacional de Engenharia, Tecnologia e Inova√ß√£o, 2008, . In the monographs he publishes about the Portuguese sedimentary formations he creates the Lusitanian, describes the Bathonian and Senonian floors and separates the Trias from the Infralias. In this context it is to relieve the creation of floor Lusitaniano for stratigraphic set Oxfordian upper and Kimmeridgian temporarily accepted and often still referred to. He also defined the floor he designated by Belasiano (meanwhile fallen into disuse), represented in the Belas region, outside Lisbon, consisting of marl andlimestones with a silicyblastic series at the base, corresponding to part of the Cenomanian.De rerum natura: L√©on Paul Choffat (1849-1919) por A.M. Galopim de Carvalho. The prestige he enjoyed inside and outside Portugal led to his being honored in the paleontological nomenclature, with Choffatella, a genus of foraminifera, and Choffatia, a genus of ammonites. Among others it is eponymous of the species Perisphinctes cf choffati, an ammonite, and Callavia choffati, a trilobite. In the field of geotechnics he elaborated a study for the drilling of the Rossio Tunnel, considered a pioneer work at the time, and was frequently consulted on works related to geology, giving advice on the best way to perform the works. He conducted surveys of the Abelheira and Pedra Furada ( Sabugo ) Cretaceous massifs, allowing groundwater flows to be found at 330 and 380 meters deep, and his work on the mineral waters of the Mesozoic regions is considered an exceptional hydrology work based on geology. One field to which he devoted particular attention was the publication of geological maps, collaborating with Nery Delgado in the geological survey of Portuguese territory that is the origin of the geological map published in 1899 and replaced the one that had been published in 1876 by Carlos Ribeiro and Nery Delgado. He also produced several regional maps, including the outskirts of Leiria, Arr√°bida, the Buarcos-Verride and Montejunto mountains. Although they were not published, he produced several geological maps in the 1:20 000 scale and when he passed away he was preparing a Description g√©ologique du Portugal, for which he had already collected a lot of data. Considered to be a ‚Äúhard-tempered\\" man \\"of a physique and temperament (‚Ä¶) audacious in his geological explorations (‚Ä¶) living only for his scientific studies,\\" despite having integrated himself in his homeland of adoption, becoming an individual of prestigious prestige. and one of the most outstanding services in science in Portugal, his relationship with his Portuguese colleagues was not one of the best, so he was considered a loner in his scientific work. Although he worked for 40 years in Portugal, he left no disciples, except the collectors of the Geological Commission and the military engineer and geologist Pereira de Sousa., with whom he later seems to have also become incompatible. His relationship with the geological service deteriorated after Nery Delgado's death in 1908, making him increasingly critical of the course the institution took. As a result, after Paul Choffat's death, the heirs withdrew their entire scientific estate, most of which only returned to Portugal in the 1940s, through the good offices of the Geological Society of Portugal. He was a member of numerous committees within the International Geology Congress, had honorable scientific titles, and was named for numerous paleontological genera and species. He received the most imminent scientific men of his time due consecration as noted geologist, most notably the remarkable biographical note published by the German geographer Hermann Lautensach upon Paul Choffat birth centenary. In translation by Jos√© Cust√≥dio de Morais, the note was republished in the \\"Memoirs and News\\" inserted in the Publications series of the Mineralogical and Geological Museum of the University of Coimbra (No. 25, 1949).Hermann Lautensach, \\"Paul Choffat e a Geografia de Portugal\\" (tradu√ß√£o de J.

The statue was exhibited at the Second and Third International Congresses of Eugenics in 1921 and 1932, respectively, as a visual representation of that which eugenicists considered to be the degeneration of the white race. While the statue received mixed responses from contemporary critics, it inspired the creation of additional composite statues as propaganda for the eugenics movement throughout the mid-twentieth century.  Conception  Created in 1921, the figure was based on anthropometric measurements taken from 100,000 white U.S. Army recruits. Body measurements of drafted and demobilized American soldiers were commissioned by the Office of the Surgeon General and documented by Charles Davenport and Albert G. Love. The data collected was then averaged by Davenport's daughter Jane in order to create the final composite statue. = Eugenic Ideals = Such anthropometric studies had been used by eugenicists since the late nineteenth century to analyze various criminal, professional, and racial types of people. They were often represented visually through composite photography, one example of which was Francis Galton‚Äôs composite portraiture. In the instance of the Average Young American Male, the use of sculpture as a medium allowed for three- dimensional examination of average body types. Although the data had been collected from World War I soldiers, wartime effects on the men's physique were not discussed. Instead, the depicted decline in the average American male's body was attributed solely to biological inheritance and immigration. Henry Fairfield Osborn, co-founder of the Galton Society, delivered a speech alongside the exhibition that included the \\"Average Young American Male\\" statue, in which he encouraged the men in the room to realize that they were \\"engaged in a serious struggle to maintain our historic republican institutions through barring the entrance of those who are unfit to share the duties and responsibilities of our well-founded government.\\"  Exhibition  The composite statue was exhibited both the Second and Third International Eugenics Congresses held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, for the primary purpose of explaining the need for eugenic measures to a general public. = Second International Eugenic Congress = The exhibition in 1921 included a poster titled What is Eugenics? followed by this definition: > ‚Äúthat science which studies the inborn qualities ‚Äì physical, mental, and > spiritual ‚Äì in man, with a view to their improvement. Nothing is more > evident in the history of families, communities, and nations that, in the > change of individuals from generation to generation, some families, some > races, and the people of some nations, improve greatly in physical > soundness, in intelligence and in character, industry, leadership, and other > qualities which make for human breed improvement; while other racial, > national, and family stocks die out ‚Äì they decline in physical stamina, in > intellectual capacity and in moral force\\" (Laughlin 1934, 13). In order to illustrate the above eugenic idea of racial degeneracy, the exhibit included a pair of composite statues. At one end of the hall stood \\"The Average Young American Male, 100,000 White Veterans, 1919\\" and at the other stood \\"the Composite Athlete, 30 Strongest Men of Harvard.\\" In her analytical essay \\"The American Adonis,\\" Mary Coffey wrote that the contrast between the healthy, idealized body of the composite Harvard athlete and the pudgy stomach and flaccid muscles of the average young American male provided a persuasive visual representation of the eugenic notion that the national white body was degenerating as a result of ill-advised race mixing with inferior European stocks. = Third International Eugenic Congress = The first time the sculpture was shown, its juxtaposition with the composite sculpture of a Harvard athlete highlighted the degeneration to the Nordic body type caused by race mixing with \\"less evolved\\" white racial strains. In 1932, however, at the Third International Eugenic Congress, eight years after the passage of the Immigration Restriction Act, the statue was a stand-alone exhibit. Its interpretation during this Congress had shifted to a sign of the degeneracy of the average American male resulting from differential birthrate. Coffey proposes that this shift in interpretation of the sculpture paralleled a shift in eugenicist focus from immigrants being primarily responsible for race degeneracy to white, middle-class, educated women who were having fewer children as being the main cause of national genetic decline.  Criticism  It was widely agreed that Davenport's sculpture revealed that the average white male's physical fitness was far from ideal. Journalists criticized his pudgy stomach, slouching posture, heavy hips, and undefined muscles and interpreted the statue as a symbol of American degeneracy. The concept of composite statuary was also criticized by reviewers who denounced Davenport's statue as bearing no resemblance to life and a piece that does not deserve artistic merit. Because it was created using statistics, many art critics argued that the statue was not a true portrait of the average American and denounced it as a purely imaginary figure. In 1932, writing for the New York Times, art critic Edward Alden Jewell asked rhetorically, ‚ÄúWhat is a work of art and what is a work of science?‚Äù His response to the sculpture included criticism of the growing authority of science to quantify and represent man over and against aesthetic canons of ideal beauty. Jewell referred to a conflict between the ‚ÄúMasterpiece‚Äù and the ‚ÄúModeled Chart.‚Äù He wrote that since the Average American Male statue was created on the basis of data, or ‚Äútwo-dimensional charts,‚Äù collected from 100,000 ‚Äúdoughboys,‚Äù he cannot be considered a work of art.  Legacy  Despite criticism in 1921 during its first exhibition, the sculpture remained on display through the Third International Congress of Eugenics and inspired the creation of additional composite statues by various artists over the next couple decades, meant to further the eugenic agenda and represent different racial types.

Background Minamoto no Yoshitsune was one of the most important samurai warriors to exist at the end of the Heian era in 12th century Japan. He led his warriors to victory over the Taira for his half brother Minamoto no Yoritomo in the Genpei wars, and helped to bring about the creation of Japan's first bakufu, or tent government in Kamakura, just south of the little known fishing village of Edo on the sea side. While fighting the Taira clan he had a few disagreements with the shogun's favourite advisor, Kajiwara Kagetoki which proved to be bad for his position when he would later want to meet with the brother he never had time to know as a child growing up. Kajiwara was able to convince Yoritomo that Yoshitsune would be a threat, and had to be eliminated, and so when Yoshitsune travelled from the capital which we now know as Kyoto with two high ranking Taira prisoners, Munemori and his son Kiyomune, he wasn't allowed to enter the city gates and was forced to wait in Koshigoe nearby. After nine days Yoshitsune wrote a final plea and pledge of allegiance to Yoritomo, and this letter was translated from the Gikeiki in 1966 by Helen Craig McCullough for her book Yoshitsune: A 15th Century Japanese Chronicle. The letter > To His Excellency the Governor of Inaba: (Oe no Hiromoto) I, Minamoto > Yoshitsune, venture to address you. Having overthrown the enemies of the > court and erased the infamy of military defeat as His Lordship's deputy and > the bearer of an imperial commission, I had supposed that my deeds would be > commended; yet, to my distress, pernicious slanders have caused > accomplishments of uncommon merit to be ignored. Though innocent, I am > blamed; though deserving, and guilty of no error, I have incurred His > Lordship's displeasure. What can I do but weep bitter tears! Since I have > not been permitted to refute false accusations, or even to enter Kamakura, I > have been obliged to remain idle for days, with no means of expressing my > feelings. I have been denied the privilege of seeing His Lordship for so > long that the blood bond between us seems to have vanished. Is this the > karma of a previous existence? Am I being punished for evil acts committed > in my last life? Alas! Unless the august spirit of my late father chances to > be reborn, who will plead my cause or pity my condition? At the risk of > appearing querulous, I must say to you that never since birth have I enjoyed > a moment's peace of mind - never, from the time of my journey in my mother's > arms to Uda District in Yamato, an infant orphaned by my father's death. > Though able to preserve my useless life, I could not safely frequent the > capital but was obliged to skulk in out-of-the-way places, dwell in distant > lands, and serve commoners. When at last, through sudden good fortune, I was > sent to the capital to crush the Taira clan, I first punished Kiso Yoshinaka > and then set about the destruction of the Heike. I whipped my mount over > precipitous cliffs, heedless of life in the face of the enemy; I braved the > perils of wind and wave on the boundless sea, ready to sink to the bottom as > food for monsters of the deep. Battle dress was my pillow; arms were my > profession - yet, as in the past, my sole desire was to comfort the unhappy > spirits of the dead.

Fifth day, sixth month, second > year of Genryaku [1185] Historicity There is much disagreement among Japanese scholars over whether this letter was ever written or not. It had become over the centuries part of the World of Yoshitsune (Yoshitsune no Sekai) that included books, oral story telling, Noh and Kabuki plays as well as movies and TV dramas. It has been argued by some that the language used in the text of the letter isn't consistent with the education of an orphaned bushi youngster who had studied with the monks at Kurama temple, but was more likely the product of court educated storytellers who needed to add a little sympathy and drama to the mythology.

Last survivor of the Hindenburg disaster Doehner, the last living link to the Hindenburg disaster's part of American history, lived his life in relative low profile obscurity. He eventually became historically significant when he was acknowledged as being the last living survivor of the original surviving 62 passengers and crew who jumped from the dirigible's flames on May 6, 1937, at NAS Lakehurst, Lakehurst Borough, New Jersey. The Hindenburg flames and crash killed Doehner's father, sister, and 34 others. Doehner, his parents, older brother and sister were taking a vacation on the Hindenburg from Germany to New Jersey. Doehner finally ended his self-imposed silence in 2017, and told the Associated Press on the 80th anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster that his mother threw him and his older brother out of the ship while it was on fire. His mother then jumped from the flaming Hindenburg to the ground after them. Hydrogen, exposed to air, had triggered an inferno somewhere on the airship, causing flames to flicker atop the airship, which then ignited the airship as it attempted but failed to land.

Published in 1878, it was the first compilation of oral works designed for the Albanian public. History The first to collect Albanian folk material were European scholars of the mid 19th century, followed particularly by philologists and linguists concerned with recording a little known Indo- European language. The Albanian National Awakening, aimed at protecting and promoting the interests of the Albanian people, gave rise to native collections of Albanian folklore. By highlighting the long traditions, national affirmation was sought. Thimi Mitko, a member of the Albanian community in Egypt, first showed interest in Albanian folklore in 1859. According to Spiro Dine, by 1966 Mitko was providing Demetrio Camarda with material for his collection. Mitko also had contacts with the European poets Gustav Mayer, Urban Jarnik and Girolamo de Rada. In 1874, he finished his own collection of 505 folk songs, and 39 tales and old sayings. The work, focused mostly on material from southern Albania, was written in Greek script. According to Mitko, the intention was to provide Egypt's Albanian community with information about Albanian origins, customs and character. His view was that the heroic songs collected by him showed that Albanians, by keeping the memory of history through songs, had a love of country and their fellow countrymen, regardless of religion. Mitko preserved the wealth of Albanian folk literature by classifying the content based on genre. In 1978 it was published in Alexandria under the Greek title Albanike melissa, with the Albanian B√´lietta shqip√´tare placed as subtitle. Mitko also prepared an additional collection of folk literature, the Little Bee that never got published. A copy of Albanian Bee is said to have been publicly burned by Greek nationalists in Athens. By the time the work was published, the Western European Romantic Movement was in decline, and interest in folkore was waning. Albanian Bee gained new popularity after it was published in the modern Albanian alphabet by Gjergj Pekmezi in 1934.

He was also disfavoured by Pratap Singh's son Rana Bahadur Shah. Life =Favourism to Bahadur Shah= King Prithvi Narayan Shah had appointed Pandit Gajraj Mishra as an attendant and permanent resident in Banaras to watch over the activities of the neighbouring countries. On January 1775, King Prithvi Narayan Shah died at Nuwakot. In order to prevent Prince Bahadur Shah from being a Chautariya(royal chief minister), Swarup Singh Karki marched with army to Nuwakot to confine Prince Bahadur who was then mourning the death of his father former King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Bahadur Shah was confined on the orders of newly crowned King Pratap Singh Shah. Guru Gajraj Mishra was a teacher of both King Pratap Singh and Prince Bahadur. On his visit to offer blessings to his disciple and newly crowned King Pratap Singh, he was disappointed with the confinement of his other disciple Prince Bahadur Shah. He requested to the King that instead of confinement, Prince Bahadur should be given a fresh life at exile. On 1778 AD, Queen Rajendra Laxmi succeeded in the confinement of Prince Bahadur Shah with the help of her new minister Sarbajit Rana Magar. Guru Gajraj Mishra again came to rescue Bahadur Shah on the condition that Bahadur Shah should leave the country. =Treaty of Commerce and Alliance= During the tenure of Mulkaji Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, on 28 October 1801, a Treaty of Commerce and Alliance was finally signed between Nepal and East India Company.

King Rana Bahadur wrote letters to his brothers Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah and Chautariya Bidur Shahi from Banaras during his exile where he blatantly blamed that Gajraj Mishra and Damodar Pande planned to dethrone Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah and make Chautariya Krishna Shah as the King of Nepal after the signing of the Treaty of Commerce and Alliance with British.

The conjecture, which is named after French mathematicians √âlie Cartan and Jacques Hadamard, may be traced back to work of Andr√© Weil in 1926. Informally, the conjecture states that negative curvature allows regions with a given perimeter to hold more volume. This phenomenon manifests itself in nature through corrugations on coral reefs, or ripples on a petunia flower, which form some of the simplest examples of non-positively curved spaces.  History  The conjecture, in all dimensions, was first stated explicitly in 1976 by Thierry Aubin, and a few years later by Misha Gromov, Yuri Burago and Viktor Zalgaller. In dimension 2 this fact had already been established in 1926 by Andr√© Weil and rediscovered in 1933 by Beckenbach and Rado. In dimensions 3 and 4 the conjecture was proved by Bruce Kleiner in 1992, and Chris Croke in 1984 respectively. According to Marcel Berger, Weil, who was a student of Hadamard at the time, was prompted to work on this problem due to \\"a question asked during or after a Hadamard seminar at the Coll√®ge de France \\" by the probability theorist Paul L√©vy. Weil's proof relies on conformal maps and harmonic analysis, Croke's proof is based on an inequality of Santal√≥ in integral geometry, while Kleiner adopts a variational approach which reduces the problem to an estimate for total curvature.  Generalized form  The conjecture has a more general form, sometimes called the \\"generalized Cartan‚ÄìHadamard conjecture\\" which states that if the curvature of the ambient Cartan‚ÄìHadamard manifold M is bounded above by a nonpositive constant k, then the least perimeter enclosures in M, for any given volume, cannot have smaller perimeter than a sphere enclosing the same volume in the model space of constant curvature k. The generalized conjecture has been established only in dimension 2 by Gerrit Bol, and dimension 3 by Kleiner. The generalized conjecture also holds for regions of small volume in all dimensions, as proved by Frank Morgan and David Johnson. Applications Immediate applications of the conjecture include extensions of the Sobolev inequality and Rayleigh‚ÄìFaber‚ÄìKrahn inequality to spaces of nonpositive curvature.

Background Arthur Stein's father Charles came from the shtetl of Mazritch (Miƒôdzyrzec Podlaski?) in Poland. He studied at the Evander Childs High School in The Bronx. Career Stein joined the Communist Party some time in the late 1920s or early 1930s, and co-organized the 1932 Chicago Counter-Olympics (also known as the International Workers Athletic Meet, the first Olympic counter-protest). He later was an employee at the Works Progress Administration and then the War Production Board. Arthur Stein had helped co- found the United Federal Workers of America or UFWA (one of the two predecessor unions of the United Public Workers of America or UPWA), was elected president of its Works Progress Administration local, and later worked as a full-time organizer for the UPWA. In 1937, he helped organize a secret cell of the Party within a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and later at the National Labor Relations Board. On February 23, 1943, Stein testified before a subcommittee of the House Committee on the Civil Service as assistant to secretary-treasurer, United Federal Workers of America, Congress of Industrial Organizations (now part of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform) regarding additional compensation for civilian employees. In January-February 1944, Stein testified before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor (now United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) regarding salaries of government employees. In December 1944, a House Miscellaneous report listed names and union affiliations of \\"110 leaders of the work in which the C.I.O Political Action Committee\\" engaged with the National Federal for Constitutional Liberties. It listed Stein as \\"assistant to secretary-treasurer, United Federal Workers of America.\\" Espionage In December 1955, Herbert Fuchs testified under subpoena before House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and described Arthur Stein as a recurring leader in underground networks in the federal government. In 1936, when Fuchs moved to Washington, DC, and joined the Wheeler Committee. Arthur Stein led the committee's communist members. They included: James Gorham, Samuel Koenigsberg, Ellis Olim, and Margaret Bennett Porter (wife of John W. Porter). When Fuchs moved to the National Labor Relations Board, his comrades were: again Arthur Stein, Allan Rosenberg, Martin Kurasch, Joseph Robison, Eleanor Nelson, Henry Rhine, Philip Reno, Sidney Katz, Julia Katz, and Bernard Stern. Fuchs named Victor Perlo as Party dues collector at the NLRB; Arthur Stein succeeded him. Personal life and death On August 12, 1933, Stein married Annie Steckler. Their daughter Eleanor Raskin joined the Students for a Democratic Society and become a leader in the Weather Underground domestic terrorist group. (Eleanor would marry fellow Weatherman Jeff Jones in 1981; their son Thai Jones is a nationally known journalist.)

It is the highest point of the Fitzsimmons Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges, and can be readily seen from the Whistler Blackcomb ski area. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Macbeth, to the north-northeast. The Benvolio Glacier rests below the south aspect of the summit, the Fitzsimmons Glacier on the east aspect, and the expansive Overlord Glacier spans the northern and western aspects of the mountain. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from its glaciers drains into tributaries of the Cheakamus River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1923 by Phyllis Munday and Don Munday via the Benvolio Glacier. The mountain's descriptive name was recommended by the Garibaldi Park Board and officially adopted on September 2, 1930, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Overlord Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Overlord Mountain.

The music for the film was composed by Govind Vasantha. Thambi was released on 20 December 2019, receiving praise for the performances, action sequences and writing. Plot The film starts with a fight between two teenagers Saravanan and Manimaran where Saravanan is hit on the head by Manimaran and faints. Manimaran is forced to run away leaving the fainted Saravanan on top of a lorry. The scene then shifts to 15 years later at the house of Gnanamoorthy (Sathyaraj), a politician in the Mettupalayam district, who lives with his wife Padma (Seetha), daughter Parvathy (Jyothika), and his mother (Sowcar Janaki). Parvathy spends her days in sorrow, hoping that her aggressive younger brother Saravanan (Navneeth Madhav) who had left the home 15 years ago, would return home. Her family too believes that the miracle may happen one day. One day, Moorthy receives a call from Jeevanand (Ilavarasu), who tells him that his long-lost son is found. Moorthy finds out that his \\"son\\" is Vicky (Karthi), a trickster and tourist guide in Goa. Moorthy takes Saravanan back to his house, where Padma is elated at seeing her son. However, Parvathy does not show any affection and keeps shunning Vicky. Saravanan's childhood friend and lover Sanjana (Nikhila Vimal) is also elated to reunite with 'Saravanan'. Later, it is revealed that Jeeva and Vicky had put a plan that Vicky would act as Saravanan for a while and would steal some money and escape. Jeeva and Vicky would then share the bounty. Saravanan's friend Karan (Anson Paul), who is a police officer, doubts whether Vicky is actually Saravanan, and feels his doubts are confirmed when he asks Vicky about their childhood and he blabbers. But Parvathy shuns Karan from trying to disprove Vicky/Saravanan because anyway the joy in family has come back upon his arrival. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Moorthy is actually the one who had made Jeeva make Vicky act as Saravanan. When Jeeva blackmails Moorthy for two crores, Moorthy kills Jeeva and puts the blame on Manimaaran (Bala), who was Saravanan's friend who hit him in the head at the beginning of the movie, and is now a local politician who wants to build a resort in the nearby village. Karan doubts Vicky in his involvement in the murder since he shows up at Jeeva's house to remove the evidence that he is a fraud. Karan doesn't find any evidence tying Moorthy or Vicky to the murder and arrests Manimaaran. It is revealed to the audience that Moorthy had entered the house once again and removed all the evidence. While Vicky is driving around in a car, he is hit by a lorry and narrowly escapes death. Another attack in the house confirms his suspicions that someone is trying to kill Saravanan and sets out to find what really happened to Saravanan. After tracing Saravanan's steps that night, he finds the lorry that hit him and on interrogating the driver, it is revealed that the perpetrator is Moorthy's right-hand man Sudhakar (Hareesh Peradi), who was angry that Saravanan had come back and he would lose the position of MLA to Saravanan. Finally, from a clue by Saravanan's girlfriend Sanjana (Nikhila Vimal), Vicky deduces that Saravanan had come back (he had fought with his mother and sister and was the reason for Moorthy's mother's condition) and in the anger that Saravanan was the cause of his mother's paralysis, Moorthy had killed him accidentally and used the sympathy to earn votes. On confronting him, Moorthy offers Vicky money to keep the matter quiet, but Vicky tells Padma, who is also aware of the truth. Finally, Parvathy holds Vicky at gunpoint and reveals the truth. After Saravanan had fought with his mother and sister and pushed his grandmother down the stairs, Padma and Parvathy take Moorthy's mother to the hospital. Meanwhile Saravanan who was hit on the head in a fight with his friend Manimaran, manages to escape and returns home in his bike. Moorthy and Parvathy comes back to the house and sees Saravanan in a drugged state. In a fit of rage, he keeps beating Saravanan, but when Saravanan hits him back in a drug-fueled rage, Moorthy breaks down. Parvathy tries to console her father and finds that Saravanan was doing drugs. She throws the drugs away, and Saravanan tries to choke her. In desperation, Parvathy grabs the nearest weapon and accidentally slits his throat, and Saravanan dies. In order to save his family's reputation, Moorthy fabricates a story where Saravanan had run away. Saravanan's body was interred in the forest area where the resort is now proposed to be built. Shocked at the revelation, Vicky decides to leave the house, and at the train station, Parvathy says that she had really accepted Vicky as her brother. The film ends with Vicky/Saravanan and Parvathy driving back to their home.

He is notable for his public criticism of efforts by the Japanese government to regulate religious bodies and strengthen a national form of Shinto, which culminated in a government-backed attack that left Osaka close to death. During his recovery, a personal awakening transformed his conceptualization of Christianity from an earthly, altruistic social practice to an ascetic practice rooted in Catholic orthodoxy. Osaka was a student and lifelong friend of philosopher Kitaro Nishida, the founder of the Kyoto School.  Early Life and Education  Osaka was born on June 25, 1880, in Daijoji-cho, Enuma-gun, Ishikawa Prefecture, to Kamayoshi Hiratsuka and his wife Koshiki Momoshi. He was later adopted by the Osaka family. In 1901, Osaka accompanied his teacher at Ishikawa Prefectural Hirojo Junior High School, Zen philosopher Kitaro Nishida, to a Zen sesshin at a temple in Mikawa. Nishida inspired Osaka began his studies in the Department of Political Science at Tokyo Imperial University in 1903. He was baptized at the Ichi Bancho Church in Tokyo in 1904 by pastor and theologian Masahisa Uemura and briefly enrolled at Uemura's Tokyo Theological Seminary. Osaka left Tokyo Imperial University in 1908 over personality conflicts with Uemura to attend Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City. He graduated from Auburn in 1911 and moved to Edinburgh to attend the New College. He returned to Japan in 1912 on a \\"foreign mission.\\"Auburn Theological Seminary (New York, N.Y.)

Ministry and Turn Toward Progressive Christianity  After his return, Osaka became affiliated with the Japanese Christian Church as a minister in 1913. He was subsequently ordained pastor of the Takanawa Church. Osaka became critical of what he perceived as indifference by the church toward contemporary social problems. When the Japanese Christian Church fractured in 1917, he left to establish an independent church near Osaki Station in Tokyo. To disseminate his progressive views, he began to publish a magazine entitled The Friend of Faith in the same year. Articles in English and Japanese were both featured in the magazine. The Osaki church began to operate in 1919. In 1922, he established a study group called the Messianic Society of the People's Church Study Group to further develop and teach his ideas.  Yomiuri Newspaper Column and Attack  Osaka accepted an invitation to contribute to the Religion Column of the Yomiuri Newspaper from his high school friend, media mogul Matsutar≈ç Sh≈çriki in 1925. Beginning in 1929, Osaka used his column to criticize the Japanese State's development of policies that sought to centralize control of domestic religious organizations and promote a form of Shinto that scholars have dubbed State Shinto. To strengthen opposition to the Religious Bodies laws of 1927 and 1929, as well as the \\"Shrine Issue\\" that sought mandatory participation of Japanese school children in religious ceremonies at imperial shrines, he promoted solidarity between Japanese Christians and Buddhists on the issue. Inter-religious dialogue was considered a prerequisite for establishing a more democratic Japan by many Japanese Christians at the time. At the behest of philosopher Miki Kiyoshi, another student of Kitaro Nishida, Osaka organized discussions with several intellectuals and philosophers related to the Kyoto School, including Nishida himself. The sessions took place in June and July 1932, and they resulted in texts published in the Yomiuri Newspaper to great public acclaim. In May 1933, Osaka interviewed his former teacher Nishida to discuss Nazi-sponsored book burnings in Germany. Nishida argued that the \\"genuine cultural achievements of Germans,\\" which included contributions to \\"music, theater, and philosophy,\\" could not be destroyed by Nazi cultural politics. Nishida told Osaka that he thought it ironic that both capitalism and communism, the two forces of ideology he considered to be most influential in the epoch, had been birthed by Jewish thinkers David Ricardo and Karl Marx respectively. The interview exemplified Osaka's willingness to publish text critical of the tenets of Japanese ultranationalism. As Osaka became increasingly vocal in his criticism, the newspaper's conservative management believed that publishing his ideas would \\"cultivate a feeling of suspicion and animosity toward the politically idealistic and naive\\" young pastor. In February 1934, Osaka criticized the Shrine System Investigative Committee (Jinja Seido Chosakai), which the Diet had created as an advisory council on the \\"Shrine Issue,\\" calling it vacuous and challenging what he perceived as its unjust legal protection. In response to the criticism, leader of the committee Imaizumi Teisuke and his subordinates brought Osaka to the Tokyo Daijingu in the Iidabashi District. Imaizumi's men, who were hired gangsters, forced Osaka to his knees and demanded that he atone for his criticism. When he rejected their demands, they forced him to bow his head while beating him with their fists. Osaka was then taken to the Meiji Shrine in Shibuya, where Imaizumi's men gave him a severe beating.  Recovery  Osaka described his recovery after the attack as \\"receiving one life for nine deaths.\\" He was hospitalized for nine months and confined to bed for three years. Pleurisy caused by trauma to the ribs led to degeneration of the ribs themselves, which required numerous surgeries and medical care for almost two years after the attack. Ultimately, four of Osaka's ribs were removed. Matsutar≈ç Sh≈çriki paid for Osaka's hospital bills. While he recovered, Osaka began a correspondence with his old friend philosopher Nishida Kitaro, who had come to visit him in the hospital.  Transformation and Ascetic Lifestyle  According to scholar Thomas Hastings, Osaka came to understand his earlier engagement with Christianity as \\"excessively conceptual and philosophical.\\" He had spent very little time searching for meaning in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, as his engagement had been with a Christianity that he understood as an Earthly \\"philosophical or social movement.\\" He came to see his ordeal as a trial. Osaka concluded that up until the attack, he had lived life \\"to the detriment of himself and others.\\" His reflection during his recovery prompted him to devote himself entirely to disseminating \\"the truth of Christianity\\" and pursuing \\"an embodied, holistic piety.\\" After his discharge from the hospital, Osaka attended the Osaki Church. He devoted his time to \\"reading, prayer, and religious practice\\" in addition to preaching. According to a member of the church, Osaka switched from reading Kierkagaard to Augustine when he found the former lacking in what he sought. In Augustine's work, he saw parallels to his own life experiences that became so intense that his hands shook while he read. His reading of Augustine led him to seek out works of other early theologians, including the Ante Nicean and Post Nicean Fathers in Tokyo's bookstores. Osaka came to believe it essential that he \\"exemplify\\" a devout life in order to \\"encourage others.\\" He constructed a small bedchamber for himself connected to the church sanctuary, rising early every morning to spend the day praying and studying. He remained at the church all hours of the day and offered three prayer meetings with members of the church in the morning, afternoon, and evening. He also offered lectures. Osaka lived this ascetic lifestyle until the turmoil of the Second World War prevented Osaka from continuing.  Notoriety Outside of Japan  In 1939, an anonymous author writing in The Christian Century incorporated the story of Osaka's attack into a critical essay that attacked the silence they perceived among Western Christians around the marginalization of Japanese Christians by the state. He wrote: > \\"Now came the time when Japanese Christians had to choose between Caesar and > God. There was on remarkable Christian minister in Tokyo who chose God. > Before him I am ashamed, because I am a coward. Before him the much exalted > Kagawa might be ashamed, because it seems that he too is afraid of the > Ceasar of Japan. This minister kept on writing and preaching that God was > his choice, that God must be recognized by the Japanese nation, that God is > still the king of kings, and that Japan shall perish if she does not obey > God. In his church and in public places, this man proclaimed all these > dangerous things. The Yomiuri Daily News of Tokyo carried some of his > messages in its church section. One day a group of terrorists broke into his > study. They beat him until he was unconscious. They forced him to go through > a pilgrimage to the shrines of the living and dead deities of the nation as > a penitent.

But not a single man followed in Osaka's steps or > openly approved his path.

Life He was born at Fern, Forfarshire, the son of George Tytler (d. 1785), minister of there, and his wife, Janet Robertson; he was the younger brother of James Tytler. He was one of the early members of the Physical Society of Edinburgh. First practising as a physician in Brechin, Tytler then went to abroad. He went around 1797 to Guernsey with his family; they then moved to the Cape of Good Hope, where Tytler had the post of Apothecary to the Forces, returning to the United Kingdom in 1802 when it became again part of the Dutch Cape Colony. After some months in London, they settled in Edinburgh. (Marshall states that Tytler went to India.) Tytler wrote for the Gentleman's Magazine and other periodicals. The Scots Magazine in 1803 published a letter of his to the poet Eaglesfield Smith, critical of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey. Tytler died at Edinburgh on 22 July 1808. Works Tytler published: *Works of Callimachus translated into English Verse; the Hymns and Epigrams from the Greek, with the Coma Berenices from the Latin of Catullus (1793), reputedly the first translation of a Greek poet by a native of Scotland.

This adaptation of the character maintains the origin of his parents being murdered in an alleyway behind a movie theater, however this adaptation does not feature the killer as Joe Chill, but rather Jack Napier, who would go on to become Batman's arch- nemesis, the Joker. Production =Casting= Multiple actors were considered for the role of Batman during production. In Tom Mankiewicz's original script which Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman was attached to, actor Bill Murray was considered for the role in a script that featured Eddie Murphy as Dick Grayson / Robin. Gremlins director Joe Dante was attached to the project as well at one point. The script was intended as a comedy, but was altered significantly after Tim Burton's involvement. Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Tom Selleck, Harrison Ford, Pierce Brosnan, Willem Dafoe, Alec Baldwin, Patrick Swayze, Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Quaid and Jean- Claude Van Damme were all considered for the role. Eventually, producer Jon Peters suggested Michael Keaton, claiming he had the right \\"edgy, tormented quality\\" for the role, and based his argument off Keaton's dramatic performance in the film Clean and Sober. At the time, Keaton was primarily known for comedic parts in Mr. Mom and Beetlejuice, the latter also being directed by Burton.John Peters, The Death of \\"Superman Lives\\": What Happened?, 2015 Keaton's casting as the character caused an uproar from fans of the character, who claimed Keaton was too comedic and too short for the role. Over 50,000 recorded protest letters were sent to Warner Bros. offices, and the casting was questioned by screenwriter Sam Hamm, producer Michael Uslan and even Batman co-creator Bob Kane. =Batsuits= The design of the Batsuit worn by Keaton was designed by costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood turned down the opportunity to work on James Bond film Licence to Kill to work on Batman. Ringwood stated that designing the Batsuit was difficult, claiming \\"the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build. The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.\\" Producer Jon Peters had requested for the Batsuit to feature a Nike product-placement, but was shot down by Burton and Ringwood, feeling that it would not be intimidating.Bob Ringwood, Tim Burton, Designing the Batsuit, 2005, Warner Home Video 28 latex designs of the suit were made, as well as 25 different capes and 6 different heads. It was decided the use of spandex as in the comics and previous adaptations would not be intimidating enough, so the character was given black armor pieces. The Batsuit was upgraded for Batman Returns, using a more flexible foam latex, as well as a more traditional chest emblem. The updated Batsuit also featured a zipper to allow for urination in between takes and an updated plated armor torso that did not resemble sculpted muscles.Bob Ringwood, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sleek, Sexy and Sinister: The Costumes of Batman Returns, 2005, Warner Home Video Keaton still had difficulty hearing but found the neck movement much less restrictive on than the first costume. Due to the second costume's much thinner cowl with increased flexibility, a greater range of head turning was allotted but could still leave gaps folding away from the cheek. The infamous \\"Bat-Turn\\" movement became an iconic part of the character's body language despite not truly needing to depend upon it, contrary to speculation from contemporary pundits. The wardrobe department spent seven weeks sculpting Batman Forever costumes on his body cast, preceding under the assumption that he would be returning. The addition of nipples and an enlarged codpiece to the Batsuit and Robin's costume in Batman & Robin was the subject of criticism.Joel Schumacher, Peter MacGregor-Scott, Chris O'Donnell, Val Kilmer, Uma Thurman, John Glover, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6-Batman Unbound, 2005, Warner Home Video Film appearances =Batman (1989)= Michael Keaton as Batman The audience is first introduced to Bruce as Batman when he witnesses a mugging of a tourist family in Gotham City. He tracked the thugs who committed the crime and told them to spread word of his presence to the rest of the criminals in Gotham, when one of the criminals scaredly asks \\"Who are you?\\", he simply replies with \\"I'm Batman\\" and vanished into the night. Prior to this, there has been numerous sightings of the vigilante, and a criminal associate of the muggers', Johnny Gobb, who died after accidentally fell off from a roof (possibly while fleeing from Batman), creates a rumor that the vigilante killed Gobb in a manner of a vampire that feeds on blood and cannot be killed. Batman's reputation as a menacing creature of the night that hunts wrongdoers strikes fear on the city's superstitious and cowardly including corrupt police lieutenant Max Eckhardt, who'd rather avoid talking about him in order to hide his. Publicly, Bruce involves with the city's infrastructures, but he repeatedly absence himself from events such as a press conference headed by Mayor Borg in favor of fighting crimes on the city's streets and alleys. The next night, Bruce hosts a fundraiser at Wayne Manor to help fund the Gotham City 200th Anniversary Parade. At the party, Bruce met photographer Vicki Vale, as the two began conversing, Alfred arrived to let Bruce know that Commissioner Gordon had to leave the party quite unexpectedly. Bruce reviewed the Manor's surveillance cameras and discovered that Gordon had been summoned to Axis Chemicals due to a break-in by Jack Napier. Bruce suited up as Batman to assist Gordon in Napier's capture, knowing that the criminal's arrest might lead to crime-lord Carl Grissom's conviction and possibly ends his operations over the city. However, during the ensuing fight, a bullet ricocheted off Bruce's armor and pierced Napier's face, causing him to fall into a vat of chemicals below, seemingly killing him. Batman vanished from the scene before he could be captured by Gordon's men. The next night Bruce would share an evening with Vale where the two began to fall in love, when Vale invited Bruce to lunch the next day, Bruce turned her down, as it was the anniversary of his parents' murder. Bruce left the scene at Crime Alley and witnessed a mob hit by the confirmed alive Jack Napier, now with his face bleached white, his hair turned green and a macabre smile etched into his face, calling himself \\"The Joker\\". Bruce then discovered that Napier had poisoned various consumer products with his laughing toxin, Smylex. After further investigation into Napier, Bruce is informed by Alfred that he has a date with Vale at the Flugelheim Museum. Bruce informs Alfred that he had no plans to meet with Vale that day, and discovers that the meeting was set-up by Napier, who had intended on gaining information on Batman via Vale. As Batman, he stormed the museum and rescued Vale from Napier's men, making their escape in the Batmobile. This would result in a chase between Napier's men and Batman, which resulted in Vale capturing several photos of Batman in action. The two return back to Batman's hideout, The Batcave, where he revealed his investigation into Napier to Vale and gave her his research notes to release, before causing her to pass out with an incapacitating agent and confiscating the film from her. Due to a suggestion from Alfred, Bruce headed over to Vale's apartment to inform her that he is in fact, Batman. However, the two are interrupted by the Joker. Bruce hid a silver tray under his shirt for protection before confronting the Joker. Bruce hints that he knows The Joker is Napier, and begins to act violently, to which the Joker responds with \\"Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?\\" before shooting him. Having been protected by the tray, Bruce retreated to the Batcave, and discovers that Napier was the one who killed his parents. Bruce slipped into a flashback of his parents death due to another television broadcast by Napier, and was awoken by Vale, having been led into the Batcave by Alfred, therefore uncovering his identity to her. Bruce then suited up as Batman and raided Axis Chemicals, which he had deduced as The Joker's hideout. He witnessed The Joker make his escape via personalized helicopter, and returned to the Batcave and headed to Downtown Gotham in the Batwing. Bruce came across The Joker's parade float during the 200th Anniversary Parade, where The Joker had planned on releasing Smylex on the citizens of Gotham from the stolen parade balloons by luring the crowd through throwing money to them. After using the Batwing to dispatch of the balloons, Batman returned to the parade and killed many of The Joker's men, but was shot down by The Joker, crashing at the front steps of the Gotham Cathedral. He watched as Joker took Vale hostage and entered the Cathedral. Recovering from the crash, Batman pursued Joker and Vale into the Cathedral, eventually coming across them at the top level. Batman revealed to Napier that he had killed his parents, and thus reveals his identity and that he wants revenge. After Batman beat the Joker over the edge of the cathedral, Joker then dragged Batman and Vale with him, leaving them dangling above the streets of Gotham as the Joker's helicopter arrived to collect him and escape. Determined to fulfill his vendetta, Batman used his grapple gun to tie one of the Cathedral's gargoyles to The Joker's leg. Weighed down by the statue as he attempted to climb up the helicopter's ladder, causing the gargoyle to break free from its foundations, and causing Napier to plummet to his death. In the aftermath of taking down the Joker, the Gotham City Police Department awards Batman with his own personalized signal as a way of contacting him for cooperation. Due to his double-life as Batman however, Vale would eventually break up with Bruce, as he became more interested in the investments made by business mogul Max Shreck. =Batman Returns (1992)= During Christmas celebrations, Bruce was brought to the attention of the Batsignal in the sky, and discovered that the Red Triangle Gang (whom he and the police have been work on finding) had interrupted the Gotham City Tree Lighting Ceremony and had taken Max Shreck hostage. While Batman attempted to deter the gang, the next morning a member of the gang kidnapped the Mayor's baby during a speech denouncing the previous night's attacks. The baby is \\"saved\\" by a mysterious man called \\"The Penguin\\". The Penguin claims that he hopes to find his parents, who had abandoned him when he was an infant due to his deformities. Bruce initially felt sympathy for the Penguin, but after seeing him with Shreck, his suspicions increased considerably. Bruce discovers that Penguin was once a performer in the Red Triangle Circus, where a series of disappearances of children occurred. He then suspects that the Penguin already know who his parents were and is the gang's leader, and is planning something else. Penguin grew in popularity and discovered that his name is Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, and that both his parents were deceased. Bruce had a meeting with Shreck to contest Shreck's plans to build a new powerplant, during the meeting Bruce met Selina Kyle, Shreck's secretary, with whom Bruce begins a romantic relationship, unaware that she is the masked vigilante known as \\"Catwoman\\". Batman first encounters Catwoman during a confrontation with the Penguin, where the two come across her as she had finished vandalizing a Shreck's Department Store, and causing it to explode. Batman attempted to pursue Catwoman, only to grow confused due to her passive aggressive attacks, and attempted seductions of Batman. After returning to the Batcave, Penguin officially announced his plans to run for Mayor of Gotham City. Some nights later, Bruce and Selina share a date at Wayne Manor, and discover via television broadcast that Penguin was attempting to frame Batman using one of his Batarangs at the Relighting of the Tree Ceremony, and had kidnapped the \\"Ice Princess\\", who was supposed to press the button to light the tree. While investigating the disappearance, the members of the Red Triangle Gang begin working on modifying the Batmobile to allow The Penguin remote control access. Batman found the Ice Princess standing on the edge of a rooftop. The Penguin arrived and startled the girl by opening one of his trick-umbrellas and causing a swarm of bats, which knocks her off the roof to plummet to her death. She landed on the button used to light the tree, causing a mass swarm of bats to attack the onlookers. Batman gets shot at by the Gotham City Police Department upon his attempted escape, due to his reputation and the apparent evidence that places him as the culprit of the murder. Batman fended off Catwoman and returned to the Batmobile, which has now been hacked by The Penguin, who takes the car on a destructive joyride. Despite regaining control of the vehicle, Penguin's plan had succeeded and Batman's reputation as a hero had been tarnished. In retaliation, Bruce hacked into the Gotham Plaza's speakers and played the incriminating quotes Penguin had said over the monitor during the joyride during one of his public speeches. Penguin reacts violently to the crowds backlash and opens fire on them and flees the scene, with Shreck rescinding his support of Cobblepot. Meanwhile Bruce made plans to attend Shreck's masquerade ball in hopes of running into Selina. The two meet at the party, neither of them wearing costumes, and Selina suffers a mental breakdown and announces to Bruce her plans to kill Shreck. While attempting to console Selina, she makes an off-hand comment that leads to Bruce and Selina deducing each other's secret identities. The two left to sort out their issues as Penguin crashed through the floor of the room, announcing his plans to kill all of the first-born sons of Gotham, and takes Shreck hostage. Batman arrived and interrogated Penguin's right-hand man, The Organ Grinder, and learned of Penguin's hideout underneath the Arctic World exhibit at the abandoned Gotham Zoo. Batman entered the Gotham Sewers via Batboat as Alfred worked to hack Cobblepot's pet penguins armed with missiles who were marching into Gotham Plaza to claim more lives. Batman confronted Penguin and used his own penguin army to fire their missiles at The Penguin's hideout, causing Cobblepot to fall through the skylight into the pool of toxic waste he had used to kill the children. Batman then attempted to stop Selina from killing Shreck, confirming their identities to each other, his attempts to calm Selina did not work, as Selina used a taser she had acquired during the Red Triangle Gang's initial attack to electrocute and murder Shreck, and caused the power generator to explode. Bruce searched for Selina in the wreckage, only to find the charred corpse of Shreck. Penguin rises from the sewage and bleeds to death, with Bruce watching as his penguin army dragged him into the water to serve as his grave. Bruce began driving around the streets of Gotham hoping to find Selina. After believing to have seen her silouhette, Bruce pursues her down an alleyway, only to find a black cat there which he adopts. Other appearances =Batman Forever (1995)= Due to the backlash Batman Returns faced from parents who believed the film was too dark for children, Burton left the franchise and was replaced by Joel Schumacher. Burton's exit prompted Keaton to leave the franchise as well, turning down $15 million to reprise the role. The film was reworked as Batman Forever which featured Val Kilmer as Batman. Ethan Hawke, Tom Hanks, Kurt Russell, William Baldwin, Ralph Fiennes (who would later voice Alfred Pennyworth in The Lego Batman Movie), Daniel Day-Lewis and Johnny Depp were all considered to be Keaton's replacement before Kilmer's casting. Bruce decides to invest more time in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, and while visiting applied sciences, he becomes acquainted with Edward Nygma, an employee obsessed with him and who has developed a machine, the Box, capable of transmitting television signals directly into the human brain. Bruce turns Nygma down due to the potential dangers of the device, and in retaliation, Nygma kills his supervisor, stages it as a suicide and resigns from the company. At the same time, as Batman, he comes into conflict with former district attorney Harvey Dent, whom he failed to save from an accident which transformed him into the supervillain Two-Face and who is now bent on revenge on Batman, becoming acquainted with psychologist Dr. Chase Meridian in the process, who has briefly come to Gotham to help capture Two-Face and who becomes enamored of the Dark Knight. During a charity circus performance, Bruce witnesses Two-Face attack and murder the Flying Graysons, leaving only the youngest, Dick Grayson, alive. Bruce takes Dick in as his ward. Dick soon discovers that Bruce is Batman, and demands that he help him find and kill Two-Face in revenge, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma watches Two-Face's attack on television and takes on the moniker of the Riddler, tracking him down and enlisting his help in funding mass production of his Box in order to absorb all of Gotham City's knowledge and bring the city under his rule, promising him Batman's true identity in return. Bruce and Chase soon start a romantic relationship and she also discovers that he is Batman, as do the Riddler and Two-Face, who attack Wayne Manor, take Chase hostage and destroy the Batcave. In retaliation, after learning that Nygma is the Riddler from several riddles that Nygma had previously left him, Batman tracks them to their hideout, the Mother Box near Gotham bay, with help from Dick, now going by the name \\"Robin\\". While Batman manages to break into the lair, Robin confronts and briefly fights Two-Face, but is subdued and also captured. Batman confronts the Riddler, who gives him the choice to save either Chase or Robin, but Batman instead destroys the Mother Box, severely damaging the Riddler's mind, and manages to save both Chase and Robin. Two-Face corners them at gunpoint, and while flipping his coin to decide their fates, Batman throws a handful of coins at him, causing him to fall to his death, avenging Dick's family. Nygma is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum, where his scrambled memories have left him believing that he himself is Batman. Chase and Bruce bid each other farewell with a kiss, while Bruce accepts Dick as his crimefighting partner. Batman Forever received mixed-to-negative reviews from fans and critics, many believing the film was too campy and diminished the tone established in Burton's original. =Batman & Robin (1997)= The film was followed with a sequel, Batman & Robin which featured George Clooney as Batman since Kilmer decide not to reprise the role. In the film, Batman and Robin face off against Mr. Freeze, who has been committing a string of diamond thefts. After Freeze freezes but spares Robin in order to escape, Bruce chastises Dick, who starts to chafe under Bruce's leadership. Bruce deduces that Freeze is Dr. Victor Fries, whose wife Nora is suffering from MacGregor's Syndrome and whom Fries has placed in cryogenic sleep while he searches for a cure. Fries was mutated after a lab accident that left his body unable to withstand room temperature, which leaves him dependent on his cryosuit to survive. In order to lure Freeze out, Bruce hosts a charity ball auctioning off the Wayne family diamonds with himself and Dick attending as Batman and Robin. The ensuing battle and chase results in Freeze's capture. At the same time, both Bruce and Dick become acquainted with Wayne Enterprises employee Dr. Pamela Isley, who was previously mutated into Poison Ivy at the hands of Dr. Jason Woodrue after she witnessed his illegal experiments that created Bane, and who murdered Woodrue in retaliation and has come to Gotham with Bane, proposing a project to Bruce to save nature. Bruce politely turns her down, so she decides to fracture Batman and Robin's partnership by seducing Robin and allying with Freeze, breaking him out of Arkham. When Freeze initially appears uninterested in Ivy's proposal, as his plan was to use the Wayne Enterprises telescope at Gotham Observatory to freeze part of Gotham and hold it ransom in order to get funding for his research, Ivy pulls the plug on Nora's chamber and frames Batman for it; a grieving Freeze subsequently decides to freeze all of humanity instead as revenge against Batman, after which Ivy proposes that they repopulate Earth with mutant plants. At the same time, Alfred's niece, Barbara Wilson, comes to visit Wayne Manor and meets Bruce and Dick. Dick soon discovers Barbara participating in illegal motorbike races in order to win money to take Alfred back to England, upon which she reveals that Alfred is ill and dying of MacGregor's Syndrome. Ivy and Bane steal the Bat-Signal and alter it into a Robin signal to lure Robin out, but Bruce pleads with Dick to trust him that Ivy is working with Freeze. The two work together and trick Ivy into revealing her plan. Barbara manages to access the Batcave, where a hologram of Alfred reveals that due to Barbara's previous martial arts training and witnessing Bruce and Dick drifting apart, he had constructed a Batsuit for her to aid them. Taking on the moniker of Batgirl, Barbara intervenes and defeats Ivy, and the three of them head to the observatory to stop Freeze. Robin and Batgirl defeat Bane while Batman faces and subdues Freeze, redirecting the telescope's satellites to reflect the sunlight to thaw Gotham, but Freeze detonates several bombs that he had placed around the telescope, destroying it, though Robin and Batgirl are still able to thaw the city. Defeated, Freeze begs Batman to kill him and end his suffering, but Batman reveals Ivy's treachery and that Nora is still alive, having been rescued in time. Batman appeals to Freeze's humanity and asks him for the cure to MacGregor Syndrome's early stages to save Alfred. Freeze provides him with the cure and is returned to Arkham, where he is allowed to continue his research. Alfred makes a full recovery and reunites with Bruce, Dick and Barbara. Their family bond stronger than before, the three form a surrogate family of crimefighters. The film gained overwhelmingly negative reviews, with many citing it as one of the worst comic book movies ever made, if not one of the worst films of all time. =The Flash (2022)= On June 22, 2020, TheWrap reported that Michael Keaton was in early negotiations to reprise his role of Bruce Wayne / Batman in the DC Extended Universe film The Flash (2022). On August 20, Vanity Fair confirmed Keaton's casting, being one of the variations of Batman that will appear in the film along with Ben Affleck's version of the character. Comic appearances =Film adaptations= A comic adaptation of Tim Burton's Batman titled Batman: The Official Comic Adaptation of the Warner Bros Motion Picture was released in June 1989. The story was written by the film's screenplay writer Sam Hamm, along with comic writer Dennis O'Neil, with art provided by Jerry Ordway. A comic adaptation for Batman Returns titled Batman Returns: The Official Comic Adaptation of the Warner Bros Motion Picture was released in June 1992. The story was once again written by Sam Hamm and Dennis O' Neil, with art provided by Steve Erwin. =Possible canonical comic continuation= A comic continuation that was to chronicle the events of Tim Burton's failed third Batman film titled Batman '89 was submitted to DC Comics written by Joe Quinones and Kath Leth. The run was inspired by DC's recent comic run Batman '66, which was a continuation of the 1966 television series starring Adam West and Burt Ward. The story was to continue the events of Tim Burton's Batman franchise with visual allusions to Michael Keaton as Batman, Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, Marlon Wayans as Robin, Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, and Robin Williams as The Riddler. The story would also introduce iterations of Barbara Gordon, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn into the world. However, the comic run was rejected by DC. In other media =Television= *Keaton's Batman was referenced in the Arrowverse television crossover event \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", where it was revealed that Bruce Wayne had married Selina Kyle in a newspaper article. This series establishes the universe in which Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) exist as Earth-89, with Robert Wuhl, who portrayed Alexander Knox in Batman, reprising his role for the series for a cameo appearance. =Video games= *The suit from Tim Burton's Batman films was added as an alternate skin to Batman: Arkham Knight during a free update in August 2015. Reception and legacy Michael Keaton's portrayal as Batman was seen as hugely influential towards further adaptations of the character. Keaton's portrayal inspired the portrayal by Kevin Conroy in Batman: The Animated Series, as well as Christian Bale's portrayal of the character in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy. As the first version of the character to carry a grapple device with a motorized reel, as well a cape that can harden and transform into a hang-glider, these concepts would become highly influential for most contemporary appearances of the character. Keaton's distant, monosyllabic persona in-costume has been payed tribute to throughout multiple adaptations of the character, including video game appearances and homages. This adaptation of the character was also seen as the first to change their voice while in costume as Batman, something which future actors Kevin Conroy, Ben Affleck and Christian Bale would also add to their interpretations. Michael Keaton's portrayal of the character appears on AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains at #46 on the heroes side, while Jack Nicholson's portrayal as the Joker ranked 45th on the villains side. =Birdman comparisons= Due to his involvement in the film, Michael Keaton's role in the film Birdman directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu has been compared to Keaton's own experiences as Batman. Many people have come to the conclusion that the film is a reflection of Michael Keaton's life post-Batman, as the film itself focuses on a struggling, aging actor who is best known for having played a winged superhero earlier in his career. When Inarritu contacted Keaton about taking the role of Riggan, Keaton asked him if he was making fun of him for playing Batman. Despite comparisons between Riggan and Keaton and many people believing that the role was taken by the actor to let out frustration at the role, Keaton has claimed that he loves talking about his time as Batman, and is extremely grateful for the role. Keaton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in Birdman, his first ever nomination, and this was what helped him gain the villainous role of The Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It was used to move water uphill to irrigate agricultural land on the plateau above the Snake River. It was located about south of Hagerman at Thousand Springs. The area is now Thousand Springs State Park. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1975. History The ram was started by William W. Priestly to capture water, which emerged from the Snake River Aquifer on the north slope of the Snake River Canyon as spring-fed waterfalls and pump it to the top of the cliff. The ram utilized the force of the falling water to pump the water up the cliff. Priestly started work on the project in 1888, intending to develop an irrigation system for the farmland south of Hagerman. The ram, although credited to Priestly, may have actually been built in 1901‚Äì02 by David Hyde. During its construction, a competitor, North Side Irrigation, developed an alternate system and the ram was apparently never used commercially. It was reported to have been functional in 1901. According to an alternate account, Priestly built the ram in 1894 and was successful raising water and using it for irrigation at that time. He then turned his attention to gold mining, and used the same air-ram principle in the construction of a gold dredge in 1896. Description The ram used diameter pipes to collect spring water, mixed with air, and send it falling downhill into a metal reservoir tank. The design of the tank caused the water to drain out into the river while harnessing the kinetic energy of the falling water to force air uphill through a second pipe to the reservoir tank of a second smaller ram that was fed with water dropped from a higher spring via a third pipe. The air pressure from the two rams was combined to push water to the top of the cliff through a fourth smaller pipe. According to the NRHP nomination form, \\"Priestly's hydraulic ram, a pump with not one moving part, was considered truly marvelous.\\" Although a similar but less sophisticated ram was built in Arizona several years before, Priestly is believed to have designed his ram independently. Similar devices were built around that time (near Montreal, Quebec in 1896, Ainsworth, British Columbia in 1898 and Norwich, Connecticut in 1902). The technology did not find widespread use because the devices, which were about 70% efficient, were soon eclipsed by more efficient pumps powered by steam, gasoline, and electricity. The ram is notable because \\"few such original developments in the field of power transmission have been made anywhere in the United States.\\" Present According to the NRHP nomination form from 1974, parts of the pipeline and the storage tank still existed. The nomination included two photos, one of a pipeline and one of the reservoir, both credited to the Twin Falls Times News and purported to have been taken in 1973. It is not clear what happened to these pieces after that. Idaho Power Company senior archaeologist Shane Baker said: \\"It may have been taken apart and salvaged for parts. Or moved somewhere else, or perhaps abandoned in place. To my knowledge, no one has ever found any remnants of the facility. The exact location for the ram is unknown, and it may be possible that the first hydroelectric plant built at Thousand Springs in 1912 may have been built over top of the location of the old ram.\\" See also *Waterwheel (McCoy, Colorado), device also used to lift water 32 feet for use in irrigation.

Biography  He received his initial lessons in art from , who was sufficiently impressed by his talent that he helped him obtain a Ducal Scholarship; enabling him to study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, beginning in 1821. He remained there for three years, while attempting to become a private student of Caspar David Friedrich. Those efforts were in vain so, in 1824, he relocated to Berlin, where he found employment with the stage designer and diorama painter, Karl Wilhelm Gropius. Later, he became a student of Karl Wilhelm Wach. During this time, he supported himself by singing at the K√∂nigsst√§dtisches Theater. By 1830, he was earning enough from his painting to devote himself to it exclusively. He had decided to specialize in marine painting, but he always put some landscaping in the foreground. Several study trips to the sea were taken for inspiration. In 1830, he travelled with his friend, Rudolf Jordan, to R√ºgen. He also travelled to Norway (1831), Holland (1834) and Normandy (1836). He wandered further afield, to Rngland and Scotland, in 1842. Later he undertook study trips to coasts of France, Italy and Greece. He was the first to introduce marine painting to Berlin and attracted a group of followers there; notably Hermann Eschke, Eduard Hildebrandt, and Fritz Bamberger. In 1833, the Prussian Academy of Sciences accepted him as a full member. he published a book in 1846: Painting Techniques of the Masters of the 15th to 18th Century, rediscovered by Prof. Wilhelm Krause in Berlin.\\"Die Maler-Technik der Meister des 15. bis 18.

Mahood grew up on Mongrel Downs in the Northern Territory of Australia, then known as Tanami Downs Station. Her early life there features heavily in her work, including in her two-part biography Craft for a Dry Lake (2000) and Position Doubtful: mapping landscapes and memories (2016).  Biography  Mahood was born in 1953 to parents, Alexander (always known as Joe) and Marie Mahood, who had worked across the Northern Territory on various cattle stations and, when Mahood was born, her father was employed by the Department of Native Affairs on the newly established Hooker Creek Native Settlement (now known as Lajamanu) until they relocated due to Mahood's health deteriorating and they were relocated to Beswick in Arnhem Land. However, due to a number of frustrations of the bureaucracy of working for the Department of Native Affairs, Mahood's father soon left to work for Colonel Rose in the Animal Industry Branch (AIB) and this job meant that the family travelled throughout the Northern Territory on a regular basis and the family spent four years living in Finke as a part of her father's role. When the family left Finke, now with four children, the family relocated to Alice Springs before where her father pursued work as a cartoonist and her mother taught French at the local high school. The Mahood family took up the lease on Mongrel Downs Station in 1962 alongside Bill Wilson. There are many stories and disagreements about where this name came from with many Warlipiri people believing it is a distortion of the Warlpiri name for Lake Ruth, Monkarrurpa, while a former NT Administrator believed it was a personal dig at him. However, Mahood believes that it is in response to the popular perception that it was a \\"mongrel bit of country\\" and that they were crazy to try to establish a station there. In 1971 the partnership between Joe Mahood and Bill Wilson dissolved and the Mahood family moved to Central Queensland, where they established Cattle Camp Station. Joe was killed helicopter mustering in 1990 and this sad event prompted Mahood to make her first trip back to Mongrel Downs in 1992. Mahood's first biography \\"Craft for a dry lake\\" (2000), which won the NSW Premier's Award for non-fiction and was named The Age Book of the Year for non-fiction, is the result of this journey and she says: Mahood's second biography \\"Position Doubtful: mapping landscapes and memories\\" (2016) tracks her itinerant life and work since her first and remains focused on Central Australia and exploring her \\"unusual position at the interface of cultures\\". This book was shortlisted for the 2017 Victorian Premier's Award for non-fiction, the Queensland Literary Awards, the ACT Book of the Year and the National Biography Award.

He is a Living National Treasure of Japan.  Biography  Moriguchi was born in 1941 in Kyoto. He is the second son of Kako Moriguchi, another well-known yuzen dyer. Moriguchi graduated from the Kyoto City University of Arts in 1963, then traveled to Paris to study at the Ecole des Arts Decoratifs. He was the first Japanese person to earn a scholarship from the French government to study in France. While in France he happened to meet and befriend Balthus, who encouraged him to follow in his father's footsteps rather than becoming a graphic designer in Europe. Moriguchi returned to Japan and began working in his father's workshop in 1967, when he was 26. He began exhibiting his work that year. He married Keiko Terada in 1975. Moriguchi received the Japanese Medal of Honor (purple ribbon) in 2001. In 2007, Moriguchi was named a Living National Treasure of Japan. In 2013, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (gold rays with neck ribbon).  Style  Much like his father before him, Moriguchi takes his inspiration from nature. Once he has an nature-inspired motif, he transforms it into an abstract, geometric shape. He prioritizes a sense of fluidity, and makes certain that the kimonos he creates are as beautiful when they are being worn as they are when they are being displayed. He drafts his designs on paper, then paints them on white silk crepe. He makes his dyes from scratch. Moriguchi's work is held by several museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Hiroshima Prefectural Art Museum, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, and the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto. He has also regularly exhibited at the Japanese Traditional Art Crafts Exhibition since 1967.

History  The waterfall was named after the story relating to the story of a king who had many queens, according to the ancient myth and tales. On his return from war, he assured them that he would give all his wives, a sign from the hills about the fate of the war. He said that if his soldiers waved a white flag over the hills, it would mean he was defeated and killed in action and further said that if he waved his own flag bearing his crest, that he was victorious.

It is the third-highest point of the Fitzsimmons Range, which is a subset of the Garibaldi Ranges. It is situated southeast of Whistler, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Benvolio, to the west- southwest. The Diavolo Glacier spreads out below the southeast aspect of the summit, and the Fitzsimmons Glacier descends the northwest slopes. Precipitation runoff from the peak and meltwater from its glaciers drains into tributaries of the Cheakamus River. The first ascent of the mountain was made on August 19, 1924, by a party of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club. The peak was named for prospector James Fitzsimmons, who built a trail along Fitzsimmons Creek in an effort to haul supplies to a small copper mine he staked and worked. The mountain's name was officially adopted on September 2, 1930, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Mt. Fitzsimmons' NE face Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Fitzsimmons is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Fitzsimmons.

Devonian age volcanic rocks and a granite pluton form the Cheviot massif. The geology of the rest of the national park is characterised largely by a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous age. These are intruded by Permian dykes and sills, of which the Whin Sill makes a significant impact in the south of the park. Further dykes were intruded during the Palaeogene period. The whole is overlain by unconsolidated sediments from the last ice age and the post-glacial period.British Geological Survey 1:625,000 scale geological map Bedrock Geology UK North 5th Edn. NERC 2007 The exploitation of various of these rocks and deposits has contributed to economic activity in the area and left a number of legacies in the landscape. Various archaeological and historical sites are associated with the geological landscape, not least Hadrian's Wall built in large part by the Romans along the outcrop of the Whin Sill. This landscape and that of the Cheviot Hills were key to the area's designation as a national park in 1956. Underlying geological structure The national park sits astride the Iapetus suture, the line along which the former Iapetus Ocean closed during the Silurian period as the former micro-continent of Avalonia to the south collided with the continent of Laurentia to the north. The suture and the great slab of subducted oceanic crust from beneath the former ocean are concealed from view by a thickness of sedimentary rocks which subsequently accumulated over the area. During the Devonian period a granite pluton was emplaced in the north (under what is now the Cheviot Hills) and volcanic activity led to the accumulation of various volcanic rocks whilst to the south (under what is now the North Pennines, a granite batholith was emplaced. During the Carboniferous period, a series of blocks and basins developed across what would eventually become northern England. An upstanding Cheviot Block and an upstanding Alston Block were separated by the Solway-Basin ‚Äì Northumberland Trough Silurian Greywackes originating during the Wenlock epoch (428 ‚Äì 422 Ma bp) of the Silurian Period are assigned to the Riccarton Group and occupy an area either side of the border with Scotland to the north of Byrness. The rocks exposed in the Coquet Head inlier are turbidites. Devonian =Old Red Sandstone= The late Devonian Stratheden Group is characterised by sandstones with subordinate siltstones and mudstones. A couple of very small area sof these rocks straddle the border to the southwest of The Cheviot. =Igneous rocks= Rocks assigned to the Cheviot Volcanic Formation, itself within the Reston Group, straddle the border with Scotland. This thick pile (over 1000m) of andesitic lavas was erupted during the early Devonian. The sequence includes rhyolites, agglomerates and tuff. The Cheviot Pluton is a mass of Devonian granite. =Metamorphic rock= The intense heat associated with the Cheviot pluton has led to the thermal metamorphism of rocks within its aureole. Hornfelsed volcanic rocks form tors within the Cheviot massif as at The Schil and Auchope Cairn.(https://www.northumberlandnationalpark.org.uk/things-to-do/enjoy- nature/geology/rocks/)  Carboniferous  Sedimentary rocks of Carboniferous age underlie the southern two-thirds of the national park. The oldest of these rocks within the park are assigned to the Inverclyde Group. Overlying these are the rocks of the Border Group and the youngest ones within the park are assigned to the overlying Yoredale Group. =Inverclyde Group= The Inverclyde Group extends into the park in places along its northeastern margin. =Border Group= Rocks of the Border Group extend west from Rothbury to the northern end of Kielder Water. The group is divided into a lower Lyne Formation and an upper Fell Sandstone Formation. The former is absent in the park but the latter reaches up to 370m thickness and is locally prominent around Rothbury Forest where it also forms the Simonside Hills which reach a height of 440m at Tosson Hill. In some areas it forms bold crags such as those at Bowden Doors. =Yoredale Group= The Yoredale Group comprises, in stratigraphic order i.e. lowermost/oldest first, the Tyne Limestone Formation, Alston Formation and Stainmore Formation. This succession is formed from mudstones, siltstones, sandstones and limestone. The Tyne Limestone occupies a large area around Otterburn, Bellingham and Kielder Reservoir extending west to the Cumbrian border. The overlying Alston Formation extends south from the Scottish border along the coastal strip before turning inland through Alnwick towards Greenhead. It plays host to the intrusive Whin Sill. Permian The tholeiitic basalt of the Whin Sill was emplaced during early Permian times. The quartz-dolerite was emplaced within lower Carboniferous bedrock in a sheet which extends south and east fromjust within the southern margin of the park. It is typically 30m thick. A series of dyke sub-swarms is associated with the sill. Those within Northumberland are referred to as the Holy Island, High Green and St. Oswald's subswarms. The sill provides the extended north-facing scarp on which the Roman emperor Hadrian had his eponymous wall built. This sill is considered the original sill within geological science; sill is a local term for a broadly flat-lying body of rock and is now used for igneous intrusions parallel to bedding on a worldwide basis. Palaeogene Numerous dykes of Palaeogene age cut the sedimentary rocks of the county. The most significant is the Acklington Dyke which running roughly east-southeastwards from the vicinity of the Scottish town of Hawick parallels the course of the Coquet, running just north of Rothbury and through the village of Acklington towards the coast. The dyke which occasionally achieves a width of 30m emanates from a source in the Mull igneous centre in the west of Scotland.Stone, P. et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edn) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey),pp184-5 Quaternary  = Glacial legacy = Much of the park is mantled by glacial till from the last i.e. Devensian glaciation. There are also a number of areas of glacio- fluvial sands and gravels representing glacially derived material re-worked by rivers. All of this material, till and glacio-fluvial deposits, is assigned to the Caledonia Glacigenic Group; within the park, several different sub-groups are recognised according to the source of the material. North of the Cheviot massif, the till is assigned to the Borders Subgroup and to the south to the North Pennine Subgroup whilst that associated with the massif itself is classed as Cheviot Subgroup. The Pennine tills are generally dark grey reflecting the nature of the Carboniferous bedrock from which they largely originate.Stone, P. et al 2010 British Regional Geology: Northern England (5th edn) (Keyworth, Nottingham: British Geological Survey), pp212-3British Geological Survey 1:625,000 scale geological map Quaternary Map of the United Kingdom South 1st Edn. 1977 Numerous glacial meltwater channels occur in the area between Ingram and Alwinton. =Peat= Large parts of the national park's uplands are blanketed by peat. = Alluvium = The floors of the main river valleys are formed by alluvium, sand, silts and gravel laid down by rivers and streams. River terraces are evident along the Tyne valley and three terraces are developed along that of the River Tweed. Terraces are also developed along the course of the Till, Aln, Coquet, Font, Wansbeck and Breamish. Geological conservation and protection Northumberland National Park Authority engaged the British Geological Survey to carry out a geodiversity audit of the national park and the subsequent publication in 2007 of a geodiversity action plan was the first for any national park in the UK. It identified 38 geodiversity sites in addition to existing designated sites.

Life and painting  Mulda was born in Titjikala, 130 km from Alice Springs, and went to school in Amoonguna. A childhood accident left Mulda with vision impairment and losing the use of her left arm. Mulda moved to Alice Springs as a young woman and lives at Abbott's Town Camp (see Alice Springs Town Camps). Mulda began painting early but it wasn't until she started working with Tangentyere Artists in 2008 that she started painting in what has now become her distinct style; this was assisted by surgery to improve her eyesight. Mulda is known for her figurative and naive painting style in which she depicts many scenes from around Alice Springs including trees, homes, shops and figures. Equally important to this style is Mulda's addition of cursive script which is unique to her and introduces the paintings subject; all of which are political. Mulda paints about everyday life for Aboriginal people in Alice Springs, especially those living in town camps, and shows their gritty reality. A particular focus of her work is interactions between Aboriginal people and police and especially in relation to alcohol. Following the Intervention in 2007, it is illegal to buy and consume alcohol if you live in an Aboriginal community or a town camp; despite this it is easier to purchase alcohol when living in a town camp than more remotely and this has led to significant overcrowding in town camps and an increased police presence.

Wittmann (born 11 January 1944) is a German psychologist, evaluation researcher and research methodologist.Research gate: Werner WittmannLeibnitz Psychologie - PsychAuthors: Prof. em. Dr. Werner WittmannLibrary of Congress Authorities: Wittmann Werner W.  Biography  Werner W. Wittmann grew up in Nuremberg, where he completed his Abitur in 1964. He studied psychology at the University of Freiburg (Diploma degree 1972) and received his doctorate in 1977 with a thesis on factor-analytical models, methodological studies and problems of reproducibility. In his habilitation in 1984, he dealt with the topic of evaluation research, which was published in 1985 as a book by Springer-Verlag. From 1973 to 1984 Werner W. Wittmann was a scientific assistant at the Psychological Institute of the University of Freiburg at the chair of Personality Psychology (Jochen Fahrenberg), where he was appointed to a temporary professorship with a focus on methodology in 1984. From 1988 to 1993 he was a C2 professor at the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and from 1993 to his retirement in 2009 he held the chair of Psychology II, Methods, Diagnostics and Evaluation at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Mannheim. His interest in collaborative research projects, teaching and international exchange led to several visiting professorships, among others at the universities Heidelberg, Berlin. (FU), Bern, Fribourg (Switzerland), Vienna and San Diego (SDSU). From 2006 to 2009 Werner Wittmann was head of the Otto-Selz-Institute at the University of Mannheim and subsequently became head of a department for evaluation, diagnostics and methods at the same institute. Werner W. Wittmann is/was member of the editorial board of several scientific journals, among others. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, Zeitschrift f√ºr Personalpsychologie, Diagnostica, Applied Measurement und Praxis Klinische Verhaltensmedizin und Rehabilitation.  Research  At the centre of Werner Wittmann's work is an attempt to unite the sometimes contradictory methods and goals of experimental and non-experimental research approaches in the social and behavioural sciences. His work is based on works by Lee Cronbach, Donald T. Campbell, Thomas D. Cook, R.F. Boruch, Egon Brunswik, L. Sechrest, Gene V. Glass, Raymond Bernard Cattell and Kenneth Hammond. The central focus of Werner Wittmann's research and scientific theory is on considerations of a multivariate reliabilitys and validity theory (esp. Wittmann, 1985, 1988). It was proposed as a possible solution to the general covariation problem described by Jochen Fahrenberg (Fahrenberg, 1982) of the multi-method approach in psychological diagnostics (so-called Multitrait-Multimethod-MTMM-Approach). The core is the model of the 4, later 5 data boxes (Five-Box-Model, Wittmann, 1990), a model for the conception, execution and evaluation of evaluation studies, which was mainly used in rehabilitation and intelligence research. It is based on Cattell's data box BDRM Basic Data Relation Matrix (Raymond Cattell, 1966) and Brunswik's lens model (Brunswik, 1956). In addition to the five related data boxes, the main determinants are the symmetry principle and the principle of data aggregation. Werner Wittmann's integrative thinking made him a pioneer of evaluation research in Germany, opened up new perspectives for solving fundamental challenges of translational research methodology, and made him a pioneer of evidence-based decisions in health care. In recognition of his contributions to evaluation research, Werner Wittmann received the 2005 F.

History The Banu Ammar were descended from the Berber tribe of the Kutama, which provided the mainstay of the early Fatimid Caliphate. The dynasty was founded by Amin al-Dawla Abu Talib al-Hasan ibn Ammar, who was the Fatimid-appointed qadi of Tripoli when the local Fatimid governor, Mukhtar al-Dawla ibn Bazzal, died in 1070. Amin al-Dawla declared himself the independent ruler of the town, ruling a territory extending from Akkar in the north to Jubayl in the south. His reign was brief, as he died only two years later. Amin al-Dawla's two nephews fought for the succession, with one of them, Jalal al-Mulk Ali ibn Muhammad, emerging victorious and exiling his brother. Jalal al-Mulk ruled until his death in 1099, ruling the city in a precarious diplomatic balancing act between the Fatimids to the south and the Seljuks to the east. In 1081, he captured Jableh from the Byzantine Empire. As part of his strategy to enhance Tripoli's position, he invested large sums in turning the city a famous centre for learning, founding a \\"House of Knowledge\\" that attracted scholars, as well as a notable library of reportedly 10,000 volumes. He was succeeded by his brother, Fakhr al-Mulk, whose accession coincided with the arrival of the First Crusade. He had to face the continuous attacks of the Crusaders under Raymond of Saint-Gilles. He left the city in 1108 to rally the Sunni rulers at Damascus and Baghdad to his assistance, but was deposed by the populace in a pro-Fatimid revolt. The Fatimids sent a fleet to the city, but it arrived only eight days after its fall to the Crusaders. Fakhr al-Mulk remained in the service of the Seljuks, and then entered the service of the atabeg Mawdud of Mosul, and finally of the Abbasid caliph al-Mustazhir. He died in 1118/9.

Life  Abbot Leodegar was the son of the baker Heinrich B√ºrgisser and of Anna Maria Wey. He received his education at the Jesuit College in Lucerne from 18 October 1651 and at the school in Saint Gall from 15 October 1653. He took his religious vows on 27 May 1657 and directly received the low consecrations; on 17 December 1661 he became subdeacon, on 19 May 1663 deacon, and on 20 September 1664 priest. In the following year (1665), he acted as a teacher of syntax. On 29 May of the same year, he became brother inspector. Between 1666 and 1672, Leodegar operated as kitchen master. In 1667, he is mentioned as pastor in Wildhaus; on 11 October 1672, he became pastor in St. Peterzell and in 1673, he is mentioned as pastor in Hemberg. On 26 September 1673, he became administrator in Ebringen. Abbot Gall appointed Leodegar subprior on 15 September 1681 and dean on 14 June 1683. In 1682, he moreover acted as confessor in Notkersegg and as pupils' prefect. With Cardinal Celestino Sfondrati and the Abbots Raphael von Einsiedeln and Plazidus von Muri as chairmen, Leodegar was elected abbot on 10 January 1696. Pope Innocent XII confirmed him on 18 June 1683. The benediction was given to him by Auxiliary bishop Franz Christoph Rinck von Baldenstein from Eichst√§tt, a brother of the Saint Gall estate overseer Wilhelm, on 4 November 1696. This was potentially a way to save money as the Bishop of Konstanz was compassed. Emperor Leopold I confirmed the prerogatives to Leodegar on 13 August 1697, Emperor Joseph I on 22 November 1706 and Emperor Charles VI on 24 March 1713. As new abbot, Leodegar began receiving homage on 8 May 1696 in the Old Landscape (dt. \\"Alte Landschaft\\"), in Toggenburg and in the Rhine Valley. He was on the run when he died of a heart failure in Neu-Ravensburg on 28 November 1717. He was entombed next to Abbot Kilian in the Abbey of Wettingen- Mehrerau.  Works  Werner Vogler states that Abbot Leodegar's reputation would have been better, had he lived in more favourable times and been confronted with adversaries exhibiting a greater willingness to compromise. He would be called a very strenuous abbot as during his time the abbey was apparently characterised by immaculate discipline; Leodegar himself is said to have led an exemplary monastic life and his housekeeping was good. In times of peace, he also executed a general investiture and tried in vain to establish a higher school in Rorschach. Vogler sees the reason for Leodegar's bad reputation in the circumstances described below. = Conflicts = In the first instance, the denominational conflicts in Saint Gall reemerged because crosses had been carried during the procession through the city. This was a provocation to the Protestant citizens and initiated the so called Kreuzkrieg (en. \\"war of the cross\\"). It proceeded without bloodshed and could be settled during the Conference of Rorschach from 10 May to 8 June 1697. The conclusion of the conference was one year later complemented by the Tagsatzung with the verdict that the city had to pay the monastery 3800 fl. as satisfaction. Probably in order to better protect himself, Abbot Leodegar concluded a defence contract with Emperor Leopold I in 1702 which enraged some of the Swiss. When he made great purchases (17'700 gulden) in Toggenburg in order to buy property and the people of Wattwil refused to assist him in building the Rickenstrasse, lengthy conflicts with the Toggenburger ensued as they belonged to the other denomination and were unsatisfied with their legal status. Eventually, they occupied three castles and from April 1712 onwards also Magdenau Abbey and the Abbey Neu St. Johann. Zurich supported Toggenburg's attempts at freedom, which in truth circled around the inner constitution of Toggenburg, time and again, which led to the outbreak of war in 1712. The abbatial city of Wil was captured by the allied people of Zurich, Bern and Toggenburg, whereupon Abbot Leodegar fled, accompanied by his convent, from Rorschach into exile: first to Mehrerau and then to Castle Neu-Ravensburg, the centre of administration of a Saint Gall dominion north of Lindau. For the intervening time, he installed a Judicial vicar, namely Pastor Johann Georg Schenkli from Rorschach (1712‚Äì1718). The Z√ºrcher and Berner, however, took the abbatial lands and conjointly governed them. Thereupon, the theft of mobile monastery goods took place which, as so-called Kulturg√ºterstreit, has consequences to this day. As one of his last official acts, Abbot Leodegar discarded the peace that had been negotiated with Zurich and Bern in Rorschach on 28 November 1717; he beheld the rights of the abbey as largely restricted and the Catholic religion in Toggenburg as endangered.

It is also known by the title of its refrain, \\"Wir haben hier keine bleibende Stadt\\" (We have no lasting residence here). The song was written in 1993, in the genre Neues Geistliches Lied (NGL). It appears in several regional sections of the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, and in other songbooks.  History and text  The hymn was written for the conclusion of a festive service for the inauguration of the new Seminary Church at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in Frankfurt in 1993. It was the last part of a mass created for the occasion, the \\"Sankt Georgener Messe\\". The texts of all seven parts of the mass were written by Eugen Eckert, used for introit, Kyrie, Halleluja, intercessions, Sanctus, thanks, and conclusion. The concluding song is in four similar stanzas, each with four verse lines and four lines of refrain. The song was first performed in the mass on 24 April 1993, with the choir and instrumental ensemble of Sankt Georgen conducted by the composer. It appears in regional parts of the German Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, as GL 916 for the Diocese of Freiburg, and as GL 847 for the Diocese of Limburg, in the section Segen (Blessing).  Text and content  Eugen Eckert, who wrote the text, in Frankfurt in 2008 The text of the refrain is derived from the Letter to the Hebrews, speaking of no permanent place here but searching for a future place, which is a line also used by Johannes Brahms at the beginning of the sixth movement of Ein deutsches Requiem (Hebrews 13:14). A present church is a tent of meeting with God, a wording which was used in a papal central document of the Second Vatican Council, Lumen gentium, derived from a wording in Psalm 61:5a. All verses address God in different images, followed by the repeated request \\"wohne unter uns, unter uns\\" (dwell among us, among us). The first verse requests faith, the second love, the third hope, the cardinal virtues. The fourth verse requests the coming of God's kingdom.  Music  The melody and four-part setting were composed by Herbert Heine (born 1934). It is in D major and common time. The melody of the verses has many syncopes, suggesting free speech, while the refrain follows the regular beat. The last line of the melody, rising to the top note and returning, suggests the contour of a tent. The setting appears in the choral collection of NGL songs Vom Leben singen (Singing of Life).

The Grand Prince of Moscow Vasily the Blind released the icon with special church honors and left in Moscow its exact copy. Following the death of Metropolitan bishop of Kiev Gregory the Bulgarian in 1474, Misail became his see successor. Confirmation of Misail at the Kiev Metropolitan see by the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV Jagiellon became delayed. Delay in appointment of Misail might have been delayed according to Mykhailo Hrushevsky due to resistance of the Latin Church clergy caused by the precedent of appointing Gregory the Bulgarian to the metropolitan see by the Pope. During that time in 1476 the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople Raphael I consecrated a native of the Grand Duchy of Tver Spyridon as the Metropolitan bishop of Kiev. After arriving to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Spyridon was imprisoned by state authorities and was released only in 1482 (after the death of Misail). References External links * Mytsyk, Yu.

It was constructed connecting the country's first motorable road between Amlekhganj in the terai and Bhimphedi settlement of Makwanpur, the point of entry into Kathmandu which served as a dry port, in the trade route between Kathmandu and Raxaul. It was the country's first highway tunnel. Constructed in 1917 to reduce the travel time between the Indian border and Bhimphedi it has since fallen into disrepair. The entrance lies at the premises of the Churia (Churiya) Temple off Mahendra Highway in the outskirts of Hetauda, and efforts are ongoing to conserve the remaining structure.  History The 13th Prime Minister of Nepal Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana assigned Dilli Jung Thapa, the country's first civil engineering graduate, as project chief to construct the tunnel. The tunnel was originally constructed to reduce travel time for horse-drawn carriages and lorries traversing the distance between the Indian border and Bhimphedi. The cost to construct the tunnel is not clear; according to historians the unspent budget allocation was returned to the treasury. The tunnel has not been in use since construction of the \\"Pathlaiya-Hetauda road\\" (connecting Pathlaiya and Hetauda), and is presently unusable due to \\"decades of disuse and lack of maintenance\\". The city of Hetauda is working to conserve the tunnel, with efforts led by the Churia Mai Temple and Tunnel Conservation Committee. The chair of the committee, Prem Bomjan, while talking about the restoration, said: \\"The tunnel has been in a sorry state for a long time. People were concerned that a landslide might obliterate the whole structure if immediate steps are not taken towards its conservation\\". The Churia Tunnel was declared a site of historical importance by Hetauda Municipality. Future plans include erecting a statue of architect Dilli Jung Thapa near the site. The Nepalese Army blocked the tunnel during the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. Some parts of the tunnel collapsed during the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, but the tunnel entrance is still intact. Dilli Jung Thapa's grandson Janak Jung Thapa, while talking about the current status of Nepal, said: \\"If only Nepal's planners had seen the potential and built more tunnels like this one, the country would have seen much more rapid development\\".

He was also a significant educator of Indian students in Calcutta. Early life He was born in Brechin, the younger son of Henry William Tytler and his wife Christiana Gillies (died 1825), daughter of Robert Gillies of Little Keithock, and sister of John Gillies. When he was about seven, his father became an army surgeon, and the family moved to Guernsey. Shortly they went on to Cape Colony, where Henry William Tytler was Apothecary to the Forces. At age 12 John encountered and impressed John Barrow. In 1802 peace meant the territory reverted to its status as the Dutch Cape Colony, and the family returned to London. In London only for some months, Tytler was a pupil at an academy in Soho Square run by the Rev. William Whitelock. The family then moved to Edinburgh, where he heard lectures by John Playfair. In line with his mother's wishes, aged 14 he took a place under her brother working in commerce, in London again. His father died in 1809, and around 1812 he pursued medical studies at St Bartholomew's Hospital, retaining his job. He qualified and was nominated as an East India Company assistant surgeon. In Bengal Tytler sailed for India on in 1813, with his mother. There his sister Margaret (died 1822) joined the family household at Calcutta: she had been in Bengal for a year, with John's elder brother Robert, also a surgeon. It was Robert Tytler who engaged in an 1823 controversy as \\"Dr Tytler\\" with Ram Mohan Roy on christology. After a short period at the Calcutta General Hospital, Tytler was posted in 1814 to Patna. While there he married, to a first cousin who came out to India in 1818. He was moved to Champaran in 1819, to the disappointment of William Jack who considered Tytler an \\"Ursa Major\\". Finding life there at Mallye unhealthy, he moved on to Munger, where his sister died.A. T. Gage, I. H. Burkill and William Jack, William Jack's Letters to Nathaniel Wallich, 1819-1821, Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society No. 73 (July, 1916), pp. 147‚Äì268 at pp. 170‚Äì1. Published by: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society While in Patna, Margaret Tytler worked on local crafts, and Tytler presented a display of models to the Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art after her death.Catalogue of Industrial Department, Edinburgh Museum of Science and Art Industrial Department 1869, 114 pages, at p. 100. In 1825 Tytler, after a promotion, was attached as surgeon to the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, and in 1826 joined the unit at Barrackpore. He spent some time that year in Calcutta, and was elected to the Asiatic Society, before becoming garrison surgeon at Chunar. In 1827 he was made a presidency surgeon, meaning he resided permanently in Calcutta. He was shortly put in charge of the Education Committee press. Scholar On his own account, Tytler began to learn Arabic in 1813, a task that took him 14 years. He also began to study and edit texts on Unani medicine.Seema Alavi, Medical Culture in Transition: Mughal Gentleman Physician and the Native Doctor in Early Colonial India, Modern Asian Studies Vol. 42, No. 5 (Sep., 2008), pp. 853‚Äì897, at p. 877 and note 62. Published by: Cambridge University Press At Patna, through the senior magistrate Henry Douglas, he met Dewan Khan Ji (also Divan Kanhji), who had compiled a Persian work Khazanat ul Ilm covering European mathematics. Tytler did much to see it into print. At the end of his life, he also came into contact, via a Muslim scholar in the service of the son of Mitrajit Singh of the Tekari Raj, with another mathematical manuscript in Persian. It was named the Jamia Bahadur Khani. In 1829, Tytler became joint curator of the museum of the Asiatic Society, with the naturalist David Ross.Bernard Le Calloc'h, Un temoignage capital sur la vie d'Alexander Csoma de K≈ër√∂s: Le journal et la correspondance de Victor Jaquemont, Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae Vol. 41, No. 1 (1987), pp. 83‚Äì124, at p. 109 note 5. Published by: Akad√©miai Kiad√≥ That year he gave a paper to the Asiatic Society on a \\"universal alphabet\\" for romanization of Asian languages. On the other hand he opposed in 1833 Joseph Thomas Thompson's fully romanized Hindustani dictionary, when used by Indians. Educator In the period to 1835, Tytler was involved in the nascent educational institutions in Calcutta: the Calcutta Madrasa, the Hindoo College (officially the Sanscrit College), the Native Medical Institution. At the Hindoo College, he lectured on mathematics from 1831 to 1835. Among his mathematics pupils was Radhanath Sikdar. At this time the clash between the \\"orientalist\\" and \\"Anglicist\\" approaches to the governing of British India came to a head. Tytler was known as a committed proponent of the \\"orientalist\\" attitude in medical education, and in 1827 he took over as Superintendent of the Native Medical Institution, from Peter Breton, who died in 1830. For the Madrasa, he and Breton provided translations of European medical texts into Arabic. He advocated also that students at the Hindoo College should be able to undertake medical education. Administratively, the Bengal Presidency's educational policy was in the hands of the General Committee of Public Instruction (GCPI), set up in 1823. Up to 1833 the orientalists had a predominance there.Natalie Robinson Sirkin and Gerald Sirkin, The Battle of Indian Education: Macaulay's Opening Salvo Newly Discovered, Victorian Studies Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jun., 1971), pp. 407‚Äì428, at pp. 407‚Äì8. Published by: Indiana University Press The GCPI commissioned Tytler's translation of scientific and medical texts into Arabic and Persian. That attitude changed with the appointment to the GCPI of Charles Edward Trevelyan. The education debate and public policy By 1834, the tide seemed to be turning against the orientalists, with Tytler writing to Horace Hayman Wilson that the government line appeared to be that Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit were not of practical use. In April of that year, Trevelyan leading the Anglicists on the GCPI proposed that the Calcutta Madrasa should only admit students who would study English as well as Arabic. He was opposed by Henry Thoby Prinsep at the head of the orientalists. Thomas Babington Macaulay, recently arrived in India, intervened with his Minute on Indian Education of February 1835, backed by Lord William Bentinck who was Governor-General of India, and the Madrasa's existence was under threat. Tytler in January 1835 had a meeting with Macaulay to discuss the latter's Anglicist position, followed up by an exchange of letters, to no avail.Natalie Robinson Sirkin and Gerald Sirkin, The Battle of Indian Education: Macaulay's Opening Salvo Newly Discovered, Victorian Studies Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jun., 1971), pp. 407‚Äì428, at pp. 420‚Äì1. Published by: Indiana University Press Bentinck's objective was simpler and cheaper administration, that avoided the use of Persian, and on the advice of Samuel Ford Whittingham he had allowed Macaulay to take the public lead on the education issue. The Native Medical Institution was closed down, as Tytler learned shortly before leaving on a planned journey to the Cape of Good Hope. On the GCPI, James Charles Colebrooke Sutherland, identified as \\"orientalist\\", had joined those condemning Tytler's teaching style, and H. T. Prinsep did not pursue an absolute line in favour of Arabic and Sanskrit; while Henry Shakespear had supported John Russell Colvin's view that English should be compulsory in the Madrasa.Natalie Robinson Sirkin and Gerald Sirkin, The Battle of Indian Education: Macaulay's Opening Salvo Newly Discovered, Victorian Studies Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jun., 1971), pp. 407‚Äì428, at p. 416.

Published by: Indiana University Press The medical classes at the Madrasa and Hindoo College were also stopped. The replacement was the New Medical College.s:Advice to Officers in India/Chapter 1 When Tytler applied to become its Superintendent, his view that English should not be the sole language of instruction made that impossible. The Calcutta Medical College, as it became known, did otherwise retain continuities with the old institution. Its first head was Mountford Joseph Bramley (1803‚Äì1837). Last years and aftermath In 1835 Tytler took his family back to London. After a year they moved on again, to Jersey, where he died in 1837. A lengthy obituary notice appeared in the May 1837 issue of the Asiatic Journal; it was unsigned, but it is known that the author was Horace Hayman Wilson.Natalie Robinson Sirkin and Gerald Sirkin, The Battle of Indian Education: Macaulay's Opening Salvo Newly Discovered, Victorian Studies Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jun., 1971), pp. 407‚Äì428, at p. 413 note 23.

It was the parish church of the royal Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. Location The church is located at the crossing of Boulevard Henri-Barbusse, Rue Franklin and Rue de l'√âglise in the commune of Montreuil just east of Paris. The chevet is located at 2, Rue de Romainville. History The parish of Montreuil was probably already formed in the Merovingian period as shown by the presence of a small monastery on a hill that overlooked Vincennes.. The city of Montreuil probably derives its name from the Latin word monasteriolum (\\"small monastery\\"). In the 8th century, a royal decree testified the presence of a church on the site on the feast day of Sts. Peter and Paul (29 June). The current building replaced an earlier Romanesque church. The oldest part of the building is the choir from the late 12th and early 13th centuries. It was built by Louis IX (later Saint Louis) and is similar to the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris. St. Peter and St. Paul was the parish church of the royal Ch√¢teau de Vincennes and was therefore attended and maintained by members of the French royal family between the 13th and the 16th centuries, which enabled the residents of Montreuil to pay fewer taxes. The church usually drew the royal family for Sunday and Easter services. At this time, Louis IX and his mother Blanche of Castile frequently attended religious services there. King Charles V and his future spouse Joanna of Bourbon were baptised together at St. Peter and St. Paul in 1375. In the 16th century, the royal family moved to the Palace of Fontainebleau and the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain and no longer attended the church of Montreuil regularly. However, it made donations for St. Peter and St. Paul until Notre-Dame de la Pissote became a parish church in Vincennes in the mid-17th century. The central part of the fa√ßade was built in the 14th century, while the fa√ßade of an aisle was erected in the 15th century. The bell tower was built in the 14th and 15th centuries, with an interruption during the Hundred Years War. The great nave and the first three bays date back to the 15th century, while the side aisles with the baptismal font were added in the 18th century. In the 19th century, the bell tower was restored after its spire was destroyed by lightning in 1808. The church was completed in the 19th century with the construction of the chapel of Sainte-Genevi√®ve. St. Peter and St. Paul was listed as a Class Historic Monument in 1913. By the end of the 20th-century and the early 21st-century, the church was highly deteriorated. The ceiling collapsed several times and the keystone of the nave broke away in 1986, which caused the church to be closed by 1993. After further restoration works that cost nearly ‚Ç¨1,9 million, the renovated choir was inaugurated on March 10, 2007. Architecture The church has a rectangular base, with a flat chevet and no transept. The triforium is characteristic of the early 13th-century Gothic style. Its arch frames three ribs in each bay. Around 1980, tombs were excavated in front of the fa√ßade of the church. Numerous small stakes reinforce the foundations of the church. The chevet wall is adorned with two wooden statues of Saints Peter and Paul topped by four bas-reliefs showing the Four Evangelists. A brass cross made by Jacques Dieudonn√© stands in the center.

The English ambassador's masque would have comprised: six dancers wearing swords or falchions with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets. Only the account for making the costumes is known, and the subject of the masque was not recorded.Henry Morley, Masques and Entertainments by Ben Jonson (London, 1890), pp. xii-xiii: James Robinson Planche, A Cyclopedia Of Costume, vol. 2 (London, 1879), p. 394: John Payne Collier, Annals of the Stage, vol. 1 (London, 1831), pp. 270-1, citing British Library Lansdowne MS 59. On 15 September the resident ambassador in Edinburgh William Ashby mentioned the \\"great preparation\\" in Leith to receive the queen. This included a covered walkway called a \\"trance\\" from the quayside steps to the King's Wark where there was a temporary wooden stair, platform, and entry into the Queen's Lodging on the first floor. These structures and the pathway would be covered with Turkish carpets and tapestry. At this time the scaffolding was usually secured in old barrels filled with sand.See example in Henry Paton, Accounts of the Masters of Work, vol. 1 (HMSO: Edinburgh, 1957). Old barrels were also used to form washing tubs for linen cloths and clothes. The ceremony of the welcoming speeches and the king's response in the Queen's Hall was planned in detail. The Earl of Bothwell, Lord Seton, and Sir Robert Melville were to board her ship with Peter Young to make a speech of welcome in Latin. On the shore of Leith she would be met by the Countess of Mar, with Lady Seton, Lady Boyne, Lady Thirlestane, and Lady Dudhope. James Elphinstone would make a speech on the scaffold at the King's Wark.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 186. After the king left Anne in the lodging and went to give thanks for his return in South Leith Parish Church the stair would be dismantled. The plan was for Anne to stay in the lodging at Leith for 12 days until the \\"solemnity\\" of her entry and coronation.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 150, 154-155: Thomson, Thomas, ed., David Calderwood's History of Kirk of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 60‚Äì64, 94: Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI (Edinburgh, 1828) pp. 37-8.

Arrival at Leith Anne of Denmark travelled in her silver coach from Leith to Holyrood Palace Anne was crowned in Holyrood Abbey, (Louis Daguerre) James VI sent instructions for his welcome with the master of work William Schaw, who was to repair the Palace of Holyroodhouse. James VI sent a list of who should form the welcoming party at Leith, and the food and drink required to entertain his Danish guests.Grant G. Simpson, 'Personal Letters of James VI', Julian Goodare & Michael Lynch, The Reign of James VI (Tuckwell: East Linton, 2000), pp. 150-153: Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 41-2, citing British Library Cotton Caligula D.1 ff.435-7 (contemporary copy).

Saddles and mantles were to be provided for riders in the procession from Leith to Holyroodhouse.Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI (Edinburgh, 1828), pp. 29-34. James VI sent orders that John Carmichael should raise a company of 200 soldiers to attend his landing, and restrain those trying to meet him at Leith, including \\"nobility and ladies\\". This was disappointing news which led to fears that the \\"order used in Denmark\\", where noble titles were not used, might prejudice their ancient rights.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 285. Carmichael's instructions for the welcome also requested fireworks and the Flemish sugarman, Jacques de Bousie, was to prepare confections and sweetmeats for banquets at the landing. The Countess of Mar and Lady Thirlestane were to organise a welcoming party of noble ladies and young gentlewomen.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 261-2.

The King led, riding with his earls, the queen riding behind in a coach shipped from Denmark, accompanied by the three Scottish earls chosen as companions to the Danish envoys.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 101. Edinburgh town had made plans for a bonfire on the side of Calton Hill for this procession.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Ediburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 4.. Above all, the Danish coach drew the onlooker's attention, \\"richly apparelled with cloth of gold and purple velvet\\", and said to be all silver with \\"no iron in it.\\"Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590-1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (August, 2019), p. 166.

The dates of these events were swapped to avoid festivities on a Sunday.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10, (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 293, 295. The Danish ambassadors requested permission to use the time before the coronation to view and take sasine of the lands and palaces given to Anne of Denmark by James VI as a \\"morning gift\\". Peder Munk and the lawyer John Skene made this journey between 11 and 14 May.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding(Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 100-101, 103.

They visited Falkland Palace, Linlithgow Palace and Dunfermline Palace. The English ambassador Robert Bowes heard the Danish commission was dissatisfied with the value of the lands and the state of the buildings, and they insisted the queen should have as good a settlement as that given by James IV to Margaret Tudor in 1503.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 295-6. The Coronation The Coronation took place on Sunday 17 May 1590 in Holyrood Abbey.

Robert Bruce was the minister. William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus carried the sword of state into the church, Lord Hamilton the sceptre, and the Duke of Lennox carried the king's crown.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 104. James VI entered the church with five earls walking behind holding the tails of his purple cloak. John Maitland, newly made Lord Crichton followed with the queen's crown. Anna was next, with the English ambassador Robert Bowes at her right hand, and the Danish admiral Peder Munk at her left. Eleanor Musgrave, Bowes's wife, and three Scottish countesses held the queen's train; Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar, Margaret Douglas, Countess of Bothwell and Jean Kennedy, Countess of Orkney. Behind them walked Jean Fleming, Lady Chancellor, Margaret Livingstone, Lady Justice Clerk, and other women. The maidens of honour followed, including Cathrina Skinkel and Anna Kaas. When the congregation was settled in their places, Psalm 40 and Psalm 48 were sung, and there was a sermon.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 104-105. Robert Bruce gave a short speech explaining that the anointing and other rituals were civil matters and not eccelesiatical.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 104: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10, (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 104-5. Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar adjusted the queen's clothing to expose her shoulder and upper right arm, and Bruce anointed her with oil. Some ministers of the Scottish kirk considered the anointing of the queen to be idolatrous.Clare McManus, Women on the Renaissance Stage (Manchester, 2002, pp. 70-1. The queen then changed out off her clothes into royal robes in a curtained-off enclosure or tent in the church, assisted by Cathrina Skinkel and Anna Kaas.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 104-7. The robe was made of purple velvet lined with white Spanish taffeta, fastened with one great gold button, with a purple velvet stomacher tied with white ribbon. There was a band of gold passements around the gown and a narrower band at the neck, and a fur trim or fur lapels.Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI (Edinburgh, 1828), Appendix pp. 13-14: National Records of Scotland E21/105 (duplicate account) pp. 408-409. Thus transformed, she returned to her seat and Bruce placed the crown on her head. James passed the sceptre to Bruce who gave it to the queen. Bruce acknowledged her as \\"our most gracious lady and queen of Scotland\\" in Scots, and David Lindsay, the minister who had married them, repeated the speech in French, which she knew better. She read out her oath, to support God's work, justice, and the church. Bruce called on the congregation to pray that the queen would work to achieve as she had made her oath. Then the cry went up, \\"May Our Lord and God protect and keep the queen\\", and the queen moved to a throne placed higher on the stage between the Duke of Lennox and Lord Hamilton. Andrew Melville recited his Latin poem, the Stephaniskion; Bruce spoke on the great benefits the marriage had brought, and asked the people to pay homage. An oath to serve the queen was made on behalf of the people of Scotland.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 104-7. =A crown of Scotland for the queen= The queen's crown was described in two later inventories of royal jewels. It was an imperial crown with arches surmounted by a ball set with pearls and a cross with diamonds, pearls, and a ruby. The main stones of the circlet were a large sapphire and a diamond, a ruby, with 24 pearls.Diana Scarisbrick, 'Anne of Denmark's Jewellery Inventory', Archaeologia, 109 (1991), p. 207: TNA SP 16/8/64, I, f. 106. The crown was fitted with a purple velvet bonnet lined with crimson satin.Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI (Edinburgh, 1828) p. 13 This may have been a crown made from Scottish gold for Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, in October 1539 by the Edinburgh goldsmith John Mosman.Andrea Thomas, Glory and Honour: The Renaissance in Scotland (Edinburgh, 2013), p. 187: James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 254.

The town gate was decorated with tapestry and above the roadway there was a platform for musicians. A globe was lowered to the queen's coach; it opened to reveal a boy dressed in red velvet with a white taffeta cloak. He gave the queen a Bible, a key to the city, and a jewel, while reciting a verse. The globe, which had been borrowed from Dundee, closed up and was winched up again. The boy represented \\"Edina\\", the female embodiment of Edinburgh. The Bible was bought from Nicoll Uddart, bound in gilt Morocco leather, and presented in a pocket made of purple velvet supplied by Robert Jousie.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 108, 144. =The Convoy= As part of the ceremony, when Anne of Denmark was in the town, fifty people walked in front of her coach, to make way through the crowds. Some wore masks of the colour of the base matals: lead, copper, or iron. Some had blackened their faces and arms, others had black sleeves and gloves, and they wore black ankle boots with white buskins or leggings on their calves. These were young men from Edinburgh representing African people, described at the time as \\"Moors\\". The leader of this group was an African man holding a sword, while his followers had long white staffs to make room. Some wore costumes like sailors' tunics of white taffeta or silver cloth, and gold necklaces, and wore gold links set with precious stones at their noses and ears or mouths. They wore short trousers and had blackened their legs to the thigh. The painting and make-up cost 42 shillings.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 332. Their performance included walking stiffly, or half in dance, with high steps like a stork in water, staggering as if drunk, or crouching forwards as they passed.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 108: P.

The poet John Burell described the variety of precious stones worn by the \\"Moirs\\" in nineteen stanzas of verse. According to Burrell, these men represented the \\"Moirs\\" of \\"the Inds\\" who lived in comparative ease and comfort by the golden mountain of \\"Synerdas\\" and came to honour the queen in Edinburgh, unlike the followers of Faunus who scratched a living in the wilderness; > \\"Thir are the MOIRS, of quhom I mene, > Quha dois inhabit in the ynds: > Leving thair land and dwelling place, > For to do honour to hir Grace. > Thay have na scant, nor indigence, > Quhair thay do dwell, and have exces, > Nor yit thay have na residence, > With PHAUNUS, God of wildernes: > Bot thay do dwell, quhair thay were wont, > Beside SYNERDAS goldin mont.\\"Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI > (Edinburgh, 1828), 'Discription', pp. v-vi.: 'THE DISCRIPTION OF THE QVEENS > MAIESTIES MAIST HONORABLE ENTRY INTO THE TOVN OF EDINBVRGH, VPON THE 19.

They were called the \\"convoy\\".Thomas Thomson, Diurnal of Occurrents (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 67: Documents relative to the reception at Edinburgh of the Kings and Queens of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1822), p. 7. An African man described as the \\"Moir\\" was a member of Anne of Denmark's household in October 1590 and was bought clothes with the queen's pages, although it not known if this was the same person as the leader of the \\"moors\\" at the Entry.Papers Relative to the Marriage of James VI (Edinburgh, 1828), Appendix, pp. 21, 28, 36. The African servant in the queen's household is not recorded in later years and may have died in 1591. In 1594 an African actor took part in the masque at the baptism of Prince Henry, and he may have been the performer at the 1590 Entry.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 144. =The Horoscope= Anna progressed in her coach under a canopy called the \\"paill\\" up the narrow street from the Grassmarket called the West Bow, where a boy with mathematical instruments played the female personification of Astronomy, \\"Astronomia\\" or \\"Astrologia\\", reciting Anne's fortune and the children she would bear in Latin verse composed by the schoolmaster Hercules Rollock. The actor predicted a hail storm and white sugar sweets were thrown from the windows of houses overlooking the scene, near Riddle's Court. The child said this rain would fall into her lap, proving the truth of his prediction, alluding to the legend of Dana√´.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 110, 145. The 12 boxes of sweets, described as \\"scrotcherts and confects\\", cost ¬£3-2s-8d Scots.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 331. Anna's canopy was carried by six men, three teams were appointed to serve in stages through the streets of Edinburgh.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 5. =The Muses= At the top of the street on the Royal Mile there was a weigh house for butter, called the \\"Butter Tron\\".Daniel Wilson, Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 114. There nine young women from Edinburgh were dressed as the Muses. They had elaborate costumes, and held gilt books. John Burrell described the costume in verse. They curtsied, and sang, but did not speak; instead another schoolboy spoke for them in verse, explaining to Anne that the muses served the king and she would be their refuge and mother.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 111, 145. The Netherbow or East Port gate of Edinburgh =The Virtues= Outside St Giles Kirk there was a large stage, on which stood the mother Virtue or Piety crowned with her four daughters dressed in black silk with chaplets of flowers on their head. Virtue took off her crown and gave it to the queen. Virtue's speech exhorted Anne to welcome her daughters, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and Temperance into her home where they would watch over her. Each daughter then came forward, Prudence with an astrolabe in her hand, who counselled against the laziness that brings misfortune; Justice, with her sword and scales, explained that strong castles are built on the principle of equity; Fortitude, with the club of Hercules and a shield, advised humility in success and patience in failure to disregard sorrow. Temperance, with her hourglass and bridle, counselled self-control. Mother Virtue concluded that the Word of God was the greatest wealth. Then Psalm 120 was sung.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 112-114. The five actors were young men dressed as women. Another account of the event says they held the usual traditional attributes, Prudence a serpent and dove, Fortitude a broken pillar, and Temperance a cup of wine. This discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that the performance involved the virtues picking up these alternative objects.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 146. =Banquet of Bacchus and Ceres= Anne of Denmark got out of her coach and walked into St Giles under the red velvet canopy or \\"paill\\" flanked by Peder Munk and Lord Hamilton, while a choir sang Psalm 19. Robert Bruce preached on the subject of Psalm 107, a reflection of thanksgiving for the safe return of mariners; then Psalm 23 was sung. Outside the church, where the Mercat Cross is now situated, the next pageant showed the ancestry of the kings of Denmark and the arms of previous Scottish queen consorts. Nearby were Bacchus and Ceres, played by schoolboys, offering a banquet referring to the abundance of the lands of the queen's \\"morning gift\\". A big older actor, who had been seated on a wine barrel, got up and threw food gifts into the crowd of spectators.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 114-5, 146. =The Family Tree= At the place where salt was weighed, the \\"Salt Tron\\", where the Tron Kirk is now, an artificial tree had five stages or branches with boys representing kings and queens with the arms of the monarchs of Denmark and Scotland. At the base of the tree a king in armour resting on a couch was Christian I of Denmark, a common ancestor of James VI and Anne, from whom these monarchs descended, as the Biblical kings sprang from Jesse. For Anne's benefit, a boy rehearsed her family tree.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 115-7, 146. =Solomon and the Queen of Sheba= The final pageant of the Entry took place at the East Port or Netherbow, the gate on the Royal Mile to the Canongate that leads to Holyroodhouse. A dialogue between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was dramatised. The queen said she had come to Solomon to study his unequalled wisdom. She brought him the balsam that does not grow in Scotland, and thanked him for his company which was like drinking at Pallas Athena's breast. Solomon replied that she should always remain in his respect and honour, and so good-night. Then another schoolboy explained to Anne of Denmark that as the Queen of Sheba had desired to meet Solomon, so James had travelled to meet her, and now all Scotland would serve her. He gave Anne of Denmark the town's gift of a jewel, which was lowered from the Netherbow with a length of silk ribbon.David Stevenson, Scotland's Last Royal Wedding (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 117-120, 148. Anne returned down the Canongate to Holyroodhouse, according to John Burrell, still accompanied by the 40 or 50 young men in costume as \\"moors\\". Adrian Damman explains that at Holyrood they tied bronze bells to the white buskins or shanks they wore on their lower legs, and began to dance, in contrast to their slow processional walk, as if they were Corybants followers of the goddess Cybele.Adriam Damman, 'De Introitu Reg. Annae in Edinburgam' (Edinburgh, 1590). =The Jewel= The town of Edinburgh had obtained a royal jewel in security for a loan of ¬£6,000 Scots to the king in 1584, a locket set with a diamond and emerald.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 310-12. In October 1589 the Provost John Arnot cancelled the loan and gave the jewel back to the king as a gift as a marriage gift.David Masson, Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland: 1585-1592, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), p. 420. The jewel had remained in the family of a previous Provost, Alexander Clerk, and was delivered to William Fairlie, who commissioned the goldsmith David Gilbert to remake and enlarge it as a gift to present to the queen.Marguerite Wood, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 4, 7, 20: Daniel Wilson, Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 113. It is sometimes said the purpose of the original loan had to been to finance ambassadors sent to England to plead for the life of Mary, Queen of Scots, but that loan seems to be a different transaction, for ¬£4,000.John Marwick, Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1573-1589 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 478. David Calderwood said the jewel was called the \\"A\\", probably referring to the crowned initial or cipher of \\"A\\" on its case.Daniel Wilson, Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 115: David Calderwood, History of the Kirk, vol. 5, p. 97: Maureen M.

Hercules Rollock was the schoolmaster of Edinburgh High School. He was credited with writing the verses on astrology and good fortune, which survive only in a Danish translation, and he would have been involved in writing, planning and rehearsing the Entry, which featured his pupils as pageant actors. His poem on the marriage De avgvstissimo Iacobi 6. Scotorum Regis, & Ann√¶ Frederici 2. had been published in 1589.Steven Reid, 'Murder, Mayhem and the Muse in Jacobean Edinburgh: introducing Hercules Rollock (c. 1546-1599)'.: David Stevenson (1997), p. 110: See external links.

He died in a car crash on July 19, 1966 in Pretoria. After schooling in Pretoria and Cape Town, he enrolled in 1922 to earn a degree in architecture at the University of the Witwatersrand. There he met architect Gordon Leith, with whom he apprenticed from 1922 to 1930 while completing his studies. Leith hired Eaton as director of his Pretoria office in 1926. Eaton was awarded a nine-month residency at the British School at Rome in 1929 and then visited various European countries in 1930 and 1931. He founded his own firm on his return to South Africa in 1933. He specialized in unpainted brick houses with African elements, including motifs reminiscent of Great Zimbabwe. Later designs also incorporated aspects of ancient Egyptian architecture as well. His houses emphasized regionalism through the use of local material and forms, including small windows, awnings, and eaves adapted to the warm climate; traditional wooden shutters; and large patches of earth-tone paved stone. In 1940, he earned his first major commercial commission, the Land Bank in Potchefstroom. That same year, he entered a partnership with Alan Fair that continued until 1945. In 1945, he traveled to the United States, Argentina, and Brazil as well as parts of southern and central Africa. On his return, he was invited to restore the Reinet House in Graaff-Reinet. Among his best-known works are the Greenwood House, the Nedbank building on Church Street, Polley's Arcade, and the Little Theatre Unisa (all in Pretoria) as well as the Nedbank Building on Smith Street in Durban. His other designs for Landbank buildings include those in Potchefstroom, Pietermaritzburg, and Kroonstad. Recognition and awards In 1960, the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns awarded Eaton its Gold Medal. Several artists and architects, including Alexis Preller, expressed their praise of him at a memorial service a year and a half after his death. In 1968, the South African Institute of Architects posthumously awarded him their Gold Medal.

Italians, W√ºrttemberg, Westphalian, Hessian were no less active in the sack of Moscow. Relatively high levels of discipline were distinguished by Poles, Bavarians, Saxons. under French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte lasted a little more than a month, from September 14 to October 19, 1812, and became a turning point in the French invasion of Russia. During the occupation, the city was looted and devastated by fire, the causes of which are controversial among historians. The last time before this, Moscow was occupied by foreign troops exactly 200 years before. Background After the Battle of Borodino, in which the Russian Army suffered heavy losses, Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov ordered on September 8, 1812, to retreat from Moscow to Mozhaysk with the firm intention to save the army. On the afternoon of September 13, 1812, a military council was held in the village of Fili, near Moscow, on a plan for further action. Despite the fact that the majority of generals, primarily General Levin August von Bennigsen, spoke out in favor of giving Napoleon a new general battle near the walls of Moscow, Kutuzov, on the basis of the main task of preserving the army, interrupted the meeting of the military council and ordered to retreat, surrendering Moscow to the French. Having estimated the difficult and dangerous situation of the Russian army stretched across Moscow, burdened with a large number of wounded and numerous convoys, and also not having the ability to hold the enemy for a long time on its approaches, the commander of the Russian rearguard General Mikhail Miloradovich decided to enter into negotiations with the commander of the French vanguard, Marshal Joachim Murat. To this end, Miloradovich sent to Murat the captain of the Life Guards of the Hussar Regiment, Fyodor Akinfov, with a note signed by the duty general of the General Staff of the Russian Army, Colonel Paisiy Kaysarov, which said: \\"The wounded left in Moscow are entrusted to the humanity of the French troops\\". In words, Miloradovich ordered on his behalf to convey to Murat that Akinfov's task also included staying in the enemy's camp for as long as possible to gain time. On the morning of September 14, Akinfov, with a trumpeter from Miloradovich's convoy, drove up to the enemy forward chain just at the time when the shooting had resumed and Murat had already ordered his cavalry to attack the Russian positions. Colonel of the 1st Horse-Jaeger Regiment, Cl√©ment Louis Elyon de Villeneuve, who went into the chain at the signal of a trumpeter, sent Akinfov to the commander of the II Cavalry Corps, General Horace Fran√ßois Bastien S√©bastiani. The latter himself proposed to transmit the letter to Murat, but Akinfov said that he was instructed not only to personally deliver the letter to the Neapolitan King, but also to convey something to him in words. Then Sebastiani nevertheless ordered to send the Russian parliamentarians to Murat. After reading the note, Murat objected: \\"In vain to entrust the sick and wounded to the generosity of the French troops; the French in captive enemies no longer see enemies\\". In response to the demand of Miloradovich, he said that the offensive could be stopped only after the appropriate order of Napoleon himself, after which he instructed his adjutant to conduct Akinfov to the French emperor. However, when Akinfov and the trumpeter traveled about 200 steps, Murat unexpectedly ordered the Russian parliamentarians to be returned and told Akinfov that \\"wanting to save Moscow\\" he would accept Miloradovich's conditions and would advance \\"as quietly\\" as the Russians, but with the condition that French troops could take the city on the same day. In addition, during the dialogue, Murat asked Akinfov, as a native of Moscow, to persuade the residents of the city to remain calm, ensuring that they would not be harmed and not taken the slightest indemnity. The Great Army began to enter Moscow on September 14 in the afternoon, essentially following the heels of the Russian army leaving it. It happened that cavalry from the French vanguard mixed with the Cossacks of the Russian rearguard, while not only not showing hostile relations to each other, but also sometimes showing mutual respect. Entrance of the French to Moscow Before Moscow waiting for the Boyars' Deputation, by Vasily Vereshchagin On September 14, 1812, at 2 pm on Tuesday, Napoleon arrived at Poklonnaya Gora, which was 3 miles away from Moscow (within its borders for 1812).The official of the Russian Ministry of Finance, Fyodor Korbeletsky, who was captured by the French on August 30 and was at Napoleon's main headquarters for 3 weeks, left detailed notes on what was happening during this period. Notes by Korbeletsky \\"A Brief Narrative About the French Invasion of Moscow and Their Stay in It. With the Appendix of an Ode in Honor of the Victorious Russian Army\\" were published in Saint Petersburg in 1813. There, by Murat's order, the vanguard of the French troops were formed into battle formation. Here Napoleon waited for half an hour, and then, not seeing any enemy action from Moscow, ordered a shot from a cannon to give a signal to the further movement of the French troops to Moscow. Cavalry and artillery on horses galloped at full speed, and the infantry ran. After reaching about a quarter-hour of the Dorogomilovskaya outpost, Napoleon dismounted at the Kamer-Kollezhsky shaft and began to pace back and forth, waiting for a delegation or bringing of city keys from Moscow. Infantry and artillery to the music began to enter the city. After about ten minutes of waiting, a young man in a blue overcoat and a round hat approached Napoleon and, after talking with Napoleon for a few minutes, entered the outpost. According to an eyewitness Fyodor Korbaletsky, this young man told the French emperor that the Russian army and residents left the city. This news, spread among the French, at first aroused bewilderment in them, which over time grew into despondency and grief. Napoleon was out of balance. At that time, suitable French troops began to split before approaching the Dorogomilovskaya outpost into two parts and bypass Moscow along the Kamer-Kollezhsky shaft to the right and left to enter the city through other outposts. An hour later, having regained consciousness, Napoleon mounted his horse and rode into Moscow. He was followed by cavalry, which had not entered Moscow before. Having passed the Dorogomilovskaya Yamskaya Sloboda and reaching the banks of the Moscow River, Napoleon stopped. At this time, the vanguard crossed the Moscow River, infantry and artillery began to cross the river over the bridge, and the cavalry began to ford. After crossing the river, the army began to break up into small detachments, taking guard on the river bank, along the main streets and side streets of the city. The entry of the French into Moscow The streets of the city were deserted. In front of Napoleon, at a distance of a hundred fathoms, two squadrons of horse guards rode. The retinue of Napoleon was very numerous. The difference between the diversity and richness of the decoration of the uniforms of the people surrounding Napoleon and the simplicity of the decoration of the uniform of the emperor himself was striking. On Arbat Street, Napoleon saw only the owner of the pharmacy with his family and the wounded French general, who was at their stand. Having reached the Borovitsky gate of the Kremlin, Napoleon, looking at the Kremlin walls, said with a sneer: \\"What a scary wall!\\".The Son of the Fatherland, a Historical and Political Journal. Part Seven. Saint Petersburg, in the Printing House of Friedrich Drechsler, 1813. Page 109 General Armand de Caulaincourt, who was with the emperor, wrote: Subsequently, as the contemporaries of those events wrote, seeing both the Russian government and the Russian people hatred and self-neglect, who decided to better cede their ancient capital to him than to bow before him, Napoleon ordered that instead of horses, Russians of both sexes should be used to bring edibles to the Kremlin, not analyzing either state or years.Napoleon in Russia Through the Eyes of Russians. Moscow: Zakharov, 2004. Page 161 According to historian Alexander Martin, Muscovites in general, however, chose not to accept the occupation, but to flee the city. By the beginning of 1812, according to police, there were 270,184 residents in Moscow. According to her report, during the occupation, only about 6,200 civilians remained in the capital, that is, 2.3% of the pre-war population of the city. According to Vladimir Zemtsov, in occupied Moscow there were more than 10 thousand inhabitants. In addition, from 10 to 15 thousand Russian wounded and sick soldiers remained in it. During the occupation, cases of looting by the French army and the local population became more frequent, first caused by a desire to profit (in particular, servants and serfs robbed landlords' homes), and subsequently by a desire to survive in hunger. There were killings by the military of the civilian population. There was practically no rape, since the Muscovites who remained in the city, suffering from hunger, lack of housing and an atmosphere of violence, mostly made contact with the military voluntarily. Actually, the French were often considered by the local population as the least prone to drunkenness and robbery part of the Napoleonic army, in contrast to representatives of other ethnic groups. According to some Muscovites, the French command tried to combat violations of army discipline, although it did not succeed. However, under the influence of government propaganda, which depicted the French as godless, and the news of the desecration of local shrines, the local population sometimes called the French \\"pagans\\" or even \\"basurmans\\".See also the section Sacrilege Moscow Fire Zamoskvorechye in fire, by Vasily Vereshchagin When the French entered Moscow on September 14, 1812, arson was carried out in different places of the city.Vladimir Zemtsov. Napoleon and the Fire of Moscow The French were sure that Moscow was set on fire by order of the Moscow governor ‚Äì Count Fyodor Rostopchin. On the night of September 15 to 16, a strong wind rose, continuing, without weakening, for more than a day. The flames of fire swept the center near the Kremlin, Zamoskvorechye, Solyanka, and almost simultaneously at the most distant places of the city. The fireThere are several versions of the fire ‚Äì organized arson when leaving the city (usually associated with the name of Fyodor Rostopchin), arson by Russian scouts (several Russians were shot by the French on such a charge), uncontrolled actions by the invaders, a random fire that spread due to the general chaos in the abandoned city. There were several pockets of fire, so it is possible that all versions are true to one degree or another. raged until September 18 and destroyed most of Moscow. Up to 400 citizens from the lower classes were shot by a French military court on suspicion of arson. The fire caused Napoleon to have a gloomy impression. According to an eyewitness,Fire in Moscow he said: \\"What a terrible sight! It is they themselves! So many palaces! What an incredible solution! What kind of people! These are Scythians!\\". By the night of September 16, the fire intensified so much that Napoleon was forced to leave the Kremlin early in the morning of September 16, having moved to the Petrovsky Palace. Count S√©gur wrote: Napoleon and his entourage drove along the burning Arbat to the Moscow River, then, as Historian Yevgeny Tarle writes, he moved along a relatively safe route along its shore. Napoleon's stay in Moscow Napoleon's return to the Kremlin from the Peter's Palace On September 18, Napoleon returned to the Kremlin. From Moscow, he continued to manage his empire: he signed decrees, appointments, movements, awards, and the dismissal of officials and dignitaries. After his return to the Kremlin, the French emperor made the decision, which he announced publicly, to remain in the winter apartments in Moscow, which, as he believed at that time, even in its current state would give him more adapted buildings, more resources and more money, than any other place. He ordered, in accordance with this, to bring the Kremlin and the monasteries surrounding the city into a condition suitable for defense, and also ordered reconnaissance of the surroundings of Moscow to develop a defense system in winter. To manage the city in the house of Chancellor Nikolai Rumyantsev on Maroseyka 17, a self-government body was opened ‚Äì the Moscow municipality. Quartermaster Lesseps instructed the local merchant Dulong to select his members from among those remaining in the city of philistinism and merchants. During the 30 days of its activity, a municipality of 25 people was searching for food in the vicinity of the city, helping the poor, saving burning churches. Since the members of the municipality worked in it involuntarily, after Napoleon left the city, almost none of them were punished for collaboration. To ensure order in the city on October 12, 1812, the French created a municipal police. Execution of Moscow arsonists by French troops Napoleon himself almost daily traveled around various parts of the city and visited the monasteries surrounding it. Including Napoleon visited the Moscow Orphanage and talked with the head of the orphanage, Major General Tutolmin. At the request of Tutolmin for permission to write a report on the condition of the pupils to the Empress Maria, Napoleon not only allowed, but suddenly added: \\"I ask you to write to Emperor Alexander, whom I respect as before, that I want peace\\". On the same day, September 18, Napoleon ordered the official of the Orphanage to go through the French guard posts, with whom Tutolmin sent his report to Saint Petersburg. In total, Napoleon made three attempts to inform the king about his peace intentions, but never received an answer to them. In particular, he tried to convey such an offer through the wealthy Russian landowner Ivan Yakovlev, father of Alexander Herzen, who was forced to stay in Moscow with his young son and his mother during the occupation of Moscow by Napoleon. Napoleon made his last attempt on October 4, when he sent to Kutuzov's camp (in Tarutino) General Jacques Lauriston, who was the ambassador to Russia before the war.Kutuzov received Loriston at headquarters, refused to negotiate peace or armistice with him, and only promised to bring Alexander's proposal to Napoleon. But, as it is known, Alexander I also ignored this proposal of Napoleon. Some Soviet historians (for example, Tarle) believed that Napoleon cherished plans for liberating the peasants from serfdom as the last resort to the Russian tsar, which the Russian nobility was most afraid of;The rationale is that Napoleon intended to look for information about Pugachev in the Moscow archive, asked to sketch the manifesto for the peasantry, wrote to Evgeny Bogarne, that it would be nice to cause an uprising of peasants. the occupation itself caused a certain undermining of the established social structure (there are cases when serfs declared to their landlords, especially those who were about to flee, that they no longer consider themselves bound by their obligations). Sacrilege Stable in the Assumption Cathedral During their stay in Moscow, the French did not particularly stand on ceremony with Russian shrines; stables were set up in a number of churches. As stoves were heated with window frames, bird nests were twisted under the ceiling of buildings. In some churches, melting furnaces were set up for the smelting of gold and silver utensils.Sergey Teplyakov. \\"Moscow in 1812\\" After the Russians returned, the Assumption Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin had to be sealed so that the crowd could not see what was done inside outrage: Another memoirist notes that rumors about the blasphemous actions of the French in relation to Orthodox shrines were exaggerated by rumors, because \\"most of the cathedrals, monasteries and churches were turned into guard barracks\\" and \\"no one was allowed to enter the Kremlin under Napoleon\\".Alexander Shakhovskoy. The First Days in Burnt Moscow. September and October 1812. According to the Notes of Prince Alexander Shakhovsky // Fire of Moscow. According to the Memoirs and Notes of Contemporaries: Part 2 ‚Äì Moscow: Education, 1911. Pages 95, 99Of course, the guards did not keep order in the temples. According to Shakhovsky's recollections, \\"wine flowing out of broken barrels was dirty in the Archangel's Cathedral, junk was thrown out of the palaces and the Armory, among other things, two naked stuffed animals representing old armor\\". The most revered shrines were hidden before leaving the city: \\"In the Miracle Monastery there were no crayfish of Saint Alexei, it was taken out and hidden by Russian piety, as well as the relics of Saint Tsarevich Demetrius, and I found only one cotton paper in the tomb\\". Alexander Shakhovskoy cites the only case of a deliberate insult to the feelings of Orthodox believers: \\"a dead horse was dragged into the altar of the Kazan Cathedral and put in place of the thrown throne\\". Abandonment of Moscow by Napoleon Marshal Louis- Nicolas Davout's apartment in Chudov Monastery On October 18, 1812, Napoleon realized the futility of concluding peace agreements with the Russians and the impossibility of providing food for the French troops stationed in Moscow and the surrounding area, as a result of actively opposing attempts to establish supplies to the French army both from the Russian army and from the civilian population. After that, Napoleon decided to leave Moscow. To make such a decision, the French emperor was also prompted by sharply worsened weather with early frosts. The reasons why Napoleon abandoned his initial plans to spend the winter in Moscow are controversial among historians. In addition to problems with foraging and warm clothing, the emperor was disturbed by looting and drunkenness of the army, its general decomposition in the absence of real combat prospects. In this state, he could not lead his army to the Russian capital of Saint Petersburg. On October 18, part of Kutuzov's army clashed with units of the French army commanded by Murat, who were in an observing position on the Chernishna River in front of Tarutino, where Kutuzov's headquarters were located. The attack was carried out by General Bennigsen against the will of Kutuzov. This clash unfolded into a battle, later called the Battle of Tarutino, and ended with Murat being driven back to the village of Spas-Kuplya. This episode showed Napoleon that Kutuzov intensified after Borodin, and further initiatives of the Russian army could be expected. Napoleon leaving the Kremlin Napoleon gave the order to Marshal √âdouard Mortier, who was appointed by him the Moscow Governor General, to set fire to wine shops, barracks and all public buildings in the city, with the exception of the Orphanage, before setting fire to Moscow, to set fire to the Kremlin palace and put gunpowder under the Kremlin walls. The Kremlin explosion was to follow the departure of the last French troops from the city. On October 19, by order of Napoleon, the army from Moscow moved along the Old Kaluga Road. Only Mortier's corps remained in Moscow. Initially, Napoleon intended to attack the Russian Army and, having defeated it, get into the war-ravaged regions of the country to provide its troops with food and fodder. Napoleon made his first stop at night in the village of Troitsky on the banks of the Desna River. Here for several days was his main apartment. While here, he abandoned his original plan ‚Äì to attack Kutuzov, since in this case he had to withstand a battle like Borodinsky, with even more unclear prospects for victory than in Borodino. But even if the new battle ended in victory for Napoleon, it could no longer change the main thing: the abandonment of Moscow by him. Napoleon foresaw the impression that his departure from Moscow would make in Europe, and was afraid of this impression. Napoleon decided to turn right from the Old Kaluga Road, bypass the location of the Russian army, go out onto the Borovskaya Road, go through the untouched places along the Kaluga Governorate to the south-west, moving to Smolensk. He intended, calmly reaching Maloyaroslavets and Kaluga to Smolensk, to winter in either Smolensk or Vilna, and to continue the war with Russia in the future. Undermining the Kremlin When the Ivan the Great Bell Tower was blown up, all the later outbuildings fell off. \\"I left Moscow, ordering to blow up the Kremlin\\", Napoleon wrote to his wife on October 10. The night before he had sent from his main apartment in the village of Troitsky, Mortier, the order to finally leave Moscow and immediately join the army with his corps, and to blow up the Kremlin before the performance. This order was only partially fulfilled, as in the bustle of a sudden speech, Mortier did not have enough time to properly deal with this matter. To its foundation, only the Vodovzvodnaya Tower was destroyed, the Nikolskaya Tower, 1st Bezymyannaya and Petrovskaya Towers, the Kremlin wall and part of the arsenal were badly damaged. The Faceted Chamber burned from the explosion. As contemporaries noted with malice, when trying to undermine the tallest building in Moscow, the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, it remained unharmed, unlike the later outbuildings: Return of the Russians Looting of Moscow left by residents After the French left Moscow, the cavalry vanguard of the Russian army was the first to enter the city under the command of General Alexander von Benkendorf (whose commander General Ferdinand von Wintzingerode was then captured by Mortier). On October 26, Benckendorf wrote to General Mikhail Vorontsov:Alexander Benckendorf. Scrapbook Other memoirists also report that the Russian army found in the city crowds of peasants engaged in drunkenness, robbery and vandalism.Sergey Bakhrushin. Moscow in 1812. Edition of the Imperial Society of History and Antiquities of Russia at Moscow University, 1913. Page 26 According to an account byAlexander Shakhovskoy: Moscow Chief Police Officer Ivashkin, in a report to Rostopchin dated October 16, estimates the number of corpses removed from the streets of Moscow at 11,959, and horse ‚Äì at 12,546. Upon returning to the city, Rostopchin ordered not to arrange a property redistribution and leave the looted goods to those in whose hands it fell,Rostopchin and Ivashkin themselves profit from the distribution of property confiscated from the stores of foreigners who chose to leave Moscow with the retreating French army. limiting itself to compensation for the victims. Learning about this order, the people rushed to the Sunday market near the Sukharev Tower: \\"On the first Sunday the mountains of the looted property blocked a huge area, and Moscow surged into the unprecedented market!\\" (Gilyarovsky). In the imperial manifesto of August 30, 1814, an amnesty was declared for most of the crimes committed during the Napoleonic invasion.

Assuming the role of three different starships ‚Äî the Winger, Gamma and Beta ‚Äî the player is tasked with completing six stages by destroying enemies and avoiding collision with them and their projectiles. The Gamma gives the player a tailgun that can fire forwards and backwards, and the Beta doubles the player's firepower. These ships can be found by destroying small bases found throughout stages. By collecting small \\"F\\" icons from defeating enemies, the player can combine all three ships into one for increased power ‚Äî combining with one other ship gives the Winger a wave beam, and combining with two provides the Winger with heat-seeking lasers that automatically lock onto enemies. The player can also launch a powerful screen- clearing bomb in the form of a flaming phoenix that glides across the screen. Stages end with a boss that must be defeated to progress. By performing a button combination on the main menu, the player can access a cheat giving them 99 lives at the beginning of the game. Development and release Terra Cresta 3D was released in Japan by Nichibutsu for the Sega Saturn on August 8, 1997 in Japan. It is the second Terra Cresta game to not have any involvement with series creator Shigeki Fujiwara, as several years prior he left Nichibutsu to work on the Bomberman series for Hudson Soft. Described as \\"the heart and soul of the company\\" by Hardcore Gaming 101, his departure left Nichibutsu struggling to produce any successful action-oriented games, instead releasing a number of pornographic mahjong arcade titles throughout the late 1990s. Terra Cresta 3D is one of the company's last video games alongside titles such as Battle Round USA, as they suspended their operations in the early 2000s. Reception Famitsu was negative towards the game's slow pace and inferiority to similar titles available on the Saturn, believing that the core gameplay of Terra Cresta was unsuitable for a 3D shooting game. GameFan expressed a lukewarm response towards its slow pace and low difficulty level, although liked its polygonal graphics and soundtrack. They compared it unfavorably to Namco's Xevious 3D/G. Next Generation magazine was especially critical towards the game, finding its 3D visuals \\"pathetic\\" and its level designs \\"of the lowest, common-denominator, cookie-cutter, purple-blotchy- copy-of-every-other-shooter-known-to-mankind variety\\". They especially disliked its usage of polygons due to it slowing down the game speed, and found the game to be a disappointment compared to the original Moon Cresta and Terra Cresta. Next Generation suggested that players instead wait for Raizing's Terra Diver or Taito's RayStorm. SuperGamesPower liked the idea of combining the player's ships together to form a much more powerful one, comparing it to arcade titles like Galaxian and Xevious. In a 2016 retrospective review, Jess Ragan of Hardcore Gaming 101 called it a \\"disconcertingly watered down sequel\\" to the original Terra Cresta, disliking its graphics, transparency effects, camera angle and overall gameplay for being inferior to other shooters on the Saturn and to earlier titles in the series. The departure of series creator Shigeki Fujiwara was also cited by Ragan as a reason for the game's sudden downturn in quality compared to earlier entries, as well as the overall state of the video game industry at the time and impending dominance of 3D graphics. He felt that it was \\"a miracle\\" that the game was even made due to Nichibutsu mainly devoting their video game operations towards pornographic mahjong arcade games towards the late 1990s. Ragan also praised the soundtrack for its usage of orchestral remixes of tracks from the original, saying that had Nichibutsu put the same amount of effort into the game as they did with the music it \\"could have been something special\\".

It was published on 6 March 2018 by Flatiron Books (a subdivision of Macmillan Publishers), and is Rao's debut novel. It tells the story of two girls, Poornima and Savitha, from the village of Indravelli in Telangana, India. Writing Rao, who was born in Kanpur to a family from the weaver caste of an Andhra town called Mangalagiri, has said, \\"I grew up observing the lives of women around me, this subset who had poor education, poor health their lives were very devalued. I've always been interested in the specific vulnerabilities of some women, especially in times of conflict.\\" She stated that the novel was written over the course of two months in the Badlands of South Dakota, without access to television, internet or radio. She also revealed that she initially wrote the book as a single narrative, before editing it to jump between the two girls' points of view. In another interview, she said that the violence in the book was partly based on the stories of abuse victims she had heard during her years as a legal advocate in the field of domestic violence. Plot Poornima is a girl born into a poor family of weavers in the Indian village of Indravelli in Telangana. Her mother dies of cancer when she is 16. Soon after, Poornima‚Äôs father hires a local girl, 17-year-old Savitha, to help with the looms. Poornima and Savitha strike up a friendship. One night as Savitha is working at Poornima‚Äôs house, Poornima‚Äôs father rapes her. As punishment, the village elders rule that he must marry her. Savitha runs away from the village but falls into the hands of a pimp, called Guru, who forces her into prostitution. Meanwhile, Poornima has an arranged marriage to an accountant in the nearby village. Her father can only pay a portion of the dowry at the time of marriage but promises to pay the remaining within a year. A year passes but the dowry remains unpaid. Enraged, Poornima‚Äôs husband and mother-in-law douse her in hot oil, leaving her face permanently disfigured. Poornima flees and eventually finds her way to Guru after one of his scouts indicates he knew Savitha. Due to her disfigurement, she is saved from prostitution and instead hired to keep the ring's accounting books, a skill she picked up during her marriage. Over time, Poornima comes to learn that Savitha belonged to the ring and has been sent to Seattle, USA, supposedly as domestic help. Her arm was amputated so that she could obtain the necessary medical visa to enter the US. Determined to be reunited with her, Poornima convinces Guru to use her as a ‚Äúshepherd‚Äù ‚Äì a middleman to deliver girls from the pimp to foreign clients. Guru eventually agrees and she is assigned to shepherd a girl to Seattle. Upon reaching Seattle, Poornima learns that Savitha has escaped from her owner. With the help of the owner‚Äôs son, who has feelings for Savitha, Poornima sets out to find her. The book ends with Savitha and Poornima on either side of a bathroom door, neither having seen the other one yet. Reception The book received mostly positive reviews from critics. The Free Press Journal praised the book's \\"psychological streak, nay blitzkrieg, which shines and blazes through their association and interminable obstacles they were subject to\\" but warned the book was \\"a tad boring for those who look for a flux of plots in a novel.\\" San Francisco Chronicle likened it to \\"a Thomas Hardy novel on steroids ‚Äî if not leavened with subtle moments of humanity and joy, smaller emotions conveyed with tremendous lyricism\\". The Guardian called it \\"a timely and harrowing portrayal of human trafficking, cultural misogyny and the battles still fought every day by millions of women worldwide\\" but also noted that \\"the relentlessness of the abuse [means] that by the time we reach the novel‚Äôs final act of sexual brutality, there is a feeling of weary acceptance ‚Äì by both Savitha and the reader ‚Äì that this is just how life is\\". The New York Times echoed this sentiment, and also called the portrayal of India in the book as \\"hazardous in the current global moment [...] If all Indians really were so relentlessly cruel as the characters in Rao‚Äôs novel, you couldn‚Äôt blame someone for not wanting them living next door\\".

The remains have been dated to the Roman or Byzantine period in history and included the port, associated warehouses, quarries and a ship repair yard. The site was believed to have been in existence from the 5th to 6th centuries AD. The site was most likely a waypoint for resupply for ships transiting around the Mediterranean Sea between Greece, Egypt, Syria and Turkey. The location is inside RAF Akrotiri, part of the Sovereign Base Area on Akrotiri Peninsula and under the control of the British military and as such is not open to the general public. Several archaeological investigations have been undertaken on the site, and also in the water surrounding the port, which have uncovered stone columns resting on the seabed. The abandonment of the port most likely occurred after a natural disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami. The site is often labelled as \\"one of the best-preserved ancient ports in the Mediterranean\\". History Heavy rains along the peninsula during 1973 and 1974 revealed some masonry in the area around Dreamer's Bay. This prompted minor archaeological investigation through the 1980s, but the largest digs have been from 2015, with five major investigations each year up until 2019, the most recent one. The port is thought to have existed between 100 and 600 AD (Roman/Byzantium times), though it could have existed since the 3rd century BC (Hellenistic). The port had a submerged artificial breakwater and was believed to have served as a maritime link of the city of Kourion, some to the north west. There are some advanced geographical theories that the Akrotiri Peninsula was actually an island and the city of Kourion was much nearer the sea. The peninsula silted up at both sides and prompted the building of a new harbour at Dreamer's Bay. This would have made the port at Dreamer's Bay a valuable waypoint between the ancient countries of Greece, Egypt and Turkey, as well as affording supplies in and out of Cyprus. The port complex is thought to have consisted of several masonry style buildings used as warehouses with associated chandlery and adjacent quarries. No domestic accommodation is believed to have existed there as none of the early digs had revealed any evidence of such a structure, but later evidence suggested a small amount of burning and debris from pots, which could be indicative of domestic activity. One of the theories about why the port was abandoned is the possibility of a tsunami like event which wrecked the port and destroyed ships in the port. Stone columns found lying on the seabed are believed to have been on their way from Egypt to Antioch. Finds of coins and roofing materials suggest the site was in use until at least the 6th century AD. Fragments of pottery have been dated to the 4th century with their destruction possibly being in an earthquake in 360 AD which wrought devastation upon nearby Kourion. Successive marine investigations have also uncovered a shipwreck just south of the port area that covers an area of . The vessel is assumed to have been on the large size as over 800 necks of amphorae were discovered in the wreck area survey. Other archaeological remains have been discovered further inland, including one with a possible spiral staircase, which could have been a tower. Whilst these buildings were not at the highest elevation on the peninsula, they would have afforded the best view from both capes at the southern end of Akrotiri. Items that have been uncovered and are able to be transported away from the site have been put into storage for possible display in a future museum on the island. Location The site is located near to Aetokremnos, () in the Limassol District on the southern tip of Cyprus, known as the Akrotiri Peninsula. The existence of humans has been dated to around 12,500 BP with animal bones radiocarbon dated to that period. The coastline along the southern edge of Akrotiri is largely cliffs and the site at Dreamer's Bay would have been the only suitable location for a port. As the site is on a military base away from the main operating and domestic areas, it has a very restricted access and is largely free of human interference. As such, the find is quite rare and has led to the site being recognised as being \\"one of the best-preserved ancient ports in the Mediterranean\\". The location of the site affords a good view of Cape Zevgari to the west and Cape Gata to the east; so this would provide ample warning of approaching shipping and serve as a landmark for vessels wishing to call in at the port. The British military have acknowledged that the archaeological remains are part of the Cypriot culture and heritage, but their care and administration is the responsibility of the Sovereign Base Area.

It is listed as a Historic Monument. History A church named Saint-Christophe et Notre-Dame was mentioned on this site in the early 13th century. It may have been built in the Carolingian era. As of 1242, the chapel was affiliated with Saint-Marcel of Saint-Denis. After a long drought on 14 May, 1336, a young girl praying the Virgin Mary saw the eyes of the statue cry and heard the rain fall in the same time. After the miracle, the chapel could not accommodate the flow of pilgrims and a new church was built on the site in the 15th century. The 30-meter-high squared tower, dated 1541 according to an inscription on its base, is said to have been built by Louis XI. In 1623, the Oratorians settled in the buildings given by Francis II of Montholon. A Jesuit-style fa√ßade was erected around 1628. A 9-meter-high spire was added in the 19th century but was destroyed by a fire in 1900. In 1614, Louis XIII pronounced his vows in the church and notably promised to \\"build a church dedicated to the Virgin in Paris if the struggle against the Protestants was victorious\\". So he built Notre-Dame-des-Victoires which is considered as the daughter church of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus. An organ was manufactured from 1630 to 1635. It was restored by organ builders Robert Chauvin from Dax and Louis Benoist and Pierre Sarelot from Le Mans. It is the only preserved organ of the 17th-century in √éle-de-France. It was inaugurated on 10 November 1990 by organist Michel Chapuis and Alain Cuny.Programme of the inauguration of the organ on Saturday 10 November 1990 under the presidency of Jack Ralite, mayor of Aubervillers The organ has 30 stops, three keyboards and a French-style pedalboard. In 2012, the church was restored at a cost of ‚Ç¨1.367 million, co-financed by the Regional Directorate of Cultural Affairs (DRAC, 40 percent), the municipality of Aubervilliers (30 percent) and the Regional and General councils. The church was listed as a Class Historic Monument on 17 July 1908. Pilgrimage A pilgrimage takes place every year from the Basilica of Saint-Denis to the church of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus. Another former pilgrimage from Saint-Denys de la Chapelle to Notre-Dame des Vertus granted the pilgrims plenary indulgence. This devotion dates back to 1338, when the celebration was held on the second Tuesday of May. The celebrations took place on the feast days of Annunciation, Easter Monday and Tuesday, on 1 May (the date of the current pilgrimage) and other days. On 22 May, 1452, Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville granted indulgence to the visitors of Notre-Dame-des-Vertus. These were extended by Pope Paul V on Immaculate Conception Day.

Biography Laing was born in Glasgow and studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1888 to 1894, when she won a Haldane Travelling Scholarship which allowed her to study in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens. Laing subsequently lived at Frascati in Italy and in London for a time but most of her life was spent in Glasgow. She joined the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists in 1908, the same year in which she married the artist James Garden Laing. Laing mostly exhibited her work in Scotland, being a regular exhibitor with the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and, less frequently, with both the Royal Scottish Academy and the Aberdeen Artists Society. Laing also took part in exhibitions in both Munich and Rome during 1911 and at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and had at least three works shown at the Royal Academy in London. She died at Uckfield in Sussex. The Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow holds examples of her paintings.

It targets a specific mutation, G12C, in the protein KRAS which is responsible for various forms of cancer. Clinical development AMG 510 is being developed by Amgen. Phase 1 clinical trials were completed in late 2020. In December 2019, it was approved to begin Phase 2 clinical trials. Because the G12C KRAS mutation is relatively common in some cancer types, 14% of non- small-cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma patients and 5% of colorectal cancer patients, and AMG 510 is the first drug candidate to target this mutation, there have been high expectations for the drug. The Food and Drug Administration has granted a fast track designation to AMG 510 for the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma with the G12C KRAS mutation. Chemistry and pharmacology AMG 510 can exist in either of two atropisomeric forms and one is more active than the other. It selectively forms an irreversible covalent bond to the sulfur atom in the cysteine residue that is present in the mutated form of KRAS, but not in the normal form.
