The cricketers were on their way to play the third day of the second Test against the Pakistani cricket team. Six members of the Sri Lanka national cricket team were wounded and six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed. The attack was believed to have been carried out by Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. In August 2016, three of the terrorists involved in the attack were killed during a police raid in Lahore. In October, the attack's mastermind was killed in eastern Afghanistan during a military operation, while hiding there.ri Lanka cricket team attack mastermind 'killed' in Afghanistan In December 2019, Sri Lanka agreed to play two match test series in Pakistan and marked test cricket return to Pakistan after a decade since the terror attack. Background of the tour The safety of touring cricket teams in Pakistan had long been an issue. In May 2002, New Zealand abandoned their Test series in Pakistan after a suicide bomb attack outside their hotel. However, they returned in the 2003/2004 season to fulfill their commitments. Australia had refused to tour in October 2002 on safety grounds. The Sri Lankan cricket team was in Pakistan as a replacement for the Indian team, who had pulled out after the Mumbai attacks. In order to persuade the Sri Lankan team to visit, the Pakistan government offered to give them presidential-style security. The series was the first Test tour of Pakistan since South Africa visited in October 2007. Attack Black/grey depicts the route for team convoy. The escape route for attackers is shown in blue. According to the officials, 12 gunmen were hiding near Liberty Square, in the centre of Lahore, waiting for the Sri Lankan team to pass on their way to the Gaddafi stadium. They started firing at the bus when it crossed the road. The Pakistan police escorting the team returned fire; in the ensuing fighting, six policemen and two civilians died. After about 20 minutes, the militants fled, leaving behind rocket launchers and grenades. The gunmen first shot at the wheels of the bus, and then fired at the bus itself and its occupants. The attackers had fired a rocket at the bus, which missed and hit a nearby electric pole. The driver of the bus, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, had then kept on driving a distance of about until they reached the stadium. Khalil was awarded Tamgha-i-Shujaat for his bravery. The attackers had also thrown a grenade under the bus, which exploded after the bus had passed over it. A minivan following the team bus carrying the match referee and umpires was also fired upon and the driver was killed. Simon Taufel, Steve Davis, Nadeem Ghauri, Ahsan Raza, umpires performance manager Peter Manuel, liaison officer Abdul Sami and ICC match referee Chris Broad were in this minivan. The minivan was subsequently allegedly abandoned by security personnel and no bullets were fired by the security forces for twenty minutes. Chris Broad threw himself over and kept his hand on the chest of Ahsan Raza to slow down the profuse bleeding from a bullet injury. A police officer who climbed into the minivan to seek cover drove the minivan to safety. Security cameras captured footage of several gunmen carrying automatic weapons and backpacks, firing on the convoy from the Liberty Square roundabout. They were later seen jogging up the street and escaping on motorcycles. The video was broadcast around the world presenting pictures of the attacks. CCTV footage has been made public. They arrived at 8:39 am local time and left at 8:46 am. The attackers were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades, RPG launchers, claymores and explosive charges. The Sri Lankan team were then taken to the stadium and airlifted from the pitch via Pakistan Air Force Mil Mi-17 helicopters, and immediate arrangements were made for the Sri Lankan team to return to Colombo on the next available flight. The second Test, which was the last scheduled fixture of the tour, was abandoned as a draw. Injuries Several team members sustained minor wounds, including:Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene was one of those injured. * Thilan Samaraweera * Kumar Sangakkara (vice-captain) * Tharanga Paranavitana * Ajantha Mendis * Chaminda Vaas * Mahela Jayawardene (captain) * Suranga Lakmal Six Pakistani policemen and two civilians were killed in the attack. Samaraweera and Paranavitana were hospitalised following the incident. The others had sustained minor injuries and shrapnel wounds. Samaraweera sustained shrapnel wounds to his thigh, and Paranavitana to his chest. The team's Assistant Coach Paul Farbrace was also injured. Although it was reported that Coach Trevor Bayliss also sustained minor injuries, it was later announced that this was incorrect. Reserve umpire Ahsan Raza, who was travelling in a van for the umpires that was following the Sri Lankan team bus, was shot twice and taken to hospital. The driver of the minibus was killed in the attack. Investigation and attribution Immediately following the attacks, Pakistani authorities blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a militant organisation banned in Pakistan.Strike had hallmarks of Mumbai massacre, The Independent, 3 March 2009 Pakistani officials said that the attacks were similar to the Mumbai attacks. Most of the Pakistani press blamed Pakistani Islamist militants and Al-Qaeda for the attacks.Two dozen held in Lahore as FBI director arrives, The Canberra Times, 5 March 2009 Police said that kidnapping was a possible motive, but police officials refused to comment on this. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said on 4 March that he could not rule out involvement of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the Lahore attacks. Some European intelligence sources supported this suspicion. Sri Lankan military officials, on the other hand, were skeptical of LTTE involvement, and an LTTE spokesperson labelled reports of LTTE connection as 'not true'.Press Trust of India (2009), LTTE denies link to Lahore attack. A junior Pakistani cabinet minister said that the government had evidence that the attackers came from India.

Statements by Australian umpire Simon Taufel, match referee Chris Broad, and spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan, referencing this delay sparked conspiracy theories that the militants were acting on inside information. Later, Muralitharan expressed alarm at such interpretations of his comments and explained that he only suspected the gunmen to be monitoring the team movements. Federal Bureau of Investigation director Robert Mueller arrived in Pakistan the day after these attacks and met with Pakistani officials to discuss security issues and the Mumbai attacks.FBI chief in Pakistan after attack on cricketers, International Herald Tribune, 4 March 2009 Interior Adviser Rehman Malik, told the National Assembly Standing Committee on the Interior that no evidence of LeT's involvement has been found so far, and that sufficient evidence has been surfaced pointing to involvement of a foreign hand. =Security lapse= The Investigation committee found three Superintendents of police (SPs) to have neglected the initial warning. by Intelligence agencies The Chief Minister of Punjab had also tipped off the authorities about a possible threat to the Sri Lankan team a month before. =Arrests= On 5 March, Salmaan Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, said the individuals responsible for the attack had been identified, but would not be revealed until the investigation was complete. Sports Cluster Worldwide The province offered a reward of 10 million rupees (US$125,000) for information leading to the capture of the militants responsible for the attack. Police in Punjab arrested over 250 suspects, including 4 who were said to be 'prime suspects'. Police called Muhammad Aqeel, who ran a sports bikes business in Islampura, the mastermind behind the attack, and said that he had received a call from one of the militants at 9:05 am on the morning of the attacks asking for instructions. Though Aqeel was still absconding, his brother, Muhammad Faisal, had been arrested. Police also arrested Shahzad Babar of Rahim Yar Khan after a Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card registered in his name was used in the attack along with eight others. Security officials in Pakistan told The Times that most of the two dozen people arrested in connection with the attacks belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, outlawed militant groups with close links to Al- Qaeda.Gunmen who attacked cricketers in Lahore 'had links to al-Qaeda', The Times, 6 March 2009 Aqeel, who is an activist of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, escaped a police raid on his home in Kahuta on 9 March 2009.Lahore attack 'mastermind' escapes police raid in Punjab, The Times, 9 March 2009 Also another gunman Zubair, aka Naik Mohammad, of Zubair, was arrested from Madina Colony, Walton Road in Lahore.

Other accused including Samiullah, alias Ejaz of Nankana district, Adnan, alias Sajjad, Ajmal alias Ahsaan, Farooq, Ameer of Punjab Taliban, and Umer, alias Abdul Wahab of D. I. Khan, were still at large. The attack was planned at Tauheed Hotel, and a house rented for this purpose in Madina Colony, Walton Road. The auto rickshaws used in the attack were purchased by Samiullah. A secret investigative report has surfaced later prepared by the Additional Inspector General of the Crime Investigation Division, Punjab on 22 January 2009 outlining the potential threat to the Sri Lankan team.

The 2011 Cricket World Cup was to be co-hosted by Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, but in the wake of this attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team the International Cricket Council (ICC) stripped Pakistan of its hosting rights due to security concerns. The headquarters of the organising committee were originally situated in Lahore, but was then shifted to Mumbai. Pakistan was supposed to hold 14 matches, including one semi-final. Eight of Pakistan's matches were awarded to India, four to Sri Lanka and two to Bangladesh. The Sri Lankan Foreign minister has said the Sri Lankan cricket team \\"will give highest consideration to the invitation extended to it to undertake visit again. Sri Lanka will not allow Pakistan's isolation in cricket.\\" In October 2017, the Sri Lankan cricket team returned to Pakistan for the first time since the attack to play a Twenty20 International match at the Gaddafi Stadium. In September 2019, the Sri Lankan team toured Pakistan, playing a 3-match One-Day International series in National Stadium, Karachi and a 3-match Twenty20 International series in Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore.

Its nucleus contains 17 protons and 20 neutrons for a total of 37 nucleons. Chlorine-37 accounts for 24.23% of natural chlorine, chlorine-35 accounting for 75.77%, giving chlorine atoms in bulk an apparent atomic weight of . Remarkably, solar neutrinos were discovered by an experiment using a radiochemical method based on chlorine-37 transmutation. Neutrino detection One of the historically important radiochemical methods of solar neutrino detection is based on inverse electron capture triggered by the absorption of an electron neutrino. Chlorine-37 transmutes into argon-37 via the reaction : + → + . Argon-37 then de-excites itself via electron capture (half-life = 35 d) into chlorine-37 via the reaction : + → + . These last reactions involve Auger electrons of specific energies. The detection of these electrons confirms that a neutrino event took place. Detection methods involve several hundred thousand liters of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4) stored in underground tanks. Occurrence The representative terrestrial abundance of chlorine-37 is 24.22(4)% of chlorine atoms, with a normal range of 24.14–24.36% of chlorine atoms.

His first two SF novels, The Dark Gateway (1953) and The Echoing Worlds (1954), both dealt with the theme of parallel universes; and Pursuit Through Time (1956) described an attempt to change the course of history while time-travelling into the past. For more than thirty years Burke novelised a large number of stage plays, film and TV scripts, notably John Osborne's The Entertainer and Look Back in Anger, The Angry Silence (all 1960), Flame in the Streets (1961), The Lion of Sparta (1961; the film was released as The 300 Spartans), The Boys (1962), The System (1963), A Hard Day's Night (1964), Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), That Magnificent Air Race (1965; the film was released as Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines), The Hammer Horror Omnibus (1966/7; two volumes), Till Death Us Do Part, Privilege (both 1967), Smashing Time, Ian Fleming's Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (both 1968), Moon Zero Two (1969), Luke's Kingdom (1976), King and Castle (1986) and a series of The Bill novels, beginning in 1985. A Hard Day's Night came close to not being published at all. The then Director of Pan Books, Clarence Paget, saw the Beatles as nothing but a passing fad, and it took Burke and many of Pan's office workers – all Beatles fans – to persuade Paget otherwise. The book went on to sell 1.25 million copies. Several other tie-ins appeared under the names of Martin Sands and Robert Miall, including Maroc 7 (1967), The Best House in London (1969), two Jason King thrillers in 1972, and also UFO and its sequel UFO 2 (1970/1971). Burke also wrote the source story for the 1967 cult horror film The Sorcerers. The screenplay has now been published in a limited edition of 500 copies. Burke also contributed to the TV series Late Night Horror (BBC, 1968), Tales of Unease (LWT, 1970) and The Frighteners (LWT, 1972). Among Burke's later novels were a series featuring the Victorian psychic investigator and occult detective Dr Alex Caspian (a stage magician by day, assisted by his wife, Bronwen), and a further three Victorian Gothic suspense novels (by \\"Harriet Esmond\\") written in collaboration with his wife Jean.\\"Burke, John\\" by Chris Morgan in David Pringle, St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost and Gothic Writers. London: St. James Press, 1998, (pp. 107-109). These were always carefully researched, and explored the regions described in these stories. He edited a trilogy of books under the \\"Unease\\" banner: Tales of Unease (1966), More Tales of Unease (1969) and New Tales of Unease (1976). Several ghost and horror stories appeared in the Pan \\"Ghost Book\\" series, the Pan Book of Horror Stories, New Terrors, The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror and his short stories were collected in the Ash Tree Press volume We've Been Waiting For You (2000), which included his most celebrated story, \\"And Cannot Come Again\\". He wrote two original short stories that were subsequently published in Johnny Mains's tribute book Back From The Dead: The Legacy of the Pan Book of Horror Stories (2010), was interviewed at length about his tie-in career for Bedabbled! magazine (2011) and was in talks to publish a novel that began life in the 1950s and was rejuvenated in early 2011. Robert Hale also published five novels in the last decade: Stalking Widow (2000), The Second Strain (2002), Wrong Turnings (2004), Hang Time (2007) and The Merciless Dead (2008). Burke also wrote over twenty non-fiction titles, including several travel books for Batsford: Suffolk (1971), Sussex (1974), English Villages (1975), Czechoslovakia (1976) and The English Inn (1981). In 1985 he reached the semi- finals in TV's Mastermind; his wife Jean also reached the semi-finals two years later.

R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, Faramir is a fictional character appearing in The Lord of the Rings. He is introduced as the younger brother of Boromir of the Fellowship of the Ring and second son of Denethor II, the Steward of the realm of Gondor. The relationships between the three men are revealed over the course of the book and are elaborated in the appendices. Faramir first enters the narrative in person in The Two Towers, where, upon meeting Frodo Baggins, he is presented with a temptation to take possession of the One Ring. In The Return of the King, he led the forces of Gondor during the War of the Ring, coming near to death, and eventually succeeded his father as the Steward and won the love of Éowyn of Rohan. In The History of The Lord of the Rings series Christopher Tolkien recorded that his father had not foreseen the emergence of Faramir during the writing of the book, only inventing him at the actual point of his appearance in The Two Towers. J. R. R. Tolkien noted that the introduction of Faramir had led to postponement of the book's dénouement and to further development of the background for Gondor and Rohan. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write that of all characters Faramir resembles the author most, and that he had deliberately bestowed upon the character several traits of his own. LiteratureBackground= The early years of Faramir's life are described in the main narrative of The Lord of the Rings only briefly, with more detail revealed in the appendices. It is stated that Faramir was born in the year 2983 of the Third Age; his father, Denethor II, was a man of noble descent and the heir to the Stewardship of Gondor, ascending a year after Faramir's birth. Denethor had married Finduilas, daughter of Prince Adrahil of Dol Amroth; however, she died untimely when Faramir was five, and is said to have remained to him \\"but a memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief\\". After her death Denethor became sombre, cold, and detached from his family, but the relationship between Faramir and Boromir, who was five years older, only grew closer. The brothers greatly loved and highly esteemed each other, and neither in childhood nor in later years was there any jealousy or rivalry between them, even though Denethor openly favoured his elder son. Tolkien wrote that Faramir was used to giving way and not airing his own opinions. Among other things, Faramir displeased his father in that he welcomed the wizard Gandalf who occasionally visited Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor. Being eager for knowledge, Faramir learned much from Gandalf about the history of the realm and about the death of Isildur. Gondor had long been threatened by the nearby realm of Mordor, and in 3018 (when Faramir was 35) the Dark Lord Sauron began the War of the Ring, attacking the ruined city of Osgiliath that guarded the passage to Minas Tirith. Faramir and Boromir commanded the defence, and were among those few who survived when the eastern half of Osgiliath was captured and the bridges across the River Anduin were destroyed. In The Fellowship of the Ring it is recounted that shortly before the battle Faramir had a prophetic dream, which later often recurred to him and once to Boromir. In this dream a voice spoke about the \\"Sword that was Broken\\" that was to be found at Imladris far to the north, about the awakening of \\"Isildur's Bane\\", approach of \\"Doom\\", and appearance of \\"the Halfling\\". Faramir decided to journey to Imladris and seek advice of Elrond the Half-elven, but Boromir claimed the errand for himself, fearing for his brother, and was approved by Denethor and a council of the elders; Faramir remained to defend Gondor. =The Two Towers= Faramir first encountered the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized them to be the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the dead body of his brother, who had been killed by Orcs after Frodo left the group. Faramir also asked about the purpose of Frodo's mission, but Frodo tried to avoid the subject. Faramir determined that Frodo was carrying one of Sauron's great weapons. In the Rangers’ secret refuge behind the waterfall, Henneth Annûn, Sam accidentally spoke of Boromir’s desire for the One Ring, thus revealing the item Frodo was carrying. Faramir then showed the crucial difference between him and his proud brother: Despite the Hobbits’ fears, Faramir was wise enough to realize that such a weapon was not to be used and if desired, should be resisted. With this knowledge, he also realized what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir would not have been able to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them. =The Return of the King= The following evening in Cair Andros, Faramir sent his company south to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath, while he and three of his men rode to Minas Tirith. Along the way, they were pursued by Sauron's servants, the Nazgûl. Faramir rode back to help the fallen. Immediately, Gandalf rode out to their aid, temporarily banishing the Nazgûl. Faramir arrived at Minas Tirith and reported to Denethor and Gandalf of his encounter with Frodo and Sam. Denethor became angry that Faramir had let Frodo and Sam pass into Mordor with the Ring, instead of bringing the Ring to Minas Tirith to be hidden. Sauron's second-in-command, the Witch-king of Angmar, led a much larger force from Minas Morgul, and attacked Osgiliath. After Osgiliath was conquered, Faramir decided to stay with the rearguard in order to make sure that the retreat over Pelennor would not turn into a rout. He was gravely wounded by a Southron arrow and the Black Breath of the Nazgûl. Fortunately, all of the mounted soldiers in the city rode to his aid and brought him back to Denethor in Minas Tirith. When Faramir returned unconscious, Denethor believed him to be fatally injured. That blow, coupled with a vision in the palantír of the forces arrayed against him, drove him insane. He ordered his servants to build a funeral pyre in the House of Stewards for him and his son. Denethor's temporary servant, the Hobbit Peregrin Took, went to alert Gandalf and Beregond, one of the Tower Guards he had befriended. Gandalf and Beregond stopped the impending sacrifice just in time. Mad with grief, Denethor jumped onto the lit pyre, burning himself alive. Two days later, the battle over, Aragorn came and revived Faramir with athelas in the Houses of Healing. During his subsequent recuperation there, Faramir met the Lady Éowyn of Rohan; moved by her sorrow, pride, and beauty, he eventually fell in love with her. At first, Éowyn refused his advances, only desiring to go to war to find honour in death. But soon Éowyn realized that she had come to love him in return. Faramir took up his office as Steward, and began preparing the city for the arrival of Aragorn, who was now King of Gondor. On the day of the King’s official coronation, Faramir surrendered his office. Aragorn, however, renewed the office, and announced that as long as his line would last, Faramir and his descendants would be Stewards of Gondor. In addition, Aragorn created Faramir Prince of Ithilien and appointed Beregond Captain of Faramir's guard, the White Company. Faramir, as Prince of Ithilien, together with the Prince of Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft letter to a reader of The Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian city, once named Minas Ithil, that Sauron had taken) of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role of Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence. With Éowyn, he settled in Emyn Arnen, where the two had a son named Elboron. After Faramir’s death at the age of 120, his son succeeded him in all of his titles. Barahir, Faramir's grandson, wrote The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen, which was inserted (in an abbreviated form) in the Thain's Book by the writer Findegil, and appears in The Lord of the Rings as part of Appendix A. =Characteristics= Faramir's personality is prominently described in the appendices to The Lord of the Rings: Tolkien recorded that Faramir greatly resembled Boromir in appearance, who in his turn is described as \\"a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark- haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance\\". Members of the line of the Stewards were wont to be of a nobler appearance and bearing than most of the inhabitants of Gondor; in case of Faramir, it is stated that \\"by some chance the blood of Westernesse [ran] nearly true\\" in him, which was rare. This trait was elaborated by Tolkien through the speech of Pippin: Faramir’s leadership, skill-in-arms, and swift but hardy judgement proved valuable in battle, and earned him Gondor's respect during the War of the Ring. He defended Gondor from Sauron on many fronts, but did not enjoy fighting for its own sake. Long after completing The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien would write, \\"As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir\\". Faramir's relationship to war in Tolkien's story reflected that of the author himself, who served as an officer in the British Army during the First World War and fought in the Battle of the Somme in the latter half of 1916. Tolkien bestowed his dream of \\"darkness unescapable\\" upon Faramir's character, who relates it to Éowyn in the chapter \\"The Steward and the King\\" in The Return of the King. Of this, Tolkien wrote, \\"For when Faramir speaks of his private vision of the Great Wave, he speaks for me. That vision and dream has been ever with me — and has been inherited (as I only discovered recently) by one of my children, Michael.\\" =Names and titles= The meaning of the name Faramir was not explained by Tolkien; apparently he intended it to come from Sindarin, an Elven language constructed by him and stated to have been used by the Stewards of Gondor for naming. The first part of Faramir could have been derived from Sindarin stems meaning 'suffice' and 'hunt', and the final syllable is likely to have been the same as in his brother's name. Boromir was described by Tolkien as a name \\"of mixed form\\", and possibly combines Sindarin bor(on)- 'steadfast' with either Sindarin mîr or Quenya míre 'jewel'. However, it is also stated that the Stewards of Gondor often bore names \\"remembered in the songs and histories of the First Age\\", without paying a special attention to meaning. Thus one Boromir appears in The Silmarillion, and the appendices to The Lord of the Rings introduce Faramir, son of King Ondoher of Gondor, although in this case the name was supposedly in Quenya, as the Kings are stated to have borne High- elven names, and similarly did Ondoher's elder son, Artamir. Throughout The Lord of the Rings, Faramir is given several titles and ranks, such as the Captain of Gondor and Captain of the White Tower. (Boromir is given the latter title at an earlier point in the storyline, and in The Two Towers he is referred to as Captain-General of Gondor and High Warden of the White Tower.) After his father's death, Faramir became the Steward of Gondor, but only briefly as he laid down his office at the crowning of Aragorn; Tolkien stated that it was Denethor who was the last of the Ruling Stewards. Later Aragorn renewed Faramir's hereditary appointment as Steward to the King, and granted him the titles of the Prince of Ithilien and Lord of Emyn Arnen. Concept and creation Faramir's decision to reject the One Ring shows influences from a kind of courage and behaviour that was known to Tolkien from the medieval poem The Battle of Maldon. By not taking the Ring, Faramir rejects the desire for power and glory and the desire for renown which a defeat of Sauron would bring him. The speed of the relationship of Faramir and Éowyn reflects a culture which Tolkien describes to be \\"less corrupt\\", and nobler in which the \\"petty fencing and approaches\\" of courtly love is disregarded. A factor in the development of their love came from Tolkien's personal belief that feelings grew quickly in periods of great stress and under the expectation of death. Originally, Tolkien employed the use of thou and thee in The Lord of the Rings to show a \\"deliberate change to a form of affection or endearment\\" (see T-V distinction). His son has presented the original drafts for the chapter \\"The Steward and the King\\", in which such usage was employed to emphasize the relationship's development: Portrayal in adaptationsArt= Anke Eißmann's portrayal of Faramir interrogating Frodo Faramir appears in several illustrations created by John Howe, Ted Nasmith and Anke Eißmann for The Lord of the Rings and related products.See the illustrations by John Howe: , One of the scenes from the book that received many depictions is Faramir and Éowyn's meeting at the top of Minas Tirith.Anke Eißmann's gallery for Book 6 of The Lord of the Rings and Ted Nasmith's Éowyn and Faramir and The Sun Unveiled are prominent examples of art illustrating their meeting. Eißmann apparently follows the book in presenting Faramir as dark-haired and beardless, also emphasising his recent recovery in the illustration for the dialogue with Éowyn; Nasmith depicts Faramir as bearded and brown-haired. =Radio= In the BBC's 1981 radio adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, Faramir is voiced by Andrew Seear. The radio drama is known for adhering faithfully to the books, and Peter Jackson gives BBC's 1981 radio adaptation credit in the production of his film trilogy. The characterisation of Faramir follows that of the original closely; the character is able to resist the One Ring, in direct contrast to the portrayal in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. =Film= In Rankin/Bass' 1980 adaptation of The Return of the King, a dark-haired man is shown next to Éowyn in greeting Aragorn as he arrives to Minas Tirith. This character could be interpreted as Faramir.CedMagic.com David Wenham as Faramir in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Faramir is played by David Wenham. The actor jokes that he got the role because he and Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses.Cameras in Middle-earth: Filming The Two Towers, DVD Documentary Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in Unfinished Tales, lacked beards. The plot of the second film, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, introduces a significant deviation from the book: Faramir does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them to Osgiliath and not until the Nazgûl attack the city and Frodo comes under the threat of capture does he release them. Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. In fact, according to the timeline given by Tolkien, Frodo and Sam had only reached the Black Gate at the time of the fall of Isengard. Jackson also argues that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because in his films everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent in the eyes of a film audience. Co-screenwriter Philippa Boyens and actor David Wenham defended the changes to Faramir's character in order to increase dramatic tension: Faramir's \\"sea-green incorruptible\\" nature in the book would not have \\"[translated] well filmically\\". Wenham (who had not read the book until after filming had commenced) also found Tolkien's original \\"dramatically dead\\". Many readers remain unconvinced by the cast and crew's justifications, and others note that Faramir was rendered too much like Boromir and thus the contrast between the two was severely weakened. A scene that received additional criticism is the Rangers' treatment of Gollum, who is beaten up, and Faramir's implicit compliance. In the book, Faramir calls the creature Sméagol instead of Gollum, and tells his men to \\"treat him gently, but watch him\\". In the extended edition of The Two Towers, Jackson included an invented flashback scene showing that Denethor had neglected him in favour of Boromir when sending him to Rivendell, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. (The relationship is similarly strained in the book, but his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien.) Reviewers have opined that the extended edition presents Faramir in a more favourable light. =Video games= Faramir is a bonus playable character in the video game The Return of the King. In a bonus video track within this game, Wenham says that \\"Faramir and Boromir were brothers, and it isn't beyond possibility that Faramir would have gone to Rivendell instead. And if that happened, Faramir could have survived and returned to Gondor.\\" He appears as a playable hero in E.A.'s The Battle for Middle-earth, and The Battle for Middle-earth II as well as its expansion pack, The Rise of the Witch-king. Faramir has the unique ability within the game to change between three different classes. At the beginning of battle Faramir is set as an archer but can be changed to use his sword for melee combat and can change to a rider for cavalry assaults. While in archer form he has reasonable attack strength but lacks the speed of Legolas. Faramir has the ability to raise the experience of a select group of archers once he reaches a certain level. Faramir appears as a playable hero in The Lord of the Rings: Conquest. Faramir can be controlled in the Osgiliath level where you need to defend the city against battalions of orcs and afterwards defend the ring bearer Frodo until he reaches the city limits. He makes a guest hero appearance twice in The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age. As with Conquest Faramir appears to help you during the Osgiliath level and helps the party take on the Orc leader Gothmog. Faramir is featured as a playable character in Lego Lord of the Rings, in a similar role to that played in the Jackson films.

Tarbé (Reims, 1850), p. l. The Roman de Renart attributed a poem about Tristan to a certain Chievre de Reins, who may be Robert. This attribution led Wilhelm Mann to conclude that he was active before 1300, though other scholars have argued on linguistic grounds that he must have been writing later. Nine songs are attributed to Robert and \\"no fewer than four have their first stanza enhanced by a liturgical tenor in a motet appearing anonymously in a polyphonic source\\".Saint-Cricq, Gaël. \\"Genre, Attribution and Authorship in the Thirteenth Century: Robert de Reims vs ‘Robert de Rains’.\\" Early Music History 38 (2019): 141-213 at 147.

It was Microsoft's first product (as Micro-Soft), distributed by MITS under a contract. Altair BASIC was the start of the Microsoft BASIC product range.  Origin and development  Bill Gates recalls that, when he and Paul Allen read about the Altair in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, they understood that the price of computers would soon drop to the point that selling software for them would be a profitable business. \\"While walking through Harvard Square one day, Allen spotted the Popular Electronics cover that features the Altair. ... Allen ran to tell Bill that he thought their big break had finally come. Bill agreed.\\" Gates believed that, by providing a BASIC interpreter for the new computer, they could make it more attractive to hobbyists. They contacted MITS founder Ed Roberts, told him that they were developing an interpreter, and asked whether he would like to see a demonstration. This followed the questionable engineering industry practice of a trial balloon, an announcement of a non-existent product to gauge interest. Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration in a few weeks, in March 1975. Gates and Allen had neither an interpreter nor even an Altair system on which to develop and test one. However, Allen had written an Intel 8008 emulator for their previous venture, Traf-O-Data, that ran on a PDP-10 time-sharing computer. Allen adapted this emulator based on the Altair programmer guide, and they developed and tested the interpreter on Harvard's PDP-10. Harvard officials were not pleased when they found out, but there was no written policy that covered the use of this computer. Gates and Allen bought computer time from a timesharing service in Boston to complete their BASIC program debugging. When fellow Harvard student Monte Davidoff stated he believed the system should use floating-point arithmetic instead of the integer arithmetic of the original versions, and claimed he could write such a system that could still fit within the memory limits, they hired Davidoff to write the package. The finished interpreter, including its own I/O system and line editor, fit in only four kilobytes of memory, leaving plenty of room for the interpreted program. In preparation for the demo, they stored the finished interpreter on a punched tape that the Altair could read, and Paul Allen flew to Albuquerque. While on final approach into the Albuquerque airport, Allen realized that they had forgotten to write a bootstrap program to read the tape into memory. Writing in 8080 machine language, Allen finished the program before the plane landed. Only when they loaded the program onto an Altair and saw a prompt asking for the system's memory size did Gates and Allen know that their interpreter worked on the Altair hardware. Later, they made a bet on who could write the shortest bootstrap program, and Gates won.  Versions and distribution  Altair 8K BASIC on paper tape Roberts agreed to distribute the interpreter. He also hired Gates and Allen to maintain and improve it, causing Gates to take a leave of absence from Harvard. The original version would retroactively be known as 4K BASIC when they added upgraded versions, including 8K BASIC, Extended BASIC, Extended ROM BASIC, and Disk BASIC. The smallest version, 4K BASIC, could run within a 4k RAM machine, leaving only about 790 bytes free for program code. In order to fit the language into such a small space, the 4K version lacked string manipulation and a number of common mathematical functions. These were added into the 8K BASIC version, which had string variables and manipulation functions, a larger set of math functions including \`RND\` for random numbers, Boolean operators, and \`PEEK\` and \`POKE\`. The 8K version is the basis for most versions of BASIC during the home computer era. Extended BASIC added \`PRINT USING\` and basic disk commands, while Disk BASIC further extended the disk commands to allow raw I/O. In October 1975, 4K BASIC sold for $150, 8K BASIC for $200, and Extended BASIC for $350 (equivalent to $, $, and $ in , respectively). The prices were discounted to $60, $75, and $150 respectively for those who purchased \\"8K of Altair memory, and an Altair I/O board\\". The language versions were distributed on paper tape or cassette tape.Altair Basic for the 6800 , In January 1978 I purchased Altair 680 Basic from Computer Kits in Berkeley CA. I paid full price, $200, I didn't want Bill Gates to go broke. If you bought an Altair 680B kit with 16 K of RAM for $685 you would get BASIC for free., Michael Holley's SWTPC Collection Home Page As they expected, the Altair was very popular with hobbyists such as the Homebrew Computer Club. Altair BASIC, as MITS' preferred BASIC interpreter, was also popular. However, the hobbyists took a \\"share-alike\\" approach to software and thought nothing of copying the BASIC interpreter for other hobbyists. Homebrew member Dan Sokol was especially prolific; after somehow obtaining a pre-market tape of the interpreter, he made 25 copies and distributed them at the next Homebrew meeting, urging recipients to make more copies. Gates responded in 1976 with a strongly worded Open Letter to Hobbyists that accused the copiers of theft and declared that he could not continue developing computer software that people did not pay for. Many hobbyists reacted defensively to the letter. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, MITS would receive the rights to the interpreter after it had paid a certain amount in royalties. However, Microsoft had developed versions of the interpreter for other systems such as the Motorola 6800. When they decided to leave MITS, a dispute arose over whether the full amount had been paid and whether the agreement applied to the other versions. Microsoft and MITS took the dispute to an arbitrator who, much to Roberts' surprise, decided in favor of Microsoft based on MITS failure to market the software with their \\"best efforts\\". BASIC interpreters remained the core of Microsoft's business until the early 1980s, when it shifted to MS-DOS.  See also  * Microsoft Binary Format  References  Further reading   Cringely, Robert X..

Internet television in Australia is the digital distribution of movies and television content via the Internet. In Australia, internet television is provided by a number of generalist, subscription-based streaming service providers, in addition to several niche providers that focus on specific genres. Australia's five major free-to-air television networks also all offer catch up TV of previously broadcast content to watch via their webpages and apps, and a number of ISPs and other companies offer IPTV – the live streaming of television channels sourced from Australia and elsewhere. A feature of Internet television is that a user can view live television or video on demand. Some distributors provide content as downloads, while other only allow streaming; the main difference being that with downloads the end-user must have storage capacity for the content on their device and must wait for the download to be completed before the content can be viewed, whereas streamed content can be viewed almost immediately, but is not stored for a later viewing. Whether downloaded or streamed, video files over the Internet are sometimes metered in Australia, with ISPs setting download quotas which can limit the downloads that a subscriber can make without incurring additional costs. Many ISPs now also provide plans with unlimited downloads. Some ISPs offer downloads on a quota-free basis for partnered television services, which is also known as \\"unmetered\\" content.  Catch up TV Services  Australia's five major free-to-air terrestrial television networks all offer catch up TV which enable viewers to stream previously broadcast content as well as the ability to live stream programs through their websites and applications. These catch up services use IP Address Geolocation to attempt to ensure only Australian users can view the content. The names given by the free-to-air networks to their catch up services are: * The Australian Broadcasting Corporation — iview, which launched on the 24 July 2008. * The Special Broadcasting Service — SBS on demand, which launched on the 1 September 2011. * The Seven Network — 7plus, which launched on 27 November 2017. * The Nine Network — 9Now, which launched on 27 January 2016. * Network 10 — 10 Play, which launched on 29 September 2013.

The service is now called Microsoft Films and TV. Regulation Internet television in Australia is regulated by the Australian Federal Government, through its powers to regulate telecommunications and levy taxes, and through the laws of the Australian states and territories. In 2015, the Australian Government moved to make digital goods subject to the Goods and Services Tax. Screen Australia and the Australian Communications and Media Authority proposed in 2020 the adoption of a new model of media regulation in Australia that would treat traditional, and more regulated, forms of media in similar ways to newer, and less regulated, forms of media. Options suggested included: imposing revenue-based quotas for local content production on streaming companies (as well as the entire sector); voluntary investment undertakings by streaming companies while maintaining the pre-existing quota system; or a relative deregulation of the media sector in its entirety.

As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.  Origin  Lacquerware is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and at some point may have been combined with as a replacement for other ceramic repair techniques. While the process is associated with Japanese craftsmen, the technique was also applied to ceramic pieces of other origins including China, Vietnam, and Korea. became closely associated with ceramic vessels used for (Japanese tea ceremony). One theory is that may have originated when Japanese shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent a damaged Chinese tea bowl back to China for repairs in the late 15th century. When it was returned, repaired with ugly metal staples, it may have prompted Japanese craftsmen to look for a more aesthetic means of repair. Collectors became so enamored of the new art that some were accused of deliberately smashing valuable pottery so it could be repaired with the gold seams of . On the other hand, according to Bakōhan Saōki (record of tea-bowl with a 'large-locust' clamp), such \\"ugliness\\" was inspirational and Zen in a way as it connotes beauty in broken things. The bowl became valued even more highly because of these large metal staples, which looked like a locust and the bowl was named Bakōhan (large- locust clamp).http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100886  Philosophy  As a philosophy, can be seen to have similarities to the Japanese philosophy of , an embracing of the flawed or imperfect. Japanese aesthetics values marks of wear by the use of an object. This can be seen as a rationale for keeping an object around even after it has broken and as a justification of itself, highlighting the cracks and repairs as simply an event in the life of an object rather than allowing its service to end at the time of its damage or breakage, and can be seen as a variant of the adage \\"Waste not, want not\\". can relate to the Japanese philosophy of , which encompasses the concepts of non- attachment, acceptance of change, and fate as aspects of human life.Flickwerk The Aesthetics of Mended Japanese Ceramics Paperback, January 1, 2008 by Christy, James Henry Holland and Charly Iten Bartlett  Types of joinery  There are a few major styles or types of : * , the use of gold dust and resin or lacquer to attach broken pieces with minimal overlap or fill-in from missing pieces * , where a replacement ceramic fragment is not available and the entirety of the addition is gold or gold/lacquer compound * , where a similarly shaped but non-matching fragment is used to replace a missing piece from the original vessel creating a patchwork effect  Related techniques  Nanking reticulated basket, c. 1750, mended with metal staples Staple repair is a similar technique used to repair broken ceramic pieces, where small holes are drilled on either side of a crack and metal staples are bent to hold the pieces together. Staple repair was used in Europe (in ancient Greece, England and Russia among others) and China as a repair technique for particularly valuable pieces.  Influence on modern art  is the general concept of highlighting or emphasizing imperfections, visualizing mends and seams as an additive or an area to celebrate or focus on, rather than absence or missing pieces. Modern artists experiment with the ancient technique as a means of analyzing the idea of loss, synthesis, and improvement through destruction and repair or rebirth. While originally ignored as a separate art form, and related repair methods have been featured at exhibitions at the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Herbert F.

The manga is licensed for a French-language release in France, a German-language release in Germany and an Italian-language release by Panini Comics. Summary At the start of the series, the Republic of Regium is engaged in a costly war with the Federation of Dragnov. Dragnov wanted to reunify the two countries, but Regium was bitterly opposed to this and mobilized their army instead. In part due to winter conditions, the Regium forces had the upper hand at the start of the war, but gradually the Dragnov forces came close to overrunning Regium's last line of defence around the capital of Solgrenne, until Dragnov launched a new missile that caused serious damage to the capital despite being detonated indirectly 8 km outside the city, which convinced the Regium politicians to negotiate for a surrender, although the Regium Third Army refused to surrender and continued fighting. The story follows Captain Grahad Mills, commander of the Regium special forces \\"Jackal\\" unit, that utilizes the most advanced SAA(Special Assault Armor) in existence. With the last line of defense faltering, the Jackals are deployed in a last-ditch attempt to hold the line, and succeeded at destroying all opponents in their sector. Unexpectedly though, Mills's subordinates all frame him for the murder of several Regium soldiers, causing him to be sentenced for execution. Mills then escapes from Prison, and tracks down the old members of the Jackals, trying to find out why they betrayed him. The story's conflict takes place approximately in Eastern European countries such as Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Bulgaria, who however have drastically changed in theirs names and territories, since it is eventually revealed that the story takes place approximately several centuries in the future after a devastating World War, and the reason many nations use former American & NATO weaponry is because the United States had previously subjugated the world under a one world order controlled by itself. In fact, in the comic-universe the United States succeeded in the Strategic Defence Initiative program (SDI), therefore making the US invulnerable to ICBM attacks, as result the Cold War came to an end when the Soviet Union fell in the mid-eighties. However, the US continued their military programs eventually succeeding in the construction of the first laser strategic weapon, reducing a city to cinders in seconds. With this huge power the United States create in 2001 the D.U.P.E. (the Democratic Union for Peace on Earth) a super-state with its territory that encompass the entire continent of Asia (except most of the Middle East and Turkey), Oceania and America(except Canada). As consequence of the DUPE formation, the European Union is transformed into a continental state from the previous European Nato countries but, the EU remain a second-rate power compare to the DUPE. The year 2001 became the new first year of the new era, known as 1 GU (first year of the Great Unification's calendar), however in 50 GU (2050 AD) an unknown power is able to hack in the SDI system, forcing the system in SafeMode, making the system unable to process order from the DUPE command centre (except its original mission to intercept any launched ICBMs and missiles). As result of losing its deterrence system, the other countries of the planet launch a full-scale attack against the DUPE forces, beginning the \\"20 years war\\" (World War III) that ended de facto in 70 GU (2070 AD) with no winner and the death of half the population of the planet, while all main actors of the war eventually dissolved and ceased to exist following the mutual destruction. Nations and alliances are created, formed and destroyed in the course of the war and after, one of them is the Regimu Kingdom, a new state that incorporate the former nation of Ukraine, Poland, Slovack, Romania and Bulgaria, but in 87 GU (2087 AD) a nationalist revolt result in the fall of the monarchy and the creation of the Regium Republic(former Romania and Bulgaria), while the remaining three states remain independent until 129 GU (2129 AD) when the countries decide to form the Dragnov Federation. In 179 GU (2179 AD) the Dragnov Federation and the Regium Republic go to war against each other which last until 182 GU (2182 AD), with the loss of 2 million soldiers for the Federation and 2.2 million soldiers and 8 million civilians for the Republic, when the Federation is able to launch a new type of missile against the Republic which is undetectable from the SDI satellites, that are still carrying on their original mission after 110 years. CharactersJackals= Although there are eight Jackals in total, including Mills, oddly enough no mention of the missing eighth member is made when Mills asks both Waldmann and Lenny for information on the other members of the Jackals. Captain Grahalt Mills Nicknamed \\"Genocide\\" for destroying superior amounts of Dragnov troops alone, he prefers to work alone on the battlefield. He is a master of all forms of combat, managing to escape from a high security prison while killing the special forces soldiers who were guarding him. In the beginning swear vengeance against those who have betrayed him, but later decide to join the Third Army, feeling his original mission not complete and that he has a better chance to expose Krayz's plan. Lieutenant Julian Krayz Mills's second in command, he organized a mutiny because the Dragnov forces were winning and he wanted to be on the winning side. When assigned to eliminate enemy forces, he also killed friendly Regium soldiers and used their deaths to frame Mills as a traitor that attempted to defect to Dragnov. After the war, he became Colonel in the Dragnov armed forces as well as remaining as a lieutenant in the Regium forces, effectively drawing pay from two armies. He's later reveal that he's an actual descendant of the Regimu Kingdom royal dynasty and he want to use the war to recreate the Regimu Kingdom, for this purpose he's also trying to gain access to the D.U.P.E. satellite network, thinking he's found a viable \\"key\\" to the system. Captain Waldmann Became Captain of the GIGN's(Regium's SWAT) 1st armored unit after the war. A proudy but, ambitious soldier, before the war ending, he had attempted to kill Mills by asking a homeless boy to give Mills a booby trapped package, but Mills survived and became Captain of the Jackals instead, a position that would have gone to Waldmann if Mills had died. Betrayed Mills because he felt that Regium had lost the war, and because he failed to kill Mills previously. Eventually killed by Mills after apologizing. Lieutenant Lenny Kruger Was once wounded by a sniper and Mills took two rounds for him, saving his life. Betrayed Mills because Krayz was using his sister, Leila, as a hostage, who became his subourdinate after the war. He later fight against Mills, but he's clear he has no intention to kill him and once been defeated by Mills, he beg Mills to kill him feeling unworthy, however Mills forgive him of his betrayal and \\"order\\" him to join Mills' group, he later return to be Mills trusted aide and second command and a valutable soldiers in the Third Army. Lars Odd A famous sniper during the war, used a sniper variant of the Swashbuckler. He sent his sick brother to a military hospital for treatment, and it is implied that Krayz used him as a hostage to get Lars to betray Mills. His brother died anyway, and Lars quit the army to live in the mountains, swearing never to kill again. He later decided to temporary withdraw his promise to help Mills reach the Regium Third Army, but he died in a sniping operation against a Dragnovian turret that was preventing Mills from crossing the mountains, managing to fire a round down the barrel of the turret, but taking a direct hit from the gun in the process. Klaus Gadon Betrayed Mills because he wanted the war to end, but then later joined the Third Army and became in charge of supply and logistics. Responsible for feeding Krayz information about Mills's activities. Rod Sterioni Joined the Third Army after the war, but has not been seen since he tried to get Lars to join him in the Third Army. He is later reveal that he actually leave the Army to join Krayz's plan and that he originally wanted to use Lars to kill the commander-in-chief of the Dragnov forces in Regium, but he's later able to complete himself the mission, sneaking in the Dragnov occupation forces headquarters and executing the commander-in-chief, masked as a cleaner. =Others=Saya Hamilton A homeless woman that stayed in the same derelict building that Mills used as a bait to lure Waldmann. Insisted on staying with Mills afterwards. Her hometown was being evacuated at the end of the war when trigger happy Dragnovian troops blew up a refugee truck that was carrying her family and friends. Colonel Classad A hero of Regium, he was the commander of the Ranger Regiment, an inter service special forces unit. He recruited Mills when he was working as a pump attendant at a gas station, when ordinarily only elite members of the military would have been selected. Near the end of the training, Colonel Classad led a rebellion involving several platoons of active duty Rangers to seize the SAA at the training camp, the rebels' intention was to start a war with Dragnov as they were dismayed by the government's lack of honor and willingness to give in to Dragnov in regards to territorial demands. Classad however deliberately forced a confrontation with Mills and forced Mills to shoot him after a lengthy battle, which transformed him into the killing machine \\"Genocide\\". Mills then wiped out the other rebels single-handedly. Lieutenant Leila Kruger Sister of Lenny Kruger, and adjutant of Krayz, whom she has an intimate relationship with. Colonel Leon Ridas Strategist of the Third Army, with uncharacteristic unkempt hair. Largely responsible for the Third Army's success so far, and partly responsible for the \\"Miracle of Lent\\", wherein Ridas directed the eight members of the Jackals, commanded by Mills, and held off an entire Dragnovian armored division for 2 days. Technology Most aspects of technology in RedEye are fairly similar to that of the current modern world. Tanks are armed with 120 mm cannons, infantry generally uses rifles, machine guns and grenades. The major exception is the development of powered armor called SAA. Ballistic missiles have fallen out of use because old military satellites launched by the previous superpower destroy anything that reaches a high-enough altitude. A new missile launched by Dragnov used a new propellant that left no heat signature, preventing satellite detection. =Special Assault Armor= SAA (Special Assault Armor) are powered armor suits that protects the wearer against most weapons up to 20 mm (however it still has weak spots such as actuators, joints and unarmored portions around the face), and has a power source capable of sustaining it for eight hours of continuous combat. SAA troops are generally armed with a 12.7 mm machine gun and underslung grenade launcher, although the advanced models used by the Jackals feature cannons and anti-tank missile launchers. In a pinch, SAA may be operated via remote control. Ayriel Gainer Industries (Regium Republic) APF-175 \\"Bardish\\" : The mass production SAA used by the Regium Armored units during the war.

Playing careerEarly days= Luckett was born in St Helens, Lancashire and played his early football with Skelmersdale United, from where he had an unsuccessful trial with Liverpool. =Southampton= In August 1927, shortly before his 24th birthday, he joined Southampton, then in the Second Division. He made a \\"spectacular\\" first-team debut came on 21 January 1928, when he scored twice from the right-wing in a 5–1 home victory over Notts County. He retained his place for the next two matches, before Bill Henderson returned from injury. Later in the season, Luckett made three appearances at outside-left, replacing the injured Stan Cribb. In the next season, Luckett's first-team chances were restricted by the form of Stan Woodhouse at left-half, and his five appearances came in four different positions as the \\"Saints\\" had their best season since joining the Second Division in 1922, finishing fourth in the table. In 1929–30, Luckett made 12 appearances, generally standing in for Woodhouse, who was beginning to suffer from injury at frequent intervals. For the early part of the 1930–31 season, Luckett made only a handful of appearances, before injury to Woodhouse again earned Luckett a recall at left-half. Described as \\"not a particularly skilful player (who) had a voracious appetite for work\\", Luckett \\"would chase around the pitch like a terrier\\". He now began to make the left-half position his own, eventually forcing manager George Kay to switch Woodhouse to the right. Luckett was \\"ever-present\\" in 1932–33, playing at left-half until mid- February, before being pushed forward to outside-left to replace Johnny Arnold who had been transferred to Fulham along with Michael Keeping. Luckett scored five goals from the left-wing, including two in a 3–1 victory over Burnley on 15 April. Luckett missed the start of the 1933–34 season and with Woodhouse back at left-half, he replaced Fred Tully (who had been signed to replace John Arnold) at outside-left, before Tully returned in December. Luckett eventually regained his place at left-half in early March. With age now catching up on Woodhouse, Luckett retained the No. 6 shirt for 1934–35 only missing four matches as the Saints struggled both on and off the pitch, finishing only two places above the relegation zone and needing two borrow £200 from the Supporters Club to help finance the summer wage bill. Luckett made 18 appearances at the start of the 1935–36 season, before an ankle injury put him out for several months, with Woodhouse once again replacing him. After two attempts at a return to first-team action, Luckett retired in the summer of 1937, having made 219 appearances over ten years, scoring 10 goals. Coaching career After retiring from playing at the age of 34, Luckett joined Cowes Sports as a player-coach, remaining with the Isle of Wight club up to the start of World War II. During the war, he joined the Royal Air Force where he became a Physical Training instructor at RAF Ford. Whilst at Ford, he spotted the potential of Eric Day and recommended him to the Saints. After the war, Luckett returned to The Dell, spending seven years as the trainer for the reserve and \\"A\\" teams. He then had a brief spell, from September 1954 to January 1955 as manager at Andover. He was the landlord of the Salisbury Arms at Christchurch before the war, and after the war was the landlord of the Juniper Berry in Southampton. He continued to play Sunday football into his 60s, turning out for the Ordnance Survey in 1964. In his retirement, Luckett lived in Shirley, Southampton where he died in July 1985.

A week later Mark Ross of the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust contacted Stuart Weir from the Democratic Audit, Anthony Barnett from openDemocracy's OurKingdom and Peter Facey from Unlock Democracy, and suggested they organize a major public meeting and news coverage about the issue Davis raised. The campaign was founded by Henry Porter, London editor of Vanity Fair, and Anthony Barnett, a founding member of Charter 88. It was sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, openDemocracy, Liberty (UK), NO2ID, and The Guardian. In February 2009, the Convention organised the largest civil liberties gathering ever held in the UK, with meetings of journalists, lawyers, politicians, and campaigners. Speakers included Shami Chakrabarti, Marina Warner, Fatima Bhutto, Timothy Garton Ash, Clive Stafford Smith, Helena Kennedy, and Joanne Cash.McCrum, Robert.

Debrecen 1547), was a Protestant Reformer who has been called the \\"Luther of Hungary\\". Life Plaque to Matthias Devai Biro, quadrangle of Wittenberg University Dévai was born in Déva in Transylvania in eastern Hungary around 1500. He was later called \\"Devai\\" or \\"Dévay\\" because he was from Déva. He may have studied with Simon Grynaeus, the first Hungarian proponent of the Protestant Reformation, at Buda. The University of Cracow listed him as a student there in 1523. After two years of study, he was ordained as a priest and monk in the Roman Catholic Church. Sometime between 1527 and 1529, Dévay became a supporter of the Protestant Reformation, and in 1529, he traveled to the University of Wittenberg to study under Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. As Luther's student, Dévay lived in Luther's house, a common practice in those days. The house and the student rooms are preserved in Wittenberg. He returned to Buda by 1531, becoming the minister of a Protestant congregation. Protestant ideas were able to flourish in Hungary at this time because there had been a general breakdown in church discipline after virtually all Hungarian bishops were killed at the Battle of Mohács (1526) and the Kingdom of Hungary in general was in disarray. During his time in Buda, Dévay wrote a work denouncing prayer to saints. He also published 52 propositions explaining the Protestant position. Biro convinced members of the Batthyány and Bocskay families to support the Reformation. The Hungarian Reformation under Biro's leadership came to resemble the position later known as Calvinism. Hungarian Protestants came to distinguish between their faith, which they called Magyar hit (Hungarian faith), from what they called Nemes hit (German faith) (i.e. Lutheranism). Dévay soon left Buda to become minister at Košice. He was soon arrested by Thomas Szalaházy, bishop of Erlau, a close adviser to King Ferdinand I of Hungary. He was imprisoned first at Likavka, then at Bratislava, then at Vienna. He was tried before Johann Faber, Bishop of Vienna, another close adviser of Ferdinand, and a committed opponent of the Reformation. Biro was released soon after his trial, and returned to Buda where he resumed his work as a reformer. In 1532, he was re-arrested, and remained in prison until 1534. Upon his release from prison, Dévay came under the protection of Tamás I Nádasdy. Dévay devoted his time to refuting the works of Gregory Szegedy, a doctor of the Sorbonne and provincial superior of the Franciscans in Hungary, who had written in opposition to the Reformation. Dévay wrote Orthographica Hungarica', the first book published in Hungarian. In spite of King Ferdinand's opposition to the Reformation, Dévay supported Ferdinand's claim to the throne as opposed to his rival János Szapolyai, who was supported by the Ottoman Empire. The civil war between Ferdinand and János Szapolyai ultimately drove Miro from Hungary. He traveled to the court of George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, bearing a letter of introduction from Philipp Melanchthon. From there, he traveled to Switzerland, where he adopted the view of the framers of the First Helvetic Confession on the topic of the Lord's Supper. After returning to Hungary, Dévay was a zealous advocate of the Reformed position on the Lord's Supper, and denounced the Lutheran position. In 1544, the ministers of Sárvár complained to Martin Luther of the doctrine being taught by his former student, and Luther denounced Dévay's position as an abomination that he would fight against. In Hungary, Dévay settled in Debrecen under the protection of one of Nádasdy's relatives. During this time, he wrote expositions of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, and the Nicene Creed in the Hungarian language for the common man.

It can be an acquired taste, but is one of the many soups that are an important part of the Polish cooking. Along with bigos, żurek, and pierogi, it is one of the most notable specialities in Polish cuisine. Its name is derived from its main ingredient: thin, cleaned strips of beef tripe (in - which can also be literally translated to \\"guts\\").  Etymology  The Polish name , literally meaning \\"guts\\" being the plural of (\\"guts\\"), came from German (\\"spot\\"), from Middle High German Old High German , from Proto-Germanic *flekka- (\\"spot/mark\\"). , the diminutive of , is also used to refer to tripe soups in Poland. Croatian is a cognate. German names for tripe soups include and (\\"tripe soup\\"), as well as and (\\"sour tripes\\"), as the words , , and can all mean \\"tripe\\".  History  Jean-Pierre Norblin Flaki has been consumed on Polish territory since the 14th century. It was one of favorite dishes of King Władysław II Jagiełło.  Preparation and serving  The method of preparation may vary slightly depending on the region. Some common ingredients include beef tripe, beef, bay leaf, parsley, carrot, beef broth, and spices to taste, including salt, black pepper, nutmeg, sweet paprika, and marjoram. Ready-made convenience-type equivalents of the labor-intensive flaczki are available. Sometimes pork tripe can be used instead of the beef tripe especially in the ready-made versions of the dish sold in Poland. Tomato concentrate is sometimes added to flaki, and some may cook the tripe without a roux. A popular addition to improve the 'nobleness' is the addition of meatballs, which are often found in a regional variant known as 'flaki po warszawsku' (Warsaw-style flaki). Ready-made flaki in cans or jars are widely available in grocery stores throughout Poland which also include \\"Flaki po Zamojsku\\" (Zamość-style Flaki). A variant of flaczki, in which fowl stomach is used instead of cow’s, is also known and called ‘flaki drobiowe’ (poultry flaki). The soup is traditionally served during Polish weddings – as one of the \\"hot meals\\". Flaki is eaten with fresh bread, usually with bread roll.

On the wedding day of Nixon's daughter, Tricia, attended by both Agnew and comedian Bob Hope, Agnew appeared in Los Angeles at an Army Ball honoring Hope. In his introduction to Hope, Agnew peppered his speech with many of Siller's one-liners. They included jokes about the wedding. Hope, following Agnew on the dais, had to cross out from his own monologue the topical references that Agnew had just delivered. Hope asked his nephew, Peter Malatesta, at the time Agnew's aide, “Who the hell wrote those jokes?” When Malatesta informed him it was Ray Siller, Hope said, “Tell him he’s hired”. The following year, Siller relocated to California to begin a three-year stint at NBC Burbank on Hope's writing staff for The Bob Hope Specials. In 1972, he accompanied Hope on his final Christmas tour to Vietnam. In 1974, Siller left Hope to write for another NBC program, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.

Namhkam (; Shan: ; Tai Nuea: ᥘᥛᥳ ᥑᥛᥰ), also spelled Nam Kham is the principal town of Namhkam Township in northern Shan State, Myanmar, situated on the southern bank of the Shweli River near the border with Yunnan Province, China. History The region surrounding Namhkam originally belonged to China, but from 1894 to 1897, the British colonial administration in Burma built a road between this frontier town and Bhamo by the Ayeyarwady River in Kachin State for a distance of . The road was intended to be used by Chinese muleteers for the benefit of border trade. The town was rented to the British in 1897 by the Qing Dynasty (similar to the New Territories of Hong Kong). The area became formally part of Burma in 1960 when China and Burma signed a border treaty and swapped territory along their border. During the Second World War, the Allies built the Ledo Road, stretching from Ledo in Assam, India to Kunming, China, across northern Burma. By the end of 1944, the road stretched to Namhkam, linking up with the old Burma Road at Bhamo. In 2005, the Shan State Army - South attempted to fill a power vacuum in Namhkam left by the 1989 ceasefire agreement between their counterparts in the north and the Burmese military, but their attempt was promptly thwarted. The governments of Myanmar and China have been working to resolve a border dispute in the area of Namhkam and Muse since 2014. Education As of 2017, there are two high schools, three middle schools, 100 primary schools and one monastic school in Namhkam. Agriculture Cultivation of the opium poppy in the area during British rule caused considerable deforestation, noted in 1920 east of a line from Lashio to Namhkam. A 2005 survey carried out by the Shan State Peace Council recorded 1,800 drug addicts in Namhkam alone, and community-run rehabilitation centers were set up to tackle the rising problem of addiction. The first of these facilities were constructed in 1998, but were declared illegal and forced to close down in 2000 by authorities. Buddhist monks and teachers in Namhkam are also involved in the amelioration of the HIV/AIDS issue amongst drug users. Hsinshweli high yield hybrid rice cultivation has been promoted in recent years by authorities in the region. Development Myanmar and China signed a contract in August 2003 for the construction of the hydroelectric Shweli I Dam on the Shweli River near Namhkam, aiming to supply electricity to Kyaukme, Hsipaw, Lashio and Namtu. It was completed in 2009 and has a 600 MW installed capacity. Notable people Burmese American Dr. Gordon Seagrave, famously known as the \\"Burma Surgeon\\", ran the American missionary hospital overlooking Namhkam. He was believed to have had military intelligence duties as well as medical ones, and he later wrote articles on his experience in Namhkam.

In 1972, H. K.

It is obtained by a mix of five stains: alcian blue, Verhoeff hematoxylin, crocein scarlet combined with acidic fuchsine and saffron. At pH 2.5, alcian blue is fixed by electrostatic binding with the acidic mucopolysaccharides. The Verhoeff hematoxylin has a high affinity for nuclei and elastin fibers, negatively charged. The combination of crocein scarlet with acidic fuchsine stains acidophilic tissue components in red.

It is based on the use of fuzzy logic and fuzzy numbers for the creation of the possible pay-off distribution of a project (real option). The structure of the method is similar to the probability theory based Datar–Mathews method for real option valuation,Datar, V. & Mathews, S. 2004. European Real Options: An Intuitive Algorithm for the Black Scholes Formula. Journal of Applied Finance, 14(1)Mathews, S. & Datar, V. 2007. A Practical Method for Valuing Real Options: The Boeing Approach. Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, 19(2): 95–104. but the method is not based on probability theory and uses fuzzy numbers and possibility theory in framing the real option valuation problem. Method The Fuzzy pay-off method derives the real option value from a pay- off distribution that is created by using three or four cash-flow scenarios (most often created by an expert or a group of experts). The pay-off distribution is created simply by assigning each of the three cash-flow scenarios a corresponding definition with regards to a fuzzy number (triangular fuzzy number for three scenarios and a trapezoidal fuzzy number for four scenarios). This means that the pay-off distribution is created without any simulation whatsoever. This makes the procedure easy and transparent. The scenarios used are a minimum possible scenario (the lowest possible outcome), the maximum possible scenario (the highest possible outcome) and a best estimate (most likely to happen scenario) that is mapped as a fully possible scenario with a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes, or in the case of four scenarios used - two best estimate scenarios that are the upper and lower limit of the interval that is assigned a full degree of membership in the set of possible outcomes. The main observations that lie behind the model for deriving the real option value are the following: # The fuzzy NPV of a project is (equal to) the pay-off distribution of a project value that is calculated with fuzzy numbers. # The mean value of the positive values of the fuzzy NPV is the \\"possibilistic\\" mean value of the positive fuzzy NPV values. # Real option value, ROV, calculated from the fuzzy NPV is the \\"possibilistic\\" mean valueFuller, R. & Majlender, P. 2003. On weighted possibilistic mean and variance of fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 136: 363–374. of the positive fuzzy NPV values multiplied with the positive area of the fuzzy NPV over the total area of the fuzzy NPV. The real option formula can then be written simply as: : \\\\mathrm{ROV} = \\\\frac{A(\\\\mathrm{Pos})}{A(\\\\mathrm{Pos})+A(\\\\mathrm{Neg})} \\\\times E[A_+] ::where A(Pos) is the area of the positive part of the fuzzy distribution, A(Neg) is the area of the negative part of the fuzzy distribution, and E[A+] is the mean value of the positive part of the distribution. It can be seen that when the distribution is totally positive, the real options value reduces to the expected (mean) value, E[A+]. As can be seen, the real option value can be derived directly from the fuzzy NPV, without simulation. At the same time, simulation is not an absolutely necessary step in the Datar–Mathews method, so the two methods are not very different in that respect. But what is totally different is that the Datar–Mathews method is based on probability theory and as such has a very different foundation from the pay-off method that is based on possibility theory: the way that the two models treat uncertainty is fundamentally different. Use of the method The pay-off method for real option valuation is very easy to use compared to the other real option valuation methods and it can be used with the most commonly used spreadsheet software without any add-ins. The method is useful in analyses for decision making regarding investments that have an uncertain future, and especially so if the underlying data is in the form of cash-flow scenarios. The method is less useful if optimal timing is the objective. The method is flexible and accommodates easily both one-stage investments and multi-stage investments (compound real options). The method has been taken into use in some large international industrial companies for the valuation of research and development projects and portfolios.Heikkilä, M., 2009, Selection of R&D; Portfolios of Real Options with Fuzzy Pay-offs under Bounded Rationality, IAMSR Research Report, 1/2009, In these analyses triangular fuzzy numbers are used. Other uses of the method so far are, for example, R&D; project valuation IPR valuation, valuation of M&A; targets and expected synergies,Kinnunen, J., 2010, Valuing M&A; Synergies as (Fuzzy) Real Options, 14th Annual International Conference on Real Options in Rome, Italy, June 16–19, 2010 valuation and optimization of M&A; strategies, valuation of area development (construction) projects, valuation of large industrial real investments. The use of the pay-off method is lately taught within the larger framework of real options, for example at the Lappeenranta University of Technology and at the Tampere University of Technology in Finland.

It was licensed by ADV but is now licensed by a division of ADV, SoftCel Pictures in United States. On April 22, 2003, SoftCel Pictures released the 2 OVA episodes on a DVD. Other releases include May 30, 2006 by Critical Mass, and April 13, 2010 by Kitty Media. PlotOVA 1= Kayuga, a Goddess of Love, looks at the moon from her residence in a limbo dimension between it and Earth. She and her faithful servant Pipi note that mankind's various sorrows are slowly but surely pushing the moon away from the planet. Kayuga decides the only way to stop this is for her and Pipi to go to Earth and save the moon by helping the anguished attain and achieve what they desire the most. As they arrive on Earth, Tanaka, a young luckless romantic, attempts to surprise his dream girl, the wealthy Ikuko, with a bouquet of flowers and tickets to a baseball game for her birthday. Ikuko, however, harshly rejects Tanaka's attempts, claiming she has no interest in him (or men in general) at all and berates him for making such plans without her consent. She then tells him to never contact her or come by her place again, before running off, leaving Tanaka devastated and heartbroken over her rejection, which Kayuga and Pipi witness. Ikuko then makes her way to the apartment of her lover and governess, Dr. Manami Shibata, whom she has become absolutely devoted to since they had sex after their first meeting, who suggests a dinner outing to celebrate Ikuko's birthday. Unbeknownst to her, Manami has grown tired of her and Ikuko's love affair, due to both Ikuko's clinginess and because she has become engaged to a fellow male doctor from her hospital, Akihiro Okabe. However, she does not wish to break off their relationship, as Ikuko has included Manami in her will. To that end, Manami conspires to murder Ikuko and disguise it as an accident in order to be rid of her, keep her inheritance, and marry Okabe. Before they go out to dinner, Manami injects Ikuko with egg yolk, disguising it as a booster shot, which both Kayuga and Pipi witness. They then bring a still-distraught Tanaka (stopping him from impulsively committing suicide in the process) and bring him to the restaurant to see Ikuko and Manami together, which enrages him so much that he dashes off in a blind rage and has to be retrieved by Pipi. Meanwhile, Ikuko eats a dish that Manami ordered for her; unknown to her, the dish contains eggs, which due to the egg yolk shot given to her by Manami earlier, causes her to collapse from anaphylactic shock, which everyone sees as an allergic reaction to the dish. Ikuko is rushed to Manami's hospital at the latter's instruction, with Tanaka returning just in time to see her off, much to his distress. As Ikuko lies in intensive care, Manami rendezvous with Okabe and the two share a kiss. Unknown to them, Kayuga witnesses this. She then takes Ikuko's soul to her dimension and to the Bridge of Dreams, which Pipi instructs that she must cross without looking back to achieve her greatest desire. When asked what her said desire is, Ikuko, still unaware of Manami's murderous plot, says that she hopes Manami will love her even in death. Kayuga tries to convince her to ask for something else, but Ikuko's devotion to her doctor is too strong; in her protest, Ikuko turns around before fully crossing and is spirited away from the bridge. Back on Earth, Kayuga expresses disappointment in Ikuko's choice and asks Tanaka if he still wishes to help her. Tanaka confirms this, and Kayuga and Pipi then show him Manami's affair with Dr. Okabe, upsetting Tanaka. Manami then goes to Ikuko's room and injects her IV with more egg yolk, thus spelling her demise for certain. Back in Kayuga's dimension, she properly introduces herself and tries again to make Ikuko see sense, but Ikuko refuses to listen. Kayuga then takes her back to the real world and reveals Manami's relationship with Dr. Okabe by showing them having passionate sex, and exposes Manami's evil intentions by causing her to have a waking dream in which Okabe points out Manami's murder plot and Manami is haunted by Ikuko's ghost. Finally seeing the truth, Ikuko breaks down, heartbroken over Manami's betrayal, before Kayuga returns with her to her dimension. Elsewhere, Pipi attempts to comfort an enraged and drunken Tanaka, who swears he'll do anything to avenge Ikuko. Kayuga arrives and decides to grant him his wish by transforming him into a girl. She then encourages him to figure out what to do with his new body before leaving him. The next day, the still-female Tanaka goes to Okabe's office and is able to use his new body to briefly seduce him before Manami interrupts them. He then does so again successfully after encountering Okabe again on the doctor's jogging route. Back in Kayuga's dimension, Ikuko continues to cry over Manami's betrayal and the belief that nobody loves her. But Kaguya proves her otherwise by showing her how far Tanaka was willing to go (even changing his gender) to avenge Ikuko, even after her previous rejection of him; Ikuko is left touched at his devotion. Back on Earth, Ikuko's funeral ends and her body is taken to be cremated at Manami's instruction, in order to erase all evidence of her crime. Pipi sees this and rushes off. Meanwhile, at Okabe's apartment, he and Tanaka are about to have sex, but Tanaka stops him, reminding him of his engagement to Manami; to his surprise, Okabe brushes off Manami as nothing to him, not knowing that Manami is listening right outside his door. Manami then storms in, and catches the two together; but just as she does, Kayuga uses her powers to transform Tanaka back into a guy – at least in Manami's eyes, causing her to think that Okabe is having a gay affair. When Okabe (who still only sees Tanaka as a girl) proclaims that Tanaka is his true love, Manami, shocked and disgusted, storms out in utter disbelief. Okabe then turns to pounce on Tanaka, only for him (now a male again) to knock the doctor out cold. Kayuga then reappears, and offers Tanaka the chance to remain a girl (with the promise of endless orgasms), which Tanaka is enticed by. Before he can choose, Pipi pops in and tells them of Ikuko's impending cremation, causing Tanaka to run to the crematorium (wearing only his girl-form's panties). He fights his way to Ikuko's coffin, and rips the top off, causing a burst of magical energy that transports Tanaka to Kayuga's dimension and the Bridge of Dreams. He crosses the bridge without looking back and is reunited with Ikuko's soul. Ikuko apologizes to Tanaka and thanks him for loving her. The two share their first kiss, and are propelled back to Earth, where Ikuko returns to life and embraces Tanaka. Later, Tanaka and Ikuko seduce each other in an amusement park Ferris Wheel as Kayuga and Pipi watch before leaving for their next mission. =OVA 2= In her home dimension, just as she finishes her bath, Kayuga starts feeling intense emotions tremors emitting from the Earth's inhabitants. Determined once again to stop the world's hardships from driving away the moon, she and Pipi return to Earth to locate the source of the tremors. Disguised as a fortune teller, she attempts to bring in some of the unfortunate-in-love people, with little to no success, until a young geeky boy named Satoshi finds a promo discarded by the girlfriend of a prospective customer. Reading it, he decides to pay Kayuga a visit. Upon arriving, Satoshi becomes enamored by Kayuga's body. She then begins her analysis of him, and concludes that he has a lot of pent up sexual tension that he wishes to act on within, but something is holding him back from following through and letting out his true feelings. She also concludes that this has caused much friction in his relationship with his girlfriend Mika. Kaguya then attempts to get Satoshi to loosen up by using her body, but only succeeds in putting him in a frozen, grinning semi-comatose state that is only broken by Pipi's attempt to give him mouth-to-mouth. He then rushes out to meet Mika. However, the meeting soon goes sour: Mika angrily expresses her frustration with Satoshi, that he constantly takes her to boring, nerdy places (such as video game stores and the planetarium) on their dates, and refuses to make love or any romantic moves or gestures (even holding her hand) towards her. When Satoshi continues making weak excuses, Mika loses her temper and insults him (calling him \\"clueless, boring, immature, and probably impotent\\"), before breaking off their relationship and walking away. Devastated, Satoshi stands in disbelief as it starts to rain, before screaming in frustration and running home crying. Kayuga and Pipi witness this, and express disappointment over Satoshi blowing his chance, before deciding to return to their mission. Meanwhile, Satoshi returns home, and rejects his father's offer of a new dish for dinner. Later, he plays a video game furiously, as he vents his frustration over losing Mika; as he plays, his frustration soon becomes insane laughter, and upon getting a \\"Game Over\\", he suddenly falls into the same semi-comatose state as before. Satoshi is soon discovered by his father and rushed to the hospital. Kaguya and Pipi, having traced the despairing tremors to Satoshi's neighborhood, witness this and soon trace the tremors to his video game. Transporting themselves inside it, the two realize that Satoshi's soul is trapped inside the game; Kaguya theorizes that the great shock, stress, and devastation over being dumped by Mika, combined with his own inner frustrations, left Satoshi so unbalanced that his soul departed from his body and was trapped in the game's software. Kayuga and Pipi are then force to battle through the game's enemies, including a tentacle monster embedded with the most repressed part of Satoshi's soul, which Pipi manages to defeat, thus freeing Satoshi's soul. In the process, they briefly enter Satoshi's mind and are treated to a memory of Satoshi's mother leaving him as a young boy. The two then realize that this is what has been holding Satoshi back: his mother's abandonment was so devastating that it left him emotionally stunted and unable to bring himself to make moves on girls, out of fear that he'd make the wrong move and be abandoned again. At this, Kayuga decides to give Satoshi the \\"nurturing\\" he has lacked over the years. At the hospital, where Satoshi has returned to normal (though still unconscious), Kayuga and Pipi take him through a happier memory with his mother, where she explains the constellations to him (thus explaining his fixation with stars). Kayuga then allows him to suck on her breasts, thus \\"nurturing\\" him like a mother and allowing him to emotionally develop and gain the potential to move forward. To that end, she then takes him to the Bridge of Dreams, where he crosses without looking back, allowing Kayuga to help him achieve his goal. Satoshi then finds himself in the form of water – in Mika's bathtub. As Mika gets into the water, Satoshi covertly feels her up, causing her to jump out of the tub. Kayuga then transforms Satoshi into a corporeal form and encourages him to finally touch her the way he's dreamed of this whole time. Entranced by Mika's body, Satoshi does so and discovers that Mika can feel (though not see) him; according to Kayuga, this proves that she still loves him and regrets her previous insults and breaking up with him, which she expresses as Satoshi feels her up more and more. Kayuga then makes Satoshi visible to her for a second before leaving with him, causing Mika to brush it off as a steam hallucination. The next morning at the hospital, in Satoshi's room, his father sadly expresses his self-perceived failure to being a good father and fill in the gap left in his son's heart since his wife's departure. However, Satoshi then wakes up (to his father's surprise and happiness) and debunks this, citing with a newfound confidence that he no longer needs his mother's missing love anymore and can move forward. Soon after, Mika arrives and apologizes to Satoshi for insulting and dumping him, and the two happily reconcile. Later on, a newly confident Satoshi takes Mika on another date, with plans to go to a love hotel to finally consummate their relationship, much to her delight. Kayuga and Pipi then head off again, as a narrator explains Kayuga's purpose in the world, as the episode ends. Characters *Kaguya is the main protagonist of the series.

The novel was originally published in 2002 in France as Les mots étrangers, where it was short-listed for the Renaudot Prize and the Interallié Prize. It was then translated by the author and was published in 2004 as Oi xenes lexeis in Greece, where it won the prize for best Greek novel of the year. The English translation Foreign Words was done by Alyson Waters and was published by Autumn Hill Books in 2006.  Background  Vassilis Alexakis, like his protagonist Nicolaides, is a Greek writer who relocated to France, writing and translating between his native and adopted languages. The inspiration for Foreign Words comes from his own experience studying Sango after the death of his father in 1995. Foreign Words, published by Autumn Hill Books in 2006, is Alexakis’ first work to appear in English. It was published in the US with help from the National Endowment for the Arts as well as the French ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the United States.  Plot summary  Foreign Words tells the story of Nicolaides, a Greek writer living in Paris, whose father has recently died. His latest novel has not done well in France, and he has not been writing anything new. He decides he wants to learn a new language, a little-known African language. After being introduced to linguists Paul-Marie and Mathilde Bourquin, Nicolaides settles on Sango, spoken in the Central African Republic (CAR), as his choice. With the help of a dictionary and a textbook, Nicolaides happily delves into his study of Sango, his obsession somewhat like infatuation. It gives him, as he says, “the agreeable illusion that I can start anew.” He can put together sentences such as Baba ti mbi a kui (“my father is dead”) without feeling sad. However, as his relationship deepens and he grows closer to Sango, he can no longer find solace in its words and phrases. The example sentences in his dictionary begin to give him pause, sentences such as “I don’t even have enough money to buy salt,” and “Grandmother, why are you crying like that?” Around this time Nicolaides meets a native of the CAR (and co-author of the Sango dictionary), Marcel Alingbindo, and his family. Marcel is eager for Nicolaides’ aid in resuscitating Sango, which is being pushed out by French down in the CAR. Marcel explains his process of introducing neologisms into Sango, and urges Nicolaides to become its advocate. It is around this time that Nicolaides ends up arranging a trip to Bangui, the capital of the CAR. In the interim, he returns home to Athens, Greece, to deal with his parents’ estate. He then travels to Bangui to experience what he has only fantasized—conversations with real people, the trips he has only traced on maps, walks along the Oubangi River that was the birthplace of Sango. He is also planted smack in the middle of poverty and political unrest. He meets with writers, students, and politicians to discuss the state of Sango. What can be done to save it? Is it even worth saving? Nicolaides, even at the end of the book, does not decide what, if anything, he will do.  Main characters  Nicolaides is the protagonist and narrator of Foreign Words. He is a Greek novelist living in France who writes in both French and Greek and translates between them. The year the story takes place, Nicolaides’ father has died. His father has left behind a letter for Nicolaides, written not by him but by his father (Nicolaides’ grandfather), and throughout the novel Nicolaides struggles with whether or not he will read this letter. What he does do is embark on a study of the Sango language. Georges is Nicolaides’ French publisher. It is later revealed that he has an adopted daughter from Africa. Jean Fergusson is Nicolaides’ friend, an ethnologist and journalist who is battling skin cancer when the main action of the novel takes place. He has a relationship with a woman named Sandra, with whom he conceives a child and marries. Alice is a married woman with whom Nicolaides has an on-again, off-again affair. In one scene she comes over to his apartment and seems to demonstrate jealousy toward his infatuation with Sango. Paul-Marie and Mathilde Bourquin are an older married couple of linguists Nicolaides meets through his friend Jean Fergusson. They are the ones who introduce him to Sango and give him a dictionary, which was co-written by Mathilde. Marcel Alingbindo is a native of the CAR living in France with his wife and some of his children, although he has other children who are still back in Africa. He is invested in teaching Sango as well as enriching it through the use of neologisms. He teaches Nicolaides about the use of tones in Sango and how messages can be communicated through whistling, if done correctly. Esther is a young, attractive waitress at a restaurant in Bangui. Nicolaides wonders if she is a pupulenge, (“slut”). He would like to sleep with her, but never does.  Significant locations  * Paris and other parts of France * Athens, Greece * Bangui, Central African Republic  Major themes  Loss and aging – Foreign Words tells the story of a man working through the grief of losing his father. Throughout the novel, narrator Nicolaides reflects on his relationship with his father (and also his mother, who died before). He even carries out imaginary conversations with his father. Nicolaides also has to grapple with the fact that he himself is aging. Language – Intertwined with the other themes of the book is the permeating idea of language, old languages and new, how they can blend together or how one can dominate another (such as the relationship between French and Sango in the CAR). Of course, the idea of finding oneself anew in a new language is also illustrated through Nicolaides’ experience—as well as finding the same old self once the novelty has worn off.

They are among the 200 small monogenetic volcanoes found along the Macolod Corridor, a rift zone between Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw, which is part of the larger Southwestern Luzon Volcanic Field. These craters are formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions, an eruption where ground water comes in contact with hot magma pushing up near the Earth's surface. Petrographic Analysis In a recent rocks and sediment analysis or petrographic study on the lakes and adjoining rivers in San Pablo, sulfate concentrations were considerably higher than the naturally occurring sulfates from volcanism. Samples were taken from other areas underlain with similar volcanic rocks from the old eruptions (e.g. Taal volcano) like Indang, in the province of Cavite and the La Mesa Watershed, the water supply reservoir for Metropolitan Manila. The analyses indicated that the elevated level of sulfates were not related to volcanism but anthropogenic or man-made, and among the causes are sewage, fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides etc. Hiking trails In 2005, the Rotary Club of San Pablo City held a ceremony that officially opened the hiking trails that connect the seven lakes of the city.

Rugby career Blake was first capped for Wales during the 1899 Home Nations Championship in the opening game against England. The selectors made multiple changes to the team that finished the previous season, with only six players returning to the squad from that game. Blake was one of five new caps to be brought into the pack, while the Swansea half-back pairing of Evan and David James returned into the team after their reinstatement to the rugby union code. The game was a massive loss for England, with Wales running in six tries, four by Willie Llewellyn. The selectors kept faith with Blake for the rest of the tournament, but Welsh fortunes dropped after the England game, with a loss to Scotland and Ireland. Blake was back in the Wales team for the entirety of the 1900 Championship under the captaincy of Welsh sporting icon Billy Bancroft. Wales won all three matches and won the Triple Crown for the second time in the country's history. The next season the selectors tried to keep the nucleus of the Championship winning team together and hopes were high that the Welsh team could repeat the last season's feat and retake the Triple Crown.

This includes studying genomes of pathogens which cannot be cultured outside of a host. In the past, researchers and medical professionals found it difficult to study and understand pathogenic traits of infectious organisms. With newer technology, pathogen genomes can be identified and sequenced in a much shorter time and at a lower cost, thus improving the ability to diagnose, treat, and even predict and prevent pathogenic infections and disease. It has also allowed researchers to better understand genome evolution events - gene loss, gain, duplication, rearrangement - and how those events impact pathogen resistance and ability to cause disease. This influx of information has created a need for making the vast amounts of data accessible to researchers in the form of databases, and it has raised ethical questions about the wisdom of reconstructing previously extinct and deadly pathogens in order to better understand virulence. History During the earlier times when genomics was being studied, scientists found it challenging to sequence genetic information. The field began to explode in 1977 when Fred Sanger, PhD, along with his colleagues, sequenced the DNA-based genome of a bacteriophage, using a method now known as the Sanger Method. The Sanger Method for sequencing DNA exponentially advanced molecular biology and directly led to the ability to sequence genomes of other organisms, including the complete human genome. The Haemophilus influenza genome was one of the first organism genomes sequenced in 1995 by J. Craig Venter and Hamilton Smith using whole genome shotgun sequencing. Since then, newer and more efficient high- throughput sequencing, such as Next Generation Genomic Sequencing (NGS) and Single-Cell Genomic Sequencing, have been developed. While the Sanger method is able to sequence one DNA fragment at a time, NGS technology can sequence thousands of sequences at a time. With the ability to rapidly sequence DNA, new insights developed, such as the discovery that since prokaryotic genomes are more diverse than originally thought, it is necessary to sequence multiple strains in a species rather than only a few. E.coli was an example of why this is important, with genes encoding virulence factors in two strains of the species differing by at least thirty percent. Such knowledge, along with more thorough study of genome gain, loss, and change, is giving researchers valuable insight into how pathogens interact in host environments and how they are able to infect hosts and cause disease. With this high influx of new information, there has arisen a higher demand for bioinformatics so scientists can properly analyze the new data. In response, software and other tools have been developed for this purpose. Also, as of 2008, the amount of stored sequences was doubling every 18 months, making urgent the need for better ways to organize data and aid research. In response, thousands of publicly accessible databases and other resources have been created, including the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) of pathogenic bacteria, which was established in 2004 and was created to aid in pathogenomics research.  Microbe analysis  Pathogens may be prokaryotic (archaea or bacteria), single-celled eukarya or viruses. Prokaryotic genomes have typically been easier to sequence due to smaller genome size compared to Eukarya. Due to this, there is a bias in reporting pathogenic bacterial behavior. Regardless of this bias in reporting, many of the dynamic genomic events are similar across all the types of pathogen organisms. Genomic evolution occurs via gene gain, gene loss, and genome rearrangement, and these \\"events\\" are observed in multiple pathogen genomes, with some bacterial pathogens experiencing all three. Pathogenomics does not focus exclusively on understanding pathogen-host interactions, however. Insight of individual or cooperative pathogen behavior provides knowledge into the development or inheritance of pathogen virulence factors. Through a deeper understanding of the small sub-units that cause infection, it may be possible to develop novel therapeutics that are efficient and cost- effective. = Cause and analysis of genomic diversity = Dynamic genomes with high plasticity are necessary to allow pathogens, especially bacteria, to survive in changing environments. With the assistance of high throughput sequencing methods and in silico technologies, it is possible to detect, compare and catalogue many of these dynamic genomic events. Genomic diversity is important when detecting and treating a pathogen since these events can change the function and structure of the pathogen. There is a need to analyze more than a single genome sequence of a pathogen species to understand pathogen mechanisms. Comparative genomics is a methodology which allows scientists to compare the genomes of different species and strains. There are several examples of successful comparative genomics studies, among them the analysis of Listeria and Escherichia coli. Some studies have attempted to address the difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes. This inquiry proves to be difficult, however, since a single bacterial species can have many strains, and the genomic content of each of these strains varies.  Evolutionary dynamics  Varying microbe strains and genomic content are caused by different forces, including three specific evolutionary events which have an impact on pathogen resistance and ability to cause disease, a: gene gain, gene loss, and genome rearrangement. = Gene loss and genome decay = Gene loss occurs when genes are deleted. The reason why this occurs is still not fully understood, though it most likely involves adaptation to a new environment or ecological niche. Some researchers believe gene loss may actually increase fitness and survival among pathogens. In a new environment, some genes may become unnecessary for survival, and so mutations are eventually \\"allowed\\" on those genes until they become inactive \\"pseudogenes.\\" These pseudogenes are observed in organisms such as Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enterica, and Yersinia pestis. Over time, the pseudogenes are deleted, and the organisms become fully dependent on their host as either endosymbionts or obligate intracellular pathogens, as is seen in Buchnera, Myobacterium leprae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. These deleted genes are also called Anti-virulence genes (AVG) since it is thought they may have prevented the organism from becoming pathogenic. In order to be more virulent, infect a host and remain alive, the pathogen had to get rid of those AVGs. The reverse process can happen as well, as was seen during analysis of Listeria strains, which showed that a reduced genome size led to a non-pathogenic Listeria strain from a pathogenic strain. Systems have been developed to detect these pseudogenes/AVGs in a genome sequence. Summary of dynamic genomics events = Gene gain and duplication = One of the key forces driving gene gain is thought to be horizontal (lateral) gene transfer (LGT). It is of particular interest in microbial studies because these mobile genetic elements may introduce virulence factors into a new genome. A comparative study conducted by Gill et al. in 2005 postulated that LGT may have been the cause for pathogen variations between Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus. There still, however, remains skepticism about the frequency of LGT, its identification, and its impact. New and improved methodologies have been engaged, especially in the study of phylogenetics, to validate the presence and effect of LGT. Gene gain and gene duplication events are balanced by gene loss, such that despite their dynamic nature, the genome of a bacterial species remains approximately the same size. = Genome rearrangement = Mobile genetic insertion sequences can play a role in genome rearrangement activities. Pathogens that do not live in an isolated environment have been found to contain a large number of insertion sequence elements and various repetitive segments of DNA. The combination of these two genetic elements is thought help mediate homologous recombination. There are pathogens, such as Burkholderia mallei, and Burkholderia pseudomallei which have been shown to exhibit genome-wide rearrangements due to insertion sequences and repetitive DNA segments. At this time, no studies demonstrate genome-wide rearrangement events directly giving rise to pathogenic behavior in a microbe. This does not mean it is not possible. Genome-wide rearrangements do, however, contribute to the plasticity of bacterial genome, which may prime the conditions for other factors to introduce, or lose, virulence factors. = Single-nucleotide polymorphisms = Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, or SNPs, allow for a wide array of genetic variation among humans as well as pathogens. They allow researchers to estimate a variety of factors: the effects of environmental toxins, how different treatment methods affect the body, and what causes someone's predisposition to illnesses. SNPs play a key role in understanding how and why mutations occur. SNPs also allows for scientists to map genomes and analyze genetic information.  Pan and core genomes  Pan-genome overview Pan-genome overview The most recent definition of a bacterial species comes from the pre-genomic era. In 1987, it was proposed that bacterial strains showing >70% DNA·DNA re-association and sharing characteristic phenotypic traits should be considered to be strains of the same species. The diversity within pathogen genomes makes it difficult to identify the total number of genes that are associated within all strains of a pathogen species. It has been thought that the total number of genes associated with a single pathogen species may be unlimited, although some groups are attempting to derive a more empirical value. For this reason, it was necessary to introduce the concept of pan-genomes and core genomes. Pan-genome and core genome literature also tends to have a bias towards reporting on prokaryotic pathogenic organisms. Caution may need to be exercised when extending the definition of a pan-genome or a core-genome to the other pathogenic organisms because there is no formal evidence of the properties of these pan-genomes. A core genome is the set of genes found across all strains of a pathogen species. A pan-genome is the entire gene pool for that pathogen species, and includes genes that are not shared by all strains. Pan-genomes may be open or closed depending on whether comparative analysis of multiple strains reveals no new genes (closed) or many new genes (open) compared to the core genome for that pathogen species. In the open pan-genome, genes may be further characterized as dispensable or strain specific. Dispensable genes are those found in more than one strain, but not in all strains, of a pathogen species. Strain specific genes are those found only in one strain of a pathogen species. The differences in pan-genomes are reflections of the life style of the organism. For example, Streptococcus agalactiae, which exists in diverse biological niches, has a broader pan-genome when compared with the more environmentally isolated Bacillus anthracis. Comparative genomics approaches are also being used to understand more about the pan-genome. Recent discoveries show that the number of new species continue to grow with an estimated 1031 bacteriophages on the planet with those bacteriophages infecting 1024 others per second, the continuous flow of genetic material being exchanged is difficult to imagine.  Virulence factors  Multiple genetic elements of human-affecting pathogens contribute to the transfer of virulence factors: plasmids, pathogenicity island, prophages, bacteriophages, transposons, and integrative and conjugative elements. Pathogenicity islands and their detection are the focus of several bioinformatics efforts involved in pathogenomics. It is a common belief that \\"environmental bacterial strains\\" lack the capacity to harm or do damage to humans. However, recent studies show that bacteria from aquatic environments have acquired pathogenic strains through evolution. This allows for the bacteria to have a wider range in genetic traits and can cause a potential threat to humans from which there is more resistance towards antibiotics. = Microbe-microbe interactions = Staphylococcus aureus biofilm Microbe-host interactions tend to overshadow the consideration of microbe-microbe interactions. Microbe-microbe interactions though can lead to chronic states of infirmity that are difficult to understand and treat.  Biofilms  Biofilms are an example of microbe- microbe interactions and are thought to be associated with up to 80% of human infections. Recently it has been shown that there are specific genes and cell surface proteins involved in the formation of biofilm. These genes and also surface proteins may be characterized through in silico methods to form an expression profile of biofilm-interacting bacteria. This expression profile may be used in subsequent analysis of other microbes to predict biofilm microbe behaviour, or to understand how to dismantle biofilm formation.  Host microbe analysis  Pathogens have the ability to adapt and manipulate host cells, taking full advantage of a host cell's cellular processes and mechanisms. A microbe may be influenced by hosts to either adapt to its new environment or learn to evade it. An insight into these behaviours will provide beneficial insight for potential therapeutics. The most detailed outline of host-microbe interaction initiatives is outlined by the Pathogenomics European Research Agenda. Its report emphasizes the following features: Summary of host-microbe project goals in the Pathogenomics European Research Agenda * Microarray analysis of host and microbe gene expression during infection. This is important for identifying the expression of virulence factors that allow a pathogen to survive a host's defense mechanism. Pathogens tend to undergo an assortment of changed in order to subvert and hosts immune system, in some case favoring a hyper variable genome state. The genomic expression studies will be complemented with protein-protein interaction networks studies. * Using RNA interference (RNAi) to identify host cell functions in response to infections. Infection depends on the balance between the characteristics of the host cell and the pathogen cell. In some cases, there can be an overactive host response to infection, such as in meningitis, which can overwhelm the host's body. Using RNA, it will be possible to more clearly identify how a host cell defends itself during times of acute or chronic infection. This has also been applied successfully is Drosophila. * Not all microbe interactions in host environment are malicious. Commensal flora, which exists in various environments in animals and humans may actually help combating microbial infections. The human flora, such as the gut for example, is home to a myriad of microbes. The diverse community within the gut has been heralded to be vital for human health. There are a number of projects under way to better understand the ecosystems of the gut. The sequence of commensal Escherichia coli strain SE11, for example, has already been determined from the faecal matter of a healthy human and promises to be the first of many studies. Through genomic analysis and also subsequent protein analysis, a better understanding of the beneficial properties of commensal flora will be investigated in hopes of understanding how to build a better therapeutic. = Eco-evo perspective = The \\"eco-evo\\" perspective on pathogen-host interactions emphasizes the influences ecology and the environment on pathogen evolution. The dynamic genomic factors such as gene loss, gene gain and genome rearrangement, are all strongly influenced by changes in the ecological niche where a particular microbial strain resides. Microbes may switch from being pathogenic and non-pathogenic due to changing environments. This was demonstrated during studies of the plague, Yersinia pestis, which apparently evolved from a mild gastrointestinal pathogen to a very highly pathogenic microbe through dynamic genomic events. In order for colonization to occur, there must be changes in biochemical makeup to aid survival in a variety of environments. This is most likely due to a mechanism allowing the cell to sense changes within the environment, thus influencing change in gene expression. Understanding how these strain changes occur from being low or non-pathogenic to being highly pathogenic and vice versa may aid in developing novel therapeutics for microbial infections.  Applications  Baby Receiving Immunizations Human health has greatly improved and the mortality rate has declined substantially since the second world war because of improved hygiene due to changing public health regulations, as well as more readily available vaccines and antibiotics. Pathogenomics will allow scientists to expand what they know about pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes, thus allowing for new and improved vaccines. Pathogenomics also has wider implication, including preventing bioterrorism. = Reverse vaccinology = Reverse vaccinology is relatively new. While research is still being conducted, there have been breakthroughs with pathogens such as Streptococcus and Meningitis. Methods of vaccine production, such as biochemical and serological, are laborious and unreliable.They require the pathogens to be in vitro to be effective. New advances in genomic development help predict nearly all variations of pathogens, thus making advances for vaccines. Protein-based vaccines are being developed to combat resistant pathogens such as Staphylococcus and Chlamydia. = Countering bioterrorism = In 2005, the sequence of the 1918 Spanish influenza was completed. Accompanied with phylogenetic analysis, it was possible to supply a detailed account of the virus' evolution and behavior, in particular its adaptation to humans. Following the sequencing of the Spanish influenza, the pathogen was also reconstructed. When inserted into mice, the pathogen proved to be incredibly deadly. The 2001 anthrax attacks shed light on the possibility of bioterrorism as being more of a real than imagined threat. Bioterrorism was anticipated in the Iraq war, with soldiers being inoculated for a smallpox attack. Using technologies and insight gained from reconstruction of the Spanish influenza, it may be possible to prevent future deadly planted outbreaks of disease. There is a strong ethical concern however, as to whether the resurrection of old viruses is necessary and whether it does more harm than good. The best avenue for countering such threats is coordinating with organizations which provide immunizations. The increased awareness and participation would greatly decrease the effectiveness of a potential epidemic. An addition to this measure would be to monitor natural water reservoirs as a basis to prevent an attack or outbreak. Overall, communication between labs and large organizations, such as Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), can lead to early detection and prevent outbreaks.

They are generally produced in the process of alpha decay, but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the Greek alphabet, α. The symbol for the alpha particle is α or α2+. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as or indicating a helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle becomes a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom . Alpha particles, like helium nuclei, have a net spin of zero. Due to the mechanism of their production in standard alpha radioactive decay, alpha particles generally have a kinetic energy of about 5 MeV, and a velocity in the vicinity of 4% the speed of light. (See discussion below for the limits of these figures in alpha decay.) They are a highly ionizing form of particle radiation, and (when resulting from radioactive alpha decay) usually have low penetration depth (stopped by a few centimeters of air, or by the skin). However, so-called long range alpha particles from ternary fission are three times as energetic, and penetrate three times as far. The helium nuclei that form 10–12% of cosmic rays are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and are thus capable of being highly penetrating and able to traverse the human body and also many meters of dense solid shielding, depending on their energy. To a lesser extent, this is also true of very high-energy helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators. Name Some science authors use doubly ionized helium nuclei () and alpha particles as interchangeable terms. The nomenclature is not well defined, and thus not all high-velocity helium nuclei are considered by all authors to be alpha particles. As with beta and gamma particles/rays, the name used for the particle carries some mild connotations about its production process and energy, but these are not rigorously applied. Thus, alpha particles may be loosely used as a term when referring to stellar helium nuclei reactions (for example the alpha processes), and even when they occur as components of cosmic rays. A higher energy version of alphas than produced in alpha decay is a common product of an uncommon nuclear fission result called ternary fission. However, helium nuclei produced by particle accelerators (cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and the like) are less likely to be referred to as \\"alpha particles\\". Sources of alpha particlesAlpha decay= A physicist observes alpha particles from the decay of a polonium source in a cloud chamberAlpha radiation detected in an isopropanol cloud chamber (after injection of an artificial source radon-220). The best-known source of alpha particles is alpha decay of heavier (> 106 u atomic weight) atoms. When an atom emits an alpha particle in alpha decay, the atom's mass number decreases by four due to the loss of the four nucleons in the alpha particle. The atomic number of the atom goes down by exactly two, as a result of the loss of two protons – the atom becomes a new element. Examples of this sort of nuclear transmutation are when uranium becomes thorium, or radium becomes radon gas, due to alpha decay. Alpha particles are commonly emitted by all of the larger radioactive nuclei such as uranium, thorium, actinium, and radium, as well as the transuranic elements. Unlike other types of decay, alpha decay as a process must have a minimum-size atomic nucleus that can support it. The smallest nuclei that have to date been found to be capable of alpha emission are beryllium-8 and the lightest nuclides of tellurium (element 52), with mass numbers between 104 and 109. The process of alpha decay sometimes leaves the nucleus in an excited state, wherein the emission of a gamma ray then removes the excess energy. Mechanism of production in alpha decay In contrast to beta decay, the fundamental interactions responsible for alpha decay are a balance between the electromagnetic force and nuclear force. Alpha decay results from the Coulomb repulsion between the alpha particle and the rest of the nucleus, which both have a positive electric charge, but which is kept in check by the nuclear force. In classical physics, alpha particles do not have enough energy to escape the potential well from the strong force inside the nucleus (this well involves escaping the strong force to go up one side of the well, which is followed by the electromagnetic force causing a repulsive push- off down the other side). However, the quantum tunnelling effect allows alphas to escape even though they do not have enough energy to overcome the nuclear force. This is allowed by the wave nature of matter, which allows the alpha particle to spend some of its time in a region so far from the nucleus that the potential from the repulsive electromagnetic force has fully compensated for the attraction of the nuclear force. From this point, alpha particles can escape, and in quantum mechanics, after a certain time, they do so. =Ternary fission= Especially energetic alpha particles deriving from a nuclear process are produced in the relatively rare (one in a few hundred) nuclear fission process of ternary fission. In this process, three charged particles are produced from the event instead of the normal two, with the smallest of the charged particles most probably (90% probability) being an alpha particle. Such alpha particles are termed \\"long range alphas\\" since at their typical energy of 16 MeV, they are at far higher energy than is ever produced by alpha decay. Ternary fission happens in both neutron-induced fission (the nuclear reaction that happens in a nuclear reactor), and also when fissionable and fissile actinides nuclides (i.e., heavy atoms capable of fission) undergo spontaneous fission as a form of radioactive decay. In both induced and spontaneous fission, the higher energies available in heavy nuclei result in long range alphas of higher energy than those from alpha decay. =Accelerators= Energetic helium nuclei may be produced by cyclotrons, synchrotrons, and other particle accelerators, but they are not normally referred to as \\"alpha particles.\\" =Solar core reactions= As noted, helium nuclei may participate in nuclear reactions in stars, and occasionally and historically these have been referred to as alpha reactions (see for example triple alpha process). =Cosmic rays= In addition, extremely high energy helium nuclei sometimes referred to as alpha particles make up about 10 to 12% of cosmic rays. The mechanisms of cosmic ray production continue to be debated. Energy and absorption The energy of the alpha particle emitted in alpha decay is mildly dependent on the half-life for the emission process, with many orders of magnitude differences in half-life being associated with energy changes of less than 50%. The energy of alpha particles emitted varies, with higher energy alpha particles being emitted from larger nuclei, but most alpha particles have energies of between 3 and 7 MeV (mega-electron-volts), corresponding to extremely long and extremely short half-lives of alpha- emitting nuclides, respectively. With a typical kinetic energy of 5 MeV; the speed of emitted alpha particles is 15,000 km/s, which is 5% of the speed of light. This energy is a substantial amount of energy for a single particle, but their high mass means alpha particles have a lower speed than any other common type of radiation, e.g. β particles, neutrons.N.B. Since gamma rays are electromagnetic (light) they move at the speed of light (c). Beta particles often move at a large fraction of c, and exceed 60% c whenever their energy is > 64 keV, which it commonly is. Neutron velocity from nuclear reactions ranges from about 6% c for fission to as much as 17% c for fusion. Because of their charge and large mass, alpha particles are easily absorbed by materials, and they can travel only a few centimetres in air. They can be absorbed by tissue paper or by the outer layers of human skin. They typically penetrate skin about 40 micrometres, equivalent to a few cells deep. Biological effects Due to the short range of absorption and inability to penetrate the outer layers of skin, alpha particles are not, in general, dangerous to life unless the source is ingested or inhaled. Because of this high mass and strong absorption, if alpha-emitting radionuclides do enter the body (upon being inhaled, ingested, or injected, as with the use of Thorotrast for high-quality X-ray images prior to the 1950s), alpha radiation is the most destructive form of ionizing radiation. It is the most strongly ionizing, and with large enough doses can cause any or all of the symptoms of radiation poisoning. It is estimated that chromosome damage from alpha particles is anywhere from 10 to 1000 times greater than that caused by an equivalent amount of gamma or beta radiation, with the average being set at 20 times. A study of European nuclear workers exposed internally to alpha radiation from plutonium and uranium found that when relative biological effectiveness is considered to be 20, the carcinogenic potential (in terms of lung cancer) of alpha radiation appears to be consistent with that reported for doses of external gamma radiation i.e. a given dose of alpha-particles inhaled presents the same risk as a 20-times higher dose of gamma radiation. The powerful alpha emitter polonium-210 (a milligram of 210Po emits as many alpha particles per second as 4.215 grams of 226Ra) is suspected of playing a role in lung cancer and bladder cancer related to tobacco smoking. 210Po was used to kill Russian dissident and ex- FSB officer Alexander V. Litvinenko in 2006. When alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest, due to the high relative biological effectiveness of alpha radiation to cause biological damage. Alpha radiation is an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in experiments with inhaled alpha emitters, up to 1000 times more dangerous than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes. History of discovery and use Alpha radiation consists of helium-4 nucleus and is readily stopped by a sheet of paper. Beta radiation, consisting of electrons, is halted by an aluminium plate. Gamma radiation is eventually absorbed as it penetrates a dense material. Lead is good at absorbing gamma radiation, due to its density. An alpha particle is deflected by a magnetic field Dispersing of alpha particles on a thin metal sheet In 1899, physicists Ernest Rutherford (working in McGill University in Montreal, Canada) and Paul Villard (working in Paris) separated radiation into three types: eventually named alpha, beta, and gamma by Rutherford, based on penetration of objects and deflection by a magnetic field.Rutherford distinguished and named α and β rays on page 116 of: E. Rutherford (1899) \\"Uranium radiation and the electrical conduction produced by it,\\" Philosophical Magazine, Series 5, vol. 47, no. 284, pages 109–163. Rutherford named γ rays on page 177 of: E. Rutherford (1903) \\"The magnetic and electric deviation of the easily absorbed rays from radium,\\" Philosophical Magazine, Series 6, vol. 5, no. 26, pages 177–187. Alpha rays were defined by Rutherford as those having the lowest penetration of ordinary objects. Rutherford's work also included measurements of the ratio of an alpha particle's mass to its charge, which led him to the hypothesis that alpha particles were doubly charged helium ions (later shown to be bare helium nuclei). In 1907, Ernest Rutherford and Thomas Royds finally proved that alpha particles were indeed helium ions.E. Rutherford and T. Royds (1908) \\"Spectrum of the radium emanation,\\" Philosophical Magazine, Series 6, vol. 16, pages 313–317. To do this they allowed alpha particles to penetrate a very thin glass wall of an evacuated tube, thus capturing a large number of the hypothesized helium ions inside the tube. They then caused an electric spark inside the tube, which provided a shower of electrons that were taken up by the ions to form neutral atoms of a gas. Subsequent study of the spectra of the resulting gas showed that it was helium and that the alpha particles were indeed the hypothesized helium ions. Because alpha particles occur naturally, but can have energy high enough to participate in a nuclear reaction, study of them led to much early knowledge of nuclear physics. Rutherford used alpha particles emitted by radium bromide to infer that J. J. Thomson's Plum pudding model of the atom was fundamentally flawed. In Rutherford's gold foil experiment conducted by his students Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, a narrow beam of alpha particles was established, passing through very thin (a few hundred atoms thick) gold foil. The alpha particles were detected by a zinc sulfide screen, which emits a flash of light upon an alpha particle collision. Rutherford hypothesized that, assuming the \\"plum pudding\\" model of the atom was correct, the positively charged alpha particles would be only slightly deflected, if at all, by the dispersed positive charge predicted. It was found that some of the alpha particles were deflected at much larger angles than expected (at a suggestion by Rutherford to check it) and some even bounced almost directly back. Although most of the alpha particles went straight through as expected, Rutherford commented that the few particles that were deflected was akin to shooting a fifteen-inch shell at tissue paper only to have it bounce off, again assuming the \\"plum pudding\\" theory was correct. It was determined that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a small area in its center, making the positive charge dense enough to deflect any positively charged alpha particles that came close to what was later termed the nucleus. Prior to this discovery, it was not known that alpha particles were themselves atomic nuclei, nor was the existence of protons or neutrons known. After this discovery, J.J. Thomson's \\"plum pudding\\" model was abandoned, and Rutherford's experiment led to the Bohr model and later the modern wave-mechanical model of the atom. Energy-loss (Bragg curve) in air for typical alpha particle emitted through radioactive decay. The trace of a single alpha particle obtained by nuclear physicist Wolfhart Willimczik with his spark chamber specially made for alpha particles. In 1917, Rutherford went on to use alpha particles to accidentally produce what he later understood as a directed nuclear transmutation of one element to another. Transmutation of elements from one to another had been understood since 1901 as a result of natural radioactive decay, but when Rutherford projected alpha particles from alpha decay into air, he discovered this produced a new type of radiation which proved to be hydrogen nuclei (Rutherford named these protons). Further experimentation showed the protons to be coming from the nitrogen component of air, and the reaction was deduced to be a transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen in the reaction :14N + α → 17O + p This was the first discovered nuclear reaction. To the adjacent pictures: According to the energy-loss curve by Bragg, it is recognizable that the alpha particle indeed loses more energy on the end of the trace.Magazine \\"nuclear energy\\" (III/18 (203) special edition, Volume 10, Issue 2 /1967. Anti-alpha particle In 2011, members of the international STAR collaboration using the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory detected the antimatter partner of the helium nucleus, also known as the anti-alpha. . See also The experiment used gold ions moving at nearly the speed of light and colliding head on to produce the antiparticle. Applications * Some smoke detectors contain a small amount of the alpha emitter americium-241. The alpha particles ionize air within a small gap. A small current is passed through that ionized air. Smoke particles from fire that enter the air gap reduce the current flow, sounding the alarm. The isotope is extremely dangerous if inhaled or ingested, but the danger is minimal if the source is kept sealed. Many municipalities have established programs to collect and dispose of old smoke detectors, to keep them out of the general waste stream. * Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators used for space probes and artificial heart pacemakers. Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay. Plutonium-238, a source of alpha particles, requires only 2.5 mm of lead shielding to protect against unwanted radiation. * Static eliminators typically use polonium-210, an alpha emitter, to ionize air, allowing the \\"static cling\\" to more rapidly dissipate. * Researchers are currently trying to use the damaging nature of alpha emitting radionuclides inside the body by directing small amounts towards a tumor. The alphas damage the tumor and stop its growth, while their small penetration depth prevents radiation damage of the surrounding healthy tissue. This type of cancer therapy is called unsealed source radiotherapy. Alpha radiation and DRAM errors In computer technology, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) \\"soft errors\\" were linked to alpha particles in 1978 in Intel's DRAM chips. The discovery led to strict control of radioactive elements in the packaging of semiconductor materials, and the problem is largely considered to be solved.

Another block shows boats in the marshes.Arnold: Middle Kingdom Tomb Architecture at Lisht, pl. 124 Rehuerdjersen is also known from an Abydos stela. However, based on stylistically reasons the stela was dated to the rule of Amenemhat II.R. Freed: Stela Workshops of Early Dynasty 12, in: Studies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson, Boston 1996, p. 327-334 The two different datings created some confusion over the dating of Rehuerdjersen. It seems possible that the tomb was built much later than when Amenemhat I was king, but the style of the reliefs in the mastaba seem to confirm an early date. Therefore it had been argued that either there were two treasurers with the same name or that the stela was set up after his death.

Elizabeth encouraged her husband in his rebellion, and persuaded him to attack the queen's troops at Aberdeen and there apprehend Queen Mary.Fraser, Mary, Queen of Scots, p. 229 with the purpose of forcing her into marriage with their son, Sir John.Fraser, Mary, Queen of Scots, p.225 On 22 October, at the Battle of Corrichie, Huntly and his men were defeated by Queen Mary's army led by James Stewart, Earl of Moray. Huntly died of apoplexy on the battlefield, while Elizabeth's sons John and Adam, themselves having actively participated in the rebellion and battle, were captured and shortly afterwards on 2 November, Sir John was executed by the orders of Queen Mary for treason. The life of seventeen-year-old Adam was spared as was that of George, Lord Gordon who had denied the queen entrance to the castle of Inverness where he held the post of sheriff; George, although pardoned, was nonetheless ordered to Dunbar Castle where he remained in custody until 1565 when his dignities were nominally restored to him. In 1563, the year following the Battle of Corrichie, Huntly's title and possessions were forfeited to the crown at a macabre session of Parliament with Queen Mary in attendance, in which his embalmed corpse was set up for all to see, and was pronounced guilty of treason and the sentence of forfeiture passed upon it.Fraser, Mary, Queen of Scots, p.230 Strathbogie Castle was duly stripped of its furnishings and these were sent to the queen's palace of Holyrood and to the Earl of Moray's new castle of Darnaway.Fraser, p.231 Among the Huntlys' confiscated belongings were elaborate tapestries, velvet-covered beds, hung with fringes of gold and silverwork, figures of animals, and vessels of gilded and coloured glass.Fraser, p.167 Later, as a token of the queen's clemency towards the Huntlys, Elizabeth and her second eldest daughter, Jean were given positions at the royal court. On 24 February 1566, Jean became the first wife of James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell who, following his divorce from Jean in 1567, would marry as her third husband, Mary, Queen of Scots. In March 1566, Elizabeth, who had by that time become a loyal adherent of Queen Mary, spent the night tending the queen, who was in her sixth month of pregnancy, at Holyrood Palace following the murder of David Rizzio. She devised various plans for Mary's escape which the latter rejected as having been impracticable. She finally managed to smuggle a letter to her son George, who also had become Mary's partisan, ordering him to stand by at Seton with a party of nobles to aid the queen on her journey to Dunbar Castle after she successfully escaped from the palace.Fraser, pp.292-293 Elizabeth Gordon died on an unknown date.

Football Gillespie was discovered by Jack Worrall when the Carlton coach saw him kicking the ball with some friends at Princes Park. He was used at full-back by Carlton and played in premiership teams in 1906 and 1907, his first two seasons. Gillespie missed out on being part of Carlton's third successive premiership in 1908 due to injury. He was embroiled in controversy during the 1910 VFL season when he was implicated in a bribery scandal at Carlton. Along with Alex Lang and Doug Fraser, Gillespie was dropped for the Semi Final against South Melbourne while the club and league investigated the allegations that they had been paid to play poorly. However, unlike his two teammates, Gillespie was exonerated and picked for the Grand Final. For the second year in a row he finished the premiership decider on the losing team. The full-back spent the 1911 football season with Brunswick in the VFA before returning to Carlton the following year where he made his tenth finals appearance before retiring. Out of Gillespie's 90 VFL matches at Carlton, he finished in the winning side 75 times. His twin brother David Francis Gillespie (1887-1917) also played at Carlton but was killed in World War I.

Gameplay  The goal of the game is to paint various objects. In each level the player is given an object with an attached rope which varies in length depending on the level. Using a mouse or touch screen and tilt controls, the player attempts to wrap the object with the rope. Each time the rope is laid down on the object, the area near the rope gets covered by paint. The challenge is getting the required percentage of an object painted with only a finite length of rope. There are three targets in each level - minimum, medium and maximum coverage. Some levels require nails protruding from the objects to be entwined in rope rather than having to cover the object's surface.

Like its competitors, Cheyenne was created for sheer speed, pushing the state of the art in materials, construction, and operation. PlayStation was skippered and owned by Steve Fossett. It is owned by and operated by Virgin Oceanic's co-founder Chris Welsh. Career Construction of the boat was by Mick Cookson of Cookson Boatworks in Auckland, New Zealand in 1998 to 1999. The boats construction was made from pre-preg carbon fiber laminates in various orientations, with a 38 mm aluminum honeycomb core. After breaking the 24-hour distance record (583 NM) PlayStation suffered a fire while being prepared to be shipped to the US. The cause of the fire was the over-charging of the NiMH batteries, and the damage from the fire required that 26' of the starboard hull be replaced. A portion of the hull was created at the builders which was grafted to the original bow and stern leaving virtually no evidence of the fire. PlayStation was originally launched with hulls of and was lengthened to LOA in August 2000, to minimize pitching. At PlayStation was overpowered and the possibility of a pitch pole in a yacht this size warranted the refit. Maximum beam remains at and max draft with daggerboards down is . The boat carries of sail upwind, and a total of downwind from her 147.5 foot carbon mast. In The Race, PlayStation suffered mechanical failures from the start and withdrew from the competition on Day 16. In 2001 Fossett and his crew crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 4 days and 17 hours establishing a new world record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean on a sail vessel. In 2006, Cheyenne's mast broke due to severe weather off the coast of Argentina. Cheyenne was converted to a power catamaran and underwent significant changes and became the mothership for Virgin Oceanic's deep sea exploration mission called 5 Dives. In 2009 Cheyenne was purchased by Chris Welsh from the estate of Steve Fossett. Plans are to launch a deep sea submarine to carry passengers to extreme ocean depths. The deep sea adventure will be supported by Cheyenne, and will use the HOT DeepFlight Challenger sub to plumb the depths of the world's oceans to full depth. Both of these were owned by Steve Fossett, who had modified the racing catamaran to become the mothership to his oceanic dive record attempt. The submarine seats one person, and is currently the only manned submersible capable of reaching the deepest part of the oceans. Records * Transatlantic record of in a time of 4 days, 17 hours, 28 minutes, and 6 seconds in October 2001, with a total distance of at an average speed of 25.78 knots. * The 24 hour distance run of at an average speed of 28.63 knots in 2001. * The round the world sailing record of 58 days 9 hours 32 minutes and 45 seconds in 2004.

The WUO required members to live in \\"weather collectives\\" in an effort to reject the bourgeois society. All female members were required to have sex with all male members, and women also had sexual relations with other women, as monogamous relationships were considered \\"counterrevolutionary.\\" Revolution was considered to be the top priority, therefore, new mothers were required to give their babies to lower-ranking members if they appeared to be overly distracted from their political goals. Actions October 14, 1970 - The Women's Brigade bomb the Center for International Affairs at Harvard UniversityAccording to the book, Harvard's Jews, Women, and Blacks by Morton and Phyllis Keller, in the 1960s, there were only four female professors out of 427 on the faculty. One in twenty law students was a female, compared to an equal number of men and women in the early 2000s. The University was predominantly male, and women were not allowed to fully become co-residences on campus until 1972.Berger 142 and is conducted in solidarity with Angela Davis, a political activist who had recently been arrested. The bombing is considered to be the first action taken by the Brigade. The women choose an institution tied to the Vietnam War as their target in order to contest the current notion among some feminists that Vietnam was not a women's issue.

Mountain Moving Day and Six Sisters In January 1973, \\"Mountain Moving Day\\" was a circulated document that attempted to untangle the WUO's inconsistent politics regarding women's liberation and to determine a new direction in light of the January 1973 cease-fire between the United States and Vietnam.Berger 170 With the war on hiatus, Weatherwomen were encouraged to seize this chance to delve deeper into feminism, study, organizing, writings and actions. The article argued for the centrality of women's liberation due to the Weather's public weakness on feminism and because women's liberation struggle is and will be one of the important and decisive ones globally. The paper also encouraged WUO's immersion in the women's movement, to push for internationalism and anti- racism as well as learning and benefiting from what the women's liberation movement had to offer. The document acknowledged that feminism would be an uphill battle because much of the women's movement felt at odds with the Weather Underground. \\"Mountain Moving Day\\" resulted in a feminist initiative within WUO, which centered upon three goals: (1) \\"To encourage solidarity among women, to make work among women a priority (geographically, structurally, programmatically), (2) To develop a women's program for and about women; to actively participate in building the women's movement, (3) To recognize the need for solidarity among men.\\"Berger 171 Women raised criticisms while the organization was falling apart and afterward suggest that these policies were not consistently applied. The principles say nothing directly about the biggest obstacle to women's liberation: male supremacy and how WUO as a whole could fight it. The impact of the article, however, was significant if only for women in the group. Six months after this historic document was circulated, WUO women initiated a summer project which was a six- week study group by women underground working with some key above ground supporters, which focused upon female oppression and its relationship to anti- imperialist politics. The group specifically focused on HEW, which they called the \\"major government vehicle of social control of women,\\" comparing it to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The women who convened the study distributed a packet entitled: \\"Six Sisters,\\" which explained their motivations, their wide- ranging reading list, meeting notes and plans for action. Weatherwomen started to bond over common experiences and shared commitments in a way that had once eluded them. Solidarity was engendered and some began living in all-women collectives.

The film stars Ajith Kumar in the lead role, who is also credited for the story, dialogues, screenplay and co-direction of the film, while Sameera Reddy and Bhavana play the lead female roles. The film features an extensive cast, with Prabhu, Suresh, Sampath Raj and Rajiv Krishna playing prominent roles, among others. The film, produced by Prabhu Ganesan of Sivaji Productions, features music primarily composed by Bharathwaj, cinematography by Prashanth D. Misale and editing by Anthony Gonsalves. The film revolves around the feud between the three brothers over property; two brothers, from their father's first wife on one side with their avarice for all the wealth with the righteous third, from his father's second marriage, trying to stop the family from breaking down. The feud that exists as an undercurrent in the presence of their father and turns ugly and personal after he passes away. It grows bigger with the two brothers joining in to elbow out the third but he graciously steps aside, only wanting to keep cordial relations. But, the two brothers are just not able to handle the huge wealth and the responsibility that it brings. Their wealth attracts trouble and it is up to the third to come back and save his brothers, against others who strive for the wealth while the crux of the plot revolves around if wealth does disintegrate the family. Pre-production for the project began in December 2007 when Sivaji Productions signed up Ajith for a film; however, because of a bevy of changes in the technical crew, shooting only began in April 2009. The filming took place in various locations: notably locally in Chennai, and abroad in Paris, Dubai and Kuala Lumpur. The film opened worldwide on 550 screens (including 350 screens in India) following its release on 5 February 2010.  Plot  Jeevanandham (Ajith Kumar) is an international negotiator and arms dealer based in Paris. He has three sons: Sam (Sampath Raj) and Vicky (Rajiv Krishna) from his first wife, and Shiva (also Ajith) from his affair. Jeevanandham's favorite is Shiva, who is gutsy and righteous, while the other two are immature and controlled by their evil uncle Kali Mamma (Pradeep Rawat), and will do any shady deals. Sarah (Sameera Reddy) is a cultural attaché at the Indian Embassy in Paris, and she has a soft spot for Shiva. A French police officer Daniel Dharmaraj (Suresh) constantly hangs around with the family and is a partner in crime. The bad sons want to deal in drugs and supply arms to terrorists; they work out a strategy to eliminate Shetty (Kelly Dorji), who controls the Mumbai underworld, but Jeevanandham and Shiva oppose it. After Jeevanandham's death, Vicky is kidnapped by Shetty and his gang, who brutally torture him. To save Vicky, Shiva goes to Mumbai. His local contact there is Mirasi (Prabhu Ganesan), his father's best friend. A local girl Sulabha (Bhavana), falls for our hero, who daringly rescues Vicky with the joker Don Samosa (Yugi Sethu). Both brothers double-cross Shiva, shoot him, and drown him in the sea. They torture Sarah and make her to sign as witness that Shiva dies naturally. As per Jeevanandam's will, the property rights belong to Shiva, hence Sam and Vicky attempted to kill Shiva. With the help of Mirasi, Sulabha, and Don Samosa, everyone moves to France to find the real enemies. Sarah, who is being given drugs to forget Shiva's death and is also tortured by Vicky every day to accept his love, is found by Shiva and confesses everything to him. Vicky walks in and brutally beats Sarah. Shiva shoots him and interrogates him to find out the reason behind why the two brothers shot him. After Vicky refuses to say, Shiva shoots him on the spot and saves Sarah. Sam finds out about Vicky's death and suspects Daniel, but is subdued by Kali Mamma. Shiva slowly uncovers what happened through forcing and threatening the allies of Sam and Kali Mamma. Eventually, a drunk Don Samosa accidentally spills Shiva being alive to Daniel, who kidnaps Mirasi, Sulabha, and Sarah and holds them captive in a storage facility. Shiva is forced to surrender Jeevanandham's will to Kali Mamma and Sam, but delivers an empty suitcase instead. An infuriated Kali Mamma shoots Mirasi and Daniel, and Sam throws Shiva out a glass window and ties him up. After Shiva tells Sam to give up his arrogance, Sam and Kali Mamma reveal why and how they killed Jeevanandham. Sam wanted to deal weapons to foreign terrorists and asked Jeevananandham to give money to aid them. After Jeevanandham tries reasoning to little avail, Kali Mamma walks in. After he refuses everyone's request to deal weapons and give his money, Kali Mamma electrocutes and Sam suffocates Jeevanandham, killing him in the process. They do the same with Shiva after explaining, electrocuting him multiple times, but eventually an enraged Shiva breaks the ropes he is tied to and engages in combat with Sam and Kali Mamma, electrocuting and killing both of them. Daniel, now a reformed, honest cop, brings Mirasi to Shiva, and tells him that he will take the blame for Sam and Kali Mamma's deaths by saying that he killed them in self-defense. The film ends several months later with Shiva and Sulabha, now married, waving goodbye to Don Samosa, Sarah, and Mirasi, and leaving to India from Paris together.

Mohan  Production  Development = Following the success of Billa in December 2007, Ajith Kumar was signed for a record salary of 6 croreAjith salary soars to 6 crore for Asal by Prabhu's Sivaji Productions for a project touted to be directed by K. S. Ravikumar. Three months later, the producers officially signed on Gautham Menon as the director; Sameera Reddy, the female lead for Menon's last film, was also finalised for the project. Initially, the producer was considering Anushka Shetty as the female lead. The film, which was due to start its first schedule during June 2008, had been built up as the final instalment in Gautham Menon's police trilogy, following his two earlier ventures, Kaaka Kaaka and Vettaiyaadu Vilaiyaadu, of which Ajith was originally meant to be a part. However, other indications suggested that the film was set to be the remake of the classic, Pudhiya Paravai starring Sivaji Ganesan, which Ganesan's son, Prabhu, denied. The film had been earlier titled by the media as Kanavugal Karpanaigal or Vaanam Kadandha Siragugal, but the team then finalised the title of Surangani, which was later abbreviated to Sura. However, the film's production failed to take off, with repeated dates being announced by the directors for the film's first schedule throughout 2009. Subsequently, Menon was removed from the project by the producers due to the film's inactivity, with directors Dharani, Vishnuvardhan and Saran leading the race to take over. In January 2009, the film was reannounced by Prabhu and the story was subsequently changed with Saran being signed up as the film's director. Ajith also underwent an appearance change during the early months of 2009 to prepare for his role. The film was eventually launched on 8 April 2009 at Sivaji's family residence Annai Illam in Chennai. The film completed its production schedule by January 2010, and post-production and release works began soon after. = Casting = Following the announcement that Sivaji Productions, Ajith Kumar and Gautham Menon would come together, other technicians were added to the film. Menon's usual collaborator, Harris Jayaraj, was signed on as the music composer. However, after Menon's departure, Jayaraj also left the project due to his busy schedule with other films. After approaching Yuvan Shankar Raja for the job, Saran finally confirmed Bharathwaj as music director. Asal was Bharathwaj's fiftieth film as composer; he had previously teamed up with Saran and Ajith on Kadhal Mannan, Amarkalam and Attagasam. Ajith was under contract to be paid a remuneration of $1.25 million in cash plus a 30 per cent share of the profit from sales of rights of the film.Ajith get 30 per cent share in profit from rights' sales. Economictimes.indiatimes.com (27 July 2009). Retrieved on 21 February 2014. During the launch in April 2009, other film technicians were revealed. Y-Kinz, an international music group, were announced to be a part of the music album for the film headed with Bharathwaj. Ajith himself had recommended Prashanth D. Misale, an assistant to Nirav Shah, to make his debut as a cinematographer. Anthony was selected as editor; Prabakar was chosen to work as the art director and Vairamuthu as the chief lyricist. Vivek Karunakaran, a Chennai- based fashion designer, was selected to make his debut as the film's costume designer. Soon after the launch, co-producer Prabhu Ganesan cast himself to play an important role in the film. Gautham Menon's original choice, Sameera Reddy, was retained to star opposite Ajith in the film. Initially Anushka Shetty was considered for the role. Sameera appears alongside Ajith for the first time, despite previously being scheduled to appear opposite him in Citizen, which eventually went ahead without her. Mamta Mohandas was initially confirmed as the second heroine in Asal, but decided not to take the role. Sneha, Shriya Saran, newcomer Hansika Motwani and Bhavana were also approached for the second heroine's role, however Sneha was unable to comply due to call sheet problems, so Bhavana was finalised. A plethora of antagonistic roles were handed out for the film, with the initial selection being Rajiv Krishna. Other cast members are Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Karen Miao Sapru, Adithya, Suresh, Sampath Raj, Surendra Pal and Yugi Sethu. = Filming = Audio launch Principal photography of the film began in June 2009 at an undisclosed location in Malaysia. The first schedule was completed on 2 August 2009. After a hectic schedule from Malaysia, the shooting for the second schedule continued on 18 September 2009 at Paris and Lyon, France. 30% of the scenes, including fight sequences and two song sequences, were canned there, including a duet song of Ajith and Sameera as pictured against the moonlit Eiffel Tower in Paris. After a 45-day shoot, the team returned to Chennai on 23 October 2009. Additional shooting was held in Harrington Road on 2 November. Asal's team later shot some of the important shots in AVM Studios. The film's dubbing schedule took off on 19 November at Four Frames Preview Theatre Chennai with a simple pooja ceremony. Ajith, Saran, Arjun (Prabhu's son), Dushyanth (Ramkumar's son) and other members of the film were present there. On 24 November 2009, an important scene for the film was shot at Sivaji Ganesan's house in T. Nagar, Chennai. A song sequence featuring Ajith and Bhavana was shot at the AVM Studios on 25 November 2009. The shooting of the final song was held at Binny Mills (Tambaram). The cast and crew of Asal went to a Middle East country for the remaining song shoot. The Asal unit left Chennai on 26 December and returned after a week. Shooting was finished on 31 December 2009 at Dubai, where a song sequence was filmed at Zabeel Park.  Release  Reception = Made on a high budget, Asal opened to mixed reviews. Critics cited that the film is strictly for Ajith fans and that it couldn't live up to its expectations, whilst also criticising its Billa hangover. Sify cited that the film, which \\"should have been called Billa-2\\", \\"falls flat due to lack of proper story and narration\\", adding, that the film \\"belongs to Ajith\\" and \\"it is a good ride if you keep your expectation meter low\\".Movie Review : Aasal review. Sify.com. Retrieved on 21 February 2014. A reviewer from Behindwoods gave the film 2 out of 5, claiming that this film \\"will gain no great interest\\".

Until 2001, the species E. rufus was considered a subspecies of the common brown lemur, E. fulvus, after which it was classified as its own species. In December 2008, the species was split into two separate species, the red lemur, E. rufus, distributed in dry lowland forests in northwestern Madagascar, and the red- fronted lemur, E. rufifrons, distributed in southwest and eastern Madagascar. The species split was based on genetic and morphological evidence. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that E. rufifrons may be more closely related to the Common Brown Lemur (E. fulvus), white-headed lemur (E. albifrons) and Sanford's brown lemur (E. sanfordi) than it is to E. rufus. The red lemur's range covers dry deciduous forests in southwestern Madagascar between the Betsiboka River to the north and the Tsiribihina River to the south. The Tsiribihina River forms the boundary between E. rufus, which lives north of the river, and E. rufifrons, which lives south of the river. It has a head and body length of and with a tail. Its weight ranges between . It has a gray coat and black face, muzzle and forehead, plus a black line from the muzzle to the forehead, with white eyebrow patches. Males have white or cream colored cheeks and beards, while females have rufous or cream cheeks and beards that are less bushy than males. The species is currently listed by the IUCN as Vulnerable. The most important threats to the species are hunting, as well as habitat destruction resulting from slash-and-burn agriculture, clearing of land for pasture, fuelwood gathering and logging. The hunting level is viewed as unsustainable.

He was the Secretary General of the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Foundation Secretary of the Open University. Early years Christodoulou was born in Cyprus in 1932, the oldest of three sons of Yianni Christodoulos, a cobbler, and his wife, Maria, née Haji. He came to London when he was three to join his father who was working as a kitchen porter in Soho. He hardly knew his mother, who died giving birth to twin sons, who lived. These twin brothers later went to live in Barbados with foster parents. Christodoulou had been born on Easter Day and was named 'Anastasios' by his parents, meaning 'Resurrection'.'Resurrection' on the Electronic Translator. He lived with his father above a Soho restaurant and early on displayed a precocious intelligence. He went to a local primary school aged five, not knowing a word of English, but by half-term was interpreting for much of the local Greek Cypriot community. Aged 11 he won a place at St Marylebone Grammar School.Richard Bourne, ‘Christodoulou, Anastasios (1932–2002)’ , Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition, Oxford University Press, January 2006; online edition, January 2009 (subscription required).

The Open University After graduating in 1955 from Queen's College, Oxford in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, he joined the overseas Colonial Service and served as District Officer and later District Commissioner and Magistrate in Tanganyika. In 1963 he moved to the University of Leeds, where he was Assistant Registrar and later Deputy Secretary. In 1968, he became Foundation Secretary of the Open University, having been appointed by Walter Perry, the University's Vice- Chancellor. They began work on 1 January 1969. While in recent years the OU has been described as one of the great educational initiatives of the twentieth century, its early days were difficult. Labour politicians Harold Wilson and Jennie Lee had been determined that it should be a 'proper' university, there were many who believed that the University would fail, and would award worthless degrees. Christodoulou also had to overcome various disputes between course teams, the BBC, and regional organisers. When Edward Heath's Conservative Party came to power in 1970 Margaret Thatcher was appointed Secretary of State for Education and Science. She proved to be deeply sceptical about the academic standards of the OU, believing that students could get degrees just by ticking boxes, because some courses included multiple-choice questions. Christodoulou and Walter Perry travelled back to London with Thatcher after she had visited the Open University, and managed to persuade her that it was genuine and useful. In 1971 Christodoulou was responsible for managing 43,000 initial applications, from which 24,000 students began degree courses.

With Loucas Haji-Ioannou, the father of Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of EasyJet, he attempted to set up a new Cyprus university, but, to his disappointment, Haji-Ioannou pulled out. Shortly before his death Christodoulou returned to the village where he had been born but was unhappy to discover that it had been occupied by Turkish troops.

It was unusual in that it was formed from all parts of the German Armed Forces; the 2,500 men in the brigade were formed from 1,000 from the Heer, 500 from the Waffen SS, 800 from the Luftwaffe and 200 from the Kriegsmarine. It was tasked with the capture of the bridges at Amay, Engis and Huy. The Brigade is known for including English-speaking members wearing American Army uniforms to cause disruption and disinformation behind the American lines. The Brigade was also issued captured Allied equipment and had two Sherman tanks (which never saw action due to mechanical problems) and German vehicles were modified to resemble Allied armoured vehicles.  Operation Greif  The German code name for this unit's role in the Ardennes offensive was Unternehmen Greif (Operation Greif). The timing of the offensive meant that the Brigade Commander Otto Skorzeny had only 5 or 6 weeks to recruit and train a brand new unit. Within four days he sent his plans for 150 Panzerbrigade to General Alfred Jodl. Despite asking for 3,300 men he was given an immediate go-ahead and promised full support. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht issued an order on 25 October requesting suitable soldiers for the operation with \\"knowledge of the English language and also the American dialect\\" which was passed on to every headquarters on the Western Front, and this request soon became known to the Allies.Pallud, p. 4 The new brigade needed US Army vehicles, weapons and uniforms; OB West was asked to find 15 tanks, 20 armoured cars, 20 self-propelled guns, 100 Jeeps, 40 motorcycles, 120 trucks, and British and US Army uniforms all to be delivered to the brigade's training camp which had been set up at Grafenwöhr in eastern Bavaria. The equipment delivered fell short of the requirements, including only two Sherman tanks in poor condition, and Skorzeny had to use German substitutes, 5 Panther tanks, 5 StuG IIIs and 6 armoured cars. The brigade was also flooded by Polish and Russian equipment sent by units who had no idea what the request was for. As far as English-speaking soldiers went, only 10 men who spoke perfect English and had some knowledge of American idiom were found, 30-40 men who spoke English well but had no knowledge of slang, 120-150 who spoke English moderately well, and 200 or so who had learned English at school. Faced with these setbacks, Skorzeny scaled down Panzer Brigade 150 from three battalions to two and assembled the 150 best English speakers into a commando unit named Einheit Stielau. Skorzeny also recruited a company of SS-Jagdverbände \\"Mitte\\" and two companies from SS-Fallschirmjäger-Battalion 600, and was given two Luftwaffe parachute battalions formerly of KG 200, tank crews from Panzer regiments, and gunners from artillery units. A total of 2,500 men were eventually assembled at Grafenwöhr, 800 less than had been hoped. The final total of equipment assembled was also less than had been hoped; only enough US Army weapons had been found to equip the commando unit, and only 4 US Army scout cars, 30 Jeeps, and 15 trucks were found, the difference being made up with German vehicles painted in US olive drab with Allied markings applied. Only a single Sherman tank was available, and the brigade's five Panther tanks were disguised as M10 tank destroyers by removing their cupolas and disguising their hulls and turrets with thin sheet metal. The problem of recognition by their own forces was crucial, and they were to identify themselves by various methods: displaying a small yellow triangle at the rear of their vehicles; tanks keeping their guns pointing in the nine o' clock position; troops wearing pink or blue scarves and removing their helmets; and flashes from a blue or red torch at night. As the brigade prepared for action, rumours began to fly that they were to relieve the besieged towns of Dunkirk or Lorient, capture Antwerp, or to capture the Allied Supreme Command at SHAEF at Paris.Delaforce, p. 60 It was not until 10 December that Skorzeny's own commanders were made aware of the brigade's true plans. Panzer Brigade 150 was to attempt to capture at least two of the bridges over the Meuse river at Amay, Huy, and Andenne before they could be destroyed, the troops to begin their operation when the Panzer advance reached the Hohes Venn, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The three groups (Kampfgruppe X, Kampfgruppe Y, and Kampfgruppe Z) would then move towards the separate bridges. When Unternehmen Greif started, the brigade was held up in the massive traffic jams which caused major problems to the entire offensive. After losing two days this way, the original goals of the brigade was more or less given up and it was to fight as a regular formation. It was given the task of capturing Malmedy, but a deserter warned the US forces of the plans. The attack was met with heavy fire and the Germans were forced to retreat. The US artillery took a heavy toll on the unit even when it was withdrawn from the actual fighting, the wounded included Otto Skorzeny himself who was hit by shrapnel.  Aftermath  The brigade was finally withdrawn from the front lines on 28 Dec, being replaced by 18th Volksgrenadier Division. 44 German soldiers wearing U.S. uniforms managed to slip through U.S. lines and all but 8 returned alive. Another 23 of its men were captured and 18 were executed as spies. After World War II, Skorzeny was tried as a war criminal at the Dachau Trials in 1947 for allegedly violating the laws of war during the Battle of the Bulge. He and nine officers of the Panzerbrigade 150 were charged with improperly using American uniforms by entering into combat disguised therewith and treacherously firing upon and killing members of the United States Armed Forces. They were also charged with participation in wrongfully obtaining U.S. uniforms and Red Cross parcels consigned to American prisoners of war from a prisoner-of-war camp. Acquitting all defendants, the military tribunal drew a distinction between using enemy uniforms during combat and for other purposes including deception; it could not be shown that Skorzeny had actually given any orders to fight in U.S. uniforms.TRIAL OF OTTO SKORZENY AND OTHERS Skorzeny said that he was told by German legal experts that as long he doesn't order his men to fight in combat while wearing U.S. uniforms, such a tactic was a legitimate ruse of war. A surprise defense witness was F. F. E. Yeo- Thomas, a former Allied SOE agent, who testified that he and his operatives wore German uniforms behind enemy lines.

It is believed by many to be the birthplace of Jayadeva, an issue that is still debated by scholars. It has developed as a religious centre with many temples and ashramas (hermitages). An annual fair, popular as baul fair, is organized on the occasion of Makar Sankranti. History Jaydev Kenduli had long been considered as a possible birthplace of the poet Jayadeva, who had composed Gita Govinda in Sanskrit. However, now there appears to be a consensus among scholars that Jayadeva was born in another place in Orissa bearing the same name, in Kenduli Sasan. He was believed to be the court poet of Raja Lakshman Sen, who ruled in the 12th-13th century. The image of Radhamadhav set up by him is daily worshipped. The asana (mat) on which the poet sat and obtained siddhi (salvation) through meditation is carefully preserved. During the Mughal era Jaydev Kenduli was part of Senpahari pargana. As per a firman issued by Aurangzeb in the 17th century, Senpahari was added to the property of Krishnaram Rai of Bardhaman Raj. Maharani Brajakishori of Bardhaman had set up temples in different places such as Puri and Vrindaban. Jugal Kishore Mukhopadhyay of Jaydev Kenduli was then court-poet at Bardhaman. It is said that it was at his request that the Maharani set up the Radhabinod temple at Jaydev Kenduli in 1683. The temple stands where the house of the poet Jayadeva, was believed locally to have stood, based on the prior assumption of his birth there.Mukhopadhyay, Aditya, Birbhumer Mela, Paschim Banga, Birbhum Special Issue, p. 213, (in Bengali), February 2006, Information and Culture Deptt., Government of West Bengal Around 1860-70, Radharaman Brajabasi of the Nirbak Vaisnava sect set up the Nirbak Ashrama at Jaydev Kenduli, the place of birth of their kula guru (patron saint) of the sect, the poet Jayadeva. In the first half of the 20th century, the Radhaballav temple of the Mukhopadhyay family was established. Many more ashramas (hermitages) were set up and thus Jaydev Kenduli developed as a religious centre. GeographyLocation= Jaydev Kenduli is located at . It has an average elevation of . It is located on the banks of Ajay River. Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the area. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map. Villages in Jaydev Kenduli panchayat are: Joydev Kenduli, Tikarbeta, Sahapur, Janubazar, Raghunathpur, Mundira, Balarpur, Santoshpur, Bhubanaswer, Sugarh, Chhata Chak, and Akamba. On the densely forested southern bank of the Ajay, a little down-stream from Jaydev Kenduli, which is located on the northern bank of the river, is Gourangapur, associated with Ichhai Ghosh, a renowned regional power in the 11th century.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 123-129, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata Demographics In the 2001 census, Jaydev Kenduli village had a population of 2,755, of whom 976 belonged to scheduled castes. Culture Radhabinode Temple, a navaratna temple with nine turrets Details of terracotta carving in Radhabinode Temple =Terracotta carvings= The Radhabinode temple has exquisite terracotta carvings, some depicting Ramayana scenes.Sarkar, Joydeep, Paryatan Boichitre Birbhum Jela, Paschim Banga, Birbhum Special Issue, p. 199 =Fair= A fair is organized in memory of Jayadeva on the occasion of Poush Sankranti or Makar Sankranti. It starts on the last day of the Bengali calendar month, Poush and continues up to 2 Magh. The start of the fair commemorates the auspicious day on which Jayadeva is claimed to have taken a bath at the Kadaambokhandi ghat of the Ajay river at Jaydev Kenduli. In 1982, the district authorities took control of the fair to provide a better environment, a good sanitation system, drinking water, lighting and security. Several thousand bauls, a community of wandering minstrels who sing devotional songs to the music of the ektara (one stringed instrument), assemble for the fair and as such it is also referred to as Baul Fair. The bauls stay in 160 temporary hermitages at Jaydev Kenduli for around a month. These bauls appear to have inherited the legacy of Jayadeva songs. However, in recent years, the greatest baul fair in the state is gradually losing its character, as the bauls have been outnumbered by kirtanias, who perform in the mela to gain popularity. In 2008, around 2,000 kirtanias came to attend the mela and they obtained contracts worth Rs. 20 million. It is not known whether Rabindranath Tagore ever visited Jaydev Kenduli. However, many personalities linked with Santiniketan such as Kshiti Mohan Sen, Nandalal Bose, Provat Kumar Mukhopadhyay, Ramkinkar Baij, and Santideb Ghosh visited Jaydev Kenduli and contributed substantially towards the spread of its name outside Birbhum and added to its fame.Kundu, Chandan, Birbhumer Baul: Swatantrer Sandhane, Paschim Banga, Birbhum Special Issue, p. 219 The fair, which is believed by some to have been there for around centuries, caters primarily to the requirements of village folk.

Opened the Show ground In the Premiers speech Mr. Gunn said: In the State election held on 10 February 1912, Thomas Butterfield was given Labor Party endorsement for the three Member House of Assembly District of Flinders, but he and his colleague, one of the sitting members were defeated. Thomas Butterfield was appointed organizer for the United Labor Party in 1915. In the 1915 election he was endorsed for the two-Member electorate of Newcastle and both he and his running mate, Andrew Kirkpatrick were elected. In the 1916 Party plebiscite for the endorsement of three candidates for the Senate, a record 10,321 ballot papers were returned resulting in the election of Frank Lundie (A.W.U. Secretary) Thomas was second with 4,540 votes and Lionel Hill, who later became Premier, was third with 4,276 votes. Thomas resigned his seat in the house of Assembly on 21 March 1917, to contest that year's Senate election, but was badly beaten by the team led by the former Labor Senator E.J.Guthrie, who was expelled for his support for conscription and then ran as a Nationalist. Guthrie polled 106,408 votes to the 79,541 votes polled by Thomas who topped Labor's Senate vote. In the by-election held on 12 May 1917, caused by his resignation from Newcastle to contest the Senate election, the vacancy went to the Anti-Labor Candidate, Edward Twopeny. Thomas was re- elected for Newcastle in the elections held in 1918, 1921, 1924, 1927 and 1930, but he and his running mate William Harvey, lost their seats in the 1933 election to Jim Beerworth and Lindsay Riches. He had joined the Premiers' Planners led by Lionel Hill and was expelled from the party in August 1931. He and the others who were expelled had formed a breakaway Party that they called the P.L.P. (Parliamentary Labor Party). In 1922 Thomas, while still a member of the House of Assembly, contested the plebiscite for the Federal House of Representatives seat of Grey, which finally went to Andrew Lacey, who succeeded in defeating the sitting member, Alexander Poynton who had held the seat from 1903 until 1917. In 1924 Thomas attempted to make a deal with the Leader of the Country Party, Malcolm McIntosh, under which the A.L.P. would give the Country Party a clear run for the Northern District of the South Australian Legislative Council in return for a written undertaking that the Country Party support the Labor Party against the Liberal Party in Parliament. The proposal was rejected. Post-political life The highlight of his career was being sworn in as Commissioner of Crown Lands, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Afforestation. (Gunn Government 1924) He was responsible for the re-organization of the instructorship of the branch of the Agriculture Department, establishment of the Dairy Dept. and the augment of the plantation of of pines a year, that has continued from that time. Thomas was a pioneer farmer in the Wudinna area, he purchased sections 6 and 8 in the hundred of Wudinna (near Kyancutta) it is not clear if the family actually lived at Wudinna, but it is safe to say that the eldest children Honora and T. Harris were sent to Wudinna to get the farm set up and ready for the rest of the family. The Wudinna block was sold to the Spiers family in 1918. In 1921 when Thomas and the family went to live at Johnberg on a grazing property that was purchased. T. Harris did not go with the family; he went to Yardea working as a station hand. Honora (Nora) married Michael Meers at Orroroo. George Polden first built the home on the property in 1879. It was a three room stone hut, and later a fine three-room house was built in front of the original building. The name \\"BUTTERFIELDS\\" stuck with the home and in the 1970s Jeremy Browne restored the house to its original condition, he worked at weekends from Adelaide and in 1979 a plaque was unveiled for the Butterfield home centenary, Jack Butterfield attended. Thomas did not do too well out of grazing and in 1924 the property was sold back to the Luckraft's who still own it. After Johnberg a home was bought at Athelstone and a farm in the Mallee with son Jack running it. After four years Thomas retired to the city home and Jack was forced off the land losing everything in 1938. External links *Agricultural College, Roseworthy photograph of T.

One day, Midori meets a boy called Hino Tsukasa, who came to the island she lives on for a holiday. He teaches her to play soccer and she falls in love with the sport. Inspired by Tsukasa, Midori continues to play soccer in hopes that they would meet again someday. When they do meet again, Tsukasa loses her trust by doing something unforgivable. He seduces her on the first date, even going so far as to claim that they'll marry someday, in order to convince her to give him her virginity which she'd been saving for her future husband. The next day she finds him demanding payment from his teammates for having won the bet, laughing about how easy it is to get a \\"country girl\\" to have sex, and speculating that he'd do it with her a few more times before leaving; when he discovers that she heard all of this, he arrogantly tells her that she's at fault for being too trusting, and that she should be proud to have had sex with a future soccer star like himself. Determined to defeat Tsukasa on the soccer field, and bring him down for what he'd done, Midori disguises herself as a boy and enrolls in an all-boys high school that rivals Tsukasa's and joins their team.

Life He was born at Bristol on 8 July 1743, into a Catholic family, and was educated at Scorton school, near Catterick, Yorkshire. He was then sent to the monastic seminary of Lacelle in France. He afterwards studied at Paris, Bordeaux, and in the Royal Academy at Turin, devoting special attention to literature and art. The death of his brother, who had devised to him a small estate at Hamsterley in Durham, placed him in independent circumstances. He proceeded to Turin, Genoa, and Florence. He met in Paris his future wife Martha, daughter of John Baker of Chichester, solicitor to the Leeward Islands, who was being educated at a convent of Ursuline nuns. They were married at Aix-la-Chapelle on 24 March 1767. The couple then settled at Hamsterley, where the husband laid out the estate. They passed the autumn of 1774 and the following months until September 1775 at Bordeaux, and then visited the Pyrenees. Swinburne in the company of Sir Thomas Gascoigne travelled through Spain, returning to Bayonne in June 1776.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745–1810 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016), ch. 2. A manuscript describing his journey was sent to Samuel Henley as editor. It was published in 1779 as Travels through Spain, 1775 and 1776, illustrated with drawings of Roman and Moorish architecture. On his return to Bayonne in June 1776 Swinburne, with his family, travelled to Marseilles, and a supplementary volume describing the expedition was issued in 1787. They then sailed to Naples, and travelled in the Two Sicilies, where they stayed for 1777 and 1778, and for the early months of 1779. Their return to England was by Vienna, Frankfurt, and Brussels, and they arrived in London in July 1779, but after a few months in England passed once more through France to Italy (March to July 1780) and then until November in Vienna. They formed acquaintance with literati in each country, and received compliments from the Catholic sovereigns. At Vienna Maria Theresa conferred on Mrs. Swinburne the female order of La Croix Étoilée, and the Emperor Joseph II stood godfather to their son of that name. They were in Brussels from February to June 1781, and again crossed to England. By this time Martha's property in the West Indies had been laid waste. With letters of introduction to the French court, from Vienna, Swinburne went to Paris (1783), and through Marie-Antoinette' s influence obtained a grant of all uncultivated crown lands in the island of St. Vincent valued at £30,000. In February 1785 William Pitt offered half that sum for it, and on receiving a refusal passed through parliament a bill to impose heavy taxation upon the unproductive lands in all the West Indian islands. Swinburne then parted with his interest for £6,500. From September 1786 to June 1788 Swinburne was again in Paris, and high in favour with Marie-Antoinette. His eldest son was enrolled among the royal pages, and placed under the care of the Prince de Lambesc. Swinburne's later years were clouded by misfortune. His eldest daughter, Mary Frances, married on 7 September 1793 Paul Benfield, whose wealth crumbled away as rapidly as it grew, and Swinburne was involved in the ruin. His eldest son died in a storm on his way to Jamaica in 1800. In the meantime Swinburne was sent to Paris in September 1796 as commissioner, to negotiate an exchange of prisoners with France, but, in the face of difficulties arising from the capture by the French of Sir Sidney Smith, was unsuccessful, and in December 1797 was recalled to England, In December 1801 he went out to the lucrative post of vendue-master in the newly ceded settlement of Trinidad, and also as commissioner to deliver up the Danish West Indian islands to a Danish official. He died from sunstroke at Trinidad on 1 April 1803, and was buried at San Juan, where his friend. Sir Ralph Woodford, raised a monument to his memory. Works Travels through Spain, 1775 and 1776 was published in 1779. In 1787 it was reprinted in two octavo volumes, and in the same year a French translation by J. B. De la Borde came out at Paris. Abridgments, with engravings from some additional drawings by Swinburne, appeared in 1806 and 1813. This was the first antiquarian book in England on Spain. The Travels are cited by Edward Gibbon (Decline and Fall, chaps, ix. and x.) The first volume of Swinburne's Travels in the two Sicilies. 1777-1780, was published in 1783, and the second came out in 1785, with plates from Swinburne's drawings. A second edition appeared in 1790; a French translation of them by La Borde was issued at Paris in 1785, and in the same year a German translation by J. R. Forster was published at Hamburg. At a later date La Borde translated the supplementary Journey from Bayonne to Marseilles. There were published in 1841, under the editorship of Charles White, two volumes entitled The Courts of Europe at the close of the last Century, which consisted of the letters of Henry Swinburne, mostly on foreign life (dating from March 1774, and chiefly addressed to his brother, Sir Edward Swinburne); many of the anecdotes and statements must be read with caution (Quarterly Review, lxviii. 146-76). They were reprinted in 1895 Family He was the fourth son of Sir John Swinburne, 3rd Baronet of Capheaton, Northumberland, head of an old Roman Catholic family, who married on 20 July 1721 Mary, only daughter of Edward Bedingfeld, and granddaughter of Sir Henry Bedingfeld of Oxburgh, Norfolk. His father died in January 1745, and his mother died at York on 7 February 1761. He had four sons and six daughters. References * * Stefano O.

Unknown to Mamaru, Fujino has a vibrator in her vagina, which increased its intensity when Mamaru pushed himself against her. Unable to turn off the vibrator discreetly, Fujino endures the train ride while requesting Mamaru to satisfy her sexual cravings, to which he complies. After they get off the train, Fujino gives Mamaru a remote control for her vibrator as a thank you gift. After the incident, Fujino meets Mamaru to satisfy her sexual needs. Not impressed by Mamaru's libido, she runs off and meets Mita Yuki, a girl who has a crush on Mamaru. Mita gives Fujino a potion that she says will improve Fujino and Mamaru's sex life warning her not to drink it. Curious about the contents of the potion while also thinking about Mamaru's well-being should it be poisoned or contaminated, Fujino drinks it. The potion increases Fujino's sexual desire. In an attempt to rid herself off the effects of the potion, Fujino takes Mamaru into a school bathroom and tells him to repeatedly have sex with her (Fujino's plea for sexual relief is the first and only time when she verbally speaks to him). He does so until she faints. Mamaru takes Fujino to the school nurse. He meets Mita in the hallway and questions her about why Fujino would be so sexually active. In response, Mita feeds him the potion via a kiss. With his libido increased, he takes Mita home, where she forces herself on him. Meanwhile, Fujino wakes up at the nurse's office and wants to know where Mamaru is. The nurse tells her that she last saw him with Mita. Fearing for Mamaru, she runs to his house to find Mita and Mamaru having sex. Disgusted, Fujino runs out of the house, with Mamaru chasing after her. Mamaru explains the situation to her, and they have makeup sex in an alleyway. One day after getting caught in a fight between Fujino and Mita, Mamaru falls down on his head, causing memory loss.

It was originally derived from the OpenAIS project and licensed under the new BSD License. The mission of the Corosync effort is to develop, release, and support a community-defined, open source cluster. Features The Corosync Cluster Engine is a group communication system with additional features for implementing high availability within applications. The project provides four C API features: * A closed process group communication model with virtual synchrony guarantees for creating replicated state machines. * A simple availability manager that restarts the application process when it has failed. * A configuration and statistics in-memory database that provide the ability to set, retrieve, and receive change notifications of information. * A quorum system that notifies applications when quorum is achieved or lost. The software is designed to operate on UDP/IP and InfiniBand networks. Architecture The software is composed of an executive binary which uses a client-server communication model between libraries and service engines. Loadable modules, called service engines, are loaded into the Corosync Cluster Engine and use the services provided by the Corosync Service Engine internal API. The services provided by the Corosync Service Engine internal API are: * An implementation of the Totem Single Ring Ordering and Membership protocol providing the Extended Virtual Synchrony model Also in Proceedings of DCS, pp. 56-65, 1994. for messaging and membership. * The coroipc high performance shared memory IPC system. * An object database that implements the in memory database model. * Systems to route IPC and Totem messages to the correct service engines.

Peter Flora is a son of the Austrian drawer, caricaturist, graphic artist and illustrator Paul Flora.  Academic career  Peter Flora attended primary and secondary school in Innsbruck. At 21 years he started his studies studying sociology, political science and statistics at the Universities of Tübingen, Berlin, and finally Constance in sociology, political science and statistics (from 1965 to 1969). He concluded his studies in 1969 (aged 25 years old) with a Master of Arts degree of the University of Constance. His Master of Arts thesis dealt with Proposals in Order to Determine the Term and the Investigation of the Phenomenon of Conservatism.Vorschläge zur Bestimmung des Begriffs und zur Untersuchung des Phänomens \\"Konservatismus\\". = The modernization researcher = His years as an assistant from 1969 to 1973 he completed at the Universities of Frankfurt am Main and Mannheim at the chair of Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Zapf; both together organized the QUAM-project (Quantitative Model of Modernization). Based on data collected in this project he received a doctorate in 1972 at the University of Constance on a subject which would occupy him as well as his supervisor Wolfgang Zapf for many years: modernization research. The doctoral dissertation was published in 1974 and 1975 respectively in two parts with the Westdeutscher Verlag. In 1972, when Wolfgang Zapf accepted the professorship of the third chair for sociology (Lehrstuhl für Soziologie III) at the University of Mannheim, Peter Flora moved with him as assistant to Mannheim. Both together applied for the project on Historical Indicators of the Western European Democracies (HIWED) which became funded by the VolkswagenStiftung. Results of this research project consisted of a larger number of presentations, contributions to journals and books, the working paper series of the HIWED-Reports, two dissertations and finally the two-volume data handbook State, Economy, and Society in Western Europe 1815–1975, published in 1983 and 1987 respectively. Only three years after receiving his doctoral degree, in 1976 at the age of 32, Peter Flora has been qualified for lecturing in sociology at the University of Mannheim with a habilitation thesis on Modernization and the Development of the European Welfare States.Modernisierung und die Entwicklung der europäischen Wohlfahrtsstaaten. Expert opinions were delivered by M. Rainer Lepsius and Wolfgang Zapf. Still in the same year, in 1976, Peter Flora attained a C 3 professorship for sociology at the Research Institute for SociologyForschungsinstitut für Soziologie, Universität Köln. of the University of Cologne; there he taught and did research until 1979. The HIWED project was continued by a research project funded by the VolkswagenStiftung in order to build up the so-called West European Data Archive (WEDA). The general goal was to produce a historical data handbook on Western Europe, the theory of Stein Rokkan forming the background, and a series of data-supported analyses on the modernization of West European societies which should pick up and develop further Rokkan's ideas. = The welfare state researcher = In the HIWED project the analysis of redistribution processes by the welfare state played a central role. After Flora had received a call by the European University Institute (EUI)European University Institute in Florence (Italy) in 1979, the expansion of the West European welfare states after World War II moved to the foreground of a large comparative research project titled: Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II. When consciously reversing the title of the famous book Limits to Growth by Donella H. Meadows and Dennis L. Meadows, published in 1972, not only a gimmick in order to create publicity was found, but the central hypothesis of the project was formulated as well: with the extension of the catalogue of life risks secured by the welfare state, and the comprehensive inclusion of almost all population groups in the welfare state programs, the welfare state has attained its limit of extension and ends in a phase of consolidation. Among Flora's most important collaborators in this project, carried through in Florence with numerous doctoral candidates from the member states of the European Union, was mainly Jens Alber, who had already collaborated with him in the HIWED project. In 1982, Peter Flora accepted a call by the Faculty for Social Sciences of the University of Mannheim, to become the successor of M. Rainer Lepsius. In his lectures, he predominantly represented and read on topics of macrosociology and the comparative study of European societies. But one of his central achievements is institution formation i.e. the setting up of the Mannheim Centre for Social Sciences.Mannheimer Zentrum für Sozialwissenschaften. = The scientific entrepreneur = Flora aimed at giving comparative macrosociology, based on official statistics, a systematic basis, a basis which comparative survey research already had received by the way of diverse archives and Summer Schools. His vision was to establish a centre which could become a permanent basis for European-comparative data collection and data processing. Thus, he responsibly wrote an application in order to establish a Mannheim Centre for the Social Sciences which was set up since 1989 by means from the Government of the Land Baden-Württemberg. From 1989 to 1993, Flora acted as founding director of the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES) of today and accomplished here the decisive pioneering work. The main organizational emphasis was placed on the establishment of a European Library, an electronic data processing unit, and of the European Data Archive. From 1996 to 1998 he completed a second time period as director. The West European Data Archive (WEDA), later renamed Research Archive Eurodata, became part of the MZES as an infrastructural department. This archive should document and perpetuate the time series data collections from the HIWED and Growth to Limits projects. At the same time, the archive was intended to support research projects at the MZES. From 1995 to 2002/03, the archive published its own Eurodata-Newsletter. Flora's goal was to permanently institutionalize the monitoring of the welfare state (in the sense of social reporting). Related to this aim, a series of research projects on the West European welfare state were planned, such as: continuation of the Growth to Limits project, the welfare state of different social categories, such as the farmers (Elmar Rieger), the public employees (Franz Rothenbacher), etc. In addition, comparative projects were developed and organized for selected types of welfare state activities, such as Old Age and Old Age Protection (Jürgen Kohl) and Families and Family Policies (Peter Flora, Alfred J. Kahn, Sheila B. Kamerman). Finally, data collections should be regionalized by the way of a European Social Atlas. = The Rokkanian = Among Flora's early goals was the edition of the writings of his model, of the far too early deceased Norwegian Stein Rokkan. But the idea to publish the collected works of Rokkan was given up, with respect to the fact that Rokkan's publications hid many duplications. Thus, supported by his colleagues Stein Kuhnle and Derek Urwin, they decided to reconstruct from Rokkan's scientific work the essentials of his theory of Europe and to bundle them in the sense of a theory of European state and nation formation. In order to achieve this goal, first all publications of Rokkan's publications were collected and made machine-readable by scanning them (building what is today the Stein Rokkan- archive), with the intention to produce a summarizing book (State Formation, Nation-Building, and Mass Politics in Europe: The Theory of Stein Rokkan. Based on his collected works. Edited by Peter Flora, 1999). This book was first published in English language; afterwards it was translated into the German by Elisabeth Fix and into the Italian by Daniele Caramani. The German pocket book edition, published by Suhrkamp, is a good seller.  Teaching, research, administration—organization  Teaching = In his teachings, Peter Flora, being a representative of macrosociology and historical sociology, mainly devoted himself to the comparative analysis of European societies, with an emphasis on historical-genetic analysis. Single lectures and courses were titled such as: Analysis of the social structure of Europe, State and nation building, or The European welfare state. = Research projects = The list of the research projects stimulated by Peter Flora or carried out by himself (with co-researchers) is long. * During the transition from the 1960s to the 1970s, in cooperation with Wolfgang Zapf, Flora conducted the QUAM-project (Quantitative Model of Modernization) at the University of Frankfurt; results were his doctoral dissertation and furthermore several comparative analyses in English language. * Historical Indicators of Western European Democracies (HIWED), research application still together with Wolfgang Zapf (results: data handbook, dissertations by Jens Alber and Jürgen Kohl, HIWED Working Papers). * Growth to Limits (results: 3 volumes). * Family Change and Family Policies in the West (results: 1 volume for the Anglo-Saxon countries Canada, New Zealand and United States (Sheila B. Kamerman and Alfred J. Kahn); and additional country studies on: a. the Consociational Democracies: Belgium, Switzerland, The Netherlands. b. France and Southern Europe: France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain. c. Central Europe: Austria, the Germanies, Hungary, Poland. d. the Scandinavian welfare states: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden). = Administration—organization = In his long career, Peter Flora has organized a large number of meetings and conferences. One of the most important ones for the MZES was the conference on The New Europe of the Committee on Political Sociology of IPSA and ISA held at the MZES in Mannheim from 21 to 23 February 1991. Participants in this conference were: Peter Flora, Shmuel N. Eisenstadt, Juan Linz, Erik Allardt, Richard Rose, Seymour Martin Lipset, Mattei Dogan , Philippe C. Schmitter, Bernd Schulte, Peter Graf von Kielmansegg, Klaus von Beyme, Stein Ugelvik Larsen, Wlodzimierz Wesolowski, M. Rainer Lepsius, Stein Kuhnle, Wolfgang Streeck, Max Kaase, Franz Urban Pappi, and Hans-Dieter Klingemann.  Memberships  From 1979 to 1982 Peter Flora was editor of the Zeitschrift für Soziologie. From 1987 to 1993 he was Chairman of the Committee on Political Sociology of the International Political Science Association (IPSA) and the International Sociological Association (ISA). Since 1999 he is a member of the Academia Europaea.Homepage of the Academia Europaea  Importance  Peter Flora belongs to the fathers of the renaissance of comparative historical sociology based on macrodata. In Germany he has contributed decisively to redirect German sociology from its occupation with the own nation during the 1970s towards a comparative and European perspective. The systematic comparison of societies in a historical perspective has received decisive impulses from his publications, by his activities in official positions of the sociological profession and as academic teacher, and furthermore by his pioneering role when establishing the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research.

They sent Romeo, Curran, master, into Dover. romeo had been sailing from Virginia to Rotterdam.Lloyd's List, no. 4083, - accessed 20 March 2014. In 1807 Lieutenant John Nops replaced Osmer. On 4 June 1807 Turbulent captured the American schooner Charles. Also in June, Turbulent detained and sent into The Downs the Mount Etna, of Boston, which had been sailing from to Amsterdam.Lloyd's List, no. 4163, - accessed 20 March 2014. In early July Turbulent detained and sent into the Downs the Danish vessel Providence, Richelsen, master.Lloyd's List, no. 4169, - accessed 20 March 2014. Then on 7 September Turbulent was among the vessels present at the seizure of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen. In 1808 Lieutenant George Wood replaced Nops. Under Wood, Turbulent captured three vessels in mid-April: Vier Goschevestern (12 April), Emanuel (13 April) and Enigheden (14 April). On 28 April four Danish ketches, carrying wine and deals, prizes to Turbulent, arrived at Sheerness.Lloyd's List, no. 4247, - accessed 20 March 2014. Turbulent had served for only three years in all before she bore the brunt of a Danish attack whilst on escort duty during the Gunboat War. On 9 June, Turbulent, under Lieutenant George Wood, was one of the escorts for a convoy of 70 merchantmen. (The others were the bomb-vessel Thunder, Captain James Caulfield, 12-gun gun-brig Charger, Lieutenant John Aitkin Blow, and 14-gun gun-brig Piercer, Lieutenant John Sibrell). In the late afternoon the convoy became becalmed off the Danish island of Saltholm, lying between Copenhagen and Malmo Bay.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.74-5. In the Battle of Saltholm, a large force of 21 Danish gunboats and 7 mortar boats came out from Copenhagen to attack the convoy. Only Turbulent, which was bringing up the rear, and Thunder were in a position to resist and after 10 minutes of an exchange of fire, Turbulent had lost her main-top-mast and had had three men wounded. Turbulents resistance saved most of the convoy but the Danes boarded and took her and also 12 merchantmen. Thunder was able to hold off her attackers and they retired with their prizes. The subsequent court martial honorably acquitted Lieutenant Wood for the loss of his ship. Although the Danish gunboats were active, this convoy was the only one to suffer a large loss. Still, the loss of the 12 ships led the British north country merchants to publish a protest in Hull.Voelcker (2008), p.45. The report in Lloyd's List suggests that the Danes captured well more than 12 merchantmen, once one includes Swedish vessels.Lloyd's List, no. 4264, - accessed 20 March 2014. The same report also mentions the capture of Turbulent and , though actually the capture of Tickler by four Danish gunboats occurred five days earlier, on 4 June.

LUM expects that a solution is selected from a set of available solutions based on the amount of effort the solutions require from the user – the user is supposed to select the solution that carries the least effort. The model is applicable to a number of different types of situations, but it can be said to be closely related to technology acceptance models. The model draws from earlier works on how least effort affects human behaviour in information seeking and in scaling of language. Earlier research within the discipline of information systems especially within the topic of technology acceptance and technology adoption is closely related to the lazy user model. The model structure The model starts from the observation that there is a \\"user need\\", i.e. it is expected that there is a \\"clearly definiable, fully satisfiable want\\" that the user wants satisfied (it can also be said that the user has a problem that he/she wants solved). So there is a place for a solution, product, or service. The user need defines the set of possible solutions (products, services etc.) that fulfill the user need. The basic model considers for simplicity needs that are 100% satisfiable and services that 100% satisfy the needs. This means that only the solutions that solve the problem are relevant. This logically means that the need defines the possible satisfying solutions – a set of solutions (many different products/services) that all can fulfill the user need. LUM is not limited to looking at one solution separately. All of the solutions in the set that fulfill the need have their own characteristics; some are good and suitable for the user, others unsuitable and unacceptable – for example, if the user is in a train and wants to know what the result from a tennis match is right now, he/she may only use the types of solutions to the problem that are available to him/her. The \\"user state\\" determines the set of available/suitable solutions for the user and thus limits the (available) set of possible solutions to fulfill the user need. The user state is a very wide concept, it is the user characteristics at the time of the need. The user state includes, e.g., age, wealth, location ... everything that determines the state of the user in relation to the solutions in the set of the possible solutions to fulfill the user need. The model supposes that after the user need has defined the set of possible solutions that fulfill the user need and the user state has limited the set to the available plausible solutions that fulfill the user need the user will \\"select\\" a solution from the set to fulfill the need. Obviously if the set is empty the user does not have a way to fulfill the need. The lazy user model assumes that the user will make the selection from the limited set based on the lowest level of effort. Effort is understood as the combination of monetary cost + time needed + physical/mental effort needed. Considerations The lazy user theory has implications when thinking about the effect of learning in technology adoption (for example in the adoption of new information systems).

It is a complete processor module that currently supports several low-power Intel and PowerPC platforms. Apart from a CPU component, every module also includes memory and a range of serial communication interfaces such as PCI Express, Gigabit Ethernet, USB, SATA, SDVO, LVDS and HD audio. These interfaces are defined in the form factor's specification, and signals are assigned to two 120-pin connectors. This fixed pin mapping ensures that different ESMexpress modules can be exchanged more easily. Consequently, ESMexpress typically does not have an onboard FPGA. The idea behind this is to implement very specialized functions in an FPGA on the COM's carrier board to ease upgrades of the system CPU through exchange of the ESMexpress module. The ESMexpress standard includes only one form factor: 95 x 125 mm. The most important specialty of this computer-on-module is its surrounding mechanical concept, which was designed for especially severe environmental conditions, for example in railway or avionics, or in the automation industry. The large temperature ranges prevalent in such fields of use are met by the modules through a cooling concept that does not need a fan for the CPU: the computer board is embedded into an aluminum frame and cover that can lead the heat off the processor by conduction cooling. At the same time this mechanical set-up provides stability to withstand vibration, but also electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Standardization ESMexpress was undergoing a standardization process managed by the VITA organization to become a standard called 'ANSI/VITA 59 RSE Rugged System-On-Module Express'. For companies that need robust electronic products, both the reduction of development times and a long-term availability of more than 10 or 15 years are significant factors for a new computer-on-module standard like ESMexpress. However, ESMexpress had been based on the existing, popular COM Express, and during the standardization process the work group decided to make better use of this industry popularity. In 2013 the standard's designation was changed into 'VITA 59.00 Rugged COM Express (RCE)'. The specification was completely reviewed but kept the mechanical framework of ESMexpress. The concept now defines the mechanical design to convert standard PICMG COM.0 COM Express CPU boards into VITA 59 Rugged COM Express boards. Although not becoming an official standard, the concept of ESMexpress remains as originally specified and can be regarded a more robust variety of Rugged COM Express, primarily because of the rugged board-to-board connectors. ESMini ESMini is a derivative of ESMexpress. It is based on the same mechanical concept: the computer board is also embedded into an aluminum frame and cover for conduction cooling and EMC protection, and its board-to-board connector types are identical with ESMexpress. The most important difference to ESMexpress is its small size: it is only 95 by 55 mm. Another difference is that it allows greater variations and design flexibility than ESMexpress. Its pin-out is not standardized and the board may include an FPGA which can be used to implement additional interfaces that are not integrated into the onboard processor's chip set.

His recent hits are Last Scandal (내 생애 마지막 스캔들) and IRIS. Jung Jun-ho has a passionate interest in singing. In Last Scandal aired on MBC, Jung sang his character's theme song. MBC's \\"Last Scandal\\" site (Korean) Jung's performance in Last Scandal earned him the title as one of the top excellent actors of 2008. His acting again gained recognition in 2009's hit drama, IRIS. He was crowned as one of the excellent actors. In 2019, he starred in a hit drama Sky Castle. Career Jung Jun-ho started his acting career at 1995. He never thought of entering the entertainment industry and becoming an actor. He admitted that when he was a kid, he was shy and would cry when his teacher placed him in front of the class to sing. After enlisting in the military, he often hosted events. He began to realize his talent - acting. He joined MBC station training class at 1995. Although he worked with many famous stars like Lee Young-ae during the first few years of his acting career, the movies and series he made in the first few years did not lend him much limelight; he remained in obscurity. Feeling discouraged, he had thoughts of retiring from the entertainment industry. After all, he considered himself as an introvert. His personality might not be suitable as an actor. In 2000, he landed a role in television series, Women Like You (왕추). The series propelled him to stardom. At the same year, he was cast in My Boss, My Hero. To his surprise, the movie not only received high box office record but also solidified his star power. Due to his success with his comedic role in My Boss, My Hero, he was cast in many more comedic roles in series and movies between 2002 and 2006. All of them were pretty successful. His comedic image was deeply engraved in fans' mind. However, he felt typecast and hoped for a change of image and a breakthrough in his career. He questioned himself which career route he wished to head down and which new image he wanted to develop. In 2005, a director suggested him to play a villain in Another Public Enemy. His performance stunned his fans and the media. They never knew that Jung Jun- ho could play a villainous side. The positive remarks he received from his fans and media boosted his confidence in his acting. In 2008 and 2009, he gave outstanding performances in Last Scandal and IRIS.

Since then, they have become very good friends. Sometimes, they would discuss movie or drama series scripts with each other before deciding on whether to accept the offer to film the movie or series. In 2010, they reunited after their last collaboration 10 years ago, to film a comedic cop movie similar to the American movie, Rush Hour, titled Mr. George and Bongsik.

Holding mineral rights to large quantities of land in the Edmonton area, Harvie made a fortune after the oil discoveries at Leduc in 1947 and Redwater in 1948. After 1955 Harvie devoted himself primarily to cultural and philanthropic endeavors. He is best remembered as the founder of the Glenbow Museum and Devonian Gardens in Calgary, which opened in 1966. Biography Early life and education = Eric Lafferty Harvie was born on 2 April 1892 in a house located at 136 Matchedash Street in Orillia, Ontario to William McLeod Harvie and Elizabeth Cecile \\"Cicely\\" Lafferty. Eric was the fourth of five children, Alan, Ruth, and Jean his elders, and Dane his junior. William Harvie (1856-1919) was a dentist in Orillia who served as they town mayor from 1891 to 1892, and Cicely Harvie (1859-1940) was a school teacher. Eric Harvie was a fourth-generation Canadian. His great grandfather, John Harvey (1788-1872), had immigrated to Canada from Caldermill, Scotland in 1832 with his wife Agnes Miller (1790-1863). The Harveys landed in Montréal and ended up settling in the Orillia area. Eric Harvie's parents married in 1883. For an unknown reason, Cicely demanded that William - whose last name at this time was spelled \\"Harvey\\" - change the spelling to \\"Harvie\\" prior to their marriage. Eric Harvie first visited Calgary in 1905, travelling with his mother to visit her siblings Janet and James Delamere Lafferty, both of whom had moved west. James was a doctor and served on Calgary's first city council, and Janet was married to the lawyer James Short. Harvie graduated high school in 1911 and entered into the Articles of Clerkship with John Thomas Mulcahy. Shortly thereafter Harvie was admitted into the Law Society of Upper Canada. Not long after joining Mulcahy, however, Harvie had decided to move to Calgary, and wrote a letter to the Law Society of Alberta asking to be admitted as a student. On 25 January 1912 Harvie was accepted. In Calgary, Harvie lived with James Lafferty and began articling at James Short's office, Short, Ross and Selwood. Harvie completed his intermediate examinations in the springs of 1913 and 1914 and his finals in the spring of 1915. On 30 June 1915, Harvie was granted his interim certificate, and received his Bachelor of Laws from the University of Alberta on 10 May 1916, in absentia. = World War I = Following Canada's entrance in to the First World War on 4 August 1914, Harvie enlisted in the 15th Alberta Light Horse. He was later transferred into the 56th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force and left for training in England on 20 March 1916. By that fall Harvie was in France. On 8 October 1916 Harvie was injured in the Battle of Ancre Heights. Fighting with the 49th Battalion (Edmonton Regiment) under the command of W. A. Griesbach, Harvie participated in an assault on the Regina Trench in the early hours of that morning. The attack lasted most of the day and was largely unsuccessful. During the attack Harvie was injured and was forced to hide himself in shell holes until the evening, at which time stretcher bearers were able to evacuate the wounded. Harvie was sent back to England to recover, and on 1 February 1917 returned to Canada on sick leave, staying with his parents in Barrie. Fully recovered, on 2 August 1917 Harvie entered into the Royal Flying Corps Canada, training at Camp Borden and Deseronto. Following his training he was sent to Fort Worth, Texas to supervise the development of the synchronized machine gun. During his stay in Texas Harvie became friends with Vernon Castle. Following this assignment Harvie returned to Beamsville, Ontario where he stayed, acting as a temporary captain of the 49th Battalion, until 17 December 1918, at which time he returned to Calgary and was demobilized. = Marriage and early career = In June 1918, while on leave in Hamilton Harvie met Dorothy Jean Southam, the granddaughter of newspaper publisher William Southam. Dorothy Southam (1895-1988) was born and raised in Montréal growing up at 57 Belvedere Road, and had attended finishing school in New York City. After a short courtship, Harvie asked Southam to marry him. After spending the early part of 1919 in Calgary the couple returned to Montréal where they married on 29 September 1919, and afterwards spent a two-week honeymoon at Loon Lake. Returning to Calgary following the honeymoon, the Harvies sought to establish themselves in the city, building at home at 301 36th Avenue (now Elbow Park Lane) South West. At this time Harvie became the junior partner in the firm Ford, Miller and Harvie, with partners Clinton Ford and Leo Miller. Harvie's law practice flourished throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as he built an extensive clientele. This clientele included many oil companies, as well as wealthy businessmen such as Chester de la Verge, who was living in Calgary, and Errett Cord, who was hunting for oil in Alberta. In 1935 Harvie left his partners and formed his own practice, and from 1936 to 1939 had Ted Manning as a partner. Later in 1939 Harvie took on George Crawford as a partner, and then in 1940 Ted Arnold, at which time the firm became known as Harvie, Arnold and Crawford, which it would remain until Harvie's retirement from law. From a young age Harvey developed a keen interest in oil exploration. The young law student had been living in Calgary for two years when the Dingman No. 1 gas well blew in Turner Valley on 14 May 1914, starting Calgary's first boom period. Upon establishing his law practice in 1920, Harvie became active in the oil and gas business as well, being involved with numerous exploration ventures, most of which were unsuccessful. Between 1925 and 1933 Harvie served as the director of W. S. Herron's Okalta Oils, and in 1933 he became the solicitor for British-American Oil Company's ventures in Turner Valley. British-American and Harvie were both involved in the financing of the Royalite No. 1 well, which blew in on 16 June 1936, becoming Alberta's first major oil discovery. = Leduc discovery = In the summer of 1941 Harvie purchased for $2,840.64 the mineral rights to a portion of land in the Edmonton area. The mineral rights had been owned by Anglo-Western Oils, a subsidiary of the British Dominion Land Settlement Corporation, and both companies had been bankrupted and needed to sell off the rights. In 1943, Harvie purchased the rights to the remaining portion for $10,000. The area totaled 487,967.99 acres. Harvie was initially nervous about the investment and concluded that he would have to make $100,000 for the investment to pay off after taxes. Although he initially used the rights to extract gravel, in 1946 he leased oil rights to Shell Oil Company, with an option for three additional years. Shell's seismographs did not detect oil, and the company backed out after a year. In 1947, Harvie leased oil rights on a portion of land to Imperial Oil Company, with a five-year option. On 13 February 1947 Imperial's Leduc No. 1 blew in, tapping into a large Devonian reef. Harvie became a millionaire overnight. A year later Harvie leased oil rights in the Redwater region to a consortium of companies - Barnsdall Oil Company, Honolulu Oil Corporation, Seaboard Oil Company, and Los Nietos Company - going by the name of the Barnsdall Group. In September 1948 Barnsdall's \\"Discovery Well\\" in Redwater blew in, tapping into another Devonian field, making it the second major strike on Harvie's land. In 1949 Harvie retired from law and dedicated his time exclusively to oil. Following the Leduc and Redwater discoveries he remained active in the oil business for several years. His company, Western Leaseholds, went public in 1951, and in 1955 Harvie sold his control of the company to Petrofina for the price of $20,000,000. In the ensuing years Harvie continued to explore for oil with his company Western Minerals. = Philanthropy and the Glenbow = Following the sale of Western Leaseholds in 1955, Harvie dedicated increasing time to his collecting hobby, which he had had since a young age. Now able to travel, Harvie acquired an eclectic array of antiquities from across the world. In 1964 he first displayed his collection in the temporary location of Calgary's \\"second\\" courthouse. In 1966 he officially founded the Glenbow Alberta Institute with an endowment of over $10,000,000. Although the museum has objects from a wide range of cultures, its primary focus is Western-Canadian culture and heritage. Harvie joked that he wanted to die broke, and thus turned the majority of his wealth back to the province in the form of gifts. Other projects paid for by Harvie's Devonian Foundation include the Confederation Centre of the Arts, Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, Devonian Gardens, and the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum. In 1962 Harvie was made an honorary chief of the Blackfoot Nation, and in 1967 he was made an officer of the Order of Canada. = Personal life = Harvie lived in Calgary until his death in 1975. He and his wife Dorothy had three children: Joy (1922-2014), Donald (1924-2001), and Neil (1929-1999). In 1934 Harvie acquired the Glenbow Ranch near Cochrane, Alberta, comprising 2200 acres of land. The ranch had belonged to his client Chester de la Vergne since 1905, and had originally been purchased by Matthew Cochrane in 1880. After de la Vergne had gotten into financial trouble following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, a deal was worked out that saw the land turned over to Harvie. The Harvie family spent extensive time at the ranch, which was eventually taken over by Neil. Eric Harvie died on 11 January 1975 at the age of 82. Harvie's papers are held at the Glenbow Museum as the Eric Harvie fonds. Bibliography * Diehl, Fred M. A Gentleman from a Fading Age: Eric Lafferty Harvie. Calgary: Devonian Foundation, 1989.

Goldman David Paul Goldman (born September 27, 1951) is an American economist, music critic, and author, best known for his series of online essays in the Asia Times under the pseudonym Spengler. The pseudonym is an allusion to German historian Oswald Spengler, whose most famous work, Decline of the West (1918), asserted that Western civilization was already dying. Goldman says that he writes from a Judeo-Christian perspective and often focuses on demographic and economic factors in his analyses; he says his subject matter proceeds \\"from the theme formulated by [Franz] Rosenzweig: the mortality of nations and its causes, Western secularism, Asian anomie, and unadaptable Islam.\\" On March 14, 2015, Goldman and longtime Asia Times associate Uwe Von Parpart took control of Asia Times HK Ltd. Early life and education Goldman was born in the United States, in a non-religious Jewish family. He earned his bachelor's degree at Columbia University in 1973, and a master's degree in music theory at the City University of New York. He studied economics at the London School of Economics in 1976. Career From 1976 to 1982, Goldman was responsible for economic publications in the Lyndon LaRouche movement. Goldman has described himself during that period as a radical and an atheist. After leaving the LaRouche movement, he became a conservative, and worked for the Reagan administration and later on Wall Street. Since 1984, Goldman has been employed as an economist and CEO of investment funds and investment policies in senior positions in bodies such as Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Cantor Fitzgerald, Asteri Capital, and SG Capital. After leaving Wall Street, he became an editor for First Things magazine. In September 2013, Goldman became a Managing Director and head of the Americas division of the Reorient Group investment bank based in Hong Kong. As an economist, Goldman published hundreds of articles and studies on various economic subjects, in professional journals as well as journals and dailies such as The Wall Street Journal, Commentary, and Bloomberg Businessweek. He was a columnist for Forbes from 1994 to 2001. Alongside his work as an economist and analyst, he has published articles in musicology journals and other publications and written several books. Between 2002 and 2011, Goldman served as a member of the board of directors of Mannes School of Music, where he was formerly a teacher. He is the Wax Family Fellow at the Middle East Forum, a Senior Fellow at the London Center for Policy Research, and a member of the Board of Advisors of Sino- Israel Government Network and Academic Leadership (SIGNAL).SIGNAL, Board of Academic & Expert Advisors Media According to the Claremont Review of Books, the \\"Spengler\\" columns in the Asia Times have attracted readership in the millions. Goldman concealed his identity under the \\"Spengler\\" pseudonym until 2009, when he revealed his identity in the Asia Times article, \\"And Spengler is…\\" and the First Things article \\"Confessions of a Coward\\". Goldman regularly appears as a guest on CNBC's Larry Kudlow Program, where he has been an outspoken critic of Federal Reserve efforts to resuscitate the American economy. In \\"Dumb and Dumber\\", a widely commented upon piece for Tablet magazine in May 2013, Goldman argued how both Republican and Democratic foreign policy elite in the United States have wrongly put their faith in the so-called Arab Spring. In Goldman's view, economic and demographic realities could condemn many Arab states to state failure. In \\"Deplorably, Trump is going to win\\", published in Asia Times about two months before the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, Goldman correctly predicted Donald Trump would win the presidency.

Bulgarians were sometimes taken captive during Byzantine raids and resettled in Asia Minor (modern Asian Turkey), but their traces are lost in the Middle Ages. As the Balkans were subjugated by the Ottomans, the entirety of the Bulgarian lands fell under Ottoman domination. It was during the Ottoman rule that a more substantial Bulgarian colony was formed in the imperial capital Istanbul (also known as Constantinople or, in Bulgarian, as Tsarigrad). The so-called \\"Tsarigrad Bulgarians\\" (цариградски българи, tsarigradski balgari) were mostly craftsmen (e.g. leatherworkers) and merchants. During the Bulgarian National Revival, Istanbul was a major centre of Bulgarian journalism and enlightenment. Istanbul's St Stephen Church, also known as the Bulgarian Iron Church, was the seat of the Bulgarian Exarchate after 1870. According to some estimates, the Tsarigrad Bulgarians numbered 30–100,000 in the mid-19th century; today, there remains a small colony of 300–400, a small part of the city's Bulgarian community. A specific part of the Bulgarian population of modern Turkey were the Anatolian Bulgarians, Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians who settled in Ottoman-ruled northwestern Anatolia, possibly in the 18th century, and remained there until 1914. Much more intense was the fate of the Bulgarian population of Eastern Thrace in the Ottoman Province (vilâyet) of Edirne. According to Lyubomir Miletich's detailed study of the province published in 1918, the Bulgarian population of the province (today mostly in Turkey, with smaller parts in Greece and Bulgaria) in 1912 numbered 298,726, of whom 176,554 Exarchists, 24,970 Patriarchists, 1,700 Eastern Catholics and 95,502 Muslims (Pomaks). In the Çorlu and Constantinople regions, Miletich estimates the Bulgarian population at a further 10,000. After the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, most of the Bulgarian population was killed or expelled by the Ottomans to Bulgarian-controlled territories. The legal property rights of the expelled Thracian Bulgarians were recognized fully by the Republic of Turkey through the Treaty of Ankara, signed on October 18, 1925, but have been never denied or enforced yet.Terziev, Svetoslav. \\"The Thracian Bulgarians press Turkey in EU\\" , Sega Newspaper, September 19, 2007. Accessed September 20, 2007. Almost one century after 1913, the heirs of the Bulgarian refugees have still not been compensated yet. After the Balkan Wars some Turks left Bulgaria and a number of Bulgarians moved from Ottoman Turkey to Bulgaria. Between the Balkan Wars and the First World War there were a series of agreements on exchanges of population between Bulgaria and Turkey.R. J. Crampton: \\"Bulgaria\\" 2007 pp.431 Present There remain two Bulgarian Orthodox churches in the city of Edirne: Saint George (dating to 1880) and Saints Constantine and Helena (built in 1869). The Bulgarian churches were reconstructed in the 2000s with the cooperation of Turkey, using mostly Bulgarian state funds. They are both in a good condition today; Saint George also has a Bulgarian library and an ethnographic collection. In September 2007 Evgeni Kirilov, Bulgarian deputy in the European Parliament, proposed an amendment to the resolution concerning the EU-Turkish relations, which refers to the property of the Thracian Bulgarians and the obligations of Turkish authorities according to the Treaty of Ankara.\\"Evgeni Kirilov proposed an amendment about the Thracian Bulgarians in an official report in European Parliament about Turkey\\", Information Agency Focus, September 18, 2007.

It was produced by Harry Novak.IMDb: Mantis in Lace (1968) At least two differently edited versions have been released, one of which has more emphasis on sex and one of which emphasizes violence.Eccentric Cinema: Mantis In Lace Per the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), the movie was released under the title, Lila, which coincides with the movie's opening scene also crediting the film's title as Lila. Plot \\"Lila\\" ‒ played by Susan Stewart ‒ is a seemingly good-natured go-go dancer who strips at a seedy topless bar on the Sunset Strip. After taking LSD, Lila becomes a psychopathic serial killer. She continues to pick up men at the bar where she is employed, but after her sanity is lost she routinely is interrupted mid-coitus by psychedelic bad trips in which she visualizes a balding, half-naked old man clutching wads of cash in one hand and a bunch of bananas in the other. These psychotic episodes cause her to murder her partners by stabbing them with a screwdriver and dismembering them with a rusty meat cleaver (or in one case, a garden hoe) while imagining that she is cutting up cantaloupes and watermelons.Monster Hunter: Mantis in Lace As pieces of the victims' bodies are discovered in cardboard boxes, she is pursued by a pair of Los Angeles Police Department detectives played by Steven Vincent and M.K. Evans. The narrative is interrupted by long sequences of topless dancing, softcore pornography, and recreational drug use.

Taglines One tagline for the film was \\"Let her show you the heat of desire — the face of sin!\\" The movie poster includes two additional taglines. The first, in large typeface, says \\"SHE LOVED THEM..and loved them and loved them TO DEATH.\\" The second tagline refers to the sexually cannibalistic tendencies of mantises and warns \\"Like a female MANTIS...to love her was to DIE!\\" Reviews Mantis in Lace has been described as \\"a truly bizarre movie\\" and \\"a very strange trip ...(with) lots of tits and little sense\\"; the review further warns: > The acting is either terrible or nonexistent. The same can be said for the > direction and editing. The music score, relying chiefly on an electric > guitarist who seems to be making up stuff as he goes along — none of it > worthy of the term \\"improvisation\\", mind you — lurches from quirky kitsch to > agonizing irritant very quickly.

England. They built trawlers and other small ships.  History  Founding and move to Beverley = The firm was founded in 1883 on South Bridge Road, Hull, on the Humber bank. The founding partners were William James Cook, Charles Keen Welton and William Gemmell. In 1901–1902 the business moved nine miles up the River Hull to a new yard at Grovehill, Beverley purchased from Cochrane, Hamilton & Cooper. The yard had been founded by Andrew Cochrane in 1884. It was one of the few shipyards that launched broadside. = Prosperity and decline = The new yard initially produced trawlers and whalers with dredging of the River Hull allowing larger ships to be built. During both world wars it built large numbers of ships such as minesweepers and anti-submarine trawlers for the Royal Navy. Between the wars it consolidated its reputation as a builder of high quality trawlers and continued to prosper into the 1950s. In 1954 the shipyard employed 650 workers and built 15 vessels (including three minesweepers, four trawlers, and a tug), but by 1960 the workforce had declined to 600 and after struggling to find orders Cook, Welton & Gemmell built their last ship in 1962 and went into voluntary liquidation in 1963. = Changes of ownership = The firm was taken over by Charles D. Holmes & Co in March 1963 and the company name changed to Beverley Shipbuilding and Engineering Co Ltd. C D Holmes was subsequently taken over in July 1973 by Drypool Group, which in turn went into liquidation in 1975. The yard was then taken over by Whitby Shipyard Ltd on 1 July 1976. That company changed its name to Phoenix Shipbuilders Ltd in December 1976 and had a receiver appointed in May 1977, resulting in the closure of the Beverley yard with nearly 180 redundancies. The site reverted to the ground landlords, Beverley Borough Council, and was later developed as the Acorn Industrial Estate.

(1740–1815) was an English clergyman, school teacher and college principal, antiquarian, and man of letters. Life Born in England, he began his career when he was recruited as a professor of moral philosophy for the College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. He arrived in 1770.J. David Hoeveler, Creating the American Mind: Intellect and Politics in the Colonial Colleges (2007), p. 286. Well-connected there, he became a friend of Thomas Jefferson, who acquired some of his library.Kevin J. Hayes, The Road to Monticello: The Life and Mind of Thomas Jefferson (2008), p. 523. He clashed though in public debate with Robert Carter Nicholas, Sr. and John Page, and failed to become rector of Bruton Parish Church.http://www.history.org/Almanack/people/bios/biohenly.cfm In 1775 he went back to England, as a Loyalist taking leave from the College but never returning; he was a supporter of John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, Virginia's governor, and with his colleague Thomas Gwatkin had been subject to intimidation by armed men.John E. Selby, Don Higginbotham, The Revolution in Virginia, 1775-1783 (2007), p. 46.http://www.wm.edu/about/history/chronology/1750to1799/index.php He obtained an assistant-mastership at Harrow School, and soon afterwards received a curacy at Northall in Middlesex. In 1778 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and four years later he was presented to the living of Rendlesham in Suffolk. He continued to spend the greater part of his time at Harrow. Henley maintained an extensive correspondence on antiquarian and classical subjects with Michael Tyson, Richard Gough, Dawson Turner, Thomas Percy, and other scholars of the time. In 1805 he was appointed principal of the newly established East India Company College at Hertford. He resigned this post in January 1815, and died on 29 December of the same year. He married in 1780 a daughter of Thomas Figgins, esq., of Chippenham, Wiltshire. Works In 1779 Henley edited Travels in the Two Sicilies, by Henry Swinburne. In 1784 he published with notes an English translation of Vathek, written (but as yet unpublished) by William Thomas Beckford. The French original was not published till 1787. Stephen Weston stated in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1784 that Vathek had been composed by Henley himself as a text 'for the purpose of giving to the public the information contained in the notes.' Henley replied that his book was merely a translation from an unpublished French manuscript. Beckford, in the preface to the French version of 1815, mentions that the appearance of the English translation before his original was not his intention, and only attributes it to circumstances \\"peu intéressantes pour le public\\". Henley was a frequent contributor to the Monthly Magazine. He also occasionally wrote short poems for private circulation among his friends.

It is in the ecclesiastical province of Dublin. HistoryEarly history= It is said that in the year 480 (35 years after Saint Patrick settled in Armagh) Saint Brigid arrived in Kildare with her nuns. Her original abbey church may have been a simple wooden building. Soon after her death in 523 A.D., a costly shrine was erected in her honour in a new and larger building. For many centuries Kildare maintained a unique Irish experiment; the Abbess ruled over a double community of women and men, and the Bishop was subordinate in jurisdiction to the abbess. Between the years 835 and 998 the cathedral was devastated approximately 16 times, so that when the Norman, Ralph of Bristol, became bishop in 1223 it was virtually in ruins. Between then and 1230 it was largely rebuilt, likely in the years following 1223, and probably by Ralph of Bristol who was made Bishop of the see in 1222 and died in 1232. Still semi-ruinous by 1500, it was derelict by 1649. In 1686 it was partially rebuilt.Free-sheet provided to visitors to self guide tour the cathedral. =Demise and resurrection= The Cathedral fell into disrepair following the 16th century English Reformation, and was ruined during the 17th century Irish Confederate Wars.\\"The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland\\" Day, J.G.F./ Patton, H.E. p99: London, S.P.C.K., 1932 A near complete restoration of the building was undertaken during the 19th century by George Edmund StreetMemoir of George Edmund Street, R.A., b.1824-d.1881, Arthur Edmund Street. He started restoration work on the Cathedral in 1875, and work continued after his death in 1881 until it was complete in 1896. These works included a new north transept, new chancel, and new west wall as well as rebuilding three sides of the square tower. A new oak roof (which is supported on stone corbels) was built into the wall buttresses. As part of the Cathedral's centenary, the building underwent further restoration including new internal porches, repairs to internal and external stonework and rebuilding of the organ.http://kildare.ie/Local-History/kildare/kildare- cathedral.htm Current status and layout Previously the cathedral of the Diocese of Kildare, it is now one of two cathedrals in the United Dioceses of Meath and Kildare. The present building is a restored Norman cathedral dating from 1223. The site occupied by the cathedral is likely the site of a pagan shrine to the goddess Brigid and the later of the church of Saint Brigid. A perpetual flame was kept here from pre-Christian times possibly until the time of Henry VIII, who destroyed many monasteries. Beside the cathedral stands one of County Kildare's five round towers which is high, and which can be climbed at certain times. The cathedral is cruciform in plan without aisles in the early gothic style with a massive square central tower. All the windows are lancet windows, singles or doubles, but triple lancets in the four gables. Design features include arches which span between buttress to buttress in advance of the side walls. The parapets are of the stepped Irish type (now much restored) but probably datable to c. 1395, the year in which a Papal relaxation was given to those who visited Kildare and gave alms for the conservation of the church. The interior treatment is plain, the window splays are not moulded, but the rear-arches, which are, spring from shafts with moulded capitals. These shafts are short and terminate in small curved tails.Irish Churches and Monastic Buildings – Volume II – by Harold G. Leask MArch, Litt.D., M.R.I.A., F.S.A., F.R.S.A.I., F.R.I.A.I.. Features Features of the Cathedral include: * An altar-tomb effigy of Bishop Walter Wellesley (died 1539) which is an example of 16th century sculpture * A Sheelagh-na-gig (nude carving), which is unusual to find in cathedrals * Solid oak stalls for the choir and chapter with acorn and oak leaf carvings. * The Bishops throne. * A high-altar area with reproductions of the medieval originals. * Carved Caen Stone pulpit with carvings of the four evangelists and Irish marble columns. * The Lady Chapel. * The organ which was built by Conacher in 1898 * St. Luke stained glass window by Gerda Schurmann (from Czech Republic) dated 1974. * A stone baptismal font which is not original to the Cathedral but is dated from Medieval period. * The west window, dedicated to St. Patrick, St. Brigid and St. Columba.

The interactive exhibit brings the army’s popular computer game, America’s Army: Special Forces (Overmatch), to a life-size, networked environment to provide visitors with an experience of soldiering. Using computers, LAN based scenarios, motion simulators, and videos, the VAE is a display of technological invention. The VAE was greeted with enthusiasm by the public for its design, use of measurement technology, and its ability to engage visitors through an entertaining and educational experience. The dual use of the virtual environment with tracking technology is a combination that commercial marketers could learn from, say experts, especially those marketers who target young adults. The VAE is managed by the Army’s Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA) at the United States Military Academy, West Point. OEMA director Colonel Casey Wardynski is the originator of the Army Game Project. The army spent about $9 million building four versions of the Virtual Army Experience, Col. Wardynski said. Col. Wardynski envisioned \\"using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining.\\" Overview The VAE allows visitors the opportunity to “test drive” soldiering in a mission drawn from Army operations. The core of the VAE is the America’s Army computer game, mentioned above. The exhibit is rendered with Army training simulation technology to create a life-size, networked virtual environment. In the 20-minute ride, participants receive video briefings by soldiers who span the expertise, backgrounds and personal goals of typical soldiers. The VAE highlights soldier occupations, Army technologies, operating environments and missions. Participants employ teamwork, rules of engagement, leadership and high-tech equipment as they take part in a virtual U.S. Army mission. The experience \\"is fun and interactive ... while effectively telling a brand story of teamwork, honor and respect,\\" says Drew Neisser, CEO of Renegade, an experiential marketing agency. \\"Commercial clients should try to replicate this model ... which gives users a realistic view of what the brand is about.\\" The VAE can be delivered in its full scale rendition, or may be broken down into two smaller versions, enabling it to travel to events simultaneously. There are four traveling packages that offer indoor/outdoor experiences and allow the VAE to travel year round across the United States. In two years, the VAE has traveled to over 40 states, at locales including NASCAR races, Six Flags Amusement Parks, State Fairs, Spring Break festivities, Music Festivals, Air Shows and Urban Expos. It cost $9.8 million a year to operate the exhibits. Exhibit Inside the , full-size version of the VAE, visitors participate in an eight- minute-long virtual operation in which they fire at virtual human and vehicle targets using life-sized, recoil action air rifles from inside life-sized Blackhawk helicopters and combat vehicle simulators as members of a team in an Army mission. According to their website, the roof of the VAE is an inflatable dome that provides an environmentally controlled, sound dampened environment which holds over 230 visitors per-hour. Visitors enter crew stations in one of six HMMWV simulators, similar to vehicles employed by Army Special Forces, and one of two full-size replicas of UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopters. Each HMMWV and Black Hawk simulator is surrounded by large screens providing a 180-degree battlefield upon which the virtual mission is displayed. HMMWV participants use replica M4 Rifles or M249 SAWs (Squad Automatic Weapons) that are wired to laser engagement systems similar to existing computerized marksmanship trainers. Other participants enter UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters where they use light arms and provide air coverage against enemy forces. The simulator features effects such as the HMMWV pitching, shaking and vibrations as it moves over the virtual terrain, simulated explosions caused by enemy fire and IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices). Players fire air-pressured guns that mimic the recoil and kickback of real ones. The simulated weapons do not mimic the heat or smell of the real guns, however, and never jam. The experience lasts 20–30 minutes, and requires that participants register with the VAE if they wish to use the simulator. This registration enables local Army recruiters to track individual participants after the event, and it also feeds into a statistical database which enables long-term analysis of trends. In conjunction with this registration process, RFID real-time tracking devices which are given to participants and developed by Fish Software enables event managers to identify and follow potential leads for Army recruiting as they make their way through the Experience. The VAE also includes activities ranging from multiplayer versions America's Army and, at select locations, MARCbot Robot operator training and a robot agility course. Throughout, Army recruiters and employees of the marketing firm, Ignited Minds, guide activities and stand ready to discuss soldiering with participants. The Experience Once a team of visitors gathers in the Assembly Area, uniformed members of the VAE staff guide visitors to the “Joint Operations Center.” In the center visitors meet former soldiers, employees of marketing firm Ignited Minds, who serve as their team leaders. These employees give visitors an intelligence briefing video and talk about the upcoming virtual mission. This briefing also covers teamwork, Army rules of engagement, and proper use of equipment within the simulator. Videos prepare visitors to enter a virtual combat operation by providing them with on-the-ground intelligence about their mission. Following this briefing, visitors move to the Mission Simulator. Working as a team, participants complete a civilian evacuation operation. Upon completion, participants move to the After Action Review area where they receive a debriefing on their performances. Real soldiers and Ignited employees review their team’s performance during the mission and highlight areas such as teamwork or communication where visitors could have performed better. Team Leaders also emphasize the role Army values, such as duty, respect and honor, play in mission accomplishment. To add authenticity to the experience, visitors at select locations are introduced to a soldier who has distinguished himself in combat and earned citations for bravery and valor. This soldier briefly shares his or her experiences with visitors, after which visitors watch a short video that re-enacts the soldier’s heroic acts in combat. According to Sergeant Tommy Rieman, “people have a general perception about the army before they enter (the VAE) and when they leave they have a greater appreciation.” Some veterans complain that the experience is misleading - that it trivializes their real combat experience. Critics say the Army's videogames don't give an accurate portrayal of war and Army life. \\"War is not a game,\\" said Sholom Keller, national membership coordinator for Iraq Veterans Against the War, who said he served in the Army from 2001 to 2005 and fought in Afghanistan and Iraq. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has found that Army use of the game, and its recruiting practice in general, violate international law. In May, the ACLU published a report that found the armed services \\"regularly target children under 17 for military recruitment. Department of Defense instructions to its recruiters and the US military's collection of information of hundreds of thousands of 16-year-olds, and the military training corps for children as young as 11, all reveal that students are targeted for recruitment as early as possible. By exposing children under 17 to military recruitment, the United States military violates the Optional Protocol.\\" The Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, ratified by the Senate in December 2002, protects the rights of children under 16 from military recruitment and deployment to war.American Civil Liberties Union report on US Violations of Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict: Sons of Misfortune: Abusive US Military Recruitment and Failure to Protect Child Soldiers, May 23, 2008 Prior to exiting, visitors receive a free copy of the America’s Army PC game so, if desired, they can join the game's online community and continue to explore the Army at home by playing the game. Private corporations like Ubisoft reap handsome profits from the Army's project to train and recruit children.

In 1923 the name became The Post Office and Civil Service Sanatorium Society, as the membership was opened to a new industry. In October 1990, the registered office moved from London to York. On 1 January 2010, the Society changed its name to the Benenden Healthcare Society.Original rules filed with the Registrar of Mutual Societies at https://mutuals.fca.org.uk/Search/Search?searchLink=true&page;=2&SocietyId;=16914&SearchTerm;=The%20Benenden%20Healthcare%20Society%20Limited Membership was restricted to those employed in the public sector, both at national and local level, which led to difficulties as many functions were being outsourced and, consequently, membership began to decline. In June 2012, delegates at Benenden Health's annual conference in Manchester voted to remove restrictions on membership. Also in June 2012, Benenden Health became shirt sponsor of York City Football Club. This sponsorship ended in the summer of 2019. In early 2018, the Society rebranded using the trading style \\"Benenden Health\\". Benenden Hospital Benenden Hospital was founded in 1907 near Benenden, Kent as a sanatorium location for tuberculosis treatment and became a centre for hospital treatment for members of Trade Unions and Friendly Societies, and subsequently public sector employees. Benenden Hospital in its original form as ‘Benenden Sanatorium’ was designed by Augustus William West, following pre-Bauhaus principles. The building is an example of early British modernist architecture. The hospital is now administered by Benenden Hospital Trust and is used by local National Health Service agencies and patients who use private medical insurance or who pay directly for their own hospital care. It is also one of a national network of 26 hospital facilities at which Benenden Health can authorise surgical and other treatment procedures. The hospital was rated outstanding by the Care Quality Commission in May 2017. 22% of its activity is now commissioned by the NHS, mostly orthopaedic, gynaecology and ophthalmology surgery for adults.

After establishing himself as a sought after figure on the British folk revival scene, Jones recorded Penguin Eggs with producer Tony Engle; it consists of traditional folk songs arranged by Jones. Exemplified throughout the album is Jones' intricate acoustic guitar playing style, characterised by a distinctive, percussive plucking style and use of open tunings. He also plays fiddle on one song, while he is joined on many tracks by Tony Hall on melodeon and Bridget Danby on recorder. Released to critical acclaim, the album was awarded Melody Maker Folk Album of the Year in 1980. It was ultimately Jones' last album, as a car crash in 1982 greatly restricted his ability to perform. In the years after its release, the album gained a cult following and has been hailed as a masterpiece and influence on contemporary folk musicians. Allmusic has described the album as \\"one of those rare records where not just every song, but each instrumental part is worth hearing\\". English folk musician Kate Rusby states that Penguin Eggs is her favourite album of all time, while Stewart Lee has ranked it among his favourite albums. It was named the second best folk album of all time in a 2001 BBC poll. Background Folk musician and singer Nic Jones first emerged in the late 1960s as a member the trio The Halliard, who achieved a Spanish hit with \\"The Irish in Me\\" but soon split up when its members fancied different career paths. Jones began a solo career, taking strong influence from Martin Carthy, whose percussive style of guitar playing was adopted by Jones for his own work. Jones signed to Bill and Helen Leader's record label Trailer, who released his first album Ballads and Songs (1970), which consisted of traditional tunes that highlighted Jones' instrumental skill and \\"mastery of the long ballad.\\" Trailer also issued his following albums Nic Jones (1971) and the much later Noah Ark's Trap (1977) and From the Devil a Stranger (1978), while throughout the decade, Jones had established himself as one of the British folk revival's most acclaimed artists, and one of the scene's most sought after solo performers. Part of Jones' style was regularly writing his own material and discreetly passing it off as traditional folk music. This was consistent with Jones \\"turning his back\\" on his audience if he felt they were not paying attention, where in such instances he would sing gibberish or play the same song two times in a row to see if people would notice, which he later claimed they didn't. Jones said: \\"People didn't want me to write my own songs, they only wanted to hear traditional material. Other times I'd rewrite traditional songs or stick in new verses. Nobody ever knew.\\" His 1977 album Noah's Ark Trap gave many indications as to the direction Jones would take on Penguin Eggs. After leaving the Trailer label, Jones recorded Penguin Eggs at Livingston Recording Studios in late 1979. It was produced by Tony Engle, who also designed the album's packaging, and engineered by Nic Kinsey. Billy Kinsley also helped engineer. Music Paul Metsers (pictured 1981) who wrote \\"Farewell to the Gold\\". Penguin Eggs is a work of the English folk revival, and consists largely of traditional songs, English, Irish and Scottish, and one Irish instrumental, \\"Planxty Davis\\". The instrumentation is entirely acoustic and dominated by Jones' acoustic guitar. The singer's virtuoso acoustic guitar playing on the album is elegant, brawny and lyrical. As with Jones' previous work, an integral aspect to his intricate playing style is the recurring percussive sound achieved by striking downwards using the middle or ring fingers on his right hand onto damped bass strings near or above the guitar bridge, a technique similar to the 'frailing' of a banjo. His modern guitar arrangements on Penguin Eggs display a contemporary feel, and he makes inventive use of progressive open tunings on the album, including DADGAD, though he generally preferred tunings in C and G. Although Jones' guitar work forms the basis on the album, musical support is provided on several tracks by Tony Hall on melodeon and Bridget Danby on recorder. Jones himself also plays the fiddle on \\"Barrack Street\\". According to Bruce Eder of AllMusic, Jones' singing, \\"some of the most expressive to emerge from the English folk revival,\\" bare a richness that recalls young Martin Carthy but also hints of a roughness that is reminiscent of A.L. Lloyd and Paul Clayton, while the harmony singing from Danby and Dave Burland recalls several 1960s and 70s British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, though the purely acoustic instrumentation on Penguin Eggs separates the album from those bands. The albums opens with Jones' arrangement of the English folk ballad \\"Canadee-I-O,\\" a recording cited as \\"iconic\\" by the BBC and the Guardian. It is followed by \\"The Drowned Lovers\\", an interpretation of the Child ballad \\"The Mother's Malison.\\" Jones later found the album version of \\"The Drowned Lovers\\" to be inferior to the harder-hitting version he began playing live in the few years after the album's release, which bears a different arrangement. The following two songs \\"The Humpback Whale\\" (originally \\"Ballina Whalers\\") and \\"The Little Pot Stove\\" (originally \\"Wee Pot Stove\\") are both compositions by the Scots-Australian whaler and singer Harry Robertson, although uncredited (\\"The Humpback Whale\\" is listed as \\"trad./arr. Jones\\") and were originally recorded by Robertson on his 1971 album Whale Chasing Men;Whale Chasing Men (album): information at www.harryrobertson.net they deal with aspects of whaling in the subtropics (off Byron Bay in Australia) and South Georgia in subantarctic waters, respectively, the latter song also providing the phrase used for the album title (\\"Salt fish and whale meat sausage, fresh penguin eggs a treat\\").Harry Robertson: \\"Wee Pot Stove\\" lyrics, at www.harryrobertson.net The Celtic song \\"Courting Is a Pleasure\\" concerns \\"a broken heart and emigration to America.\\" It features subtle counterpoint guitar lines that complement the lead vocals.Mike Raven. Nic Jones Guitar Style (\\"Living Tradition\\" – May/JUne 1997). The Guardian also cited his arrangement of \\"The Flandyke Shore\\" as iconic. The album's closing song, \\"Farewell to the Gold,\\" was written by New Zealand-born folk singer Paul Metsers, who moved to the United Kingdom to establish himself on the UK's folk club scene the same year Penguin Eggs was released.\\"Metsers, Paul\\": biographical entry in Larkin, C. ed.: The Guinness Who's Who of Folk Music. Guinness Publishing, 1993 Release and reception Penguin Eggs was released by Topic Records in June 1980, reaching number 71 on the UK Albums Chart. The album received critical acclaim, and Melody Maker named it their \\"Folk Album of the Year,\\" as did Folk Roots. Reissued by Topic Records on CD in 1991, Penguin Eggs has for many years been the only easily available Nic Jones studio album, and with the exception of several compilations released after Jones' retirement, Penguin Eggs remains the only Nic Jones CD available with endorsement from Jones' family. An audiophile, 200g heavyweight LP reissue of the album was issued by Three Black Feathers in 2009, while a 180g LP edition was released by Vinyl180 in 2017, with the first 500 copies being on white vinyl. Record Collector ranked the original LP edition of the album at number 41 on its list of the \\"top 50 most collectable records.\\" The Telegraph said that, while Jones' first three albums from 1970 and 1971 have not been reissued for many years, Penguin Eggs itself is a \\"neglected classic.\\" Mojo wrote in hindsight that there was strong clues on Penguin Eggs that Jones was \\"heading into bold territory.\\" By 1982, Jones was fully embraced in contemporary song and, strongly influenced by Bob Marley, even contemplated making folk-reggae fusions. However, Penguin Eggs was ultimately Jones' last studio album; on 28 February 1982, Jones' career was cut short when he was involved in a serious road traffic accident. Returning home by car after a gig at Glossop Folk Club, a tired Jones inadvertently drove into a lorry pulling out of Whittlesea brickworks. He suffered serious injuries, including many broken bones and brain damage, and required intensive care treatment and hospitalisation for a total of eight months. His injuries left him with permanent physical co-ordination problems, unable to play the guitar as well as before, and no longer able to play the fiddle at all.Mike Raven: Nic Jones (\\"Living Tradition – May/June 1997). He returned to the stage in 2010.Folk legend Nic Jones returns to the stage after 28 years (The Guardian, 5 August 2010). =Retrospective reviews= In a very positive retrospective review, Bruce Eder of AllMusic named Penguin Eggs an \\"Album Pick\\" and called it Jones' magnum opus. He wrote that the album \\"stands in a virtual class by itself -- a folk record built on playing of such virtuosity that anyone who enjoys guitar, of any type or style, should hear it; a body of traditional songs played with an immediacy and urgency that transcends any dry notions of scholarship; and a record that stands astride the opposing virtues of youth and antiquity, in its execution and source, respectively.\\" He felt the musicianship makes the album \\"truly special\\" and \\"alluring to modern listeners\\" and noted: \\"Penguin Eggs is one of those rare records were not just every song, but each instrumental part is worth hearing.\\" Journalist Jon Dennis of The Guardian wrote in retrospect: Penguin Eggs is listed as Jones' finest album in the Rough Guides book World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East, where it is referred to as a \\"seminal album from the English revival\\" which marks Jones' \\"sudden transformation from accomplished but more or less straightforward interpreter of folk song, to innovative arranger and intricate performer. It remains a classic.\\" In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music, writer Colin Larkin gave the album a perfect score and wrote that the album contains \\"some excellent performances,\\" including \\"The Humpback Whale.\\" Julie Henigan, in her book on DADGAD tunings, praised felt Jones used open tunings \\"inventively and with great flair,\\" and felt \\"his approach to setting traditional music is edifying.\\" The album is listed in the accompanying book to the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten as one of their classic recordsThree Score and Ten Accompanying Book with \\"The Humpback Whale\\" as the first track on the first CD in the set. Legacy Penguin Eggs has been cited as an influence by modern folk musicians, including Kate Rusby, who named it her favourite album ever. Colin Irwin of The Guardian called Penguin Eggs \\"groundbreaking,\\" writing that it took British folk music \\"to a new level, with Jones channelling his inner rock psyche into the unlikely format of a solo singer playing mostly traditional songs on an acoustic guitar.\\" The album has since repeatedly been cited as an influence by folk and pop singers, including English folk singers Eliza Carthy and Kate Rusby. Describing the album's enduring influence, Irwin noted that while British folk music was \\"largely barren\\" in the decades following Jones' accident, a new generation of folk musicians eventually emerged who \\"all appeared to carry a copy of the one Nic Jones album they could easily get their hands on, Penguin Eggs,\\" with singers such as Jon Boden, Jim Moray and Seth Lakeman citing Jones as an influence. Stuart Maconie reflected: \\"Before folk became hip with preening trendies, and indeed at the height of punk rock, the now wheelchair bound Jones [...] made this heartbreaking, plangent album of originals that sound ancient.\\" English folk musician Kate Rusby states that Penguin Eggs is her favourite album of all time. Comedian and writer Stewart Lee has ranked Penguin Eggs among his thirteen favourite albums of all time. Singer Peter Case called Penguin Eggs \\"one of the finest acoustic albums ever made.\\" Bob Dylan recorded \\"Canadee-I-O\\" for his album Good as I Been to You (1992), imitating Jones' arrangement of the song, though he did not give him credit in the album's liner notes. \\"The Flandyke Shore\\" has also been recorded by Joni Mitchell. In contrast to its glowing reputation, Jones looks back on Penguin Eggs with muted praise, saying in 2012: \\"It's all right, but people only go on about it because I wasn't around after that. I was interested in a more modern sound and I think I could have come up with a more interesting record after Penguin Eggs. Me having the smash-up made it more popular.\\" Penguin Eggs was named the 25th best ever folk album in the 1994 book The Guinness All Time Top 1000 Albums, which presented lists of the greatest albums by genre using over 200,000 votes cast by informed music lovers.All Time Top 1000 Albums, Guinness Publishing, 1994, ed. Colin Larkin In a 2001 poll conducted by Mike Harding of BBC Radio 2, Penguin Eggs was named the second best folk album of all time, after Fairport Convention's Liege & Lief (1969). In 2004, Observer Music Monthly ranked the album 79th in their critics' poll of the \\"Greatest British Albums.\\" Of those whose lists were featured, Stuart Maconie named it the 7th best British album. Journalist Peter Paphides named it the 7th best English folk album ever in 2005, saying it \\"has deservedly continued to feed Jones’ legend\\". He praised \\"Jones’s plangent delivery and exquisite harmonies.\\" The album is featured in the 2007 book The Mojo Collection, listing what its authors deems to be the 1,000 best albums ever, and in Uncut magazine's 2017 \\"Unlimited Record Guide,\\" listing the \\"greatest music of the last 60 years.\\" Track listing The detail after the title below is either the composer's name or references from the three major numbering schemes for traditional folk songs, the Roud Folk Song Index, Child Ballad Numbers and the Laws Numbers.

It was last assigned to the 311th Photographic Wing, stationed at Buckley Field, Colorado. It was disbanded on 5 October 1944, but reconstituted in 1985 as the 358th Special Operations Group. History Established in mid-1941 as a GHQ Air Force aerial mapping and reconnaissance group based at Bolling Field. Mission was to conduct long-range photo reconnaissance after the pattern developed by the British. Each of the four initial assigned squadrons of the group (1st, 2d, 3d, 4th) was assigned to one of the four continental air forces (1st, 2d, 3d, 4th). The unit had almost no opportunity for training because each of its squadrons was busily engaged in carrying out mapping missions for hemisphere defense. The Photographic Squadrons were largely equipped with short-range second-line aircraft from the 1930s. Not until the end of 1942 were the first modern aircraft, B-25 (F-10) Mitchells, were assigned to observation groups Long-range reconnaissance squadrons were established as part of combat bombardment groups in the Continental United States as well as the Caribbean and in Hawaii. These squadrons were associated with the 1st Photographic Group for crew training in aerial photography and reconnaissance. These bomber reconnaissance squadrons were designed to provide a long-range reconnaissance capability with each group. However, with the entry of the United States into World War II after the Pearl Harbor Attack, these units could no longer serve as both reconnaissance training and photo- mapping squadrons. The bombers were needed for combat bombing missions more than for reconnaissance. In April 1942 these squadrons were absorbed by those groups and were redesignated as bombardment squadrons. During World War II, the group charted and mapped areas of the United States and sent detachments to perform similar functions in Alaska, Canada, Africa, the Middle East, India, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and South America, and the Kurils.

He became, after his divorce from Lady Jean, the third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots. Lady Jean herself had a total of three husbands. Upon her second marriage, she became the Countess of Sutherland.  Family  Lady Jean Gordon was born at Huntly Castle, sometimes called Strathbogie, in Aberdeenshire, the second eldest daughter of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly, the wealthiest and most powerful landowner in the Scottish Highlands,Antonia Fraser, Mary, Queen of Scots, pp. 220–223. and Elizabeth Keith. Her paternal grandparents were Lord Gordon and Margaret Stewart, illegitimate daughter of King James IV by his mistress, Margaret Drummond. Her maternal grandparents were Robert Keith, Master of Marischal and Lady Elizabeth Douglas. Jean had nine brothers and two sisters, and the family were brought up at Huntly Castle, which was modernised during the 1550s.Sanderson, Margaret H. B., Mary Stewart's People, Edinburgh, (1987), 34, 36. Her father's Highlands estates were so numerous that they approached those of an independent monarch.Fraser, p.220 He became Lord Chancellor of Scotland in 1546, the year of her birth. However, the Earl was captured at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in September 1547, and spent some time in England. The Earl then followed a complicated political career balancing his and Scotland's international and religious interests. In the autumn of 1562, Mary, Queen of Scots came to the north to punish the family on the basis of allegations against Jean's brother, Sir John Gordon. At Darnaway Castle, Mary gave Huntly's title of Earl of Moray to her own illegitimate half-brother James, who was the husband of Jean's first cousin, Lady Agnes Keith. Jean's father slipped away from Huntly Castle, evading the queen's soldier William Kirkcaldy of Grange, but was defeated by James at the Battle of Corrichie in 1562. At the end of the fight, the Earl collapsed and died of apoplexy on the battlefield. Jean's father was posthumously tried for treason in Edinburgh, where his embalmed body was brought to face parliament, and his title and lands were thereby forfeited to the crown.Fraser, pp. 229–231 Jean's eldest surviving brother, Lord Gordon, was spared execution and eventually allowed to succeed the rebel Earl. However, Jean's brother, Sir John Gordon, was executed. As a token of the queen's clemency towards the Huntlys, Jean, her mother, and Lord Gordon were given positions at the royal court.Jean Gordon, Undiscovered Scotland Online, retrieved 30 March 2009 In 1565, Jean's brother, George, was allowed to succeed to his father's titles as the 5th Earl of Huntly, and his lands were restored in 1567.  Marriages and issue  James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell (1566 portrait) =Countess of Bothwell= On 24 February 1566, Jean, who was a Catholic, married James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, in a Protestant-rites ceremony apparently celebrated with considerable pomp. Queen Mary, who strongly approved of the match, supplied cloth of silver and white taffeta for Jean's wedding gown, although she had wanted the marriage to have taken place in the Chapel Royal during a mass. Bothwell, however refused to attend mass on Candlemas day.Fraser, pp.285, 302; (262 in (1969), citing CSP Scotland, vol. 2 (London, 1900), 355: Joseph Robertson, Inventaires (Edinburgh, 1863), p. 162, \\"12 aulnes de toylle d'argent plainne\\" for the robe, with \\"6 aulnes de taffeta blan\\" for sleeves & train. Her uncle, Alexander Gordon, Bishop of Galloway, preached at the ceremony at the court at Holyroodhouse.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 2 (London, 1900), p. 258. Jean was pale-skinned, and had a firm nose, bulbous eyes, and a long clever face which lacked beauty and softness.Fraser, p.285 According to author Antonia Fraser, she had a \\"cool, detached character warmed by a masculine intelligence, and a great understanding above the capacity of her sex.\\"Fraser, p. 285 She was provided with a large dowry by her brother George, and she had an excellent appreciation of the value of her properties. Later she managed to retain her lands, despite the Earl of Bothwell's attainder. At the end of February 1567, Jean became gravely ill and was in peril of dying. In point of fact, one ambassador announced her death.Fraser, p.360 That same year, after much persuasion from her brother, who was Bothwell's ally, Jean agreed to begin divorce proceedings against her husband. On 3 May 1567, she was given judgement against Bothwell in the Protestant commissary court on the grounds of his alleged adultery with her maid and seamstress, Bessie Crawford.Fraser, p.370 Bessie was described by Jean's witness as a bonny little woman, 20 years old, black-haired and pale, often wearing a black gown. She had been a servant of Jean's mother and her father was a blacksmith. The adultery occurred at Haddington Abbey and Crichton Castle.Stevenson, Joseph ed., History of Mary Stewart by Claud Nau, Edinburgh (1883), clxiii. The marriage was formally annulled on 7 May by the Consistorial Court of St. Andrews presided over by the Catholic Archbishop Hamilton. The annulment was due to Bothwell and Jean not having received a dispensation for their marriage, although they were within the fourth degree of consanguinity. Actually a dispensation had been given prior to their marriage by Archbishop Hamilton himself.Fraser, p. 370 Eight days later, on 15 May Bothwell married, as her third husband, the widowed Mary, Queen of Scots, whose late husband Lord Darnley had been murdered at Kirk o'Field, Edinburgh in mysterious circumstances which implicated Bothwell as having been the chief culprit behind the crime.Fraser, pp.330–352 Jean remained at Bothwell's Crichton Castle, its mortgage having been redeemed by her own dowry.Fraser, p. 374 Following Bothwell and Queen Mary's defeat at Carberry Hill, Jean abandoned Crichton, and returned to her mother at Strathbogie Castle. In December, Bothwell's titles and estates, including Crichton Castle, were forfeited by an Act of Parliament for treason. =Countess of Sutherland= Jean married secondly at Huntly Castle, on 13 December 1573, Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, thus becoming the Countess of Sutherland. Alexander was previously married to Barbara Sinclair, daughter of his guardian, George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness; but this relationship had been sour, and ended in divorce when the young Earl of Sutherland came of age, apparently without children.Sinclair, Thomas. Caithness events. W. Rae, 1899. Jean and Alexander together had seven (or possibly eight) children:Margaret H. B. Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), pp. 45–46. * Jane Gordon (born 1 November 1574), in December 1589 married 14th Chief of Clan MacKay, Huistean Du MacKay of Strathnaver in Sutherland (1562-1614) * John Gordon, 13th Earl of Sutherland (20 July 1575 – 11 September 1615), on 5 February 1600 married Agnes Elphinstone, by whom he had five children, including John Gordon, 14th Earl of Sutherland. * Alexander Gordon, elder, died in infancy. * Adam Gordon, died in infancy. * Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun, 1st Baronet (14 May 1580 – March 1654), on 16 February 1613 married Louisa Gordon, by whom he had issue. * Mary Gordon (14 August 1582 – 1605), on 21 February 1598 married David Ross of Balnowgowan * Sir Alexander Gordon of Navisdale (born 5 March 1585) * Possibly another daughter whose name is unknown. She was the first wife of an Alexander Gordon of Aikenhead, believed to be of the Lesmoir family, who later became known as Alexander Gordon of Salterhill. Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun mentioned above had first purchased Salterhill from the Innes family in 1636.Shaw, Lachlan, The history of the province of Moray Oxford, UK: J. Grant, 1827. As it is assumed Alexander Gordon of Salterhill acquired that estate through his first wife, she would appear to have been a sister or otherwise near relative of Sir Robert Gordon. This couple is named as the progenitor of many Irish Gordon families such as Ballinteggart and Sheepbridge, as well as their American descendants.McBride, Nancy S. Gordon kinship. McClure Print. Co., 1973. Within two years of Jean's second marriage, due to the Earl's increasing ill health, Jean ran the vast Sutherland estates from their base at Dunrobin Castle.Margaret H. B. Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), 43: Jean Gordon, Undiscovered Scotland Online, retrieved 30 March 2008 The Earl died on 6 December 1594. In 1630 the garden at Dunrobin was described as \\"planted with all kynd of fruits, hearbs and flowres used in this kingdome, and good store of sfaron, tobacco and rosemarie\\".Margaret H. B. Sanderson, Mary Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 50. =Third marriage= Five years later, on 10 December 1599, Jean married her third and last husband, Alexander Ogilvy of Boyne, the widower of Mary Beaton, one of Queen Mary's celebrated quartet of ladies-in-waiting who had died in 1598.HMC 6th Report: W. G. C. Cumming (London, 1877), p. 683. He was the only man Jean had ever truly loved, as her two previous marriages had been made for political reasons. Lady Jean Gordon died on 14 May 1629 at Dunrobin Castle at the age of eighty-three. She was buried in Dornoch. Robert Gordon of Gordonstoun wrote her into the history of the House of Gordon; > \\"a vertuous and comelie lady, judicious, of excellent memorie, and great > understanding above the capacitie of her sex; in this much to be commended > that ... schoe alwise managed her effaris with so great prudence and > foresight that the enemeis of the familie could never prevail against her, > ...

B., Mary > Stewart's People (Edinburgh, 1987), p. 53 quoting Fraser, William, > Sutherland Book, vol. 1, 168.  In art, fiction, and film  In 1566, the Earl of Bothwell commissioned an artist, whose name is not recorded, to paint miniature portraits of Jean and himself. These were done in oil on copper. Jean appears as a character in Elizabeth Byrd's historical romance, Immortal Queen, which is a fictionalised story of the life of Mary, Queen of Scots. Irish actress Maria Aitken played the part of Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell in Mary, Queen of Scots, the 1971 film which starred Vanessa Redgrave in the title role.

Biography Curtis was born on 15 June 1905 in London, the only child of Herbert John Curtis and Elizabeth Winifred Curtis (née Baker). Curtis lived in India for several years as a child after her father was posted there. She was a gifted student, and studied science at University College, London from 1924, winning various awards and scholarships. She graduated in 1927 and completed an honours degree in Botany the following year for research on Spartinia townsendii, and Taraxacum (dandelions). This was followed by several years of travel through Europe and teaching in Manchester and Hampstead. In 1939 she emigrated to Australia with her family on the TSS Ascania where she initially took a teaching position as Science Mistress at the private girls' school Fahan School in Hobart. She later joined the Department of Biology at the University of Tasmania and took part in the creation of the Department of Botany there in 1945. In 1943 she started work on The Students' Flora of Tasmania, a well known work on Tasmanian flora. The first volume was published in 1956; the fifth and final volume was published in 1994, more than 50 years after its commencement. From the early 1960s, much of this was a close scientific collaboration with botanist and plant collector Dennis Ivor Morris (1924–2005) with whom she also shared a close friendship. In 1944 Curtis published Variations in Pultenaea juniperina, the first record of polyploidy in an Australian native plant. This led to her PhD from London University which was awarded in 1950. Her doctoral thesis was titled Studies in Experimental Taxonomy and Variation in Certain Tasmanian Plants which was a pioneering work in cytology and polyploidy. Following from her doctoral award in London she travelled to the United States visiting various herbaria. She was appointed University of Tasmania Senior Lecturer in Botany in 1951 and Reader in Botany in 1956, the most senior position held by a woman at the university at that time. Curtis also acted as Head of the Department on several occasions. She submitted her published works to the University of London for a Doctor of Science degree in 1967 which was conferred in 1968. From 1967 to 1978 she wrote the six-volume The Endemic Flora of Tasmania, with illustrations by Margaret Stones, a commission sponsored by Lord Talbot de Malahide. Her mother died in 1962 and she nursed her father at home until his death in 1967. Dr. Curtis retired from the Department of Botany in 1966 and was appointed Honorary Research Fellow; she was made an Honorary Research Associate in the Department of Plant Science in 1998. She died on 14 October 2005 in Hobart.  Awards and recognition  As well as her academic achievements, other awards include: * Royal Society of Tasmanian Clive Lord Memorial Medal (1966) * Australian Natural History Medallion (1976) * Membership of the Order of Australia (1977) * Honorary DSc from the University of Tasmania (1987) * Australian Plants Award (1988) * ANZAAS Meuller Medal (1994) * Hobart Citizen of the Year (1997) A number of Tasmanian vascular plants have been named in her honour, including Richea curtisiae – A.M. Gray; Epilobium curtisiae – Raven; Viola hederacea subsp. curtisiae – L. Adams; Epacris curtisiae – Jarman; Winifredia sola – L.A.S.Johnston & B.Briggs. The 'Winifred Curtis Scamander Reserve', a 75 hectare private nature reserve located 2 km south of Scamander on Tasmania's North-East coast is named in her honour. A teaching laboratory at the University of Tasmania's School of Plant Science is named the 'Curtis Laboratory', and the 'Winifred Curtis Prize' has been awarded annually to the student who demonstrated the greatest proficiency in first year Plant Science courses since 1990.

FDLTCC is located within the Twin Ports area of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin in northeastern Minnesota. The College is a member of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium. FDLTCC was Minnesota's first tribal college. FDLTCC is the only college in the nation both established as a tribal college under federal law and operating as part of a state-funded higher education system. History The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians recognized that post-secondary education was crucial to the tribe's comprehensive education planning in 1979. Beginning in 1985, Mesabi Community College began holding classes at the Tribal Ojibwe School on the Fond du Lac Indian Reservation. The Fond du Lac Reservation Business Committee provided the leadership necessary to unify tribal, state, and community support for a community college that would serve both the Fond du Lac Band and surrounding community areas. Following a feasibility study of higher education needs of the American Indian and non-Indian people in Carlton County area, recommendation was made for a joint venture between the Fond du Lac tribal government and the Arrowhead Community College Region (ACCR). In 1987, the Fond du Lac Higher Education Center Task Force was formed. The task force's efforts resulted in the creation of the Fond du Lac Community College Center, a Mesabi Range Community College extension located in the Cloquet, Minnesota Garfield Community Center building. In 1989, the State of Minnesota appropriated $6,990,000 for the founding of FDLTCC. A new community college site was built and opened to students in 1992. The College's first president Jack Briggs envisioned a college founded to support tribal cultures, tribal values, and tribal spirituality but also committed to equally serve and welcome non-tribal students. In 1995, the Minnesota Community College Board fully funded FDLTCC and the institution became independent from ACCR. In 1996, the State of Minnesota reorganized its higher education institutions and FDLTCC became a member of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. In May 1999, after an intensive self-study process and site visit evaluation the College received its first ten-year accreditation as a stand-alone college by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2012, FDLTCC celebrated its 25th anniversary. Celebrations included a special premiere of Extraordinary: Celebrating 25 Years, a video commemorating the College's history through the voices of those who were among the original “dreamers” and those who were among the College's graduates. The 22-minute movie won silver in the Special Video Production category at the national 2013 Collegiate Advertising Awards. Mission Statement To provide higher education opportunities for its communities in a welcoming, culturally diverse environment. AccreditationHigher Learning Commission= FDLTCC was accredited as part of ACCR and Mesabi Range Technical College until 1997. In 1995, FDLTCC was granted candidacy for accreditation as a separate entity. Since 1997, FDLTCC has been accredited by the [Higher Learning Commission]. =World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium= In 2017, FDLTCC became a fully accredited member of the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC). WINHEC was established in August 2002 at the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Education in Alberta, Canada. WINHEC accreditation performs a number of important functions including the validation of credibility on the part of the public being served and encouragement of efforts toward maximum educational effectiveness. The accrediting process requires schools as well as other educational institutions and programs to examine their own goals, operations, and achievements in light of being committed to building partnerships that restore and retain indigenous spirituality, cultures and languages, homelands, social systems, economic systems and self-determination. Academics Degrees are offered in the following fields: *Liberal Arts and Sciences, Anishinaabe *Fine Arts *Environmental Science *Electric Utility Technician, Clean Energy Systems Technician *Law Enforcement, Criminal Justice, and Corrections *Human Services, Early Childhood Development, and Chemical Dependency *Elementary Education *Geospatial Technology (GIS) *Nursing (Registered, Licensed Practical, and Nursing Assistant) *Business (Business/Financial Services, Small Business Entrepreneurship) *Health Careers Athletics FDLTCC is a member of the Minnesota College Athletic Conference (MCAC). The College fields teams in Football, Basketball, and Volleyball. Student Body FDLTCC's dual state and tribal institutional model is different from all other colleges in the nation. FDLTCC is committed to providing higher education opportunities for its communities in a welcoming, culturally diverse environment. Approximately 40% of the College's undergraduate student population consists of students of color. FDLTCC's student body has a higher percentage of students of color than any college or university in northeastern Minnesota and is a leader outside of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area. Sustainability FDLTCC's Environmental Institute offers unique research, facilities, and learning opportunities in natural resources and the environmental studies.

In academic year 2017-2018, FDLTCC produced more American Indian graduates than any other college or university in Minnesota. FDLTCC has achieved a nearly one-to-one 3-year completion rate for students of color and white students. According to the latest available fall 2014 cohort, FDLTCC students of color completed at 94% the rate of white students. FDLTCC students achieved a completion rate 19% higher than the Minnesota State system colleges’ average. FDLTCC's 3-year completion rates have exceed the system colleges’ average in each of the last three available cohort cycles (Fall 2012-2014). FDLTCC part- time student success exceeded the Minnesota State system colleges’ average 3-year graduation rate in each of the last five 4th fall cohort cycles (Fall 2010-2014). In 1994, Congress passed legislation designating FDLTCC as a Land Grant institution.

Water motion The water from a river can enter the receiving body in a variety of different ways. The motion of a river is influenced by the relative density of the river compared to the receiving water, the rotation of the earth, and any ambient motion in the receiving water, such as tides or seiches. If the river water has a higher density than the surface of the receiving water, the river water will plunge below the surface. The river water will then either form an underflow or an interflow within the lake. However, if the river water is lighter than the receiving water, as is typically the case when fresh river water flows into the sea, the river water will float along the surface of the receiving water as an overflow. Alongside these advective transports, inflowing water will also diffuse. Landforms At the but of a river, the change in flow condition can cause the river to drop any sediment it is carrying. This sediment deposition can generate a variety of landforms, such as deltas, sand bars, spits, and tie channels.

North was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of a coal merchant and a churchwarden. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a mechanic. He moved to Chile where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in Huasco. He later moved to the Peruvian town of Iquique where he worked as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner. The War of the Pacific (1879-1883) provided North with an opportunity to purchase large numbers of bonds in the Peruvian nitrate industry. When Chile annexed Iquique and the surrounding province of Tarapacá the Chilean government transferred ownership of the nitrate fields to the bondholders. North was thus able to take a monopoly share of the lucrative Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment, becoming known as \\"The Nitrate King\\". North built upon his nitrates business by expanding into further monopolies in waterworks and freight railways, but also owned several iron and coal fields. North maintained his monopolies by employing lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the Chilean National Congress. This was allowed by Chilean president Domingo Santa María, but Santa María's successor, José Manuel Balmaceda, became concerned that Tarapacá was starting to resemble a \\"state within a state\\" and resolved to break North's monopoly. Balmaceda had to force competition reforms through against opposition in congress, amongst a series of disputes which would eventually escalate into the 1891 Chilean Civil War between the president and the congress. North also had investments in the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company which operated a concession in the Congo Free State. This company was involved in the extraction and export of rubber from the state, another highly profitable business, but later became involved in abuses of human rights against those under its power. However North's finances were eventually depleted and when he died his business empire had collapsed. Early life North was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, on 30 January 1842, the son of a coal merchant and a churchwarden. At the age of fifteen he was apprenticed to millwrights and engineers before working for several years as a mechanic. He moved to Chile in South America at the age of 23 where his first occupation was as a boiler riveter in Huasco. He moved from Huasco to Iquique in the province of Tarapacá, which was then part of Peru. Here North established what later became a large business empire, working as a waterworks operator, importer and ship owner.. War of the Pacific General Baquedano, commander in chief of the Chilean Army in the War of the Pacific Territorial disputes between Chile, Peru and Bolivia triggered the War of the Pacific in 1879 with Chile invading and occupying Peruvian and Bolivian land. In the course of the war, North suffered damage to his waterworks, and one of his ships was sunk. However he also befriended the Chilean Admiral Patricio Lynch who later supported him in his business ventures. During the war, North was assisted by two British men: Robert Harvey, who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates (saltpetre) industry, and John Dawson, a banker. North was able to use Harvey's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru's poor military performance during the war.. After the war, the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields, perhaps influenced by appeals from North's friends. North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds.. The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that it would have cost them GBP£4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators. By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates.. An 1889 caricature of \\"The Nitrate King\\" North left Chile and returned to the United Kingdom in order to raise credit to provide for machinery, transport and employment costs. It was there, in February 1883—still eight months before Peru officially ceded the nitrate fields to Chile—that he established the Liverpool Nitrate Company. North dispatched Robert Harvey to Chile with equipment and engineers to begin construction of the mines whilst North remained in Britain to manage the financial side of the enterprise. The mines were operation by 1884 and producing 3,000 short tons of nitrates per month. The company turned large profits and was able to pay dividends in excess of 20% each year until 1886 when it was liquidated by North and his partners in order to found other companies. As a result of his fantastic profits North became known as \\"The King Of Nitrates\\" and was a well known public figure in England. Nitrates were an important source of income for the Chilean government and an increase in export duty from CLP 4 pesos per ton in 1878 to CLP 22 in 1882 resulted in revenue from nitrates increasing from CLP 6 to 25 million.. This allowed the government to make cuts in both income and land tax. The reliance of Chile upon its nitrate income caused conflict between the government and the nitrate production cartel. The cartel wanted to maximise the price of nitrates by cutting production whilst the government wanted to maximise their duty income by maximising exports. The nature of the trade meant that the Chilean economy was also totally dependent on imports and exports to and from Britain.. The periodic downturns in nitrate revenue caused by the cartel cutting production eventually forced the Chilean government to print more money, causing inflation to increase and the peso to devalue. North's monopolies In the meantime North continued to invest in Chile and founded the Nitrate Railway Company which held a monopoly on nitrate rail transport in Tarapacá and also held a monopoly on the water supply in Iquique. He also owned several coal and iron fields along the Biobío River and a gasworks at Iquique. In Britain he set up North's Navigation Collieries (1889) Ltd. in Glamorgan, south Wales, a venture which turned out to be one of his most successful. By 1920 his Welsh company employed over 6,000 miners and produced over one million tons of coal per year. The development of North's Navigation Collieries Ltd. was largely responsible for the rapid growth of Maesteg and the Llynfi Valley during the years 1890 to 1910. In addition, his nitrate business was the primary cause of the development of the towns of Iquique and Pisagua. To maintain his monopolies, North employed lawyers to block competing entrepreneurs both in court and the Chilean National Congress. Under president Domingo Santa María, North's monopolies went unchallenged, and Santa María's successor in 1886, José Manuel Balmaceda, initially allowed the situation to continue. However, Balmaceda became concerned that the situation in Tarapacá was starting to resemble a \\"state within a state\\" and decided to break North's monopoly. Congress was not supportive and Balmaceda had to force through reforms to restore competition in the province. Increasing disputes between Balmaceda and Congress resulted in the outbreak of the Civil War in 1891. In the meantime North enjoyed the status of a famous high society gentleman in Britain and was worth US$10 million in 1889. He was a friend of the Prince of Wales, later to become Edward VII, and was described, by The New York Times as a \\"lion\\" of the London social season. He was the owner of a estate with extensive stables and a mansion, Avery Hill, near to Eltham in Kent, which was subsequently acquired by the LCC and opened as a ladies teacher-training college in 1906. North owned several racing horses and won several British racing trophies. North visited the United States in July 1889 where he was described as a member of the nouveau riche and a \\"Chilean Monte Cristo\\" because of his recent rise to fame and fortune. He became known as Colonel North as he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Tower Hamlets Regiment of Volunteer Engineers on 25 March 1885. He regularly allowed the regiment of 250 men to camp in the gardens of his estate for three days at a time. During this time he would hold festivals for the men and the local villagers and at one of these events he challenged the Lieutenant-Colonel to a footrace and won. Financial decline Congo Free State concession companies, ABIR shown in dark red North was approached by King Leopold II of Belgium at a horse racing event to provide funds to establish a concession company to extract rubber from the Congo Free State.. North agreed and provided GBP£40,000 of the BEF250,000 initial investment to set up the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber Company (ABIR) at Antwerp on 6 August 1892... ABIR had exclusive rights to all forest products from the Maringa-Lopori basin for 30 years and had police powers within the limits of the concession to enforce the collection of rubber as a tax. The company was initially very successful but by 1898, two years after North's death, his heirs had sold his shares in the company.. The company later became infamous for human rights abuses of the inhabitants of its concession and fell into financial troubles.. Despite his varied investments across the world North's finances eventually dwindled, his decline was accelerated by the Chilean Civil War. By the time he died on 5 May 1896 his business empire had collapsed. His death occurred within half an hour of eating some oysters and the shells were sent for analysis but it was suspected that heart problems were the cause of death. He donated Kirkstall Abbey to the city of Leeds, a plaque in the Gift Shop of the Abbey is inscribed \\"The Abbey and part of the adjoining lands were acquired from the representatives of the Earl of Cardigan by Colonel J.T North a native of Leeds and presented by him to the Corporation of Leeds in the year 1889 to be held in trust for his fellow citizens as a place of public resort and recreation for ever works of preservation were completed by the Corporation in the year 1895\\". North also made donations to Leeds Infirmary and the Yorkshire College of Science, which later became the University of Leeds. ReferencesBibliography *. *.  *. *.

The terminology is typically applied to coordination and organometallic complexes, but resembles the Sn2 mechanism in organic chemistry. The opposite pathway is dissociative substitution, being analogous to the Sn1 pathway. Intermediate pathways exist between the pure associative and pure dissociative pathways, these are called interchange mechanisms. Associative pathways are characterized by binding of the attacking nucleophile to give a discrete, detectable intermediate followed by loss of another ligand. Complexes that undergo associative substitution are either coordinatively unsaturated or contain a ligand that can change its bonding to the metal, e.g. change in hapticity or bending of a nitrogen oxide ligand (NO). In homogeneous catalysis, the associative pathway is desirable because the binding event, and hence the selectivity of the reaction, depends not only on the nature of the metal catalyst but also on the substrate. Examples of associative mechanisms are commonly found in the chemistry of 16e square planar metal complexes, e.g. Vaska's complex and tetrachloroplatinate. These compounds (MX4) bind the incoming (substituting) ligand Y to form pentacoordinate intermediates MX4Y that in a subsequent step dissociates one of their ligands. Dissociation of Y results in no detectable net reaction, but dissociation of X results in net substitution, giving the 16e complex MX3Y. The first step is typically rate determining. Thus, the entropy of activation is negative, which indicates an increase in order in the system. These reactions follow second order kinetics: the rate of the appearance of product depends on the concentration of MX4 and Y. The rate law is governed by the Eigen–Wilkins Mechanism. center Associative interchange pathway In many substitution reactions, well-defined intermediates are not observed, when the rate of such processes are influenced by the nature of the entering ligand, the pathway is called associative interchange, abbreviated Ia. Representative is the interchange of bulk and coordinated water in [V(H2O)6]2+. In contrast, the slightly more compact ion [Ni(H2O)6]2+ exchanges water via the Id. Effects of ion pairing Polycationic complexes tend to form ion pairs with anions and these ion pairs often undergo reactions via the Ia pathway. The electrostatically held nucleophile can exchange positions with a ligand in the first coordination sphere, resulting in net substitution. An illustrative process comes from the \\"anation\\" (reaction with an anion) of chromium(III) hexaaquo complex: ::[Cr(H2O)6]3+ \\\\+ SCN− {[Cr(H2O)6], NCS}2+ ::{[Cr(H2O)6], NCS}2+ [Cr(H2O)5NCS]2+ \\\\+ H2O Special ligand effects In special situations, some ligands participate in substitution reactions leading to associative pathways. These ligands can adopt multiple motifs for binding to the metal, each of which involves a different number of electrons \\"donated.\\" A classic case is the indenyl effect in which an indenyl ligand reversibly \\"slips' from pentahapto (η5) coordination to trihapto (η3). Other pi-ligands behave in this way, e.g. allyl (η3 to η1) and naphthalene (η6 to η4). Nitric oxide typically binds to metals to make a linear MNO arrangement, wherein the nitrogen oxide is said to donate 3e− to the metal. In the course of substitution reactions, the MNO unit can bend, converting the 3e− linear NO ligand to a 1e− bent NO ligand. SN1cB mechanism The rate for the hydrolysis of cobalt(III) ammine halide complexes are deceptive, appearing to be associative but proceeding by an alternative pathway. The hydrolysis of [Co(NH3)5Cl]2+ follows second order kinetics: the rate increases linearly with concentration of hydroxide as well as the starting complex. Based on this information, the reactions would appear to proceed via nucleophilic attack of hydroxide at cobalt. Studies show, however, that the hydroxide deprotonates one NH3 ligand to give the conjugate base of the starting complex, i.e., [Co(NH3)4(NH2)Cl]+. In this monocation, the chloride spontaneously dissociates. This pathway is called the SN1cB mechanism. Eigen-Wilkins mechanism The Eigen-Wilkins mechanism, named after chemists Manfred Eigen and R. G. Wilkins,M. Eigen, R. G. Wilkins: Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions. In: Advances in Chemistry Series. Nr. 49, 1965, S. 55. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C. is a mechanism and rate law in coordination chemistry governing associative substitution reactions of octahedral complexes. It was discovered for substitution by ammonia of a chromium-(III) hexaaqua complex.Basolo, F.; Pearson, R. G. \\"Mechanisms of Inorganic Reactions.\\" John Wiley and Son: New York: 1967. R. G. Wilkins \\"Kinetics and Mechanism of Reactions of Transition Metal Complexes,\\" 2nd Edition, VCH, Weinheim, 1991. The key feature of the mechanism is an initial rate- determining pre-equilibrium to form an encounter complex ML6-Y from reactant ML6 and incoming ligand Y. This equilibrium is represented by the constant KE: :ML6 \\\\+ Y ML6-Y The subsequent dissociation to form product is governed by a rate constant k: :ML6-Y → ML5Y + L A simple derivation of the Eigen-Wilkins rate law follows:G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr “Inorganic Chemistry” 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, . :[ML6-Y] = KE[ML6][Y] :[ML6-Y] = [M]tot \\\\- [ML6] :rate = k[ML6-Y] :rate = kKE[Y][ML6] Leading to the final form of the rate law, using the steady-state approximation (d[ML6-Y] / dt = 0), :rate = kKE[Y][M]tot / (1 + KE[Y]) =Eigen-Fuoss equation= A further insight into the pre-equilibrium step and its equilibrium constant KE comes from the Fuoss- Eigen equation proposed independently by Eigen and R. M. Fuoss: :KE = (4πa3/3000) x NAexp(-V/RT) Where a represents the minimum distance of approach between complex and ligand in solution (in cm), NA is the Avogadro constant, R is the gas constant and T is the reaction temperature. V is the electrostatic potential energy of the ions at that distance: :V = z1z2e2/4πaε Where z is the charge number of each species and ε is the vacuum permittivity. A typical value for KE is 0.0202 dm3mol−1 for neutral particles at a distance of 200 pm.Atkins, P. W. (2006). Shriver & Atkins inorganic chemistry. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press The result of the rate law is that at high concentrations of Y, the rate approximates k[M]tot while at low concentrations the result is kKE[M]tot[Y]. The Eigen-Fuoss equation shows that higher values of KE (and thus a faster pre-equilibrium) are obtained for large, oppositely- charged ions in solution.

Elena Street, Binondo, Manila near 168 Shopping Mall, the Cityplace Square, and Lucky Chinatown Mall. It was established on April 15, 1899 in response to the growing need of education in the post- Spanish era Chinese community. The school turned the first page of formal Chinese education in the Philippines, earning the recognition of being the country's pioneer and oldest Chinese school. History Tiong Se Academy was established as the \\"Anglo Chinese School\\" on April 15, 1899 by Engracio Palanca (Tankang), the first Chinese consul to the Philippines. Tankang solicited funds from the Chinese community in the Philippines for the school's foundation. It first held classes at the backyard of the Imperial Chinese Consulate General. The school moved to San Fernando Street in 1899; to Salazar Street in 1909, to then Sacristia Street now Ongpin Street in 1910, and to Santa Elena Street in 1912. The school was closed in 1942 following the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II and was opened again in 1945. Due to the Filipinization of foreign schools in the country in the 1970s, the school's name was changed to \\"Tiong Se Academy\\" on February 24, 1975. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines credited the school as a model for educational institutions for Chinese and Filipino- Chinese people. CurriculaEnglish curriculum= K-12 Basic Education System Since school year 2012–2013, the school complies with the K-12 Basic Education Curriculum implemented by the Department of Education and is now effective for all levels in Kindergarten, Elementary, High School departments. The school will now offer complete senior high school levels for Academic Track (General Academics Strand and Accountancy, Business and Management Strand). =Chinese curriculum= The school's Chinese curriculum is proposed to follow the 12-year basic education system. Subjects to be taught for senior high school levels were under study and were expected to be offered in June 2016 with the Grade 11 English classes. TSA uses the simplified Chinese characters for teaching Chinese since the first semester of school year 2007–2008 for elementary and high school levels and since June 2012 for pre- school. In elementary and high school levels, TSA maintains a three-period- per-day (fifteen periods a week) policy as mandated by the Filipinization law of the late President Marcos, which is in effect to date. In June 2012, the school added a new Chinese Culture (文化) subject to educate today's generation of Filipino-Chinese of the culture of their ancestors.

As he grew up, Mehdi Ali started working as a writer at the All India Radio, Delhi. Here he got acquainted with Saadat Hasan Manto. Manto, who was active in the Hindi film industry, requested Ashok Kumar to give Mehdi Ali some work. He soon got a film called Aath Din (1946) in which he not only wrote dialogues but also acted. Sashadhar Mukherjee, one of the partners in Filmistan Studio, gave Mehdi Ali a chance to write lyrics for his film, Do Bhai (1947). Songs from the film such as \\"Mera Sunder Sapna\\" and \\"Yaad Karoge\\" became instant hits. In 1947, Mehdi and his wife Tahira decided to stay in India instead of migrating to Pakistan.

History The series came about as the result of talks among CAMSO, Spedeworth International Ltd. and SCSA V8 Trophy. The thoughts were around the fact there are so many late model type stock cars in Europe which are not racing, and it seemed silly not to do something about it. For 2009 racing driver Tony Roots took over the CAMSO organisation with other drivers Colin White and John Stuard. The organisers put together a calendar which featured the Warneton ten times and Lydden Hill and Hednesford once. Eighteen drivers joined the series for the first races. A summary of the weekend was broadcast on Motors TV UK. Each raceday featured 2 25 lap heat races and a 35 lap final. The first ever race of the series was won by Gary Ellis in a Chevrolet. In 2010 the series expanded to include Ipswich in its schedule and in 2011 Venray was added to the series. Because of disagreements between promoters at Venray and Warneton, the series split in 2013. The CAMSO V8 name was revived for the championship held at Warneton, which also includes visits to Lydden Hill, while the championship held at Venray was named the LMV8 Supercup. For 2017 the Series will be revived with races at Warneton and Lelystad. Cars European Late Model Series is open to North American Stock Cars with a wheelbase of 104-105 inches.

Formed in 1890 as Victoria College of Music and incorporated in 1891, the College is now solely an examining body and no longer operates a full-time teaching institution, though in its early years offered many of the services of a full conservatoire. Throughout the early and mid-twentieth century the College offered correspondence courses in theory and written subjects, maintained a network of teachers with whom tuition could be arranged both in London and local centres, and arranged summer schools and other residential courses in various disciplines. However following the Second World War the College has focused upon its work in the examining field and developing syllabuses as required. From its founding the college has had a mission based upon the development of the candidate. As a result, the college examines in a range of subjects, including many not offered by other boards such as contrabassoon, mandolin and ukulele, as well as a range of speech and drama subjects. In particular the college has a policy of introducing new subjects where requested to meet the needs of teachers and to match new innovations in educational policy. Examples include the new options for large ensembles and group examination within ocarina playing to take into account the current UK government policy on whole class instrumental and vocal teaching. Subjects As a result of its broad remit, Victoria College of Music and Drama offers a range of subjects including all traditional musical disciplines, as well as more unusual ones including contrabassoon, ukulele, self-accompanied singing and mandolin. The board was a pioneer in the examination of electronic organ and still maintains a full syllabus for this instrument, as well as being the first board to offer examinations in electronic keyboard to diploma level. However the activities of the college are not confined to the sphere of music and it is very active in the field of speech and drama, offering a range of examinations in subjects as diverse as Business Speaking, Acting, Speech, Bible Reading and Drama Production. Many of these fields are available in the full range of examinations, diplomas and medals. Examinations and Diplomas The College has a full range of examinations, with special emphasis on encouraging young beginners. This has resulted in the four introductory grades available for most subjects at First Steps, Preliminary, Preparatory and Advanced Preparatory. These examinations are aimed at players within the first twelve months of playing an instrument. Following on from these introductory grades are the standard grades 1 to 8, available in music subjects and speech and drama. Parallel to the graded examinations is a series of medals that take the form of recitals with theory questions drawing from the same repertoire but without scales, arpeggios or musicianship tests It is also available as an additional qualification for those who take the graded exams. Medals have been awarded from the earliest years of the College's existence. The medal examinations are: *Junior Bronze Medal *Junior Silver Medal *Bronze Medal *Silver Medal *Gold Medal *Platinum Medal In some cases, the College's requirements differ from those of other exam boards. At least grade IV theory of music is required for grade 8 in any practical examination. There is a grade V minimum requirement for the diploma (see below), and for an Associate diploma, grade VI for Licentiate diploma but no theory requirement for a Fellowship diploma, as entrants already hold Licenitate or have been granted direct entry by virtue of other prior learning. For some grades and diplomas, other means of showing the required theory can be used. For example for grade 8 a GCSE C grade or equivalent (e.g. a BTEC Level 2 pass, merit or distinction). For a candidate who has not taken the theory or produced the equivalent, the College will hold the certificate and award until produced or exemption is granted. =Diplomas= The College has a full system of diploma examinations, available in most fields. Until 2012 a Pre-Diploma Certificate existed and wadm the followed by the first full diploma, the Diploma of Victoria College of Music and Drama (DipVCM), which carries with it the right to post-nominal letters and reduced academic dress. The certificate was withdrawn from all subjects to come into line with other awarding bodies at the higher levels. There then follows the three standard diplomas of Associate (AVCM), Licentiate (LVCM) and Fellow (FVCM) which all carry post-nominal letters and academic dress. These are available in all fields as performers' or teachers' diplomas, as well as by composition, conducting, research or theory. There also exists the award of Certificated Teacher (CT,VCM) which is an award based upon teaching ability and the Honorary Life Membership (HonVCM) for those who have given many years service to the College as a teacher, local secretary, examiner, etc. Both these carry post-nominal letters. FVCM is also awarded as an honorary award from time to time for distinguished service to the College. Some diplomas also carry the suffix 'Ed' for in Education (e.g. AVCMEd). However teaching and education diplomas do not confer UK Qualified Teacher Status, rather they show that the examiner would recommend them to a prospective student. The College of Violinists was founded in 1890 and became an administrative division of Victoria College of Music in 1962. In addition the diplomas noted above, the diplomas of Associate of the College of Violinists (ACV) and Licentiate of the College of Violinists (LCV) remain available through Victoria College Examinations as performance diplomas for string players, while Fellow of the College of Violinists (FCV) is awarded purely for services to the arts.

The Samoa hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located in the south Pacific Ocean. The hotspot model describes a hot upwelling plume of magma through the Earth's crust as an explanation of how volcanic islands are formed. The hotspot idea came from J. Tuzo Wilson in 1963 based on the Hawaii volcanic island chain. In theory, the Samoa hotspot is based on the Pacific Tectonic Plate traveling over a fixed hotspot located deep underneath the Samoan Islands. The Samoa hotspot includes the Samoan Islands (American Samoa and Samoa), and extends to the islands of Uvea or Wallis Island (Wallis and Futuna) and Niulakita (Tuvalu), as well as the submerged Pasco banks and Alexa Bank. As the Pacific Plate moves slowly over the hotspot, thermal activity builds up and is released in magma plume spewing through the Earth's crust, forming each island in a chain. The Samoa islands generally lie in a straight line, east to west, in the same direction of the tectonic plate 'drifting' over the hotspot. Mt Matavanu eruption on Savai'i island, 1905. A characteristic of a “classic” hotspot, like the Hawaii hotspot, results in islands located further from the hotspot being progressively older with newer and younger islands closest to the fixed hotspot, like the Loihi Seamount, the only submarine volcano which has been studied in detail by scientists. The scientific research from Loihi has resulted in a 'Hawaii' model for hotspots primarily limited to the information gathered from the Hawaii islands. However, the Samoa hotspot is currently an enigma for scientists. In the Samoa Islands, the easternmost island of Ta'u and the westernmost island of Savai'i have both erupted in the past 150 years. The most recent eruption on Sava'i occurred with Mount Matavanu (1905–1911) and on Ta'u in 1866. Vailulu'u In 1975, geophysicist Rockne Johnson discovered the Vailulu'u Seamount, 45 km east of Ta'u island in American Samoa which has since been studied by an international team of scientists. Within the summit crater of Vailulu'u is an active underwater volcanic cone called Nafanua, named after a war goddess in Samoan mythology. The study of Vailulu'u provides scientists with another possible model for hotspots as an alternative to the Hawaii hotspot model. An important difference between Vailulu'u and Loihi in Hawaii, is a total lack of tholeiitic basalt compositions at Vailulu'u although both are located at the easternmost point of their respective island chains. The northern Tonga Islands (Vava'u and Niuatoputapu) are moving away from Fiji on the Australian plate at rates of about 130 mm/yr and 160 mm/yr, respectively, while Niue and Rarotonga on the Pacific plate are approaching the Australian plate at about 80 mm/yr. This implies that Pacific plate is tearing at the corner of the trench-transform boundary at a rate that is the sum of these two (160 + 80) 240 mm/yr.

She was a senior disciple of Ba Khin, a vipassana master, and fulfilled his aspiration to teach Buddhist meditation in the west. Life and works Mya Thwin was born on 12 March 1925 in Moulmein, British Burma. She grew up with her grand parents as her mother died in child birth. Through her marriage to Chit Tin she came into contact with Ba Khin when her husband was transferred to the Accountant General's Office in Rangoon. Sayamagyi Daw Mya Thwin took her first course in 1953 at the International Meditation Centre (IMC) founded by Ba Khin to teach meditation to his office staff. As her progress was very rapid, Ba Khin visited her and her husband every day after the course and continued to teach her. In May of the same year, in a second 10-day course, she completed her training. Ba Khin then invited the Venerable Webu Sayadaw to the IMC to confirm or correct his teaching. The Webu Sayadaw expressed his approval of Mya Thwin's penetration of the Buddha Dhamma by saying Sadhu three times after meeting her. After this Mya Thwin was always with Ba Khin when he taught students, both foreigners and Burmese. She and Mr. S N Goenka became Ba Khin's foremost disciples. When the first president of independent Burma came to the IMC, she helped him greatly in his progress. He told Ba Khin: “Ma Mya Thwin is not an ordinary disciple”, and he started to address her with the title Sayama (Lady teacher) and would pay respects to her before and after he meditated, a very unusual thing to do for such a senior person. Later the deputy prime minister Lun Baw, also a devoted meditation student of the IMC, addressed her as “Mother” though she was much younger than him. After Ba Khin's death in 1971, Mya Thwin was requested by the president of the Vipassana Association of the Accountant General's Office, Tint Yee, to take over the responsibility for the center. She agreed and continued to teach there with the help of her husband Chit Tin. On request of foreign students who came in increasing numbers, she agreed to travel abroad to teach Vipassana meditation. She and her husband left Burma in October 1978 to fulfill their teacher Ba Khin's aspiration to make the teachings of the Buddha available in the west. Travelling and teaching for over 30 years Mya Thwin established centers throughout the world including five centers with pagodas for meditation: United Kingdom in 1979, Western Australia in 1981, United States (Maryland) in 1988, New South Wales (near Sydney) in 1989, and Austria (in Karinthia) in 1990. All the centers outside Myanmar have regional teachers who conduct courses or assist the senior teachers when they are present. All the five centers have Dhamma Yaungchi Pagodas, which are replicas of the pagoda at the IMC Yangon. She taught over 450 ten-day meditation courses for thousands of people during her travels in Asia, Australia, the Americas and Europe. She also held over 20 Bhikkhu ordinations for those of her students who wanted to experience the advantages of meditating in robes, the garb of the Buddhas. In March 1994, the Burmese government awarded Mya Thwin the title of Maha-Sadhamma-Jotika Dhaja for her outstanding achievements in teaching the Buddha's teachings outside Myanmar. She died on Saturday 28 January 2017.https://internationalmeditationcentre.org/teachers  References  Sources  *The Way to Ultimate Calm, Selected Discourses of Venerable Webu Sayadaw, Kandy 2001. *Truth Must Triumph, Heddington UK, 1999. *Art of crossing cultures, Craig Storti. *The Buddhist directory, United States of America & Canada.

He served as Subhas Chandra Bose's chief of staff in Singapore, and accompanied Bose on his last fatal flight from Taipei to Tokyo, sharing the last moments of his life. Rahman also played an important role in the First Kashmir War. Convinced that Maharaja Hari Singh was out to exterminate the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir, he joined Major General Zaman Kiani, in launching a rebellion against the Maharaja from Gujrat in Pakistani Punjab.; : \\"GHQ Azad, originally called the Planning Cell, was created in October [1947] and located in Rampiari Palace, Gujrat. It was headed by Major General M. Z. Kiani, who was designated C-in-C Azad Kashmir Forces, and manned by Brigadier Habibur Rehman as the Chief of Staff, and other senior officers.\\": \\"Habibur Rehman was already apprehensive of the dark designs of the Dogras and wanted to do something. He was in possession of reliable information from a relative, Captain Afzal, that the Dogra Commander of the Brigade at Nowshera had received secret instructions from the Maharaja to clear the border belt of Muslims.... Yet he did not lose courage and collected a band of dedicated men from Bhiring village of Bhimber tehsil and other areas inhabited by ex-servicemen.... armed with Frontier-made rifles, Habibur Rehman wanted to push out the Dogra garrison at Bhimber town...\\" Rehman and his volunteer force launched an attack on the Bhimber town.Nazir Salehria, retired Pakistani Army officer, in : \\"Brigadier Habib ur Rehman organised us into a regular force and 15 Azad Kashmir battalion was raised. Unfortunately this battalion has not been mentioned anywhere.\\" But, the records of the 11th Cavalry of the Pakistan Army indicate that their efforts did not succeed, and eventually the Cavalry was responsible for conquering Bhimber. Early life and education Habib ur Rahman, son of Raja Manzoor Ahmad Khan was born in the village of Panjeri, Bhimber district in Jammu and Kashmir on 22 December 1913.July 1938 Indian Army List He was educated in schools in Panjeri and went to obtain graduation in Jammu. Afterwards, Rahman was enrolled at the Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College, Dehradun and subsequently the Indian Military Academy. Military career Rahman was commissioned a Second Lieutenant on the Special List, Indian Land Forces on 15 July 1936 and was attached to the 2nd battalion of Duke of Wellington's Regiment from 10 August 1936.October 1936 Indian Army List He was appointed to the Indian Army and was posted to 1st Battalion of the 14th Punjab Regiment, which was called \\"Sher Dil Paltan\\" on the 10 August 1937.October 1937 Indian Army ListJuly 1938 Indian Army List As an officer his pay was hundred rupees per month. He was promoted Lieutenant 1 December 1937July 1938 Indian Army List His battalion moved from Lahore to Secunderabad in September 1940. =Overseas move= Soon after the second week of February 1941, Rahman and his battalion were ordered to move overseas. He left Secunderabad on 3 March 1941 for Penang Island and from there to Ipoh, north of Kuala Lumpur in Malaya. After about two months stay at Ipoh, their Battalion moved to Sungei Pattani in South Kedah as a part of the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Garrett. The 3rd Cavalry was allotted the defence of the Island of Penang. He disembarked at Singapore and reported at 7 MRC, Mixed Reinforcement Camp at Bidadari. From Singapore he was sent to Jitra situated on the main road to Thailand, south of the border. He arrived Jitra on 5 December 1941. =World War II= Following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Singapore on the early morning of 7 December 1941, the United States declared war on Japan. The Japanese forces completely destroyed the squadrons of the Royal Air Force at Sungei, Alor Star and Kota Bharu airfields. On 11 December 1941, 1/14th Punjab Regiment fought a pitched battle at Changlun near the Thai frontier. Rahman was Battalion Signal Officer with his C.O. Col. L. V. Fitzpatrick who remained nearest to the front line. The Battle of Changlun went on for eight hours and was lost. The 1/14th Punjabs were not reformed after this battle. The town of Alor Star had also fallen. On 13 December 1941 they arrived at Miami Beach near Penang. They were taken to 3 M.R.C. in Penang. At this time Penang was hurriedly evacuated . They were given the duty to guard a railway bridge at Nibong Tabol. They guarded the bridge for another two days till the arrival of the Japanese. Then they were ordered to withdraw to Ipoh where Rahman fell ill with malaria. He was hospitalised and sent to Singapore. By the dawn of 9 February 1942, almost two divisions of the Japanese had landed on the soil of Singapore. On 10 February 1942, 7 MRC was moved to Raffles Square, a business area. By that time it was apparent that the surrender of Singapore was imminent. On 13 February 1942, Raffles Square was bombed. 7MRC suffered heavily with about 300 killed and many more wounded. The second-in-Command of 7 MRC, an English Major and Rahman had a difficult job disposing of corpses. They dropped them in the ocean. Singapore capitulated on 15 February 1942 and British Forces surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese. The defeated and demoralised Indian soldiers collected themselves at Farrer Park in Singapore. Major Fujiwara addressing the POWs expressed that it was his firm belief that world peace and the liberation of Asia could not be achieved and maintained without a free and independent India. He further said that if Indian POWs in Malaya were prepared to fight British imperialism for the cause of achieving the independence of their motherland, the Imperial Japanese Government would advance all out- support. He suggested the formation of the Indian National Army. He handed over all the POWs in Malaya to Capt. Mohan Singh, the G.O.C. of the Indian National Army.  Indian National Army Formation of the INA= At the stage on Farrer Park Capt. Mohan Singh addressed the POWs and decided to form an organised and disciplined power in the form of Indian National Army. The erstwhile POWs were to become now the soldiers of India's \\"Army of Liberation\\", the army that was to fight under its own leadership, with a real and just cause to wage war. Mohan Singh was from the same unit from which was Rahman. He was a close friend of Rahman. On 17 February 1942, Khan decided to join the Indian National Army. Next morning Capt. Mohan Singh issued orders to march off all the units of various camps on the island where the units were to occupy their allotted accommodation. Rahman's unit was to proceed to Nee Soon Camp. Nee Soon village was situated away from the main town of Singapore. This camp was the Regimental Centre of the Singapore Royal Artillery. The Japanese Headquarters had asked the Supreme Headquarters to provide 200 officers to guard the British and Australian prisoners of war at Changi Camp. Rahman took the risk and volunteered his services for this unpleasant task. At Changi Camp, Rahman and other Indians were asked by the Japanese to give up the British drill and words of command and adopt Japanese ones. Within a fortnight they learnt the Japanese drill and words of command. Here they kept the Allied POWs in five separate Camps – Australian Camp, Hospital area, 9th Indian Division Camp, 11th Indian Division Camp and 18th British Camp. Its own officer, usually a General residing in the Camp, commanded each Camp. Changi was under military control of Japanese as well as Rahman. Rahman inculcated amongst the prisoners the feelings of national unity, discipline and keen sense of duty through daily lectures personally delivered by him. After some time at Changi Camp Rahman fell seriously ill. He was released from the command of the Changi Garrison and sent to Seletar Camp and was admitted to POW Hospital. =Shaping the INA= Rahman's health improved at Seletar Camp. He along with over thirty important senior officers from among the Indian prisoners of war attended the Bidadari Conference called by Captain Mohan Singh at Bidadari Camp in Singapore on 24 April 1942. The resolutions of this Conference, came to be known as the Bidadari Resolutions, formed the backbone of formation of INA. As resolved at the Tokyo Conference, a representative conference of the Indians who lived in East Asian countries was held at Bangkok on 15 June 1942, which continued for 10 days. Thirty INA volunteers nominated by Mohan Singh among the Indian prisoners of war attended it. A resolution was passed at this conference known as Bangkok Resolution. Rahman got his National Commission on 1 September 1942 and was posted as major on 10 September 1942. He was still ill so he was attached to the Reinforcement Group. The first review of INA was held at Singapore Padang in front of the Municipal Buildings on 2 October 1942, Rahman attended this function as an observer. The progress in recuperating Rahman's health was slow. He was recommended a month's leave and sent to Penang. He returned to Singapore in the middle of November 1942. The Japanese had not yet ratified the Bangkok resolutions not recognised the INA as an independent army. General Mohan Singh had lost confidence in the Japanese. In the beginning of December 1942, the Japanese asked the INA Headquarters to dispatch an advance party to move to Burma so as to prepare camps and accommodation for the main body of INA. Meanwhile, differences developed between Mohan Singh and the Japanese. The Japanese arrested General Mohan Singh on 29 December 1942. There was a period of crisis due to suspense and indecision. On the advice of Rash Behari Bose Khan continued in INA. They went all over the Island and up-country to urge men to remain in the INA. Meanwhile, Subhas Chandra Bose (Netaji) was trying to come to the East. In anticipation of Netaji's arrival, the revived INA was reorganised under its new headquarters known as Directorate of Military Bureau (DMB) with Col. J. R. Bhonsle as the Director. Rahman was appointed as Deputy Quartermaster General (DQMG) in the \\"Q\\" Branch at the Army Headquarters. He was to look after the Technical Branch and was responsible for the accommodation also. The Army Headquarters was organised by the middle of March 1943 and was duly gazetted on 17 April 1943. On appointment Khan took up the task of collection of kit and clothing of those personnel who decided to leave the INA. When Netaji arrived on 2 July 1943 in Singapore and the Army was enlarged in December 1943, Khan was transferred to be the 2nd-in-Command of the 5th Guerilla Regiment. =The 5th Guerrilla Regiment= Khan was appointed Second-in-Command in December 1943, and raised the 5th Guerrilla regiment at Bidadari in Singapore. Apart from helping in raising the regiment Khan was responsible for training, discipline, morale and welfare of the troops. The 5th Guerrilla Regiment was formed as part of the 2nd INA Division, which was organised under the command of Col. N.S. Bhagat consequent on the 1st Division's move to the Front. On 30 March 1944, the 5th Guerrilla Regiment moved to Ipoh in Perak state of Malaya. Khan proceeded with the advance party to make necessary arrangements for the Regiment. =Move to Burma= Khan was sent to front at Alor Star in Infantry Regiment at Jitra. On 15 July 1944 they left Jitra for onward journey Kawashi, Mergui and Tavoy through Thailand and then to Moulmein and Rangoon in Burma. They had a period of long stay at Bangkok. From Bangkok they flew on 21 August 1944 over to Rangoon by Netaji's personal aircraft, the \\"Azad Hind\\". At Rangoon they were accommodated in Mingaladon Camp about from Rangoon. Khan was here officiating as the Deputy Adjutant General (DAG) and also the Deputy quartermaster General (DGMG)as well as the Commandant of the officer training school of INA when the first anniversary of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind came about. As part of the celebrations of the anniversary, the review of the 2nd Division of the INA was arranged at Mingaladon. It was part of duties of Khan to make arrangements and issue orders for the ceremonial parade at the vast parade ground. The parade was held on 18 October 1944. =Subhas Chandra Bose= Khan met Subhas Chandra Bose on 15 October 1944 at his residence in Rangoon. He again met him on 26 October 1944 after which Khan was made Brigade Commander of the Jawaharlal Nehru Brigade. Towards the end of 1943, \\"The Nehru\\" was put under the First Division. It moved to Burma in early 1944 and arrived at Mandalay. The Nehru Brigade was deployed in the Myingyan area with the object of defending it against enemy attack, which appeared imminent consequent on their withdrawal from Imphal. In the middle of December 1944, the Japanese Army Commander General S. Katamura visited The Nehru Brigade along with the general came Col. I. Fujiwara, the greatest supporter of the INA and one of the originators of the idea among the Japanese. Khan was advised to expect the worst so that there was no disappointment later. Towards end of 1944, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose gave Khan the command of 4th Guerrilla Regiment also called the Nehru Brigade. His regiment distinguished itself in the battlefield. The Nehru Brigade was to hold the Irrawaddy River from Nyaungu in north to Pangan in south, both towns inclusive, and to hold the enemy crossing the Irrawaddy at those places. Khan formed an advance party from 9th Battalion and left for Pagan on 29 December 1944. Khan ordered the move of battalions to leave Myingyan by 4 February 1945 so as to be in their respective positions by 8 February 1945. Khan ensured all the arrangements. The Nehru Brigade held the Irrawaddy as planned. Khan kept his Headquarters at Tetthe during this operation. On 12 February 1945 the enemy planes carried out saturation bombing on INA defences. On 13/14 February night enemy launched an assault in front of the 8th battalion deployed at Pagon. These assaults were failed and the enemy had to withdraw. The Nehru Brigade kept on holding the Irrawaddy and this was the first victory of INA. After the failure at Pagan the enemy tried another assault crossing opposite Nyaungu by using outboard motors and rubber boats. This assault was also failed and hundreds of enemies were killed or drowned. Having failed the enemy had no other choice but to retreat. This was another victory of INA. This could not sustain and INA had to withdraw and Khan had to proceed to Pagan. Khan reached Pagan on 17 February 1945. On 23 February 1945, Col. Shah Nawaz visited the Commander of Khanjo Butai and discussed co- ordination of Indo-Japanese operations in the Popa and Kyauk Padaung area. Col. Sahgal was given the task to prepare Popa as a strong base with the view to take up an offensive role. Khan's Regiment, the 4th Guerrilla, was assigned the duty to check the enemy advance on to Kyauk Padaung from the west, where the British had established a strong bridgehead at Nyaungu. This was to be achieved by carrying out an extensive and persistent guerrilla warfare in the area between Popa, Kyauk Padaung line in the east and as far forward towards the Irrawaddy as possible as to deny the enemy the use of Nyaungu-Kyauk- Padaullg-Meiktila metalled road for supplying reinforcements and supplies to his forces fighting in the battle of Meiktila. Shah Nawaz arrived Popa on 12 March 1945 and relieved Khan forthwith to join his regiment. On 4 April 1945 his Division Commander, Colonel Shah Nawaz Khan, asked Khan to return from Khabok to Popa. By then 4th Guerrilla regiment had been in that area waging guerrilla warfare for over five weeks. Mount Popa and Kyaukpadaung was one pocket of resistance, which had so far defied all British attacks. Under constant raids by INA the British forces were forced to use longer routes that caused the British loss of time, greater consumption of petroleum products and frequent breakdowns of vehicles. From the beginning of April 1945 the strategic situation began to change rapidly. The enemy launched a three- pronged attack on Mount Popa and Kyaukpadaung area. On 5 April 1945 Khan was allotted the defence of Kyaukpadaung, south of Popa. In the second week of April there was daily bombing from air. Under the cover of this barrage the British forces advanced in their heavy tanks and armoured vehicles. There were very heavy casualties. The INA could not organise any defence. 2nd Division of the INA was to withdraw to Magwe, south on Irrawaddy. After completing the task of withdrawing from Magwe, they came to a village called Kanni. In the meantime, the Burmese army has declared war against Japan, and as such, the villagers did not co-operate with INA. Their retreat was fully under the control of General Aung San’s Army under the new name of People's National Army, after having established a parallel government extending their hold over about 50 villages. They crossed Irrawaddy at Kama to reach Prome on 1 May 1945. Most of INA officers and men could not cross the river and they were stranded on the east bank of Irrawaddy. It was apparent by then, that they had lost the war. Rangoon had already been vacated. From Prome they took southeasterly direction to retreat through the jungles of the Pegu Yomas. Eleven days after leaving Prome, they reached at village called Wata about west of Pegu. There they learnt that Germany had surrendered. Japan was being heavily bombed daily. The British forces had occupied Pegu. Rangoon fell during the last week of April. Herein they decided that the surviving forces of INA should surrender to the British. Officially, Bose died in a plane crash over Taiwan, while flying to Tokyo on 18 August 1945. It is believed that he was en route to the Soviet Union in a Japanese plane when it crashed in Taiwan, burning him fatally. However, his body was never recovered, and many theories have been put forward concerning his possible survival. One such claim is that Bose actually died in Siberia, while in Soviet captivity. Khan was the only Indian accompanying Subhas Chandra Bose and thus the only Indian witness at the time of his Death of Subhas Chandra Bose in a plane crash in Taihoku on 18 August 1945. Khan was taken prisoner by Allied forces and at the end repatriated to India. Several committees have been set up by the Government of India to probe into this matter. =Surrender of the INA= On 17 May 1945 the enemy encircled the Indian National Army. So they surrendered without any surrender ceremony. They were put into prison at Pegu. Shah Nawaz and Dhillon were taken to No. 3 Field Interrogation Centre under command of Major C. Ore on 18 May 1945. Later on 31 May, they were sent to Rangoon Central Jail. On 1945 Khan was brought to Calcutta by plane and from there, sent to Delhi by train. On 1945 he was put in the Red Fort and interrogated by Mr. Bannerjee of the Central Intelligence Department. The interrogation was over by the third week of July. On the August 1945, Shah Nawaz, Sahgal, Dhillon and Khan were jointly summoned to the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre for the first time. It was the beginning of the first INA trial at Red Fort. On 17 September 1945 they were served a copy of charge sheet. The main charge was waging war against the King. The news of trial was made public through the press and All India Radio. =Trial= At the conclusion of the war, the government of British India brought some of the captured INA soldiers to trial on treason charges. The prisoners would potentially face the death penalty, life imprisonment or a fine as punishment if found guilty. After the war, Lt. Col. Shahnawaz Khan, Col. Habib ur Rahman Khan, Col. Prem Sehgal and Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon were put to trial at the Red Fort in Delhi for \\"waging war against the King Emperor\\", i.e., the British sovereign. The four defendants were defended by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai and others based on the defence that they should be treated as prisoners of war as they were not paid mercenaries but bonafide soldiers of a legal government, the Provisional Government of Free India, or the Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind, \\"however misinformed or otherwise they had been in their notion of patriotic duty towards their country\\" and as such they recognised the free Indian state as their sovereign and not the British sovereign. The historical trial of Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon, Prem Kumar Sahgal, Shah Nawaz Khan and Habib ur Rahman at the Red Fort began on 5 November 1945 by a General Court Martial for the charge of waging war against the King. When the trial began a mass demonstration was going on outside the Red Fort. People gave voice to their resentment on the trials by shouting: > Lal Qile se aaee awaz, > Sahgal Dhillon Habib Shah Nawaz, > Charoon ki ho umar daraz (Meaning – Comes the voice from the Red Fort > Sahgal, Dhillon, Habib, Shah Nawaz, May the Four live long) The New Year's Eve 31 December 1945 was the last day of trial. The trial marked a significant turning point in India's struggle for Independence and Col. Khan along with his three colleagues Col. Prem Kumar Sahgal, Col. Dhillon and Maj. Gen. Shah Nawaz Khan became symbol of India fighting for freedom. The verdict of trial came on 1 January 1946. All four were found guilty of waging war against the King Emperor. Having found the accused guilty of the charge of waging war, the court was bound to sentence the accused either to death or to deportation for life. No finding or sentence by court-martial is complete until confirmed by the Commander-in-Chief, Claude Auchinleck. Auchinleck, taking into consideration the prevailing circumstances, decided to treat all four accused in the same way in the matter of sentence, and decided to remit the sentences of deportation of life against all of the three accused, and they were later released. The incidence of release the Four members of the INA was of momentous significance at national level. The unprecedented publicity in the national papers and the media during the proceedings of trial enhanced the credibility and legitimacy of the freedom struggle launched by Indian National Army. On the following day of the release, 4 January 1946 the whole of Delhi and its neighbourhood had gathered to participate the rally never organised in the history of Delhi. =Enquiry into Bose's death= In 1956, the government constituted a committee to look into the circumstances around Subhas Chandra Bose's death. Major General, Shah Nawaz Khan, headed the committee, whose members included Suresh Chandra Bose. The Committee began its work in April 1956 and concluded four months later when two members of the Committee, Shah Nawaz Khan and S. N. Maitra said that Netaji had indeed died in the air crash at Taihoku (Japanese for Taipei) in Formosa (now Taiwan), on 18 August 1945. They stated that his ashes were kept in Japan's Renkoji Temple and should be reinstated to India. The third member, Suresh Chandra Bose, submitted a separate report of dissent, saying that there was no air crash at all. The Government of India accepted the majority decision. First Kashmir War After Independence Muhammad Ali Jinnah was delighted with Rahman joining the government service and advised him in writing to visit and report about the current situation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir in Srinagar. Following this request he went to visit the Prime Minister of Jammu & Kashmir Ram Chandra Kak and Maharaja Hari Singh to better understand their views on the State of Jammu and Kashmir joining Pakistan, as Jammu and Kashmir was a Muslim majority state. In 1947 it was clear that an alternative plan was needed to bring Kashmir under Pakistan's control. Rahman tried his best to organise all of the ex-army people to wrest control of Jammu and Kashmir. Rahman led many battles against the Dogra forces, particularly in Bhimber and Kotli. Under the leadership of Rahman the Muslims of Bhimber rose against the Dogra rulers and separated Bhimber from the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Following the Indo- Pakistani War of 1947, Rahman chose to settle in Pakistan and joined the Central Superior Services of Pakistan, Deputy Commissioner Bannu, Chief Administrator Northern Area Gilgit-Baltistan, Additional Defence Secretary Government of Pakistan, & Member Azad Kashmir Council. Awards and honours In recognition of his contribution to the \\"independence movement\\" the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government awarded Rahman the following honours: * Fateh-e- Bhimber (Liberator of Bhimber). * Fakhr-e-Kashmir * Ghazi-e-Kashmir The Degree college of Bhimber is named after him. Government of Pakistan awarded him the civil and military honours: *Sitara-e-Pakistan *Nishan-e-Imtiaz (military), *Tamgha-e-Imtiaz *Tamgha-i-Khidmat (military) Death Rahman died and was buried on 26 December 1978 in his ancestral village of Panjeri, in Bhimber, Pakistan administered Kashmir.

Football career  Sandy Tait was one of 13 children and worked as a pitboy leading the pit ponies while beginning his career at local club Glenbuck Athletic. He had a brief spell with Ayr and spent three years with Royal Albert but no league appearances are recorded for either of these initial clubs. Tait had a loan spell with Rangers in 1891–92 making his debut at left back in the Scottish League on 12 September 1891 in a 6–1 win at Vale of Leven. Tait made 6 appearances in season 1891–92 before being replaced at left back by Dunbar. Tait joined Motherwell for the following two seasons, making 17 appearances in 1893–94. In 1894 Tait left Motherwell and joined Preston North End making his First Division debut at right back in a 3–1 win v Nottingham Forest on 23 March 1895 and made 3 appearances as Preston finished in 4th place in 1894–95. In the following season Tait was a regular first at right back with England international Bob Holmes at left back then switching over to left back with Holmes at right back. Tait made 26 appearances as Preston finished 9th in 1895–96. On 23 November 1895 Preston visited Small Heath at their Coventry Road ground on a blustery afternoon with a bitterly cold wind. Tait was playing at right back with a half time score of 2–1 to Small Heath when the Preston goalkeeper John Wright, playing only his second game, was found to have a fractured wrist from an accidental first half collision. Tait went into goal and Preston played on with 10 men equalising but then conceding three late goals to lose 2–5. When Preston finished 4th in the table in 1896–97 Tait began at left back but lost his place to Hugh Dunn and made only 16 appearances. In 1897–98 Tait played at right back in the first match and the last four but made only 8 appearances in the season as Preston slipped to 12th place of 16 teams in the First Division. Tait shared the full back duties with Holmes and Dunn again in 1898–99 making 26 appearances mainly at left back. After playing 76 matches Tait moved on to Tottenham Hotspur in the Southern League. While with Preston Tait was known as \\"Terrible Tait\\" a reference to his ferocious tackling and took his football very seriously but always played the game to the rules and was never booked. The full back joined the Spurs making his debut at left back at Millwall Athletic in a 3–1 win on 2 September 1899 and made 32 appearances in 1899–1900 when Tottenham were Southern League champions. Tait played at left back in all 8 FA Cup ties and was a member of the Lilywhites 1901 FA Cup Final winning side v Sheffield United after a replay. In 1900–01 Tait made 22 appearances in the Southern League as Tottenham finished 5th. Tait was also a regular for the Tottenham side playing in the Western League. Tottenham rose to runners up in the Southern League in 1901–02 when Tait made 26 appearances. Tait made 25 appearances scoring one goal, a penalty in a 3–1 win v New Brompton, during 1902–03 when Tottenham finished 4th in the Southern League. Tait continued to play in the Western league side that ran alongside the Southern League matches. Tottenham were runners up in the Southern League in 1903–04 when Tait made a further 25 appearances. In season 1904–05 Tait made another 25 appearances at left back scoring one goal a penalty in a 2–0 win v Watford. In season 1905–06 Tait made 27 appearances scoring one goal as Tottenham finished in 5th place. Tait was the regular left back again in 1906–07 making 24 appearances as Tottenham reached 6th place in the Southern League table. In 1907–08 Burton took over as the left back restricting Tait to a single appearance in the Southern League side. Tait was captain of Tottenham during the latter part of his career at White Hart Lane. He had excellent positional sense and a football brain. He was not especially fast but his tackling ability carried him through. He gave Spurs eight seasons of sterling service playing a total of 349 first team games, which comprised 207 in the Southern League, 78 in the Western League, 15 in the London League, 14 in the Southern and District Combination League and 35 in the FA Cup, with five goals in all competitions. He later moved on to Leyton first as a player then manager before finishing his career as manager of Croydon Common for whom he also made a few South Eastern League and London League appearances.

In some situations, it is useful to know if the data is corrupted without decoding all of it so that appropriate action can be taken in response. For example, in communication, if the receiver encounters a corrupted code, it can request the data be re-sent, which could increase the accuracy of said data. Similarly, in data storage, these codes can allow for damaged data to be recovered and rewritten properly. In contrast, locally decodable codes use a small number of bits of the codeword to probabilistically recover the original information. The fraction of errors determines how likely it is that the decoder correctly recovers the original bit; however, not all locally decodable codes are locally testable. Clearly, any valid codeword should be accepted as a codeword, but strings that are not codewords could be only one bit off, which would require many (certainly more than a constant number) probes. To account for this, testing failure is only defined if the string is off by at least a set fraction of its bits. This implies words of the code must be longer than the input strings by adding some redundancy.  Definition  To measure the distance between two strings, the Hamming distance is used :\\\\Delta(x,y)=\\\\\\\\{i:x_i eq y_i\\\\\\\\} The distance of a string w from a code C:\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^k\\\\to\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n is computed by :\\\\Delta(w,C)=\\\\min_x\\\\\\\\{\\\\Delta(w,C(x))\\\\\\\\} Relative distances are computed as a fraction of the number of bits :\\\\delta(x,y)=\\\\Delta(x,y)/n \\\\text{ and } \\\\delta(w,C)=\\\\Delta(w,C)/n A code C:\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^k\\\\to{0,1}^n is called q-local \\\\delta-testable if there exists a Turing machine M given random access to an input w that makes at most q non-adaptive queries of w and satisfies the following: :* For any x\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^k and w=C(x), Pr[M^w(1^k)=1]=1. In other words, M accepts given access to any codeword of C. :* For w\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^n such that \\\\delta(w,C)>\\\\delta, Pr[M^w(1^k)=1]\\\\leq1/2. M must reject strings \\\\delta-far from C at least half the time.  Limits  It remains an open question whether there are any locally testable codes of linear size, but there are several constructions that are considered \\"nearly linear\\": # Polynomial arbitrarily close to linear; for any \\\\epsilon>0, n=k^{1+\\\\epsilon}. # Functions of the form n=k^{1+\\\\epsilon(k)}, where \\\\epsilon(k) is a function tending toward 0. This makes n closer to linear as k increases. For example: #* 1/\\\\log \\\\log k #* 1/(\\\\log k)^c for some c\\\\in (0,1) #* \\\\exp((\\\\log \\\\log \\\\log k)^c)/\\\\log k for c\\\\in (0,1) These have both been achieved, even with constant query complexity and a binary alphabet, such as with n=k^{1+1/(\\\\log k)^c} for any c\\\\in (0,1). The next nearly linear goal is linear up to a polylogarithmic factor; n=\\\\text{poly}(\\\\log k)*k. Nobody has yet to come up with a linearly testable code that satisfies this constraint.  Connection with probabilistically checkable proofs  Locally testable codes have a lot in common with probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). This should be apparent from the similarities of their construction. In both, we are given q random nonadaptive queries into a large string and if we want to accept, we must with probability 1, and if not, we must accept no more than half the time. The major difference is that PCPs are interested in accepting x if there exists a w so that M^w(x)=1. Locally testable codes, on the other hand, accept w if it is part of the code. Many things can go wrong in assuming a PCP proof encodes a locally testable code. For example, the PCP definition says nothing about invalid proofs, only invalid inputs. Despite this difference, locally testable codes and PCPs are similar enough that frequently to construct one, a prover will construct the other along the way.  Examples  Hadamard code = One of the most famous error-correcting codes, the Hadamard code, is a locally testable code. A codeword x is encoded in the Hadamard code to be the linear function f(y)={\\\\sum_i {x_i y_i}} (mod 2). This requires listing out the result of this function for every possible y, which requires exponentially more bits than its input. To test if a string w is a codeword of the Hadamard code, all we have to do is test if the function it encodes is linear. This means simply checking if w(x)\\\\oplus w(y)=w(x\\\\oplus y) for x and y uniformly random vectors (where \\\\oplus denotes bitwise XOR). It is easy to see that for any valid encoding w, this equation is true, as that is the definition of a linear function. Somewhat harder, however, is showing that a string that is \\\\delta- far from C will have an upper bound on its error in terms of \\\\delta. One bound is found by the direct approach of approximating the chances of exactly one of the three probes yielding an incorrect result. Let A, B, and C be the events of w(x), w(y), and w(x\\\\oplus y) being incorrect. Let E be the event of exactly one of these occurring. This comes out to :\\\\begin{align}P(E) &\\\\geq P(A\\\\cup B\\\\cup C)-3*P(A\\\\cup B) &\\\\geq 3*P(A)-3*P(A\\\\cup B)-3*P(A\\\\cup B) &\\\\geq 3\\\\delta-6\\\\delta^2\\\\end{align} This works for 0<\\\\delta\\\\leq5/16, but shortly after, 3\\\\delta-6\\\\delta^2<\\\\delta. With additional work, it can be shown that the error is bounded by :f(x) = \\\\begin{cases} 3\\\\delta-6\\\\delta^2 & : 0\\\\leq\\\\delta\\\\leq 5/16  45/128 & : 5/16\\\\leq \\\\delta\\\\leq45/128  \\\\delta & :45/128 \\\\leq \\\\delta\\\\leq 1/2 \\\\end{cases} For any given \\\\delta, this only has a constant chance of false positives, so we can simply check a constant number of times to get the probability below 1/2. = Long code = The Long code is another code with very large blowup which is close to locally testable. Given an input 0\\\\leq i\\\\leq2^k (note, this takes k bits to represent), the function that returns the i^{th} bit of the input, f_i(x)=x_i, is evaluated on all possible 2^k-bit inputs 0\\\\leq x\\\\leq2^{2^k}, and the codeword is the concatenation of these (of length n=2^{2^k}). The way to locally test this with some errors is to pick a uniformly random input x and set y=x, but with a small chance of flipping each bit, \\\\mu>0. Accept a function f as a codeword if f(x)=f(y). If f is a codeword, this will accept f as long as x_i was unchanged, which happens with probability 1-\\\\mu. This violates the requirement that codewords are always accepted, but may be good enough for some needs. Other locally testable codes include Reed-Muller codes (see locally decodable codes for a decoding algorithm), Reed-Solomon codes, and the short code.

Early life and career Ernst von Schimmelmann was born in Dresden to Baron Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann (1724–1782) and Caroline von Schimmelmann, who was the foster daughter of Heinrich Ernst von Gersdorf (1704-1755) in Dresden. His father was a successful merchant who made a fortune in war and became affiliated with the Danish government after moving to Hamburg and buying Schloss Ahrensburg in Schleswig-Holstein. Ernst studied economics in Europe and worked for his father. Career From 1782, Ernst von Schimmelmann became a key figure in Denmark's financial administration, part of a so-called Trefoil of Counts which was completed by A. P. Bernstorff and Christian Ditlev Reventlow. Due to disputes with the Minister of State, Ove Høegh-Guldberg, he had to resign in 1783 but the following year he took part in the coup d'état against Høegh- Guldberg and was appointed Minister of Finance in the new government, a post he held until 1813. From 1824 to 1831 he was Minister of Foreign Affairs. In 1790 he was awarded the Order of the Elephant, the highest Danish decoration, for his work. =Plantation owner and views on slavery= Constitution Hill, the Schimmelmann family plantation on St. Croix Sølyst in Klampenborg He contributed to the abolition of slave trade in Denmark by showing in a report, how Danish slave trade was inhumane and led to deficits. In the report, he also accounted for how better treatment of slaves in the Danish West Indies could reduce the large child mortality, which each year substantially reduced the slave population. Schimmelmann was not against slavery, but rather the ghastly Atlantic slave trade. Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann was a slave owner himself, owning a large sugar plantation on the island Saint Croix and being a shareholder in a company that transported slaves from the Gold Coast. He has been formally portrayed with his Negro slave in Copenhagen, where his family held several slaves. As Minister of Finance, Schimmelmann's work to stop slave trade was started in 1792. Previously there had been no restrictions to trade, and as a compensation, he introduced government- subsidized loans for purchasing slaves prior to the ban. The Schimmelmann family became the richest family in Denmark in the 18th century largely due to the sugar trade with the West Indies, and dominated the economic life in Denmark. Family In 1775, Schimmelmann married Countess Emilie Caroline Rantzau, who died of tuberculosis 5 years later at the age of 28. Schimmelmann remarried in 1782, and moved with his new wife Charlotte (née Schubart) to his country home Sølyst in Klampenborg. In 1782, he raised a Classicistic monument called Emiliekilde in Klampenborg to the memory of his first wife. Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann and his family are buried in St. Peter's Church, Copenhagen (Sankt Petri Kirk), a church for which he was patron from 1800 until his death. In culture and legacy Schimmelmann is one of the characters in the historical novel Druknehuset (Samlernes Forlag. 2008) by Maria Helleberg. The plot starts when a drenched corpse shows up on his doorstep. The street Schimmelmannsvej in Charlottenlund is named after him.

After supporting the Danish king as the head of the Danish bank, he was rewarded, became a nobleman, plantation owner and finance minister. From 1774 he was involved in the project of digging the Eider Canal. Early life and career His father Diedrich Jacob was a merchant and city councillor in Demmin, Swedish Pommerania, who sent him out learning the trade in Stettin.His brother Jacob, a theology student, translated the Edda into german. In 1746 he set up a supplies store in sugar, coffee and tobacco in Dresden. On 4 March 1747, at the age of 23, he married then 17-year-old Caroline Tugendreich Friedeborn. In 1755, Schimmelmann was responsible for tariff collection in Kursachsen. By the end of 1756 he delivered grain and flour to the Prussian army and was appointed as Geheimrat. In December 1756 or 1757 he bought pillaged Meissen porcelain from the Prussian king, which were shipped in 110 cases to Hamburg, and auctioned on 11 July 1758.Matthias Claudius: Biographie eines Unzeitgemäßen by Martin Geck (He secretly returned a part to the Saxon king August III.Daniele Antonin (2014) Das weisse Gold, der Wittelsbacher – Zum Sammlungsbesitz des Meißener Porzellans der bayerischen Kurfürsten im 18. Jahrhundert, p. 157]) In April Frederick the Great ordered him to contact Veitel Heine Ephraim and Daniel Itzig and deliver silver to the two mint masters who were leasing all the Prussian mints.C. Degn (1974) Die Schimmelmanns im atlantische Dreieckshandel. Gewinn und Gewissen, p. 9 Already in July 1758 Schimmelmann leased the mint in Schwerin (Mecklenburg) from Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and started to compete with Ephraim & Itzig. Schimmelmann produced debased coins, but with a higher silver content than the debased Prussian coins.M. Kunzel (1994) Das Münzwesen Mecklenburgs von 1492 bis 1872, p. 162 Schimmelmann employed more than a hundred people at the end of 1759; one year later already almost 300 people.M. Kunzel (1994) p. 166-167 Connection with Denmark Ahrensburg Wandsbek with Schimmelmann mausoleum behind the church The city of Hamburg did not allow him to settle within the walls, but with a trick, using his bookkeeper he succeeded to buy a mansion in 1758. In 1759 he bought the Ahrensburg estate in Holstein (paying cash) and became a Danish citizen. Early 1761 Schimmelmann leased the mints in Neustrelitz and Rethwisch, Stormarn and ordered Abel Seyler and his partner Johann Martin Tilleman to produce worse coins.M. Kunzel (1994) p. 169-172, 248 The head of the Danish government, Count von Bernstorff, realized how Schimmelmann's talents as a merchant could benefit the state of Denmark during those times of financial duress. In July 1761 Schimmelmann became a financial advisor for the king, Frederik V of Denmark. Schimmelmann introduced an extraordinary income tax, to be paid in silver, which led to unrest in the country. In 1762 he bought an estate in Wandsbek, closer to Hamburg. He appointed Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi to improve the refining of silver and copper from debased coins through cupellation. Justi succeeded by using coal. In cooperation with his business partner Abel Seyler Schimmelmann produced large amounts of coins (so-called Heckmünzen), that were exported to various German states during the war. The furnace in Rethwisch was taken over by Veitel Ephraim in 1762 and stopped. The financial situation in Denmark at the time was dire, due to the large army of 20-25.000 soldiers stationed in Holstein, the rearmament following the aggression of Peter III of Russia in 1762, after the death of Frederick Charles, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg-Plön. Because it was hard for the Danish state to get loans at the time, Denmark had tried to get funds through seignorage, but this destabilized both the state and the banks responsible. Lacking men of financial capacity, Schimmelmann's talents and reputation was utilized to get favourable loans from Amsterdam to keep the Danish state and financial system afloat.During the Amsterdam banking crisis of 1763 Schimmelmann succeeded in getting a loan for 3.4 million Thaler from Dutch banks for Denmark. He left after a few days but came back within a few weeks. In the years 1762-1765, Schimmelmann continued his work of securing the Danish government, sometimes even through loans of his own.The Evolution of Nordic Finance by Steffen Elkiær Andersen, p. 54 Schimmelmann on his own part benefited from the connection with the Danish government both due to Denmark's neutrality being beneficial for trade, and for reasons of prestige. Negotiations soon led to Schimmelmann being appointed as second in command to the Danish attaché in Hamburg, and the connection with Denmark was solidified by buying property in Copenhagen and Himmerland. Schimmelmann received the title of Baron of Lindenborg and the Order of the Dannebrog (April 1762).  Influence on tax policies Schimmelmann Palace in Copenhagen To better the state's finances, Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann decided on an extraordinary poll tax in September 1762. It would have been too difficult at the time to create a progressive income tax, but the brutality of the poll tax led to civil unrest. However, it secured the state finances and stabilized the financial markets. An advisory board was created in December 1762 with von Schimmelmann as a member, through which he became de facto administrator of Denmark's taxes and deficit. With short interruptions, this influence over the state's finances continued until his death. Private business The Schimmelmann family's plantation on St. Croix in the Danish West Indies Besides his duties as overseer of Denmark's taxes, von Schimmelmann also ran his own private business, having bought in March or April 1763 several of the largest Danish sugar plantations in the Danish West Indies,A Vexing Gadfly: The Late Kierkegaard on Economic Matters by Eliseo Perez-Alvarez, p. 58 including La Grande Princesse near Christiansted and La Grange at Frederiksted on St. Croix, and a sugar refinery in Copenhagen for 400,000 rigsdaler. Schimmelmann became the largest plantation owners in the Danish West-Indies. The plantations used slave labour from the Danish trading stations in present-day Ghana. Through the work of von Schimmelmann's son Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann among others, the slave trade was banned in 1792 (effective from 1803). Schimmelmann also bought the Hammermøllen rifle factory north of Helsingør from the government for 70.000 Rigsdaler in 1768. Hellebækgård and the rifle factory, collectively known as Hellebækgård Manor (Danish: Hellebækgård Gods), was purchased by Schimmelmann in 1768. Schimmelmann commissioned Philip de Lange to remodel the house. In 1770, Schimmelmann moved the inn to another building while a chapel was installed in the east wing in its place. However, the goal of his public endeavours was mostly the development of foreign trade. When Schimmelmann sought after a trade surplus, he thought it was especially important for a country like Denmark, where fiat money was the only means of payment. Through trade, one could avoid a weakening (depreciation) of the currency compared to other countries. Besides, the development of trade would improve domestic wealth and thus also the tax revenue and state finances. He became connected with this important endeavour when he on 7 March 1767 was made deputy of the Kommercekollegiet (College of Commerce), and in December when he was given a seat in the newly formed Trade Balance Commission, which was supposed to investigate the state's finances and trade balance. Before Schimmelmann, other traders based in Copenhagen had realized that due to Denmark's lack of naturally exportable goods, it was necessary to start intermediary trade with overseas goods as compensation. This, among other factors, led to the formation of the Danish East India Company. Schimmelmann wanted to further this by establishing a free port in Copenhagen, which probably would have been accomplished had it not been for the influence of Johann Friedrich Struensee. Personal life Caroline von Schimmelmann, c. 1762 Schimmelmann had 9 children with his wife, 6 sons and 3 daughters. The oldest child was his son Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann, who followed in father's footsteps, becoming both Minister of Finance and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Besides his extensive career, von Schimmelmann enjoyed an excellent social life. His wife understood how to host great parties in the couple's winter home in Copenhagen, with royally approved masquerades. The summers were spent in the splendid castle Ahrensburg in Holstein. His circle of friends included the Danish statesmen with Bernstorff the Elder as the centre, with whom he agreed on other political subjects. For example, Schimmelmann co-negotiated an agreement settling the Gottorp Question on 27 May 1768 between Hamburg on one side, and Denmark and Gottorp on the other, where the Holstein-Gottorp territories of Schleswig-Holstein were taken over by the King. Relationship to Christian VII  Due to his many-faceted political influence, Schimmelmann came into close contact with the mentally-ill King Christian VII, with whom he also travelled abroad in 1768. His influence on the King was mostly due to the King's respect for von Schimmelmann's knowledge of trade and finance, and the King consulted with Schimmelmann on many occasions, e.g. regarding how much the country could spend on the army. Schimmelmann gained greater influence than Bernstorff ever could, and so it was von Schimmelmann, that convinced the King to banish the notorious prostitute Støvlet-Cathrine from Copenhagen in 1768. Besides reflecting his personal abilities, Schimmelmann's influence also shows the importance of money. In this context, it was unfortunate that he both served the role as financial advisor and made money by serving as a bank and lender for the state. The possible conflict of interests was often pointed out by his enemies, as he used his official position to earn money as a trader. Even though he in no way cheated the state, this still put him in a bad light  Age of Struensee  During von Schimmelmann's rising influence, Struensee came to power in 1770. As the insane King's physician, Struensee came to be de facto regent, and deposed many of the statesmen besides Schimmelmann, before finally being overthrown and executed in 1772. Schimmelmann, however, was still valuable to the new men in power, and so decided to work with the new leaders to salvage what he could of his old policies, as well as securing his own personal business endeavours. He succeeded beyond all expectations due to the goodwill of Struensee and his fellows, who made him a member of a commission established on 28 December 1770 with the purpose of settling the main economic questions of the day. His wife also made good use of the new political climate, becoming close friends with Struensee's lover, Queen Caroline Matilda. Von Schimmelmann's favourable position with Struensee influenced his relationship with former statesmen like Bernstorff once they came back into power. Schimmelmann, however, had a personal dislike for Struensee, who on his part wanted to sever the ties with Schimmelmann once possible. In the spring of 1771, Schimmelmann began withdrawing from his financial ties with the state. In the same year, the Treasury and the College of Commerce were closed down as the state financial system was being restructured to accommodate those in power, so Schimmelmann's influence was diminished. However, careful as he was, Schimmelmann never completely severed the ties with either Struensee or the old circle of power, and thus retained his place in the limelight.  Age of Guldberg  After Struensee's fall, the King's half-brother Frederick was made Regent, with his mother, Queen Juliana Maria and minister Ove Høegh-Guldberg as de facto rulers. This power transition enabled Schimmelmann to wield influence once again. Formally, his power lay in his position as a member of the Tax Board, and in a seat on an extraordinary financial committee created in October 1772. The Treasury was reinstated on 3 July 1773, with Schimmelmann as its director. Schimmelmann was also awarded the Order of the Elephant in 1773, and made Count in 1779. The records of the time reflect Schimmelmann's wide-ranging influence. At the start, he made sure that A. P. Bernstorff (Bernstorff the Younger) was reinstated and made head of the German Chancellery, and that Adolph Sigfried von der Osten was removed from the State Council in the spring of 1773. Furthermore, he facilitated the King's divorce from his unfaithful queen. Schimmelmann and Bernstorff the Younger were quite close, and Schimmelmann was often consulted in financial matters. One result of this was the nationalization of the Bank of Copenhagen in March 1773, which came under the Tax Board, and thus under Schimmelmann's personal leadership until his death. Meanwhile, Schimmelmann had great influence on the state's finances even though he did not have a seat on the College of Finance, an influence admiringly reflected in Bernstorff the Younger's letters about his absolute leadership over the state's fixed expenses and a great influence on other colleges. Bernstorff writes: “Schimmelmann is the soul in everything that happens in the internal affairs of the State. Even when decisions are made without him, it is as if he hastened their execution”. Naturally, Schimmelmann could not have had such influence unopposed. It was only possible with the support from the de facto rulers, Queen Juliana Maria and Høegh-Guldberg. Once again, those in power had a great appreciation for Schimmelmann's financial abilities, and he knew how to stay on good terms with them.  Mercantilism  Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann, ca. 1773 The effect of this cooperation shone through on the trade policy of the time. Thus, it was at this time that the protectionist system of mercantilism was carried through in the age of Guldberg, both with regards to industry and trade, even to the extent that the state became involved in shipbuilding, fishing and overseas trade. It was decided that the government should begin fishing to a great extent in the northern seas, capturing whales and seals. These activities were connected with the royal trade with then-colonies Greenland and Iceland, which required large-scale investments in shipbuilding. Although Guldberg showed great enthusiasm for these projects, it was Schimmelmann who was responsible for the government's attitude towards them, due to Schimmelmann's great influence over Guldberg and in every aspect of the state's finances. This was also the case for another important decision, which was thought to be very important for trade, namely the excavation of the so-called Eider Canal in Schleswig- Holstein, connecting the Baltic Sea and the North Sea using stretches of the Eider River, which was completed in 1784.  Death  By the end of the 1770s, Schimmelmann's health started to decline. Although he still found comfort in his work, it hurt him to see that his high hopes for Denmark's finances were disappointed as the country was hit by inflation, and when A. P. Bernstorff was fired in 1780. Heinrich Carl von Schimmelmann died - as the richest man in Denmark - in Copenhagen on 15 February 1782, at the age of 58. He is buried in Wandsbeck outside of Hamburg.  Legacy  Although always a merchant with an eye for his own advantage, Schimmelmann was dutiful in his work for his adopted country Denmark. From the first years after moving to Denmark, he gained great honors by saving the country from a dire financial situation, and later exhibiting extraordinary skills in many other areas. His legacy has been attacked – not without justification – because the state takeover of the Bank of Copenhagen in 1773 in the long run led to inflation due to the unhealthy temptation of printing money whenever the state needed it. The ways in which he allowed the state to intervene in the economic activities of the day had negative effects already in his lifetime.

They get a flat tire and as Karen changes the tire, Bree tells them that Edie used to live in the area after leaving Wisteria Lane. She recalls visiting Orson in prison for the first time, but cannot bring herself to see him because she is disgusted by the prison. Bree finds out from a prison guard that Edie has been visiting Orson every week. Bree goes to Edie's new home and questions her intentions. Edie questions Bree on why she has not been visiting Orson. She reminds Bree that Orson went to jail for her and that he must really love her, so Edie wonders why she cannot suck it up and go visit him once a month. She decides that Orson could do much better than Bree and shows Bree out the door. The women start wondering if Edie ever thought about her death. Gaby tells them she did and flashes back to a night out with Edie after divorcing Carlos. They go to a singles bar where they end up having a friendly competition of who can get the most swizzle sticks in one hour. After Gaby wins, Edie leaves her at the bar, so Gaby finds her sitting on the swings in the park. Edie tells Gaby that her youth is going fast and that she knew she would never make it to 50. A voice in her head tells her to live it up today because she won't get many tomorrows. Gaby reassures Edie that 50 years from now they will still get men to buy them drinks and be the hottest elderly women. Once they locate Travers' room, Lynette sits him down and tells him that his mother was in a serious accident and died. They are surprised when Travers tells them he is fine. They try to get him to take time off from school, but he tells them that Edie was never around and was a bad parent because she gave him up and abandoned him. Karen forcibly sits him down to tell a story of how Edie visited her on the anniversary of her son's death. Edie tells Karen that she knows what it is like to lose a child because she gave full custody to her ex-husband which angers Karen. Edie explains that for Travers to have a decent normal life, he needed to be away from her, but she still loves him. Just as they are about to leave, Travers thanks them for driving all that way to tell him and they almost forget to give him the ashes. Travers tells them to keep them because they were her best friends and would know the perfect place to scatter them. Karen figures out a way to do it when a wind blows her front door open. Each woman has a small container of her ashes and scatters them in places Edie knew. They scatter them on grass she once walked on, under trees that had once given her shade, over the roses that she loved and next to the fences she used to gossip over. The wind then takes the remainder of her ashes up into the air as the camera pans out over Wisteria Lane while Edie narrates, saying \\"And that is how Wisteria Lane became my final resting place. My ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on, beneath trees that had once given me shade, on top of roses I once admired, and beside fences I once gossiped over. And after my friends had finished saying goodbye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air. As I looked down on the world I began to let go of it. I let go of white picket fences, and cars and driveways, coffee cups and vacuum cleaners. I let go of all those things which seemed so ordinary, but when you put them together they make up a life, a life that really was one-of-a-kind. I’ll tell you something... it’s not hard to die when you know you have lived. And I did, oh, how I lived!\\" Notes * This title comes from the song 'The Ladies Who Lunch', from the 1970 Stephen Sondheim musical, Company.

Hayes, Jess G. (1954) Apache Vengeance: The true story of Apache Kid University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, page 181, The many versions of his Apache name include: Skibenanted, Oskabennantelz, Ohyessonna, Gjonteee, Zenogolache, Shisininty, and Eskibinadel. Clare Vernon McKanna: White Justice In Arizona: Apache Murder Trials In The Nineteenth Century, page 193 was born in Aravaipa Canyon (25 miles (40 kilometers) south of San Carlos Agency) into one of the three local groups of the Aravaipa/Arivaipa Apache Band (in Apache:Tsee Zhinnee - ″Dark Rocks People″) of San Carlos Apache, one subgroup of the Western Apache people. As a member of what the U.S. government called the \\"SI band\\", Kid developed important skills, became a famous and respected scout and later a notorious renegade active in the borderlands of the U.S. states of Arizona and New Mexico in the late 19th and possibly the early 20th centuries. His exact date of birth is unknown, but he is believed to have been born sometime in the 1860s. His year of death is generally given as 1894, but some New Mexico cattle ranchers claimed he was alive until the 1930s. The Apache Kid Wilderness in New Mexico is named after him.Julyan, Bob and Till, Tom (1998) New Mexico's Wilderness Areas: The Complete Guide Westcliffe Publishers, Englewood, Colorado, page 207, The Apache Kid character in Marvel Comics was also named after him but otherwise has no connection. Early history The Apache Kid (Haskay-bay-nay- ntayl, center) while he was a sergeant for the U.S. Army Haskay-bay-nay-ntayl was captured by Yuma Indians as a boy, and after being freed by the U.S. Army, he became a street orphan in army camps. As a teenager, in the mid-1870s, the Kid met and was essentially adopted by Al Sieber, the Chief of the Army Scouts. A few years later, in 1881, the Kid enlisted with the U.S. Cavalry as an Indian scout, in a program designed by General George Crook to help quell raids by hostile bands of Apache. By July 1882, owing to his remarkable abilities in the job, he was promoted to sergeant. Shortly thereafter he accompanied Crook on an expedition into the Sierra Madre Occidental. He worked on assignment both in Arizona and northern Mexico over the next couple of years, but in 1885 he was involved in a riot while intoxicated, and to prevent his being hanged by Mexican authorities, Sieber sent him back north. Sometimes he is also counted as White Mountain Apache, but it does not match his family background. He was the son (some sources say grandson) of Togodechuz/Togo-de- Chuz, chief of the so called \\"SI band\\" and he had very high prominence in that particular band. Kid married into another important family, becoming the son- in-law of the prominent \\"SL band\\" chief Eskiminzin (Hashkebansiziin - \\"Angry, Men Stand in Line for Him\\", 1828-1894), his wife was possibly Nahthledeztelth. Because Eskiminizin was also a band chief of another Aravaipa local group consequently, that gave him high status very early on. Arrests and trials The Apache Kid as a prisoner in Globe, Arizona In May 1887, Sieber and several army officers left the San Carlos post on business, and the Kid was left in charge of the scouts in their absence. The scouts decided to have a party, and brewed up what was called tiswin, a type of liquor. During the drinking, several became intoxicated, and an altercation between a scout named Gon- Zizzie (a member of a third Aravaipa band, the \\"SA band\\") and the Kid's father, Togo-de-Chuz, resulted in the Kid's father being killed. In turn, friends of the Kid killed Gon-Zizzie. The Kid also killed Gon-Zizzie's brother, Rip. On June 1, 1887, Sieber and Lt. John Pierce confronted the scouts involved in the altercations, and ordered them to disarm and comply with arrest until the incidents could be handled properly through investigation. The Kid and the others complied, but a shot was fired from a crowd that had gathered to watch the events. Several other shots were fired from the crowd, including one that hit Sieber in the ankle. During the confusion, the Apache Kid and several others fled. The army reacted swiftly, sending two troops of the 4th Cavalry in pursuit of the escapees. The Kid and his followers evaded the soldiers, while relying on assistance from sympathetic Apaches. The Kid contacted the army and explained that if the soldiers were recalled, he would surrender. They were, and he did, on June 25, 1887. The Kid and four others were court-martialed, found guilty of mutiny and desertion, and sentenced to death by firing squad. In August, the sentence was commuted to life in prison. General Nelson A. Miles intervened and further reduced the sentence to ten years in prison. The five prisoners were sent to Alcatraz, where they remained until their convictions were overturned in October 1888. They were freed, but in October 1889, Apaches in the area enraged by their release were able to force the issue of new warrants, and again the Kid was on the run. Again the Kid and the others were arrested, and again they were convicted, this time sentenced to seven years in prison. =Kelvin Grade massacre= The convicts were initially imprisoned in Globe, Arizona, but were soon arranged to be transported to Yuma Territorial Prison. During the prisoner transfer, on the morning of November 2, 1889, nine prisoners, including the Apache Kid, escaped by overpowering two guards, Sheriffs Glen Reynolds and William A. Holmes, and a stagecoach driver, Eugene Middleton. In what was later called the Kelvin Grade massacre, Reynolds was killed, with his pistol and watch stolen in the process, and Holmes, too, was killed;ODMP william Holmes Middleton was shot in the head but survived, and stated later that he would have been killed outright had the Kid not intervened and prevented his death. Middleton elaborated that he had offered the Apache Kid a cigarette, and this was why the Apache kid had left him alive. The prisoners escaped into the desert. Militias, bounty hunters, and U.S. Army soldiers cooperated over the following months in a manhunt for the escapees, all of whom were eventually recaptured except for the Apache Kid. Last years For years there were unconfirmed reports of sightings of the Apache Kid, but nothing ever came of any of them. Over the next several years, the Kid was accused of or linked to various crimes, including rape and murder, but there were never any solid links to him being involved in these or any crimes at all. For all practical purposes, he vanished. During an 1890 shootout between Apache renegades and Mexican soldiers, a warrior was killed and found to be in possession of Reynolds' watch and pistol.Hayes, Jess G. (1954) Apache Vengeance: The true story of Apache Kid University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, page 162, However, the warrior was said to have been much too old to be the Apache Kid. The last reported crimes allegedly committed by the Kid were in 1894. It was in that year in the San Mateo Mountains west of Socorro, New Mexico that Charles Anderson, a rancher, and his cowboys killed an Apache who had been rustling cattle and who was identified at the time as the Apache Kid. That identification is also contested.Oral History Tape 7 transcript: Ed Burris interviewed by Ellen Davis Socorro County Historical Society, Oral History Project, Socorro, New Mexico After that, the Apache Kid became something of a legend.Hayes, Jess G. (1954) Apache Vengeance: The true story of Apache Kid University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, New Mexico, page 155, In 1896, John Horton Slaughter claimed to have killed the Apache Kid in the mountains of Chihuahua. In 1899, Colonel Emilio Kosterlitzky, of the Mexican Rurales, reported that the Kid was alive and well and living among the Apache of the Sierra Madre Occidental. This was never confirmed. In his book, Cow Dust and Saddle Leather (1968), Ben Camp relates in detail his knowledge of the last days of the Apache Kid. Chapter 17 is entitled \\"The Apache Kid's Last Horse Wrangle\\". In it, the author describes the scene he witnessed as a 17-year-old, how Billy Keene, a member of the posse, actually had the head of the Apache Kid in Chloride, New Mexico in the year 1907. The chapter describes how, starting September 4, 1907, the posse split up and tracked down the Apache Kid in the San Mateo Mountains. Camp describes in detail events related by Billy Keene. He also relates how the watch belonged to a rancher named Saunders. Saunders was found dead and another man, Red Mills, was being held in connection with his murder. The gold-filled Elgin watch had been sent to a jeweler to be repaired. The jeweler who repaired it had written down the serial number and inscribed one of his own in the back of the case. The Apache Kid had apparently been known to be in the area of the Saunders ranch at the time of his demise. In addition, the book reports that an Apache woman was wounded in the shootout. The book continues to describe the events of her search for food. She was eventually captured at the Monica Tanks cabin fifty miles south of San Marcial. When questioned she confirmed that her husband was the Apache Kid and he had been killed at the head of the San Mateo Canyon. She was returned to the Mescalero Apache tribe. The tribe was informed of the situation and her two children were taken into the tribe. Legacy Cattle ranchers continued to report rustling well into the 1920s, often claiming it was the Apache Kid in the lead, but these claims also were never confirmed, and authorities eventually simply discounted any involvement by the Kid, long thought dead by either gunshot or sickness, as those rumors had filtered down also. Edgar Rice Burroughs, future creator of the Tarzan tales, was a member of the 7th U.S. Cavalry while they were \\"chasing\\" the Apache Kid in 1896 Arizona.Porges, Irwin (1975). - Edgar Rice Burroughs: The Man Who Created Tarzan. - Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press. - p.58. Today, one mile from Apache Kid Peak, high in the San Mateo Mountains of the Cibola National Forest, a marker stands as a grave, where the Anderson posse claimed to have killed the Kid in 1894. According to local residents, the body was not buried and the bones and shreds of his clothing lay scattered about the site for some years, with people taking some as souvenirs. Kenneth Alton played the Apache Kid in a 1955 episode of Stories of the Century.

PTCC is a member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, which comprises 31 state universities and community and technical colleges in Minnesota. History Established in 1965 as the 24th Minnesota area vocational-technical school with a focus on providing occupational, educational and technical expertise to students, the local Pine City School Board of Education worked closely with the Minnesota Department of Education from 1963 to 1965 to obtain necessary approvals needed to establish an area vocational-technical school in Pine City. During this period, Pine City and Mora were cities both considered as sites. The Department originally chose Mora as the site for the vocational- technical school; however, after a visit to the Pine City public schools by the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Education, Pine City was designated as the site for the new area vocational-technical school. Originally housed in various locations throughout Pine City, the college's main building was not built until 1966. The first programs offered at Pine City Area Vocational-Technical School in 1966 were in four program areas that offered occupational diplomas in auto mechanics, welding, drafting and secretarial/business. Students did not pay tuition to attend the vocational- technical school. In 1989, the college opened the Employment and Training Center, which manages a variety of childcare, training and support programs for the five counties serving East Central Minnesota. In 1994, the college sought and received accreditation through the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, and in 1996, the college was established as a state technical college. Today, Pine Technical College retains its NCACS accreditation, is a member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, serves more than 1,000 students and offers programs/degrees in a variety of career fields.

Today, it follows the mainstream public education system and offers the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ Levels. It also uses a full English curriculum, except for foreign or mother tongue languages. Initially, it was known as Yock Eng School (). In 1947, it was renamed to Yock Eng High School (). Finally, in 1985, its name is changed to Yuying Secondary (). It was previously located at the present CDAC premise and moved to the current site at Hougang in 1986. History1910–1940= On 15 March 1910, Yock Eng School, a Chinese primary school, was founded by 7 Hainanese community leaders. At that time, it was located at Prinsep Street () The school began with an enrolment of 15 pupils. However, it soon outgrew her premises as enrolment continued to climb. In 1939, the School Management Board initiated a campaign to raise funds for new premises. =1941–1985= In 1941, the school moved to a new campus at 65 Tanjong Katong Road. The two-storey building was given conservation status by Urban Redevelopment Authority on 8 April 2005. The school programme was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. During the War, the school premises were occupied by the Japanese armed forces and was used as Japanese Military Police HQ. The school reopened her doors to pupils in July 1946 with an enrolment of 600. The post-war years were a period of rapid growth for the school in terms of enrolment and recognition. In 1958, enrolment stood at a peak of 2400 pupils. In 1954, some students were involved in the Malayan Emergency. During the 1960s and 70s, there was a shift towards English medium education vis a vis Chinese medium education. Thus, the school admitted its first batch of English stream pupils in 1981. In 1988, the last batch of Chinese stream pupils graduated. The government planned to acquire the land on which the school stood at Tanjong Katong Road. To relocate the school, the new school building was being in Hougang New Town at the cost of approximately $10 million. The government would share 50% of the cost. In 1984, the board of management of Yock Eng High School faced the dilemma of raising the remaining $5 million. If it could not raise sufficient funds, the board would have to turn over the management of the school to the Education Ministry and the school would be converted to a government school. =1985–present= On 9 December 1985, the school was relocated to her present premises at 47 Hougang Avenue 1. The school was renamed Yuying Secondary School and was officially opened on 13 August 1987. Today, Yuying continues as a Government-Aided secondary school. It is a single session school with an enrolment of 1060 pupils and 90 teachers. The school also serves the surrounding Hougang community as a CDAC Tuition Centre in the evenings and on Saturdays. Several teachers are serving in this centre.

Prior to leaving Necrophobic he had, however, written most of the material for the next album. The album Darkside, with Parland's material intact, was released by Necrophobic in 1997, although Parland himself did not participate as a musician on the album. Parland also ran the independent record label Hellspawn Records (also Hellspawn Studio)Garry Sharpe-Young, Sylvia Rochonnat, Anthologie du métal : Tome 2, Camion Blanc, 2012, \\"Marduk.\\" from 1994 to 2002 in Johanneshov, Stockholm, releasing albums from bands such as Abruptum and his own Dark Funeral, with distribution by House of Kicks, VME and Sound Pollution. After leaving Dark Funeral in 1996, Parland founded the bands War and Infernal. While having kept a low profile and not being actively involved in any bands since the second line-up of Infernal broke up in 2003, Parland announced in January 2009 that he was working on new material with drummer Tomas Asklund (Gorgoroth, Dissection, ex- Dark Funeral). Demos and a full-length album were to be recorded during 2009. An EP from the band was finally released on May 1, 2010, entitled \\"The Infernal Return\\". In an interview from October, 2012, David Parland explained the reasons why Infernal went inactive right after the new EP, which included bad financial circumstances, Parland getting arrested, and being sent to a psychiatric district for \\"detoxification purposes\\". According to the interview, Parland got a neck injury in a car crash several years before and only resorted to using painkillers. He eventually became addicted. Also, Parland revealed that Infernal had parted ways for good with drummer Tomas Asklund. Parland was planning on searching for a pro black/death/heavy metal drummer for the recording of the long planned and long-awaited full-length The Infernal Retribution. The album was intended to be released in late 2013 according to this interview. Infernal never recorded the long-awaited full- length album and was ultimately terminated. On March 19, 2013, at the age of 42, David Parland died by suicide. In reaction to the news of Parland's death, former bandmate Lord Ahriman said, \\"During the last couple of weeks, I was in close contact with David. He was going through an extremely difficult time of life, whereof he contacted me to ask for my help. Even though the two of us had a bit of a complicated relationship over the years (much excessive in the media though), he knew that he could ALWAYS call or visit me when needed, which he also did once in a while. Last time I talked to him was when he called me on March 15. From what I could understand, things were going in the right direction... What happened after that I simply can't understand... I cant understand WHY he didn't call me [again.]\\" Beliefs He was a self- described misanthrope and harbored contempt for organized religion and \\"political correctness\\", as well as \\"slave mentality\\" and other mindsets which oppose individualism. He agreed with many aspects of Satanic thought, but did not consider himself religious.

The hospital is managed by NHS Grampian. History Wood engraving by W.E. Hodgkin, 1862 Chalmers Hospital was founded by Alexander Chalmers (died 11 August 1835), a merchant of Banff, who left the whole of his estate to be applied, upon the death of his wife, towards funding and building a hospital for the people in the Royal Burgh of Banff. Mrs Chalmers died in 1861, and Chalmers Hospital opened on 19 July 1864. The original 'deed of mortification' set out that this was for any destitute sick persons born, domiciled or resident in the Banff area, although in 1929 the trustees successfully petitioned for the removal of this restriction. Some major redevelopment work began in October 2008, after the hospital attracted criticism for not being up to date, with some of the interior features having been there since the Second World War. The hospital remained open during the work, although the Findlater ward services were moved to Campbell Hospital in Portsoy until the Findlater ward was refurbished, and Seafield and Deveron ward were merged. The midwifery unit was demolished and rebuilt to provide modern facilities. Numerous other internal changes were also made inside, including X-ray facilities being moved to a different area of the building. The redevelopment also provided upgraded facilities for physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and podiatry. The completion of the redevelopment was recognised with a visit by the Princess Royal in March 2012. Services The hospital is supported by GPs from Banff, Gamrie, Deveron, Macduff, Portsoy and Aberchirder Medical Practices. It has a 24-hour Minor injuries unit.

The protagonist struggles to travel across a world filled with cannibals and other dangers. * David Brin's novel The Postman (1985) is set in a time after a massive plague and political fracture result in a complete collapse of society. It unflatteringly portrays survivalists as one of the causes of the collapse, and so the quasi-survivalist \\"Holnist\\" characters are despised by the remaining population. The Holnists follow a totalitarian social theory idolizing the powerful who enforce their perceived right to oppress the weak. However, Brin later stated that when he was writing the book, survivalist was the best term to describe the militia movement. * Ernest Callenbach's novel Ecotopia (1975), about the secession of the Pacific Northwest from the United States to form a new country based on environmentalism, named the political party governing the new country the Survivalist Party. However, in his sequel, Ecotopia Emerging (1981), he qualified that choice of name by having the party leader state that the term \\"Survivalist\\" referred to the survival of the planet's ecosystems, rather than to people who prepare for an economic or political collapse. * Gordon R. Dickson's novel Wolf and Iron (1993) details the journey of a single man attempting to cross 2000 miles of hostile territory.

The novel won a Hugo Awardin 1968. * Robert A. Heinlein uses survivalism as a theme in much of his science fiction. For example, Tunnel in the Sky (1955) explores issues of survivalism and social interactions in an unfamiliar environment, and Farnham's Freehold (1964) begins as a story of survivalism in a nuclear war. Heinlein also wrote essays such as How to be a Survivor, which provide advice on preparing for and surviving a nuclear war. * Stephen King's post- apocalyptic novel The Stand (1978) is set after a biological weapon pandemic. The surviving few slowly gather together only to realise that they are not alone. * James Howard Kunstler's novel World Made By Hand (2008) is a \\"cozy catastrophe\\" set in upstate New York, in the near future, after the American economy has collapsed as a result of the combined impact of peak oil, global warming, an influenza pandemic, and nuclear terrorism.

The book was adapted into a 1981 film directed by Christian de Chalonge and starring Michel Serrault, Jacques Dutronc, Jacques Villeret, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. . * Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven's novel Lucifer's Hammer (1977) is about a cataclysmic comet hitting the Earth, and various groups of people struggling to survive the aftermath in southern California. Lucifer’s Hammer has contributed significantly to the survivalist movement, as we understand it today. One reviewer noted: \\"A comet’s impact with the Earth creates an extremely bad, worst-case “fast crash” scenario. ...In this novel, people begin feeding on one another, literally, within a month of the event.\\"\\" *Pournelle and Niven's similarly themed \\"Footfall\\" (1985) is about aliens bombarding Earth using controlled meteorite strikes to exterminate life. * Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged (1957) describes a group of highly creative people who withdraw from society into a hidden mountain valley while civilization totally collapses, whereupon they emerge to rebuild it. This book differs from others in the genre in that the protagonists' withdrawal directly causes the collapse, since it was they who sustained civilization. * James Wesley Rawles's book Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse (2009) is the first of a five-book novel series about a full-scale socio-economic collapse and subsequent invasion of the United States.

Stirling.'s alternate history, post-apocalyptic book Dies the Fire (2004) is the first in The Emberverse series. The story takes shape in a universe where electricity, guns, explosives, internal combustion engines, and steam power no longer work. The sequels flesh out the storyline in a survivalist post-Change world of agriculture, clan-based life, and conflict. * H.G. Wells, who pioneered many subgenres of modern science fiction, contributed to this one as well. The later parts of his novel The War in the Air (1908) depict the collapse of modern civilization due to the massive use of weapons of mass destruction and the systematic destruction of cities, the grim struggle of the isolated few survivors, and the reversion of the world to semi-Medieval conditions - in all this anticipating recurring themes of later works. * Philip Wylie's novel Tomorrow (1954) is the story of two American cities weathering a nuclear attack. One was prepared with an extensive civil defense plan, while the other was not. * John Wyndham's novel The Day of the Triffids (1951) is the story of the survival of a small group of people in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by carnivorous plants, where most of the population is afflicted by blindness.

It contains detailed plans for the average citizen to survive zombie uprisings of varying intensity and reach, and describes \\"cases\\" of zombie outbreaks in history, including an interpretation of Roanoke Colony. Survivalism and disaster preparation are also prevalent themes in Brooks' second novel, World War Z (2006). Brooks interest in the subject was sparked circa age 10, when he saw his very first zombie movie, Revenge of the Zombies (1943). * Ben Elton's dystopia novel This Other Eden is a satirical environmentalist science fiction book set in the future, when Earth is devastated by systematic pollution and environmental disasters that seem intentional, as news of them is immediately broadcast from faraway sites in the presence of a terrorist pressure group of environmentalists. This is followed by a huge TV advertising campaign for self-contained survival environments manufactured, as the positive main character finds out, by a company controlled by both the egomaniacal TV network owner and the equally hideous sponsor of eco-terrorism, both of whom in the end are punished cruelly for their dastardly deeds. Earth eventually restores itself after its eco-Doomsday. * Weir's science fiction novel The Martian follows an American astronaut, Mark Watney, as he becomes stranded alone on Mars and must improvise in order to survive.

The town usually must fight an outside enemy in order to preserve their food and supplies. Jericho, as well as other media fiction (as Oddworld) also focuses on scavenging. * Lost, a group of crash survivors are stranded on an island with little food and only the remains of the aircraft and baggage to survive with. Over the course of the series, the survivors adapt to life on the jungle isle while some even welcome it.

In 2008 and 2009 the BBC aired a new updated Survivors series, which was more hard-edged than the original, but still showed the protagonist \\"Abby Grant\\" and her ad hoc survival group as reluctant to arm themselves, even after being confronted by armed adversaries on numerous occasions. In Episode 6 (which aired on Dec. 29, 2008) Abby's group is forced to abandon their quasi- retreat—a country estate—following a confrontation and kidnapping by a provisional government. * Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008) is a science fiction show involving time travel with lead characters that take survivalist steps to prepare for, or possibly prevent, a future nuclear war. * Sheldon Cooper, a character in The Big Bang Theory is a paranoid survivalist, he keeps at least two survival kits in his bedroom and has planned emergency escape routes from each room in the house.

By October 1943, the 74th was the only Sixth Air Force tactical unit still operating from Guatemala City Airport and, the following month, ended its association with the 6th Bombardment Group, when that organization was disbanded. It subsequently fell directly under VI Bomber Command. The period between April and August, the unit moved again to the remote Seymour Island AAF on the Galapagos Islands. The move accomplished, the unit engaged in patrols over the eastern Pacific. The unit returned to Aguadulce Field, Panama, on 13 February 1945 after only some seven months. In May. the Squadron moved to Rio Hato Field, remaining until the end of the war, being inactivated on 1 November 1946. =Korean War= The squadron was reactivated as the 135th Bombardment Squadron on 27 March 1951. It operated B-29 Superfortresses as part of the Federalized 106th Bombardment Group, New York Air National Guard that was elevated to active duty at March Air Force Base, California during the Korean War. The 135th Bomb Squadron continued operations under SAC's Fifteenth Air Force until it was inactivated, with personnel and equipment being assigned to the 320th Bombardment Wing when the guardsmen were relieved from active duty on 1 December 1952.

The case against P. Furius Decianus attempted to prosecute Publius Furius (tribune in 100 or 99 BC), but according to Cicero,Cicero, Pro Rabirio Perduellionis Reo 24–25; see also Valerius Maximus 8.1. lost the case because he expressed sorrow over the killing of the radical tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus.T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic, vol. 2, 99 B.C.–31 B.C. (New York: American Philological Association, 1952), pp. 4–5, 532. Decianus's commitment to popularist politics is well-established and consistent. His father was the Publius Decius (praetor 115 BC) who prosecuted Lucius Opimius for the murder of the popularist leader Gaius Gracchus. The formation of the name Appuleius Decianus indicates that he was adopted by a member of the gens Appuleia and perhaps even by Saturninus himself.For further discussion of the parentage and adoption of Decianus, see E. Badian, \\"P. Decius P.f. Subulo: An Orator of the Time of the Gracchi,\\" Journal of Roman Studies 46 (1956) 91–96, especially p. 95. \\"Tumultuous efforts\\" were made during the tribunate of Decianus to avenge the deaths of Saturninus and Servilius Glaucia.Erich S. Gruen, \\"Political Prosecutions in the 90's BC,\\" Historia 15 (1966), pp. 34–35. The trial of Furius was politically motivated; no actual charge is even recorded, but may have been ambitus (election irregularities). Furius had originally supported Saturninus, but ultimately broke with him as did the majority of the tax-collecting equestrian order who rejected his plebs-friendly policies. Growing opposition to Saturninus had compelled Gaius Marius to renounce him, resulting in his proscription and death. Furius had proposed a number of post-mortem penalties, such as the confiscation of his property, the destruction of his house, and the rescinding of some of his legislation.Harriet I. Flower, The Art of Forgetting: Disgrace and Oblivion in Roman Political Culture (University of North Caroline Press, 2006), p. 83 online. The social conflicts that culminated in Saturninus's death continued to play out in the law courts during the 90s. Decianus brought the case against Furius in retaliation, and chose to present it for the judgment of the people (iudicium populi) rather than in the court for which equites acted as judges.Gruen, \\"Political Prosecutions,\\" p. 32 and p. 36, note 33. Furius was acquitted. Appian saysAppian, Bellum civile 1.33, Bill Thayer's edition at LacusCurtius online. that C. Canuleius was the tribune who prosecuted Furius; this may be a textual error, an additional prosecutor, or a reference to a second trial. A mob, however, took their own revenge on Furius, attacking him and tearing his body to pieces.David F. Epstein, Personal Enmity in Roman Politics, 218-43 B.C. (Croom Helm, 1987), p. 79 online. The case against L. Valerius Flaccus Decianus also prosecuted Lucius Valerius Flaccus (suffect consul 86 BC), who had just completed his term as curule aedile in 99 BC. Revenge again may be a factor, but less clearly so. Lucius's older cousin of the same name had been consular colleague in 100 BC when Marius turned against Saturninus. During the 90s and into the mid-80s, the Valerii Flacci tended to be moderate in their political tactics while supporting the popularist Marian-Cinnan faction. Decianus appears to have been unsuccessful in this prosecution as well; Flaccus's career shows no signs of having been hampered.Michael Charles Alexander, The Case for the Prosecution in the Ciceronian Era (University of Michigan Press, 2002), p. 80 online. Tried and convicted The political ineffectuality of Decianus was underscored when he himself was brought to trial after his term ended. The charges remain unspecified in the historical record, but he is most likely to have been brought before the new maiestas tribunal for which members of the equestrian order served as judges.Gruen, \\"Political Prosecutions,\\" pp. 36 and 63. The Bobbio Scholiast notesBobbio Scholiast 94 (Stangl). that Decianus was condemned for his \\"seditious and tumultuous tribunate,\\" to which may be compared similar remarks by Cicero on Sextus Titius, a tribune the same year as Furius.Gruen, \\"Political Prosecutions,\\" p. 38, note 38. Decianus's sorrow at the death of Saturninus was used against him, as was the possession by Titius of a bust of the demagogue; these signs of attachment to a public enemy even after his death were construed as treasonous.Harriet I. Flower, The Art of Forgetting (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), p. 84. After his trial, Decianus fled to AsiaCicero, Pro Flacco 77. and sought refuge with Mithridates VI of Pontus prior to the First Mithridatic War. Although exile and flight was the customary response to condemnation, Decianus took the unusual measure of bringing his young son with him, indicating that he had no intention of trying to regain his place in Roman society.Gordon P. Kelly, A History of Exile in the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 88–89 online.  Gaius Appuleius C. f. Decianus Decianus' son, who had the same name, lived in Apollonis but retained his Roman citizenship.Gordon, A History of Exile, p. 136. Cicero accuses both Deciani of participating in depredations against the free civitas of Apollonis with Mithridates.Cicero, Pro Flacco 71. This younger Decianus served as an advisor to the L. Valerius Flaccus who governed Asia in 62 BC, but he was later one of the prosecutors in the case against FlaccusSee also Decimus Laelius. that is the subject of Cicero's defense speech Pro Flacco.

ContentBackground= According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, \\"The forgiveness of sin and restoration of communion with God entail the remission of the eternal punishment of sin, but temporal punishment of sin remains.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church §1472 Paul VI explained that sin brings punishments inflicted by God's sanctity and justice, which must be expiated either here on earth or else in the life to come. \\"These punishments are imposed by the just and merciful judgment of God for the purification of souls, the defense of the sanctity of the moral order and the restoration of the glory of God to its full majesty.\\" Such expiation generally takes the form of penance, traditionally described as prayers, fasting, and alms, but also includes works of mercy and charity. > \\"That punishment or the vestiges of sin may remain to be expiated or > cleansed and that they in fact frequently do even after the remission of > guilt is clearly demonstrated by the doctrine on purgatory. In purgatory, in > fact, the souls of those 'who died in the charity of God and truly > repentant, but before satisfying with worthy fruits of penance for sins > committed and for omissions' are cleansed after death with purgatorial > punishments\\". The document stressed that the Church's aim was not merely to help the faithful make due satisfaction for their sins, but chiefly to bring them to greater fervour of charity. For this purpose, Paul VI decreed that partial indulgences, previously granted as the equivalent of a certain number of days, months, quarantines,Maas, Anthony. \\"Quarantines.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 1 November 2016 or years of canonical penance, simply supplement, and to the same degree, the remission that those performing the indulgenced action already gain by the charity and contrition with which they do it.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article indulgences \\"For all men who walk this earth daily commit at least venial sins; thus all need the mercy of God to be set free from the penal consequences of sin.\\" The abolition of the classification by years and days made it clearer than before that repentance and faith are required not only for remission of eternal punishment for mortal sin but also for any remission of temporal punishment for sin. \\"Indulgences cannot be gained without a sincere conversion of outlook and unity with God\\".Indulgentiarum doctrina, art. 11 =Indulgences= An indulgence is the remission before God of the temporal punishment due sins already forgiven as far as their guilt is concerned. \\"The aim pursued by ecclesiastical authority in granting indulgences is not only that of helping the faithful to expiate the punishment due to sin but also that of urging them to perform works of piety, penitence and charity—particularly those which lead to growth in faith and which favor the common good.\\" An indulgence is partial or plenary accordingly, as it removes either part or all of the temporal punishment due sin. Indulgences can always be applied to the dead by way of suffrage. Enchiridion Indulgentiarum The apostolic constitution ordered a revision of the official list of indulgenced prayers and good works, which had been called the Raccolta, \\"with a view to attaching indulgences only to the most important prayers and works of piety, charity and penance\\".Indulgentiarum Doctrina, norm 13 This removed from the list of indulgenced prayers and good works, now called the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum,Enchiridion Indulgentiarum many prayers for which various religious institutes, confraternities and similar groups had succeeded in the course of centuries in obtaining grants of indulgences, but which could not be classified as among \\"the most important\\". Religious institutes and the like, to which grants of plenary indulgences, for instance for visiting a particular church or shrine, had been previously made, were given a year from the date of promulgation of Indulgentiarum Doctrina to have them confirmed, and any that were not confirmed (mostly in a more limited way than before)Indulgentiarum Doctrina, norms 14 and 15 within two years became null and void.Indulgentiarum Doctrina, Transitional Norms The Enchiridion Indulgentiarum reached its fourth edition in Latin in 1999,[Enchiridon Indulgentiarum. Normae et Concessiones (editio quarta, Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2009 ) and is available on the Holy See's website.Enchiridion indulgentiarum An English translation of the second edition (when the general grants were three, not four) is available online. The Enchiridion Indulgentiarum differs from the Raccolta in that it lists \\"only the most important prayers and works of piety, charity and penance\\". On the other hand, it includes new general grants of partial indulgences that apply to a wide range of prayerful actions, and it indicates that the prayers that it does list as deserving veneration on account of divine inspiration or antiquity or as being in widespread use are only examplesEnchiridion Indulgentiarum, Aliae Concessiones, Proœmium, 2 of those to which the first these general grants applies: \\"Raising the mind to God with humble trust while performing one's duties and bearing life's difficulties, and adding, at least mentally, some pious invocation\\".Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Concessiones, I In this way, the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, in spite of its smaller size, classifies as indulgenced an immensely greater number of prayers than were treated as such in the Raccolta. Actions for which indulgences are granted Archbishop Socrates B. Villegas bestows the Easter Mass Plenary Indulgence in 2012, St John the Evangelist Metropolitan Cathedral, Dagupan City. There are four general grants of indulgence, which are meant to encourage the faithful to infuse a Christian spirit into the actions of their daily lives and to strive for perfection of charity. These indulgences are partial, and their worth therefore depends on the fervour with which the person performs the recommended actions: # Raising the mind to God with humble trust while performing one's duties and bearing life's difficulties, and adding, at least mentally, some pious invocation. # Devoting oneself or one's goods compassionately in a spirit of faith to the service of one's brothers and sisters in need. # Freely abstaining in a spirit of penance from something licit and pleasant. # Freely giving open witness to one's faith before others in particular circumstances of everyday life.Normae de Indulgentiis, Quattuor Concessiones Generaliores Among the particular grants, which, on closer inspection, will be seen to be included in one or more of the four general grants, especially the first, the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum draws special attentionAliae Concessiones, Proœmium, 7 to four activities for which a plenary indulgence can be gained on any day, though only once a day: # Piously reading or listening to Sacred Scripture for at least half an hour.Concessiones 30 # Adoration of Jesus in the Eucharist for at least half an hour.Concessiones 7 §1, 1º # The pious exercise of the Stations of the Cross.Concessiones 13, 2º # Recitation of the Rosary or the Akathist in a church or oratory, or in a family, a religious community, an association of the faithful and, in general, when several people come together for an honourable purpose.Concessiones 17 §1, 1º and 23 §1 A plenary indulgence may also be gained on some occasions, which are not everyday occurrences. They include: * Receiving, even by radio or television, the blessing given by the Pope Urbi et Orbi (to the city of Rome and to the world) or that which a bishop is authorized to give three times a year to the faithful of his diocese.Concessiones 4 * Taking part devoutly in the celebration of a day devoted on a world level to a particular religious purpose.Concessiones 5 Under this heading come the annual celebrations such as the World Day of Prayer for Vocations, and occasional celebrations such as World Youth Day.World Youth Day Archives *Taking part for at least three full days in a spiritual retreat.Concessiones 10 *Taking part in some functions during the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity including its conclusion.Concessiones 11 The prayers specifically mentioned in the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum are not of the Latin Rite tradition alone, but also from the traditions of the Eastern Catholic Churches, such as the Akathistos, Paraklesis, Evening Prayer, and Prayer for the Faithful Departed (Byzantine), Prayer of Thanksgiving (Armenian), Prayer of the Shrine and the Lakhu Mara (Chaldean), Prayer of Incense and Prayer to Glorify Mary the Mother of God (Coptic), Prayer for the Remission of Sins and Prayer to Follow Christ (Ethiopian), Prayer for the Church, and Prayer of Leave-taking from the Altar (Maronite), and Intercessions for the Faithful Departed (Syrian). Apart from the recurrences listed in the Enchiridion, special indulgences are granted on occasions of special spiritual significance such as a jubilee yearThe Great Jubilee Indulgence or the centenary or similar anniversary of an event such as the apparition of Our Lady of LourdesGrant of indulgence on the occasion of the 150th apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Lourdes or the celebration of a World Youth Day. For those who are properly disposed, an indulgence, though none is normally authorized or indicated in these cases, can still be granted (if the Bishop or Ordinary has specifically authorized it, and has also gotten prior approval from the Apostolic Penitentiary beforehand) for a priest's first blessing to individuals after his Ordination Mass. Again, though some Bishops have not endorsed this particular practice, and with their and the Penitentiary's approval, a newly ordained Deacon can bless people following his Ordination Mass, with a partial indulgence (however, a Deacon, even if some indulgence is authorized, may still give only those blessings which are authorized to him in the Long or Short Book of Blessings or the Rituale Romanum). A specific plenary indulgence is normally authorized to those properly disposed who attend a newly ordained priest's First Mass (which will usually be a Mass of Thanksgiving). This is not the same as any indulgence granted, if any, from attending the Ordination Mass itself, since he only concelebrates that Mass, with the ordaining Bishop being the principal celebrant. Further, this only applies to his First Mass, and not to any subsequent Masses of Thanksgiving he offers afterwards, or to his first Mass at his first assignment. Of particular significance is the plenary indulgence attached to the Apostolic Blessing that a priest is to impart when giving the sacraments to a person in danger of death, and which, if no priest is available, the Church grants to any rightly disposed Christian at the moment of death, on condition that that person was accustomed to say some prayers during life. In this case the Church itself makes up for the three conditions normally required for a plenary indulgence: sacramental confession, Eucharistic communion, and prayer for the Pope's intentions.Concessiones 12 References Category:Catholic penitential practices Category:20th-century papal bulls Category:Apostolic constitutions of Pope Paul VI Category:January 1967 events Category:1967 documents Category:1967 in Christianity Category:Sacramental law ","title":"Indulgentiarum Doctrina"},{"id":"21790348","text":"CMA CGM Vela is a container ship operated by CMA CGM.

Celery mosaic virus (CeMV) is a plant pathogenic virus in the genus Potyvirus and the virus family Potyviridae . In California (USA), mosaic diseases of celery (Apium graveolens) were reported as early as 1922.Poole, R.F. 1922. Celery mosaic. Phytopthology 12:151-154. After some time, it became clear that there were at least two different viruses causing mosaic diseases with similar symptoms in celery. These two viruses were first differentiated by host range. One of the viruses had a wide host range and was named Southern celery mosaic. The second had a host range restricted to the family Umbelliferae (Apiaceae) and was called Western celery mosaic. Continued research showed that the Southern mosaic virus was actually an isolate of Cucumber mosaic virus and Western celery mosaic eventually became known simply as Celery mosaic virus. Symptoms and host range Symptoms of celery mosaic virus include a distinct mottled pattern on the leaves, distorted leaf growth with exaggerated rosette formation. Some strains of celery mosaic virus cause a \\"crinkled\\" pattern to form on the leaves of the plant. Oftentimes, plants infected with celery mosaic virus early in their development do not produce usable crops. Plants infected by the virus late in their development may provide usable crops provided that the crops are harvested quickly after infection. Celery is the most common host of this virus. As the name implies, this virus causes a mosaic or mottling in the leaves of celery. There can also be malformation of leaflets. In older leaves, chorotic/necrotic spots may occur and the plants can be stunted. In addition to celery, this virus has been identified in other important crops in the Apiaceae including carrots (Daucus carota), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and dill (Anethum graveolens). It has also been identified in several weed species in the family Apiaceae, including poison hemlock (Conium maculatum),Sutabutra, T. and Campbell, R.N. 1971. Pl. Dis. Reptr. 55:328-332. mock bishopweed (Ptilimnium capillaceum) and wild cherry (Apium leptophyllum). There is some confusion in the literature as to whether CeMV can infect hosts in the family Chenopodiaceae. In 2002, a paper reporting the results of a survey in Australia found three different but related potyviruses infecting species of the Apiaceae in Australia, CeMV, Carrot virus Y (CarVY), and Apium virus Y (ApVY).Moran J. et al. 2002. Arch. Virol. 147:1855-1867. Both CarVYLatham, L.J. and Jones R.A. 2004. Virus Research 100 :89-99. and ApVY have been shown to infect one or more species of Chenopodium. The latter reference, reporting ApVY infecting celery in New Zealand, found the plants to be doubly infected with CeMV and ApVY and the authors suggested that CeMV “may mask the presence of ApVY”. It is possible that one or both of these viruses have been undetected in mixed infections with CeMV in some of the past studies. With sequence data now available for both CarVY and ApVY this ambiguity may be cleared up in time. Geographic distribution The geographic distribution of this virus is probably worldwide. In North America, besides California (USA), it has been reported in Florida Purcifull, D.E. and Shepard, J.F. 1967. Pl. Dis. Reptr. 51:502-505. and in Ontario, Canada.Kemp, W.G. and Frowd, J.A.

Transmission and disease management Celery mosaic, like most potyviruses, is non-persistently transmitted by aphids. This means that the aphid can pick up the virus on its stylet (its mouthparts) and transfer it quickly to the next plant it probes. The virus can also be transmitted mechanically by tools and machinery. At least 26 different aphid species are known to transmit the virus. There is no evidence of seed transmission. Because chemicals are not effective in treating plant viruses, management of celery mosaic virus focuses on reducing aphid population within colonies of plants.http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/r104100711.html Recommendations for management of celery mosaic virus include planting resistant cultivars, spreading out crops, clearing weeds from crop fields, and treating crops with pesticides. Because celery mosaic virus also affects umbelliferous plants, removal of umbelliferous weeds, like wild celery and wild parsnip, helps to control aphid populations. Celery grown in fields that have been host free for 2–3 months show greatly reduced risk of exposure to CeMV.http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/r104100711.html#REFERENCE Many studies have shown reduced virus outbreaks and severity in fields treated with reflective mulch which can provide unappealing visual stimuli to infected aphids. Fields treated with this mulch experience reduced infection rates. Genome The complete genome of Celery Mosaic Virus was sequenced in 2011. It was found to be 9999 nucleotides in length, encoding for 3181 amino acids in a single large open reading frame, and sharing between 39 and 72% of its sequence identity with other members of the genus Potyvirus, and is most closely related to Apium virus Y. Together, CeMV, Apium virus Y, and Panax virus Y form a distinct clade.

History and symbolism The Little Man first appears in A Brief History (1956), an animation film telling the story of the Universe and humankind from an evolutionary perspective. The trepidations caused by a dinosaur made a monkey fall off a tree and break its tail. The monkey then got off the ground under the appearance of The Little Man, who is then shown climbing a ladder. As he climbs, he successively turns into an Egyptian, a Greek, a Roman, a medieval knight, a Victorian gentleman, and a modern man. The Little Man explores the deep seas and then flies to space in a rocket (anticipating Yuri Gagarin's spaceflight by five years). The worldwide success achieved by A Brief History turned The Little Man into an iconic character, symbolizing the human race in its quest for knowledge and beauty. Ion Popescu- Gopo was going to use it in another seven films. In many situations, The Little Man is shown holding a flower to his heart, which is taken to symbolize the humans' capacity and need for love.

He was known for his participation in various campaigns against regional warlords during the reigns of Emperor Xianzong and Emperor Muzong.  Background  Adie Guangyan was born in 761, during the reign of Emperor Suzong. He had at least one older brother, Adie Guangjin (), and one older sister, who was older than Adie Guangjin. Their father Adie Liangchen () had been a hereditary prefect of Jitian Prefecture ()Old Book of Tang, vol. 161. — one of the prefectures that Tang established for the settlement of Huigu-related tribes that submitted to Tang during the reign of Emperor Taizong in the Hequ (河曲, i.e., the Ordos Desert region).New Book of Tang, vol. 43, part 2New Book of Tang, vol. 171. — and his Adie tribal army was part of the army of Shuofang Circuit (朔方, headquartered in modern Yinchuan, Ningxia). Adie Guangyan's older sister married an army officer named Sheli Gezhan (). In 764, when the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shuofang, Pugu Huai'en, was in rebellion against Emperor Suzong's son Emperor Daizong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. Sheli participated in the killing of Pugu's son Pugu Yang () and subsequently submitted to the imperial general Xin Yunjing (), the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). As the Adie brothers were dependent on their brother-in-law, they also settled their household at Hedong's capital Taiyuan. Both Adie Guangjin and Adie Guangyan learned riding and archery skills from Sheli. It was said that while Adie Guangjin was brave and resolute, his fighting abilities and strategies were not as good as Sheli's, but that Sheli was particularly complimentary of Adie Guangyan, whose abilities he considered superior to his own. By this point, Adie Guangjin was already known for his battlefield accomplishment while serving under Guo Ziyi, and by 765 was already created a prince. In 769, when the Adie brothers' mother died, it was said that there were 44 commemorative banners sent by generals and chancellors to mourn her and that she was buried in an extravagant ceremony. It was said that the Adie brothers were known for their love of family members. Adie Guangyan had already been married before his mother's death, and his mother entrusted the affairs of the household to Adie Guangyan's wife. When his mother died, Adie Guangyan, during the three years of mourning observance for her, was said to not return to his bedchambers for those three years — i.e., did not have sexual relations. After the mourning period, Adie Guangjin, who had previously not been married, married. Adie Guangyan had his wife send the household books to Adie Guangjin's wife — to let her take authority over the household, as the wife of the older brother. Adie Guangjin had the books returned to Adie Guangyan's wife and told Adie Guangyan, \\"Your wife served our mother, and it was our mother who put her in charge of the household. This cannot be changed.\\" The brothers embraced each other and wept. Adie Guangyan participated in the campaign against Li Huaiguang and had accomplishments during the campaign. His then-commander, the military governor Ma Sui, was impressed by his appearance, and gave Adie Guangyan his own sword.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Before the campaign against Wu Yuanji = In 806, during the reign of Emperor Dezong's grandson Emperor Xianzong, Yang Huilin () seized control of Xiasui Circuit (夏綏, headquartered in modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and Emperor Xianzong mobilized the armies of Hedong and Tiande Base (天德軍, in modern Bayan Nur, Inner Mongolia) to attack Yang. Yan Shou () the military governor of Hedong sent Adie Guangjin and Adie Guangyan to attack Yang. Soon, Yang's subordinate Zhang Chengjin () killed Yang and surrendered.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. In the fall, Adie Guangyan was ordered to rendezvous with the army commanded by the general Gao Chongwen in attacking the rebel warlord Liu Pi, who had seized control of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Adie Guangyan was late for the rendezvous by one day, and feared punishment. He thus advanced behind Liu's lines at Lutou Pass (鹿頭關, in modern Deyang, Sichuan) and cut off Lutou Pass's supply route and led to its surrender to Gao. It was said that Adie Guangyan became famous due to this battle, and he was later successively made the prefect of Dai (代州, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi) and Ming Prefecture (洺州, in modern Handan, Hebei). In 811, Emperor Xianzong bestowed the imperial surname of Li on Adie Guangjin, then the military governor of Zhenwu Circuit (振武, headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia) — and therefore, the Adie brothers were renamed Li.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 238. = The campaign against Wu Yuanji = In 814, with Emperor Xianzong preparing a campaign against the rebel Zhangyi Circuit (彰義, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), whose military governor Wu Shaoyang had just died and Wu Shaoyang's son Wu Yuanji had just seized the control of without imperial approval, Li Guangyan was moved from Ming Prefecture to be the prefect of Chen Prefecture (陳州, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), as part of a number of movements of generals in preparation for the campaign. Li Guangyan was also made the commander of the forces of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), to which Chen Prefecture belonged to. Later that year, after Wu Yuanji openly rebelled, Li was made the military governor of Zhongwu, serving under his old commander Yan, who was put in charge of the operations against Zhangyi. Almost alone among the imperial generals against Zhangyi, Li had repeated success against Zhangyi troops, and when Emperor Xianzong sent the official Pei Du to the front to review the troops in 815, Pei's report to Emperor Xianzong singled Li out as brave and righteous in his behavior. However, while often victorious, he was not always so, and he suffered a defeat in fall 815 at Shiqu (時曲, in modern Luohe, Henan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 239. Meanwhile, Emperor Xianzong, seeing Yan as an ineffective overall commander, put Han Hong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) in overall command of the forces. However, it was said that Han, who liked having authority, did not want Wu to be destroyed too quickly and disliked Li for his fervent campaigning. In order to subvert Li, Han found a beautiful woman who he had trained in singing, dancing, music and the game of Liubo, and dressed in fine clothes and luxurious jewels. He had his messenger deliver the woman to Li as a gift, in the hope that she would distract him from his military activities. When Han's messenger delivered the woman to Li at a grand feast, it was said that all of the guests were astonished by her beauty. However, Li responded to the messenger: He wept, as did the other guests. He then presented Han's messenger with gifts of his own for Han, and had the messenger deliver his gifts, along with the woman, back to Han, commenting, \\"Please thank the Lord Chancellor for me, Li Guangyan. I have promised the body to the empire, and I will not bear the sun or the moon together with the bandit [(i.e., Wu)]; I would rather die first.\\" There was another incident in which Li came in conflict with Han. On an occasion Han ordered a general attack against a Zhangyi city, the Zhangyi forces responded by concentrating a counterattack against Li's colleague Wu Chongyin, the military governor of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Pingdingshan, Henan), and the attack was so fierce that Wu Chongyin was hit by spears several times. He sought immediate aid from Li, and Li sent his officers Tian Ying () and Song Chaoyin () to attack the Zhangyi forces from behind. After Tian and Song were successful, the attack against Wu Chongyin was terminated. However, as Li violated Han's orders in doing so, Han had Tian and Song arrested and was ready to execute them. Li, fearing Han, did not dare to intercede directly, but the imperial eunuch Jing Zhongxin () happened to be present, and falsely ordered, in Emperor Xianzong's name, that Tian and Song be spared, before submitting a report to Emperor Xianzong as to what happened. Both Li and Han subsequently submitted conflicting reports, and Emperor Xianzong spared Tian and Song over Han's objections. Thereafter, Li and Wu Chongyin were repeatedly defeating Zhangyi troops, but there was no decisive victory. In summer 817, when Li attacked the important Zhangyi city of Yancheng (郾城, in modern Luohe), the defender of Yancheng, Deng Huaijin () offered to surrender to Li — but as Deng's and his soldiers' families were all at Zhangyi's capital prefecture Cai Prefecture (), Deng requested that he first be allowed to summon a relief army, and that Li then attack the relief army, before Deng would surrender, in hopes that Wu Yuanji would spare Deng's and his soldiers' families. Li agreed, and he subsequently defeated a Zhangyi army sent to relieve Yancheng, and Deng then surrendered. Wu Yuanji, in fear of continued advances by Li, sent his strongest soldiers, under Dong Chongzhi (), to be stationed at Huiqu (洄曲, in modern Luohe), to try to defend against a probable Li attack.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 240. Meanwhile, Emperor Xianzong had commissioned Pei to oversee the operations against Zhangyi, and when Pei arrived at the front, he made Yancheng his headquarters. There was an occasion when Pei was overseeing the construction of the fortress of Tuokou (沱口, in modern Luohe), when Dong launched a surprise attack, almost capturing Pei. The Zhangyi forces were fought off by Li and Tian Bu, however, allowing Pei to escape capture — as it was said that Li foresaw a potential surprise attack by Dong and therefore had stationed Tian nearby. With the Zhangyi forces concentrated on defending against Li Guangyan, Cai Prefecture was left relatively unguarded, and later in the year, Li Su the military governor of Tangsuideng Circuit (唐隨鄧, also headquartered in modern Zhumadian) was able to launch a surprise attack on Cai Prefecture, capturing Wu Yuanji. With Cai Prefecture having fallen and Dong having fled back to Cai Prefecture to surrender to Li Su, Li Guangyan entered Dong's camp and accepted the Zhangyi soldiers' surrender there. For his contributions, Li Guangyan was given the title of acting Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies). In spring 818, Emperor Xianzong had a eunuch hold a feast for him at the eunuch's mansion and gave him a large award of rice. Emperor Xianzong also personally welcomed Li Guangyan and awarded him a golden belt and multicolored banners. = After the campaign against Wu Yuanji = In summer 818, in preparation for the campaign against another warlord, Li Shidao the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), Emperor Xianzong moved Li Guangyan to be the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in Anyang, Henan). He was permitted to take some Zhongwu troops with him, and he subsequently, as part of the campaign against Li Shidao, defeated Pinglu forces at Puyang (濮陽, in modern Puyang, Henan). However, subsequently, Emperor Xianzong came to believe that Zhongwu and Yicheng forces should not be mixed, and therefore returned Li Guangyan to Zhongwu. In 819, during a Tufan incursion, Li Guangyan was moved to be the military governor of Binning Circuit (邠寧, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and permitted to take 6,000 Zhongwu soldiers with him. He was also put in charge of reconstructing Yan Prefecture (鹽州, in modern Yulin). At that time, the chancellor Huangfu Bo, whom Emperor Xianzong trusted, was in charge of the finances, and was not prompt in delivering supplies to the border defense troops. Worse, the supplies that he delivered were said to be so decrepit that the food could not be eaten and the clothes could not be worn; the soldiers were so angry that it was often rumored that mutinies would occur. Li was said to be so distressed that he considered committing suicide, as his petitions to Emperor Xianzong on the subject were not believed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 241.  During Emperor Muzong's reign  In 820, Emperor Xianzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong. Later that year, after Li Guangyan went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Muzong, he was given the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). Yet later that year, when Tufan forces attacked Jing Prefecture (涇州, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), of his neighboring Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered at Ping Prefecture), Li sent his forces to try to relieve Jing Prefecture. However, his soldiers were upset at the large rewards that the soldiers of the imperial Shence Army were receiving, requiring Li to personally and tearfully urge them to fight for the state. Eventually, as Li's soldiers were approaching Jing Prefecture, Tufan forces became fearful and withdrew. He was soon made the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). Late in 821, Li was again made the military governor of Zhongwu, in anticipation of his gathering Zhongwu troops in a campaign against Wang Tingcou, who had taken over Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Zhu Kerong, who had taken over Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), both of whom were resisting imperial authority. He was also made the commander of the imperial forces then at Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) — a prefecture belonging to Chengde whose prefect Niu Yuanyi () was holding out against Wang's siege — replacing Du Shuliang ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 242. However, when Li got to the front, it was said that while imperial forces were trying to rescue Niu in three different directions, they all lacked food supplies and were unable to advance, and even an accomplished general like Li had to simply protect his own forces first. In spring 822, with Shen Prefecture in desperate straits, the imperial government capitulated and commissioned Wang the military governor of Chengde, sending the official Han Yu to announce the commission and to persuade Wang to allow Niu to leave. Wang, while accepting the commission, still kept Shen Prefecture under siege for sometime; Niu had to fight his way out of the siege to flee to the imperial camps, and his remaining troops at Shen Prefecture were slaughtered. Meanwhile, to allow Li's forces to be supplied, Emperor Muzong temporarily made him the military governor of Henghai Circuit (橫海, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), where his army was stationed at the time, as well. When his soldiers believed that they would be kept at Henghai, however, they rioted, and Li was unable to control them. He became so fearful that he became ill, and he sent a petition to Emperor Muzong declining the Henghai commission. Emperor Muzong agreed, and kept his commission limited to Zhongwu and allowed him to return to Zhongwu's capital Xu Prefecture (). Late in the year, the soldiers of Xuanwu Circuit mutinied against their military governor Li Yuan (李愿, Li Su's brother), and Li Yuan was forced to flee. The soldiers supported an officer, Li Jie (李㝏) as their leader, and Li Jie sought imperial commission as military governor. Emperor Muzong refused, and commissioned Han Hong's brother Han Chong () as the new military governor, ordering Li Jie to report to Chang'an to serve as a general of the imperial guards. Li Jie refused and openly rose against the imperial government. In addition to Han Chong, Li Guangyan and Cao Hua () the military governor of Yanhai Circuit (兗海, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) also launched their troops against Li Jie. Li Jie was soon killed by his subordinate Li Zhi (), who surrendered to Han. For his contributions, Li Guangyan was given the honorary chancellor title of Shizhong ().  During Emperor Jingzong's and Wenzong's reigns  In 824, after Emperor Muzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Jingzong, Li Guangyan was made the military governor of Hedong and the mayor of Taiyuan; he was also made Situ (司徒, also one of the Three Excellencies). He died in 826 and was given posthumous honors, along with the posthumous name of Zhong (忠, \\"faithful\\"); at his burial, then-reigning Emperor Wenzong (Emperor Jingzong's brother) also bestowed a large award of silk.

Career After graduating from Yale, he briefly worked as a reporter for the New York Tribune, and then relocated to Frankfort, Kentucky.Williams, at 437. He read law there and was admitted to the state bar in 1880. In June of the same year he was elected the Douglas Fellow at Yale, which allowed him to continue his academic studies at the school.Id. at 437-38. In January 1882, the college made him a lecturer in the Latin Department, and he taught courses on Roman Law until June 1885.Id. at 438. Tighe published his notes the following year in a book entitled, The Development of the Roman Constitution. It was a popular textbook in the subject at Yale and other Ivy League colleges. In recognition of his work in Roman history, Yale awarded him an M.A. in 1891. After further reading law in New York City, Tighe moved to St. Paul, Minnesota in 1886, where he embarked upon an impressive career.

In addition, it is one of the two genera under the suborder Chondrophora, which is a group of cnidarians that also includes Velella.Deidun, Alan. “NOTES ON THE RECENT OCCURRENCE OF UNCOMMON PELAGIC ‘JELLYFISH’ SPECIES IN MALTESE COASTAL WATERS.” Naturalisa Siciliano, vol. 4, no. 34, ser. 3-4, 2010, pp. 375–384. 3-4. The chondrophores are similar to the better-known siphonophores, which includes the Portuguese man o' war, or Physalia physalis. Although it is superficially similar to a jellyfish, each apparent individual is actually a colony of hydrozoan polyps. The taxonomic class, Hydrozoa, falls under the phylum Cnidaria, which includes anemones, corals, and jellyfish, which explains their similar appearances.  Description  The blue button can grow up to 30 mm in diameter and lives on the surface of the sea and consists of two main parts: the float and the hydroid colony. The hard golden brown float is round, almost flat, and about one inch wide. The float organ is responsible for the organism’s vertical movementFryer G, Stanley GD (2004) A Silurian porpitoid hydrozoan from Cumbria, England, and a note on porpitoid relationships. Palaeontology 47(5):1109–1119 and also contains pores that are able to communicate with other P. porpita organisms as well as its surroundings. The hydroid colony, which can range from bright blue turquoise to yellow, resembles tentacles like those of the jellyfish\\"Identification Chart for Jellies.\\" Archived 2009-02-21 at the Wayback Machine. Each strand has numerous branchlets, each of the knobs of stinging cells called nematocysts terminates at the distal end. The blue button has a single mouth located beneath the float, which is used for both the intake of prey and the expulsion of wastes. The mouth is surrounded by a ring of gonozooids and dactylozooids. Tentacles are only found on the dactylozooids, which exist furthest away from the mouth, towards the outer part of the hydroid colony.  Habitat and Feeding  The blue button is a part of the neustonic food web, which covers the organisms that inhabit the region on or near the surface of the ocean. This is because it is a passive drifter, which means that it relies on water currents and wind to carry it through the ocean. It is preyed on by the sea slug Glaucus atlanticus (sea swallow or blue glaucus) and violet sea-snails of the genus JanthinaHayward P.J. & Ryland J.S. (1990). The Marine Fauna of the British Isles and North- West Europe. Volume 2 - Molluscs to Chordates. page 681. Clarendon Press, Oxford. . Unlike Velella, which prefers a passive diet, Porpita will hunt active crustaceans like crab and fish.Saygın, Özlem. (2017). On the occurrence of blue button, Porpita porpita (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) from Levantine coast of Turkey. Natural and Engineering Sciences. 2. 33-36. 10.28978/nesciences.328905. It competes with other drifters for food and mainly feeds on copepods and crustacean larvae.  Commensalism Between Porpita porpita and Caranx malabaricus  Young Caranx malabaricus, also known as the ‘Malabar jack’ or ‘Malabar kingfish’, have been shown to take shelter underneath the floats of Porpita porpita. Interestingly, when removed from its host, the fish will panic. These juvenile fish also appear to show preference for a particular siphonophore. When two pairs of Porpita porpita and Caranx malabaricus are separated by species, then returned to the same tank, the juvenile fish will return to their respective partners, even when forcibly separated from it.Noble A.(1963) Association between the fish, Caranx malabaricus Cuv. &Val.; and the siphonophore, Porpita pacifica Lesson.

It documents the lives of 79 immigrants living in Queens, each with a story to tell. The first-person narratives are drawn from audio-taped interviews, while the book's ever-changing graphics and typefaces mirror the rich pastiche of religion, language and tradition that coexists in the borough. Among the subjects: a Nigerian Pentecostal \\"prophetess,\\" public school teachers recruited from Austria, a lawyer from Columbia who delivers food and six exiled Chinese women who practice the gentle exercises of Falun Gong in a schoolyard. The Gill Prize was established 17 years ago to encourage innovative artistic responses to urban life and, in Brendan's own words, \\"help us to understand our city and its endless creative yield.\\" “Immigrant life in Queens, as told in the intimate, rich, comic, ironic and sad stories so often seen but not heard in America’s big cities... Archie Bunker doesn’t live here anymore – not in the Queens of Crossing the Blvd. The first-person narratives are engaging... The stories are so different, and yet many of the immigrants’ lives are so similar... What links them all is the desperation and desire that brought them here.

The style of fighting involves various kicks, dodges, and leg sweeps, with an emphasis on inverted positions, i.e. with one or more hands on the ground. The first mention of Engolo in literature was made by Albano Neves e Sousa in a set of drawings demonstrating various techniques and their similarities to the Afro-Brazilian art form of Capoeira in the 1960s. Engolo is one of several African martial arts of the African Diaspora in the Americas. Neves e Sousa described Engolo as part of a rite of passage, Omuhelo, between young boys vying for a bride in the contest, and whose techniques derived from the peculiar way in which Zebras fight amongst themselves. Research carried out by Dr. TJ Desch Obi finds that Engolo itself is not strictly performed for any one ritual, but as an element in various public and private performances. In his book Fighting for Honor, as well as his article \\"Combat and Crossing of the Kalunga\\", Desch Obi draws parallels between the circle space used in the Engolo and the inverted techniques with the Kalunga cosmology, in which the spirit–ancestor world is inverted as a world of opposites: where men walk on their feet, the spirits walk on their hands, where men are black, the spirits are white, where men reach their peak physical abilities in life, the ancestors reach their peak spirituality. He states that men in performing Engolo with its inverted positions connect themselves physically and spiritually with the ancestors, and with specific ancestral warriors of the past.

Life Charles Frank was born in Vilkomir, Lithuania in 1865. By 1910 he had immigrated to Glasgow and set himself up first as a mechanic. After a few years he married another immigrant, Miriam Lipetz, and eventually opened a shop at 67 SaltmarketA Photograph can be seen at The Life of Hannah Frank for the design, sale and repair of photographic and scientific apparatus. Over the following half century it was to become one of the best-known photographic centers in the city and a byword for excellence in cameras and watches. At some later stage the business expanded into a second premises located in Glasgow town centre at Ingram Street. This became a more upmarket showroom for the sale of his scientific instruments. A number of pieces from his optical instrument collection were placed on display there. Like many Jewish immigrants to Glasgow he settled in the Laurieston district of the Gorbals, first at 104 South Portland Street and then at 28 Abbotsford Place in 1917. A year or so later Frank moved south to 72 Dixon Avenue in Crosshill, an area popular with up-and-coming Jewish families and which, like the Gorbals, had its share of synagogues and kosher shops. Around 1950 Frank moved to Giffnock, to spend his old age in the growing Jewish community there. Family Charles and Miriam Frank had four children, Leo, Hannah, Arthur and Morris. Hannah Frank graduated in 1930 from the University of Glasgow, became a teacher and studied at the Glasgow School of Art.

The project was proposed in December 2008 by Liberty Green Renewables (LGR), based in Georgetown, Indiana. After significant opposition to its proposal by local community organizations, in 2011, LGR requested permanent revocation of two air permits and one acid rain permit it had been issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management. According to LGR representative, J.P. Rexroad, author of the request letter, dated September 26, 2011, \\"All of the sources permitted under the above-listed permits were never constructed or operated, and there are no longer any plans to do so.Clarion News - Crawford County The plant was originally to use woody biomass material from a number of local forest products and industrial sources, including residues from logging, land clearing activities, pallet manufacturing, furniture and cabinet manufacturing, sawmills, tree trimming and storm damage. Later, LGR amended its permit to include additional sources such as scrap wood from demolition, but was prohibited from using any wood contaminated with lead from paint or other sources, or arsenic and the like from pressure-treating processes. According to the company's original proposal, the facility would have used fluidized-bed boiler technology to enable incineration of a wide variety of woody biomass materials.http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474977557143 In LGR's first filing with the state, the company proposed discharging more than 170,000 gallons of water per day into the Blue River, but Terry Naulty of LGR told Fox 41 News the citizen response had prompted the company to propose, as an alternative, discharging the water onto its own property where it would grow energy crops and use it for irrigation water.\\" The area under discussion is karst geology, and it is unsure what impact the proposed discharge of large volumes of waste water would have had. The area underlying the proposed power plant is honeycombed with caves, fractures, and underground streams. Water dumped into \\"sink holes\\"—openings into the cave system—would typically migrate quickly though the rock via underground channels and fractures, possibly reaching the level of groundwater, or working its way into streams, wells, and rivers. The proposed site was adjacent to the Blue River, a state Wild and Scenic River area. In addition to citing air pollution concerns, local residents contended that they depended on the ground water for their drinking water, and the river and caves were habitat for state and federally endangered species such as the Hellbender salamander and the Indiana Cave Bat.

The festival is held each September at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Fairfax County, Virginia, which is the United States' only national park devoted solely to the performing arts. First conceived in 1971 as \\"International Children's Day\\", the festival provides opportunities for children to share aspects of their culture through the arts. The founder of the Wolf trap National Park for Performing Arts, Catherine Filene Shouse, also originated the festival.Biography of Catherine Filene Shouse The International Children's Festival is sponsored by the Arts Council of Fairfax County in cooperation with the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts and the National Park Service. Proceeds from the annual festival support the educational programs and services of the Arts Council of Fairfax County. It is held annually in September, typically on the 3rd weekend of the month. By the end of 2011, it was decided to conclude the tradition, amid financial issues. Performances The two-day weekend festival features many performers from several countries in musical and dance performances in four stages representative of their cultural heritage. The performers are dressed in traditional clothing and play many traditional songs which they dance to. Also featured are an Arts and Technology Pavilion with hands-on technology stations, international experiential tents where attendees can meet the international performers, learn the moves they saw on stage, and participate in craft projects to help them learn about international culture, and the Creative Kids Workshop featuring pavilions for hands-on arts projects and an instrument petting zoo.  Curriculum  An educational curriculum co- developed by the Arts Council of Fairfax County and Fairfax County Public Schools supports the learning opportunities available to students at the International Children's Festival.Arts Council of Fairfax County page for educators The curriculum is directed toward fifth grade classes and is also available for home-school and private school programs. Each year since 1994 the Festival has been the designated fine arts field trip for the entire 5th grade population in Fairfax County Public Schools – resulting in over 13,000 students coming to Wolf Trap during the week to see and meet the featured performers. The year 2001 was a particularly interesting year for the festival as thousands of students were en route to Wolf Trap when the events of September 11, 2001 took place.In 1995, Oklahoma City University was asked to assemble a children’s choir to represent OK just months after The Alfred P.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on May 20, 1939, and stars Sniffles in his cartoon debut. It is the only Sniffles cartoon not to be reissued, and therefore survives with its original titles.Sandler, p. 23, 54. Plot Sniffles is shown walking down a street carrying a piece of paper. He seems to show most of the obvious symptoms of the common cold and this is proven when, after looking at the name of the drug store he is standing outside, he looks at the paper in his hands, which is ripped, but gives details what to do about the cold virus. Satisfied that he is outside the right store, Sniffles creeps in through the letter box in the door and finds himself inside the drug store. He looks around and eventually spots the cold and flu remedies and makes his way to the shelf. He finds a bottle that claims to be a cold remedy but also has (in small writing at the bottom of the label.) the moniker \\"Alcohol 125% proof\\", which he misses as he only reads the top of the label. He opens the bottle, pours some of the mixture into a spoon and drinks it. Now getting slightly tipsy, Sniffles makes his way along the shelf and bumps into a box containing an electric razor. The razor comes out of its box and - using a buzzing noise, which can still be understood by the audience (with some difficulty) - the razor greets Sniffles. Sniffles advises the razor that he (Sniffles) has a cold, before promptly sneezing on him. Moments later, the razor also begins to show symptoms of the common cold. Sniffles informs the razor that he (the razor) has caught his cold and promises to get a cold remedy. After telling the razor several times not to move anywhere he leaves and comes back with the spoon filled with (presumably) the same cold remedy he had taken some minutes before. Now both Sniffles and the razor are feeling drunk and partake in a rendition of How Dry I Am. The razor then seems to get tired and Sniffles walks away. As he does so, a heretofore hidden black cat begins to follow him. Sniffles finds a claw vending machine and makes his way inside as something has grabbed his attention. The cat finds coins in a pocket (or at least somewhere in its fur) and tries to grab Sniffles. Eventually he succeeds and Sniffles, who had been oblivious to the existence of the cat, begins to get very scared. The razor wakes up and begins to attack the cat, shaving off the cats fur. The cat runs away. Sniffles thanks the razor, sneezes again and is blown backwards, and into the claw of the vending machine. The cartoon ends with Sniffles smiling, hanging from the claw by his trousers. See also *Herman and Katnip (Paramount Pictures cartoon) ReferencesBibliography *Sandler, Kevin S.

He began performing with Barlow's Minstrels in the 1890s, as a singer, dancer, and piano player, often working with actor John Queen and having several songs published. Bill Edwards, \\"Hugo \\"Hughie\\" Cannon\\", RagPiano.com. Retrieved 5 April 2017 He occasionally worked as a bar pianist in Jackson, Michigan, where he met local musician Willard \\"Bill\\" Bailey. Reportedly, on one occasion in 1902, Bailey was talking to Cannon about the state of his marriage to Sarah (née Siegrist). Cannon \\"was inspired to rattle off a ditty about Bailey’s irregular hours. Bailey thought the song was a scream, and he brought home a dashed-off copy of the song to show Sarah. Sarah couldn’t see the humor.... [but] accepted without comment the picture it drew of her as a wife.\\" Cannon sold all rights to the song to a New York publisher.James A. Treloar, \\"The Bill Bailey Who Didn’t Come Home\\", Detroit Sunday News Magazine, June 17, 1973, at SFtradjazz.org. Retrieved 5 April 2017 The tune is similar to an earlier song, \\"Ain't Dat a Shame\\" credited to Queen and Walter Wilson. After publication the song quickly became a hit and then a standard, has been covered many times since by a wide range of singers, including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey, Marion Montgomery, Aretha Franklin, and Bobby Darin. The song became an instant success following its first performance by John Queen. Another of the author's long-lasting hits is \\"Frankie and Johnny\\", published in 1904. Cannon wrote the featured song \\"I Love the Two Steps (With My Man)\\" for the New York show 'Mrs. Black Is Back', which opened in 1904 and ran for 79 performances. Mrs. Black was played by May Irwin, who also appeared in one of Thomas Edison's earliest productions, \\"The Kiss.\\" Cannon also wrote music for \\"A Venetian Romance\\" at the Knickerbocker Theater. Cannon's other songs include \\"For Lawdy Sakes, Feed My Dog,\\" \\"I Hates To Get Up Early In The Morning\\", \\"Possum Pie\\", \\"Just Because She Made Dem Goo- Goo Eyes\\" and \\"You Needn't Come Home.\\" Death Cannon died at the age of 35 at the Lucas County, Ohio, Infirmary. The official cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver. Not long before his death, Cannon told a Detroit newspaper that he sold off the rights to most of his songs. In a letter to his mother he lamented \\"the songs I once had.\\" He told the same newspaper that while he also used drugs, it was alcohol that was the hardest to kick. A brief marriage to Emma Dorson ended in divorce, the final decree handed to her just hours after his death. Cannon died penniless. He was buried in Connellsville, Pennsylvania, where his mother lived. His mother, May Brown Cannon Smith Robbins, had been in show business and had played the role of \\"Little Trixie\\" in a production that toured the nation for several years in the late 1800s. By the time her son became a well-known composer she was managing a theater in Connellsville with the help of her third husband Fred G. Robbins. Not much is known about the composer's actor father, John Cannon. Criticism Musicologist Peter Muir remarked that \\"You Needn't Come Home\\" was \\"truly remarkable for 1901\\" for its unusual use of 12-bar arrangements for both chorus and verse. \\"In terms of popular songs at the turn of the century, the enterprise, to the best of my knowledge, is quite unique.\\"Long Lost Blues: Popular Blues in America, 1850-1920 (University of Illinois Press, 2009). Thornton Hagert (founder of Vernacular Music Research), in 1971, noted Cannon's use of a 12-bar structure. \\"A few\\" of Cannon's better-known songs, Hagert found, \\"are very close to the classic blues structure.\\" Two years after \\"Bill Bailey\\" swept the nation, Cannon composed a tune called \\"He Done Me Wrong.\\" This \\"death of Bill Bailey\\" tune is sad, Muir noting \\"a powerful ambivalence often found in the blues.\\" Muir argued that Cannon's \\"music represents in its way the birth of commercial blues in American culture.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Hugo \\"Hughie\\" Cannon on ragpiano.com *Imdb for 1904 show \\"Mrs. Black Is Back\\" with music by Hughie Cannon * * Category:1877 births Category:1912 deaths Category:American composers Category:American male composers Category:American male pianists Category:American male songwriters Category:American lyricists Category:American pianists Category:Ragtime composers Category:Ragtime pianists ","title":"Hughie Cannon"},{"id":"21791063","text":"Daniel Rooseboom de Vries (born 12 August 1980) is a Dutch freestyle footballer from Gorinchem, Netherlands.

In the 1930s the original German company was expropriated from its German-Jewish owners, the Frankel-Stiebel family, by the Nazi regime and renamed KHG - Knopf Handelsgesellschaft GmbH, a formal name that the German Butonia company still bears today. In the 1930s, the Frankel-Stiebel family relocated to London, England and the British company, Butonia (London) Ltd., became the main group company. In the Netherlands, the Guggenheim family were partners in Butonia BV with the British shareholders prior to the Second World War, became joint shareholders of the entire group in 1994 and bought out the other shareholder groups in 2002. In 2003 Butonia opened a subsidiary in Lithuania in order to deal with increasing Eastern European manufacture. In 1997 and 2000, respectively, Butonia opened subsidiaries in Bangalore, India and Hong Kong. These businesses were taken over by the Ruby Enterprises group in late 2002, headed by Ilan Shavit, the son of Richard Stiebel, and were rebranded in India and Guangzhou, China as Ryyty Apparel Resources in 2009.

The community is located near the junction of US 460 and US 220 Alternate. History Bonsack was located along an early road called the \\"Trader's Path,\\" from Augusta County, Virginia, now part of Highway 460. Established in 1740, the Trader's Path and led from Lynchburg, Virginia to Big Lick, Virginia, and was used to bring settlers and traders from central Virginia into the Roanoke Valley. A large number of German Baptists, also called \\"Church of the Brethren,\\" settled here after the Revolutionary War, and the community had several different names, including \\"Glade Creek\\" and \\"Stoner's Store\\". It was named \\"Bonsack\\" after the family donated land for a depot and track for the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, which was constructed in 1852.Frazier Associates. 1992. \\"Historical Architecture Reconnaissance Survey Report.

During the Civil War, Bonsack was raided by troops from Union General David Hunter in June 1864. The troops burned the woolen mill and the train depot. They also confiscated food and destroyed personal property. \\"A number of the railroad- related resources that do survive have been heavily altered, so additional historical research would be needed to document their connection to the railroad. For example, at Bonsack, a turn-of-the-century house survives that was once the stationmaster's house, but this connection would not be obvious merely from an examination of the building. While some railroad resources, such as depots, were often built specifically for that purpose, in other cases, older buildings were reused as the community's needs changed.\\"Frazier Associates. 1992. \\"Historical Architecture Reconnaissance Survey Report. Roanoke, Virginia.\\" April 1992. Page 70. The town is named for a former resident, James Albert Bonsack, who invented the first practical cigarette paper rolling machine in 1880. Other sources say the name came earlier, during the 1850s, from the Bonsack family who donated land for the railroad depot and track through the village. There was a short mining boom in the 1880s, when deposits of zinc were found on David Plaine's property, near the Bonsack railroad depot. In 1888, about 11,878 tons of zinc ore were shipped out, but mining stopped by 1895.Kagey, Deedie Dent. Community at the Crossroads: A Study of the Village of Bonsack of the Roanoke Valley. Roanoke, VA:privately published, 1983. Page 288. The Bonsack area was also known for their orchards during the 1920s, and in the large groves they grew apples and peaches. The Roanoke area was ranked eighth in peach production, and ninth in apple production in Virginia, between 1925-1939.

He currently serves as a member of the Knesset for Likud and Minister of Regional Cooperation. He has previously held the posts of Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Social Services and Minister of Science and Technology. BiographyEarly life= Akunis was born in Tel Aviv, to a father of Greek-Jewish descent who immigrated to Israel in 1934 and was a member of the Likud Party himself. His mother was Jewish and immigrated from Poland in 1957. He attended the Herzliya Hebrew High School between 1987 and 1991. He served as youth correspondent for the weekly \\"Ma'ariv LaNoar\\" magazine. During his national service he served as a military correspondent for the Chief Education Officer of the Education and Youth Corps. After his army service he served as music editor of the radio program \\"Youth Club\\" on Reshet Gimmel, and on other programs. He completed his bachelor's degree in political science and international relations at the Open University. In January 1992, he joined the Likud party and began working in the information department at Metzudat Ze'ev in Tel Aviv. In June 1996, when Binyamin Netanyahu became Prime Minister after winning the elections, Ofir Akunis served as Deputy Media Advisor to the Prime Minister. He subsequently became spokesman for the Likud party. In 2003 he won the Menachem Begin Award for his thesis \\"Morals and Realism in Israeli Politics\\". He later worked as a spokesman for the Minister of Justice, and in 2004 was appointed Media Advisor for Netanyahu in the Ministry of Finance. He continued to serve as his advisor until 2008 before being appointed as Deputy Director of Communications and Information for the Likud. =The 18th Knesset= Prior to the 2009 elections, Akunis participated in the primaries for the Likud and reached the 28th place. He submitted a petition to the election committee of the Likud together with other candidates. On 12 December 2008 the petition was accepted, and subsequently was promoted to the 26th place on the list, which is reserved for the Tel Aviv district. Post factum, it turned out that if the petition was not accepted, he would not have been elected to the Knesset, as the Likud won 27 mandates in the elections. Akunis was subsequently moved up to twenty-sixth place, and entered the Knesset as Likud won 27 seats. During his first two years as a Knesset member, Ofir Akunis served as Chairman of the Economic Committee. He was also appointed Deputy Speaker of the House. After the flotilla to Gaza, Ofir Akunis confronted the Knesset members of the Balad party several times, and even announced several times that as the Likud's representative to the Central Elections Committee he would demand the disqualification of their list and the disqualification of MK Hanin Zuabi, who participated in the flotilla. After recruiting a majority of 19 supporters against 9 opponents, the Central Elections Committee disqualified Zuabi from running for the 19th Knesset. During a pre-vote debate, Akunis said, \\"Zuabi did not stop undermining the State of Israel, and openly incited against it and against IDF soldiers. He participated in the flotilla, do you need any more than that to disqualify her candidacy?\\" After a few days, the Supreme Court overturned the decision. According to the statistics of the Knesset Ofir Akunis is considered a very active member, both in the Knesset plenum and in the committees in which he participates. Economic Committee Activities During his service as Chairman of the Economic Committee, Ofir Akunis collaborated with the Minister of Communications Moshe Kahlon in opening the cellular communications market to competition, including supporting a decrease in link fees and adding virtual operators and new companies to this market. He promoted the consumer cash refund law and initiated the reverse interest law. In the television sector he promoted legislation regulating the transition from franchises to licenses, and initiated the increase of channels broadcast free of charge by the \\"Idan+\\" DDT broadcasting service. He objected to the Ministry of Finance's demand to increase radio and television fees, and actually lead to its decrease. In discussions led by the committee on state royalties on oil and gas profits, Akunis objected to the new fund's initiative to increase royalties to 80%. However, after the publication of the Shinsky Committee's recommendations, the Knesset voted in favor of the \\"Oil Profit Tax Law.\\" Legislation Ofir Akunis promoted consumer, civilian and political related legislation, among them: * Legislation enabling parking at bus stations on holidays * Legislation providing free water saving devices (\\"chaschamim\\") * Legislation prohibiting cable and satellite broadcasting companies to charge fines for terminating services * In December 2010 an amendment to the Flag and State Symbol Law was approved, stipulating that State flags must be manufactured in Israel. The amendment was submitted together with MK Shelly Yechimovitch and other MKs * Proposed legislation requiring a referendum to be held for any future political agreement with the Palestinian Authority regarding the future of Yehuda and Shomron * MK Akunis is one of the initiators of the \\"Embargo Prohibition Law\\", the purpose of which is to prevent any party banning Israel to benefit from financing or services provided by the State, including prohibiting their entrance into the country Additional functions in the Knesset and the Likud * Member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee * Member of the State Inspection Committee * Member of the Children's Rights Committee * Joint Chairman (together with MK Shai Chermesh) of the \\"Knesset Forum for International Relations \\" lobby * Chairman of the Committee for issues relating to the Second Television and Radio Authority * Chairman of the Likud's response team * Likud's representative in the Central Elections Committee =The 19th Knesset= In the elections held for the Likud's list of candidates for the 19th Knesset, Akunis was elected to the 18th place, placed in the 29th place in the joint Likud – Yisrael Beiteinu list and was once again elected to serve in the Knesset. In March 2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Akunis as Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, acting as the liaison between the government and the Knesset with the portfolio of the Advancement of Young People and Students. As the liaison between the government and the Knesset, Akunis Respond, on Behalf of the government, against Motion of no confidence from opposition's parties. He spoke much about \\"Prawer plan\\", the negotiations with the Palestinians and The Israeli settlements in the West Bank.  Deputy Minister of Environmental Protection  On December 9, 2014, Akunis was appointed Deputy Minister of Environmental Protection. Akunis replaced Amir Peretz, who resigned from his post as Minister.http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/AboutUs/Minister/Pages/default- minister.aspx The appointment, made by the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, came a week after the massive crude oil spill in Israel's Arava region. Akunis said that \\"it is the Deputy Minister's intention to prioritize treatment of the ecological disaster in the south and to do all that is necessary to prevent the spread of the crude oil, and to prevent a health and environmental disaster.\\"http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/ResourcesandServices/NewsAndEvents/NewsAndMessageDover/Pages/2014/y%20December/Ophir- Akunis-Appointed-Deputy-Environmental-Protection-Minister.aspx Akunis ordered crews to raise the side walls of the dams that had been built in the Arava to prevent flooding. Thanks to the infrastructure that had already been built in the area, the risk that the oil would reach the Gulf of Eilat significantly dropped. Akunis instructed that the reserve remain closed as long as high values of pollutants were still registered in air quality tests. In the end of December, the government approved a NIS 17 million Environment Ministry plan to rehabilitate. According to Akunis, the NIS 17 million program would serve to treat the soils contaminated by the spill as well as help restore the wildlife populations damaged over the course of the event. As part of the plan, a special team would be appointed to evaluate the environmental impact of various Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Company activities on both dry land and beaches. The approved plan also involved opening a closed Eilat beach on EAPC- owned property to the city's residents and visitors. In January 2015, Air quality tests found that there has been a 90% reduction of pollution in Evrona. In July 2017, the beach opened as promised.  \\"Computer for Every Child\\"  For his own request, Akunis was appointed by Binyamin Netanyahu to lead the 'Computer for Every Child' project. He said that \\"This is one of the most important social projects taking place in Israel,\\" and added \\"that reducing the technological gaps is a critical element in reducing social disparities.\\" Akunis promised that he will work to \\"promote, strengthen and upgrade\\" the project. During 2013, the project has been upgraded from \\"Computer for Every Child\\" to \\"Tablet for the Whole Classroom\\" and Tablets Distributed to Children of Sderot, Ofakim, Lod etc. In October 2014, Akunis announced that the government had allocated NIS 1.8 million to provide tablets for each and every child living in the south. =The 20th Knesset= Prior to the 2015 elections, Akunis participated in the primaries for the Likud and reached the 15th place. On May 14, 2015 Akunis was sworn in as a Minister in the 34th Government of Israel. In June 2015, Akunis was authorized by the Prime Minister to be the Broadcasting Authority and the Second Television and Radio Authority. After his appointment, Bezeq led to changes in the Public Broadcastibng Law. The changes included renaming the law to the \\"Israeli Public Braodcasting Law\\" abd final cancellation of the television fee. These changes were criticized by his predecessor, Minister Gilad Erdan, and received support from the Ministry of Finance and The New General Workers Union. Following a controversy with the Prime Minister, he resigned as head of the Broadcasting Authority and the Second Television and Radio Authority. Minister of Science and Technology On September 2, 2015, Akunis was appointed Ministry of Science and Technology replacing Danny Danon who was appointed Israel's envoy to the United Nations. In July 2018, Akunis refused to approve a recommendation from his office to appoint Professor Yael Amitai to the Board of Governors of the German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development, stating that in 2005 Amitai signed a petition supporting the refusal to serve in the territories. The academy was harshly criticized for this decision, but Akunis adhered to his decision. Prof. Amitai and the heads of universities filed a petition with the High Court against this decision by Akunis. The Attorney General and the State Attorney's Office filed suit against Akunis, but at the court hearing he continued to hold his position. Due to opposition from the Attorney General to give Akunis an outside legal representation, he decided to represent himself in court and appeared at every Supreme Court hearing and argued before the panel. Amitai eventually accepted the appointment of Akunis' replacement, Izhar Shay. In January 2020, he was appointed Minister of Labor, Welfare and Social Services instead of the Prime Minister. The 23rd Knesset On the 35th day of the new Israeli government (in 2020), Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Akunis would be appointed Minister of Regional Cooperation while Gilad Erdan, who held the position before Akunis, was appointed Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations. =Opinions= MK Akunis has mentioned many times that he operates in the spirit of the late Menachem Begin. When commencing his function as Chairman of the Economic Committee he committed himself to a \\"free economy with social sensitivity\\", which is the basis of the Likud's outlook. He supports the concept of decreasing direct and indirect taxes imposed on the public. Akunis is also of the opinion that one of the ways to reduce prices is to abolish monopolies and duopolies, breaking up centralizations and encouraging competition in the Israeli market, also by reducing custom fees on imported products. His views on political and security issues place Akunis in the right wing of the Likud: he is opposed to the formula \\"two states for two nations\\" and perceives the Palestinians as an obstacle for peace in the Middle East. In the past he has proposed a 20 year long-term intermediate settlement, so that \\"the Palestinians born now will not be educated on the narrative of the right of return to Acre, Ramla, Lod, Jaffa and Ashkelon\\". Akunis is opposed to relinquishing the Occupied Territories and supports settlement in all parts of the country \\"with no disparity between the Golan, the Galil, the Negev or Yehuda and Shomron\\". Akunis believes that Israel has the historical and moral right to the territory under Israeli control, according to the teachings of Jabotinsky, \\"All Mine\\". MK Akunis supports the strategic alliance between Israel and the United States, but mentioned more than once that Israel is an independent State in its decisions. He has expressed support of the peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt. Akunis, who sponsored the bill to limit foreign funding to Israeli human rights organization, stood behind Senator Joseph's McCarthy's actions in the 1950s. Speaking on December 5 on the \\"London and Kirshenbaum\\" television show on Israel's Channel 10, Akunis referenced Mccarthy– who in the 1950s presided over a committee that investigated Americans suspected of harboring Communist views – said \\"was right in every word, the fact is -there were Soviet agents. On September 3, 2015, Akunis, who was responsible for the state broadcasting legislation, submitted and defended the clause barring journalists from the IBA from expressing their opinions on-air. After wide public protest and Prime-minister Netanyahu's retreat from supporting the clause, Akunis immediately gave in his responsibility and resigned. =Personal life= Ofir Akunis is married to Adi and father of their two children. He is a resident of Tel Aviv-Jaffa.

However, he is best known for being an avid boater and for the many trips he took via waterways in a 12-foot aluminum fishing boat. The combined distance of these trips was 55,000 miles, over twice the circumference of the earth.  Childhood  Bill Harris was born in 1912, the youngest of two brothers. His father was a doctor who contracted and died from the Spanish flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when Bill was 6. Bill was raised separately from his brother by an older cousin and his wife. When Bill was 10 years of age he learned to drive a car. He got his first job shortly thereafter transporting people from their homes to a local doctor's office. At the age of 12 Bill started work at a local theater. Guntersville Dam In 1933 after the passing of the Tennessee Valley Authority act, engineers came to the Guntersville area looking for a location for a dam that would provide river stability, waterways for transport, and hydroelectricity for the area. Bill was hired to transport TVA engineers by boat to scout the river for a location for the Guntersville Dam. After the dam was complete and the reservoir flooded, Bill used his boat to give tours for visitors who came to see the newly formed lake. Lake Theatre Bill and his wife Dora owned and operated a theater in the Guntersville area called the Lake Theatre. Bill and Dora became known as \\"Mr. and Mrs. Entertainment\\". The theater would show movies and musical concerts. Some of the notable concerts featured Jerry Lee Lewis. Every Christmas Eve they would host a free show for kids. Waterway Journeys \\"Mississippi\\" Bill was most famous for his waterway trips in his 12-foot aluminum boat he named the \\"Miss Guntersville Lake\\". The first notable trip was in 1968. The trip started in Guntersville Lake and ended in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The trip took over 5 days. Bill would call into local radio shows every morning to update everyone on his journey. He would usually travel with another person and they would sleep on boat docks at night. Bill claimed to have been shot at many times by disgruntled boat dock owners. Whenever Bill would pass through the Nashville area and he would stay on Johnny Cash's boat dock, Bill claimed Cash would sing and play guitar for him and his partner. Bill received a key to the city from many cities, most notably New Orleans. A newspaper article once said that \\"Mississippi Bill Harris has more keys to cities than most Presidents of the United States\\". Bill took a total of 23 trips over a 30-year span, heading all the way north to Chicago and as far south as New Orleans and Mobile. The total of his combined trips was 55,000 miles. He was mentioned in many river town local newspapers, which is where he got the nickname \\"Mississippi Bill\\" for traveling the Mississippi River so often. =List of trips= * 1967 - Guntersville, AL. - Knoxville, TN. * 1968 - Guntersville, AL. - New Orleans, LA. * 1969 - Guntersville, AL. - Nashville, TN. * 1970 - Guntersville, AL. - Knoxville, TN. * 1971 - Guntersville, AL. - St. Louis, MO. * 1972 - Guntersville, AL. - New Orleans, LA - St. Louis, MO. * 1973 - Guntersville, AL. - New Orleans, LA - St. Louis, MO. - Nashville, TN. * 1974 - Guntersville, AL. - St. Louis, MO. * 1975 - Guntersville, AL. - Nashville, TN. * 1976 - Guntersville, AL. - Memphis, TN. * 1977 - Guntersville, AL. - Little Rock, AR. * 1978 - Guntersville, AL. - Marietta, Ohio * 1980 - Guntersville, AL. - Saint Charles, Missouri - Nashville, TN. * 1981 - Guntersville, AL. - Clinton, Iowa * 1982 - Guntersville, AL. - Pittsburgh, PA * 1983 - Guntersville, AL. - St. Louis, MO * 1984 - Guntersville, AL. - Saint Paul, Minnesota * 1985 - Guntersville, AL. - Nashville, TN - Demopolis, AL * 1986 - Guntersville, AL. - Mobile, Alabama * 1987 - Guntersville, AL. - Hopkins County, Kentucky * 1991 - Guntersville, AL. - Paducah, Kentucky - Demopolis, AL * 1997 - Guntersville, AL. - Chicago, IL - Lake Michigan +(on his 85th Birthday) Later life In the 1980s Guntersville celebrated a Bill Harris day. Even though Bill never had children of his own, he loved kids. He was known to give every kid he met a quarter to buy candy with. For most of Bill's later life he was usually the grand marshal of the Guntersville Christmas parade, in which he was pulled in his boat on a trailer. Equipped on the boat was a megaphone that Bill would cheer \\"Roll Tide\\" on as he rode through the parade.

It lived in the Silurian period. It was a couple of centimetres long and half a centimetre wide, and comprises serially repeated units with seven or eight shells, and rings of 'spines'. Some of its characters are reminiscent of the polychaete worms, and the character combinations do not place it obviously in the stem of any modern mollusc group, but although it was originally interpreted as a polychaete, this position is untenable for a number of reasons.  Morphology  The organism resembles a bristled worm, but bears a number of shells on its upper surface. The first shell is cap-like, whereas the others are saddle-shaped. The rearmost shell is almost rectangular, whereas the others are more circular, with spines on the rear surface of the third to sixth shells. The originally-aragonitic shells do not overlap. There are eighteen rows of spines projecting from ridges in the body surface, which encircle the body except for its bottom surface, which presumably bore a molluscan foot.

Background  Maritime information sharing has been demonstrated as an effective means of improving security, safety and environmental protection, while increasing efficiency and reducing friction for legitimate commerce. The policies that govern the use and sharing of information by the U.S. federal government are being revised in order to permit and promote information sharing. GMISS gives the maritime industry an ongoing forum to help shape the development of maritime information sharing policies.  Symposium Framework  This annual symposium brings together representatives of the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and government agencies to collaborate on a global system of maritime information sharing. The symposium supports the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration (MARAD) in developing a coherent federal outreach and coordination effort. Leading up to this symposium, the U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) had expressed the need to expand their relationship with industry as set forth in the Cooperative Strategy for a 21st Century Seapower. As government agencies have increasingly realized the benefits to be gained by partnering with the maritime industry however, there has been a flurry of \\"commercial outreach\\" and a deluge of information requests that are overwhelming industry and rapidly eroding its eagerness and ability to respond . The maritime community, both directly and through its various associations, has expressed frustration and confusion over the seemingly uncoordinated efforts in support of and demands being place on maritime trade and security by government entities. The GMISS was undertaken as an effort to harness this government energy for engagement and establish a means to coordinate a more cohesive dialogue between government and maritime industry representatives. GMISS is an opportunity to demonstrate that a USN/USCG/MARAD partnership can open the doors of communication to further advance the maritime strategy, and equally, begin to provide the coordination necessary to present a unified voice to the maritime community. The long range (multi-year) objectives of the GMISS include: * Coordinate the U.S. Government's maritime commercial outreach * Implement industry/government working groups * Highlight specific government relationships * Promote regional involvement * Engage a diverse range of stakeholders  GMISS Working Groups  A key differentiator of GMISS from other government-to-maritime industry outreach conferences is the ongoing working groups of industry and government subject matter experts developed through the symposium that continue to collaborate throughout the year. The working groups enable participants to help define the industry-government information-sharing relationship. As a multi-agency office coordinating maritime awareness efforts for the U.S. federal government, OGMSA coordinates participation by subject matter experts from across the government and brings issues before the decision makers who are shaping maritime information sharing policy through the National Maritime Domain Awareness Stakeholders Board and the U.S. Maritime Security Policy Coordinating Committee. OGMSA provides a working group administrator for each team of subject matter experts to coordinate issues through the interagency community. Working Groups from previous GMIS symposia provide status reports at the following year's symposium, leading to resolution, recommitment, or redefinition of the issues.  GMISS 2008  The inaugural Global Maritime Information Sharing Symposium (GMISS) was held on August 20–21, 2008 at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) in Kings Point, New York and brought together a more than 125 participants from maritime companies, associations, navies, coast guards and government agencies from around the world. = Symposium Structure = Through an \\"issue-to-working- group\\" progression in this inaugural GMISS, and reflecting the needs of this inaugural symposium's main sponsors—OGMSA, the Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), U.S. Fleet Forces Command's Naval Cooperation and Guidance for Shipping (NCAGS), and MARAD, the broad topic of open maritime data sharing was approached from three particular vantage points: * Law Enforcement Information Sharing in the Maritime Environment (The Evolution of Fusion Centers and Information Sharing with Law Enforcement) * Regional Blue Water Information Sharing (Increased understanding and liaison with commercial shipping) * Industry and Maritime Information Sharing (Increased understanding and data sharing with the commercial maritime industry) Symposium attendees were asked to formulate their thoughts around five core questions: * How can the U.S. Government be more coherent in its approach to the maritime industry? * What should be the model for information sharing between the U.S. Government and the maritime industry? * What are the unexploited maritime information sharing opportunities that will benefit the flow of commerce and help trade? * How do we leverage the national strategy for maritime domain awareness to further these efforts? * Is there value in continuing an annual symposium such as GMISS as the center of focus for issues and innovations? This combination of vantage points and core questions was focused in four working groups, each addressing a specific issue. These issues had been developed during OGMSA's work with such maritime associations as the World Shipping Council, the Cruise Line International Association (CLIA), and numerous individual industry representatives. * Working Group A: Issue - Can Government Information Requests to Shipping Companies be Consolidated, Streamlined, Standardized or Reduced? * Working Group B: Issue - What is the Law Enforcement/Industry Model for an International/Domestic Maritime Information Sharing Center? * Working Group C: Issue - What does the Maritime Industry Want from the World's Navies and Coast Guards? * Working Group D: Issue - How do we Create Economic Incentives for Maritime Information Sharing? =GMISS 2008 Working Group Findings = Consolidated Summary findings as generated from the symposium's four independent working groups can be summarized into the following eight categories and potential courses of action: * Inventory: Establish baseline maritime information requirements (both government's and industry's) * Cost/benefit: Determine the cost of providing information that is requested or required versus its intended and real benefits * Standardize: Standardize the requested information and the procedures for its exchange, globally * Portals/Hubs: Set up commercially based \\"portals/hubs\\" through which maritime data can be centralized/exchanged * Incident Exchange: Set up a global incident information exchange for use by industry/navy/coast guards * Market: Market all the above broadly across industry/government/navy/coast guards to ensure broadest involvement from all possible stakeholders * Acta non verba: (i.e. these issues have been discussed enough, let's make them happen). A summary of individual working group discoveries and action items can be found in the Attachment section of this report. =GMISS 2008 Conclusions= The concept behind GMISS and its inaugural symposium appear to have been well received by both industry and government attendees as expressed by their subsequent comments and of greater importance, by the significant number of industry attendees volunteering to continue to participate in the working groups. The symposium topics set forth through the symposium agenda, outlined via plenary and break-out presentations and then refined to issues through working groups also appear to be along the same lines as those being wrestled with at the various USG inter-agency MDA meetings of which OGMSA has been a part. In preparing the summary report for GMISS 2008, OGMSA compared GMISS outcomes with the materials from other U.S. Government commercial outreach conferences and symposia, including: * The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Protecting The Global Supply Chain Conference of June 2, 2008 * The Marcus-Evans Global Maritime Capabilities Conference of July 9, 2008: specifically remarks by Capt J. Stephen Maynard, USN, U.S. Naval War College entitled Integrating the Commercial Shipping Industry into A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century * The Maritime Information Sharing Taskforce (MIST) Symposium of August 20-21, 2008 * The U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command MARLU Conference of Sept 17-18, 2008 * The U.S. Naval War College Shipping Workshop of October 29, 2008 This comparison indicated a parallel trend of issues being brought forth by industry participants regardless of venue including: * The need for the U.S. Government to speak a singular MDA message * The need for a coordination of U.S. Government maritime information requests of industry * The need for a single portal to send requested data to for subsequent internal U.S. Government distribution * The need for a cost/benefit analysis of data being requested or required * The need for reciprocity on data requests * The need for action towards mutually beneficial solutions. = GMISS 2008 Summary Report = The complete summary report from GMISS 2008 is available on OGMSA's Maritime Awareness Wiki.

When the Interior Museum opened in the U.S. Department of the Interior's newly- constructed headquarters in the nation's capital on March 8, 1938, a museum was considered a novel element to include in a federal office building. However, the Secretary of the Interior at that time—Harold Ickes (1874-1952)—was a proponent of the arts and also strongly believed in the importance of having the American people understand the work of the Department. To this day, the Interior Museum's mission remains to actively educate and inspire employees and the public about the ongoing stewardship of the nation's public lands, natural resources, and cultural heritage. The Interior Museum's collection contains more than 8,000 objects of historical, cultural, and scientific importance relating directly to the activities of the Department. In addition to developing exhibitions and public programs, Interior Museum staff also conduct public tours highlighting the elements that made the Stewart Lee Udall Department of the Interior Building a \\"symbol of a new day\\" during the Great Depression. The headquarters building contains more New Deal-era murals than any other government building, featuring such artists as John Steuart Curry, Maynard Dixon, William Gropper, Allan Houser, Velino Herrera, and Millard Sheets, plus a series of photomurals by Ansel Adams. Admission is free, but valid photo identification must be presented to enter the building. Museum hours are Monday through Friday, 8:30AM to 4:30PM (closed federal holidays).

It also awards an M.F.A. in Design Studies. History The University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Human Ecology dates to the spring of 1903. With support from women's organizations around the state, the University Board of Regents, and Belle Case La Follette (the governor's wife), the state legislature funded the establishment of the Department of Home Economics. On June 16, 1903, Caroline Hunt became its first professor. Over time, the department expanded to serve the needs of the University and surrounding community. One outreach effort was the creation of the Dorothy Roberts Nursery School in response to a request from area mothers in 1926. The department also added and developed new and more focused majors such as foods and nutrition, textiles, applied bacteriology, related art, and home economics journalism. All of this occurred under the direction of Abby Marlett. After taking over from Abby Marlett in 1939, Frances Zuill worked to further develop the department, so that it became the School of Home Economics within the College of Agriculture. The school continued to grow and became a separate unit, autonomous from the College of Agriculture in 1973. The original Department of Home Economics underwent several name changes over the years, most recently changing from the School of Family Resources and Consumer Economics to its current name, the School of Human Ecology, in 1996.

Andrew J. Fenady, author of the novel, produced the film and wrote the screenplay. Plot summary A man calling himself Sam Marlowe (Robert Sacchi) has his face altered to resemble that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, and then opens a detective agency. At first he and his secretary Duchess (Misty Rowe) have meager business, but things pick up after a shooting puts Sam's picture in the paper. Some ruthless people, who are coincidentally also similar to characters in Bogart films (and played by Victor Buono, Herbert Lom, and Michelle Phillips), are after a priceless set of blue sapphires called the Eyes of Alexander (from a statue of Alexander the Great), and Marlowe and Duchess are caught in the middle of it all. Cast *Robert Sacchi – Sam Marlowe *Franco Nero – Hakim *Michelle Phillips – Gena *Olivia Hussey – Elsa *Herbert Lom – Mr. Zebra *Misty Rowe – Duchess *Victor Buono – Commodore Anastas *Sybil Danning – Cynthia *Richard Bakalyan – Lieutenant Bumbera *Gregg Palmer – Sergeant Hacksaw *Jay Robinson – Wolf/Zinderneuf *George Raft – Petey Cane *Yvonne De Carlo – Teresa Anastas *Mike Mazurki – Himself *Henry Wilcoxon – Mr. Chevalier *Victor Sen Yung – Mr. Wing Original novel The film was based on the debut novel by Andrew J. Fenady who wrote it in long hand over 23 days. Fenady had been writer and producer of television shows and movies for 30 years and was always interested in turning it into a film. In June 1976 it was announced that Fenady's book would be published next January and that a film version would follow. \\"Whatever the author had in mind does not come off very well,\\" wrote the book critic of The New York Times, adding \\"the conception and writing are pretty sophmoric.\\" The Los Angeles Times said Fenady \\"writes well\\". The book was popular enough for a sequel The Secret of Sam Marlow: The Further Adventures of the Man with Bogart's Face. Production Fenday took the film to Mel Simon who agreed to provide $4 million. Fenady says he wound up not needing all that money and returned $400,000 to Simon. \\"I'm a Depression baby, I don't believe in wasting money,\\" he said. The film was made in May 1979 with independently raised finance from Melvin Simon Productions. In September 1979, when the movie was in post production, 20th Century Fox agreed to pick up all Melvin Simon's movies made in 1979 and 1980 in a deal worth an estimated $10 million. They had a fifty percent interest in Bogart, meaning Fox paid Simon $2 million. Star Robert Sacchi was noted for his resemblance to Bogart, and had appeared as Bogart in various roles for over a decade, including various commercials, a Broadway production of Play It Again Sam. He had toured America for four years in a one man show Bogie's Back. \\"I'm just a working guy trying to make an honest living,\\" he said. \\"I look the way I do and I always have, and there's not much I can do about it. I never had plastic surgery or wore makeup to look like Bogie.\\" Fenady said he cast another actor in the role until Sacchi walked in, after which the producer \\"went into shock. Bob doesn't need to do an impersonation. The physical impact is enough. When he began talking, I knew I had Bogart.\\" During the filming of one scene, a boat hit John Wayne's converted minesweeper. It was the last film for George Raft. Reception The film debuted at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival and was released in Europe before debuting in the US. The New York Times called it \\"an intelligent, amiable and often amusing spoof of Humphrey Bogart and the roles he played\\" although \\"everyone is so cool that there are moments when the picture seems about to drift off the screen.\\" Notes * The name Sam Marlowe is taken from two film characters played by Bogart: Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon and Philip Marlowe in The Big Sleep. * Appearing in this film are screen veterans George Raft (in his last film role), Jay Robinson, Henry Wilcoxon, Victor Sen Yung (who had appeared with Humphrey Bogart in Across the Pacific), Victor Buono, Yvonne De Carlo, Mike Mazurki, and Franco Nero. * The film won the first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song for \\"The Man with Bogart's Face\\".

The squadron is assigned to the 732d Operations Group, operating General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper. As the 430th Bombardment Squadron it saw combat with the 502d Bombardment Group in the closing months of World War II, flying from Northwest Field, Guam, earning a Distinguished Unit Citation. It remained in the Pacific until it was inactivated on 15 April 1946. HistoryWorld War I= The first predecessor of the squadron was established as the 44th Aero Squadron at Camp Kelly, Texas in June 1917, shortly after the United States' entry into World War I. The squadron moved to Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio in August apparently serving as a flying training unit with Standard SJ-1, Curtiss JN-4, and possibly Dayton-Wright DH-4 aircraft. When Air Service training units were reorganized as lettered field squadrons in 1918, the squadron became Squadron K (later Squadron P), Wilbur Wright Field, Ohio. The squadron was demobilized in April 1919. =Inter war years= The second predecessor of the squadron was organized in June 1922 as the 44th Squadron (Observation) at Post Field, Oklahoma, where it flew Dayton-Wright DH-4 and evidently Douglas O-2 aircraft conducting training with the Field Artillery School. The two squadrons were consolidated in 1924, with the consolidated unit retaining the name 44th Observation Squadron. In June 1927, the squadron moved to March Field, California, where it was inactivated at the end of July. Reactivated in the Panama Canal Zone in April 1931. It was the sole reconnaissance unit in the Canal Zone at the time, flying light reconnaissance aircraft over both approaches of the canal. The 44th was the first Air Corps unit to occupy Albrook Field after it opened in 1932–33. =World War II=Caribbean defense It was redesignated as the 44th Reconnaissance Squadron on 1 September 1937, had the suffix designation (Medium Range) added on 6 December 1939 and, on 20 November 1940 this was changed to (Heavy). The status of the unit changed from \\"assigned\\" to \\"attached\\" to the 16th Pursuit Group from 1 February 1940. Later, on 20 November 1940, the unit was attached to the 9th Bombardment Group. The Squadron had been among the first Canal Zone-based units to re-equip with the Douglas B-18 Bolo, which joined the unit as early as December 1938, although several veteran Thomas-Morse O-19C biplanes were still rendering good service as well. In June 1941, the Squadron began to receive Boeing B-17B Flying Fortresses from units in the United States upgrading to the C or D models. The Squadron moved from Albrook to Howard Field on 8 July, ending its nine-year stint at Albrook. There, with five B-18s, one B-18A and the B-17B, the Squadron commenced long range reconnaissance training in earnest. 44th Reconnaissance Squadron Martin B-10B The assignment to Howard Field was short lived and the squadron moved to Atkinson Field, British Guiana on 27 October 1941, the move didn't actually transpire until 4 November, the attachment to the 9th Bomb Group (H) continuing. Unfortunately, conditions at Atkinson were not adequate to support the B-17B, and it was left behind in Panama, being transferred to the 7th Reconnaissance Squadron prior to the unit's departure. From British Guiana, the squadron operated as an element of the infant Trinidad Base Command at Atkinson Field. In late 1941, with the coming of war, the unit immediately commenced far-ranging patrols with its remaining three B-18's and, now, two B-18A's. The attachment to the 9th Bomb Group became a formal assignment on 25 February 1942, and, by mid-February, following an accident to one of its B-18s and severe maintenance problems with the other aircraft (one other B-18 and two B-18As), the Squadron could count only one B-18A as airworthy and ready for action. The unit commander also reported that he had \\"no fully combat trained crews,\\" and, considering that this was the only Air Corps unit at Atkinson at the time, things had deteriorated dangerously. Apparently there was a recognition of this dire situation within the squadron for, on 22 April 1942, the unit was reorganized entirely as the 430th Bombardment Squadron. Training unit Later that year, the 430th returned to the United States, being assigned as a B-17 Flying Fortress training unit at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics in Florida. At the end of March 1944, with the closing of heavy bomber training, the squadron was redesignated a Very Heavy bomber squadron and assigned to Second Air Force for B-29 Superfortress conversion training at Dalhart Army Air Field, Texas. Initially equipped with B-17 Flying Fortresses for training, due to shortage of B-29s. Combat in the Pacific After completion of training the squadron deployed to the Central Pacific Area, where it became part of XXI Bomber Command at Northwest Field (Guam) for operational missions. B-29Bs were standard production aircraft stripped of most defensive guns to increase speed and bomb load, The tail gun was aimed and fired automatically by the new AN/APG-15B radar fire control system that detected the approaching enemy plane and made all the necessary calculations. The mission of the squadron was the strategic bombardment of the Japanese Home Islands. Entered combat on 16 June 1945 with a bombing raid against an airfield on Moen. Flew first mission against the Japanese home islands on 26 June 1945 and afterwards operated principally against the enemy's petroleum industry. Flew primarily low-level, fast attacks at night using a mixture of high-explosive and incendary bombs to attack targets. Flew last combat mission on 15 August 1945, later flew in \\"Show of Force\\" mission on 2 September 1945 over Tokyo Bay during formal Japanese Surrender. Inactivated on Guam 15 April 1946, personnel returned to the United States and aircraft sent to storage in Southwest United States. =Unmanned vehicle operations= The squadron returned to its designation of 44th Reconnaissance Squadron when it was activated at Creech Air Force Base, Nevada on 1 April 2015 to fly unmanned aerial vehicles in the reconnaissance role.

Site description A view of Sinja Valley on the way to Mugu The valley houses the ancient capital city of the Khasas that ruled this area from the 12th to the 14th Century. Palaces, temples, and the ancient remains of a settlement were uncovered during excavations spearheaded by the Department of Archaeology at Cambridge University. Major finds from the site include a large network of underground pipes that formed a complex water delivery system as well as a ring of massive monolithic stone columns circumscribing the settlement.Sinja valley - UNESCO World Heritage Centre On the cliffs at the valley edge were found some of the earliest written examples of Nepali language. History The Khasa kingdom fragmented into twenty-two individual kingdoms after the 14th century, which then remained until Nepal was unified in the 18th century. The founder of Sinja valley was Nagraj. Across from the Hima River there are caves with ancient votive Buddhist chaityas and cliff inscriptions. Even today the ancient rites of the Masto (Shamans) are practiced in many of the stone Dewals or temples. The Sinja Valley was where the Nepali language originates from and the earliest examples of the Devanagari script from the 13th Century were found on the cliffs and in nearby Dullu.

It was the oldest educational radio program in America. Based in San Francisco, California, the series was carried on NBC radio stations and via syndication. The Standard School Broadcast was devoted to music and American history. Carmen Dragon was music director of the programs for many years. The program's sponsor, Standard Oil of California, was honored with a Peabody Award for the series in 1958. In 1975, the program received the Peabody Institutional Award \\"for 47 years of continuous educational radio service\\". History The Standard School Broadcast began in October 1928 and was first heard in 72 schools via the NBC Pacific Network. Predating the comparable CBS Radio series The American School of the Air, it was the oldest educational radio program in the United States. The series presented hundreds of topics including the science of music, music as drama, and non-classical forms including jazz and folk. Guests ranged from Dorothy Warenskjold to Louis Armstrong. It evolved from a simple lecture program accompanied by a string trio into a program that combined concert hall, stage and documentary, with a symphony orchestra conducted by Carmen Dragon and a cast of professional performers. The Standard School Broadcast was a companion to the classical music radio program, The Standard Hour. Both were sponsored by Standard Oil of California. The Standard School Broadcast ran on NBC radio and, later, in syndication on the West Coast. A 1943 brochure shows that the programs were carried on KPO in San Francisco, KFI in Los Angeles, KMJ in Fresno, KGW in Portland, Oregon, KOMO in Seattle, Washington, KHQ in Spokane, Washington, KMED in Medford, Oregon, KDYL in Salt Lake City, Utah, KTAR in Phoenix, Arizona, KGLU in Safford, Arizona, KVOA in Tucson, Arizona, and KYUM in Yuma, Arizona, on Thursday at 10 a.m. Pacific time and 11 a.m. Mountain time. At that time, Carl Kalesch was the music director for the programs and John Grover was the announcer. The theme music for The Standard School Broadcast, as well as The Standard Hour, was \\"This Hour Is Yours\\". The theme was composed by Julius Haug, a violinist in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. \\"It was simple theme music, 45 seconds long,\\" wrote radio historian John Dunning, \\"and listeners who loved it and requested 'the entire piece' were surprised when told there was no more.\\" For many years, the broadcasts originated from NBC's largest radio studio in San Francisco. in the building which housed the network's KPO (later renamed KNBC and then KNBR).. Retrieved 2014-07-19. Besides John Grover, announcers for the broadcasts included Hale Sparks and Fred Jorgenson. Many of the programs were preserved on transcription discs or magnetic tape. Accolades In 1958, The Standard School Broadcast received a Peabody Award for radio education, \\"in recognition of continuous expansion and development over a 30-year period. This outstanding music appreciation series for schools combines educational value with highest musicianship, expert production, and utilization of appropriate musical groups of all types, instrumental and vocal.\\" In 1975, The Standard School Broadcast received the Peabody Institutional Award: > The Standard School Broadcast's 47 years on the air throughout the Western > states is an achievement to which any broadcaster could point with pride.

Facts In R. v. Saunders (1996), Ernest Saunders was convicted on twelve of fifteen counts of conspiracy, false accounting and theft relating to share dealing that occurred in 1986. During the investigation the police relied on section 434(5) of the Companies Act 1985, which made it an offence to refuse to answer questions posed by Inspectors appointed by the Department of Trade and Industry, and provided that the answers to such questions would be admissible in court (unlike earlier acts (e.g. s.31 Theft Act 1968 or s.72 Supreme Court Act 1981) where the exclusion of the right to avoid self-incrimination was tied to a provision that the answers could not be used in evidence). Giving Saunders the option of either incriminating himself or \\"the court may punish the offender in like manner as if he had been guilty of contempt of the court.\\" Saunders did answer questions during nine interviews from February to June 1987 and his answers were presented during his trial in 1989-90; the role of this specific evidence in securing his conviction is not clear. The legality of the statements obtained under compulsion was challenged at the trial under sections 76 and 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 during two occasions when the court was held a voir dire. During the later trial of his co-defendants the interviews were also subject to a challenge of abuse of process. None of these legal challenges succeeded. JudgmentCourt of Appeal= The case went to the Court of Appeal where it was rejected on 16 May 1991, with the court referring to the earlier dismissal (R. v. Seelig) regarding the legality of the interviews; leave to appeal was refused by the House of Lords. In December 1994 the Home Secretary referred the case to the Court of Appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Again the applicant argued that the use at trial of answers given to the DTI Inspectors rendered the proceedings unfair. The Court rejected this argument, deciding that Parliament had clearly provided in the 1985 Act that answers given to DTI Inspectors may be admitted in evidence even though such admittance might override the privilege against self- incrimination. Saunders had also appealed to the ECtHR, lodging his application on 20 July 1988. =European Court of Human Rights= By a majority of 16-4 the ECtHR found that there was a breach of Article 6. The court rejected the argument of the British government that the complexity of large fraud cases and the public interest in securing a conviction justified the compulsion; the court also rejected the argument that power of a trial judge to exclude admissions was a defence in this case. The court stated that \\"the public interest cannot be invoked to justify the use of answers compulsorily obtained in a non-judicial investigation to incriminate the accused during the trial proceedings\\" and \\"the prosecution in a criminal case [must] seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused.\\" Saunders was awarded damages of £75,000, which was paid in June 1997. But this was tempered by: \\"[the right to not self-incriminate] does not extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material which may be obtained from the accused through the use of compulsory powers but which has an existence independent of the will of the suspect such as , inter alia, documents acquired pursuant to a warrant, breath, blood and urine samples and bodily tissue for the purpose of DNA testing.\\" The court also stated that \\"[it was not making a judgement on] whether the right not to incriminate oneself is absolute or whether infringements of it may be justified in particular circumstances.\\" One of the dissenting judges (Mr. S. K. Martens) pointed out that the court was, in effect, over-ruling the judgement made in Funke v. France, in that it found the prosecution's use of answers given by the defendant unfair, but that the use of documents obtained from the defendant by compulsion was acceptable. While the judgement appeared decisive the caveats reduced its impact on English law as the majority of affected statutes do not contain any ambiguity over the treatment of information given under compulsory examination. Section 434 was amended in a Schedule to the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999. When Saunders was returned to the Court of Appeals it was held that the wording of section 434 did not allow for the exclusion of evidence solely on the grounds it was obtained under compulsion (R v. Saunders (1996) 1 Cr. App. R. 463), it was confirmed that \\"Parliament's clear intention... must defeat Convention jurisprudence.\\"Mirfield, Peter, 'Silence, Confessions and Improperly Obtained Evidence', Clarendon Press Oxford, 1998; p. 308 Further in British law Brown v. Stott (2003) allowed the admission of answers obtained by compulsory questioning under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, apparently in direct opposition to the ECtHR's ruling. During the ECtHR's deliberations the following case law was considered Deweer v. Belgium, Funke v. France, Fayed v. United Kingdom, John Murray v. United Kingdom.

The holder of the Premio Satira Politica Forte dei Marmi a prize for Political Satire in the sculpture section of a national competition held in Tuscany, he has also organised numerous exhibitions himself in Italy, in various institutional contexts. He's also the author of various works on humor, several of which have been published by the press of Marco Valerio Edizioni of Torino.  Biographical notes Raffaele Palma is an author with a solid artistic formation, having graduated at Turin's Fine Arts Institute, Accademia di Belle Arti di Torino, where he studied the works of several outstanding painters. As well as having published numerous works, he has curated many exhibitions and shows, which have contributed in Italy to the development of new innovations in the field of humor in the visual arts. Raffaele Palma is also an eclectic educator, and in 1984, together with Giorgio Cavallo, another Italian social satirist, he founded in Turin the CAUS – Centro Arti Umoristiche e Satiriche, Centre of Humorous and Satirical Arts. Institutional and social commitments Raffaele Palma was one of the first people in Italy to develop national interest in the themes of Comedy and Humor as sources of wellbeing and health, as well as means of resolving psychological and social conflicts, especially in the context of public institutions. In April 1989 he organised the important Workshop Sorriso e Salute (Say \\"Cheese!\\" and stay Healthy) under the patronage of the Ordine Nazionale dei Medici and the Ordine Nazionale dei Farmacisti, the Italian Registers of Doctors and Pharmacists, at Turin's Centro Incontro. On the same theme, he also organised seminars on \\"Laughter as Therapy\\" at Turin Medical School's Institute of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapy, Facoltà di Medicina di Torino, Istituto di Farmacologia e Terapie Sperimentali. He's also taught Humor and Satire for degree courses at Turin University Education Faculty, Facoltà di Magistero di Torino, and has been a consultant on humor for the City of Turin Education Department, Assessorato all'Istruzione, Comune di Torino, where he organised courses to update teachers during the 1980s and 1990s. Calligraphy Another of his interesting fields of enquiry, unfortunately neglected by the media, is his reawakening of interest in Calligraphy in many workshops, meetings and exhibitions he has organised to explore the design, of alphabets, initials, numbers and trade marks with links to the local area. At present, he runs courses in Calligraphy in Turin schools of every type and level, as well as organising a calligraphic workshop: L'Arte degli Amanuensi, The Scribe’s Art, at Unitre – Università della Terza Età a Turin further education institute for the elderly. Several of his books on humor have been published in Italy by Marco Valerio Edizioni.

They participated in battles such as Pea Ridge, Second Manassas, Antietam, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and in Federal assaults on Petersburg. They were found in the Eastern, Western, and Trans-Mississippi Theaters. At the outbreak of the war, for example, most Cherokees sided with the Union, but they soon allied with the Confederacy. Native Americans fought knowing they might jeopardize their sovereignty, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War. Overview Ely S. Parker was a Union Civil War Colonel who wrote the terms of surrender between the United States and the Confederate States of America.Ely Parker Famous Native Americans Parker was one of two Native Americans to reach the rank of brigadier general during the Civil War. Many Native American tribes fought for either side in the war including: the Delaware, Catawba, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Huron, Iroquois Confederacy, Kickapoo, Lumbee, Odawa, Ojibwe (Chippewa), Osage, Pamunkey, Pequot, Powhatan, Potawatomi, Seminole and Shawnee. Like other American communities, some tribes had members fighting on both sides of the war. During November 1861, the Creek, Black Creek Indians, and White Creek Indians of their tribe were led by Creek Chief Opothleyahola, fought three pitched battles (Battle of Round Mountain), Chad Williams, \\"Battle of Round Mountain\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. and the Battle of Chusto- TalasahMichael A. Hughes, \\"Battle of Chusto-Talasah.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. and the Battle of Chustenahlah Michael A. Hughes, \\"Battle of Chustenahlah,\\" \\"'Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. against Confederate troops and other Native Americans that joined the Confederates to reach Union lines in Kansas, and offer their services. Some Civil War battles occurred in Indian Territory. The First Battle of Cabin Creek occurred July 1–2, 1863, along the Grand River in modern-day Mayes County, Oklahoma which involved the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry. The Confederate force was led by General Stand Watie. A second battle was fought near the same location on September 19, 1864. This time the Union forces under Major Henry M. Hopkins were defeated by a Confederate force under Brigadier Generals Richard Gano and Stand Watie. This was the last major battle of the Civil War in Indian Territory. Steven L. Warren, \\"Battles of Cabin Creek,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History The Delaware demonstrated their \\"loyalty, daring and hardihood\\" during the attack of the Wichita Agency, or the Tonkawa Massacre in October 1862. A minor skirmish, Union Native Americans attacked Confederate Native Americans, and also killed five Confederate agents, took the Rebel flag and $1200 in Confederate currency, 100 ponies, and burned correspondence along with the Agency buildings. The Cherokee Nation had an internal civil war. The Nation divided, with one side led by Principal Chief John Ross and the other by renegade Stand Watie. Chief John Ross wanted to remain neutral throughout the war, but Confederate victories at First Manassas and Wilson's Creek forced the Cherokee to reassess their position. Stand Watie, along with many Cherokee, sided with the Confederate Army, in which he was made Colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee. Reluctantly, on October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the U.S. Government to the Confederate States. In the treaty, the Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools and other goods, as well as a delegate to the Confederate Congress at Richmond. In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory. As a result of the Treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7–8, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the Union forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, Federal troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the Union army. In his absence, Col. Stand Watie was chosen principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. He immediately drafted all Cherokee males aged 18–50 into Confederate military service. Watie was a daring cavalry rider who was skilled at hit-and-run tactics. He was considered a genius in guerrilla warfare and the most successful field commander in the Trans-Mississippi West. Promoted to brigadier general in May 1864, Watie was placed in charge of the Indian Cavalry Brigade, which was composed of the 1st and 2nd Cherokee Cavalry and battalions of Creek, Osage and Seminole. He achieved one of his more notable raids in the ambush of the steamboat J.R. Williams, which was bound for Fort Gibson. at Pleasant Bluff on the Arkansas River, near the present-day town of Tamaha, Oklahoma, on June 10, 1864, capturing the steamboat and its supplies, valued at $120,000. At the Second Battle of Cabin Creek (Indian Territory), Watie's cavalry brigade captured 129 supply wagons and 740 mules, took 120 prisoners, and left 200 casualties. The Cherokee who had not been removed were also caught in the middle of the Civil War. Some chose to side with the Confederate Army since they were located in the southern states. The Thomas Legion, an Eastern Band of Confederate Cherokee, led by Col. William Holland Thomas, fought in the mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina. Another 200 Cherokee formed the Junaluska Zouaves. Nearly all Catawba adult males served the South in the 5th, 12th and 17th South Carolina Volunteer Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia. They distinguished themselves in the Peninsula Campaign, at Second Manassas, and Antietam, and in the trenches at Petersburg. A monument in Columbia, South Carolina, honors the Catawbas' service in the Civil War. As a consequence of the regiments' high rate of dead and wounded, the continued existence of the Catawba people was jeopardized. 1st Michigan Sharpshooters resting In Virginia and North Carolina, the Pamunkey and Lumbee chose to serve the Union. The Pamunkey served as civilian and naval pilots for Union warships and transports, while the Lumbee acted as guerrillas. Members of the Iroquois Confederacy joined Company K, 5th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, while the Powhatan served as land guides, river pilots, and spies for the Army of the Potomac. During the Civil War, there was no distinction made when a Native American joined the U.S. Colored Troops. Well into the twentieth century, the word \\"colored\\" included not only African Americans, but Native Americans as well. Individual accounts revealed that many Pequot from New England served in the 31st U.S. Colored Infantry of the Army of the Potomac, as well as other U.S.C.T. regiments. The most famous Native American unit in the Union army in the east was Company K of the 1st Michigan Sharpshooters. The bulk of this unit was Ottawa, Delaware, Huron, Oneida, Potawami and Ojibwe. They were assigned to the Army of the Potomac just as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assumed command. Company K participated in the Battle of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania, and captured 600 Confederate troops at Shand House east of Petersburg. In their final military engagement at the Battle of the Crater, Petersburg, Virginia, on July 30, 1864, the Sharpshooters found themselves surrounded with little ammunition. A lieutenant of the 13th United States Colored Infantry quoted their actions as: General Ely S. Parker, a member of the Seneca tribe, created the articles of surrender which General Robert E. Lee signed at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Gen. Parker, who served as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's military secretary and was a trained attorney, was once rejected for Union military service because of his race. At Appomattox, Lee is said to have remarked to Parker, \\"I am glad to see one real American here\\", to which Parker replied, \\"We are all Americans.\\" The Cherokee Nation was the most negatively affected of all Native American tribes during the Civil War, its population declining from 21,000 to 15,000 by 1865. Despite the Federal government's promise to pardon all Cherokee involved with the Confederacy, the entire Nation was considered disloyal, and their rights were revoked. At the end of the war, Gen. Stand Watie was the last Confederate general to surrender, laying down arms two months after Gen. Robert E. Lee, and a month after Gen. E. Kirby Smith, commander of all troops west of the Mississippi. =Problems in the Midwest and West= The first photographic image of Lincoln as president The west was mostly peaceful during the war due to the lack of U.S. occupation troops. The federal government was still taking control of native land, and there were continuous fights. From January to May 1863, there were almost continuous fights in the New Mexico territory, as part of a concerted effort by the Federal government to contain and control the Apache; in the midst of all this, President Abraham Lincoln met with representatives from several major tribes, and informed them he felt concerned they would never attain the prosperity of the white race unless they turned to farming as a way of life. The fighting led to the Sand Creek Massacre caused by Colonel J. M. Chivington, of the Colorado Territorial Militia, whom settlers asked to retaliate against natives. With 900 volunteer militiamen, Chivington attacked a peaceful village of some 500 or more Arapaho and Cheyenne natives, killing women and children as well as warriors. There were few survivors of the massacre. In July 1862, settlers fought against Santee Sioux in Minnesota. Because the war absorbed so many government resources, the annuities owed to the Santee Sioux in Minnesota were not paid on time in the summer of 1862. In addition, Long Trader Sibley refused the Santee Sioux access to food until the funds were delivered. In frustration, the Santee Sioux, led by Little Crow (Ta-oya-te-duta), attacked settlers in order to get supplies. The Sioux killed 450–800 civilians. After the Sioux lost, they were tried (without defense lawyers) and many were sentenced to death. When President Lincoln found out about the incident, he immediately requested full information about the convictions. He assigned two attorneys to examine the cases and differentiate between those guilty of murder and those who simply engaged in battle. General Pope, as well as Long Trader Sibley, whose refusal to allow the Sioux access to food had been largely responsible for the war, were angered by Lincoln's failure to immediately authorize the executions. They threatened that the local settlers would take action against the Sioux unless the President allowed the executions, and they quickly tried to push forward with them. In addition, they arrested the rest of the Santee Sioux, 1,700 people, of whom most were women and children, although they were accused of no crime. On December 6, 1861, based on information he was given, Lincoln authorized the execution of 39 Sioux, and ordered that the others be held pending further orders, \\"taking care that they neither escape nor are subjected to any unlawful violence.\\" On December 26, 39 men were taken. At the last minute, one was given a reprieve. It was not until years later that information became public that two men were executed who had not been authorized for punishment by President Lincoln. In fact, one of these two men had saved a white woman's life during the fighting. Little Crow was then murdered in July 1863, the year in which the Santees were transported to a reservation in Dakota Territory. Native Americans in the Confederate Army At the beginning of the American Civil War, Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to the Native Americans. Native Americans served in both the Union and Confederate military during the American Civil War. Many of the tribes viewed the Confederacy as the better choice due to its opposition to a central federal system which lacked a respect for the sovereignty of Indian nations. In addition, some Native American tribes, such as the Creek and the Choctaw, were slaveholders and found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy. At the beginning of the war, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, Confederate States of America citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole, Catawba, and Creek tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. =Cherokee=Cherokee in the Trans Mississippi Theater Stand Watie, along with many Cherokee, sided with the Confederate Army, in which he was made colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee. On October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the U.S. Government to the Confederate States. In the treaty, the Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools and other goods, as well as a delegate to the Confederate Congress at Richmond. In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory. As a result of the treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7–8, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the Union forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, Federal troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the Union army. North Carolina Cherokee in the Western Theater William Holland Thomas, the only white chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, recruited hundreds of Cherokees for the Confederacy, particularly for Thomas' Legion. The Legion, raised in September 1862, fought until the end of the war. =Choctaw= Choctaw Confederate battalions were formed in Indian Territory and later in Mississippi in support of the southern cause. Choctaw in the Trans Mississippi Theater CSA. The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Creeks, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that \\"with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp and garrison equippage was furnished to any of them.\\" Albert Pike negotiated several treaties with Native American tribes, including the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms, covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, Confederate States of America citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. In Choctaw Nation in Indian Territory, Jackson McCurtain, who would later become a district chief, was elected as representative from Sugar Loaf County to the National Council in October 1859. On June 22, 1861, he enlisted in the First Regiment of Choctaw and Chickasaw Mounted Rifles. He was commissioned captain of Company G under the command of Colonel Douglas H. Cooper of the Confederate Army. In 1862 he became a lieutenant colonel of the First Choctaw Battalion. The Choctaw probably owned over 2,000 slaves. Mississippi Choctaw in the Western Theater In 1862, John W. Pierce created and financed his 1st Choctaw Battalion. The battalion was headquartered at Newton Station, Mississippi in the early part of 1863. They were sent to rescue and assist surviving train crash victims on the Chunky Creek/River on February 19, 1863. After their rescue efforts, the Indian battalion tracked deserters in central Mississippi. When a massive federal expedition (out of New Orleans) was sent to Ponchatoula, Louisiana, the 1st Choctaw Battalion was sent as reinforcement for the Battle of Ponchatoula. The 1st Choctaw Battalion, identified as \\"Indian troops,\\" was given credit for pushing back the \\"yankees\\" in southern newspapers. Not long after the battle, over half of the Choctaw soldiers deserted the battalion. After their desertion, Brigadier General John Adams recommended that the battalion be disbanded. On May 9, 1863, the 1st Choctaw Battalion was disbanded. However, a number of 1st Choctaw Battalion members remained. Another federal expedition (once again out of New Orleans) surprised the 1st Choctaw Battalion remnant. Some were captured just north of Ponchatoula. Fourteen Indian prisoners were sent to New York. They were incarcerated at Castle Williams during the entire summer of 1863. On occasion, the prisoners were showcased as entertainment for New Yorkers. Two died at a hospital on Governor's Island. At the end of summer, the remaining members were sent back to New Orleans where they were never heard from again. When members of the disbanded 1st Choctaw Battalion heard about the prisoners being sent to New York, they held a war council and drew a petition to be transferred to Samuel G. Spann's independent scouts. A delegation was sent to Richmond, Virginia, and the petition was granted. Spann's Battalion was headquartered in Mobile and, later, Tuscaloosa. The Indians remained with Spann until the end of the War. Native Americans in the Union Army Native Americans swearing in for the American Civil War. The Delaware tribe had a long history of allegiance to the U.S. government, despite removal to the Wichita Indian Agency in Oklahoma and the Indian Territory in Kansas. On October 1, 1861 the Delaware people proclaimed their alliance to the Union. A journalist from Harper's Weekly described them as being armed with tomahawks, scalping knives, and rifles. In January 1862, William Dole, U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, asked Native American agents to \\"engage forthwith all the vigorous and able-bodied Native Americans in their respective agencies.\\" The request resulted in the assembly of the 1st and 2nd Indian Home Guard. In Oklahoma, much of the Creek peoples sided with the Union. The majority of the Creek initially sided with the Union as two-thirds of the people preferred to be guided by the advice of their chief Opothleyahola. However, former Chief McIntosh sided with the South, whose leaders appointed him a colonel in the Confederate Army. =New York= Early in the war, acceptance of Native Americans in the Union Army was uneven. In New York State, prominent Natives such as Peter Wilson, Eli Parker and his brother, Newton were rebuffed when they sought to volunteer, but in October 1861, 25 Saint Regis Mohawk enrolled in the 98th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Ultimately at least 162 and as many as 300 New York natives served the Union. Newton Parker enlisted in June 1862 as a non-commissioned officer in the 53rd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and later transferred to Company D of the 132nd New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, known as the Tuscarora Company, and grant was commissioned as assistant adjutant general of volunteers on the staff of John E. Smith, a division general under Ulysses S. Grant, with the rank of captain on May 25, 1863, although never put in command of infantry.Armstrong, William H. Warrior in Two Camps: Ely S. Parker, Union General and Seneca Chief. Syracuse University Press, 1990. p80-83 Aftermath Cherokee confederates (Thomas' Legion) at the U.C.V reunion in New Orleans, 1903. Native American communities were totally devastated by the War. The Trans Mississippi Theater saw the Native Nations reduced to rubble. Historians claim they were hardest hit of all who participated in the War. Of the 3,530 Native Americans who fought for the Union, 1,108 were killed, an incredibly high rate. In the Western Theater, the Mississippi Choctaw were ignored and forgotten for nearly twenty years. It wasn't until 1900 when Samuel G. Spann began writing about his wartime experiences that the Mississippi Choctaw got some acknowledgment. Spann later commanded a U.C.V. camp in Mississippi. The Florida Seminole's recognition during the War was barely recorded. The North Carolina Cherokee was well remembered for their role. They created a U.C.V. Camp. South Carolina's Catawba erected a memorial in honor of their deeds. Most tribes among Indigenous nations were negatively affected by the Civil War. In particular, the Creeks and the Cherokees suffered devastating losses. The Cherokee nation was the most implicated Indigenous nation in the Civil War, whether on the Union side or the Confederacy. During the Creeks’ and Cherokees’ first two months in the war, almost 300 died in Kansas while around 4,000 were killed overall by the end of December 1861. By the end of the first summer of the war, more than one tenth of the Creeks deceased, which was a similar death rate compared to most other tribes. As a result of the war, the conditions of many refugees still seeking help remained disastrous for many months after the end of the war. Many of those refugees suffered from starvation. Overall, the Cherokee nation suffered more losses than any other Indigenous tribe. As a result of the war, many Cherokees were forced to flee the nation and head towards foreign lands for safety and survival. Around 22% of the Cherokee nation perished during the war. Many children were severely affected psychologically as they watched their family members get brutally killed or die of deplorable conditions. Among the Cherokees, about 35% of adult females were left as widows and a large percentage of children became orphans. Besides the enormous death toll, a huge amount of land was lost and the plentiful crops and livestock once grown were completely gone. Many who survived were considered “homeless refugees.” Nearly all structures in the nation were destroyed and the only option left was to rebuild.Crowe, Clint. \\"War in the Nations: The Devastation of a Removed People during the American Civil War.\\" Order No. 3361692 University of Arkansas, 2009.

It is a stone Federal style house built in 1832. Mary Van Duzer was the granddaughter of Isaac Van Duzer, one of Cornwall's early settlers and landowners. The farm she built with her husband was the southern tip of her grandfather's original landholdings. It remained in her family until 1903. In 1996 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Property There are two contributing resources to the NRHP listing: the house and a neighboring root cellar built into the slope behind it. Both are located at the front of the property, which extends to the Metro-North Port Jervis Line tracks to the rear traversing Schunemunk Mountain. The house is two stories high and five bays wide. It is faced in coursed fieldstone, quoined at the corners with larger stones. A cornice runs around the entire gabled roof, shingled in wood with a brick chimney at the north. The windows have brownstone sills and lintels in front and brick surrounds on the north elevation, consistent with a brick addition on that side. On the south is a flat-roofed porch supported by five wooden columns, running the entire length of that side. A portico, with ten square wood columns, Tuscan capitals, a pent roof and slate-tiled floor shelters the main entrance. Above the central window on the second story is a small stone with \\"1832\\" engraved into it. The paneled wooden door leads into a center hall. Surrounding rooms have many intact original features and woodwork, including two Adamesque mantels supported by fluted pilasters. Upstairs, the bedrooms also contain much original finishing and trim. History Before marrying William Sayer in 1831, Mary Van Duzer obtained the farm parcel from her father Henry. It was the southern end of her grandfather's original holdings, by then mostly subdivided and sold. The house was built the next year and the couple operated the farm and raised their family. The former did well enough that the Orange County Agricultural Society considered it a prize farm in 1841. Sayer is listed as the property owner as late as 1859. In 1875, the owner was an A.J. Sayer, and then in 1903 Margaret Scott. It has remained a private residence throughout its existence.

Oil on canvas. 237 x 527.5 cm. ca. 1765. Museo Nacional de Arte, Mexico. An English translation of the inscription is found on the article on painter José de Páez Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá was one of the Spanish missions in Texas. It was established in April 1757, along with the Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, later renamed Presidio of San Sabá, in what is now Menard County. Located along the San Saba River, the mission was intended to convert members of the Lipan Apache tribe. Although no Apache ever resided at the mission, its existence convinced the Comanche that the Spanish had allied with the Comanche's mortal enemy. In 1758 the mission was destroyed by 2,000 warriors from the Comanche, Tonkawa, Yojuane, Bidai and Hasinai tribes. It was the only mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by Native Americans. The Indians did not attack the nearby presidio. In retaliation, the Spanish government authorized an expedition in 1759 to attack the Comanche. Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla led over 500 Spanish soldiers and Apache braves into Comanche territory. Along the Red River, Spanish soldiers encountered a Wichita village which had been heavily fortified, complete with a moat and wooden stockade. The Indians lured Ortiz into an ambush and after a four-hour battle in which the Spanish suffered 19 dead, he and his troops retreated, leaving two cannon in the hands of the Indians.\\"Twin Villages, Battle of the. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/T/TW005.html , accessed 22 Feb 2012 To commemorate the destruction of Santa Cruz de San Sabá, the benefactor commissioned a painting in 1762, completed in 1765 (illustration). This became the first work of art to depict a historical event in Spanish Texas. A historical marker was erected near the site of the mission, and archaeological excavations were carried out in the 1990s. Background In 1716, Spanish officials authorized the settlement of the border province Spanish Texas, in the hopes of checking the influence of French missionaries and traders in neighboring Louisiana.Weber (1992), p. 160. Over the next several years, missionaries established a series of Spanish missions in Texas, ministering primarily to the Hasinai and Coahuiltecan tribes.Weber (1992), p. 163. By 1731, many of the missions were relocated to the San Antonio River, and the number of soldiers in Texas was cut to 144.Chipman (1992), p. 131. Spanish economic policies were designed to discourage its colonists from trading with other nations. All goods meant for Texas were supposed to be shipped to Veracruz and brought overland to San Antonio. The costs and difficulty of transportation made goods very expensive, making it difficult for settlers or missionaries to afford items that could be traded with, or offered as a gift to, the native tribes.Weber (1992), pp. 173-175. Native tribes were able to trade freely, and some accumulated French guns, while others traded or stole Spanish horses. Tribes without access to either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, who had been seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns.Weber (1992), p. 188. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Hasinai tribes of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of those tribes.Chipman (1992), p. 133. Over the next several decades, the Apache frequently raided Spanish settlements. The Apache also raided other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack.Anderson (1999), p. 113. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians.Chipman (1992), p. 150. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing three soldiers and four of the Indian residents.Chipman (1992), p. 151. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks.Chipman (1992), p. 152. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left.Chipman (1992), p. 153. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.Chipman (1992), p. 156. Establishment In August 1749, the Apache and Spanish agreed to peace.Chipman (1992), p. 157. The Apache began to request Spanish missions. Authorities repeatedly denied these requests, wary that the Apache were trying to gain Spanish aid in attacking the Comanches. However, the Spanish believed that if the effort was successful in converting Apaches and convincing them to remain peaceful, the missionary activity could be expanded northward. If a large enough area could become peaceful, the Spanish might be able to establish an overland route to Santa Fe. In 1752, Spanish authorities approved an expedition to explore the Apache territory and locate a site for a possible mission. The following year a small group, led by Juan Galván and including Father Miguel de Aranda, who worked at Mission Concepción, travelled northwest of San Antonio, exploring the Pedernales River, the Llano River, and the San Saba River. The San Saba River area appeared most promising as the soil was fertile, there seemed to be mineral deposits in the area, and local Apache promised to come to a mission. Galván recommended that a mission be founded along the San Saba, and that a presidio be established nearby to protect the mission against the Comanche. The viceroy ordered a second expedition of the area in 1754. Former governor of Texas Pedro de Rábago y Terán explored the same area and concurred with Galván's recommendation. The people of San Antonio were enthusiastic about the proposal, hoping that a new northern settlement would protect their town from raids. The governor still hesitated, and in 1756 asked Lieutenant Governor Bernardo de Miranda to again explore the area. While exploring, Miranda heard rumors from the Apache of silver deposits near San Sabá and again recommended the area.Chipman (1992), p. 158. The mission was established near modern-day Menard, TX In 1757, authorities finally approved the mission. For three years, the mission would be funded by local mine owner Pedro Romero de Terreros, whose cousin, Father Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, would run the mission. After three years, the government would pay mission expenses, and the government would also fund the garrison. The missions along the San Marcos River would be closed, and all of their assets would be purchased by Pedro Terreros and transferred to the new mission. Unlike most missions, this one would report to the viceroy instead of the governor. Franciscan missionaries were assigned from the College of Santa Cruz de Querétaro and the College of San Fernando de México.Chipman (1992), p. 159. Authorities had also authorized the building of a fort to protect the mission and its occupants. Missionaries were afraid that the Spanish soldiers might corrupt their converts and insisted that the fort be built away and on the other side of the river.Weber (1992), p. 189. The missionaries had divided loyalties; some supported Father Terreros, while others were angry that Terreros had been given responsibility over other priests who had long advocated for a mission to the Apaches. The commander of the garrison, Colonel Ortiz Parrilla did not approve of Terreros's appointment and also questioned the motives of the Apache. He delayed the journey several times. The missionaries, soldiers and their families left San Antonio for the San Saba River in April 1757. They brought with them 1,400 cattle and 700 sheep. There were no Apache waiting at the mission site, and after five days of searching Ortiz was unable to find any Apache. Ortiz attempted to halt the expedition, but the six missionaries refused to leave. The mission was built near modern-day Menard.Chipman (1992), p. 160. Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas was built at the same time on the other side of the river and 3 miles away as demanded by the priests. Apache representatives periodically appeared at the mission, promising that they would soon relocate to the missions, but none ever did. Three of the six missionaries returned to San Antonio. Destruction The presence of the mission infuriated Comanche leaders, who saw San Sabá as proof of an alliance between the Spanish and Apache. The Apache encouraged this perception, leaving Spanish-made items, such as shoes, behind when they raided Comanche camps. The garrison soon heard rumors that hundreds of Comanche warriors were moving towards the mission. Ortiz requested that the missionaries move into the presidio, but they refused. Because so many women and children lived in the fort, Ortiz could spare only a few soldiers to remain at the mission with the priests.Chipman (1992), p. 161. The Comanche allied with other traditional Apache enemies, including the Tonkawa and Hasinai, and on March 16, 1758, this force of about 2,000 warriors attacked the mission. According to Spanish accounts, at least half of the warriors carried European guns, an unusual event in a time when most natives fought with bow and arrow or hatchets.Weber (1992), p. 191. Eight people died, including Father Terreros, and the mission was burned to the ground. Almost every animal in the mission compound was killed, including the cattle. One missionary and about 20 other people escaped to the presidio. The Comanche gathered near the fort and tried to entice the soldiers to come outside the safety of the wooden walls. When their ploys did not work, the natives left on March 18. The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by a native attack. Response Spanish authorities were livid and determined to make a dramatic statement so that the tribes would not take advantage of perceived Spanish weakness. They chose not to disband the presidio, as that would appear to be a retreat. In January 1759, a junta met in San Antonio to determine the appropriate military response. They were unable to get significant numbers of volunteers among the citizens in Texas and neighboring Nuevo León and instead recommended that the force include soldiers, militiamen, and natives.Chimpan (1992), p. 162. The government committed 52,000 pesos to fund the expedition and the next several months were spent recruiting men. While these arrangements were being made, Comanche raided the horse herd at the San Sabá presidio, killing twenty soldiers. This event strengthened the Spanish resolve. In September, 1759, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, the commander of the garrison tasked with protecting the mission, and his 500 soldiers and Apache braves marched north into Comanche territory. On October 2 they engaged in a skirmish along the Brazos River, taking 149 natives captives. Several days later they repulsed a native attack and followed the attackers to the Red River. There, the Spanish encountered the Comanche and other tribes at a fortified village of the Taovayas, a Wichita people. The town had been surrounded by a stockade and a moat and flew a French flag. Ortiz's men were inexperienced and faced a group that had been forewarned and were well-prepared. The Spanish and Apache attacked, resulting in 52 of their group killed, wounded, or deserted. Ortiz ordered a retreat, and the group reached San Sabá on October 29. Impact The incident proved that the French had made great inroads with the Comanche and other northern tribes, and those tribes had learned European-style fighting tactics. Many Spanish officials believed that the French had instigated the attack on the mission and had helped the Comanche to prepare the village, but historian David Weber said the evidence for this charge is inconclusive. Given the superiority of Comanche numbers and the fact that the Comanche now had similar firepower to Spanish officials, many Spanish soldiers began to fear for their own safety. Several of the soldiers garrisoned at the San Sabá presidio asked for transfers, and the commander of the garrison at Presidio La Bahía wrote that \\"The enemy [is] so superior ... in firearms as well as in numbers, that our destruction seems probable.\\"quoted in Weber (1992), p. 191. Spanish officials refused to close the San Sabá presidio, ordering it rebuilt in limestone and surrounded by a moat. For the next decade, Comanche forces remained nearby, killing soldiers who ventured out in small groups. In 1769, the presidio was closed. For the next several decades, there was little attempt by the Spanish to investigate or settle in the Comanche territory. In 1762, Pedro Romero de Terreros commissioned a painting to honor his cousin who had died in the attack. The resulting The Destruction of Mission San Sabá in the Province of Texas and the Martyrdom of the Fathers Alonso Giraldo de Terreros, Joseph Santiesteban is the earliest painting known to depict a historical event in Texas.Ratcliffe (1991), p. 532. According to the Handbook of Texas, the painting is \\"the only such work executed in Mexico in the mid-1700s that attempted to document a contemporary historical event\\". The painting was the subject of some controversy in the 1980s, after United States Customs agents confiscated it in Texas and returned it to Mexico. In 1936, a historical monument was established at a site tentatively identified as the mission grounds. In 1965, archaeologists began searching for the site of the mission and in 1993 excavation began approximately from the historical monument. Over 300 Spanish artifacts were recovered.

This Buddhist pilgrimage site, which was constructed some 2500 years ago, contains relics of Gautama Buddha. History The Malla Mahajanapada Gautama Buddha's parents were from two different mahājanapadās (kingdoms) of the Solar dynasty — his father (Śuddhodana) belonged to the Shakya kingdom, while his mother (Maya) was from the Koliya kingdom. According to Buddhist texts, after Buddha's Mahaparinirvana, his cremated remains were divided and distributed among the princes of eight of the sixteen mahājanapadās. Each of the princes constructed a stupa at or near his capital city, within which the respective portion of the ashes was enshrined. These eight stupas were located at: #Allakappa, a settlement of the Bulī people. The precise location of this place is not currently known. #Kapilavastu, capital city of the Shakya kingdom (the location of this stupa is the subject of some controversy; there is evidence it was actually constructed at Piprahwa) #Kusinārā, capital city of the Malla kingdom #Pāvā, a major city of the Malla kingdom #Rājagaha a major city of the Magadha kingdom #Rāmagrāma, a major city of the Koliya kingdom (this settlement is sometimes referred to as Koliyanagara) #Vesāli, capital city of the Vajji kingdom #Veṭhadīpa, a settlement of Veṭhadīpaka Brahmins. The precise location of this place is not currently known. Some 300 years later, Emperor Ashoka opened seven of these stupas and removed the Buddha relics (his goal was to redistribute the relics into 84,000 stupas which he planned to construct throughout the Maurya Empire). According to legend, the serpent king was guarding the Ramagrama stupa, and prevented Ashoka from unearthing the relic. Current To this day, Ramagrama stupa remains the only intact and original stupa containing relics of Lord Buddha. The stupa has been an object of great reverence and pilgrimage site since its original construction. The stupa is now buried under a mound of earth and is awaiting further research.

It was designed by the Philadelphia-based architectural firm of Magaziner, Eberhard & Harris. The Uptown Theater is located on 2240 N. Broad Street. It became a major venue on the Chitlin' Circuit, from 1951–1978. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It briefly reopened as a church in the 1980s until water damage occurred and caused it to close in 1991. In 2001, the Uptown Entertainment and Development Corporation bought the building with plans for renovation. Beginnings Opened on February 16, 1929, the 2,040 seat, 50,000 square foothttp://www.philadelphiauptowntheatre.org/ Uptown Theater was built for sound, specifically the new talkies of the time, made by Warner Brothers.http://www.thesilhouettes.org/uptown-theater.htm Designed by Louis Magaziner, it featured a lavish interior, with four floors of office space above. The interior consisted of stained glass, high ceilings, and terracotta. As the industrial age peaked in America, North Philadelphia became a working man's town. A large influx of European immigrants moved to the northern part of the city, and moved into the newly developed rowhomes. In addition to the new immigrants, North Philadelphia also became the home to many fashionable mansions of the upper and upper-middle class. Executives from nearby factories lived in Victorian brownstones some with turrets and mansard roofs which lined the streets of North Philly. Along Broad Street were the grand mansions of many famed industrialists. Lower North Philadelphia in particular housed a number the nouveau riche; ambitious first or second generation immigrants or that had made their fortunes starting manufacturing firms. The theater was originally built for the nouveau riche of the area. Unknowingly, it opened up on the eve of the Great Depression, which in turn had a great effect on the neighborhood. Over the next few decades The Great Depression, outsourcing, and white flight took their toll on North Philadelphia in a fashion similar to other major US cities of the mid to late 20th century, if not in a more pronounced fashion. While some small areas had long housed primarily African- American residents, redlining, racist loan companies, and rising unemployment led white residents out of the city, and forced blacks in. Black doctors, lawyers, politicians and preachers took over the grand mansions along Diamond Street, while middle and lower class blacks moved into the rowhomes that were once predominately white.Update for the Uptown Philadelphia Weekly. June 23, 2009. The Golden Years The theater in 2014 In 1951 the Uptown Theatre was bought by Sam Stiefel, who also owned Washington's Howard Theatre and Baltimore's Royal Theatre, and became part of the \\"chitlin circuit,\\" hosting live music shows that were primarily rhythm and blues, soul, and gospel directed towards an African American audience. The performances at the Uptown Theater came to rival those at Harlem's Apollo Theater. In 1957, Georgie Woods of WDAS (AM) fame started to produce shows at the Uptown Theater. In 1960, Sid Booker became the manager of the theater, and remained so until 1979.James Spady, Georgie Woods: I'm Only a Man, pg 134 In 1961, the venue was sold by Mrs. Bert Steifel to a large chain corporation, after managing it for only two months following the death of the Steifel brothers, who owned it for many years \\"Uptown Theater Sold to Chain Corporation. \\" Philadelphia Tribune (1912-2001) 28 Feb. 1961, ProQuest Historical Newspapers =Performances= Many different types of shows went on at the venue during its prime. Usually, each show consisted of multiple artists, usually ten to twelve acts, and they performed in order of popularity. There were several performances a day, and the show usually lasted for about ten days. The first show of the day started at 2pm. The midnight performances of the show cost $2.50, while the earlier shows cost $1.50, and the kiddie matinees cost 50 cents a person.James Spady, Georgie Woods: I'm Only a Man, pg 123 Also on Thursday nights, they used to have Temple University night, in which many white students would come in and watch performances. Often enough, many patrons of the theater would hide in places such as the bathroom to see additional shows in one day. The shows themselves were very competitive in nature, with each act trying to get the biggest rise out of the crowd. Performers and audience members alike dressed up when attending shows at the theater. Performers also tried to impress each other with wowing the crowd with the best dance moves as well. Artists were not often booked for a lot of money. Georgie Woods was able to book the Supremes for $400 for a full 10-day run. Not only did musicians perform at the Uptown Theater, but comedians often opened for the acts, such as Redd Foxx and Flip Wilson. The venue itself was unique in that it had its own house band. Bill Masse was band leader of the band until he died in 1961. In 1963 Sam Reed became leader of the house band, which was well known amongst artists in the chitlin circuit. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, by 1971 the shows were grossing $250,000 a year. During the rest of the month when performers were not in town, movies usually played. There were also jazz shows where local and famous jazz performers took the stage. The shows were not characterized by the rowdy crowds that accompanied the shows promoted by Georgie Woods. The Uptown Theater was also famous for its amateur nights in which local artists would compete for various prizes. Many artists got their start in the music industry due to these amateur nights. One such person that started their career at the Uptown Theater was Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates. Hall, who attended the nearby Temple University, won a talent show playing with his then group, the Temptones. This was before pairing up with Oates. The group, backed by the James Brown Band, won the contest thus getting Hall his first record deal. =Civil rights= The theater was a hotbed for civil rights activism, especially in the form of music. Georgie Woods produced shows at the theater, called freedom shows, in which artists played to promote civil rights, and the money generated at these shows went to charities of Georgie Woods' choice, regardless of creed, color or religion. In 1967, Georgie Woods staged a special show for wounded veterans from the Vietnam War that were from the Philadelphia area. The theater also became an important landmark for civil rights in Philadelphia. Cecil Moore was a Philadelphia lawyer that was extremely involved in civil rights, and was a close friend of Georgie Woods, and was also involved in the freedom shows. In 1963, Georgie Woods, Jackie Wilson, and Del Shields won awards at the Uptown Theater from the Philadelphia branch of the NAACP for being entertainers that were actively involved in civil rights. Also, the famous 1964 Philadelphia race riot happened blocks from the theater, and when it occurred Commissioner Howard Leary had Georgie Woods come talk to and calm down the crowd, which eventually dispersed as per his request.James Spady, Georgie Woods: I'm Only a Man, pg 136 His influence on the community was so great, showed how important the Uptown Theater was for the residents of North Philadelphia. =Neighborhood= By the late 1950s, North Philadelphia was the epicenter of Philadelphia's African-American community. It was a vibrant place populated by all classes. There were dozens of factories, numerous clubs along Columbia Avenue, shops and restaurants all over the place, and the Uptown—which evolved into a mecca for live music. Many family owned businesses around the theater became popular spots for the performers and audience members alike. Many of the performers would eat at Miss Pearl's house, which was located right behind the venue on Carlisle Street. In addition to that, many of them got their hair done at Don's Doo Shop, which was and still owned by Don Williams, right around the corner on 15th Street and Susquehanna Avenue. Many of the artists stayed at the Ben Motor Inn on 22nd Street and Spring Garden. The neighborhood was often noted to be tight-knit, where many people living in the area worked in the nearby factories and knew each other by name. The area surrounding the theater was also unique in that it did not provide a lot of space for parking, so many people walked or took public transportation to the Uptown. Later years and decline Eventually, the riots and the manufacturing exodus of the 1960s occurred, and the gang wars of the 1970s. By 1978, the Uptown was too small for the major acts, in an area with high crime. In 1971, Sam Reed, who was leader of the house band in the 1960s stepped down. In December 1971, there were frequent concert gang fights that broke out. In 1972, Georgie Woods stopped producing shows at the Uptown Theater, mainly because of the drugs and violence in the surrounding neighborhood of the theater. In May 1972, shows stopped playing at all at the venue, and in 1978 the Uptown Theater ultimately closed. Other reasons led to the decline of theaters similar to the venue. The music industry had changed significantly from when the theater was in its prime. Black artists were now able to cross over, and play in venues such as ones in Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Musicians that played there were able to perform at larger venues and make more profit. Georgie Woods also stated in an interview that the existence of booking agencies made it harder to book acts because they would ask for more money.James Spady, Georgie Woods: I'm Only a Man, pg 130 There was a point in time when black artists could only be heard if they went to Georgie Woods, but once music became integrated. Also, the decline of independent record stores disabled local artists from being able to promote their music. On the other hand, music became more integrated, so many radio stations only played a sampling of rhythm and blues, as opposed to stations that used to solely play rhythm and blues. Many artists started to cross over into pop, so they were less inclined to play at theaters such as the Uptown. The neighborhood also changed dramatically. Many of the businesses started to decline because they catered to the Uptown clientele and lost them once the theater closed. The Uptown briefly reopened in the 1980s as a church. A church group held services there until a 1991 storm damaged the roof, allowing water to pucker the painted walls and corrode the gilded auditorium. After the congregation left, the only people who entered were thieves, crackheads and taggers More recently, members of the community gathered at the Uptown to mourn the death of Michael Jackson. Uptown Entertainment and Development Corporation (UEDC) The Uptown Entertainment and Development Corporation (UEDC) is a Community Development Corporation that was incorporated as a nonprofit in 1995. The mission is to stimulate the economy in blighted areas in Philadelphia by creating commercial enterprises, developing neighborhood revitalization projects and managing moderate and housing. The UEDC has identified the historic Uptown Theater as its first acquisition and revitalization project. In 2002, they became owners of the actual building. The development plans include renovating the theater into a technology center, artist lofts and office space. Proposed tenants include a faith-based institution, high school, record production facility and restaurant. The technology center will create jobs for 200 youth and adults and provide entrepreneurial opportunities for disadvantaged members of the community. The linchpin of the program strategy will be the creation of a film and media center, technology center and film stage. It will be the headquarters for the Art and Education Youth Programs, provide space for a sound studio and catering facility and house the business offices for the development corporation. The UEDC has received pledges of $3.5 million but it will take around $8 million to get the facility fully operational.Famed drummer and founder of the group, The Trammps, Earl Young serves as the Entertainment Outreach Co-Chair along with noted Musician, Alfie Pollitt. In December of 2013, the Mural Wall dedicated to Georgie Woods and the groups that performed there suffered damage due to the retaining wall separating the theater from the building once next to it. Repairs and remdiation is taking place. Additional funds are being sought to complete the wall and repaint the mural. The projected completion date is now being revised, however officials of the Uptown Entertainment and Development Corporation expect the theater to be opened before the end of 2014. In February 2018, UEDC was granted $500,000 by the Pennsylvania government for the continuation off the theatres' renovation, with a new opening date scheduled as mid-2019.

It is notable for various migratory species of pink and white flamingos. Laguna Hedionda is one of the nine small saline lakes in the Andean Altiplano. It lies at an altitude of , with an area of . Salt flats and bofedales (wetlands) are spread over the periphery of the lake. It is in a very remote area where human habitation is negligible. However, llamas and alpacas are seen grazing in the area. Geography Laguna Hedionda is located in the Cordillera Occidental area of the Bolivian Altiplano of the central Andes, which is a volcanic landscape where many small closed lake basins have been noted. The central Andes of Bolivia has two other major basins, also running in a north–south direction, namely the freshwater Lake Titicaca basin and the Poopó and the Coipasa-Uyuni basins with shallow saline lakes and/or a salt crusts. Specifically, the catchment of Laguna Hedionda borders with Chile and Argentina. It is located just north of lake Ch'iyar Quta in the central Andes mountains at an elevation of . There are several mountains within including Michincha, Cerro Volcanes, Cerro de Pajonal, Cerro de Tatio, Pabellón and Tocorpuri. Laguna Hedionda has a water surface area of . It is one of the four blue lakes that are seen on the way from the southern road that leads through Ollagüe volcano (elevation ), the only active volcano in Bolivia; the other three lakes are Cañapa, Ramaditas and Ch'iyar Quta. All the lakes are sourced by springs and have high sulphur content. The peripheral area of the lake is strewn with black volcanic rocks. Coal deposits are found near the lake. The catchment area of the lake is primarily covered with semi-desert steppe and dwarf scrub. Access to the lake is from San Juan via Chiguana which is a rail head and military post. Features Diatom studies were carried out in the lake basins of the central Andes, which included the lake in the Lípez area, to determine the past lacustrine depth based on basin morphology, stratigraphy, sediment samples, altitude and diatom ecology. From these studies, it has been inferred that the hydrology of the closed basins of the Lípez (including several lakes such as Laguna Hedionda, Cañapa, Ch'iyar Quta, Honda, Pujito, Ramaditas and Ballivian) have a direct relationship with the regional climatic conditions since their catchment area is small compared to other lakes in the Coipasa-Uyuni basin. These are shallow lakes and their chemistry and diatom flora are well assessed. The lake water has a high salinity level of 66–80% and therefore is rich in invertebrate zooplankton and benthos, such as Artemia. A survey carried out in 1979 described the presence of Artemia salina, nematodes and harpacticoids. The lake has mineral deposits of thenardite and ulexite, gypsum, lithium, boron and potassium, among others. Fauna Flamingo flying over the Laguna Hedionda Set in the backdrop of snow-covered mountains, the lake, like its neighbours, is famous for a variety of high Andean waterfowl, particularly flamingos (mostly white for the reason that algae that creates the pink colour is comparatively less in the lake waters), and other bird species such as ducks and the Andean goose, and herds of vicuña are also reported. The southern lakes in the Bolivian Altiplano including Laguna Hedionda form one of the major wintering grounds for Phalaropus tricolor followed by Phoenicopterus chilensis and Phoenicopterus jamesi. On one particular date in February 1979, Phalaropus tricolor, Phoenicoparrus jamesi, Phoenicoparrus andinus and Phoenicopterus chilensis counted in the area were about one million, out of which 500,000 were reported from Laguna Hedionda and two other lakes. Culture Hunter gatherers of the paleo-ceramic or Paleo-Indian period (8,000 BC) lived in the vicinity of the lake. Between 10,000 BC and 2500 BC, the languages spoken in the area were Uru and Choquela.

Auer, My Long Life in Music, New York, Stokes, 1923 It was published in 1862 by the firm of Fritz Simrock. The sextet is scored for two violins, two violas, and two cellos. The sextet has four movements:For instance, see pages 1–44 of the 1968-published Dover Publications reprint of the Vienna Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde Edition: Complete chamber music for strings and clarinet quintet (originally edited by Hans Gál). . The outlines of the main themes of the first movement and finale are similar (the first four notes of the cello theme of the first movement are almost identical with those of notes two to five of the finale, and there are other similarities more easily heard). In the same year of its composition, Brahms transcribed the second movement for solo piano, dedicating the arrangement to Clara Schumann. Sextet chronology There are earlier string sextets by Luigi Boccherini (two sets of six each). However, between Boccherini and Brahms, very few for string instruments without piano seem to have been written or published, whereas within the decades following Brahms's two examples, a number of composers, including Antonín Dvořák, Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Joachim Raff, Max Reger, Arnold Schoenberg, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold, all wrote string sextets. Those few examples of such sextets that appeared between the Boccherini and the Brahms include a sextuor a deux violins, deux violes, violoncelle & basse from the 1780s (still later than the 1776 or so of Boccherini's Op. 23) by Ignaz Pleyel, Ignacy Feliks Dobrzyński's Op. 39 in E (with double-bass, and published in 1848), Louis Spohr's sextet in C major (Op. 140) of 1848, and the sextet in D minor (with double bass) by Aloys Schmitt of 1852 (one other possible exception is the sextet of Ferdinand David – published in 1861 and possibly performed in 1860.See IMSLP, with recording and performance parts.) Popular culture This sextet was used as soundtrack by French director Louis Malle in the movie \\"The Lovers\\" (\\"Les Amants\\", 1958). The sextet's second movement is featured in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Sarek\\". The second movement is also featured in \\"The Day of the Dead\\", an episode of Inspector Morse, and in the 2001 French-Austrian film The Piano Teacher.

The first Nuna team (the so- called Alpha Centauri team) consisted of the following team members: Ramon Martinez, Kim de Lange, Eiso Vaandrager, Bart Goorden, Bram Soethoudt, Koen Boorsma, Annebel Borgsteede, Rosalie Puiman and Eric Trottemant. The project was sponsored by Nuon. Thanks to this financial help the team was able to finish their first car: Nuna 1. The team consisted mainly of students from the Delft University of Technology who were guided by former astronaut Wubbo Ockels. The Nuna won the World Solar Challenge in Australia in 2001; the race ran from Darwin in the north to Adelaide in the south. It was the first time that the Dutch team participated in the race. The 3021 km long race was finished in 32 hours and 39 minutes, breaking the old record by the Honda team from 1996 (33 hours and 32 minutes). The average speed was 91.8 kilometer per hour. Solar cells The car's shell was covered with the best dual-junction and triple-junction gallium-arsenide solar cells, developed for satellites. These cells had an efficiency of about 24%. The European Space Agency (ESA) was about to test these cells in space in early 2003, when the technology- demonstrating SMART-1 mission was scheduled to launch to the Moon.

In 1978, Baghdad hosted an Arab League summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the Camp David accords. However, Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation.

Corsica had been controlled by the Genoese since 1284 when they established their supremacy over the Pisans in the naval Battle of Meloria. Towards the end of the 15th century the Ottoman Turks expanded their control of the Mediterranean westwards and became a dominant maritime power in the region. In 1480 they sacked Otranto in southern Italy and in 1516 they took control of Algiers. In the first decades of the 16th century Turkish corsairs in galleys and fustas often rowed by Christian slaves began attacking villages around the Corsican coastline. Many hundreds of villagers were captured and taken away to be sold as slaves. The Genoese Republic responded by building a series of towers around the coastline. Most were built to a similar circular design with a roof terrace protected by machicolations. Nearly one hundred were constructed before the Genoese decided in around 1620 that they were unable to defend the island and abandoned the building program. In 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, British naval forces struggled to capture a Genoese tower in Corsica near the Punta Mortella, one of two towers guarding the entrance to the port of Saint- Florent. Impressed by their effectiveness and simple design, the British built many similar towers calling them Martello towers. The ruined Genoese towers are now a prominent feature of the Corsican coastline. Many have been listed as official Historical Monuments by the French Ministry of Culture. HistoryConstruction= The construction of these towers started in the 16th century, at the request of village communities to protect themselves against pirates. In 1531, the Genoese Bank of Saint George sent two extraordinary representatives, Paolo Battista Calvo and Francesco Doria, to inspect the fortifications defending the island from the Barbary corsairs. In 1531, the construction of ninety towers on the Corsican littoral was decided, thirty-two of them in the Cap Corse. The work began under the supervision of two new Genoese representatives, Sebastiano Doria and Pietro Filippo Grimaldi Podio. The objective was to extend to Corsica the system of vigilance already in force on the Mediterranean circumference. The towers performed three functions: they defended the villages and ports, they acted as landmarks for navigators and they allowed news of an attack to be rapidly signalled to other communities along the coast. An inventory of the coastal towers produced by the Genoese authorities in 1617 lists 86 towers. Two additional towers were constructed before the building program was abandoned. These were the Torra di Sponsaglia (completed in 1619) and the Torra di Sant'Amanza (completed in 1620) both in the south of Corsica between Bonifacio and Porto-Vecchio. Of these 88 towers, little or nothing survives for twenty of them. Two towers on the list were already in a ruined state in 1617: the Torra di Vignale and the Torra di Travo, both on the east coast. =Decline= The towers caused multiple problems for the Genoese authorities; their isolated locations made them prime targets for pirates and constructional defects caused collapses. Several inventories of the towers were carried out but no precise number could be determined. The Republic of Genoa also had to deal with many financial conflicts, quarrels of communities, defection of guards, unpaid debts, and requests for supplies or weapons. Consequently, from the end of the 17th century until 1768, the date of the conquest of the island by France, the number of maintained towers decreased considerably. When Pasquale Paoli was elected President of the new independent Corsican Republic in 1755, only 22 towers remained, some of which were occupied by the French troops. The continual guerrilla wars during the paolian period caused the destruction of several of these buildings, including the towers of Tizzano, Caldane, Solenzara. The battle for the landing of the British troops of the Anglo- Corsican Kingdom in 1794, ruined the towers of Santa Maria della Chiappella and Mortella. By the end of the 18th century, few towers were still intact. =Heritage= Today the Genoese towers represent a considerable heritage. Of the 85 towers existing at the beginning of the 18th century, 67 still stand today. Some are in ruins; others are in very good state. Many of them are classified as Monuments historiques. An important work of restoration, financed essentially by the local authorities although they are not owners, was produced to save some of them. Unfortunately, by lack of means and program of restoration, many of these symbols of the island continue to deteriorate. Function The garrison of a tower consisted of between two and six men (), recruited among the inhabitants and paid from the local taxes. These guards were to reside permanently in the tower. They could move away no more than two days, for the supply and the pay, and one by one. They ensured the lookout with regular fires and signals: every morning and evening they assembled on the platform, informed navigators, shepherds and ploughmen about safety, communicating by fires with the closest towers located in their sight, and supervised the arrival of possible pirates. Torra di Capiteddu: detail showing the machicolations In the event of alarm, a signal was given on the terrace at the top of the tower, in the form of smoke, fire or the sound of culombu (a large conch), warning the surroundings of the approach of hostile ships. It was followed by the general withdrawal of the people and animals in the interior of the country. The two closest towers in sight were ignited and so on, which made it possible to put the entire island in alarm in a few hours. Certain garrisons had to be defended against the invaders, and combatants’ remains were found at their bases. Thus, the famous Torra di l'Osse took its name from the bones buried along its walls. The towers were always insufficiently armed. They were used mainly as customs stations and daymarks. The torregiani often neglected their military role, to concentrate on the control of the maritime trade and the perception of various taxes. They were also trading wood and cultivating in the surrounding lands. Although unjustified absence of a guard was prohibited under penalty of galley as well as the replacement by a person other than the titular guards, as times went by, some towers were deserted. They deteriorated, fell in ruins, or were destroyed for lack of defence. Architecture Section though the Torra di a Parata The Genoese towers were constructed of stone blocks held together with mortar. Most of the towers were circular in plan although a few were square such as the Torra di Portu and the Torra di Pinareddu. The circular towers were typically in height and diameter at the base reducing to at the moulded string course marking the level of the first floor. The base contained a cistern which was fed with rain water by an internal pipe from the terrace. The vaulted room on the first floor was connected to the terrace by a staircase built into the thick exterior wall and protected at the top by a small guerite. The terrace was surrounded by a low machicolated battlement. A doorway in the side of the tower at the first floor level was reached by a removable wooden ladder. A few towers were taller at around in height and included a second internal vaulted room above the first. Examples are the Torra di a Parata near Ajaccio and the Torra di Santa Maria Chjapella in Capicorsu. The towers were manned by an officer and two or three soldiers who lived in the room on the first floor which had niches in the walls and a fireplace.

The film stars Prabhu Deva, Skandha and B. Saroja Devi in the lead roles. The movie premiered at Toronto International Film Festival in 2007. The movie screened for the first time in India on 1 December 2007 at 38th International Film Festival of India.  Overview  The film was a part of Mira Nair's noble project AIDS Jaago (AIDS Awake), a series of four short films, Prarambha (directed by Santosh Sivan, Migration (directed by Mira Nair), Positive (directed by Farhan Akhtar) and Blood Brothers (directed by Vishal Bhardwaj) in a joint initiative of Mira Nair's Mirabai Films, voluntary organisations Avahan and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with a view of generating awareness about HIV/AIDS. The film was made for Richard Gere’s AIDS foundation. The film was entirely shot on location in and around Mysore. The film, directed by Santosh Sivan, is about a truck driver (Prabhu Deva) who helps a boy (Skandha) in his quest for the person who gave him birth, and then helps get him reinstated in school, from which he had been dismissed for also being HIV-positive. Prabhu Deva, the male protagonist, plays the role of a truck driver in the film.  Plot  The story of the film begins when Puttaswamy (Prabhu Deva), a truck driver, arrives at his place in Mysore. Puttaswamy discovers a little boy Kittu (Skandha) in the back of his truck. Kittu is on a journey to find his mother (Anu Prabhakar), who left him upon discovering that she was HIV positive. The next scene involves a call-girl (played by Ramya) trying to approach Puttaswamy, but he declines her invitation and says he has stopped indulging these days. Meanwhile, she gets troubled by a thug (Sadhu Kokila), a pimp who demands money from her. When Puttaswamy tries to stop the thug, he gets thrashed by him. Suddenly a cop (Jai Jagdeesh) arrives at the place and harasses Puttaswamy for the happenings. Kittu saves him by pretending Puttaswamy is his dad, so Puttaswamy agrees to help the boy find his home. Later, he takes the boy to his home. He discovers that the lady in the house (Chitra Shenoy) is not Kittu's mother, and learns from her that Kittu's mother has been admitted to hospital. Immediately he rushes to the hospital. It turns out the mother is dying of AIDS and doesn't want to face her son. Kittu refuses to go back home and school, because he was dismissed from his school. Puttaswamy takes the boy to the house of his grandmother (Jayanthi) and promises that he will take back the boy to his school, but he finds that the school will not admit him back because the boy has contracted HIV from his parents. The Headmistress (B. Saroja Devi) tells some ignorant parents fear it may spread to their children, but she promises to the boy that she will try to take him back. The school administrators organize an awareness program and educate parents about HIV. Puttaswamy campaigns among parents to change their perceptions, until the school takes the boy back. The story ends when Kittu gets re-admitted to the school.  Cast  * Prabhu Deva - Puttaswamy Gowda (Truck Driver) * B.

His 1945 revue Sigh No More ran for only 213 performances in the West End, and the failure of his musical Pacific 1860 in 1946–47 was in contrast to the success of the show that followed it at Drury Lane, Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!, which ran for more than ten times as long. Ace of Clubs was one of several other less successful Coward works of the period.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 419–450 Cast *Elaine – Bubbly Rogers *Rita Marbury – Sylvia Cecil *Benny Lucas – Raymond Young *Sammy Blake – Robb Stewart *Felix Fulton – Myles Eason *Ace of Clubs Girls: :*Dawn O'Hara – Sylvia Verney :*Doreen Harvey – Margaret Miles :*Sunny Claire – June Whitfield :*Ruby Fowler – Erica Yorke :*Greta Hughes – Pamela Devis :*Betty Clements – Lorna Drewes :*Mimi Joshua – Vivien Merchant :*June April – Lisbeth Kearns :*Baby Belgrave – Jean Carson *Hercules Brothers – Victor Harman, Ronald Francis, Stanley Howlett *Joseph Snyder – Elwyn Brook-Jones *Gus – Patrick Westwood *Pinkie Leroy – Pat Kirkwood *Harry Hornby – Graham Payn *Clarice – Eileen Tatler *Eva – Renee Hill *Yvonne Hall – Jean Inglis *Mavis Dean – Gail Kendall *Detective-Inspector Warrilove – Jack Lambert *Policeman – Michael Darbyshire *Mr Price – Philip Rose *Mrs Price – Stella White *Juvenile delinquents – Peter Tuddenham, Colin Kemball, Norman Warwick *First plain- clothes Man – Manfred Priestley *Second plain-clothes Man – Christopher Calthrop *Drummer – Don Fitz Stanford *Waiters – George Selfe, Richard Gill, Jacques Gautier Night club habitués and visitors :Source: Theatrical Companion to Coward. Synopsis Benny runs the Soho nightclub \\"The Ace of Clubs\\" for the owner, Rita. Felix, the compère, introduces the club's girls, who perform their opening number. Benny plans the pickup of a parcel with a gangster, Smiling Snyder. The parcel is in the cloakroom wrapped in a raincoat. When Snyder forcibly steals a kiss from Pinkie Leroy, the club's star, in the middle of her act, a sailor named Harry punches Snyder, who draws his gun and fires. Pinkie takes the raincoat to cover her skimpy costume and escapes with Harry. Harry and Pinkie discover the parcel in the raincoat, but it falls out and Harry finds it after Pinkie goes back to the club. Benny is already looking for the missing parcel, and Rita, who is in love with him, realises that Benny is involved with the gangsters. At rehearsal the next afternoon, Harry comes by to see Pinkie. Detective-lnspector Warrilove arrives to investigate a jewel robbery and shooting. He suspects Snyder. Benny discourages Pinkie from becoming involved with Harry. That evening Snyder and his associate, Guy, kidnap Harry during the show, but he escapes. Pinkie, afraid for Harry's safety, promises Benny that she will get the parcel. Harry is hidden, and after Benny leaves, he and Pinkie meet. The next day, Harry return with the parcel, suggesting that they give it to the police. Pinkie disagrees, and they argue. That evening, one of the girls mistakes the parcel for her birthday present and opens it, finding the purloined necklace. Snyder and Gus pick up the parcel in exchange for cash. Rita hears that the stolen necklace has been traced to the club. She asks the gangsters to leave. In the club, Warrilove notices the necklace, which the birthday girl is wearing, and he follows her. Snyder and Gus open the parcel to find the birthday present, a pair of falsies. They return to the club, and Warrilove catches them. All ends happily for Benny and Rita as well as Pinkie and Harry.

But Mr Coward’s usual public will feel that he has temporarily deserted them.\\" The Manchester Guardian was more favourable, calling the show \\"essentially a good-tempered frolic ... unlikely to knock spots off Oklahoma but it is in essence not only more genial, but more intelligent.\\" It praised Coward's protégé Graham Payn, who \\"dances with consummate grace ... singularly fresh and boyish\\", adding, whether innocently or not, \\"Benevolent Uncle Noel has found a first-class nephew\\".

Its last assignment was with the 40th Bombardment Wing, based at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas. It was inactivated on 1 September 1964. Heraldry Emblem: On and over a blue disc edged in gold a falcon affronte in red, white, and black, outlined in yellow, with wings displayed and carrying a yellow aerial bomb. (Approved 7 February 1942) HistoryWorld War II=Antisubmarine Warfare Established in Puerto Rico, the unit was activated 1 April 1941 as the 44th Bombardment Squadron (Medium) and assigned to the 40th Bombardment Group (Medium). It trained with borrowed B-18 Bolo medium bombers and slowly received its own equipment. Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the Squadron was ordered to Panama, and arrived at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, on 5 June 1942. On 2 July 1942, the unit was redesignated as the 44th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), following the air echelon's move to Guatemala City Air Base, Guatemala on 23 June. There the unit transitioned onto Boeing B-17E Flying Fortresses and, following familiarization with the much larger and complex aircraft, were almost immediately tasked with antisubmarine patrols duties between Guatemala City and the Galapagos Islands, the third-longest patrol route ever assigned any unit of the Air Corps to that time. By 7 March 1943, still at Guatemala City, the Squadron had a mix of five B-17Es and three Consolidated B-24D Liberators. By 11 April, all of the B-17Es were transferred out and replaced by B-24Ds. The unit was moved to Howard Field, Panama Canal Zone on 19 May 1943 in preparation for its return to the United States, as the need for such a large number of bomber squadrons on the Pacific patrol routes had diminished. The unit left the Sixth Air Force on 15 June 1943. B-29 Superfortress era Assigned to Pratt Army Airfield, Kansas in July 1943, being re-manned with new personnel. Received prototype and early production- model Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers. Trained under Second Air Force for an extended period due to Boeing technicians making modifications of B-29 aircraft. Deployed to the new XX Bomber Command as part of the 58th Bombardment Wing in the China-Burma-India Theater, flying to bases in India via South Atlantic Transport route; across central Africa, Arabia to Karachi. Additional modifications of B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115 °F). From airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan. The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 Doolittle raid on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata on Kyushu by using its forward staging base at Hsinching Airfield (A-1), China, for refueling.Mann, Robert A. (2009), The B-29 Superfortress: A Comprehensive Registry of the Planes and Their Missions, McFarland, Performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, Singapore, Saigon and Cam Rahn Bay, French Indochina. Also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand Malaya and French Indochina. Advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the Northern Mariana Islands made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan. Moved to West Field on Tinian in April 1945, becoming part of the new XXI Bomber Command. From the Marianas, engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in Kure. Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area. By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the Hikari Naval Arsenal. After V-J Day, the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions. Demobilized on Tinian in 1946, aircraft being returned to the United States for storage. Inactivated as a paper unit in October. =Strategic Air Command= Reactivated in 1953 under Strategic Air Command, receiving then second-line B-29s for training and organization. Replaced the propeller-driven B-29s with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964, being one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet. Inactivated in September when the last aircraft was retired. =Operations and Decorations= * Combat Operations: Antisubmarine patrols, Dec 1941 – May 1943.

It typically lasts a little under 2 weeks, before basketball post-season play begins. The minor and mid-major conferences typically begin Championship Week and it ends on Selection Sunday with the brackets being unveiled. Over the years, more games have been added with the expansion of ESPN's numerous multicast channels. Coverage of the NCAA conference tournaments is no longer mostly limited to ESPN, since the proliferation of competing sports networks such as CBS Sports Network and Fox Sports 1, as well as CBS's longstanding over-the-air coverage of the last weekend of conference championships, all of which air similar marathons opposite Championship Week. This has allowed even further exposure of the tournaments on national television. For example, the Pac-12 tournament airs on Pac-12 Network and alternately on Fox Sports 1 and ESPN, the Big East on Fox and Fox Sports 1, and the Mountain West on CBS and CBS Sports Network. On radio, Westwood One's coverage of the conference tournaments is also billed as Championship Week. Process ESPN typically schedules the games a year in advance. Many conferences get their only nationally televised game of the year during this week. ESPN programmer Burke Magnus points out that a single change can result in a domino effect. History It began in 1986 with 27 games, not all of which were live. It cut into 45 games. This franchise was greatly expanded with the creation of ESPN2. Due to the popularity of the expanded coverage of the college basketball tournaments aired on ESPN, it was later coined Championship Week. In 1999, the two ESPN networks at the time aired 51 games, 25 of which were conference title games. In 2000, ESPN and ESPN2 aired 58 total games (men's and women's) over 8 days including 31 conference title games. Both networks aired all the games from the Big East Tournament. In 2001, there were 57 games in 9 days (25 of the 31 automatic berths). This also marked a turning point for the women's game, as their championship games were aired for the first time.

Its last assignment was with the 40th Bombardment Wing, based at Forbes Air Force Base, Kansas. It was inactivated on 1 September 1964. HistoryWorld War II=Antisubmarine Warfare The 45th Bombardment Squadron was formed at Borinquen Field, Puerto Rico, on 1 April 1941, and assigned to the newly formed 40th Bombardment Group (Medium). Its initial mission was the aerial defense of Puerto Rico and the Antilles chain of islands. Equipped with Douglas B-18 Bolos. After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, the unit was placed on full alert and all aircraft were kept armed and \\"bombed-up\\" at all times. On many occasions, the units' B-18's got off following a \\"scramble\\" on only 15 minutes notice. As the strength of Air Corps units in the Antilles grew and was augmented by Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command and Navy air assets, it became possible to re-deploy the 45th to Panama to aid the hard- pressed Pacific and Caribbean approaches patrol forces there. Accordingly, on 7 June 1942 (following its redesignation as the 45th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 7 May 1942) the Squadron departed for Panama by ship, arriving at France Field on 17 June where it was assigned LB-30 aircraft and later B-24s. Anti-submarine patrols were made over the Pacific. On 18 February 1943 the 45th Bomb Squadron was transferred to Seymour Field, Galapagos Islands. In May it moved back to Panama, being assigned to Howard Field, Panama Canal Zone. With the general wind-down in action in the Caribbean, the Squadron was moved back to the United States in May 1943.

This plane was named after Eddie Allen, a chief test pilot at Boeing Aircraft Co., who built and presented the plane to the Army Air Forces, The test pilot was killed in the second experimental B-29. Assigned to Pratt Army Airfield, Kansas in July 1943, being re-manned with new personnel. Received prototype and early production-model B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombers. Trained under Second Air Force for an extended period due to Boeing technicians making modifications of B-29 aircraft. Deployed to the new XX Bomber Command as part of the 58th Bombardment Wing in the China-Burma-India Theater, flying to bases in India via South Atlantic Transport route; across central Africa, Arabia to Karachi. Additional modifications of B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115 °F). From airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan. The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 Doolittle raid on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata on Kyushu by using its forward staging base at Hsinching Airfield (A-1), China, for refueling.Mann, Robert A. (2009), The B-29 Superfortress: A Comprehensive Registry of the Planes and Their Missions, McFarland, Performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, Singapore, Saigon and Cam Rahn Bay, French Indochina. Also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand Malaya and French Indochina. Advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the Northern Mariana Islands made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan. Moved to West Field on Tinian in April 1945, becoming part of the new XXI Bomber Command. From the Marianas, engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in Kure. Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area. By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the Hikari Naval Arsenal. After V-J Day, the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions. Demobilized on Tinian in 1946, aircraft being returned to the United States for storage. Inactivated as a paper unit in October. =Strategic Air Command= Reactivated in 1953 under Strategic Air Command, receiving then second-line B-29s for training and organization. Replaced the propeller-driven B-29s with new B-47E Stratojet swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the late 1950s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence, and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. Began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964, being one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet. Inactivated in September when the last aircraft was retired. =Operations= * Combat Operations: Antisubmarine patrols, Dec 1941 – May 1943.

As the city grew, it incorporated the culinary traditions of the municipalities it absorbed into the area now known as the Community of Madrid. The smell of local cooking is frequently compared to that of food fried in vegetable oil: churros, calamares a la romana, tortilla de patatas, bocadillos de calamares, patatas bravas, chopitos, gallinejas, among other traditional dishes, which can be smelled cooking no matter the time of day. History The culinary history of Madrid began at the end of the 16th century, when King Felipe II established Madrid as the capital city of his kingdom. From this point forward, people from all parts of the Spanish Empire flocked to the city, bringing with them their unique customs and traditions. Some of the most famous local inns were established during these early centuries of development: Posada de la Villa in 1624 and Casa Botín in 1725. One of the earliest restaurants is the Lhardy, which opened its doors in 1839, which prompted the establishment of similar locales. In 1873, entrepreneur Matias Lacasa arrived from Vienna and decided to open a bakery to sell his patented pastry pan de viena. His establishment grew to become the base of the Viena Capellanes chain of pastry shops. Today, Madrid is home to many restaurants, offering both regional Spanish dishes and international cuisine. An international culinary destination, Madrid is lauded by its foreign visitors, whose only complaint is the Spanish schedule for meals. As in much of Spain since the Francoist era, dinner is served between two and four in the afternoon, and a light supper is consumed after ten at night. Typical dishes bocadillo de calamares. A plate of patatas bravas. A skillet of carne al desarreglo. Eating tapas is common in Madrid. This is the practice of visiting several bars and ordering a number of small, varied dishes which are then shared among the people in the group. Many of the same local dishes available as tapas can also be ordered in regular servings at sit-down restaurants. Some of the most-typical local dishes include: *Cocido madrileño. A popular beef-and-vegetable stew that is frequently offered as a Tuesday special. Consisting of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), meat (usually beef), vegetables, and sausage, the dish is served in three courses. The first course consists of a broth-based soup, the second includes the beans and vegetables, and the final course contains the meat and sausage. *Callos a la madrileña. A local variation of the Asturian dish, this tripe-based dish is made with chorizo, blood sausage, the hoof and snout of a cow, sweet paprika, and the tripe of a calf or lamb. *Oreja a la plancha. Literally grilled ear this common pork dish is an acquired taste, and exists in a number of forms: with garlic (al ajillo), with spicy sauce, in the Basque style (a la vizcaína), etc. *Gallinejas. A popular dish consisting of fried sheep entrails. *Gambas al ajillo and setas al ajillo. Literally prawns with garlic and mushrooms with garlic, these dishes are served piping hot and are popular appetizers for the midday meal. *Bocadillo de calamares. A bocadillo of fried squid rings that can be ordered in practically every bar. *Patatas bravas. A very common dish consisting of irregularly-cut fried potatoes covered in a spicy tomato sauce. *Soldaditos de Pavía. Strips of unsalted bacalao which are battered and fried. *Caracoles a la madrileña. A tapa consisting of snails cooked in a spicy sauce. *Besugo a la madrileña. A traditional dish of baked sea bream. *Carne al desarreglo. *Huevos estrellados. A dish of eggs fried in olive oil served with fried potatoes (e.g. diced or sliced, French fries or potato chips) and often a sliced meat (usually ham or bacon) or sausage (typically chorizo or chistorra). Desserts Madrid is renowned for its many types of traditional pastries. Some of the more common include: *Buñuelos rellenos. A type of stuffed fritter. *Rosquillas tontas y listas. Donuts finished with either a sugary glaze, dry meringue, or almond dust. These famous pastries can usually be found in pastry shops during the month of May and at the end of the Feast of St. Isidore the Laborer. *Huesos de santo. Literally, bones of the saint, these marzipans are traditionally consumed on All Saints Day. *Roscón de Reyes. *Torrijas. A kind of fried bread commonly consumed during Holy week. *Tejas and Barquillos. These pastries are commonly sold by street venders throughout the city. Beverages Madrid has its own designation of origin, which is divided into three zones: Arganda, Navalcarnero and San Martín de Valdeiglesias, comprising a total of 22,000 hectares of vineyard. A popular anisette liquor Anís, made of anise grown in Chinchón, is a typical apéritif. The traditional leche merengada, a cold cinnamon- and lemon- flavored meringue; and horchata de chufa, horchatas made of chufas original from the Valencian Community, are popular nonalcoholic beverages.

The temple is known from time immemorial as the divine place of Swayambhu Saannidhya. Devotees here pay their respect to Lord Vishweshwara by offering tender coconut Abhishekham, lit oil lamps and gold coins (pawan). It is believed that the Lord will grant all their prayers. The story goes that the Lord Ullaya got pleased with the penance observed by a devotee who belonged to the Kunda Hegde family and as result he descended from Kashi to Yelluru. The temple that belongs to the Maagane that comprises Nandikooru (Adve, Ulluru, Kolachuru), Kalathuru, Kutyaru, Padooru, Belapu and Kunjoor, has a rich and divine history of over 1,000 years. The architecture of the temple is unique and considered a classic one in the view of the Tantragama experts. The age-old temple has been considered as the perfect and unique model of the Devaayathana style of architecture. Lord Vishweshwara is referred to at least in 12 rock edicts and recorded by the Kaifiyaths. The temple has been renovated from scratch and was inaugurated in grand functions lasting from 4 March 2009 to 12 March 2009. Legends The Lord Vishveshwara is believed to have emerged from underground respecting the devotion of a Samanta Raja of Kuthyar Dynasty. The linga of the Lord Shiva thus emerged and was first understood to have been found by a Koraga community (Scheduled Tribe) mother while she was collecting firewood and leaves in the forest where her son \\"Yellu\\" was buried after his untimely death. While cutting the bush she hit the ground and the earth is said to have started bleeding. Scared by the flow of blood she screamed \\"Oh, Maga Yellu, yei Moolu Ullana?\\" (meaning 'Oh, my son Yellu, are you here?') in Tulu. In fact it was the \\"Linga\\" itself, and it is said that the mark of the wound is still on it. And the village was thereafter known from Yelluna Ooru to gradually Yellur.

Most of his paintings are now lost, and he is best knownHeck. for his treatise on architectural ornament, Architectura, published in its final edition in Nuremberg in 1598. Life Dietterlin was born at Pfullendorf in Württemberg; his original name was Grapp and he may have been a member of a family of artists in Swabia,Martin, p. 703. According to Martin, he was the son of a Pfullendorf painter named Balthus Grapp or Krapf. Michèle-Caroline Heck, in her biography of Dietterlin in Grove, claims that he \\"was the son of a Protestant pastor and spent his childhood in Lissenheim before moving to Strasbourg with his widowed mother.\\" spent most of his life in Strasbourg (then Strassburg), where he married Catharina Sprewer on 12 November 1570, and where he is known to have painted frescos for the Bruderhof, the Bishop's residence, in 1575, but he is later recorded in Hagenau in 1583 and in Oberkirch in 1589. He also worked on large projects in Stuttgart for some time (see below).Martin, p. 703; Heck. He died in Strasbourg. Paintings Lazarus, 1587, his only painting known to survive. In Strasbourg, Dietterlin worked on the decoration of the Neuer Bau (currently the building of the Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie) in 1589. Between 1590 and 1592 he was employed in Stuttgart with the execution of a large (57 metres long and 20 metres wide) ceiling painting in the upper hall of the Neues Lusthaus, a building constructed by Duke Ludwig of Württemberg for entertainment purposes. In addition to the ceiling, Dietterlin painted the walls of the hall. The Renaissance Lusthaus having later been rebuilt several times and almost entirely replaced in 1845 by the new Hoftheater (which was destroyed in a fire in 1902, when some of the remains of the original building came to light),Lambert, p. 41 nothing is now preserved of the paintings from the hall, but they are depicted in a 1619 etching by the Strasbourg-based painter and engraver Friedrich Brentel showing the interior of the large room.Heck; Borries. Other of his paintings are known from engravings by Matthäus Greuter and by his own grandson Bartholomäus Dietterlin. The style, with \\"exaggerated foreshortenings\\", appears influenced by North Italian models, such as Giulio Romano's frescos in Mantua, through German intermediaries. His only extant painting is a Resurrection of Lazarus (in the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe), signed and dated 1582 or 1587. The Architectura Columns of the Composite order in Wendel Dietterlin's version. From Architectura, plate 178. Dietterlin's architectural treatise Architectvra: Von Außtheilung, Symmetria vnd Proportion der Fünff Seulen was first published in separate parts in 1593 and 1594, and finally in a combined and expanded edition in 1598. The book described the classical orders and their character and proper use, as was traditional in such books. Dietterlin, however, showed less interest in the proportions of the order than in their ornamentation. According to the architectural historian Torbjörn Fulton, Dietterlin treats the orders \\"more as a basis or excuse for the development of a bizarre ornamental fantasy than as didactic examples of classical architectural ornamentation\\".\\"Även om gravyrserien följer den gängse grupperingen toscana – dorica – ionica – corintia – composita utgör dessa klassiska ordningar till synes mera en utgångspunkt eller förevändning för utvecklandet av en bisarr ornamental fantasi än didaktiska skådeexempel på klassisk arkitekturdekoration.\\" Fulton, p. 165. Like other theoreticians, he ascribed masculine and feminine qualities to the orders. In giving them an appropriate ornamentation that would agree with these qualities, he borrowed from older forms of ornament, including Gothic tracery. Dietterlin was dependent on many older models, and like other representatives of the Northern Renaissance (such as Hans Vredeman de Vries) he filled his surfaces with scrollwork, strapwork, gemshapes and grotesques. Dietterlin had Northern European contemporaries who likewise integrated Gothic elements in their designs, but he was unusual in the degree of blending of elements of different origin. While others kept Gothic elements clearly separate from Renaissance forms, Dietterlin would cover Renaissance elements in Gothic tracery or allow one to morph midway into the other.Fulton, p. 166-167.

Geography The Orchard Park Estate is on the northern eastern fringe of the western part Kingston upon Hull adjacent to the city boundary. Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire is 1 mile directly to the west; the North Hull Estate (Greenwood Avenue) is contiguous adjacent to the south; the eastern boundary is formed by the Beverley and Barmston Drain, beyond which is more housing, and the River Hull (0.5 mile); to the north is open farmland. As of 2014 primary schools in the area are Thorpepark Primary; The Parks Primary Academy; and St Anthony's (Roman Catholic). =Population and environment= Population at the 2001 and 2011 censuses was around 4,600, with the inhabitants being mainly white families (over 90%), predominately working class. Social housing represented 68% of all housing stock in 2011 (75% in 2001). Unemployment was extremely high in both national and local terms, at 27%. The area has suffered historically from a self re- inforcing negative perceptions of the area, resulting in low house prices and low desirability of properties; the layout of the estate has been characterised as a poorly implemented 'bastardised' version of the Radburn layout, seen as leading to problems around ownership of public spaces, such as parking areas. History Prior to the estate's development the land was open drained farmland; the northernmost housing development was on the south side of Orchard Park Road (formerly North Carr Lane, dating to at least 1850s). At the west side of the crossing of the road and the Beverley & Barmston drain (Cold Harbour Bridge) was Orchard Park Farm (formerly Cold Harbour farm).Ordnance Survey 1:15060 1855, 1911, 1938, 1956 In the 1930s the development of the North Hull Estate brought the urban growth of Hull to the edge of North Carr Lane.Ordnance Survey Sheet 226NW 1926.1938 A church St Michael and All Angels was built on the north side of North Carr Lane ; it was replaced by another church , with the older building reused as a church hall.Ordnance Survey 1:15060 1938, 1956 =1960–2000= Gorthorpe flats (2012) Construction of the Orchard Park Estate began in 1963. The estate, together with the Ings Road Estate in East Hull was built as a response to a need for more council housing stock, in part due to slum clearances of older housing stock. The estate took the form of four 'villages' (Thorpe Park, Danepark, Courtpark, and Shaw Parks), each consisting of a housing plan inspired by the Radburn design, each with a central tower block of flats. (Shaw Park lacked tower blocks.) An extension of Hall Road curved through the estate connecting from the Endike Lane (to Cottingham) to Beverley Road (to Beverley); use was made of landscaping with minor hillocks of made ground, mostly along the west and north side of Hall Road. The estate was built with school facilities as part of the development. These were Thorpe Park Primary & Junior (east end of Hall Road, near Thorpe Park Road); Court Park Primary & Junior (Courtway Road); Danepark Primary & Junior school (between Feldane & Ealdane, Dane Park Road); Shaw Park Primary & Junior (near Dringshaw, Orchard Park Road); Sir Henry Cooper High (north-east corner of the estate, Thorpepark Road); Sir Leo Schultz High (opposite Isledane, north side of Danepark Road). Additionally there were Roman Catholic schools St John Fisher Junior High School; and Holy Name Primary, adjacent on the west side of Hall Road near the junction with Courtway Road.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1964-7/1969-70 Initial plans for an 'integrated neighbourhood centre' made in 1963 were abandoned by the council in 1969; subsequently in 1974 the Orchard Park shopping centre opened. Leo Schultz School closed 1986. St John Fisher school closed 1988; the school buildings and site were later used by Humberside Police as a training centre. =2000–present= Crowns turned out watching the demolition of Ashthorpe flats In 2001 the area had high levels of unoccupied housing at 26%. Shaw Park Primary closed in 2001. Danepark Primary closed 2002. In 2002 the Parks Primary school (Courtway Road, Court Park School site) was formed from the merger of two primary schools. The development, named 'Harrison Park', is expected to be compete late 2016. Two high-rise flats in the Danepark area (Milldane) were demolished in 2002. Two of three high-rise flats in the Thorpe Park area (Homethorpe) were demolished in 2002 and 2004 (Drake House and Vernon House). In 2003 the violent murder of Rachel Moran was carried out by Michael Little on the estate. In the mid to late 2000s the council demolished parts of the estate at Feldane, Gildane, Hardane, and Isledane; reducing he housing density by approximately half, with some of the freed space converted to public space.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006 A large health centre incorporating a pharmacy was constructed in the late 2000s, and opened in 2009., Orchard Centre (health centre) In 2008, Hull City Council approved a bid for Private Finance Initiative (PFI) funding to redevelop the estate; this was approved by Housing Minister John Healey in July 2009, with an allocation of £156 million. In 2010, the then Liberal controlled Hull City Council approved the demolition of all remaining high-rise tower blocks on the estate; with over 600 new homes planned to be built on the estate. The council's plans to demolish and rebuild housing using PFI funding were upset by cuts in government funding. with the government cancelling all housing PFI projects that were at the pipeline stage. Other PFI projects on the estate outside the project continued, including the \\"Extra Care\\" (residential care) project at Homethorpe. The demolition of high-rise and mid-sized flats on the estate was not affected. Following control of the council passing to the Labour party the flat demolition decision for four of the flats was reviewed, with a report in 2012 recommending the demolition of the flats (Gorthorpe, Kinthorpe, Laxthorpe, and Highcourt). In mid 2012 the council decided to refurbish two of the flats (Gorthorpe, and Kinthorpe) due to demand for housing, and demolish the others. Sir Henry Cooper High School was closed in 2012, with most students and teachers transferring to Thomas Ferens Academy (now known as Sirius Academy North). The Parks Primary school closed 2013, re-opening as The Parks Primary Academy in late 2013. Holy Name primary school was renamed St Anthony's Primary in 2013 after the closure of the nearby Holy Name church. The structure of Holy Name church was incorporated into a care home facility in the early 2010s. The 22 storey Bridgeman House (Homethorpe) was demolished in 2012. The 22 storey Ashthorpe, and Milldane tower blocks, were demolished in 2013. In 2013 the city council approved funding for improvements to the housing stock – the main activity was to be energy efficiency improvements to the 1,195 low rise houses of the Wimpey no-fines house type; specifically insulative cladding. The Highcourt tower block was scheduled for demolition in 2014, having had its tenancy reduced to only four people; the demolition was completed in March 2015. In March 2014 agreement was reached on work to construct a 52 house new build housing development on the site of the Bridgeman house tower block. The main contractor for the £5 million project was Wates Living Space (Wates Group), acting for the developer, Riverside Group. An 'Extra Care' facility with 65 residential places as well as community care facilities was to be built adjacent, also by Riverside. In May 2014 the council decided to demolish the Gorthorpe and Kinthorpe flats which had previously been spared demolition and were planned to be refurbished. In 2014 demolition work for construction of a new shopping centre for the estate began; the development was delayed several years to the difficulty of finding an 'anchor' shopholder for the development, and due to funding difficulties. Demolition of the Kinthorpe and Laxthorpe flats began September 2014 by mechanical demolition. Demolition of the Gorthorpe flats was delayed due to previous contractual arrangements to provide a site for mobile phone masts. In mid 2016 a new location for the phone masts was found (St Michael and All Angel Church) allowing demolition of the tower block. As significant redevelopment was taking place in the 2010s the city council investigated the viability of installing district heating into properties in the area – a report by Ramboll published 2014 concluded such as scheme (costing £29.6 million) would not be commercially viable, with a low rate of return of 2.7%. In 2015 planning permission was granted for 178 new homes in the Danepark area, on a site including the former Milldane tower block. (Construction began late 2016.) In 2016 Wilmott Dixon was awarded a multi-million contract to improve energy efficiency of Hull City Council's housing stock, with measures including the installation of external insulation – 1,668 houses in Orchard Park were to be treated, with work scheduled to start March 2016. The 'Wimpey no-fines' houses in the Thorpes, Danes and Courts were to receive cladding. In 2016 the site of the former Henry Cooper school was re-purposed as a 'community park' with some of the former school's sports courts being re-used. The site was renamed \\"Sir Henry Cooper Park\\".

He began experimenting with electronic techniques in Italy in the early sixties. Pietro Grossi and HomeArt, 2001 Biography Pietro Grossi was born in Venice, and he studied in Bologna eventually taking a diploma in composition and violoncello. In the sixties Grossi taught at the Conservatory of Florence and began to research and experiment with electroacoustic music. From 1936 to 1966 was the first cellist of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino orchestra. Grossi began to experiment with electroacoustic music in the 1950s. By 1962, he had become the first Italian to carry out successful research in the field of computer music. In 1963, he turned his interest to electronic music and founded the S 2F M (Studio di Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) which made its headquarters in Florence at the Conservatorio, and he also became a lecturer in this subject. In 1964 he organized events with the association Contemporary Musical Life that introduced in Italy the work of John Cage. In 1965 he obtained the institution of the first professorship of Electronic Music in Italy. In 1967 he made the first experiences in computer music. In 1970 he made his first approaches to musical telematics organizing a performance with a link between Rimini (Pio Manzù Foundation) and Pisa (CNUCE). By invitation of lannis Xenakis, he presented another telematic concert between Pisa and Paris in 1974. His contributions to the development of new technological musical instruments and to the creation of software packages for music-processing design have been fundamental. He has not limited his work to the musical world, but also engaged in contemporary art. In the eighties he was working on new forms of artistic production oriented toward the use of personal computers in the visual arts. Grossi started to develop visual elaborations created on a personal computer with programs provided with \\"self-decision making\\" and that works out the concept of HomeArt (1986), by way of the personal computer, raises the artistic aspirations and potential latent in each one of us to the highest level of autonomous decision making conceivable today, and the idea of personal artistic expression: “a piece is not only a work (of art), but also one of the many “works” one can freely transform: everything is temporary, everything can change at any time, ideas are not personal anymore, they are open to every solution, everybody could use them”. Grossi has always been interested in every form of artistic expression. The last step of his HomeArt, is the creation of a series of unicum books, electronically produced and symbolically called HomeBooks (1991): each work is completely different from the others, thanks to the strong flexibility of the digital means. Sergio Maltagliati will continue this project creating autom@tedVisuaL software in 2012, which generates always different graphical variations. It is based on HomeArt’s Q.Basic source code. This first release autom@tedVisuaL 1.0 has produced 45 graphical single samples, which have been sammled and published. He collaborated in order to experiment with electronic sound and composition with the computer music division of \\"CNUCE\\" (Institute of the National Research Council of Pisa). Grossi’s latest multimedia experiments were with interactive sound and graphics. His later works involved automated and generative visual music software, autom@tedVisualMusiC 1.0 which he extended beyond the realms of music into the interactive work for the Internet, conceiving and collaborating with Sergio Maltagliati in 1997 of the first Italian interactive work for the web netOper@, entertaining in his own house study the first on-line performance. Selected works *1961 Progretto 2-3 this piece consisting of several different high monotones that follow one another, is extremely minimal and ambient, controlled by a computer algorithm. *1965 Battimenti an electronic work composed and realized from “working material” for the electronic Studio di Fonologia Musicale (S 2F M), made by the 94 combinations of near frequencies. *1969 Collage where the concepts of music being an open process where no work of music is a finished piece but rather something to be manipulated. *1980 Computer Music transcription and elaborations (with Soft TAUMUS synthesizer TAU2, IBM 370/168 Institutes of CNR CNUCE and IEI) from the following authors: Bach, Scarlatti, Paganini, Brahms, Chopin, Strawinskij, Debussy, Joplin, Satie, Webern, Hindemith, Stockhausen. * 1985-90 Mixed Unicum another ambient drone piece, similar to Progretto 2-3 and yet far more varied and rewarding, as the shifting tones create an alien topography of sound. * 1986 HomeArt Grossi has developed the concept of HomeArt. It consists of completely automated and generative visual processes, based on simple Qbasic computer programs .

In university, a wide range of courses, expose students to a viewpoints that help them understand the historical and political experiences of Byzantine, Ottoman and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; and the era's distinguished literary and artistic traditions. History \\"Hellenic\\" refers to a period in Ancient Greek history between 507 BCE (the date of the first democracy in Athens) and 323 BCE (the death of Alexander the Great). This period is also referred to as the age of Classical Greece and should not be confused with The Hellenistic World, which designates the period between Alexander's death and the Roman Empire's conquest of Greece (323/146/31 BCE). The Hellenic World of ancient Greece consisted of the Greek mainland, Crete, the islands of the Greek archipelago, Cyprus, Pontus, the coast of Asia Minor primarily (though mention is made of cities within the interior of Asia Minor) and the colonies in southern Italy. This is the great Golden Age of Greece and, in the popular imagination, resonates as 'ancient Greece'. The great law- giver, Solon, having served as Archon of Athens for 22 years, retired from public life and saw the city, almost immediately, fall under the dictatorship of Peisistratus. Though a dictator, Peisistratus understood Solon's wisdom, carried on his policies and after his death, his son Hippias continued this tradition (though maintaining a dictatorship that favored the aristocracy). His younger brother was assassinated (inspired, according to Thucydides, by a love affair gone wrong and not, as later thought, politically motivated) Hippias then became wary of the Athenians, instituted a rule of terror and was finally overthrown by the army under Kleomenes I of Sparta and Cleisthenes of Athens. Cleisthenes reformed the Athenian constitution and established democracy in the city during 507 BCE. He also followed Solon's lead, but instituted new laws that decreased the artistocracy's power, raised the status of the common people and attempted to join the separate tribes of the mountain, the plain and the shore into one, unified people under a new form of government. According to Will Durant, \\"The Athenians themselves were exhilarated by this adventure into sovereignty...they knew the zest of freedom in action, speech and thought; and from that moment they began to lead all Greece in literature and art, even in statesmanship and war\\". This foundation of democracy, of a free state consisting of men who \\"owned the soil that they tilled and who ruled the state that governed them\\", stabilized Athens and provided the groundwork for the Golden Age. The list of thinkers, writers, doctors, artists, scientists, statesmen and warriors of the Hellenic World important contributions to western civilization: The statesman Solon, poets Pindar and Sappho, playwrights Sophocles, Euripides, Aeschylus and Aristophanes, the orator Lysias, historians Herodotus and Thucydides, philosophers Zeno of Elea, Protagoras of Abdera, Empedocles of Acragas, Heraclitus, Xenophanes, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, writer and general Xenophon, physician Hippocrates, sculptor Phidias, statesman Pericles, generals Alcibiades and Themistocles and many more lived during this period. The Golden Age, according to the poet Shelley, \\"is undoubtedly...the most memorable in the history of the world\\" for the accomplishments and advancements made by the people of that time. Herodotus considered his own age as lacking in many ways and looked back to a more ancient past for a paradigm of a true greatness. The writer Hesiod, an 8th-century BCE contemporary of Homer, claimed precisely the same thing about the age Herodotus admired and called his own age \\"wicked, depraved and dissolute\\" and hoped the future would produce a better breed of man for Greece. Geography Major city-states and sacred places of pilgrimage in the Hellenic World were Argos, Athens, Eleusis, Corinth, Delphi, Ithaca, Olympia, Sparta, Thebes, Thrace and Mount Olympus, the home of the gods. The gods played an important part in the lives of the people; so much so that one could face execution for questioning - or even allegedly questioning - their existence, as in the case of Protagoras, Socrates and Alcibiades (the Athenian statesman Critias, sometimes referred to as \`the first atheist', only escaped condemnation because he was so powerful). Great works of art and beautiful temples were created for the worship and praise of the various gods and goddesses of the Greeks such as the Parthenon of Athens, dedicated to the goddess Athena Parthenos (Athena the Virgin) and the Temple of Zeus (listed as an Ancient Wonder) at Olympia (both works to which Phidias contributed). The temple of Demeter at Eleusis was the site of the famous Eleusinian Mysteries and is considered the most important rite in ancient Greece. In his works, The Iliad and The Odyssey, immensely popular and influential in the Hellenic World, Homer depicted the gods and goddesses as intimately involved in the lives of the people. The deities were regularly consulted in domestic matters as well as affairs of state. The Oracle at Delphi was considered so important at the time that people from all over the known world came to Greece to ask advice or favors from the god. It was considered vital to consult with the supernatural forces before embarking on any military campaign. Among the famous battles of the Hellenic World were the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE), the Battles of Thermopylae and Salamis (480 BCE), Plataea (479 BCE,) and the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE) where the forces of the Macedonian King Philip II commanded, in part, by his son Alexander, defeated the Greek forces and unified the Greek city-states. After Philip's death, Alexander conquered the world of his day, becoming Alexander the Great. His campaigns brought Greek culture, language and civilization to the world and, after his death, left the legacy that came to be known as the Hellenistic World.

Melantrich lived in the 16th century, in a period considered one of the best for literature written in the Czech language till the 18th century. This fact made Melantrich one of the most important symbols of this language during the period of the Czech National Revival in the 19th century. The important Prague publishing company Melantrich, established in 1897, is named after him. Melantrich himself established a small printing workshop in Prague, which gradually became a company of European significance. The Melantrich's Bible, probably his most important book, was published five times between 1549 and 1577.Rudolfinská Praha, p. 170 He also published books about religion and morality for both Roman Catholic and Protestant readers. He published books of various genres, including the writings of Desiderius Erasmus, Czech Renaissance Humanism literature, poems in Latin, Czech and German, translations of the herbarium by Pietro Andrea Mattioli, handbooks and dictionaries, legal literature, books for free-time and also children literature. Melantrich was a member of the executive council of the Prague Old Town. In 1557, he received the title \\"of Aventino\\" and a coat-of-arms. During his lifetime, Melantrich was known as a person educated in the spirit of Renaissance Humanism, a Lutheran, who tolerated Roman Catholicism. From 1576, he collaborated with Daniel Adam of Veleslavín, an important Czech writer, who took over the printing workshop after Melantrich's death.  Life  Jiří Melantrich was born Jiří Černý Rožďalovický. Very little is known of his early life. According to Daniel Adam z Veleslavína he died at the age of 69, and it is therefore possible that he was born in 1511. He came from a non-wealthy Utraquist family from Rožďalovice, near Nymburk. The first mention of him is from 1534, the year he became a bachelor at the Faculty of Arts of the Charles University in Prague. He may have studied in Wittenberg, Germany. His supposed encounter with another Czech intellectual, Zikmund Hrubý of Jelení, who worked in the printing workshop of Johann Froben in Basel, has not been proved. Around that time he changed his name to \\"Melantrich\\", meaning \\"black-haired\\". In 1545, he lived at the court of Jan of Pernštejn, where he published a Lutheran book in the workshop of Jan Günther. In 1545 or 1546 he went to Prague. He established a workshop and gradually started to flourish. After a revolt in 1547, however, king Ferdinand I of Habsburg forbade Czech Protestant literature. Melantrich joined the company of the Catholic Bartoloměj Netolický, and was thus allowed to publish more books. He worked there till 1552, when he started to promote separately again. The collaboration with Netolický was quite useful for Melantrich - he published many books, especially shorter ones, but also the whole New Testament. Later he completely took over Netolický's workshop. He moved his workshop from Malá Strana to the Old Town, where he gained a citizenship. In 1554 he married, subsequently becoming a widower and marrying again. He befriended new colleagues such as Tadeáš Hájek, and he acquired many useful contacts. In 1556 he published Melantrich's Bible, in 1562 the Czech edition of Mattioli's herbarium and in 1563 he printed the German version, translated by Georg Handsch. The Czech version was successful not just in Czech Lands, but also in Poland. The German translation gained success in the whole German-speaking world. Occasionally he attended the book fair in Frankfurt. In 1564 he published a book about law and justice in Czech lands by Volf of Vřesovec, and after that he published mostly shorter, less important books. In 1570, he published a new edition of his Bible. This edition was problematic for official Austrian censorship, although there were no changes since the last edition. The religious situation in the Czech lands was somewhat difficult in that time, and it was finished in 1618 by the Second Defenestration of Prague. In 1576 his oldest daughter, Anna, married his friend Daniel Adam z Veleslavína. He kept his workshop together with Daniel Adam, but there were some splits between them - Daniel Adam was more rebellious to the censorship. On November 15, 1580 Melantrich wrote his testament, and on November 19, 1580 he died. He is buried in the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague. The proof that his relations with Daniel Adam were not very good is provided by the fact that he bequeathed everything to his son Jiří, who wasn't adult in that time, and nothing to Daniel Adam. Jiří Melantrich came of age in 1584, but quickly sunk into debt, and when he died in 1586, the workshop was taken over by Daniel Adam, as the main creditor. He continued in his way to fight the censorship.

Starting in 1883, all but two were issued in September in anticipation of October, the month dedicated to the Rosary. The subject of Octobri mense was the power of prayer and the efficacy of the rosary. \\"It is indeed a cause of great sorrow that so many should be deterred and led astray by error and enmity to God; that so many should be indifferent to all forms of religion, and should finally become estranged from faith; that so many Catholics should be such in name only, and should pay to religion no honour or worship.\\"Pope Leo XIII, Octobri mense, §2, Vatican, September 22, 1891 Invoking Mary under the title Helper of Christians, Leo urges the faithful to have recourse to her. \\"The Eternal Son of God [...] did not accomplish His design without adding there the free consent of the elect Mother, who represented in some sort all human kind, according to the illustrious and just opinion of St. Thomas, who says that the Annunciation was effected with the consent of the Virgin standing in the place of humanity.\\" St. Dominic’s devotion to the rosary is in 1891 in Octobri mense: \\"the devotion was begun and spread abroad by the holy Patriarch Dominic as a most potent weapon against the enemies of the faith at an epoch not, indeed, unlike our own, of great danger to our holy religion. The heresy of the Albigenses had ...overrun many countries, and this most vile off spring of the Manicheans [...] There seemed to be no human hope of opposing this fanatical and most pernicious sect when timely succor came from on high through the instrument of Mary's Rosary. Thus under the favor of the powerful Virgin, the glorious vanquisher of all heresies\\" In every September for the next seven years following the writing of Octobri Mense in September 1891, Pope Leo XIII dedicated the month of October to the Rosary through the authorship of an encyclical.

Umm el-Qanatir, also spelled Umm el-Kanatir, ( Umm al-Qanāṭir, lit. \\"Mother of the Arches\\"), known in Hebrew as Ein Keshatot (\\"Spring of the Arches\\") is an archaeological site on the Golan Heights, whose main phase is dated to the mid-5th - 8th centuries. Excavations have revealed a Roman-period settlement, first inhabited by pagans and later by Jews, who left behind the ruins of an exquisite synagogue when they abandoned the town after it being destroyed by the catastrophic 749 earthquake. The site is located 10 kilometres east of the Dead Sea Transform, one kilometre southwest of Natur. Identification attempts based on Jewish sources have led to two possible ancient names: Kantur, mentioned by Rabbi Menachem di Luzano in his book Ma'arikh (16th/early 17th century);Eli Yassif, Intertextuality in folklore: pagan themes in Jewish folktales from the Early Modern Era, for the correct spelling and century and Qamtra, the name of a place mentioned in the Talmud and with a Jewish past dating back to the Byzantine period.Stephen Rubin, Discovering Jewish History on the Golan Heights, on the website of The Tower and The Tower MagazineUrman, Dan and Flesher, Paul Virgil McCracken Ancient Synagogues: Historical Analysis and Archaeological Discovery, p. 549, Brill, 1998, 2nd edition, series: Studia Post Biblica, No 47 (Themes in Biblical Narrative) (v. 1 & 2), .

The name of the site derives from its location 200 metres from a natural spring that flows from the cliff into three basins that were once topped by monumental basalt arches, one of which has survived.

The textiles were sold to wealthy residents in the nearby towns of Sussita and Beit Saida. The villagers may have engaged in mixed farming, and raised sheep and olives, although no terracing has been found. The catastrophic 749 earthquake brought the settlement to an end. =Syrian village= Local Syrian shepherds continued to inhabit the ruins of Umm el-Qanatir into the 1950s, reusing the carved stones. The Syrian census of 1960 listed a farm here with 90 inhabitants. Ancient synagogue Umm el-Qanatir synagogue reconstruction in progress (November 2008) Partially reconstructed Umm el-Qanatir synagogue (August 2016) =Use in antiquity (5th-8th century)= It was apparently in the fifth century that the Jewish residents built a large synagogue, which they embellished during the sixth century. The building was long by wide and calculated to have been high, making it one of the largest of at least 25 ancient synagogues discovered in the region. It was destroyed in the Golan earthquake of 749, when the Jewish inhabitants left the shattered settlement. =Rediscovery= The existence of a synagogue at the site was first documented in 1884, by Laurence Oliphant and Gottlieb Schumacher. Studia Post Biblica, Ancient Synagogues: Historical Analysis and Archaeological Discovery, Dan Urman and Paul V.M. Flesher Amid ruined walls and large blocks of stone, Oliphant discovered a stone carving of an eagle, a fragment of a cornice, a large triangular slab that he believes was placed on the lintel of the main entrance and fragments of Corinthian capitals. The eagle, a well-known motif in ancient Jewish art, particularly in the Golan and Galilee, is visible on a double column and on the front gable of the synagogue and might come from the same workshop as the decorated Torah shrine base from 'En Samsam, another Golan Heights site.Rachel Ḥachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel: Motifs of Jewish Art, p. 333, accessed 5 September 2018Rachel Hachlili, Ancient Synagogues - Archaeology and Art: New Discoveries and Current Research, p. 147, Brill, 2013, series: Handbook of Oriental Studies: Section 1; The Near and Middle East (Book 105), , accessed 5 September 2018 Torah shrine base, En Samsam, Golan Heights, accessed 5 September 2018 =Reconstruction= Reconstruction of the synagogue is under way, supervised by Yehoshua Dray and Haim Ben-David of Kinneret Academic College and Bar-Ilan University.

VPWA has pioneered several social innovations in the region, including micro leasing, the establishment of a Children and Youth Development Centre in the Eastern Region of Ghana, and campaigns such as Deworm Ghana, Green Ghana, Kick Malaria Out, and Street Library.  History  Volunteer Partnerships for West Africa was founded in 2007 by Ghanaian social entrepreneur Hayford Siaw. Initially set-up to offer only international volunteer placement programmes in Anglophone West-African countries, the organization and its partners have since expanded in scope. With the help of volunteers across the international community, the organization now implements strategic sustainable development initiatives through Economic Empowerment Initiatives, Environmental Reclamation programs, and Microfinance & Leasing inter alia, to alleviate the difficulties faced by disadvantaged communities and people in the region.  Mission and objectives  Women working in Ghana VPWA work is based on its commitment to fulfill the UN Millennium Development Goals and thus it defends an integrated approach to sustainable development. That means that its projects not only aim to lift people out of poverty but also to: *promote education: VPWA realizes Micro-Finance, Entrepreneurship and Vocational Training for the less privileged people. *reduce illiteracy and help to eradicate incidences of child labor. *advance energy and environmental policies. *strengthen resources to prevent and respond to crises. *fight the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases: VPWA aims to sensitize communities on health-related issues including malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and Buruli Ulcer. VPWA also networks with other organizations, companies and institutions to implement holistic and solution-oriented projects. The organization believes in individually targeting various social groups such as the youth, women, or the disabled, as agents to further proactive social change.  Ongoing Programs  Micro Finance & Leasing = VPWA set-up its microfinance arm in 2009, called MicroQuips, offering micro loans to micro entrepreneurs as a measure against poverty. In this first year of the program VPWA secured 80 loans for the women of Ghana, loaning out GHC11,126 or $8,192. The women have developed numerous business plans such as the procurement of a refrigerator to sell cold drinks, opening general supply stores, and sewing. VPWA also conducts a financial literacy class to teach basic financial management practices, marketing strategies and accounting. In 2011, VPWA spearheaded the concept of Microleasing in the region, loaning simple tools and machineries to micro entrepreneurs to boost their production and increase efficiency. Aimed at increasing the economic participation of women, the project has served to promote gender equality and improve the welfare of beneficiaries. = Kick Malaria Out (KMO) Campaign = Launched in 2009, VPWA runs an annual campaign aimed at generating awareness about malaria in West Africa. KMO strives to educate participants about the rate at which malaria is killing, and to teach measures that can help prevent and minimize the disease and its devastating consequences. Volunteers conduct workshops in countries such as Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia, promoting space spraying/ aerial insecticide dispersal as the most viable solution to permanently eradicate malaria in Africa. In addition, they discourage the use of stopgap measures such as mosquito nets as long-term solutions. = Deworm Ghana = According to the World Health Organization, worm infections are one of the most common long-term infections of children in low-income countries, and deworming is the most cost-effective method to significantly increase primary school attendance and a child's ability to learn in school. VPWA's annual Deworm outreach program involves volunteers going from school to school, community to community, treating children against worm infections by administering Mebendazole and Albendazole. Volunteers also encourage parents to regularly seek deworming treatment for their children and explain how cultivating habits such as wearing shoes outside, avoiding non-potable water, and washing fruits and vegetables before consumption can curb the incidence of worm infections. = Green Ghana Volunteers = Started in 2010, Green Ghana Volunteers is a project involving the planting of Moringa Oleifera trees around the region. The tree is arguably one of the world's most useful trees, as almost every part of the moringa tree can be used for food or has some other beneficial property. In the tropics, it is used as forage for livestock, and in many countries, moringa micronutrient liquid, a natural anthelmintic (kills parasites) and adjuvant (to aid or enhance another drug) is used as a metabolic conditioner to aid against endemic diseases in developing countries. Leaves can be eaten fresh, cooked, or stored as dried powder for many months without refrigeration, and reportedly without loss of nutritional value. Moringa is especially promising as a food source in the tropics because the tree is in full leaf at the end of the dry season when other foods are typically scarce. By planting the moringa trees on a large scale, the project aims to use low cost resources to generate incomes and create jobs, and in the process rehabilitate degraded land. The cultivated Moringa oleifera leaves are an excellent source of vitamins, minerals and protein. In addition, they boost food security, foster rural development, and support sustainable landcare, all useful characteristics against the backdrop of Ghana's industrially ravaged landscape and frequent dry seasons. In the long run, the project aims to harvest produce of sufficient sanitary and nutritional status to export. =VPWA Children Centre= VPWA runs a Children Centre conveniently located in the small rural village of DarmangAnhuntem near Nsawam in the Eastern Region. VPWA Children Centre provides improved child care, health, and education, towards well-being of disadvantaged children below the age of 15 in Eastern and Greater Accra regions of Ghana. VPWA arranges a sponsorship program of $45/month from individual donors, to support the overall care at the centre.  Volunteering  Since 2007, VPWA has been engaged in volunteer recruitment and placement, and recognizes the role of volunteers in its areas of operation. The recruitment process allows both skilled professionals and students to work with VPWA and its partner projects, and contributing directly to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Between 2007 and 2016, over 1500 Volunteers from 70 countries have participated in VPWA's projects in Ghana. Various opportunities are frequently published and updated on its website. Beside onsite volunteering, those unable to travel to Ghana are also given the opportunity to work virtually with VPWA through the United Nations Volunteers Online Volunteering Service. The organization clinched the United Nations Volunteers Award in 2010 and 2011, due to outstanding commitment and contributions by online volunteers.

The series was carried on the NBC Pacific radio network on Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Pacific time. History Also called The Standard Symphony Hour, The Standard Hour was sponsored by Standard Oil of California. The series began in 1926 in San Francisco, when the San Francisco Symphony faced bankruptcy. Standard Oil of California paid the orchestra's debts and in return was given broadcast rights to that year's concert series. A tradition of more than 30 years began with the first broadcast on the NBC Pacific Network, on October 24, 1926. \\"Though it was heard only on a partial network,\\" wrote radio historian John Dunning, \\"The Standard Hour was a major musical series that spanned the entire length of network broadcasting.\\" A 1943 brochure shows that the programs were carried on KPO in San Francisco, KFI in Los Angeles, KMJ in Fresno, KGW in Portland, Oregon, KOMO in Seattle, Washington, and KHQ in Spokane, Washington. The Sunday-evening series was ultimately heard in Hawaii and Alaska. The theme music for The Standard Hour, as well as a complementary radio series for children called The Standard School Broadcast, was \\"This Hour Is Yours\\". The theme was composed by Julius Haug, a violinist in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. \\"It was simple theme music, 45 seconds long,\\" wrote John Dunning, \\"and listeners who loved it and requested 'the entire piece' were surprised when told there was no more.\\" From 1935 to 1952, the broadcasts often featured the San Francisco Symphony's music director, Pierre Monteux. Other conductors on the broadcasts included Alfred Hertz, Sir Thomas Beecham and Werner Janssen. Arthur Fiedler, who led the San Francisco Symphony's \\"pops\\" concerts from 1949 to 1979, conducted several of the broadcast concerts in 1950 and 1951. A number of these broadcasts were preserved on transcription discs or magnetic tape. Some have been released on CD, including many of Monteux's concerts in the War Memorial Opera House. For more than two decades from the 1930s through the 1950s, NBC Radio broadcast programs of live classical concerts from California. The autumn months were dedicated to the San Francisco Opera, with its stars singing under the baton of its founder and general director, Gaetano Merola. Many of his singers were from the Metropolitan Opera, but a number came directly from Europe.http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/opera_quarterly/v019/19.1green.html Accolades In 1952, NBC Radio received a Peabody Award for the contributions of The Standard Symphony: > First, outstanding once-a-week symphonic broadcasts over 11 western states, > since October 24, 1926, through which Standard Oil of California achieved a > priceless public service; secondly, a radio series of highly effective > educational features for school children; and, latterly, a schedule of > brilliant television presentations over Pacific Coast and inter-mountain > facilities, known as The Standard Hour, which also maintained the highest > levels of production excellence.

Still, in certain populations, it is possible for tick infestation to be clinically significant. There is some evidence that Ixodes ricinus infected with Borrelia burgdorferi may become more efficient at infestation. Home remedies (such as vaseline or matches) have been used in the past, but are not currently recommended.

(1998) Gamal Helal (born March 22, 1954) is a Coptic-American interpreter and diplomat who has translated for several American presidents and Secretaries of State. Early life Helal, a Coptic Christian was born in Asyut, Egypt in 1954 and went on to study at Assiut University, where he earned a B.A. When he was 21 years of age, Helal left Egypt for the United States; studying at Vermont's School for International Training, he received an M.A. in cross-culture communication. In 1983 Helal officially became a U.S. citizen. Diplomatic career He began his diplomatic career in the mid-1980s when he joined the United States Department of State. In the lead up to the Gulf War, Helal interpreted for Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi emissary Tariq Aziz at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, at which time Aziz was presented with an ultimatum to withdraw troops from Kuwait. By 1993 he was a senior diplomatic interpreter, and later senior policy adviser to Dennis Ross, then the special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton. Ross, reflecting on his engagement in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, stated that \\"Most of my meetings with Yasser Arafat would start off with my delegation, but the real work would be done with just Arafat, me and Gamal.\\" At the end of Clinton's term, Helal interpreted between him and Yasser Arafat during peace talks at Camp David, and was once tasked to speak alone with Arafat to try and convince him of the opportunity of the Israeli offer. Helal continued to work under President George W. Bush and with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and was an interpreter and senior adviser on the Middle East for the Barack Obama administration until he left in October 2009 to launch his own consulting business, named Helal Enterprises.

Plateaus between drainages release their water poorly and are prone to extensive bogs and marshes, ponds and lakes, but alluvial corridors along stream courses are free draining.Chuitna Coal Project Hydrology Report Development The area through which the Chuitna and its tributaries flow is rich in coal and is known as the Beluga Coal Fields. PacRim Coal LP, a Delaware Corporation, holds a lease on of land within the coal fields. The corporation is pursuing state and federal permits for a massive surface strip mine called the Chuitna Coal Project. If granted those permits, PacRim proposes to excavate as much as 1 billion metric tons of coal from the lease territory over several decades. PacRim officials have said the mine would create 300 to 350 jobs and a tax revenue stream to local and state government coffers.Status Update Chuitna Coal Project (Produced by former PacRim contractor; DRven Corp.
