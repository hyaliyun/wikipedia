Biography  Joan Fuster Bonnin was born in Palma, Majorca in 1870. He trained at the School of Fine Arts and later at Ricardo Anckermann's studio-school. He was one of the most active, prolific, and prominent painters from the first half of the twentieth century. He had an ambition to evolve his style of painting and, although it was uncommon at the time, he was devoted exclusively to the craft of painting. He was influenced by the artistic renewal that unfolded on the island of Majorca and became interested in the innovative style of Antoni Gelabert Massot. In Bonnin's work the direct influence of the Anckermann School and of the artists Eliseu Meifrèn, Anglada Camarasa, William Degouve de Nuncques and Santiago Rusiñol can be seen. Bonnin developed his aesthetic in line with these influences, becoming a pioneer of the renewal of painting Majorcan style in the first third of the twentieth century. Joan Fuster's work was mainly related to Rusiñol, Degouve and Juan Mir. Between 1908 and 1909, he befriended the French painter Henri Brugnot. He received money from Eliseu Meifrèn, which allowed him to stay in Majorca between 1907 and 1910. In 1914, he followed the work of Anglada Camarasa, and exchanged experiences in the 1930s with Guillem Bergnes. He built a personal style which was chiefly concerned with open landscapes, space and light. He was passionate about nature and the light and colors of Majorca. Bonnin expressed his passion in an article in the August 15, 1928 issue of the newspaper El Día: > It is of interest to all Majorcan people, without distinction, to defend our > landscape that is our essence. We can not miss any opportunity that presents > itself to extol, affirm and proclaim it as much as possible. We have to take > advantage of all the opportunities we encounter, precisely because of the > fame of the Majorcan landscape, days of prosperity and welfare should > emanate for all Majorcans. His realistic impressionism style has similarities to another Majorcan painter, Miquel Forteza, which is especially apparent in the quality of his brushstrokes. Bonnin actively exhibited his work in Spain, South America and throughout Europe. Thirty solo exhibitions have been documented. These took place in Palma, Mahon, Barcelona, Bilbao and Buenos Aires. His work also appeared in exhibitions in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Marseille and Munich.

Prior to that he was a partner at another venture capital firm, Index Ventures, having led the firm's efforts to establish its life sciences practice after joining in 1997. Early life and education De Rubertis was born in Italy. He graduated from the University of Pavia with a Bachelor of Arts in Genetics and Microbiology, before earning a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of Geneva, where he also met his wife, Sandra Henchoz, who was a fellow student. De Rubertis engaged in postdoctoral research in molecular genetics at the Whitehead Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and later earned the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. Career After his postdoctoral work at MIT, in 1997 De Rubertis moved back to Geneva, where he joined Index Ventures and helped co-found the firm's life sciences practice. In 2009 he moved to London (site of another Index office) where he continues to reside. De Rubertis is responsible for all of Index Ventures’ investments in the life sciences. He has served on the Boards of Directors of many companies, including Addex Therapeutics (), CellZome (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline for $120 Million ), Genmab (), Molecular Partners (), PanGenetics (acquired by Abbott Laboratories), and Parallele Bioscience (acquired by Affymetrix). In 2012 De Rubertis spearheaded the launch of Index Ventures’ $200 Million life sciences fund in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Johnson & Johnson (J&J;), to invest in early-stage biotechnology companies . De Rubertis is the author of several publications in international scientific journals. In 2010 De Rubertis was named by BioWorld as one of 28 \\"movers and shakers\\" predicted to shape the biotechnology industry over the next two decades . In October 2012 De Rubertis was named by Xconomy as one of 40 of “Young and Proven” biotech venture capitalists. De Rubertis is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board of the University of Geneva. In February 2016 De Rubertis launches an independent venture capital firm Medicxi (formerly Index Ventures Life Sciences) and announces the closing of Medicxi Ventures 1 (MV1) a €210m fund including GSK and Johnson & Johnson Innovation. Medicxi is managed by four Partners Francesco de Rubertis, Kevin Johnson, David Grainger and Michèle Ollier all of whom previously led the Life Sciences practice at Index Ventures. On November 30, 2017 De Rubertis was named in the Bloomberg Top 50 most influential people of 2017. He was selected as one of 10 nominees in the Tech (& Science) category along with Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), Masayoshi Son (Softbank Group) and Martin Lau (Tencent Holdings). The Bloomberg Top 50 consists of 5 categories Tech (& Science), Business, Politics, Finance and Entertainment. De Rubertis's reputation for halving the time it takes for a return on biotech investments has Silicon Valley eager to get in on a $300 million fund he's raised for late-stage startups. Medicxi Growth 1, which made its first investments in health care and diabetes treatments, is taking minority stakes in companies that are developing multiple therapies, have full management teams, and intend to go public as independent businesses. This is a departure for De Rubertis. He has focused on “skinny” startups—with small management teams and only one therapy—that can integrate into larger companies after being bought. The shift hasn't diminished interest in the fund.

He was nicknamed The Rhino by Rangers fans. In his first season in British football (1955–1956), Kitchenbrand scored 24 goals in 25 league appearances to help Rangers win the Scottish League title. That season's goal tally included a 5-goal haul in an 8–0 rout of Queen of the South at Ibrox on 7 March 1956. Kitchenbrand didn't feature much for Rangers after that first season, having lost his place in the side to Max Murray, and left for Sunderland in March 1958. Kitchenbrand played 54 competitive games for Sunderland, scoring 28 goals. In November 1958 he scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Rotherham, the first hat-trick a Sunderland player had achieved in two years. Kitchenbrand returned to his homeland in 1960 to play for Johannesburg Wanderers, and a number of other teams, before coming back to Scotland two years later for a brief spell at Forfar Athletic. He played once for his country in March 1956, featuring in a South Africa representative side all consisting of British-based players and including Kitchenbrand's Rangers team-mate Johnny Hubbard.

He was the nephew and heir of John Hales, Clerk of the Hanaper, and the nephew of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote. Family John Hales was the son of Christopher Hales of Coventry and Mary Lucy, the daughter of William Lucy, esquire, and Anne Fermor, and sister of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, Warwickshire. Career Little is known of Hales's early life. In 1589, at the request of his great-uncle Sir Richard Knightley of Fawsley,John Hales's grandmother was Anne Fermor, and Sir Richard Knightley's first wife was Anne's sister, Mary Fermor; he allowed the press on which the Marprelate tracts were being printed secretly to be brought to his house at the Whitefriars in Coventry by Knightley's servant Stephen Gyfford. The first of the tracts, Martin Marprelate's Epistle, had been printed at the home of Elizabeth Hussey in East Molesey. The second tract, The Epitome, had been printed at Sir Richard Knightley's house at Fawsley. At the time, Knightley was married to his second wife, Elizabeth Seymour, a daughter of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, and a cousin of King Edward VI. Two of the Marprelate tracts, Certain Mineral and Metaphysical Schoolpoints and Hay Any Work for Cooper, as well as John Penry's A View, were printed at the Whitefriars by Robert Waldegrave. The secret press was then moved to Sir Roger Wigston's house of Wolston Priory. Henry Sharpe, who had bound the printed copies of the Marprelate tracts, later gave evidence implicating Hales, Knightley, and the Wigstons, and a special commission appointed on 16 November 1589 by the Privy Council ordered their interrogation, having concluded that: > Sir Richard Knightley, Roger Wigston and John Hales have been acquainted > with the printing and publishing of the said books, and have been favourers > and abetters of the said Martin Marprelate in his disordered proceedings. In November 1589 Hales, Elizabeth Hussey, Sir Richard Knightley, and Sir Roger Wigston and his wife were arrested and imprisoned in the Fleet. However, their interrogation failed to elicit the identity of Martin Marprelate, which appears to have been unknown to those who harboured the secret press. On 13 February 1590 Hales, Knightley, and the Wigstons were arraigned in the Star Chamber. At trial, Knightley admitted to having written to Hales requesting that he provide room for the secret press at Coventry. Despite his plea for the Queen's forgiveness, Knightley was fined £2000, and it was ordered that he be imprisoned at the Queen's pleasure. Hales denied all knowledge of the nature of the books printed on the secret press, and protested, in excuse of his actions, that: > He had great reason, as he thought, to gratify Sir Richard Knightley in > anything, to whom he owed much reverence, as he that had married his aunt'. Hales was fined 1000 marks, and, like Knightley, was ordered to be committed to prison. Sir Roger Wigston was fined 500 marks, with a similar order for his imprisonment. His wife, who took upon herself the blame for persuading her husband to allow the printing of the tracts at their house, was fined £1000 and similarly imprisoned at the Queen's pleasure. The latter part of Hales's life appears to have been uneventful. He left a will dated 30 August 1607 in which he named a son, John, and three daughters, Mary, Jane, and Bethany. Marriages and issue Hales married firstly, by settlement dated 18 September 1586, Frideswide Faunt, the daughter of William Faunt, esquire, of Foston, Leicestershire, and his second wife, Jane Vincent (d. 1585). She was the widow of Roger Cotton, esquire.Reader gives his name as Robert Cotton. He married secondly a wife named Avis, who survived him.

They compete as members of the Ohio Valley Conference. SIUE plays its home games at Cougar Field, located in the southwest corner of the campus. History Sources: Through 2018, the SIUE softball team had had only two head coaches in its history. The program was begun by Cindy Jones in 1974–75. In fourteen seasons, Jones' teams were 376–201, with two trips to the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women Division II National Tournament and two invitations to the NCAA Division II Softball Championship tournament while competing as a Division II independent. Current coach Sandy Montgomery took over the Cougars in 1989, with SIUE continuing as an independent and earning its third invitation to the Division II playoffs before joining the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) in 1996. In thirteen seasons as members of the GLVC, the Cougars won or shared seven regular season division or conference titles and five conference tournament championships. They earned ten trips to the NCAA Division II playoffs, including two spots in the Division II College World Series, and won the NCAA Division II National Softball Championship in 2007. In 2008–09, SIUE athletics began the transition into Division I, and the Cougars joined the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) in 2011. On April 9, 2014, the Cougars defeated the Saint Louis Billikens 4–1 at SLU. The win was Coach Sandy Montgomery's 900th coaching win, making her the 39th coach in NCAA softball history to reach that milestone. Coach Montgomery's record since assuming the reins in 1989 through the end of the 2014 regular season is 914–462–2. On May 10, 2014, the softball Cougars became the first SIUE team to win an OVC championship in any sport. Rain and thunderstorms shortened the tournament, played at University Field at Jacksonville State, with the losers bracket being cancelled, while the 2nd seeded Cougars and the 4th seeded Murray State Racers were the last two undefeated teams. The Cougars scored early, with four home runs in the first two innings, and defeated the Racers 12–1, with the game halted after 6 innings by the mercy rule. The squad also became the first SIUE team to qualify for an NCAA Division I tournament since the 1982 men's soccer team, when that sport had been the university's only Division I program before the school's transition to Division I for all sports began in 2008. In late July 2018, Sandy Montgomery suddenly announced her early retirement. Assistant coach Jessica Jones was naed as interim head coach for the 2019 season. Records by year All–Americans Through the years, fifteen Cougar softball players were named Division II All–Americans: *1981 – Denise Schaake *1982 – Amy Frey *1984 – Kathy Byrne *1988 – Laura McCune *1991 – Michele Cleeton *2000 – Erin Newman & Katie Waldo *2001 – Valerie McCoy & Erin Newman *2002 – Valerie McCoy *2003 – Jenny Esker & Holly Neuerburg *2006 – Alicia DeShasier & Sabra McCune *2007 – Kaitlin Colosimo In 2017, Haley Chambers-Book became the Cougars' first Division I All-American.

His main research interest is in \\"emerging adulthood,\\" which refers to the distinct phase between adolescence and young adulthood, occurring from the ages of 18 to 25. Career Jeffrey Arnett completed a B.S. in psychology, at Michigan State University in 1980. Five years later, he finished an M.A. in developmental psychology at University of Virginia. In 1986 he finished his Ph.D., also at the University of Virginia, in developmental psychology.http://www.clarku.edu/faculty/facultybio.cfm?id=615 From 1986 to 1989, he was an Assistant Professor of Psychology, at Oglethorpe University, Atlanta, Georgia. From 1989 to 1992, he was a research associate at the Rush- Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. From 1989 to 1992, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Northwestern University Department of Psychiatry and the Committee on Human Development at the University of Chicago. From 1992 to 1998 he was an associate professor at the University of Missouri. From 1998 to 2005, he was a visiting associate professor at the University of Maryland, Department of Human Development and Department of Psychology. He was awarded tenure in 1996. Arnett authored a book on heavy metal subculture and teens, entitled Metalheads: Heavy Metal Music and Adolescent Alienation (1996, Westview Press). He also authored a textbook entitled Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood: A Cultural Approach (Prentice Hall). In May 2013, he coauthored a book (with Elizabeth Fishel), entitled Getting to 30: A Parent's Guide to the 20-Something Years'. Emerging adulthood Emerging adulthood is a phase of the life span between adolescence and full-fledged adulthood, proposed by Arnett in a 2000 article in the American Psychologist.Emerging adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties. Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. American Psychologist, Vol 55(5), May 2000, 469-480. Emerging adulthood also encompasses late adolescence and early adulthood. It primarily applies to young adults in developed countries who do not have children, do not live in their own home, or do not have sufficient income to become fully independent in their early to late 20s. Arnett says emerging adulthood is the period between 18 and 25 years of age where adolescents become more independent and explore various life possibilities. Emerging adulthood is a new demographic, is contentiously changing, and some believe that twenty- somethings have always struggled with \\"identity exploration, instability, self-focus, and feeling in-between\\". Distinction from young adulthood and adolescence Arnett suggests that there are a few reasons why the term young adulthood is not fit to describe the developmental period of the late teens and early twenties. First, the term \\"young adulthood\\" suggests that at this developmental stage, adulthood has already been reached. Arnett states that most people in this developmental stage believe they have not yet reached adulthood.Arnett, J. J. (2000). Emerging Adulthood: A theory of development from the late teens through the twenties. American Psychologist, 55(5), 477. Instead, they believe they are slowly progressing into adulthood, and thus the term \\"emerging adulthood\\" is much more appropriate. What is more, if the years 18-25 are classified as \\"young adulthood,\\" Arnett believes that it is then difficult to find an appropriate term for the thirties and that it is nonsensical to combine the late teenage years, twenties, and thirties together because the 18‑25 age period and the thirties are very distinct from one another. He says that while most 18- to 20-year-olds in the United States don't see themselves as adults and are still in the process of obtaining an education, are unmarried, and are childless, most people in their thirties in the United States see themselves as adults, have settled on a career, are married, and have at least one child. Currently, it is appropriate to define adolescence as the period spanning ages 10 to 18. This is because people in this age group in the United States typically live at home with their parents, are undergoing pubertal changes, attend middle schools or junior high schools, and are involved in a \\"school-based peer culture\\". All of these characteristics are no longer normative after the age of 18, and it is therefore considered inappropriate to call the late teenage years and early twenties \\"adolescence\\" or \\"late adolescence\\". Furthermore, in the United States, the age of 18 is the age at which people are able to legally vote. Selected publications *Arnett, J. J. (2010).

In his eleventh year he went to the small grammar school in Thisted, and then to Viborg, from Viborg perhaps to Odense and finally to Roskilde school, from which he graduated in 1647. During his studies, he returned to the farm to help out. After completing his theological studies and accumulating some money, he traveled abroad in 1652, partly helped by a scholarship. Beset by lack of funds, he may have enlisted as a soldier on his travels, first in Naples, where he is said to have become acquainted with a Spanish general, under whom he served one and a half years in the Spanish guard. After his return in 1657, he took a master's degree, gave philosophical lectures and released some physico-astronomical theses, one of which, Philosophical- theological study on the first 2 verses of Genesis, attracted attention. After again having been abroad, as the steward of a young nobleman, he became in 1663 professor at Sorø Academy, which had been in decline. In 1665 he was called to court as tutor to the King of Denmark's younger son, Prince George of Denmark. He was appointed dean of Roskilde in 1666, while continuing to be the prince's confessor.

The mud ramparts which are approximately about 15 feet thick and about 5 feet in height. Each triangular arm of the star shaped fort is about 156 feet in length. The fort has eight arms encompassing a circumference of around 5/6 hectares, or 538,000 to 646,000 square feet. Summary Structure The mud ramparts have been there since ancient times and used to be a lot thicker and higher. There was also a long canal where boats were raced. The area is also called ‘Thangapat’ now, but the canal had dried up and was consequently converted to arable land. There is another rectangular jig-saw shaped figure of mud wall, located about 200 feet approximately from the star shaped fort. This rectangular jig-saw shaped figure of mud wall surrounded the star shaped fort. It is said that this rectangular jig-saw shaped wall looked like Pakhangba Paphan (the loop of the Kanglei Dragon god Lord Pakhangba) Though much of the ramparts of the outer barrier has eroded with time and farming activity around it, the fort has remained in a much better condition. The design of the fort is star shaped, which is obvious only on satellite imagery and not from the ground perspective. History The place was believed to be ruled by a king called Chakpa Charairongba. The star shaped fort may have been built with a military strategy as there are twin mud ramparts of different designs and the area is located with waterways on every direction. The age of the fort or the era in which it was built has not been verified as research is still underway. Archaeological survey According to an archeologist, Nanjesh Thongbam, the discovery of the fort was made somewhere in early 2013 when someone reported seeing the outline on Google Earth to the Kangla Fort Board. Although the age of the fort has not been established, Nanjesh Thongam, believes that radiometric dating can confirm its age but, for one, he is convinced that the fort is older than the Kangla Palace, Imphal, Manipur, India, as the mud structure is devoid of bricks. The site of the fort seems to be shrouded in local myths and it is said that cutting down of Heibi trees around the site brings bad omen, even death. Locals said there were seven Heibi trees in each corner of the rectangular jig-saw shaped wall, but only one Heibi tree is growing till now. Those who cut down the trees died soon.

He was appointed Governor of Margarita in 1676. South America Juan Muñoz de Gadea was born on 12 November 1634 in Lima, Peru. On 7 January 1650 he enrolled in the army as a harquebusier in the seaport of Callao, Peru. In February 1654 he was in Chile, where he escorted a herd of over 1,000 horses from Maule to Concepción to relieve the garrison during a native revolt. For a period he was deputy Corregidor of Colchagua Province. On 19 February 1658 he won permission to leave Chile to pay a visit to Spain. He reached Havana, Cuba, too late to sail with the annual fleet. There he found his older brother, Nicolás Muñoz de Gadea in Havana, who was starting a term as Lieutenant Governor of Cuba. Mexico and the Caribbean Muñoz Gadea sailed to New Spain, where on 7 January 1659 he was given a commission by the Viceroy Duque de Albuquerque to recruit and train a company of soldiers in Puebla. In September he was appointed Provost Marshal of all the newly formed companies that were gathering in Veracruz. On 14 December 1662 he was appointed second in command to an expedition led by Francisco de Leiva Issasi to carry troops to the Antilles. His ship with 100 troops was wrecked of the coast of Cuba, and they were marooned for a period on an offshore islet before being ferried to Havana. There they heard that the English pirate Christopher Myngs had sacked Campeche in February 1663, and were ordered to Campeche to assist in its defense. He reached Campeche by January 1664. On 15 October 1664 Muñoz Gadea was appointed sargento major and commander of the garrison of the city. In 1668 he resigned from this position. Philippines Muñoz de Gadea travelled north to Mexico City. On the journey, pirates captured the ship that carried all his possessions. On 26 November 1668 the Viceroy Marqués de Mancera offered him the position of alcade mayor of La Antigua, Veracruz. Muñoz Gadea declined this offer and instead crossed the Pacific to the Philippines, where he obtained a position on the staff of the Governor in Manila. On 18 January 1672 he was given permission to return to Spain by way of Mexico, since his brother Nicolás had died and left him as heir. In the Caribbean, the Dutch ship he was sailing on was captured by the English and taken to Jamaica. He was held prisoner there, and then shipped to England, arriving destitute in London on 20 November 1673. The Spanish Ambassador to England let him accompany his party to Cadiz. Margarita On 12 October 1674 Muñoz Gadea requested a new position in the Americas, and on 25 November 1676 he was appointed Governor of Margarita Province, off the coast of Venezuela. On 17 December 1676 he was told to travel to his new post on ships Buen Suceso and the Asunción, which were sailing independently of the fleet to Trinidad and Cumaná, and then on to Maracaibo. After some delays, he reached Isla Margarita at the end of August 1677. The island had been devastated earlier in the year by a raid by the Marquis de Maintenon at command of a fleet of 10 ships with 800 buccaneers. The former governor, Francisco de Mejía y Alarcón, had been helpless against the superior forces, who had guides familiar with the island. The privateers had looted and burned the buildings, then extorted whatever valuables the people had managed to take with them when they fled to the mountains as ransom for their prisoners. It was clear to Muñoz Gadea that the defenses urgently needed improvement. He closed all ports apart from Pampatar and threw all resources, including some of his own funds, into improving the defenses of Pampatar's San Carlos de Borromeo Fortress. Muñoz Gadea quickly antagonized the local people with his demands, including restrictions on trade, and they arranged to suspend him from office. He remained on the island, but Juan Fermín de Huidobro took over control. Juan Fermín was a military engineer and a native of Isla Margarita to whom Muñoz Gadea had given the job of building the Castillo de Santa Rosa in La Asunción. The population of Margarita had been reduced by the pirate raids, and the pearl fishery was abandoned. By a decree of 16 April 1680, all royal duties were suspended for four years. On 15 June 1680 Fermín was appointed maese de campo of Margarita. On 17 May 1681 he was appointed Governor. On 6 February 1683 Fermín reported the completion of the Castillo de Santa Rosa. Muñoz Gadea continued disputes and legal actions against Fermín, who eventually left the island. Muñoz Gadea was reappointed Governor on 19 September 1683 by the General Council of the Indies. Fermín appealed, but Muñoz Gadea was formally confirmed as governor on 28 March 1684. He left office in 1685, and in 1686 was replaced as governor by Martin Cabeza de Vaca. In response to further complaints from Fermín, the Audiencia sent judge Fernando Araujo y Rivera to Margarita, who arrived on 5 July 1688 with a body of troops. Araujo arrested Muñoz and wanted to restore Fermín, but was opposed by the people of the island, who had many complaints with his behavior while in office.

During storage the vertical position of the rubber seal's external tongue indicates the status of the sealing. Weck products are still produced and are available from German hardware and online stores. Used equipment is frequently sold on online auction sites and in opportunity shops.

It was later ported to the Super Famicom (known as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in other countries) under the title . The Super Famicom release is Japan-only. A sequel, Guardians, was released in 1995. Gameplay Denjinmakai can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters, while energy bars are displayed for special moves. The controls consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player also can perform a jump attack. When two players play, they can perform team-based special moves. Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area. In the home version, only three (Makai, Iyo, and Belva) out of the six characters are playable, and the other three (Kurokishi, Zeldia, and Tulks) were turned into bosses; one stage was also removed.

It is an image of god Buluotuo, the great ancestor of the Zhuang nation identified with the Spring of the universe (the Utmost God). Mo or Moism (), occasionally called Zhuang Shigongism (), is the religion of most Zhuang people, the largest ethnic minority of China. It has a large presence in Guangxi. While it has a supreme god, the creator Bu Luotuo (布洛陀), numerous other deities are venerated as well. It has a three-element-theory (sky, earth and water). Mo is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything. Mo developed from prehistoric beliefs of the Zhuang people; it also has similarities to Chinese folk religion,Mo Youzheng. 2009-01b. and has developed similar doctrines to Buddhism and Taoism, in the process of competition with the influence of these religions on Zhuang culture.Yang Shuzhe. 2001-04.Yang Shuzhe. 2002-04. The Cultural Revolution of China weakened Mo, though the religion has undergone a revival since the 1980s.He Qimin. 2011-03.Qin Cong. 2011-01. Moism varies from region to region.  Beliefs  Mo has a three-element theory (sky, earth and water). The religion is animistic, teaching that spirits are present in everything. The spirits are seen as immortal and subject to changes in mood. Mo exhibits totemism and the cult of reproduction.  Deities  In Mo, Bu Luotuo is considered the supreme god, creator and the founder of the religion. The Flower Mother, Me Hoa, is seen as the creator of humanity and Bu Luotuo's wife. As the goddess of reproduction, she is seen as governing a large garden of golden flowers (boys) and silver flowers (girls). Whoever behaves with good sense and sentiment will receive good flowers (i.e. good children), while those who behave with bad sense receive bad flowers. Families have altars for her. Other gods include Tudigong, who is thought to protect the village; She Shen, who is the village tutelary spirit; the Shan Shen (\\"god of the mountains\\"); and the Dragon King. Rice is seen as important; there is therefore a field god and a rice god.  Cosmology  In Mo, spirits are thought to be present in everything, and even inanimate things such as water are considered to have souls. Mo spirits include deities and ancestors as well as devils. People are considered to have three souls after death: One goes to the sky, one to the cemetery and one comes back to the deceased's family. Souls of the dead enter a netherworld but can continue to assist the living. According to the religion, people who have died by violence can become evil spirits.  Practices  Praying is common within this religion. Sorcerers venerate their masters as well as the founders of witchcraft in their family. There are temples dedicated to land gods. The sun god is celebrated and given offerings. Mo has the sacred epic Buluotuo, concerning the creation of the universe and life as well as how to live a religiously meritorious life. Its transmission was originally oral. According to Mo, every person is a flower in the garden of Molujia, the goddess of birth. On February 29 of the peasants' almanac, the goddess's birthday, women pick flowers and pray to her for pregnancy. She is said to have been born in a flower at the beginning of the world. There is a festival for her, which varies in place, date and ceremonial procedure. The religion has the custom of burying the dead twice. People who have died by violence are cremated to prevent the release of potential malevolent spirits.  Shamans and mediums  Mediums, shamans or sorcerers are employed at funerals, to treat disease, and to ward off evil. Mo has female shamans, who attempt to treat sickness and communicate with ancestors while in trances. They mostly are recognized as shamans after having had a state similar to trance and claims to have met spirits in this state. In rural areas, they are considered prophets and miracle healers. There are also male shamans, who serve at an altar. There are sacrifices of oxen, chickens, and other livestock.  Domestic worship  A complete family is considered to have three parts: The descendants of the same ancestors, the grave site, and the spirits of the ancestors. The spirits of the ancestors are given great consideration and seen as protecting people. To return to the sacred world of the ancestors is seen as the greatest end for the deceased. Frequently, Mo practitioners have a hall for the ancestors of their homes where ancestors from the past three generations are venerated. Such halls are also the site of ancestor worship ceremonies for important festivals, weddings, deaths and births. It is not allowed to put dog, cat or snake meat in front of the hall. Mo adherents feel a mixture of fear and awe towards their ancestors, believing that their ancestors can support or punish them at will. Because they believe their fate is in the hands of their ancestors, the family propitiates the ancestors through prayer and sacrifices.  Festivals  Mo practitioners celebrate the following festivals of Chinese origin: the Spring Festival, the Qingming Festival, the Duanwu Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival and the Dongzhi Festival. Regular rituals are performed on traditional celebrations prescribed in the yearly calendar. The supreme deity of Mo is a sky god. There are sacrifices to him on the morning of the new year. Sanyuesan is a festival, which takes place on the 3rd of March of the lunar calendar and is considered to be as important as Qingming. On the same day, before the festival takes place, sacrifices for the ancestors take place and graves are cleaned. Adherents sing, and boys keep an eye out for potential female partners. Cattle are seen as holy. The Cattle Soul Festival is celebrated on the 8th day of the 4th lunar month, which Mo adherents believe is the birthday of the Cattle King. On this day, adherents go to their cattle barns and free the animals from their yoke. The Frog Festival takes place during the 1st lunar month, when people pray for rain and a good harvest. The Ghost Festival takes several days, and is based on the belief that the deceased can contact their relatives as ghosts or by other supernatural means. Families clean their homes carefully and undertake other preparations; then the ghosts are welcomed. Finally, families say goodbye to the ghost and burn objects so that the ghosts are supplied in afterlife.

The film stars Aaron Aziz, Ady Putra, Soffi Jikan and Zizan Razak. KL Gangster follows Malek (Aziz) who is a former gangster fresh out of prison, wanting to change his life. KL Gangster is reported as the one of the first Malaysian-made films to reach the collection point of $3,309,610 (10 million) in local cinemas.Article 10.3 million for KL Gangster KL Gangster (reaching past the 10 million mark) beat the overall record held by Ngangkung (another Malaysian-made film) which released in 2010. This film is a direct prequel to KL Gangster 2 Plot KL Gangster tells the story of two brothers Malek (Aaron Aziz) and Jai (Ady Putra) who are entrapped in the gangster world. Malek was imprisoned for years due to being betrayed by his own group's masterminded, Shark (Syamsul Yusof) who is a stepchild to the King (Ridzuan Hashim), a leader of the most influential secret societies in KL. For Malek, after his release from prison, he wants to change the perception of life and stay away from the black life as a gangster. Routine normal life while caring for his aged mother, but as a former prisoner stigmatised by society is quite difficult for Malek at first. He is often interrupted by former gangster members who still bear a grudge with him, until the King appears, and offers help to Malek start so he can start his new life. The King had ordered his men not to disrupt Malek, which is disliked by Shark, who wants to be the next \\"King\\" in KL. In contrast, his brother, Jai, who is still alive, has continued to link himself with the gangster world. For Jai, the material luxuries of life is everything, and believes that this can only be achieved with the black world of work, willing to do anything for money and power. To do this, Jai completes missions for Shark. Jai is the one who will step forward to help Shark in any fight or gang confrontation, quickly becoming his right-hand man. But with the emergence of Malek, Shark feels increasingly threatened, feeling challenged. With various possible ways to bring down Malek, every single plan is constantly thwarted by his stepfather, King, who often defends Malek, regarding himself and Malek as friends. King does not enjoy the hassle of constantly thwarting Shark's attempts to get at Malek, with Shark now involving other gangster groups to get at Malek. This makes the relationship with King and Shark cold. For King, reconciling with Malek is helping and showing a good gesture towards him. For Shark, Malek causes everything wrong. With Shark ordered to remove Malek's brother, Jai, to get at Malek directly, loyalty becomes tested.

Mingw-w64 can be run either on the native Microsoft Windows platform, cross- hosted on Linux (or other Unix), or \\"cross-native\\" on MSYS2 or Cygwin. Mingw-w64 can generate 32 bit and 64-bit executables for x86 under the target names and .  History  In 2005, Mingw-w64 was created by OneVision Software under clean room design principles, since the original MinGW project was not prompt on updating its code base, including the inclusion of several key new APIs and the much needed 64-bit support. In 2008, OneVision then donated the code to Kai Tietz, one of its lead developers, under the condition that it remains open source. It was first submitted to the original MinGW project, but refused under suspicion of using non-public or proprietary information. For many reasons, the lead developer and co-founder of the MinGW-w64 project, Kai Tietz, decided not to attempt further cooperation with MinGW. MinGW-w64 provides a more complete Win32 API implementation, including: * better C99 support * POSIX Threads (pthreads) support (including the possibility to enable C++11 thread-related functionality in GCC's libstdc++) * GCC multilib, which allows users to install 32-bit and 64-bit libraries in parallel * Unicode entry point (wmain/wWinMain) * DDK (from ReactOS) * DirectX (from Wine) * Large file support * Win64 support * Structured Exception Handling (SEH) instead of DWARF or sjlj on x86-64 (from gcc 4.8+) * Some useful tools such as \`gendef\` (an improved version of MinGW's \`pexports\` utility), and \`widl\` (an MIDL compiler from Wine). Additionally, the Mingw-w64 project maintains winpthreads, a wrapper library similar to pthreads-win32, with the main difference that it allows GCC to use it as a threads library resulting in functional C++11 thread libraries \`\`, \`\`, and \`\`.

Cygwin provides a full POSIX environment (as a windows DLL) in which applications, compiled as Windows EXEs, run as they would under Unix.https://medium.com/@borekb/zsh-via- msys2-on-windows-3964a943b1ce Instead of providing a full environment like Cygwin does, MSYS2 tasks itself with being a development and deployment platform. MSYS2 installs 3 sets of environments, each with a separate set of programs and libraries. Two of them, called 32-bit MinGW-w64 and 64-bit MinGW-w64, are simply composed of native compilers, build tools and libraries that can be directly used to build native Windows 32-bit or 64-bit programs. The final programs built with the two native environments don't use any kind of emulation and can run or be distributed like native Windows programs. The third environment installed, called MSYS2, instead provides an emulated POSIX environment, like Cygwin, with a package manager and standard Unix system tools. This way, when managing MSYS2 itself, standard Unix tools can be used unmodified by using the emulated environment. It's also possible to install build tools in the MSYS2 emulated environment in case the user wants to build software that depends on the POSIX emulation layer instead of the native API. The main MSYS2 environment provides a package manager (Pacman from Arch Linux), a bash shell, and other Unix programs. It uses a runtime library msys-2.0.dll (~20MB) that is derived from the Cygwin library cygwin1.dll, and is updated regularly to keep track of the Cygwin development. It is intended as a development environment, one that developers can manager (using pacman) and run their tools with. Features judged unnecessary for development are removed.https://github.com/msys2/msys2/wiki/How-does-MSYS2-differ-from-Cygwin As with Cygwin, MSYS2 supports path translation for non-MSYS2 software launched from it. For example one can use the command to launch an editor that will open the file with the Windows path .Example taken from the overview article https://www.booleanworld.com/get-unix-linux-environment-windows-msys2 MSYS2 and its bash environment is used by Git and GNU Octave for their official Windows distribution. Compiler Most languages supported by GCC are supported on the Mingw-w64 port as well. These include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, and Ada. The GCC runtime libraries are used (libstdc++ for C++, libgfortran for Fortran, etc.). A packaging of LLVM's clang to mingw-w64 is also provided by MSYS2. It supports ARM for Windows ( and ). Binaries (executables or DLLs) generated with different C++ compilers (like Mingw-w64 GCC and Visual Studio) are in general not link compatible due to the use of different ABIs and name mangling schemes caused by the differences in C++ runtimes. However, compiled C code is link compatible.http://mingw.org/wiki/Interoperability_of_Libraries_Created_by_Different_Compiler_Brands Clang is an exception, as it mostly supports MSVC's C++ ABI on Windows. The binutils documentation has up-to-date information about its handling of various windows-specific formats and special tools for doing so.

IM Creator was founded by CEO Jonathan Saragossi in 2011. IM Creator's tools allow individuals and businesses to create and maintain HTML5 websites, blogs and online stores without writing code. All services are bundled, and hosting by IM is mandatory. History IM Creator was founded in early 2011 by chief executive officer (CEO) Jonathan Saragossi, who formerly worked for Wix as the VP of its design team. The company, headquartered in New York City with an office in Tel Aviv, Israel, is backed by angel investors sought out prior to its launch. A few months after inception, IM Creator entered its open beta phase using a platform based on HTML. Three to five months after open-beta, IM Creator was featured in a news article by The New York Times, CBS News and The Next Web online newspapers. NYTimes revealed that IM Creator claimed to have over 2,000 paying customers and raised over $300,000 from friends and family within its starting months. A year later the company launched IM Creator Mobile Website Builder (branded as IXM), and in 2014, IM Free—a curated collection of free resources, all for commercial use. In 2015, IM Creator introduced its latest platform (previously known as IM XPRS) along its older website builder now commonly referred to as the legacy product. The differences between the two sitebuilders is the site creation process, and that its latest platform allows for the creation of responsive websites using flat UI. Existing sites built in the legacy product continue to be supported, but all new customers are directed to the new platform. The company also launched IM Self, a blog creator for mobile devices.

He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota, which is also where he received his MD and MPH. Breslow served in the United States Army during World War II, and when he returned took a position with the California State Department of Public Health. While in medical school, he was studying to be a psychiatrist and, as a junior, he worked for a summer in the Fergus Falls Minnesota State Hospital for the Insane. His experience there left him discouraged once he realized that in that time, there was not much they could do for those patients except keep them out of harm's way. When he returned to medical school for his senior year, he told a friend of his, also a faculty member, about his feelings and was introduced to a new professor of public health, Gaylord Anderson. Anderson was the one that got Breslow set on a career in epidemiology. Breslow was considered an exemplary doctor as well as a genuinely good person. In an obituary written by one of his former protégées it says, \\"I was one of Lester's preventative medicine residents 15 years ago…Having had an opportunity to observe him engage with 'paupers' and 'kings,' I can attest to his treatment of all with respect and appreciation for their humanity, abilities, and contributions. I can also attest to his refusal to accept anything less than the best, from others (like me!) and particularly, from himself.\\" Work Breslow's work, which lasted for more than half of a century, made a very large impact on the world of public health. He is credited with pioneering chronic disease prevention and health behavior intervention. One of his most famous works is with the Human Population Laboratory, where he looked at the correlation between lifestyle issues like exercise, diet, sleep, smoking, and alcohol with mortality. He believed that health should be regarded as a resource for everyday life, as opposed to just a way to prevent disease.

His father was called Drupa. As a child he demonstrated excellent abilities in learning quickly and effortlessly. He began his studies at Dzogchen Monastery where he was also trained in Tantric rituals and assigned to the position of chöchen, the great chöpon. At that time he participated in reconstructing Dzogchen Monastery by drawing, painting and making masks. Later he continued his studies at Dzogchen Shri Singha University where he studied the traditional Tibetan curriculum from the practices of the three bases of discipline to the highest Tantras. He engaged in the practice of listening, reflecting and meditating through which he gained knowledge of great Indian commentaries and gained meditative experience. Through the practice of discipline he tamed his mindstream. Among his teachers were great masters such as Khenchen Dechen Namdröl, Khenchen Pema Tsewang, Drukpa Rinpoche Thupten Nyima, Kyabje Pema Kalzang Rinpoche and Kyabje Alak Zenkar Rinpoche. Patrul Rinpoche continued his career of enlightened activity in Drupong Dzogchen monastery (Dzogchen Monastery in southern India) where he taught as a Khenpo for four years. While there, he founded a Dharma Centre of the Nyingthik Diamond Vehicle. At that time, Choktrul Sogyal Rinpoche bestowed him the title of supreme Dorje Lopön (master of ritual) and requested him to remain in the external seat of the Dzogchen Monastery for a long time. Also at that time, Minling Trichen Gyurme Kunzong Ongyal and Shapchoke Dzogchen Rinpoche announced that he was a true reincarnation of the former tulku and offered him the crown title of holder of the teachings of Drupe Ongshuk Gyalwa Dzogchenpa.  Recognition and Enthronement  Dzogchen Ranyak Patrul Rinpoche was officially recognised as the fourth reincarnation of Dza Patrul Rinpoche (third reincarnation of Ranyak Patrul) on 7 April 1997 by Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche, then head of the Nyingma school. In this letter was also an acknowledgement that there would be obstacles to Ranyak Patrul Rinpoche's activity and Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche specified the practices that should be performed in Dzogchen. Dzogchen Jikme Losal Wangpo Rinpoche (the current reincarnation of Dzogchen Rinpoche) wrote a letter containing an aspiration prayer for the development of Patrul Rinpoche's activities for the benefit of the teachings and all beings. In 1999, the 14th Dalai Lama wrote a letter supporting Mindrolling Trichen Rinpoche's recognition letter.Full biography Kyabje Pema Kalzang Rinpoche performed the enthronement ceremony in Brussels, Belgium, on 11 June 2000, and wrote a letter to say that Ranyak Patrul Rinpoche was one of the Dzogchen teachers from TibetMasters of Dzogchen Monastery and that he acted as the representative of all the other Dzogchen masters of the Dzogchen Valley who could not be present on that day. Tulku Dakpa Rinpoche was also present.  Altruistic Projects  In the West, Patrul Rinpoche has continued his activities to benefit beings and disseminate the Buddha's teachings around the world.

Since 2016, he has been Executive Director of Impact NW, a social service and anti-poverty organization headquartered in Portland, Oregon. He served as chairman of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners from 2010 to 2013. Multnomah County is Oregon's most populous county, with approximately 742,000 residents. The cities of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, Troutdale and Wood Village are all located within Multnomah County.  Early life  Jeff Cogen was born on an American military base in Germany and grew up in Miami, Florida, with his parents and brother. In high school, Cogen was a member of the debate team and earned the title of Top Individual Speaker at the Florida State Debate Championship. Cogen attended Brown University, where he received a B.A. degree in Political Science. He then earned a J.D. degree from the University of California, Los Angeles.  Early career  Cogen practiced law for four years in San Francisco, California, until relocating to Portland, Oregon, with his wife, Lisa in 1992. There, they and some friends started Portland's first certified organic bakery, the Portland Pretzel Company. Cogen was president of the small company, which in early 1996 had eleven other employees.  Political career  Cogen served as communications director for the Multnomah Commission on Children and Families. He later joined the board for Hands on Greater Portland, a nonprofit that connects volunteers with initiatives in their community, where he was elected board president. Cogen entered Portland politics by joining former Multnomah County Chair Beverly Stein's staff in 1999. Cogen then went to Portland city hall, and in 2003 was named chief of staff to Portland City Commissioner Dan Saltzman. In 2006, Cogen was elected to the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners as Commissioner for District 2, representing North and Northeast Portland. In March 2010, then-Multnomah County Chair Ted Wheeler resigned from his role on the Board of County Commissioners to step into the position of Oregon State Treasurer, to which he was appointed after the death of incumbent Oregon state treasurer Ben Westlund. Soon afterward, the board chose Cogen as Multnomah County Chair, effective April 1, to complete the remainder of Wheeler's term. In May 2010, Cogen was elected to a four-year term as Multnomah County Chair and sworn in on January 6, 2011.  Projects and initiatives  Cogen in 2011 During his time on the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners, Cogen has overseen the following efforts: *The opening of the Gateway Center for Domestic Violence Services, a \\"one-stop center\\" for domestic violence services in 2010. :The center is run in partnership between Multnomah County and the City of Portland and offers onsite services to domestic violence survivors and their children including: :* Crisis and safety planning :* Restraining order applications :* Access to specially trained police officers :* Prosecution services and support :* Alcohol/drug and mental health assessment services :* Civil legal assistance :* Children and teen support services *Creation of the Multnomah County CROPS Farm: in 2009, Cogen's office launched the Multnomah County CROPS Farm, a piece of county-owned land used to grow fresh produce for the Oregon Food Bank. The surplus Multnomah County property in Troutdale, Oregon, was converted into a two-acre farm and has since grown vegetables for people accessing the Oregon Food Bank. *Sale restriction of reusable beverage containers containing Bisphenol A in Multnomah County: in October 2011, Multnomah County's Board of Health adopted a policy brought forward by Cogen that restricted the sale of all reusable beverage containers that contain Bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical used in certain hard plastic containers like baby bottles, sippy cups and water bottles within Multnomah County. > According to the Multnomah County website, \\"The Health Department's analysis > found that babies and young children are more vulnerable to the effects of > Bisphenol A. Disruption of an infant's hormonal system can affect their > development, putting them at risk for behavioral problems, breast and > prostate cancer and a variety of other issues. :In July 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the use of Bisphenol A in sippy cups and baby bottles nationwide. *Change in policy on immigration holds in Multnomah County jails: in April 2013, Multnomah County Sheriff Dan Staton adopted a change in policy developed in partnership between Cogen's office and Multnomah County Sheriff's Office to stop complying with federal immigration holds for low-level offenders in Multnomah County jails. :Prior to this change in policy, people booked in Multnomah County jails and suspected of undocumented immigration by U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), were held for up to 48 hours at the federal government's request. These 48-hour holds, called I-247 detainers, keep people in jail even after they have been cleared of their booking charges. They can be enforced no matter the allegation. :Under the change in policy, which went into effect April 15, 2013, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office no longer holds people for U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement after their booking charges have cleared if: :* They have been charged with low-level misdemeanors :* An ICE detainer has been issued based solely on immigration charges or convictions *Coal export health impact study: in September 2012, Cogen directed the Multnomah County Health Department to conduct a study on the impact of coal export by rail through Multnomah County on residents' health. The call for the study was brought on by proposals for new coal export terminals in Oregon and Washington. :The report, which was completed by the Health Department in February 2013, looked at populations in Multnomah County that would be most affected by coal transportation by rail, as well as six potential environmental effects of concern, including \\"emission of particulate matter in the form of coal dust\\" and \\"emission of particulate matter in the form of diesel locomotive exhaust.\\" Potential health outcomes associated with coal dust and diesel exhaust identified in the report included \\"heart and lung problems, cancers, growth and development problems, stress and mental health problems, injury and death.\\" *Creation of a firearms safety ordinance: in April 2013, the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a firearms safety ordinance co-sponsored by Chair Cogen and District 1 Multnomah County Commissioner, Deborah Kafoury. : > According to the Multnomah County website, the ordinance restricts \\"the > possession of a loaded firearm in a public place with certain exceptions, > including licensed hunters engaged in lawful hunting, target shooters at an > established target shooting area, people licensed to carry a concealed > weapon, and law enforcement officers in the performance of their official > duty.\\" Additionally, the ordinance restricts \\"the discharge of a firearm in > Multnomah County, requires firearm owners to prevent access to firearms by > children, requires reporting the theft of a firearm within 48 hours, and > extends curfew hours for minors who have been found by a court to have > possessed, bought, used, transferred or transported a firearm and are under > supervision. *Opening of the Mental Health Crisis Assessment and Treatment Center (CATC): Cogen coordinated with the City of Portland, the State of Oregon and Central City Concern to open the Mental Health Crisis Assessment and Treatment Center (CATC) in June 2011. The center is located at 55 N.E Grand Ave. in Portland, Oregon. :In 2011, Jaymee Cutti of Oregon Public Broadcasting described the CATC as such: \\"The 16-bed facility will serve as a safety net for homeless and severely low-income individuals experiencing a mental health crisis, where they can stabilize, and then connect to longer term services for housing, treatment, education or job training.\\" *Sale of the Morrison Bridgehead: in June 2012, the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners unanimously voted in favor of a resolution brought forward by Chair Cogen proposing the $10.4 million sale of the county-owned Morrison Bridgehead site. :The board-approved agreement finalized the sale of the bridgehead to Melvin Mark Development Company for the creation of the James Beard Public Market - a planned year-round indoor and outdoor food market with a high-rise tower and sky-bridge connecting the properties. :The Morrison Bridgehead is a 3.12-acre site on the west side of the Morrison Bridge in downtown Portland, Oregon. It was first acquired by the county in the 1950s as a bridge construction staging area and has most recently been used for surface parking. The site was declared surplus county property in 2004. *Creation of a library district in Multnomah County: the Multnomah County Library is Oregon's largest public library, serving nearly one-fifth of the state's population. It is the second busiest library in the United States. :On August 2, 2012, in a resolution brought forward by Chair Jeff Cogen's office, the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously in favor of referring a measure to the ballot that would allow county residents to vote on the creation of a permanent library district for the Multnomah County Library in the November 2012 election. :Since 1976, the Multnomah County Library system was funded through a combination of the county's general fund and a series of temporary tax levies that had to be renewed by voters every three to five years. :On November 6, 62 percent of county voters voted in favor the ballot measure, approving the creation of a permanent library district for the Multnomah County Library. The library district, effective July 2013, provides funding for the library system solely through a permanent taxing district at a limited rate of up to $1.24 per $1,000 of a property's assessed value in Multnomah County. *Executive rule requiring gender-neutral bathrooms in new and updated Multnomah County buildings: On June 11, 2013, Cogen signed an executive rule requiring that all new and remodeled Multnomah County-owned buildings have gender-neutral bathrooms installed, in addition to traditional gender-specific bathrooms. : > According to Dana Tims of The Oregonian, the executive rule \\"is intended to > eliminate stigmas for transgender county employees and visitors using > county-owned restrooms.\\" :The rule also calls for the hanging of signage directing people to available gender-neutral restrooms in existing county facilities, as well as an assessment of where there may be a need for gender-neutral restrooms in existing Multnomah County facilities. : > According to Sergio Cisneros of Oregon Public Broadcasting, \\"Multnomah is > one of the first counties in the U.S. to implement a gender-neutral bathroom > rule. Philadelphia was the first city to have such a rule.\\" 2013 controversy and resignation In 2013, Cogen admitted to an extramarital affair with a policy advisor in the Multnomah County Health Department following public allegations. The policy advisor resigned under pressure from the county health department for having a conflict of interest. For some weeks, he rejected calls for him to resign, which included a July 24 vote by his four fellow county commissioners. \\"I deserve a chance for the facts to come out,\\" he told the media. However, on September 6, 2013, he announced his intention to resign, effective ten days later. His final day in office was September 16. He was succeeded as county chair by his chief of staff, Marissa Madrigal, who was sworn-in on September 17, 2013. Post- political work In June 2016, Cogen was named executive director of Impact NW, a social service and anti-poverty organization headquartered in Portland. He began working in the position on July 1, 2016. In February 2020, Cogen filed his candidacy with the Oregon Secretary of State to run in the 2020 Democratic primary to succeed retiring state Representative Alissa Keny-Guyer in Oregon's 46th House district.  Personal life  As of 2011, Cogen was living in Northeast Portland with his wife, Lisa and their two children. He enjoys reading science fiction novels and is an avid fan of live music, especially the Grateful Dead. In July 2017, Cogen suffered a stroke that was described as moderate.

Life  Adrian Diel’s father Kaspar Ludwig was a surgeon and apothecary. August Friedrich Adrian studied in Giessen and Strasbourg. He earned a Doctorate in Medicine and Surgery in 1780, and became a physician in Gladenbach. In 1786, Diel served as practitioner of the Count of Spaur, who was Judge at the Imperial Court in Wetzlar, and dealt mainly with Balneology. In 1790 he took over the office of spa doctor in Bad Ems (Nassau) and, at the same time, was the district physician at his residence in Diez. In the same year, Diel became Aulic Councillor, then Private Councillor of the Duchy of Nassau. He married a native of Diez, Maria Altgelt, but she died soon afterwards. In Diez, in the property known up to this day as \\"House Eberhard\\", which his wife had brought into the marriage, Diel planted extensive orchards with reportedly up to 12,000 apple trees. Diel gained importance as a breeder of fruits and as an author of pomological writings, and laid the basis for the rise of that science in the 19th Century. In addition to his work on the systematics of the fruit trees, Diel also exerted political influence to promote fruit cultivation in the Duchy of Nassau. After the vineyards had been largely destroyed in the immediate area of Diez because of pest infestation, Diel also created large plum orchards. The introduction of cherries at higher elevations in the Lahn area, and the Nassau government regulation on planting fruit trees by the roadsides and on creating orchards in schools goes back to his initiative. From his marriage with Adrietta Dorothea Christine, born Scriba, were born seven children. In 1925, the city of Diez named a newly created road as Dielstraße. In his native city of Gladenbach there is an Adrian-Diel- Straße.

Plot  Fleeing Northern Ireland after realizing she was pregnant, 19-year-old Taryn finds refuge with her aunt Kim in Baltimore. She is parting ways with her partner, Bill, under the reproachful gaze of their daughter Abby.

The project achieved its goal of $40,000 on August 13, 2011. Cast Porterfield had already known Ned Oldham for several years before casting him as Bill, and Amy Belk went to college with Kim Taylor in the 1990s. After meeting Taylor and seeing her perform, Porterfield \\"knew almost immediately she had what [he] was looking for\\". Porterfield first met Hannah Gross and Deragh Campbell when they attended the premiere of his previous film, Putty Hill (2010), but didn't keep in touch with them. He later auditioned Gross, following advice from a friend who is a professor at New York University, where Gross studies in the Experimental Theater Wing. Through Gross, Porterfield later met Campbell and cast them both in the film. Reception Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 7.34 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 69 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a grade A-, and wrote: \\"Drenched in the evening glow of its urban and suburban backdrops, Darker comes alive in the dark, when its characters are drowning their sorrows in song, the sauce, or conversation.\\" Sheri Linden of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"It's a story of contained chaos, quietly observed — one that catches fire more in retrospect than in the viewing.\\" Accolades I Used to Be Darker won the award for Best Narrative Feature at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2013 and Matthew Porterfield won the award for Best Director at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema.

In 2000, Keys signed a recording contract with J Records and released her debut single \\"Fallin'\\", taken from her first studio album Songs in A minor (2001). The plot of its music video had Keys traveling to a prison to visit her incarcerated boyfriend and was continued in the video for her next single, \\"A Woman's Worth;\\" both videos marked Keys' first collaboration with director Chris Robinson, who would become a regular collaborator later.

It won the Best R&B; Video accolade at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2008, Keys collaborated with former The White Stripes singer Jack White on \\"Another Way to Die\\", the theme song for the James Bond film Quantum of Solace.

His younger brother Lloyd was also a professional footballer. Career Born in Owerri, Nigeria, Opara came through the youth ranks at Colchester United where he made 19 league appearances for the club between 1998 and 2000. He made his debut for the club in a 2–1 defeat to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on the final day of the 1998–99 season, coming on as a substitute in the 81st minute for Steve Germain. Opara was a prolific goalscorer in the United youth and reserve teams, but could not find the same form in the Colchester first-team having been pushed into the first-team early following the success of former starlet Lomana LuaLua prior to his departure to Newcastle United. He was eventually released by the club following an act of misconduct while on his weekly academic day of his scholarship with the club. His last appearance in the first-team came in a 1–0 defeat by Stoke City at Layer Road on 30 September 2000, coming on as an early substitute for Tony Lock. Leyton Orient picked up Opara's scholarship, paying Colchester a nominal compensation fee. He helped his team win the Youth Alliance Cup in 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. He was also loaned out to Dagenham & Redbridge and Billericay Town during his time with the O's, making four appearances and scoring once for the former. He made six appearances for the first-team whilst with the club, before being released in 2002. Following a trial period with Darlington during pre-season for the 2002–03 season, Opara joined Billericay on a permanent basis. He later played for a number of non-league clubs, including a return to Dagenham & Redbridge, Purfleet, Redbridge, Heybridge Swifts. While he was signed to Heybridge, Opara was involved in a serious car accident in March 2003 in which five people died. The accident occurred in North London on 15 March in the early hours of a Saturday morning when Opara was driving himself and four passengers in his Vauxhall Calibra when his car was struck by a speeding Vauxhall Omega. Three of his four passengers (two women aged 18 and a 20-year-old man) were killed in the accident, and both driver and passenger of the Omega were also killed. The incident left Opara in a serious but stable condition in hospital. He recovered from his injuries and resumed his playing career in 2004, appearing for Erith & Belvedere and Harlow Town. Personal life Opara has a younger brother, Lloyd, who was also a scholar at Colchester United at the same time. Lloyd played six times for Colchester and also appeared for Cambridge United, Swindon Town and Peterborough United.

Detroit, Mich: Gale, 2010 In 2007, Colasanti was finally able to pursue writing as her full-time career, after spending ten years teaching. Teaching career Speaking of her teaching career in high school, she always broke from tradition and followed her own creative approach to her work, like preparing materials way out of the text books, taking after school lessons and designing unconventional science labs. The results that followed always proved outstanding: one hundred percent students sailed through exams when barely forty percent made it before she taught the class. And this miracle indeed happened in a school at South Bronx, considered one of the poorest congressional districts in New York. \\"Giving back to the community is something I've always felt really strongly about. I believe in karma, that if you put positive energy out into the Universe, you are creating positive energy in your own life\\", writes Susane, the teen-romance writer.

It is a form of partner rape, of domestic violence, and of sexual abuse. Today, marital rape is illegal in all 50 US states, though the details of the offence vary by state. The traditional definition of rape in the United States is the forced sexual intercourse by a male with a \\"female not his wife\\", making it clear that the statutes did not apply to married couples. The 1962 Model Penal Code repeated the marital rape exemption, stating: :A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if: .... Reforms of marital rape laws in the United States began in the mid-1970s with the criminalization of marital rape. The earlier laws of the 1970s often required the husband and wife to no longer be living together for marital rape charges to be brought. The case in the United States that first challenged this cohabitation clause was Oregon v. Rideout in 1978. In the case, the husband was accused of raping his wife, the first man in the United States to be charged with raping his wife while they were still living together. The trial was the first in Oregon relating to marital rape since the state revised its rape law in 1977 to eliminate the marital rape immunity. Although the husband was acquitted of raping his wife, it spurred the movement towards reform. By 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 states. Still, in the 1990s, most states continued to differentiate between the way marital rape and non-marital rape was viewed and treated. The laws have continued to change and evolve, with most states reforming their laws in the 21st century. But there are still states, like South Carolina, where marital and non-marital rape are treated quite differently under the law. To 1993 The views which contributed to rape laws not being applicable in marriage can be traced, at least partially, to 17th century English common law, which was imported to the British American colonies. The 17th-century English jurist, Sir Matthew Hale (1609-1676), stated the position of the common law in The History of the Pleas of the Crown (posthumously, 1736) that a \\"husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their mutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind to her husband which she cannot retract\\". The ruling, although no legal record of which is found earlier than Hale, likely relied on even earlier standards. In a case of Lord Audley's (1488-1544), for instance, he cites the jurist Bracton (c. 1210- c. 1268) in support of this rule, said to derived from laws of King Æthelstan (r. 927-939) where upon the law holds that even \\"were the party of no chaste life, but a whore, yet there may be ravishment: but it is a good plea to say she was his concubine\\".Geis, Gilbert. \\"Rape in Marriage: Law and Law Reform in England, the United States, and Sweden,\\" Adelaide Law Review, 1978; 6(2):285. This would continue to be accepted as a statement of the law in England and Wales until it was overturned by the House of Lords in the case of R. v. R in 1991,R. v. R [1992] 1 AC 599. where it was described as an anachronistic and offensive legal fiction. The strong historical influence of Christianity in the US may have also played a role: the Bible at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a \\"conjugal debt\\" to have sexual relations with one's spouse (in sharp opposition to sex outside marriage which is considered a sin) and states that \\"The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive one another except with consent (...)\\"Biblegateway.com \\\\- and this is interpreted by some conservative religious figures as rejecting the possibility of marital rape.ADN.com In the United States, prior to the mid-1970s marital rape was exempted from ordinary rape laws. The exemption is also found in the 1962 Model Penal Code, which stated that \\"A male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife is guilty of rape if: (...)\\".Wps-prenhall.com In the Oregon v. Rideout case in December 1978, a jury acquitted John Rideout of raping his wife. This led many American states to allow prosecution for marital and cohabitation rape. In some states, courts have struck down the marital exemption as unconstitutional. In the 1984 New York Court of Appeals case of People v. Liberta, judge Sol Wachtler stated that \\"a marriage license should not be viewed as a license for a husband to forcibly rape his wife with impunity. A married woman has the same right to control her own body as does an unmarried woman\\".People v. Liberta 64 N.Y.2d 152, 474 N.E.2d 567, 485 N.Y.S.2d 207(1984) Similarly, in Alabama, the marital exemptions from the sodomy law (Williams v. State (1986)Law.ua.edu ) and from the rape law (Merton v. State (1986)Merton v. State 500 So.2d 1301 (1986)) were found unconstitutional. By 1993, all states had withdrawn the marital rape exemptions, the last states to do so being Oklahoma and North Carolina (both in 1993) or the exemption had been declared judicially to be unconstitutional. Changes since 1993 Although marital rape exemptions had been withdrawn in all states by 1993 or been declared judicially to be unconstitutional, in only 17 states was marital rape treated the same as non-marital rape. In the other states there continued to be significant differences in the way marital and non-marital rape were treated, such as less severe penalties, or excluding situations where no violence is used, or shorter reporting periods.Bergen, Raquel Kennedy, \\"Marital Rape\\" on the site of the Applied Research Forum, National Electronic Network on Violence Against Women. Article dated March 1999. (Retrieved February 8, 2005.)Russell, Diana E.H., Rape in Marriage Macmillan Publishing Company, USA, 1990.Scholarship.law.berkeley.eduHawaii.edu During the 1990s many states differentiated between three categories of victims:Law.bepress.com *Unmarried persons, who had full protection by sexual offenses laws, *Married persons who were in an abnormal marriage (e.g. separated, one spouse had filed for divorce etc.), who were often treated in an intermediate way, although many states treated them either as unmarried persons or as married cohabiting persons, and *Married persons cohabiting (spouses living together under ordinary circumstances), many state laws were initially very restrictive, criminalizing only the \\"worst\\" forms of domestic sexual violence (e.g. requiring violence, a higher level of threat, injury etc.; and often punishing the crime less severely). In the 1990s and beyond, feminists, women's and other organizations have continued to lobby for the amendment of marital rape laws to ensure marital rape is regarded and treated like any other rape, though rape laws in the United States are not uniform, and the laws have changed numerous times, but differences remain in some states. South Carolina, for example, remains the only state where the force or violence used or threatened must be of a higher level (force or violence must be of a \\"high and aggravated nature\\" - see section below Current State laws). A similar law existed in Tennessee until 2005, when it was repealed. The law stated that a person could be guilty of the rape of a spouse at a time they are living together only if that person either \\"was armed with a weapon or any article used or fashioned in a manner to lead the alleged victim to reasonably believe it to be a weapon\\" or \\"caused serious bodily injury to the alleged victim\\". This meant that, in practice, most cases of marital rape could not be prosecuted, since few rapes involve such extreme circumstances. The law was finally repealed in 2005, allowing for marital rape to be treated like any other type of rape.WomenshealthnewsWapp.capitol.tn.govLexisnexis.com The bill to repeal the old law was introduced more than ten times before it succeeded. Until 2013, Washington had an exemption preventing a spouse from being prosecuted with third-degree-rape against the other spouse. Washington removed its exemptions for first-degree rape and second-degree rape in 1983, but the exemption for third-degree rape was removed 30 years later. Until July 2019, in Minnesota sexual violence occurring between spouses at the time they cohabit or between unmarried partners could be prosecuted only if there was force or threat of thereof, due to exemptions created by Article 609.349 'Voluntary relationships'Revisor.mn.gov which stipulated that certain sexual offenses do not apply to spouses (unless they are separated), and neither do they apply to unmarried cohabitants. These are offenses that deal with situations where the lack of consent is due to the incapacity of consent of the victim, including where the victim was drugged by the perpetrator. These situations, which were excluded from prosecution, are where the victim was \\"mentally impaired, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless\\". The term \\"mentally incapacitated\\" is defined as a person who \\"under the influence of alcohol, a narcotic, anesthetic, or any other substance, administered to that person without the person's agreement, lacks the judgment to give a reasoned consent to sexual contact or sexual penetration\\". (see Article 609.341 for definitions).Revisor.mn.gov In 2019, these exemptions were repealed. A 2003 study found that \\"twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have abolished marital immunity for sexual offenses [...] twenty-six states retain marital immunity in one form or another\\".http://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&context;=wps Since 2003, several states have reformed their laws (see above). Current status Some states continue to treat marital and non-marital rape differently: California In California, there are separate criminal offenses for rape (Article 261) and for spousal rape (Article 262). Connecticut Connecticut has a specific crime dealing with forced sex with a spouse and this doesn't apply only to spouses but also to unmarried cohabitants. The law is more narrow than the other sex laws and it has a shorter penalty. It is called Sec. 53a-70b. Sexual assault in spousal or cohabiting relationship and it reads: > No spouse or cohabitor shall compel the other spouse or cohabitor to engage > in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other spouse or > cohabitor, or by the threat of the use of force against such other spouse or > cohabitor which reasonably causes such other spouse or cohabitor to fear > physical injury. The spousal rape law of Connecticut makes reference to force used or threatened against the \\"other spouse or cohabitor\\" while the 'ordinary' sexual assault law deals with force used or threatened against the \\"other person or against a third person\\". Maryland Maryland law states that, if the spouses are living together, a prosecution can take place only if the accused \\"uses force or threat of force and the act is without the consent of the spouse.\\" If the spouses are separated they are treated as if they were strangers (See Section § 3-318) Michigan In Michigan, Section 750.520l excludes situations where the criminality comes solely due to the spouse being \\"mentally incapable, or mentally incapacitated.\\"Legislature.mi.gov Section 750.520a Definitions reads: '\\"Mentally incapacitated\\" means that a person is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person without his or her consent, or due to any other act committed upon that person without his or her consent.'Legislature.mi.gov Mississippi In Mississippi, a person can be convicted of sexual battery of a spouse when they are living together only if he engages in \\"forcible penetration against the victim's will\\".Mscode.com This excludes, among others, situations where the victim is \\"rendered incapable of knowing or controlling his or her conduct, or incapable of resisting an act due to the influence of any drug, narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person without his or her consent\\".Mscode.com Nevada Nevada law appears to require force or threat of force. Article 200.373 states that: \\"It is no defense to a charge of sexual assault that the perpetrator was, at the time of the assault, married to the victim, if the assault was committed by force or by the threat of force.\\"Leg.state.nv.us This seems to imply that if force or threat of thereof were not used, marriage can be a defense. The general definition of sexual assault uses the wording \\"against the will of the victim\\" or \\"under conditions in which the perpetrator knows or should know that the victim is mentally or physically incapable of resisting or understanding the nature of his or her conduct\\". Ohio In Ohio, a rape that happens in marriage when the spouses are living together can only be charged under subsection A(2) of 2907.02 Rape, which states that: \\"No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or threat of force.\\" By contrast, a person who is not married to the accused or who is married but living separate and apart can rely on many laws which deal with various forms of coercion. It is notable that subsection A(1)(a) of 2907.02 Rape that deals with drugging someone \\"surreptitiously or by force, threat of force, or deception\\" to coerce them into sex does not apply in marriage (except in case of separation). The whole article 2907.03 Sexual battery, that deals with various forms of coercion (for instance it states in subsection in A (1) that \\"The offender [commits a crime when he] knowingly coerces the other person to submit by any means that would prevent resistance by a person of ordinary resolution\\") does not apply at all to married people.Codes.ohio.govCodes.ohio.gov In 2015, a bill was introduced to remove these exemptions. Oklahoma In Oklahoma, rape by a spouse can only be charged under subsection (B) of Section 1111 - Rape Defined which states:Oscn.net > B. Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a male or female > who is the spouse of the perpetrator if force or violence is used or > threatened, accompanied by apparent power of execution to the victim or to > another person. For instance, a person in Oklahoma can not charge her/his spouse for rape if she/he is compelled to submit due to drugs \\"administered by or with the privity of the accused as a means of forcing the victim to submit\\", or when she/he is unconscious, as these situations are dealt under subsection (A) of Section 1111 which define rape as intercourse \\"with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator \\". Rhode Island In Rhode Island, Article § 11-37-2 'First degree sexual assault', has four subsections; while subsections 2, 3 and 4 apply to spouses, subsection 1 does not; it reads: \\"The accused, not being the spouse, knows or has reason to know that the victim is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled, or physically helpless.\\"Webserver.rilin.state.ri.us This has the result of excluding from prosecution, among other situations, incidents where the victim was drugged by the perpetrator (\\"Mentally incapacitated\\" is defined by legislation as: \\"a person who is rendered temporarily incapable of appraising or controlling his or her conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or other substance administered to that person without his or her consent, or who is mentally unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the act\\".Webserver.rilin.state.ri.us) South Carolina South Carolina's statute on \\"Assault and Criminal Sexual Conduct\\" (Title 16, Chapter 3, Article 7 of the SC Code of Laws) lays out distinctively different definitions and penalties between rape by a spouse and by other parties. First and second degree sexual assault carries a maximum prison sentence of 30 and 20 years, respectively, while 10 years is the maximum sentence for marital rape. In order to prosecute, the married victim must report the rape within 30 days, even if they are living separately from their spouse. South Carolina Code 16-3-615, titled Spousal sexual battery, reads: \\"Sexual battery, as defined in Section 16-3-651(h), when accomplished through use of aggravated force, defined as the use or the threat of use of a weapon or the use or threat of use of physical force or physical violence of a high and aggravated nature, by one spouse against the other spouse if they are living together, constitutes the felony of spousal sexual battery and, upon conviction, a person must be imprisoned not more than ten years.\\"https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/south- carolina/sc-code/south_carolina_code_16-3-615 This definition does not include all types of force under first degree sexual assault definitions, such as rape combined with felony acts - like forcible confinement, kidnapping, trafficking in persons, or extortion - or cases where the married victim was drugged by their rapist. In the case of criminal sexual conduct when the victim and perpetrator are married but do not live together as a married couple, first and second degree forms of sexual assault are included in the definition of rape, but not third degree forms. So, for example, drugging and raping a spouse from whom you are separated is against the law, but if they are unable to give consent because of substances they took themselves or were given by a third party, having sex with them isn't legally defined as rape. Virginia In Virginia, the main difference lies in punishment. Under certain circumstances, if the victim and the attorney for the Commonwealth agree, the perpetrator can undergo a therapy program, which if completed successfully, replaces any punishment. This can happen if \\"the court finds such action will promote maintenance of the family unit and be in the best interest of the complaining witness.\\"Leg1.state.va.us While the victim has to agree to this option, this can expose the victim to intimidation and threats from the perpetrator, or to social pressure to remain in the relationship. Marriageable age and age of consent Child and forced marriage in the United States have come to increased scrutiny in recent years. Although the general marriage age is 18 in most of the United States, 48 states allow marriage under the age of 18 with parental and/or court consent. Only Delaware and New Jersey have enacted legislation to ban all marriage for minors under the age of 18, without exceptions. Such exceptions can create conflicts between age of consent laws and the marriage age, with most statutory rape laws creating exceptions for minors engaged in a sexual relationship with their lawful spouse - although such minors would otherwise not be able to legally consent to sex. In Iowa, for example, subsection (2) of article 709.4 Sexual abuse in third degree, excludes sexual acts committed by adults with children as young as 12, provided the parties are \\"cohabiting as husband and wife\\".https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/code/2016/709.4.pdf This does not refer only to legal marriages, but can apply to common law marriage as well. Iowa is also one of 10 states, and the District of Columbia, which recognizes common law marriage, though it does also require, \\"substantial evidence of a present intent and agreement to be married, continuous cohabitation, and a public declaration that the parties are husband and wife. In 2012, a man who got his 13-year-old live-in girlfriend pregnant tried to rely on this law. The man, who was of Mexican origin, argued that according to the norms as they exist in his culture, their relationship was “sort of like a trial marriage.” The court rejected this argument, ruling that the exemption could be used only if the couple \\"objectively cohabited in the status of husband and wife, whether common law or otherwise\\", not if they merely believed they did.Statecasefiles.justia.com  References   External links * Marital Rape and the Law Category:Rape in the United States Unted States Category:Domestic violence in the United States Rape ","title":"Marital rape in the United States"},{"id":"39449915","text":"Aslan Kazikovich Tautiyev (; born 25 May 1990) is a Russian football defender.

Prior to playing professionally, Naquin played college baseball for the Texas A&M; Aggies. Early life Naquin attended Klein Collins High School, where he played for the school's baseball team. He lettered in baseball for three years. He was twice honored as All-State, three times honored as All-District, and three times named All-Greater Houston. Naquin grew up a Houston Astros fan. Amateur career The Baltimore Orioles selected Naquin in the 33rd round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. After considering signing with the Orioles, Naquin decided to enroll at Texas A&M; University, to play college baseball for the Texas A&M; Aggies baseball team. Naquin was named the Big 12 Conference Baseball Player of the Year in 2011. Professional career The Cleveland Indians selected Naquin in the first round, with the 15th overall selection, of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He signed and made his professional debut that season with the Mahoning Valley Scrappers of the Rookie-level New York-Penn League, batting .270 in 36 games. Naquin played for the Carolina Mudcats of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League and the Akron Aeros of the Class AA Eastern League in 2013, hitting a combined .269 with ten home runs, 48 RBIs, and 15 stolen bases in 126 total games between both teams. After the 2013 season, the Indians assigned Naquin to the Arizona Fall League, and he participated in the Fall Stars Game. Naquin began the 2014 season with Akron, but suffered a broken hand in July. He required surgery, and missed the remainder of the 2014 season. In 76 games for Akron before his injury, he was batting .313 with four home runs and 30 RBIs. Naquin began the 2015 season with Akron. In June, the Indians promoted him to the Columbus Clippers of the Class AAA International League. However, a concussion and soreness in his right hip limited him to 50 games played with Columbus. In 84 games between Akron and Columbus, he slashed .300/.381/.446 with seven home runs and 27 RBIs. After the 2015 season, the Indians added Naquin to their 40-man roster. After the 2015 season, Naquin remained at the Indians' facility in Arizona to engage in strength training. He competed for a spot on the Indians' 25-man roster during spring training in 2016, and was named to the Opening Day roster. Naquin was named the American League Rookie of the Month for June and July 2016. On August 19, Naquin hit a walk-off inside-the-park home run to lead the Indians to a 3-2 win over the Toronto Blue Jays. He became the first Indians batter to hit a walk off inside-the-park home run since Braggo Roth, who accomplished the feat in 1916. In 116 games, he hit .296 with 14 home runs, 43 RBIs and 18 doubles. Naquin began 2017 with Cleveland. However, he was hampered with injuries and struggled with the Indians, and only appeared in 19 games for Cleveland in which he hit .216. He spent the majority of the year with Columbus where he slashed .298/.359/.475 with ten home runs and 51 RBIs in 80 games. Overall with the 2020 Cleveland Indians, Naquin batted .218 with four home runs and 20 RBIs in 40 games.https://www.mlb.com/player/tyler- naquin-571980?stats=career-r-hitting-mlb&year;=2020 References External links * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Harris County, Texas Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Texas A&M; Aggies baseball players Category:Mahoning Valley Scrappers players Category:Carolina Mudcats players Category:Akron Aeros players Category:Akron RubberDucks players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:People from Spring, Texas ","title":"Tyler Naquin"},{"id":"39449986","text":"Khorramdarreh is a city in Zanjan Province, Iran.

It is derived from either the PowerConnect OS (DNOS 6.x) or Force10 OS/FTOS (DNOS 9.x) and will be made available for the 10G and faster Dell Networking S-series switches, the Z-series 40G core switches and DNOS6 is available for the N-series switches. Two version families The DNOS network operating system family comes in a few main versions: DNOS3 * DNOS 3.x: This is a family of firmware for the campus access switches that can only be managed using a web based GUI or run as unmanaged device. DNOS6 * DNOS 6.x: This is the operating system running on the Dell Networking N-series (campus) networking switches. It is the latest version of the 'PowerConnect' operating system, running on a Linux Kernel. It is available as upgrade for the PowerConnect 8100 series switches (which then become a Dell Networking N40xx switch) and it also is installed on all DN N1000, N2000 and N3000 series switches. It has a full web-based GUI together with a full CLI (command line interface) and the CLI will be very similar to the original PowerConnect CLI, though with a range of new features like PVSTP (per VLAN spanning tree), Policy Based Routing and MLAG. DNOS9 * DNOS 9.x: TeUTg on NetBSD. Only the PowerConnect 8100 will be able to run on DNOS 6.x: all other PowerConnect ethernet switches will continue to run its own PowerConnect OS (on top of VxWorks) while the PowerConnect W-series run on a Dell specific version of ArubaOS. The Dell Networking S- xxxx and Z9x00 series will run on DNOS where the other Dell Networking switches will continue to run FTOS 8.x firmware. OS10 OS10 is a Linux-based open networking OS that can run on all Open Network Install Environment (ONIE) switches. As it runs directly in a Linux environment network admins can highly automate the network platform and manage the switches in a similar way as the (Linux) servers. Hardware Abstraction Layer Three of the four product families from Dell Networking are using the Broadcom Trident+ ASICs, but the company doesn't use the APIs from Broadcom: the developers at Dell Networking have written their own Hardware Abstraction Layer so that DNOS 9.x can run on different hardware platforms with minimal impact for the firmware. Currently three of the four DN switch families are based on the Broadcom Trident family (while the 4th - the E-series- run on self-developed ASICsArchitecture description of the Force10 E-series platform. Force10, 2006. Retrieved: 3 August 2012); and two of them are running DNOS 9.x (S- and Z- series) and if the product developers want or need to use different hardware for new products they only need to develop a HAL for that new hardware and the same firmware can run on it. This keeps the company flexible and not dependent on a specific hardware-vendor and can use both 3rd party or self designed ASICs and chipsets. The underlying OS on which DNOS 9.x, runs, is based on NetBSD (while the DNOS 6.x runs on a Linux kernel), an implementation which is often used in embedded networking-systems. NetBSD is a very stable, open source, OS running on many different hardware platforms. By choosing for a proven technology with extended TCP functionality built into the core of the OS it reduces time during development of new products or extending the DNOS with new features.Force10 FTOS Datasheet, retrieved: 28 January 2012 Modular setup DNOS 9.x is also modular where different parts of the OS run independently from each other within one switch: if one process would fail the impact on other processes on the switch are limited. This modular setup is also taken to the hardware level in some product-lines where a routing-module has three separate CPUs: one for management, one for L2 and one for L3 processing. This same approach is also used in the newer firmware-families from Cisco like the NX-OS for the Nexus product-line or the IOS XR for the high-end routers (the Carrier Routing Systems) from Cisco. (and unlike the original IOS: processes under IOS aren't isolated from each other). This approach is regarded not only a way to make the firmware more resilient but also increases the security of the switchesCommunication Security Establishment Canada (CSEC) on Force10 FTOS 7.8 CSEC report on Security Target: Force10 Networks FTOS 7.8 , published: 17 August 2009, retrieved: 28 January 2012 Capabilities All DNOS 9.x based switches offer a wide range of layer2 and layer3 protocols. All features are available on all switches: some switch models (in the S-series) offer an additional license for layer3 or routing: this additional license is NOT required to use that protocol, but only required to get support from the Dell Networking support department on using these features. All interfaces on DNOS 9.x running switches are configured as a layer3 interface and by default shutdown. To use such an interface as an ethernet switchport you need to configure it as such (with the command \\"switchport\\") and then enable that port using \\"no shutdown\\". Unlike DNOS 6.x (which provide web and CLI - with extensive API control via undocumented \\"dedug console\\" and \\"dev help\\" commands), DNOS 9.x only offers a documented command line interface (CLI) to configure and monitor the switch directly, though it is possible with the \\"Automation Tools\\" to create your own webGui on DNOS 9.x switches. Layer2 capabilities All standardized ethernet standards are supported by switches running FTOS including: Spanning Tree Protocol and RSTP, VLAN and the IEEE 802.1Q standards, QinQ or IEEE 802.1ad, Link Layer Discovery Protocol and LLDP MED. The S-series switches ending with a V and some of the E-series line-cards support Power over Ethernet or PoE with the standards for this protocol. Layer3 capabilities As mentioned above, by default an interface on a switch running DNOS 9.x are configured as a layer3 port. All these switches are thus routers with many interfaces that can (and most often are) reconfigured into a layer2 ethernet switch. All DNOS 9 switches run at least the following routing protocols: Routing Information Protocol and RIP version 2, OSPF, IS-IS and Border Gateway Protocol version 4. Open Automation Under the name OpenAutomation 2.0 Dell Networking switches running DNOS 9.x offers a number of features under this name. These features include:Dell Force10 Open Automation 2.0, visited 29 May 2013 Smart Scripting Dell Networking switches support so called smart scripting. It is possible to develop scripts that run on the switches running DNOS 9. Both Perl and Python are supported as scripting languages to automate environment specific repetitive tasks or to build in custom behavior. Users who write such scripts are promoted to share these scripts with the user-community and make them available to other Force10/DNOS users.Humair Ahmed offering DNOS9 scripts to others. Checked 10 May 2013 Force10 introduced the smart scripting in FTOS in 2010, following other vendors like Cisco for their Nexus product rangeNetworkcomputing.com: F10 enhances open automation framework with...., 9 November 2010. Visited: 29 May 2013 Bare metal provisioning Dell Networking switches support a bare metal provisioning option: if you need to deploy a number of similar switches you can put both (desired/latest) firmware release and standard user-specific configuration on a USB key: when deploying the switches you can insert the USB key, power-up the switch and it will automatically load the correct firmware and configuration. In combination with smart scripting someone can combine these features for a fully automated installation and configuration of new switches. It is also possible to run BMP via the network: unless re-configured to start in 'normal' mode all DNOS 9.x switches (and the earlier FTOS switches) will check if there is a BMP server on the network by sending out a DHCP/BOOTP request at boot: if it gets the correct response from the DHCP server (IP address, address of TFTP server and a script/config file name) it will contact a TFTP server to download correct firmware and configuration files and run that. You can disable this feature during initial configuration so that the switch will boot from the firmware and configuration saved on the switch NVRAM memory. Virtual server networking Part of the Open Automation platform are special features for the use of virtualisation in your datacenter. Virtualisation allows you to create complete (virtual) server-systems running on a standard hypervisor farm. This will create new challenges for networking in such a datacenter, support automated configuration of datacenter switches to connect newly created virtual servers. The open automation platform has several features to support this.Technical Whitepaper: Network automation with F10 Open Automation Framework, downloaded 25 May 2013 Network Automation According to Dell the move to (server and datacenter) virtualisation is one of the most important developments in the IT industry. According to this vendor the industry must prevent that this path leads to getting locked-in into specific vendors due to the use of proprietary technologies.

It was first described and drawn by the Scottish author Dugald Carmichael under the taxonomic name Oscillatoria allata in 1826. In 1833, Miles Joseph Berkeley re-published it under its current name Petalonema alatum. P. alatum produces a slime-like mucopolysaccharide in the form of interlocking slime funnels. The structure looks like a quill under the light microscope, which is where the species gets its name \\"alatum\\", meaning quill. These slime envelopes are up to 270 μm wide in diameter and are therefore visible by the naked eye as filiform formations (\\"nema\\" = floss). The habitats for this filamentous cyanobacterium are mainly wet limestone walls and creates together with other bacteria, microalgae, bryophytes and micromycets gray or gray-brown biofilms/growns. Populations of P. alatum have specialized cells - yellow heterocytes to bind atmospheric nitrogen which are in colour contrast to vegetative blue-green/turquoise cells in filamentous thallus.

Released in 2014 and set in the distant future where the majority of humankind is imprisoned in penal city-states known as Panopticons which wage war against one another, the game involves players cooperating to fight enemies and contribute towards their Panopticon. The game was one of most successful first-party PlayStation Vita titles in Japan, achieving the second highest all-time opening sales for Vita software sold there. Gameplay In-game screenshot showing the combat interface The game is a third-person battle action game, and features local and online multiplayer functionality, both co-operative and competitive, for up to eight players. The game features a grappling whip that the player can use to zip across the battlefield and pull giant enemies to the ground. Different classes of thorns also grant various special techniques, such as traps, healing, and shields. Players fight alongside androids known as Accessories which provide combat support during missions; the player gives a set of commands to their Accessory that they execute, which include holding a position, collecting materials, or rescuing civilians. The game features a system known as the \\"League of Panopticons\\", where players are separated into 47 Panopticons within the Japanese version of the game, with each representing one of Japan's 47 prefectures, and 50 Panopticons representing select global cities within the Asian and western localised releases. Each Panopticon competes with the others in development, where players set out to seek natural resources and invade other Panopticons. Developed Panopticons have the capability to place other ones under their control, and leaderboards are used to compare each City- State. Within this mode, criminals fight amongst other criminals from rival Panopticons. At the end of each mission, players can choose to give the materials they collect to the Panopticon as a \\"contribution\\" which reduces their sentence and adds points to their Panopticon on the leaderboards, or they can keep the material for personal use later on; however, refusal to hand over certain prohibited material will result in the player being penalized with additional years in their sentence. The top few Panopticons with the highest total score are granted special rewards and bonuses. Missions involve players fighting against giant mechanized weapons known as Abductors, and rescuing civilians captured by them. Accessories can be abducted by enemy Abductors once they have fallen, and in such cases the player is required to rescue them. There are also item collection and capture the flag missions. In some missions, players will need to fight against other teams from other Panopticons, and attempt to rescue civilians for their own side. Players collect resources known as abductor parts which fall from enemies, which are used for crafting or contributing to the Panopticon; those who contribute to their Panopticon are rewarded with customisation options for their accessory and player appearance. At the beginning of the game, the player has no rights, and is required to \\"buy\\" back their privileges to do certain things using points gained from contributions in the form of entitlement requests, such as lying down or walking more than five steps in their prison cell, customising their appearance, or having access to certain weapons; violating any restrictions results in a penalty of years being added to the player's sentence. The Japanese and other Asian versions of the game utilise text-to- speech functionality to generate accessory voices triggered during the game which can be customised by the player. Weapons are categorised into six groups, namely small swords, large swords, spears, personal firearms, multipurpose firearms, and squad support firearms. Hammer-type weapons and longswords also fall within the large sword category, sniper rifles, submachine guns and shotguns are included amongst personal firearms, whilst the squad support and multipurpose firearm categories include weapons such as gatling guns, laser guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and net guns. Weapons feature varying degrees of rarity, attributes and perks, and players are able to equip two simultaneously, whilst Accessories are able to equip one. Weapons can be collected off the field, or they can be crafted and enhanced. Consumable items vary from healing items to combat types such as grenades and land mines, and the player can equip boosters which provide in- combat modifiers. Production, modification and strengthening of weapons and consumable items takes up real-world time determined by the Vita's system clock, gives outcomes that are randomised to some degree, and occurs at the weapons plant, medical supply plant, and auxiliary arms plant; resource accumulation and management is an important aspect of the game. The game offers a selection of five different control schemes that cater to different players' suitabilities; the default and dash types are suited to general players of third-person action games, the hunter type is suited to players who prefer the control layout of games such as Monster Hunter and Gods Eater Burst on the PlayStation Portable, which allows the player to control the camera via \\"finger clawing\\" the directional pad as an alternative to the right analog stick, the shooter type is suited to players of third-person shooting games who prefer shooting firearms via the shoulder keys, and the technical type allows the player to switch between actions that bind to the right shoulder key. All control schemes are compatible with DualShock 3 and DualShock 4 controllers, for players using a PlayStation Vita TV. Story Setting Freedom Wars takes place on Earth, in the year 102014.Within the English localisation. The original Japanese version introduces the game as being set in the year 102013. The world surface lies in ruins and is no longer capable of supporting life. As such, humans live in underground cities called \\"Panopticons\\", where they struggle to research how to be able to live on the surface once more. A Panopticon functions as an artificial nation in the form of a city state that provides security for its inhabitants, in exchange for contributions each inhabitant is obligated to make towards the state. This system forms the overall societal structure of each separate Panopticon, which were created following the disintegration and demise of countries. Due to lack of resources, each Panopticon has developed conflicts with others, and large portions of the populace are forced into serving sentences in order for these cities to maintain effective control. All inhabitants of a Panopticon are constantly watched by the state to ensure they abide by the draconian laws put into place, essentially forming a collective of dystopian surveillance societies at war with one another. Criminals serving sentences are forced into providing labor for the state, in the form of participation in war as \\"volunteers\\", in order to regain their freedom. Overpopulation has become such an issue that the Panopticons have implemented a drastic measure: anyone arrested for any crime is found guilty, regardless of whether or not they actually are. Based on the philosophy that newborns waste resources, the very existence of a person is a crime; more than 100 million people serve as criminals throughout the world. Criminals are forced to battle giant monsters called \\"Abductors\\" as punishment. Defeating the Abductors, which are known to capture civilians, reduces the Criminals' sentences, which start at 1,000,000 years. Criminals are placed under constant surveillance and have their rights stripped; personal rights can only be gradually regained through labor. Surveillance of criminals occurs in the form of dual-purpose androids known as Accessories, which watch over criminals whilst serving as partners to them during combat. The player assumes the role of a young male/female customisable protagonist who received a prison sentence of 1,000,000 years for \\"the crime of living\\" upon his/her birth. While in a restricted area deep within the Panopticon, the protagonist stumbles upon and rescues a captive woman named Beatrice Anastasi from a secret facility. She is a human from , a city-state that exists in the sky which has a high degree of civilization and technological prowess that frequently makes incursions and assaults against the humans living on the earth, during events known as . Eventually the protagonist's Panopticon comes under attack from the hostile Hourai Panopticon, home to Abel Balt, one of the world's most powerful criminals. Development Demonstration of the game's unique text to voice functionality used for Accessory customisation. This feature was removed in the North American and European releases. A teaser trailer for the game was released on , which led to the assumption that the game would be named Panopticon. On , the game was revealed to actually be named Freedom Wars. Development for the game began in March 2011, two years before it was first announced to the public in 2013. According to Junichi Yoshizawa, development was distributed amongst the various studios involved; Shift was allocated the task of game and character design, in addition to storywriting, whilst Dimps was responsible for programming, graphics and direction. On , the first playable open beta test of the game was released on the Japanese PlayStation Network. During the SCE Worldwide Studios keynote speech at the 2014 Taipei Game Show, producer Junichi Yoshizawa announced that the game would have a simultaneous release in Japan and Asia, and would also be localised in both Japanese and Traditional Chinese. Sony Computer Entertainment later announced in April 2014 that the game would be localized for a western release. North America and Europe both have physical retail releases of the game. A Korean language localization was also announced, and later released on August 7, 2014. The Chinese-language version of the game released in Taiwan and throughout Southeast Asia was released on the same day. Whilst the Japanese version of the game features a map of Japan's 47 prefectures for its competitive multiplayer mode, the Chinese-localization Asian version was announced to have players select Panopticons from regions such as Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. According to Nick Accordino who is in charge of the western localisation, the English release would feature 50 Panopticons based on cities located around the world. At the Japanese launch, the game features the singleplayer story, free volunteer missions, four-player ad-hoc co-operative play, and Panopticon leaderboard rankings in City-State War mode; later updates after launch introduce new missions and additional features. The 1.04 update patch released on adds changes to game difficulty, including enemy spawning times in certain missions and allowing the thorn to be used whilst dashing. In addition, new control schemes are introduced. The 1.10 patch released on August 1, 2014 introduces infrastructure mode online play, voice chat, invasion missions against enemy Panopticons, and the ability to play story missions with other people. On October 16, 2014, the 1.20 patch introduced support for eight players in online player-versus-player mode, and the Ideology War game mode. The 1.20 update for the western localisation of the game was released on day one of the North American release. Ahead of the 2014 Gamestart Asia convention in Singapore, producer Yoshizawa explained during an interview that the setting of the game is intended to act as a social commentary for modern society, with the game's imprisonment system being used as a comparison with government taxation imposed on a country's citizens, a system that individuals taking part within may often find unreasonable. Media CD cover of Super Contribution Propaganda Music Collection, depicting (from left to right) Opti, Connie and Panna. Two music videos were released on Niconico to promote the game prior to its release, featuring the original songs performed by Shiina Natsukawa, Sora Amamiya and Momo Asakura, and performed by Momo Asakura.

Reception Freedom Wars received Mixed or average reviews according to aggregator Metacritic with a score of 73/100. Famitsu gave Freedom Wars a review score of 35/40. 4gamer notes in their play trial that the game provides tightly packed content with plenty of customisation options. A review by Inside from Japan praised the game for its graphical and overall performance, in addition to the amount of detail placed into the game, however did find that enemy infantry often seemed overpowered during higher missions, raising the difficulty level of the game during these later stages. Destructoid called Freedom Wars the biggest PS Vita release in 2014. IGN's Colin Moriarty writes that the game features plenty of content to keep the player occupied, and never forces them to play alone or online, allowing the player to choose their own pace progressing through the game. Hardcore Gamer rated the game 3.5 out of 5, describing it as a solid action RPG with good premise and deep themes, albeit feeling repetitive at times. PlayStation Universe gave Freedom Wars an 8.5/10 score, noting that the narrative and customization were positive aspects, even though the endgame relies on a large amount of grinding. PS Nation notes that the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are enjoyable overall, and that the game plays well on a PlayStation TV device, giving a score of 9/10. Metro gave a score of 6/10 stated \\"There’s plenty of potential here, to make a Monster Hunter clone Western gamers can really get behind, but all its best ideas are sacrificed to endless grinding and repetition.\\" Sales The game sold 188,888 physical retail copies within the first week of release in Japan, taking first place within the Japanese software sales rankings for that particular week, and maintaining the top charting position for the first two weeks in a row due to continued high sales during the following week immediately after.

Intended to screen the main fleet against attacking torpedo boats, Meteor was armed with a battery of four guns. Her design suffered from several defects, including excessive vibration and poor handling in heavy seas, both of which could not be corrected. These problems limited the ship's career. She served briefly as a guard ship in Kiel in 1892, as an aviso with the main fleet in 1893–1894, and as a fishery protection ship in 1895–1896. Out of service by the end of 1896, Meteor was later used as a harbor defense vessel in 1904 and then as a barracks ship from 1911 to 1919, when she was sold to ship breakers and dismantled. Design Meteor during her short active career With previous avisos built for the German fleet, the designers had attempted to build vessels that could serve as scouts for the main fleet as well as defend it against hostile torpedo boats that threatened the larger ironclad warships. The naval command decided in 1888 that the next class of avisos—the Meteor design—should focus solely on anti-torpedo boat duties. Smaller and faster than the preceding s, the Meteors were also badly unstable and poor sea boats, and they suffered from severe vibration at high speed. These defects could not be remedied, and as a result, they had short careers. Meteor was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward. She displaced as designed and up to at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two vertical 3-cylinder triple expansion engines. Steam for the engines was provided by four coal-fired locomotive boilers. The ship's propulsion system was rated for and provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Meteor had a crew of 7 officers and 108 enlisted men. As built, the ship was armed with four SK L/30 guns placed in single pivot mounts, two side-by-side forward, and two side-by-side aft. The guns were supplied with between 462 and 680 rounds of ammunition. Meteor also carried three torpedo tubes, one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck-mounted launchers on the broadside. She was protected with a thick deck, along with of steel armor plating for the conning tower. Service history Lithograph of (left), Meteor (center), and (right) by Willy Stöwer Work on Meteor began in December 1888 with her keel laying at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel. She was launched on 20 January 1890; after completing fitting-out, dockyard workers conducted builder's trials before delivery. After these were finished, she was commissioned into the fleet on 15 May 1891. She was initially used as the flagship of the commander of the Marinestation der Ostsee (Baltic Sea Naval Station) and was stationed as a guard ship in Kiel, replacing the screw corvette in the roles. The navy had not yet conducted its own trials of the ship, however, and she was transferred to I Reserve on 30 July, her role as flagship being taken over by the torpedo training ship . Meteor returned to guard duties from 28 August to 3 October, at which point she was decommissioned to correct some defects that had been discovered during her trials, including increasing the height of her funnels by to reduce smoke interference with the aft gun crews. Meteor was recommissioned on 20 May 1892 for another round of trials after the modifications completed the previous year. She was also assigned as the guard ship for Kiel during this period. In mid-August, she took part in the annual fleet training exercises that lasted until 26 September. During the maneuvers, she served as the flotilla leader for II Torpedo-boat Flotilla; the flotilla commander, Korvettenkapitän (KK—corvette captain) Karl Rosendahl, flew his flag aboard the ship for the duration of the exercises. Kaiser Wilhelm II boarded the ship for a short cruise in early November, and she was decommissioned again on 6 December, by which time the navy pronounced the ship's trials to be officially completed. She was recommissioned on 5 April 1893 to serve as the aviso for I Division of the Maneuver Fleet from 1 May to 29 September, including during the annual maneuvers. KK Henning von Holtzendorff served as the ship's commander during this period. Beginning on 30 June 1894, she escorted the Kaiser's yacht Hohenzollern on his annual summer cruise, which went to Norway that year. While in Stavanger, Meteor suffered from machinery problems, though her crew was able to repair her engines there. The problems nevertheless led to her being replaced as the Kaiser's escort by the protected cruiser . Meteor returned to Kiel for repairs, after which she served as a scout during the fleet maneuvers. She was decommissioned again on 30 September. Meteor returned to active service on 19 March 1895 for fishery protection duties along Germany's North Sea coast. These operations were interrupted from 14 to 22 June, when she attended the ceremonial opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. On 27 August, she was transferred to the Maneuver Fleet for the annual exercises. Decommissioned again on 24 September for the winter months, Meteor was recommissioned on 18 March 1896 for fishery protection. She waited in Dover, Great Britain, from 17 to 24 April for Prince Heinrich to arrive to take his new sailing yacht back to Germany. She then returned to the fisheries patrol, where British fishers were repeatedly violating German territorial waters off Norderney, forcing Meteor to intervene and drive them off. At the end of May, Meteor began to serve as a training ship for engine and boiler room crews in addition to her patrol duties. She met British and Dutch fishery patrol vessels in Lowestoft, Great Britain, from 3 to 6 July. Beginning on 9 August, Meteor took part in fleet maneuvers for the last time; these lasted until early September, when she returned to fishery patrols. Decommissioned on 4 October, the ship's active career was now over. The ship's poor seaworthiness militated against further use with the fleet. And she was not particularly suited to the fishery protection duties that had occupied much of her active career, since her small size prevented her from carrying sufficient coal to remain at sea for long periods; she was replaced in that role by the old aviso of 1876 vintage. Meteor was reclassified as a light cruiser in 1899 and was transferred to the list of harbor ships on 3 May 1903. Beginning on 3 May 1904, she was assigned as a harbor guard ship. Struck from the naval register on 24 June 1911, she was reduced to a barracks ship based in Kiel, where she remained for the next eight years, including during World War I, when she was occupied by U-boat crews. After the German defeat, the ship was sold for scrapping in 1919. Meteor thereafter was broken up in Rendsburg.

Intended to screen the main fleet against attacking torpedo boats, Comet was armed with a battery of four guns. Her design suffered from several defects, including excessive vibration and poor handling in heavy seas, both of which could not be corrected. These problems limited the ship's career to several periods of sea trials as the navy attempted to remedy the problems that plagued the ship. They had no success, and Comet was instead decommissioned in mid-1896 and was later converted into a storage hulk for naval mines. She was ultimately broken up in 1921. Design Comets sister ship With previous avisos built for the German fleet, the designers had attempted to build vessels that could serve as scouts for the main fleet as well as defend it against hostile torpedo boats that threatened the larger ironclad warships. The naval command decided in 1888 that the next class of avisos—the Meteor design—should focus solely on anti-torpedo boat duties. Smaller and faster than the preceding s, the Meteors were also badly unstable and poor sea boats, and they suffered from severe vibration at high speed. These defects could not be remedied, and as a result, they had short careers. Comet was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of forward.

Comet also carried three torpedo tubes, one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck-mounted launchers on the broadside. She was protected with a thick deck, along with of steel armor plating for the conning tower. Service history The contract for Comet was awarded to the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin, but her keel laying was delayed until November 1891 so the navy could gather experience from the initial trials of Comets sister ship, . The commander of the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel, Otto von Diederichs performed the christening at her launching ceremony on 15 November 1892. After completing fitting-out, the navy conducted acceptance trials that concludd on 14 April 1893. The ship then steamed to Kiel, where she was commissioned on 29 April. She conducted further sea trials until 6 July, when she was decommissioned for the year. Comet was recommissioned briefly in 1894, serving briefly from 5 to 30 June under the command of Korvettenkapitän (corvette captain) Henning von Holtzendorff. The ship remained out of service through 1895, though modifications were made in an attempt to correct some of her defects. She was recommissioned on 22 January for another round of sea trials that lasted until 26 April. These were conducted in the North Sea, under the command of Kapitänleutnant (captain lieutenant) Ludwig Bruch. The ship was transferred to Wilhelmshaven on 2 May, where she was decommissioned again. Relocated to Kiel the following year, she saw no further active service. As with her sister, Comets career was limited by the serious defects in her design. An order from the naval command reclassified Comet as a light cruiser on 21 February 1899, and in mid-1901, she was transferred to Danzig, along with three other old ships. On 3 May 1904, she was transferred to the list of harbor ships, and she was employed as a harbor defense ship in Danzig beginning at the same time. The ship was struck from the naval register on 24 June 1911 and in June 1914, she was towed to Emden, where she was used as a mine storage hulk to support the light cruiser . Comet was broken up in Hamburg in 1921.

During the Second World War and after Simiutak was the site of a U.S. Navy facility code-named 'Bluie West 3'. Geography Simiutaq is located south of the mouth of the Ikersuaq fjord in the Julianehab Bay, Labrador Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, near Qaqortoq. Its name is a generic Inuit name for an island at the head of a fjord. It should not be confused with another Simiutak (aka 'Cruncher Island') in western Greenland that served as a support station for Sondrestrom Air Base, and known as 'Bluie West 9'. Map of Greenland section showing Simiutak Island Radio station The station at Simiutak Island, commonly referred to as Bluie West 3 (BW-3) during the time of American operation, was a major wartime radio communications and meteorological facility on the southwest coast of Greenland, marking the entrance to the fjords that led to Narsarsuaq and Julianehaab. The U.S. Army facility was operational long into the post-war era. Four miles east from Simiutak was the U.S. Navy station Gamatron, which was abandoned after the war. Foundation The U.S. Coast Guard searched for a suitable site for a radio direction finding (RDF) site in the Julianehaab area in July 1941, to serve as an auxiliary for sea traffic and anticipated air traffic associated with the BW-1 base which began construction that month. Coast Guard documents show the ship Algonquin arriving from Boston with a radio beacon for Site A (Gamatron) in November. The cutter North Star searched for a construction site and transported men and equipment there. Construction of Gamatron and Simiutak was carried out simultaneously in November and December 1941 and expanded as needed thereafter. On 13 December, USCGC North Star left having erected supplies and temporary housing. USCGC Raritan supported the construction of nearby BW-3.U.S. Coast Guard War Diary, 1940-1945. Operation Gamatron was in partial operation from 10 January 1942 and in full operation from 30 March. On 15 August BW-3 was declared in full operation and simultaneously, nearby aircraft guard station \\"C\\" (ship) was abandoned. Cruncher Island (BW-9) was built June - August 1942. On 4 September the Light and Radio Beacon were declared operational.Building the Navy's Bases in World War II. U.S. Navy History. BW-3 became an essential navigation aid for ships and aircraft. A non-directional beacon (NDB) was situated there to provide a coastal fix for aircraft attempting the BW-1 approach. A weather station reported aviation weather. A high frequency (HF) communications site was set up to communicate with aircraft over a wide area. Gamatron was listed as having a camp for one officer and forty enlisted men. After the United States Air Force left BW-3, agencies of the Danish government took over and operated the site for many years. While there is no native population close by, the site was frequently visited by vessels transiting the area. In 1945, the U.S. State Department defined the Simiutak Defense Area as the entire island of Simiutak situated at the mouth of Skovfjord at approx. 6041N and 4634W and the adjacent waters for a distance of one mile for the shore line. The nearby naval facility of Gamatron was defined similarly as the unnamed (Gamatron) Island lying south of Hollaender Island at approx. 6040N and 4626W and the islands and waters adjacent thereto for a distance of one mile from the shoreline.

She had one sister ship, . Wacht was built by the AG Weser shipyard; she was laid down in 1886, launched in August 1887, and commissioned in August 1888. She served in the active fleet through the 1890s and participated in numerous training exercises. Her career was cut short on 4 September 1901, when she collided with the old ironclad . The latter's ram bow holed Wacht under the waterline and caused her to rapidly sink. Her crew was safely rescued, however, and there were no casualties. Design With the selection of General Leo von Caprivi to replace the former chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralität (Imperial Admiralty), Albrecht von Stosch, in 1883, the navy began to experiment more seriously with torpedo-armed warships along the lines of the Jeune École. Caprivi was a proponent of cheaper torpedo boats, and he directed that future avisos should forsake size and gun power in favor of higher speed and torpedo armament.

Wacht also carried three torpedo tubes, one mounted submerged in the bow and the other two in deck-mounted launchers on the broadside. In 1891, four SK L/30 guns in single mounts were installed in place of the 10.5 cm guns. The ship was the first German aviso to carry armor: a thick deck, along with of armor plating for the conning tower. Service history Construction – 1892 Wacht early in her career The keel for Wacht was laid down in August 1886 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen. She was launched on 27 August 1887 and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Alexander von Monts, the chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) christened the ship. In early 1888, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where her armament was installed, and she was commissioned on 9 August to begin sea trials. These concluded on 13 December in Wilhelmshaven. She was temporarily assigned to the newly-created Reserve Division of the North Sea over the winter of 1888–1889 before being transferred to Kiel on 1 May to begin engine trials, after which she was assigned to the Maneuver Squadron. During training exercises with the squadron, Wacht suffered a burst boiler tube on 20 June that forced her to return to port for repairs. In early August, she joined the squadron for a visit to Britain, arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 31 August. The fleet then conducted its annual large-scale maneuvers. After the maneuvers ended in September, Korvettenkapitän (KK—Corvette Captain) Friedrich von Baudissin took command of the vessel. Late in the year, Wacht joined a squadron of four old ironclads--, , , and that escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II and Kaiserin Augusta Victoria aboard their yacht Hohenzollern to Greece for the wedding of Princess Sophie, the Kaiser's sister, to Constantine, then the crown prince of the Kingdom of Greece. Prince Heinrich also cruised with the squadron aboard the protected cruiser . During the cruise, the Germans visited numerous ports in the Mediterranean, including state visits to Italy, the Ottoman Empire, followed by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. While in Trieste in Austria-Hungary, the squadron was present for a naval review for the Austro-Hungarian Kaiser Franz Joseph I in Muggia. Wacht developed boiler problems that necessitated repairs at the naval arsenal at Pola; she remained there until 29 January 1890, when she was able to get underway again. She met the rest of the squadron in Malta on 1 February, but left for home independently, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 22 February, while the rest of the squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April. Wacht had in the meantime been decommissioned there on 6 March. Wacht in 1888 While out of service, the ship underwent a thorough overhaul and had her gun armament replaced. On 6 October 1891, she was recommissioned for sea trials that lasted until the end of February 1892; during this period, her commander was KK Hermann da Fonseca-Wollheim. She was assigned to II Division of the Maneuver Squadron on 8 March and KK Ludwig Borckenhagen relieved Fonseca-Wollheim, Wacht thereafter taking part in exercises in the North Sea off the coast of Norway. She was detached from the unit to escort Hohenzollern from 4 to 8 June while Wilhelm II visited Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. Later in the year, the ship had a minor collision with the artillery training ship . Borckenhagen left the ship in September and Wacht was decommissioned on 12 October. 1893–1901 Wacht was recommissioned on 13 January 1893, initially serving as a training ship for engine and boiler room crews for torpedo boats. Kapitänleutnant (Captain Lieutenant) Alfred Ehrlich commanded the ship during the year. In early March, she was reassigned to serve as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats, and in mid-April, she was once again detached to escort Hohenzollern, though this was the new yacht of that name, while it was being taken from Swinemünde to Kiel. While on the way, the vessels encountered the Flensburg-flagged merchant ship that had run aground and Wacht pulled her free and towed er to Kiel. Ten days later, the navy established I Torpedo-boat Flotilla, based in Kiel; Wacht served as the flotilla leader and flagship of KK Gustav Schmidt. The unit consisted of two divisions and included twelve torpedo boats in total. The vessels conducted training maneuvers over the next two months and in early July, Wacht cruised with the Maneuver Squadron in the North Sea. The annual fleet maneuvers were held from 20 August to 23 September in the North and Baltic Seas, and upon their conclusion, I Torpedo-boat Flotilla was dissolved for the year. On 27 September, Wacht accompanied Hohenzollern on her sea trials that included visits to Gothenburg, Karlskrona, and Christiansand in Sweden–Norway. Wacht then returned to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 11 October. The German fleet at anchor in 1896; the four s are at right and either Wacht or is at anchor in front (left distance) In 1894, Wacht was assigned to II Division of the Maneuver Squadron; during this period, the ships conducted a lengthy cruise in the North Sea, visiting ports in Norway and the Shetland Islands from 3 April to late June. While steaming out of Kiel on 2 July, Wacht was accidentally rammed by the ironclad . Wacht had to enter the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel for repairs that lasted until 23 July. She took part in the annual fleet maneuvers from 19 August to 21 September, after which she traded assignments with the aviso , which had been the aviso for I Division. At the same time, KK Eduard Holzhauer took command of the vessel. Wacht did not remain in service with the unit long, owing to the poor condition of her engines, and she was decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 8 December for repairs. The ship remained out of service until 18 March 1896, when she was recommissioned under the command of KK Carl Friedrich, being assigned to II Division eight days later; by this time, the Maneuver Squadron had been renamed I Squadron. The ships embarked on a cruise to the Netherlands and Norway that lasted until the end of the May. Squadron exercises followed in June and July and the fleet maneuvers were held from 9 August to 15 September. During these exercises on 5 September, Wacht damaged her screws in a collision with the torpedo boat , forcing her to return to Kiel for repairs, though she was able to take part in the final stage of the maneuvers in the North Sea. She thereafter cruised through the Kattegat in mid-December to return to Kiel, where Friedrich left the ship. On 1 January 1897, her crew was reduced, though it was replenished on 1 March to take the ship back to Wilhelmshaven in 1897, where on 4 May she was decommissioned again. During that brief period in commission, KK Otto Mandt commanded the vessel. While out of service, she was reclassified as a \\"Kleiner Kreuzer\\" (small cruiser) on 27 February 1899; she was recommissioned on 6 April to replace the aviso in II Division. While on maneuvers at the end of the month, she damaged one of her screws. Squadron exercises followed in July and in August, the annual fleet maneuvers began. Wacht served as a fleet scout during the exercises until 12 September, when she suffered a boiler explosion that killed four men and injured another five. The ironclad towed her to Kiel for temporary repairs before she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven. There, she was decommissioned on 27 September. Loss Wacht was recommissioned on 11 August 1901 under the command of KK Hugo von Cotzhausen and was assigned to I Scouting Group six days later. The unit operated with II Squadron in the North Sea in August, and on the last day of the month, the fleet maneuvers began in the Baltic. While the ships were steaming through Danzig Bay on 4 September, the fleet commander ordered Wacht and the small cruiser to pass from the seaward side of the line to the other so that signals from the ships could be relayed to shore. Wacht attempted to pass between the ironclads and but Wachts helmsman misjudged the distance and passed too closely in front of Sachsen. Sachsen immediately attempted to reverse course to avoid ramming the ship, but the two vessels collided. Sachsens ram bow tore a large hole in Wachts port side, which began to slowly sink. The battleship attempted to tow Wacht to shallow water, but several of Wachts internal bulkheads collapsed under the strain and the ship quickly sank. Nevertheless, her crew was taken off safely; neither ship suffered any casualties. The navy later attempted to raise the ship, which had sunk at a depth of more than , but the efforts proved fruitless. A court martial was held for Cotzhausen on 8 October, who was acquitted of any wrong-doing in the accident.

She was christened at her launching ceremony by Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Karl August Deinhard on 7 July 1888. After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned for sea trials on 25 June 1889 under the command of Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Max Piraly, which ended on 6 April in Kiel, where she was decommissioned on 6 August. She was recommissioned on 15 April for additional trials that lasted until the end of June. She then escorted Hohenzollern, the yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm II, during his summer cruise to Norwegian waters. After returning to Germany, she was stationed in Kiel as a guard ship from 1 August to 11 September. The ship then moved to Wilhelmshaven, where she was decommissioned on 3 October, thereafter receiving her new gun battery of 8.8 cm guns. The ship returned to service in 1891, initially as a guard ship in Wilhelmshaven, during which time she conducted a cruise along Germany's North Sea coast. She thereafter join Hohenzollern for a visit to Amsterdam, Netherlands and then to ports in Norway. During the annual fleet maneuvers held in August and September, she served with the fleet and was tasked with relaying signals between units. She took part in the 1892 fleet maneuvers and beginning on 13 October, she returned to guard duties in Wilhelmshaven. The year 1893 passed uneventfully, and she was decommissioned for a modernization that included replacing her boilers at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven. The work lasted into 1894, and upon completion she remained in reserve. The German fleet at anchor in 1896; the four s are at right and either Jagd or is at anchor in front (left distance) Jagd was recommissioned on 8 March 1895 under the command of KK Eduard Holzhauer, and in late April, she was the first vessel to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, before the canal officially opened. She was sent through the canal to determine if it was ready for use; the canal was officially opened on 20 June. Jagd thereafter served with the Maneuver Squadron as an aviso for the rest of the year, and in September, Holzhauer was replaced by KK Carl Friedrich. The ship was then decommissioned in Wilhelmshaven on 19 December. Recommissioned in March 1896 under KK Guido von Usedom, she served in the same role, albeit for what was now I Squadron, for the duration of 1896; during the year, the squadron visited the Netherlands and Norway before being decommissioned in September. KK Hermann Lilie relieved Usedom in September and remained in command during the period in reserve. Recommissioned on 5 March 1897, she again took her place with the squadron, taking part in the fleet maneuvers. Following their conclusion, Lilie left the ship, his place being taken by KK Fritz Sommerwerck. Unlike previous years, she remained in commission through the winter and was withdrawn from service again on 8 March 1898. The ship next saw active service on 27 September 1899, when she was recommissioned to replace her sister ship as the aviso for I Squadron. She remained in service through 1900, though after the fleet maneuvers she was used for fishery protection duties in the North Sea from 14 October to 23 November. She underwent an overhaul in January 1901, and from 28 January to 7 February, she joined the unit that was sent to represent Germany during the funeral ceremonies for Queen Victoria of Britain, who was Wilhelm II's grandmother. KK Hugo von Cotzhausen took command of the ship in March. Following the grounding of the battleship off the Adlergrund north of Rügen, Jagd was used to survey the area. Following the conclusion of this work, the navy conducted an examination of Jagd in mid-July and determined that the ship was in such poor condition that she was not worth refitting. She was accordingly decommissioned for the last time on 11 August. Jagd was transferred to the list of harbor ships on 3 May 1904, thereafter being used as a harbor ship. She was struck from the naval register on 14 May 1910 and subsequently hulked. She was based in Friedrichsort outside Kiel and used as a firing platform for torpedo training until she was broken up for scrap in 1920 at Rüstringen.

Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER) Despite its names, it is not related to the buttercups or the alders. It is native to Central and South America, from Panama south to Brazil. It is well known in many other places as an introduced species, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, several other Pacific Islands, the Caribbean, and Florida in the United States. It is commonly cultivated as a garden flower. Growth This plant is a perennial herb growing from a thick taproot and woody stem base. It reaches a maximum height around . The leaves are roughly oval in shape with toothed edges. The undersides are glandular and coated in white hairs. The upper surfaces may be somewhat hairy, as well. The leaves are up to long. Flowers occur in the leaf axils, borne in calyces of hairy, glandular sepals. The petals are rounded to oval, the longest exceeding . They are white or yellowish with darker bases. The dark patches at the bases are nectar guides. The center of the flower is rough, feeling like a cat's tongue. The fruit is a hairy capsule containing seeds with white arils. The seeds are dispersed by ants, who are likely attracted to their high lipid content.Simberloff, D. and M. Rejmanek, Eds. Encyclopedia of Biological Invasions. University of California Press. 2010. pg 589. The plant is pollinated by a variety of insects, including the bee Protomeliturga turnerae, which is oligolectic, specializing on this plant species and depending completely on it for reproduction. The male bee builds his territory around the plant, for example. Thus, this particular bee is a common pollinator of the flowers. Other insects observed at the plant include many other bee species, such as Trigona spinipes, Frieseomelitta doederleinii, and Plebeia flavocinta, butterflies such as Nisoniades macarius and Urbanus dorantes, and the beetle Pristimerus calcaratus. Appearance Like most other Turnera, this species is heterostylous, with two morphs. The \\"pin\\" morph has long styles in its flowers, while the \\"thrum\\" morph has short styles. Both morphs produce the same amount of pollen. One study reported that during pollination, pin flowers receive more pollen from thrum flowers than from other pin flowers. The genes that cause this dimorphism in style size are the subject of current research. So far, it has been established that short styles contain proteins, polygalacturonases, that are absent in long styles. Traditional medicine This plant has uses in traditional medicine.

Allegedly executed and supervised by General Javed Nasir, the program distributed and coordinated the systematic supply of arms to ARBiH during the war. The ISI Bosnian contingent was organized with financial assistance provided by Saudi Arabia, according to the British historian Mark Curtis. Pakistan declared in a meeting of Muslim countries at Geneva in July 1995 that the UN arms embargo was illegal. Farooq Leghari, then president of Pakistan, stated that 'the Western policy of appeasement of the Serbian aggressors is not going to pay.' Pakistan subsequently declared that it would provide weapons to the Bosnian government in spite of the UN arms embargo. Pakistan became the fourth largest contributor of troops to the UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and pledged to keep its soldiers there to protect Bosnian Muslims and confront the Serbs while France and other countries wanted to withdraw their troops for the safety of their soldiers. Nasir later confessed that, despite the UN arms embargo in Bosnia, the ISI airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to ARBiH which turned the tide in favor of Bosniaks and forced the Serbs to lift the siege. In 2011, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia demanded the custody of the former ISI director for his alleged support to forces of the Bosnian government against the Army of Republika Srpska in the 1990s, the Government of Pakistan has refused to hand Nasir to the UN tribunal, citing poor health. During the height of the conflict, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry evacuated many endangered Bosnians from the conflict areas who immigrated to Pakistan. The small nature of the program was mentioned and highlighted in the Pakistani drama, Alpha Bravo Charlie in 1998. Since then, foreign relations have improved between Pakistan and Bosnia.

Prize-linked savings is the concept of using the chance to win a prize to incentivize personal savings. A prize-linked savings account or PLSA (also called a lottery-linked deposit account) is a savings account where some of the interest payment on bank deposits or marketing dollars are distributed as prizes based on chance. They are attractive to consumers as they function both as a sweepstakes or game of chance (as there is a chance of a large prize) and as savings (the deposit is never lost, unlike normal lotteries) vehicle. PLSAs are similar to lottery bonds except they are offered by banks, credit unions, prepaid card companies, and FinTechs, and can be held for a period of time determined by the consumer. Sometimes the returns are in- kind prizes rather than cash. PLSAs have attracted customers who were, hitherto, familiar with only raffles or lotteries, but now were guaranteed saving security as well as promised an attractive incentive in the form of lotteries. It is, as the press quoted, a \\"no-loss lottery\\". The PLSA program in Michigan, USA, \\"Save to Win\\", was introduced in 2009 as a full scale demonstration by Commonwealth, (formerly D2D Fund Inc.), Filene Research Institute, and the Michigan Credit Union League following research by Peter Tufano from Harvard Business School, who co-founded Commonwealth in 2001. During this research, 56% of the participants were non-savers before the program. PLSAs have been the source of some controversy as some state ran lottery boards have claimed that PLSAs infringe upon their rights, although as time progresses we are seeing more and more states working with institutions to roll out this financial vehicle. United States Examples of prize-linked savings in the credit union space include: * Lucky Savers (New York) * Lucky Lagniappe (Louisiana) * Neighborhood Credit Union (Texas) * Save to Win (Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington) * Saver's Sweepstakes (Wisconsin) * WINcentive Savings (Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota) *Big Prize Savings (California) Save to Win (from the Michigan Credit Union League) and WINcentive (operated by the Minnesota Credit Union Network) are the two largest credit union PLS products. Both operate as multi-institution models meaning multiple credit unions can offer the product and share the prize pool. Examples of prize-linked savings in banks include: * Jackpot Savings from Blue Ridge Bank in Virginia * FirstPrize $avings from First County Bank in Connecticut * Win-Win CD from Community Bank offered in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington state *Lucky Piggy Savings from BankFive in Massachusetts Examples of prize-linked savings direct to consumer FinTech apps include PrizePool, Flourish Savings, Yotta Savings, Long Game, WinWin, and Grand. Prize Savings was launched in 2016 on the Walmart MoneyCard (a reloadable prepaid debit card) in partnership with Commonwealth and Green Dot Bank. Each dollar saved in a cardholder’s Vault (savings pocket) earns an entry into monthly drawings for one of 999 prizes of $25 or one $1,000 grand prize. Every Vault user is automatically entered to participate. In the first year alone, over 200,000 people have used the MoneyCard Vault and saved over $500 million. Two years after the launch of the Vault and Prize Savings, customers had moved $2 billion through the MoneyCard Vault, their savings increased by 35% on average, and there was a 274% increase in usage. The American Savings Promotion Act was signed into law in 2014 opening the door for all financial institutions to be included in state-level legislation. To date, 33 states have passed legislation or taken legal action to ensure banks and credit unions (or in some states, only credit unions) can offer savings promotion raffles. As of December 2019, states that allow banks and credit unions to offer PLS via savings promotion raffles: States that allow banks: * Alabama * Arkansas *California * Connecticut * Delaware *Georgia * Hawaii * Illinois * Indiana * Kansas * Kentucky * Maine * Maryland * Massachusetts * Michigan * Minnesota * Missouri * Montana * Nebraska * New Jersey * New York * Oregon * South Carolina * Texas - approved in 2017 with the passage of proposition 7 * Utah *Virginia * Washington * Wisconsin As of April 2019, legislation has been introduced in Vermont (H. 148) and Pennsylvania (HB 858). States that allow credit unions to offer PLS: * Arizona * Louisiana * North Carolina *Ohio * Rhode Island Prize-linked savings accounts have the potential to help combat low rates of savings among Americans. They offer more incentive than a traditional savings account as an individual may be discoursed earning a low rate of return in a standard savings account. US families that play the lottery all tend to spend roughly the same amount regardless of economic status. Because of this, those falling in the low end of the economic distribution have the potential to see true growth of personal savings through the use of a PSLA. Around the world Prize-linked savings accounts have been offered in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Oman, Pakistan, Spain, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. In South Africa, the First National Bank created a program called the Million a Month Account (MAMA), aimed at increasing savings accounts among unbanked people. It was later closed after the state-run lottery sued them for infringing upon their monopoly. In Iran, PLSAs are the most common form of savings account available to the public, as they are viewed to be in compliance with Islamic law which forbids one to earn guaranteed interest on assets. See Islamic banking  Economics of prize linked savings  The success of the prize linked savings account can be attributed to several concepts studied in the field of behavioral economics. One such concept is the availability heuristic. Essentially people are likely to associate and have faith in things which readily come to mind, such as winning a lottery, as lottery winners are prevalent in media. Another behavioral economic concept which contributes to the success of prize linked savings is the sunk cost fallacy. This is displayed in prize linked savings as people who use these accounts will often save an increasing amount of money to up their odds in winning the prize, regardless of how small the odds are. The misunderstanding of small probabilities also can be attributed to the success of prize linked savings as it is nearly impossible for any individual to fathom odds in the millions as our day to day lives deal with quantities going no higher than a few thousand. The demand for prize linked savings accounts is seen to be highest amongst those with relatively low savings. This group of individuals is also more prone to gambling so Prize-Linked savings accounts have more potential to induce savings in this population. Skewness also plays into the appeal of PLSAs as it is essentially the idea that there is some chance to win a big prize with possible odds that could be realized (although they are small).  Institutional appeal of prize linked savings  Prize linked savings account have several appeals to financial institutions which other savings and investment vehicles do not offer. The first of which is ease of marketing. While it may be difficult for a banker to make a traditional savings account sound anything but drab, a PLSA has lottery like factor to it which could easily be sold to consumers. Also PLSAs are not very complex in their investment strategy and typically go for risk-averse vehicles so they often require less effort and maintenance on behalf of the institution. They offer the consumer transparency and legitimacy as the institution can consistently offer the same prize through the adjustment of odds in relation to the amount of interest being made on the collective fund. Finally, PLSAs can maximize the liquidity of their consumers by denying those who frequently make withdrawals eligibility to win prizes.

Other characters include Shamira \\"the Witch of Endor\\", which helps the historic journey to the apocalypse. With a total of 586 pages, the book is divided into 3 parts titled The Holy Avenger, The Wrath of God and the Scourge of Fire. In 2011, the book was released in the Netherlands, under the name Engelen van Apocalyps.  Plot  In the distant past, the Celestial Paradise was the scene of a terrible uprising. A group of warrior angels, lovers of justice and freedom, challenged the tyranny of the powerful archangels, raising arms against their oppressors. Expelled, the renegades were forced into exile, and condemned to wander the world of men until the final judgement. But then comes the moment of Revelation, the time of reckoning, the day of the awakening of the Most High. Ablon, sole survivor of the purge and leader of the renegades, is invited by Lucifer, to join his legions in the battle of Armageddon, the final struggle between Heaven and Hell, the war that will decide not only the fate of the world, but the future of the universe. From the ruins of Babylon to the splendour of the Roman Empire, from the vast plains of China to the frozen castles in medieval England. A Batalha do Apocalipse is not just a journey through human history, but also a journey of knowledge, an exciting epic, full of heroic struggles, magic, romance and suspense.  The Book  A constant journey between past, present and future the author begins the book introducing us to two important characters of his story: the archangels Michael and Uzziel. In that first moment he begins to present the personality of Michael and the context in which his story unfolds, God, soon after the creation on the seventh day - where the Bible refers to the time of your rest Livro de Gêneses, Bíblia Sagrada \\\\- enters a sleep deeper and you awake, supposedly the day of Judgement. Mankind then falls under the \\"guide\\" of the Archangels and their subordinates, the angels. There are five Archangels: Michael, the prince of the angels, heir to that title by being the firstborn. Uziel, commander of the armies of cherubim. Rafael, who was exiled after the fight of his brothers archangels. Gabriel, Master of Fire, rebelled against Archangel Michael. And, Lucifer, the morning star. As might be expected, Lucifer naturally craved the throne of his brother and it is around that nebulous plot that the course of the story takes place, as the rivalry between the two brothers is the main character of the book. The former general of the cherubim, Ablon, comes to us in Rio de Janeiro, in the near future, in the \\"hands of the Creator\\",A batalha do Apocalipse, Spohr, E., 2010 i.e., standing in the hands of Christ the Redeemer. He meets his friend Orion, former King of Atlantis and current servant of Lucifer, who comes to propose a truce. Ablon's rival Apollyon is a deadly protagonist.  Characters  * Archangel Michael: The Prince of angels, and the most radical of them. Later the leader of the archangels. He defeated the armies of Lucifer and drove them to Sheol. * Ablon, the Renegade Angel or also called First General: The protagonist of the book. Over the years on earth, Ablon traveled through diverse corners of the world, always escaping from various dangers. At the present moment of the book, Ablon is in Brazil, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, and becomes the leader of a great gathering of angels. * Lucifer, the Morning Star or the Son of the Dawn: After revolting against his brother Michael, today he has his own kingdom in the depths of Hell. * Archangel Gabriel, The Master of the Fire or Messenger: He came too close to human beings, and therefore he adhered to their cause. Like Lucifer, he also revolted against Michael, but for less selfish motives. * Archangel Raphael, the Cure of God: Being the kindest of the archangels, in the time of the deluge, he disappeared from paradise, causing everyone to believe that he had descended to the earth to live as a mortal. * Archangel Uziel, the Golden Marshal: The youngest among the archangels. Commander of the order of the cherubim (the soldiers of God). * Apollyon, the Destroying Angel: Lucifer's favourite warrior. When he fell with him, he became one of the nine Dukes of Hell. * Shamira, the Witch of En-Dor: Having been trained early in the arts of magic and necromancy, Shamira met Ablon when he saved her from her persecutors in Babylon. Since then, both have been helping each other as they can each time they meet. * Amael, the Lord of the Volcanoes: After helping the Archangel Michael to create the biblical flood, he repented and ended up following Lucifer and falling in Sheol. To this day he cries fervent tears for the atrocities he committed. * Flower-of- the-East: Daughter of Chinese nobles. Her tongue was cut off and she was sold after a revolution. She is a great help to the Witch of En-Dor in saving the Ablon from death.  Important Places  Heavenly Palace: the stronghold of the archangels in the Fifth Heaven, the most central and important point of the heavenly paradise. Fortress of Zion: the greatest bastion of the forces of the archangel Michael out of the sky. Located in the ethereal plane, under the worldly city of Jerusalem. Citadel of Fire: the First region of Heaven which is the meeting point of ishins. It was ruled by Amael, then by Aziel, and later became the headquarters of Gabriel and the new rebels. Tsafon, Mount of the Congregation: the highest region of the Seventh Heaven where God was asleep. Sheol: the dimension where the remains of Tehom and the gods of darkness were buried. It later served as home to Lucifer and his fallen angels, becoming known as Hell. Castle of Light: the main stronghold of the cherubim, located in the Fourth Heaven.  Summary  In Aurora the ages there has always been good and evil, which was destroyed by God along with their archangels created for the purpose of governing and protecting the earth. Long before the creation of man, God created the Archangels and soon the angels to serve and protect his creation. 7 days say they are very well explained in this book where each day was summed up in a million years, which led to the creation of the world we live in today. At the end of the sixth day, God was tired, and \\"fell asleep\\" at Mount Tsafon and let the angels and archangels to take care of all his creation, especially man, created in his image and likeness. After the creation of men, still live on the seventh day, which God is asleep and we are governed by angels. In the glory days, the Archangel Michael, the first created by God, the eldest son, he felt diminished, and blinded by envy and jealousy by humans, ordered mass destruction, but was barred by the legion of warriors, 18 renegade angels, led by Ablon, hero of this book. These angels were sentenced to 18 Haled (earth) and trapped in their avatars and forever pursued by warriors Miguel, until they are killed because they were considered traitors of heaven and condemned to live humans stuck together that both defended until the end of time, the end of the seventh day, the Day of Reckoning where God and awaken your universe exilaria those who were against their will. Lucifer also made a revolution, claiming to defend human but it was just jealousy for his brother what motivated him, making him take Sheol (hell) and third heaven, where there was created the refuge of evil, for which all unjust and malicious would be sent. And so begins the era of a hero, the protagonist of this book that involves romance, mystery, action, fiction and mysteries never before revealed. Ablon goes through various adventures, hovering past and present in which is supported by the witch of Endor (Shamira) which saved him from the hands of the tyrant king of Babylon, destroyed himself. Remembering here that even before Lucifer was exiled renegade angels existed, which is different from Lucifer, the fallen angel. After various adventures experienced by Ablon, finally comes the time of the Day of Reckoning, the famous Battle of Armageddon which will decide the future of humanity, the planet and all the beings that inhabit it. It is the legendary battle between the defender of humanity and the Archangel Michael, overcome by jealousy and greed, which led to him being the most tyrannical of all the universe, trying to match up to God who in his sick mind believed was his destiny.http://mundodoslivros8.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-batalha-do- apocalipse.html Ablon, when he discovers that Ishatar (his partner renegade) was murdered by Black Angel, gets mad and blind with rage, but she was dead on behalf of a secret that would change the entire fate of the universe, a secret which Ablon only discover at the last breath of his life. The book of Revelation Battle involves mysteries never revealed. It's like reading the Apocalypse, but in an innovative language and full of answers.  Reviews  \\"There is nothing in known Portuguese literature that resembles the Battle of the Apocalypse.\\" - José Louzeiro, writer and screenwriter  Movie  Several book fans believed that the work would receive an adjustment to the theaters because of its great success in Brazil and abroad. However, no company decided to acquire their rights, and work only followed in bookstores.

He served as Minister for Defence in the Nkrumah government during the First Republic of Ghana until it was overthrown in 1966. He was also as Minister for various other Ministries throughout the reign of the Convention People's Party. Early life and education Kofi Baako's father was a teacher. He made Kofi Baako start school when he was only three years old. On completion of his elementary school education at the Roman Catholic School in his native Saltpond, he continued with his secondary school education at St. Augustine's College, Cape Coast. Work and politics Baako became a teacher and later a civil servant. He was inspired by the speeches of Kwame Nkrumah advocating for independence for Ghana. This inspired him to write an article, \\"My Hatred of Imperialism\\" which resulted in him being fired from his job. He later met Nkrumah who made him editor-in-chief of the Cape Coast Daily Mail when he was still only twenty years old. Another article he subsequently wrote while with the Daily Mail was \\"We Call for Freedom.\\" This got him imprisoned by the colonial government. Nkrumah and some other leaders of the Convention People's Party were jailed with him. Later when Nkrumah eventually won elections and formed a government, some of these men who were in prison with him became ministers in Nkrumah's government. Kofi Baako was elected as Member of Parliament for Saltpond in the Central Region of Ghana. He was appointed a Minister of State by Kwame Nkrumah in his colonial government prior to independence. He continued in various capacities throughout the duration of the Nkrumah government. In the earlier years of the government, he was initially a Minister without portfolio prior to being appointed Minister for Information and Broadcasting in August 1957, making him the youngest minister not only in Ghana but in the whole of the British Commonwealth of Nations. He was appointed into office when he was only 29 years old. Baako served as Minister for Defence between September 1961 and 24 February 1966.

Lerner became director of the Exempt Organizations Unit of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 2005, and subsequently became the central figure in the 2013 IRS targeting controversy in the targeting of conservative groups, either denying them tax-exempt status outright or delaying that status until they could no longer take effective part in the 2012 election. On May 10, 2013, in a conference call with reporters, Lerner apologized that Tea Party groups and other groups had been targeted for audits of their applications for tax-exemption.[13][14][15] Both conservative and liberal groups were scrutinized. Only three groups - all branches of the Democratic group Emerge America - had tax exemptions revoked. Lerner resigned over the controversy. An investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation, completed in 2015, found \\"substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment and institutional inertia\\" but \\"found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution.\\" Early life and education Lerner graduated from Northeastern University.Caitlin Dickson, IRS Scandal's Central Figure, Lois Lerner, Described as 'Apolitical', Daily Beast (May 14, 2013). She earned her J.D. from the Western New England College of Law. Career before the IRS After graduating from law school, Lerner became a staff attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice Criminal Division. Lerner then joined the Federal Election Commission's (FEC) general counsel's office as an assistant general counsel in 1981. She spent twenty years at the FEC, being appointed Associate General Counsel for Enforcement (the head of the FEC's Enforcement Division) in 1986. Lerner was acting general counsel for the FEC for the first six months of 2001. Internal Revenue Service career Lerner joined Internal Revenue Service in 2001, as Director of Rulings and Agreements in the Exempt Organizations function of TEGE. In January 2006, she was appointed Director Exempt Organizations. In that capacity, Lerner led an organization of 900 IRS tax law enforcement officials responsible for a broad range of compliance activities, including examining the operational and financial activities of exempt organizations, processing applications for tax exemption, providing direction through private letter rulings and technical guidance, and providing customer education and outreach to the exempt community.  2013 IRS Scandal  On May 10, 2013, in advance of a public release of the audit findings, Lerner answered a planted question at a meeting of the American Bar Association (ABA) by stating that the IRS was \\"apologetic\\" for what she termed \\"absolutely inappropriate\\" actions. Lerner said that the extra scrutiny had not been centrally planned and had been done by low-level \\"front-line people\\" in the Cincinnati office.Frank James, Lois Lerner's Brief and Awful Day on Capitol Hill, NPR (May 22, 2013). The Washington Post subsequently reported that documents showed that \\"IRS officials at the agency's Washington headquarters sent queries to conservative groups asking about their donors and other aspects of their operations, while officials in the El Monte and Laguna Niguel offices in California sent similar questionnaires to tea-party- affiliated groups.\\" Lerner's superior, then-acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller, later testified to Congress that he had discussed with Lerner how she was to make the revelation and apology using a planted question at the ABA meeting, rather than at her appearance two days earlier before the House Ways and Means Committee. On May 10, 2013, in a conference call with reporters, Lerner apologized that Tea Party groups and other groups had been targeted for audits of their applications for tax-exemption.Zachary A.

Retrieved 2015-10-26 Lerner told those on the conference call that, in an attempt to manage the large number of tax-exemption applications between 2010 and 2012, the agency had identified some applicants using \\"shortcuts\\" such as targeting those applications containing terms like \\"Tea Party\\" or \\"patriots\\" in their titles. Lerner said, however, that such actions were not driven by any political agenda, but added, \\"We made some mistakes. Some people didn't use good judgment.... For that we're apologetic.\\" Lerner also said that only about 25 percent of the flagged applications were Tea Party related, but admitted that any singling out of the groups was \\"absolutely inappropriate and not the way we should do things.\\" Administrative leave and resignation On May 23, 2013, the IRS placed Lerner on paid administrative leave. As her interim replacement, Acting IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel named Ken Corbin, previously Deputy Director of the Submission Processing, Wage, and Investment Division, as acting director of the Exempt Organizations Division. Later, while still on administrative leave, Lerner formally resigned, and retired from the IRS, effective September 23, 2013. 2014 Contempt of Congress citation In May 2014, Lerner was declared in contempt of Congress in connection with her invocation of her Fifth Amendment not to testify on the matter before a congressional committee. The contempt resolution, H.Res. 574, was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on May 7, 2014 by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. On May 7, 2014, the resolution passed on a 231–187 vote, with all Republicans and six Democrats voting in favor, and every other Democrat opposed.H.Res. 574. Representative Steve Stockman introduced a measure (never taken up by the House) that, had it been adopted, would have directed Speaker John Boehner to instruct the House sergeant at arms to arrest Lerner for contempt of Congress. In a seven-page letter to Speaker Boehner dated March 31, 2015, United States Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen said that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal contempt charges against Lerner.Krishnadev Calamur, Justice Department Won't Charge IRS' Lois Lerner With Criminal Contempt, NPR (April 1, 2015). Machen disagreed with Issa's assertion that Lerner had waived her constitutional right against self-incrimination by making an opening statement at a May 2013 hearing in which she made a brief opening remark proclaiming her innocence, before invoking her Fifth Amendment privilege. In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office wrote: \\"Ms. Lerner did not waive her Fifth Amendment privilege by making general claims of innocence. The Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense if she were prosecuted for contempt.\\" Congressional subpoenaing of Lerner's email messages In 2014, the House Oversight Committee under Issa issued subpoenas for all of Lerner's email messages.Kennifer Bendery, Darrell Issa Demands Emails From Lois Lerner From Before Email Really Existed, Huffington Post (June 25, 2014). One subpoena directed FEC chairman Lee E. Goodman to turn over all emails sent to or from Lerner, or copied to Lerner, from the past 28 years, stretching back to January 1, 1986, a time before commercialized email existed.Elias Isquith, Darrell Issa wants to see every Lois Lerner email since 1986, Salon (June 26, 2014). The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed the IRS for all e-mails to and from Lerner and various other employees, such as Lerner subordinate Holly Paz, General Counsel William Wilkins and chief of staff Jonathan Davis.Gregory Korte, Turning over Lerner e-mails could take years, IRS says, USA Today (March 26, 2014). At a hearing in March 2014, IRS commissioner John Koskinen said that the IRS had by that time provided 690,000 pages of documents to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and 420,000 of redacted documents to the House and Senate oversight committees. Koskinen said that the IRS had spent 10 months and $15 million complying with various investigations to date, and that it could take months or years to comply with broader subpoenas. In 2014, in further pursuit of the House of Representatives Congressional inquiry, the House Oversight Committee, chaired by Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), issued a subpoena for all of Lerner's email messages during the time in question. Months later, the IRS informed Congress that they did not have all of her email messages, due to her hard drive crashing, causing them to be irretrievably lost, that the IRS had taken steps to recover the email messages, but that it was impossible. The IRS Inspector General's office said, however, that they found back-up computer tapes, and would attempt to reconstitute the emails from the back-up tapes. Committee Investigators, however, said that when they later went to obtain the backup tapes from the IRS, the IRS employees in the back-up tape unit said that no one from IRS headquarters had ever asked for them.Dinan, Stephen. \\"IRS erased Lois Lerner's emails even after subpoena, audit says; Up to 24,000 emails completely lost\\", The Washington Times, June 25, 2015 Retrieved 2015-06-29 Hard drive crash and back-up tape erasure of Lerner's emails Testifying in June 2015, the IRS Deputy Inspector General Timothy P. Camus said that 424 back-up tapes, most likely to have contained the missing emails, were erased in March 2014—a month after the IRS said it realized it was missing some of Lerner's emails because of a hard-drive crash, and although the emails were then under subpoena from the Oversight Committee. He stated, however, that their investigation \\"did not uncover evidence that the erasure was done ... to destroy evidence or conceal information from Congress,\\" and noted that there was a \\"remote possibility\\" that additional emails might still be found. He said that officials were examining the possibility, however, of criminal activity. Testifying in June 2015, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration Russell George and his deputy, Timothy Camus, told the Oversight Committee an investigation by them had been able to recover more than 1,000 emails that the IRS did not turn over to Congress. Their investigation could not determine why Lerner's computer crashed, but that, \\"Prior to our investigation, and our efforts to recover Ms. Lerner's missing e-mails, the IRS did not search for, review or examine the two separate sources of backup tapes, the server hard drives, or the loaner laptops that ultimately produced new, previously undisclosed e-mails.\\"Frates, Chris. \\"IRS watchdog: Up to 24,000 missing Lois Lerner emails\\", CNN, June 25. 2015. Retrieved 2015-06-29 In a statement released June 25, 2015, the IRS said it has \\"fully cooperated with the investigation,\\" but acknowledged the backup tapes should not have been erased. \\"The IRS recognizes there was a clear breakdown of communication in one part of the organization regarding the need to preserve and retain the back-up tapes and information,\\" the statement said, noting that an internal review found the erasure wasn't intentional. Email account under the name \\"Toby Miles\\" On August 23, 2015, the IRS told a federal court that Lerner had a second personal email account that she used to conduct IRS business. The account was set up under the name \\"Toby Miles.\\" The disclosure occurred in a lawsuit by the Judicial Watch, which is suing to obtain the release of Lerner's emails. According to Eliana Johnson of National Review, a former colleague said that Toby Miles was the name of Lerner's dog. FBI finds no evidence to support criminal prosecution The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI began an investigation into the IRS controversy in May 2013.Hannah Hess, DOJ Clears Lois Lerner, Closes IRS Investigation, Roll Call (October 23, 2015). In October 2015, the DOJ announced it was closing the investigation and would not seek criminal charges.Timothy M. Phelps, Justice Dept. won't file criminal charges over allegations of IRS targeting conservative groups, Los Angeles Times (October 23, 2015). The determination came after an investigation of almost two years, in which the DOJ and FBI interviewed more than 100 witnesses and reviewed more than a million pages of IRS documents. In a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, announcing the case closure, Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs Peter J. Kadzik wrote that while \\"our investigation uncovered substantial evidence of mismanagement, poor judgment, and institutional inertia...Not a single IRS employee reported any allegation, concern or suspicion that the handling of tax-exempt applications--or any other IRS function--was motivated by political bias, discriminatory intent, or corruption.\\" Kadzik wrote \\"We found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution.\\"Leada Gore. \\"Lois Lerner, Internal Revenue Service cleared by Justice Department, no charges will be filed\\", AL.com (October 23, 2015).

Reactions to the investigation's conclusions were split along partisan lines. Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said that decision not to prosecute ignored \\"volumes of evidence in the public record and efforts to obstruct legitimate inquires\\", and that \\"giving Lois Lerner a free pass only reinforces the idea that government officials are above the law and that there is no consequence for wrongdoing.\\" Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, the ranking member of the Oversight Committee, said that \\"Over the past five years, Republicans in the House of Representatives have squandered literally tens of millions of dollars going down all kinds of investigative rabbit holes—IRS, Planned Parenthood, Benghazi—with absolutely no evidence of illegal activity. I believe the American people have higher expectations for their elected officials, and they want Congress to start doing its job and focusing on issues that matter instead of these ridiculous, partisan, taxpayer-funded attacks.\\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Goodlatte, the recipient of the DOJ letter, said that DOJ's decision was \\"disturbing.

In certain chi- square tests, one rejects a null hypothesis about a population distribution if a specified test statistic is too large, when that statistic would have approximately a chi-square distribution if the null hypothesis is true. In minimum chi-square estimation, one finds the values of parameters that make that test statistic as small as possible. Among the consequences of its use is that the test statistic actually does have approximately a chi-square distribution when the sample size is large. Generally, one reduces by 1 the number of degrees of freedom for each parameter estimated by this method.  Illustration via an example  Suppose a certain random variable takes values in the set of non-negative integers 1, 2, 3, . . . . A simple random sample of size 20 is taken, yielding the following data set. It is desired to test the null hypothesis that the population from which this sample was taken follows a Poisson distribution. : \\\\begin{array}{cc} \\\\text{value} & \\\\text{frequency} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 7 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 8 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ >8 & 0 \\\\end{array} The maximum likelihood estimate of the population average is 3.3. One could apply Pearson's chi-square test of whether the population distribution is a Poisson distribution with expected value 3.3. However, the null hypothesis did not specify that it was that particular Poisson distribution, but only that it is some Poisson distribution, and the number 3.3 came from the data, not from the null hypothesis. A rule of thumb says that when a parameter is estimated, one reduces the number of degrees of freedom by 1, in this case from 9 (since there are 10 cells) to 8\\\\. One might hope that the resulting test statistic would have approximately a chi-square distribution when the null hypothesis is true. However, that is not in general the case when maximum-likelihood estimation is used. It is however true asymptotically when minimum chi-square estimation is used.  Finding the minimum chi-square estimate  The minimum chi-square estimate of the population mean λ is the number that minimizes the chi-square statistic : \\\\sum \\\\frac{(\\\\text{observed}-\\\\text{expected})^2}{\\\\text{expected}} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^8 \\\\frac{\\\\left((\\\\text{count in cell }k)- 20\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^ke^{-\\\\lambda}}{k!}\\\\right)\\\\right)^2}{20\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^ke^{-\\\\lambda}}{k!}\\\\right)} + \\\\frac{(0-a)^2}{a} where a is the estimated expected number in the \\"> 8\\" cell, and \\"20\\" appears because it is the sample size. The value of a is 20 times the probability that a Poisson-distributed random variable exceeds 8, and it is easily calculated as 1 minus the sum of the probabilities corresponding to 0 through 8\\\\. By trivial algebra, the last term reduces simply to a. Numerical computation shows that the value of λ that minimizes the chi-square statistic is about 3.5242. That is the minimum chi-square estimate of λ. For that value of λ, the chi-square statistic is about 3.062764. There are 10 cells. If the null hypothesis had specified a single distribution, rather than requiring λ to be estimated, then the null distribution of the test statistic would be a chi-square distribution with 10 − 1 = 9 degrees of freedom. Since λ had to be estimated, one additional degree of freedom is lost. The expected value of a chi-square random variable with 8 degrees of freedom is 8. Thus the observed value, 3.062764, is quite modest, and the null hypothesis is not rejected.

Brazos County Early Marriages: William Mayfield to Mary Ann Curd, 16 Mar 1848 California In 1849, William and his family were headed to California with a U. S. Army wagon train but were sent back to avoid the danger to civilians from the Lipan Apache on the trail and they then took a six-month trip by ship from Galveston around Cape Horn to reach California. After they landed at San Francisco,Mayfield, Indian summer, pp.26-27 William took his family to the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley, then Mariposa County, now Tulare County to a place at the confluence of Sycamore Creek with the Kings River, (about 1.5 miles above modern Trimmer, California). There he and his sons built a cabin, put in crops and began mining.Mayfield, Indian summer, pp.26-42 Thomas Jefferson does not mention a sister but a Miran (Mary Ann) Mayfield, age 3 born in Texas, appears on the California 1850 mortality schedule which means she died between June 1849 and June 1850 and in the 1850 census in Mariposa County there are no other Mayfields there.http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/MAYFIELD/2000-07/0963982548 Date: Thu, 20 Aug 1998 16:05:31 -0700, From: Hoyle Mayfield The Nov. 13, 1850 census, shows Mayfield 40 with $10,000 in property and his son John 20 as miners. His son Ben 16 is listed separately with Mary 20 and her child S [or T] Willson Mayfield 7, presumably at the cabin. 1850 Census, Mariposa County, CA, p. 49 Nov. 13, 1850 Mayfield and his son John may have taken livestock to Stockton, California at the end of the year because they are also listed as farmers in the 1850 census in San Joaquin County on Nov. 24, 1850. 1850 Census, San Joaquin County, CA, p. 539 Nov. 24, 1850 The whole family (William, Mary, John, Benjamin, and Thomas Wm.) appears once again in the 1850 census in San Joaquin County, on Dec. 3, 1850. Mary died in 1850, apparently in December after that census record was made.Marshall, Elmer Grady, The History of Brazos County, Texas, University of Texas, Austin, 1937. On the Curd family, it says that Mary Ann married William Mayfield and died about 1850.] In 1851, William left Thomas [8] to be raised by the Choinumni, the friendly Yokut tribe living across the river from his cabin, while he and his two older sons left to engage in mining and raising cattle for the next 10 years.Thomas Jefferson Mayfield, in his story to Latta, called his stepmother Mary Ann Curd, mother, never mentioning his birth mother, suggesting Terissa died so early in his life that he had no memory of her. It also suggests Mary cared for him from the earliest years of his life, before her marriage to William, perhaps when she was as young as 13 years old, if Terissa died in or soon after child birth. Also Miran (Mary Ann) Mayfield, age 3 born in Texas, Thomas' sister, (who he strangely never mentioned) appears on the California 1850 mortality schedule which means she died between June 1849 and June 1850. This would mean she was conceived close to between September 1845 or as early as September 1846, 2 to 3 years before the marriage between Mary Ann Curd with William when she was 15 or 16 years old. Coupled with Williams odd abandonment of Thomas to the care of the local tribe of Yokuts for years with few visits, suggests his father may have blamed Thomas for his first wife's death, and could not bear to have him near him after his second wife died and was no longer there to care for him. While his son Thomas Jefferson was living among the Choinumni, William Mayfield helped do the first survey of Tulare County, placed the first hogs around Tulare Lake. With his older sons he ran cattle and horses through most of the San Joaquin Valley, captured wild horses on the west side of that valley and fought Monache on the east side becoming well known throughout the valley.[Mayfield, Indian summer, p.22] Owens Valley Indian War In 1861, cattle were being driven over the Sierras to feed the mining boon town of Aurora. Some cattlemen had begun ranching nearby in the Owens Valley. The consequences of the disastrous winter caused by the Great Flood of 1862 and the encroachment of the cattle on the food supply of the Paiute led to the threat of starvation for the Owens Valley Paiute who were forced to take cattle to feed themselves. This led to a conflict with these ranchers that broke into open warfare, known as the Owens Valley Indian War. The settlers sent word to the county seat at Visalia for help and William Mayfield led a band of Tulare County militiamen to the aid of the settlers there. After joining forces with a detachment of militia from Aurora, he marched north with his command of 60 men and engaged the Paiute in the Battle of Bishop Creek where his force was driven back and had to hold out in a ditch until nightfall when they were able to withdraw and turned back down the valley. The next day they encountered the California Volunteer force under George S. Evans and Mayfield and 40 of his men, joined him. As Evans' and Mayfield's force marched north, Evans' scouts reported that Lieutenant Noble with fifty men of Company A, 2nd Cavalry, from Fort Churchill on their way south to Putnam's Store were nearby. Colonel Evans halted until Lieutenant Noble's command could come up with them and then proceeded to the north. Scouts were sent out and one scout returned reporting a large force of Indians 12 miles (19 km) away near Bishop Creek. Evans moved up in a snow storm, but the Indians had left at the approach of the main body of cavalry. Campfires were observed in a canyon to the north. April 9, 1862, the following day Evans advanced to the canyon now known as Mayfield Canyon and engaged the Paiute who were above them in the canyon. Mayfield and four of his men advanced with the Volunteers and he was wounded in the firefight. While being carried back under fire he was killed. Mayfield Canyon was later named in his honor.

M. Resnick, \\"Odo of Cambrai and the Investiture Crisis in the Early Twelfth Century\\", Viator 28 (1997), 85–87. Hugh's family was of seigneurial rank, originating in Oisy and Inchy, and had provided most of the castellans of Cambrai during the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Before 1076, Hugh rebelled against the bishop Lietbert and was excommunicated. The bishop refused to lift the ban \\"unless [Hugh] first consents to renounce with his own hands—werpire, to use the common expression—every fief which he holds in the city of Cambrai.\\"F. L.

Grierson (New York: Harper Torchbook, 1961), 128: nisi prius dimissionem manu propria, quod et vulgo werpire dicitur, faceret ex omni beneficio quod infra ambitum Cameracae civitatis habebat. The source is the Gesta Lietberti episcopi Cameracensis (\\"The Deeds of Bishop Lietbert of Cambrai\\"), written within a quarter-century of the bishop's death. The ceremony of werpitio (in French déguerpissement) generally involved handing over a symbol of the fief to the one from whom it had been received. Hugh continued to encroach on the authority of the bishop within the city during the episcopate of Gerard II. Since both the French king, Philip I, and the dowager countess of Hainaut, Richilda, were opposed to increased imperial influence—represented by the bishop of Cambrai—in the county of Flanders, they supported Hugh in his rebellion. With the help of Richilda's rival, Count Robert I of Flanders, the bishop succeeded in exiling Hugh to England between about 1086 and 1090.

Gameplay Guardians can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters, while energy bars are displayed for special moves. The controls for Guardians consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player also can perform a jump attack. When two players play, they can perform team-based special moves. Enemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.

Social media features anything from content-sharing to collaboration, and can take the form of platforms such as micro-blogging, forums, bookmarking sites, social networks and wikis. Prominent examples of social media include websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and Reddit. Social media is not only used for personal uses but is now playing a growing role in business and organisations; with entrepreneurs increasingly looking towards social media platforms to market their businesses. It is evidently becoming the case that investment in social media “is a necessity, not a luxury”, it is a fundamental instrument which should be used in any marketing plan. However, it is clear that business owners encounter various challenges with respect to investing in social media; they may face lack of time and knowledge on how to determine the return on investment (ROI) as an example; this is a recognized measurement to evaluate the efficiency and financial consequences of an investment and to ultimately assess the profitability of a business.  Return on Investment (ROI)  ROI refers to the money that a business or a corporation earns as a percentage of the full value of their assets which have been invested. The method to calculate this is: Return on investment = (Income - Cost) / Cost. ROI is the most common profitability ratio that establishes the efficiency of an investment. In this context, ROI will measure the returns from a social media investment. However, it is commonly argued that calculating ROI is difficult and also depends on the applied returns and costs. There is no universal way of measuring the ROI of the social media commitments (Kelly, 2012). As such, some business owners tend to count how many Facebook fans and Twitter followers they have or how many retweets and likes they enjoy.https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinemoorman/2013/05/21/measuring- social-media-roi-companies-emphasize-voice-metrics/ However, this may not be an effective measure of ROI. We can measure ROI using metric tools that foster conversion measurement and optimized CPM, which enables Facebook ads to reach the target audience (Burg, 2013). This enables the investor to know who clicked through their ads thus enhancing future business planning. In addition, we can measure ROI by analyzing interactions, calculated by multiplying the number of received likes by the number of friends of those likes witnessed the action. This defines how far the advert went; moreover, we can analyze traffic to determine the ROI in social media efforts (Harden & Heyman, 2011). Indeed, different social media understand the business owners need to evaluate their ROI in social media and thus there is a provision for built-in analytics tools for following engagement, likes, and shares (Burg, 2013). This helps the marketers to determine how often people find the marketer's page through the social sites. For example, on Facebook, one can analyze the comment to like a ratio of posts while on Twitter, one can analyze the retweets to tweet ratio. Notably, the higher the ratios, the higher the ROI is.  Benefits of investing in social media   Building brand recognition and loyalty  Initially, business owners may choose to invest in social media as a means of building their brand recognition. Through social media, businesses can simultaneously draw in new consumers whilst making existing customers more familiar with the brand. For example, through the use of the micro-blogging site Twitter; brands can promote their products with a simple “tweet”, and any regular Twitter user could potentially stumble across their products and services via their newsfeed, whilst existing customers may become extra accustomed to the brand after seeing positive responses; following the current consumer's fashions. Companies can effectively use social media to enforce their company history, values and advantages in a way that will appeal to, and attract, many consumers. It is statistically proven that businesses who engage in social media experience higher brand loyalty from their customers, hence we’ve seen not only an increase in investments, but also in the ROI; with over “72% of marketers now using social media to develop loyal fans”, and of those who have been engaging in social media platforms for at least 1 year, “69% found it useful for building a loyal fan base”.  Social media campaigns drive sales  Social media can directly lead to an increase in sales and brand awareness, as demonstrated with multiple campaigns in the past. A notable example was the success of the Jimmy Choo (2010) ‘CatchAChoo’ campaign; with which the internationally acclaimed luxury shoe and accessories brand set out to generate substantial online exposure to promote their new trainer collection, engaging customers through a real-time treasure hunt around London to locate a pair of trainers using the ‘Foursquare’ network. This campaign lasted just under 3 weeks, with over 4000 individuals participating and 250 different blogs covering this campaign; with over 4000 mentions of this hunt on Twitter. The results? Trainer sales in Jimmy Choo stores rose by over 33% after coverage from The Evening Standard, furthermore the reputation of the brand; measured by positive mentions of the brand, went up by almost 40% as a result in less than a month. Similarly, online fashion store ASOS.com launched another Twitter campaign; using the '#BestNightEver' hashtag. ASOS achieved high levels of customer engagement, in turn driving more than £5m worth of sales and helping the brand register its highest ROI to date in the UK, not to mention the successes it brought in the US, with searches for the ASOS trademark soaring by over 50%.  Increased website traffic  Investing in a company's engagement in social media undoubtedly has its benefits. Activity on social networking platforms such as Facebook as an example can lead to increased traffic that the company's website receives via these referrals. A common way to measure website traffic can be done by comparing search engine rankings through SEO(Search Engine Optimization) – mentions, sharing and the traffic of websites are positive signals of popularity; stamping the authority of many brand's websites and allowing them to rank highly among their competitors. Activity on social media almost acts as a signal to search engines of a company's popularity and credibility, with all of this ultimately leads to more sales and increased brand awareness.  Controversies of Investing in Social Media   Facebook's Acquisition of WhatsApp  Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp, the popular mobile messaging app, has extreme significance in terms of social media investments. Although attracting much criticism for Facebook investing the highest sum of money for any IT company ever into an already five-year-old start-up; much profit is to be made with Facebook already raking-in 53% of their existing revenue from mobile-ad sales. However, not only will the WhatsApp staff benefit from this deal, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital are entitled to what is estimated to be over $3 billion from their investments in WhatsApp, with their initial funding figure believed to be approximately $60 million; Sequoia Capital are believed to own approximately 20% of WhatsApp - their investments have clearly paid off.  Risks  * Facebook are effectively paying $42 per user of WhatsApp, will this acquisition pay off? * Existing competition from other messaging apps can prove a threat to WhatsApp, for example WeChat which had a reported figure of 396 million monthly active users in June 2014; an increase of 40 million users since December 2013. The existing competition from these messaging services certainly has negative implications for WhatsApp's user base and revenue.  Rewards  * Allows access to China – China boasts over 1.2 billion mobile users, but that is normally not of any use as Facebook is of course blocked in China. However, that is not the case with WhatsApp, thus Facebook can certainly benefit from the lowering of this barrier. * Increased users - Facebook enjoys 1.23 billion monthly active users, of which 945 million of them regularly access Facebook from mobile devices. This, coupled with the fact that WhatsApp has over 450 million monthly users, certainly allows Facebook to grow its user base and in turn increase revenue.  Other Recent Investments   Twitter's $10 Million 'Laboratory for Social Machines' Investment  Micro-blogging powerhouse Twitter has recently invested $ 10 million in the “Laboratory of Social Machines” initiative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This 5 year commitment from Twitter focuses on the creation and development of new technologies; using data from Twitter's archives, improving analysis and the understanding of social patterns among multiple social media platforms and other web content. Pattern discovery will be utilized to decipher interactions and shared interests among users of social media, while new applications and platforms will be developed for both individuals and institutions to discuss and act on paramount societal issues According to CEO of Twitter, Dick Costolo: \\"With this investment, Twitter is seizing the opportunity to go deeper into research to understand the role Twitter and other platforms play in the way people communicate, the effect that rapid and fluid communication can have and apply those findings to complex societal issues\\".  Reddit's $50 Million Funding  The major open source, community based social network and news site Reddit, famously labelled as the “front page of the internet”, has secured $50 million of investments from multiple sources; from global venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horrowitz to an array of celebrities such as the renowned rapper Snoop Dogg. CEO of Reddit Yishan Wong, has stated that the funding will go towards expanding Reddit's moderately low staff numbers of only 60, as well as developing new tools for community management and moderation; 10% of Reddit's 2014 ad revenue will also go towards charity.

After winning at a 1996 contest, Jang's script Golden Garden (황금빛 정원) was produced as a Best Theater episode on MBC. Jang was hired by SBS to write his first miniseries in 2002, Affection starring Kim Ji-ho and Yoo Jun-sang. He and Affection co-writer Jung Kyung-soon married in 2005. He began to gain attention in the TV industry when he wrote the historical epic Dae Jo Yeong (2006-2007), which starred Choi Soo-jong as the titular founder of the state of Balhae. Jang received recognition as Best Writer at the KBS Drama Awards and the Korea PD Awards. After Dae Jo Yeong, he and wife Jung Kyung-soon became writing partners again, and they would become best known for their collaborations with director Yoo In-shik—the hit dramas Giant and History of a Salaryman. Giant (2010), starring Lee Beom-soo, Park Jin-hee, Joo Sang-wook, Hwang Jung-eum, Park Sang-min and Jeong Bo-seok, is a period drama about three siblings' quest for revenge during the economic boom of 1970-80s Korea, as their fates play out against a larger tide of power, money, politics, and the growth of a city. History of a Salaryman (2011-2012), starring Lee Beom-soo, Jung Ryeo-won, Jung Gyu-woon, Hong Soo-hyun, Lee Deok-hwa and Kim Seo-hyung, is a quirky comedy and murder mystery about an ordinary salaryman who finds himself involved with corporate spies and rival pharmaceutical companies, and also a parody of modern office politics using the historical events during China's Chu–Han Contention as satire. Jang, Jung, and Yoo also worked together on the less successful Incarnation of Money (2013), which starred Kang Ji- hwan, Hwang Jung-eum, Park Sang-min, Choi Yeo-jin, Oh Yoon-ah and Kim Soo-mi, and focused on the greed and corruption in Korean society involving prosecutors, lobbyists and loan sharks. The period drama Empress Ki, which aired from 2013 to 2014, starred Ha Ji-won in the title role as a Goryeo woman who becomes an empress of the Yuan Dynasty, depicting her loves and political ambitions as she is torn between the two countries.

One of the most prominent old buildings in the area's oldest settlement, it was once the home of a leading local resident, and it has been named a historic site because of its distinctive Neoclassical- influenced architecture. History Settled in 1801,Graham, A.A., ed. History of Fairfield and Perry Counties, Ohio: Their Past and Present. Chicago: Beers, 1883. the community of New Reading was platted in 1805, before any other community in Perry County; for much of its early history, it was better known as \\"Overmyertown\\" in honor of its founder, Peter Overmyer. When the county was established in 1817, New Reading contended for the title of county seat,Martzolff, Clement Luther. History of Perry County, Ohio. New Lexington: Ward and Weiland, 1902, 85. and although it failed to obtain this distinction, it remained prosperous throughout the nineteenth century. Into this flourishing community moved Randolph Mitchell two years after the failed bid for county seat. Having paid the then-huge sum of $100 to buy seven lots in the village, he commenced the construction of a grand house, which was finished in 1828.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1135-1136. Before long, Mitchell had gained high standing in the community; he was a prominent member of the village's Methodist church, and later generations remembered him as one of the leading merchants of old New Reading. Architecture Mitchell's house is a brick building with a foundation of sandstone, a slate roof, and miscellaneous elements of sandstone and other types of stone.. Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2013-05-21. Built with a floor plan in the shape of the letter \\"L\\", the house is entered primarily through a grand entrance in the center of its five-bay facade. This entrance is the exterior's most prominent component, due to its trabeated entrance with an archway, its eight-panelled surrounding windows and fanlight, and its Ionic columns on both sides of the doorway. Inside, the house is divided into rooms surrounding a single hallway, and the rooms feature neoclassical detailing. The plan and details of the house's interior and entrance combine to make it typical of the Adam style, while the exterior is clearly Federal in style. Preservation The Randolph Mitchell House occupies a prominent place in the extant early architecture of Perry County. Few period residences in the area can compare with its Federal and Adam styling, and few have experienced so few changes by the hand of man. In December 1978, the Mitchell House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its distinctive architecture and because of its place as the home of a prominent citizen. It is one of four National Register-listed properties in Reading Township, along with St. Joseph's Catholic Church near Somerset, the home of General Philip Sheridan's family in Somerset, and Somerset's public square.

Career  Noh Hee-kyung has become renowned in South Korea for her realistic, cerebral and in-depth portrayals of the lives and relationships of ordinary people.  Early works, motherhood as theme  Noh said she wrote The Most Beautiful Goodbye in the World (1996) two years after the death of her own mother, as a tribute to her. The drama is about a devoted mother in her sixties whose family has always taken her for granted. But when they learn she has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and doesn't have much time left to live, they all come together for the first time to give her the support they've always denied her. With heart-wrenching dialogue and meaty performances from Na Moon-hee and Joo Hyun, the TV series instantly brought fame to Noh. The story of a dying mother resonated with viewers and critics alike, winning the Grand Prize for TV (\\"Daesang\\") and Best TV Drama at the 1997 Baeksang Arts Awards. After a 1997 novelization, Noh adapted the drama into a stage play in 2010, which starred Jung Ae-ri and Song Ok-sook in the lead role. In 2011, director Min Kyu-dong made a film adaptation titled The Last Blossom. Noh continued writing television dramas. Lie (1998), which started the \\"mania drama\\" trend (Korean slang for low ratings but big cult following online), is about a couple played by Lee Sung-jae and Yoo Ho-jeong who are unable to have children, and Bae Jong-ok as the woman who comes between them. In Did We Really Love? (1999), Bae Yong-joon struggles between the choice of love or materialism, represented by Kim Hye-soo and Yoon Son-ha. Sad Temptation (1999) was the first to feature a gay couple on Korean TV, played by Kim Kap-soo and Joo Jin-mo. Foolish Love (2000), starring Lee Jae- ryong and Bae Jong-ok, competed in the same timeslot as massive hit Hur Jun, and thus became one of the lowest-rated Korean dramas in history, at around 1%. Solitude (2002) dealt with a single mother (Lee Mi-sook) who is pursued by a younger man (Ryoo Seung-bum) 15 years her junior. In More Beautiful Than a Flower (2004), Noh explored the many facets of family love when a mother (the \\"flower\\" of the title, played by Go Doo-shim) is diagnosed with dementia. The drama received several awards at the 2004 KBS Drama Awards, including Best Writer for Noh, and the Grand Prize (\\"Daesang\\") for Go. It also won Best TV Drama at the 2004 Baeksang Arts Awards.  Urban melodramas  Goodbye Solo (2006) is an urban melodrama with an ensemble of seven main characters of different generations and backgrounds: a bartender (Chun Jung-myung), an artist (Yoon So-yi), a gangster (Lee Jae-ryong), a restaurant owner (Kim Min- hee), a secretary (Kim Nam-gil), a divorcee (Bae Jong-ok), and a mute old lady (Na Moon-hee). All feeling alienated because of pain in their past, they gradually interact and form a \\"family\\" borne out of emotional connection and mutual understanding. Noh said that the story unfolds to one common theme: that everyone is beautiful just the way they are. Known for her distinctive and striking dialogue, Noh poured many of her personal stories into the show, including her own experience with her mother. The drama is also notable for reinventing the career of actress Kim Min-hee. Previously known as a bad actress, Kim was a big fan of Noh's, and she campaigned for a role, despite getting rejected by Noh five times. But on the sixth time, Noh saw the actress's determination and hidden potential that made her right for the character Mi-ri. Despite cries of miscasting from drama fans, Kim went through strict acting training and character analysis, showing vast improvement in her performance and making the first steps towards her eventual transformation into a real actress. Noh then wrote several short dramas. In the four-episode Miracle (2006), Jang Yong played a man who reassesses his life after learning that he's in the final stages of lung cancer. While in Several Questions That Make Us Happy (2007), three stories unfold in omnibus format over two episodes. She reunited with director Pyo Min-soo (they had previously worked together on Lie, Sad Temptation, Foolish Love and Solitude) in The World That They Live In (also known as Worlds Within, 2008), about the hectic lives of a drama production team. Hyun Bin and Song Hye-kyo played TV directors who rekindle their romantic relationship. According to Song, after she and Pyo wrapped her last drama Full House in 2004, they had promised to work together with Noh. Song said, \\"I was their fan and so I had no reason to say no. Noh's writing is so good, it makes playing my role a challenge. It is hard to pull off natural and realistic acting.\\" Noh, for her part, said she \\"relied a bit more on the actors and was able to express myself more freely.\\"  Essays  In 2008, Noh published a collection of essays titled Everyone Not in Love Now Are Guilty. It became a bestseller. The book was divided into four sections with varying themes, namely: \\"Life is too difficult to concentrate only on love\\"; \\"The thing that love demands first, before trust or tears\\"; \\"If I could hold all of life and people in my eyes\\"; \\"When they were lonely, what did we do?\\". The essays contained Noh's reflections on life and love, dramas and actresses she's worked with, and the topic of her mother, who has been the most important driving influence in Noh's life.  Revival of single-episode dramas  After the single-episode anthology series Drama City was cancelled in 2008, TV writers and directors clamored for its revival. And in 2010, the now-renamed Drama Special aired its first episode, Red Candy, which was written by Noh. It starred Lee Jae-ryong as a forty-something married man going through a midlife crisis, who falls for a younger woman (Park Si-yeon) he sees everyday on the subway always carrying a red lollipop. Park said of Noh, \\"I felt that I had to be in whatever she writes.\\"  Cable debut and ratings success  Noh then wrote Padam Padam, her first melodrama with fantasy elements. It was also her first to be aired on cable television, since Padam Padam was one of the inaugural dramas of jTBC in late 2011. Jung Woo- sung played the leading role of a man recently released from prison after serving a 16-year sentence for a crime he didn't commit. Noh said she had underestimated Jung as merely \\"a handsome actor who brightens your mood,\\" but changed her mind after meeting him in person, calling him a \\"genuine actor.\\" Deeply moved by Noh's previous drama More Beautiful than a Flower, Jung said he had \\"always wanted to be part of her work but have never had the chance to do so. This character fell into my lap one day, whether by coincidence or destiny.\\" Supporting actor Kim Bum said that after acting the range of emotions his character goes through, he cultivated a stronger respect and gratitude towards Noh. In 2013, Song Hye-kyo and Kim Bum again joined Noh's next drama, That Winter, the Wind Blows. Instead of an original script, Noh adapted the 2002 Japanese drama . Song starred opposite Jo In-sung, who played a gambler whose survival depends on pulling off the ultimate con ― pretending to be his deceased friend so that the friend's blind sister will hand over her inheritance to him. Unlike most of Noh's dramas, Winter received solid ratings and was number one in its timeslot for 8 straight weeks. But it also disappointed her longtime fans, who criticized the drama for not being realistic and overly focusing on \\"pretty\\" imagery. Noh worked with Jo In-sung again in 2014's It's Okay, That's Love, which also reunited her with Gong Hyo- jin, who had previously starred in Noh's Wonderful Days (2001). This was Noh's fourth collaboration with director Kim Kyu-tae, after Worlds Within, Padam Padam, and That Winter, the Wind Blows. Kim said he and Noh wanted to make a drama that challenged social prejudice against the mentally ill, through the love story of a schizophrenic mystery novelist and a sexually phobic psychiatrist. Noh wrote a letter to the cast and crew on their last read- through that said, \\"During the rehearsals, we cried and laughed. Because I felt a bit sad about the time left with the team, I forgot about the pain of creativity and wanted to write a couple more episodes.\\" Despite lackluster TV ratings, It's Okay, That's Love drew critical praise and ranked third on the Content Power Index (CPI monitors non-traditional variables such as number of mobile and Internet streaming viewers and online \\"buzz\\" in social media). It also kickstarted a micro-trend of Korean dramas with themes involving mental illness, such as Kill Me, Heal Me and Hyde, Jekyll, Me.  Other activities  Noh is close to Beobryun, a Buddhist monk well known for his involvement in humanitarian issues. They are both active in Join Together Society (JTS Korea), an international relief group which donates to third-world countries and North Korea.

The grape has a long history in the region, growing in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques since at least the late 18th century. Ampelographers believe that Arrouya noir has some genetic relationship with Camaraou noir, Fer and Petit Courbu though the exact nature of those relationships is not yet known. The variety also shares some similarities in morphology with Cabernet Franc and until the late 19th century was often confused for the Loire and Bordeaux wine grape, especially in the Basses-Pyrénées and Hautes-Pyrénées region.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 56-57 Allen Lane 2012 History and confusion with other grapes Arrouya noir is often confused with another red wine grape grown in the Southwest France, Fer (pictured). The name Arrouya is believed to come from the word which means \\"red\\" in the Béarnese dialect. The grape has been growing the Pyrénées- Atlantiques since at least the late 18th century where it was mentioned in 1783 document as being a late-ripening variety. Up until the late 19th century, plantings of Arrouya noir among vineyards in the foothills of the Pyrénées were misidentified as Cabernet Franc. Even today the grape is sometimes confused for Cabernet Franc or other red grape varieties of Southwest France including Fer and Manseng noir. Viticulture Among the viticultural hazards that Arrouya noir vines are susceptible too is downy mildew (pictured left). Arrouya noir is a late-ripening grape variety that can be very vigorous and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and late season green harvesting. It's late-ripening nature means that it can be very sensitive to the conditions of a vintage and may not reach full physiological ripeness every year. The vine tends to produce small, compact bunches that are vulnerable to infections by botrytis bunch rot. Other viticultural hazards that Arrouya noir is susceptible to include black rot and downy mildew. Wine regions While Arrouya noir is permitted to be planted throughout the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department, it is not widely grown and is mostly limited to the Jurançon region where it is often found in field blends along with Camaraou noir in older vineyards. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Arrouya noir tends to produce pale-colored red wines that have noticeable levels of acidity and astringency. Synonyms Over the years, Arrouya noir has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Arhuya, Aroyat, Arrouyat, Arroya, Arruya, Dourec noir (in Béarn), Eremachaoua (in Béarn), Erematxahua (in French Basque Country), Rouja and Vieux rouge.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Arrouya noir Accessed: May 21st, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Arrouya noir"},{"id":"39452786","text":"Carl-Johan Meyer (born April 1, 1994) is a Swedish ice hockey player.

For example, the theory implies that the Universe had fewer dimensions after the Big Bang when its energy was high. Then the number of dimensions may have increased as the system cooled and the Universe may gain more dimensions with time. There could have originally been only one spatial dimension, with two dimensions total — one time dimension and one space dimension. When there were only two dimensions, the Universe lacked gravitational degrees of freedom. The theory is also tied to smaller amount of dimensions in smaller systems with the universe expansion being a suggested motivating phenomenon for growth of the number of dimensions with time, suggesting a larger number of dimensions in systems on larger scale. In 2011, Dejan Stojkovic from the University at Buffalo and Jonas Mureika from the Loyola Marymount University described use of a Laser Interferometer Space Antenna system, intended to detect gravitational waves, to test the vanishing-dimension theory by detecting a maximum frequency after which gravitational waves can't be observed. The vanishing-dimensions theory is seen as an explanation to cosmological constant problem: a fifth dimension would answer the question of energy density required to maintain the constant.

Anonymity In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Otário said he cherishes his anonymity to protect his ability to speak freely and to allow viewers of all demographics to relate to him. In addition to the paper bag on his head, he wears a suit and white gloves to cover his race and age. His speech is distorted into a high-pitch, Mickey Mouse-like voice.

Bradesco said the video was offensive and won a case against Google Inc. on 2012 to remove it from its YouTube platform. Google hasn't yet removed the video and has appealed the case to a federal court in São Paulo. Correios The video with criticisms about Brazilian Post and Telegraph Corporation (also known as Correios) was banned in Brazilian YouTube through a court order (though it still remains available on YouTube in other countries). The video compares rates in Brazil with other countries and criticizes the state monopoly in the postage sector. By Correios' request, the Brazilian court ordered Google Inc to delete some parts of the video that shows the company's logo, which claimed \\"improper use of trademark\\". The decision was taken in November 2013, however, it was only effectively fulfilled in June 2014, coincidentally after the start of the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet.

The two-month strike was the first in the history of the fledgling commercial aviation industry and also the first significant action for the year-old Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) which represented the 23 striking pilots.Cohen, Isaac. “Political Climate and Two Airline Strikes: Century Air in 1932 and Continental Airlines in 1983-85”. Industrial and Labor Relations Review. Vol. 43, No. 2 (Jan., 1990). p.308 Political agitation in the form of congressional hearings and public condemnations eventually forced Cord to relent and sell Century Airlines on April 2 to the Aviation Corporation (AVCO), parent company of American Airways. The strike highlighted the problems facing the commercial aviation industry as it began to grow and diversify significantly for the first time. Meanwhile, the success of the ALPA in lobbying for political support established it as a significant power in organized labor.  Background   Aviation industry  In 1925 the Kelly Act was passed giving the postmaster general the authority to allocate air mail routes to potential bidders and thus, the floodgates were opened for investment in the new industry of commercial aviation.Aaron Brenner, Benjamin Day, Immanuel Ness. Encyclopedia of Strikes in America, p.578. The next few years were characterized by mergers and jockeying for position amongst the various new enterprises and by 1931 a core group of major airlines had emerged including names such as American Airways and United Airlines.Cohen, p.309 Resentment began to grow however amongst smaller companies looking to take advantage of the emerging market for passenger travel who saw the larger companies as receiving unfair advantages in terms of route allocations and subsidies. The McNary-Watres Act of 1930, with its provision to allow the postmaster general to extend contracts with existing carriers without considering competing bids, especially fueled such resentment. In response to an amendment to the bill which would limit this particular power, then postmaster general Walter Folger Brown, \\"was very much opposed to the measure and explained what in his opinion would happen should it become law. He declared that low bidders getting contracts would find that they could not operate and that successors to them would take over the business. These successors would then come to the department for relief.\\"“Air Mail in Few Hands”. New York Times, Apr 17, 1932. E.L. Cord was particularly determined to change the system, striving to demonstrate that he could offer the cheapest service, even going so far as to say that he could carry mail for 30 cents a mile, roughly half the standard for existing routes.Lyman, Lauren D. “Result of Petition for Certificate of Convenience in Arizona by Independent Line Is Held Important to Operators Everywhere”. New York Times. Feb 14, 1932. Cord’s primary idea for how this could be done was through slashing overheads, particularly wages. Stinson SM-6000, the model of plane operated by Century Air Lines. Both the Stinson Aircraft Company and Lycoming Engines, the manufacturer of the plane's engines, were owned by E.L. Cord.  Pilots  With the technology of aviation still in its infancy, the pilot’s profession remained a fairly treacherous one. Pressure to fly from Post Office administrators in treacherous weather conditions especially caused many fatal accidents. In 1919, the first demonstration of organized action by pilots took place when a threat of strike action was made after two pilots were fired by assistant postmaster general Otto Praeger for refusing to fly in heavy fog. One of the two pilots was eventually reinstated and post office administrators agreed to more stringent safety standards regarding foul weather flying.Brenner, Day, Ness. P. 308 In May 1931, the Air Line Pilots Association was founded by David L. Behncke and it quickly became the largest union for pilots in the country including three quarters of the schedule line pilots in the country by the next year.Northrup, Herbert R. “Collective Bargaining by Air Line Pilots”. The Quarterly Journal of Economics , Vol. 61, No. 4 (Aug., 1947), p. 534. The decision was precipitated by changing pay conditions which were increasingly reducing the earnings of pilots during the early years of the depression. Meanwhile, technology improvements in aviation were changing the perception of flying. New features such as “robot pilots” which could control the planes through gyroscopes were making the task of piloting seem easier and easier.Lyman, Lauren D. “Planes in New Service Will Use Robot Pilots”. New York Times. Dec 7, 1930. Cord in particular made it known that he did not regard piloting as an especially skillful endeavor and subsequently saw no justification for paying pilots high wages.Cohen. p.313.  Strike timeline  On January 23, the management of Century announced a new wage scale for pilots which effectively resulted in a 40% cut, to be effective from February 1.Cohen, p.314 After initially agreeing to defer the decision by ten days in order to give the pilots and the ALPA a chance for arbitration, Cord decided on the 9th to refuse any further negotiations and immediately put into action the new wage scale. When the pilots arrived to work that morning they were met by armed guards and were ordered to resign in order to reapply to work under the new pay scale.Lyman, Lauren D. “Pilot’s Pay Involved in Air Mail Problem”. New York Times. Mar 6, 1932“Air Line Ousts Its 23 Pilots in Pay Clash”. New York Times. Feb 10, 1932. The pilots rejected this request and instead marched to the Chicago ALPA headquarters.  Recruiting replacements  Cord immediately set to work recruiting replacement pilots. By February 4, Century officials had announced that they had nearly reached the required quota for their schedules saying they had “far more applicants for the vacated positions than they could use”.“Century Airlines Filling Fliers’ Posts”. New York Times. Feb 15, 1932. Most of the scheduled routes suffered only slight disruption as a result. Indeed, replacements would not have been difficult to come by. Contemporary estimates at the number of qualified commercial pilots came to around 4000 with only a total of about 700 planes in service.“Cord is in Charge”. Los Angeles Times. Feb 16, 1932.Another estimate from Lyman puts the figure closer to 7000 qualified pilots. “More Pilots Than Planes”. New York Times. Feb 11, 1934.  Crash in St. Louis  On March 8, two Century pilots were fatally injured in a crash where replacement recruits were practicing night landings in anticipation of a resumption of full night flight services. The two dead were John F. Kirk of Chicago and Lloyd H. Atkinson who had been a test pilot in Los Angeles before moving to Chicago to find work. The crash occurred while on final approach into Curtiss-Steinberg Airport at about 1.50am when pilot Theodore Graff struck a windmill short of the runway.“Night Landing Tests Fatal For Two Pilots”. Los Angeles Times. Mar 9, 1932;“Two Die in Crash of Century Plane”. New York Times. Mar 9, 1932; New York Representative, Fiorello La Guardia. La Guardia had been a pilot in World War I, commanding of a unit of Ca.44 bombers.  ALPA political campaign  The ALPA were able to call on sympathetic ears for their cause from within influential political circles, both national and local. Representative Fiorello La Guardia of New York first raised the issue in Congress on February 18 when he condemned Cord and his practices and furthermore spoke about the need for Department of Commerce inspectors to keep and publish records of the replacement pilots, “because you can readily see the danger of putting inexperienced men in charge of passenger planes, not alone for the passengers but for the people on the ground below.”Congressional Record. 1932:4260. Several more congressmen vocalized their displeasure with Cord’s conduct including Representative William Larson from Georgia as well as Melvin Maas of Minnesota who asked the Secretaries of War and Navy to discourage military pilots on leave from flying Century planes, while two more representatives contacted the Mayor of Chicago to ask him to investigate the business affairs of Cord in Chicago.Cohen, 316. Hearings in the United States House of Representatives heard testimony from ALPA president David Behncke and from Dean Bourford, one of the striking Century Air Lines pilots.“Air Mail Monopoly Pictured By Maas”. New York Times. Mar 4, 1932 The whole affair had left Cord in an even weaker position with regard to bidding for routes, with postmaster general Brown expressing his allegiance to the striking pilots.  Century Air Lines sold  Under the weight of the political pressure from both national and local government, Cord was first forced to reduce flight services before he relented on April 2, selling Century Airlines to AVCO, in turn ending the strike. In exchange, Cord received 140,000 shares in the Aviation Corporation and also a directorship in the company. Neither the striking pilots, nor the replacements were to be brought over in the merger.“Century Airlines Sold In Merger”. New York Times. Apr 3, 1932.  Aftermath  The strike gave the ALPA the opportunity to assert itself as a power for organized pilots in America as it launched campaigns against the strikebreakers. The “Century Airlines Scab List” was printed on the front page of the first issue of the union's journal, Air Line Pilot, in April. David Behncke convinced employers to fire strikebreakers who had been employed and much of the first convention of the ALPA, held in Chicago in October 1932, focused on the Century Airlines strike. By the mid-1930s the ALPA had close to 100% of all commercial pilots in the U.S. on its rolls.Cohen, p.319. Furthermore, the ALPA had established itself as a strong political voice and managed to lobby for improved wage calculations for pilots which took into account both the hours and mileage flown, thus insuring that wages wouldn’t be affected by the development of faster planes.\\"Pay Scale For Pilots Proposed”. Los Angeles Times. May 12, 1934. E.L. Cord became the largest stockholder in the American Aviation Corporation, buying an extra 100,000 shares on top of the 138,000 he received from the sale of Century.Van der Linden, Robert. Airlines and Air Mail:The Post Office and the Birth of the Commercial Aviation Industry. P.230  Historical interpretation  Isaac Cohen uses the Century Air Lines strike to draw comparisons with the 1983 strike of Continental Airlines pilots. He emphasizes that the political climate of 1932, in contrast with 1983, made conditions far more favorable for the striking pilots stating, “the pro- regulatory mood of 1932 generated governmental, congressional, and municipal support for ALPA, increased considerably the bargaining power of organized pilots, and, in turn, played a key role in ALPA's victory over Errett Lobban Cord.”Cohen, p.315 For Cohen, the still heavy regulatory presence of the Post Office in commercial airlines in 1932, combined with a political arena that was “becoming increasingly responsive to the demands of organized labor” ensured that significant political weight could be thrown behind efforts to undermine Cord.Cohen, p.316-317 Robert Van der Linden too underscores the political pressure Cord was facing during the strike and also during the months leading up to it as his attempts to curry favor for deregulation had been met with antagonism. However, Van der Linden argues that the sale of Century to AVCO which ended the strike, rather than being the last resort of a beaten man, had been part of Cord’s plan all along: \\"Cord, a master of the financial world, understood AVCO's weak position and sought to exploit the situation if his public attempts to secure an air mail contract failed. By early 1932, as it became clear that Cord was losing his public fight, he turned his attention directly to AVCO...\\"Van der Linden, p.229 Within a year, Cord had managed to gain complete control of AVCO.Van der Linden, p.234  See also  *Air Mail scandal *United States government role in civil aviation  References  Category:1932 in aviation Category:1932 labor disputes and strikes Category:Aviation history of the United States Category:Aviation strikes Category:Labor disputes in the United States Category:Transportation labor disputes in the United States Category:1932 in the United States ","title":"Century Airlines pilots' strike"},{"id":"39452971","text":"Max Rose is a 2016 American drama film written and directed by Daniel Noah, and distributed by Paladin Films.

Despite being named Barbera bianca, the grape is not a color mutation of the red Piedmontese wine grape Barbera that is the third most widely planted grape variety in Italy. In fact, DNA analysis conducted in the early 21st century shows no genetic relationship at all between the two grape varieties.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 85–88, 187 Allen Lane 2012 Barbera bianca is noted for its high acidity levels, the vast majority of it tartaric rather than malic acid. This propensity for high acid lends the grape well to sparkling wine production. Barbera bianca is a permitted grape variety in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Colli Tortonesi produced in the province of Alessandria. History Barbera bianca is believed to have gotten its name due to the similarities in the size and shape of its grape clusters with the red Piedmont wine grape Barbera (pictured). The exact origins of Barbera bianca are not yet known but the grape has been growing in the Piedmont region of Italy since at least the early 19th century when it was described in an 1825 document. Ampelographers believe that the grape got its name due to morphological similarities with Barbera, particularly the size and shape of the berries and grape clusters of both vines. However, DNA profiling in the early 21st century showed that the two grapes are distinct varieties with no known genetic relationship between them. Viticulture Barbera bianca is a mid-ripening grape variety that is prone to producing high yields if not kept in check with winter pruning and late season green harvesting. Even at full ripeness, the grapes have very high levels of tartaric acid. Wine regions The Colli Tortonesi wine region in the province of Alessandria. In 2000, there were 280 hectares (690 acres) of Barbera bianca planted in Italy, nearly all of it in the province of Alessandria. It is most commonly found in older vineyards around the communes of Acqui Terme and Alessandria. Here the grape is often blended with other white wine grape varieties such as Cortese, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, Timorasso and Vermentino which can help temper Barbera bianca's high acid levels. Some winemakers utilize the grape's acidity for the production of light-bodied sparkling wines. It is a permitted variety in the white wines of the Colli Tortonesi DOC. Relationship to other grapes Unlike the relationship between Pinot blanc and Grenache blanc with Pinot noir and Grenache, respectively, Barbera bianca is not a color mutation of Barbera and, in fact, has no known genetic relationship with Piedmontese grape. Despite sharing several synonyms, Barbera bianca also has no known relation with Carica l'Asino, another Piedmontese grape that likely originated in the Liguria wine region and is sometimes blended with Barbera bianca. Likewise, the red Campanian grape Barbera del Sannio that is used in the Sannio DOC and the Sardinian wine grape Barbera Sarda are also unrelated to Barbera bianca. Synonyms Over the years Barbera bianca has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Bertolino, Bertoulin, Caria l'Aso, Lardera, Lardera bianca, Lardera delle Langhe, Martinella, Martinetta, Ovata bianca, Peigein, Peigin, Peisìn, Peisin, Poison bianco, Poisino and Uva Ovata.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Barbera bianca Accessed: May 21st, 2013 References Category:White wine grape varieties ","title":"Barbera bianca"},{"id":"39453074","text":"120px These are the films directed, produced and distributed by the Thanhouser Company, the pioneering American motion picture studio of New Rochelle, New York. 1910 Daddy's Double * The Actor's Children * St. Elmo * She's Done It Again * Daddy's Double * A 29-Cent Robbery * The Old Shoe Came Back * Her Battle For Existence * Sand Man's Cure * She Wanted To Marry A Hero * The Cigars His Wife Bought * Jane Eyre * The Best Man Wins * Cupid At The Circus * The Winter's Tale * The Girl Of The Northern Woods * The Two Roses * The Writing On The Wall * The Woman Hater * The Little Hero Of Holland * Roosevelt's Return * Thelma * The Governor's Daughter * Tempest And Sunshine * The Flag Of His Country * Booming Business * Gone To Coney Island * The Girl Strike Leader * The Lucky Shot * The Converted Deacon * The Girls Of The Ghetto * The Playwright's Love * Uncle Tom's Cabin * The Mermaid * The Jenks' Day Off * The Restoration * The Mad Hermit * Lena Rivers * The Girl Reporter * She Stoops To Conquer * A Dainty Politician * The Latchkey * An Assisted Elopement * A Fresh Start * Mother * The Doctor's Carriage * Tangled Lives * The Stolen Invention * Not Guilty * The Convict * The Hero's Jealous Wife * Home Made Mince Pie * Dots And Dashes * Leon Of The Table D'hote * Avenged * Pocahontas * Delightful Dolly * Oh, What A Knight!

In total, more than 70 daily incoming and outgoing trips were cancelled in Seattle.seattle daily times, November 3, 1983 pp.1,19  Deregulation and Competition  Several significant events acted as compounding catalysts for the strike of 1983. Among them were a series of federal deregulations of the transportation industry in the 1970s and 80's and an increase in competition from Greyhound's main competitor Trailways as well as from smaller newer market entries.  Airline Deregulation Act of 1978  On October 24, 1978, the 95th congress signed the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. Like the Federal Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982, this law allowed airlines greater control over its operations and increased the market ease of entry for entrepreneurs.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/bdquery/z?d095:SN02493:@@@L&summ2;=m& This had the sum effect of reducing airline fares to the point they became competitive with bus fares. For example, both People Express and Southwest Airlines were able to charge less than Greyhound for many destinations.  Federal Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982  On September 20, 1982, the 97th congress enacted into law the Federal Bus Regulatory Reform Act of 1982. The law deregulated many aspects of the bus industry, most noticeably by reducing restrictions on bus lines to add or remove stops and by increasing the ease of entry of entrepreneurs into the bus service market.thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d097:HR03663:@@@L&summ2;=m& Shortly following the enactment of the new law, the Interstate Commerce Commission received over 2000 applications to operate new bus services. Congress had been heavily lobbied by members of the bus industry to approve deregulation and Greyhound Bus Lines itself had insisted that some of its managers write letters to Congress in support of the bill.interview with ex- manager, Greyhound Bus Lines  Bus Competition  In 1982, the Amalgamated Transit Union agreed to a wage freeze of its members working for Trailways Bus Lines. Trailways' future was threatened financially and the ATU accepted the freeze in order to keep its members employed. With lower labor costs, Trailways was able to better compete, and over the course of the next months ridership fell considerably for Greyhound Bus Lines. At the same time, Greyhound was losing business to small new market entries such as Rohrer Bus Lines on the East Coast. Trailways also had affiliates nationwide who would carry the Trailways logo but were actually small independent companies. By the middle of 1983, Greyhound had reported 34 million dollars in operating losses from the previous two years. Greyhound blamed this loss in revenue to their comparably higher labor cost; 62% as opposed to 40% for its competitors.seattle daily times, November 9, 1983  The Seattle Strike Timeline   Contract Negotiations between Greyhound and the ATU  In 1983, as a response to increasing competition and decreasing revenue, Greyhound Bus Lines came to the negotiating table with a 9.5% pay reduction and additional benefit reduction for drivers and terminal workers resulting in an overall compensation reduction of 17% to 25%. The ATU rejected this proposal and ended negotiations on October 31, 1983.  Drivers walk off the job (November 2, 1983)  On November 2, 1983 at 11pm, after 48 hours of notice, 175 Greyhound bus drivers and terminal workers who were members of ATU L1384 and ATU L1055 walked off the job. Picket lines were set at the terminal on 8th avenue and Stewart St. and at the maintenance garage at 1250 Denny Way. The picketers headquartered themselves at the Camlin Hotel in Downtown Seattle.  ATU L587 honors Greyhound Strike (November 7, 1983)  While workers from L587 did not walk off the job, they vowed support for their fellow ATU workers.seattle daily times, November 7, 1983 p.14  Greyhound Ultimatum (November 8, 1983)  Greyhound Bus Lines sent a letter to the union telling workers it must decide whether or not they would be returning to work by Monday November 14, or else they would be replaced by new hires. At this point, 45,000 job applicants had already been interviewed nationwide.seattle daily times, November 8, 1983  Greyhound offers half price fares (November 15, 1983)  Greyhound Bus lines announced half price fares would be in effect between November 17 and December 15. Strike negotiations remained at an impasse with Greyhound rejecting a 3 year pay freeze offered by the ATU.seattle daily times, November 15, 1983  First sign of violence (November 15, 1983)  A day after the return to work deadline, a picketer was struck by a vehicle being driven by a non-striking Greyhound mechanic. Fault remained undetermined, and the picketer did not suffer life-threatening injuries.  Violence erupts (November 17, 1983)  200 strikers confronted the first Greyhound bus to depart from Seattle since the strike began. The bus was being driven by a non union driver and was heading to Portland. 15 police officers clashed with picketers while police in riot gear stood by. The bus suffered damage to its headlights and windshield wipers.  Strike Ends (December 3rd, 1983 - December 20th, 1983)  On December 3, 1983, Union leaders and Greyhound Bus Lines reached a tentative agreement to end the strike.seattle daily times, December 4th, 1983 The agreement reduced wages by 7.8% instead of the originally proposed 9.5%. In addition, workers took a 4% cut in pension benefits and accepted a new pay schedule that compensated new hires at 20 to 25% less than before.http://www.angelfire.com/al/silverball/strikes.html On December 19, 1983, the TA was ratified by the membership, and workers returned to work the next day.  Effect on Rural Communities of Washington state  During the strike, rural towns, like the city of Ephrata, in Eastern Washington were hardest hit by the Seattle strike because there were no alternative forms of public transportation.seattle daily times, November 6, 1983 Shortly after the strike began, Greyhound Bus Lines announced that it would drop service to 1325 rural communities nationwide and in Washington state; by December 2, 1983, 4 rural bus routes were cancelled. The routes were Olympia to Toledo, Vancouver to Maryhill, Colfax to Rosalia and Ephrata to Spokane. Earlier in the year the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission had denied requests stating that the affected communities did not have meaningful alternatives to Greyhound Bus Services. After deregulation of the industry, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved reduction of service to these areas.seattle daily times, December 2, 1983  Greyhound Continues to Operate During Strike  The day after the strike began, about 20,000 people went to Greyhound offices around the country to replace the 12,500 striking ATU workers.seattle daily times, November 4, 1983 Over the course of three days, 500 applications were submitted in Seattle alone.seattle daily times, November 6, 1983. During this time, Trailways, Greyhound's competitor, had an 800 percent increase in bus business in Seattle alone. By November 17, 1983 Greyhound buses were rolling again from the Seattle terminal.seattle daily times, November 17, 1983  Aftermath  The strike signaled the start of a slow decline of the bus industry in general and Greyhound specifically. 1984 was marked by 1500 layoffs, and the year afterwards Greyhound sold 120 terminals and laid off an additional 2000 employees. Many of its routes were then franchised to smaller competitors. After acquiring Trailways and absorbing 1400 of their employees, a round of negotiations in 1989 ended with another strike in June 1990. More violent than the last, the strike of 1990 saw shootings and bomb threats and the death of a picketer. This strike lasted until 1993.

Establishment Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd was established in the erstwhile Hyderabad State in 1938 by the Nizam of Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan, with actual production beginning in 1942. This makes it one of the oldest paper mills in the country. In the 1950s, the Birla family group of industries took over the mill and was later it was transferred to the Poddars. It was owned by R. K. Poddar at the time of its closure. Closure At the time of the closure, the mill employed about 3000 workers. The management team cited increasing raw material costs and unavailability of reliable power as the major reasons that impacted the profitability of the plant. Production at the mill had been shut down from September 2014 to August 2018. Acquisition by JK Paper Efforts were started by the Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao government in Telangana to attract new investors to restart production at the mill and boost the local economy, which was heavily dependent on it. The Harsh Pati Singhania-promoted JK Paper Ltd has taken over the ailing sick paper mill, The Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd, located at Kagaznagar in Telangana district. The takeover comes after the National Company Law Tribunal, Hyderabad had on July 19 approved the Rs 782-crore resolution plan. According to the JK Paper management, “The acquisition provides a growth opportunity to JK Paper to expand its existing line of business of paper and paper board.” The company has secured approval from the NCLT Hyderabad Bench and acquired 76.37 per cent stake comprising 13,90,00,000 shares of face value of Rs 10 each. JK Paper does not require approval from the Competition Commission of India as the target business is within the prescribed exemption threshold as per the regulations. As per the arrangement, Rs 371 crore has been settled by the company and its JK Enviro-tech Ltd, towards corporate insolvency resolution process cost, admitted operational creditors, workmen and employees dues among others, as per the terms of the Resolution Plan. This consists of cash payment of Rs 165 crore and issue of securities consisting of equity shares of Rs 43 crore and preference shares of Rs 162 crore by Sirpur Paper Mills Ltd. The company has issued equity shares of SPML through primary subscription at the face value of Rs 10 each. After the lenders lifted the seizure of the paper mills, Harsh Pati Singhania, Vice-Chairman and Managing Director of JK Paper, and others opened the paper mill, which will play a major role in the revival of the economy in the newly carved out Komaram Bheem district, where the mill is located. Significantly, KT Rama Rao, Telangana IT and Industries Minister, and local MLA Koneru Konappa, played a role in facilitating the takeover of the mill by ensuring that the State extends certain concessions, which will make the mill viable. JK Paper shares were trading at Rs 148.80, up 5.48 per cent on the BSE.

China is the world leader in lettuce production, producing half of the world's lettuce. Stem lettuce is grown in the country and the stems are prepared as a cooked vegetable. According to estimates given by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 2006, China produced around 11,005,000 metric tonnes of lettuce on 500,250 hectares of land. In 2010, the FAO reported that some of lettuce were produced during that year. Taiwan is also a producer of good quality head lettuce, which is an export commodity. History China first started growing lettuce (Lactuta sativa L.) in the seventh century, according to one source, although another source writes that lettuce was introduced earlier, in the fifth century. It is not quite clear as to how lettuce got to China. The country has long been the leading lettuce producer in the world, with roughly of lettuce produced in 2005, and on in 2006. China accounts for around half of the world's total lettuce production. Agriculture As per FAO's Preliminary Statistics for 2011 for China, the area under lettuce and chicory was with a total production of 13.431 million tonnes. Most of the lettuce produced in China is purchased and consumed within the country. The common types of lettuce grown are the Butterhead (Lactuca sativa var. capitata), the Crisphead (Lactuca sativa var. capitata), the Looseleaf (Lactuca sativa var. crispa), the Romaine (Lactuca sativa var. longifolia), and the Celtuce. Celtuce is grown widely in the country and its stems are prepared as a cooked vegetable. Celtuce (Lactuca sativa var. angustana), an endemic plant of China, is also called stem lettuce. The name is derived from two words “celery” and “lettuce.” It is succulent, has thick stem and tender leaves. The plant grows to a height of 10 to 12 inches and has leaves at the end, similar to that of lettuce. Its skin tastes bitter, and hence is removed by paring it and leaving only the green core of it which is soft and translucent. Prickly lettuce or China lettuce (Lactuca serriola) is also a variety grown in waste lands along roadsides, yards and gardens. It is an irrigated crop that is suited to grow on light or dry soils. In Taiwan, head lettuce is an export crop (40–50% produce exported) grown in the sub-tropical mountainous area, which is suitable (due to its cool climate) for its cultivation. This crop is a good source of vitamin A and folic acid. It is green in colour and has crisp leaves and is of the compact variety. Though low in calories it is a vitamin and mineral supplement. Stem lettuce provides vitamin C and also calcium. Culinary dishes Woju (莴苣), a lettuce variety grown for its stem used in Chinese cooking, sold in a Yangzhou supermarket In China, lettuce is not eaten in a raw form of salad. The preferred common usage is in plain form as stir-fried (cooked for a short time) and occasionally mixed with mushroom and other vegetables, and well spiced with garnishing. It is also steamed individually. It is also used in combination with meat dishes such as “Sliced Pork Stir Fried with Lettuce.” Lettuce soups are also common, along with fish or minced chicken. For this preparation, fresh and crisp lettuce is chosen and the soup is consumed hot and not allowed to go tasteless. Other varieties of dishes are “Lettuce and fermented Bean Cake” and “Clear Simmered Bean Card with Lettuce and Cellophane Noodles.” Stem lettuce, which originated in China, is cooked and used as a food item. Culture It is common belief in China that lettuce is a symbol for wealth and good luck. It is a festive food during birthdays, New Year's Day and several other festive occasions. Celtuce is pickled and used as a side dish during meals. Gallery File:HK Food 生菜包 1.JPGMeal served on lettuce in Hong Kong.

Built near the end of the nineteenth century after the end of a county seat war, it is the fifth courthouse to serve Perry County, and it has been named a historic site because of its imposing architecture. History After Perry County was established in 1817, the county commissioners and courts met for their first two years at John Fink's tavern on the eastern side of Somerset at the corner of Main Street (the Zane Trace) and High Street. At the end of the two years, county officials began using their newly completed jail as a courthouse; it was a jail more than anything else, and the commissioners and other people did not like to call it a courthouse, but a courtroom was provided in the second story, as well as room for other county officers. It functioned as a courthouse from 1819 until 1829. In 1826, bids were let for the construction of a purpose-built courthouse on Somerset's public square; it was occupied three years later, and the old \\"courthouse\\" jail soon succumbed to fire. Ever since the creation of the county, the village of New Lexington had been agitating to become the county seat, and a county seat war ensued in the 1850s; after three new state laws, three elections, and two decisions by the Supreme Court, the county offices departed Somerset for the upstart community in early 1857,Thrane, Susan W. County Courthouses of Ohio. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2000, 119-120. leaving the old courthouse to be used by Somerset as its village hall.Borchers, Perry E. Written Historical and Descriptive Data: Old Perry County Court House, Historic American Buildings Survey, 1959-06, 1. Accessed 2012-11-24. The first courthouse at New Lexington was not paid for by the taxpayers in general, because advocates of New Lexington as county seat had raised the necessary amount through private donations. Among the stipulations of the state law permitting the removal of the county seat was that suitable buildings should be provided if the seat were to be moved; such a building was finished, but it stood vacant for several years before the offices were placed in it.Martzolff, Clement Luther. History of Perry County, Ohio. New Lexington: Ward and Weiland, 1902, 134. As the end of the nineteenth century approached, the county's needs expanded to the point that the old courthouse was insufficient, and a fifth courthouse, the present structure, was erected in 1887 and dedicated one year later. Architecture Designed by Joseph W. Yost, and built at a cost of $143,000, the present Perry County Courthouse is a large Richardsonian Romanesque building constructed of stone; the ashlar walls are laid in a random fashion, while the ashlar of the foundation is laid in a more regular manner. Visitors can enter the building through a grand recessed entrance under an archway at the top of a grand staircase; upon reaching the interior, they find themselves in a hallway with a tiled floor and plaster reliefs on the walls between the entrances for various county offices. The most prominent component of the exterior is the two-part clock tower in the center, which rises above the street, but the entire building derives an appearance of great size from its three-story constructionOwen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1136-1137. and from the large monolithic wall above the main entrance. Its Romanesque influence is apparent from details such as the miniature turrets above the main entrance and on the corners of the tower. From its earliest years, the courthouse has been considered one of Ohio's grandest, due in part to its location in a small community in a rural county. Jail Located behind the courthouse is the old county jail, a three-story brick building. Also constructed in 1887, it succeeded the old courthouse as the jail; the 1857 courthouse included dedicated jail space on its first floor.Graham, A.A., ed. History of Fairfield and Perry Counties, Ohio: Their Past and Present. Chicago: Beers, 1883. Recent history Courthouse and jail together In 1981, the Perry County Courthouse and its jail were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying for designation both because of their architecture and because of their place in Ohio's history. In the 1990s, the courthouse attracted statewide attention when a prominent lawsuit, DeRolph v. State, was filed in the Perry County Common Pleas Court. Claiming that Ohio's existing system of school funding violated the state constitution, a coalition of school districts in southern Ohio sued the state in 1991 in order to force through a fundamental change in school funding.Drew, James. \\"Coalition Legal Fees $3.6M and Growing: Ohio Taxpayers Foot Bills for Columbus Firm's Work\\". The Blade, 2001-06-17. Accessed 2013-05-22. Upon the county judge's ruling in favor of the coalition three years later, the lawsuit was appealed through the courts and received numerous trials in all levels of the Ohio judiciary throughout the rest of the decade, including multiple decisions by the Supreme Court.

It is often used to help the parents of the baby keep it safe and comfortable in the home. Before baby furniture, parents would sleep with their children in their own beds, which could be dangerous for the child. Eventually, infant beds started to be built with the child's safety in mind; the intention was to keep the baby from rolling off the bed, so mangers and bassinets were created. Over time, more furniture was created with the infant's safety in mind, and there are several types and functionalities of these. Typical pieces include an infant bed (such as a crib, bassinet, or cradle), changing table, high chair, playpen, baby walker, and toy chest. Products, features, and costs vary between countries and have changed over time. Safety is of paramount importance.  Safety Procedures for Changing Tables  Many authorities state that the best way to prevent a child from falling from a changing table is to modify the table. This includes guardrails that are at least two inches on all sides, concave changing surfaces, and safety straps. Authorities also recommend keeping all necessary supplies within arms reach and to inspect the changing table before placing the child on the table. It is also important for parents to utilize safe procedures, such as proper lifting technique and using height-appropriate changing tables.  Safety Procedures for Strollers  Strollers (also known as push chairs or buggies) are a mean of transportation for infants up to around the age of 3 or 4. Variants of strollers include twin strollers as well as triple strollers. Strollers come typically with multiple functionalities including an umbrella like roof to prevent a large amount of sun to enter the stroller, the ability to detach the seat and become a car seat, the ability to fold for ease of transportation by car, and more as new designs and features are being created.

The circle has the property that the solutions of the quadratic equation are the horizontal coordinates of the intersections of the circle with the horizontal axis. Carlyle circles have been used to develop ruler-and-compass constructions of regular polygons. Definition Carlyle circle of the quadratic equation x2 − sx + p = 0\\\\. Given the quadratic equation :x2 − sx + p = 0 the circle in the coordinate plane having the line segment joining the points A(0, 1) and B(s, p) as a diameter is called the Carlyle circle of the quadratic equation. E. John Hornsby, Jr.: Geometrical and Graphical Solutions of Quadratic Equations. The College Mathematics Journal, Vol. 21, No. 5 (Nov., 1990), pp. 362–369 (JSTOR) (JSTOR) Defining property The defining property of the Carlyle circle can be established thus: the equation of the circle having the line segment AB as diameter is :x(x − s) + (y − 1)(y − p) = 0\\\\. The abscissas of the points where the circle intersects the x-axis are the roots of the equation (obtained by setting y = 0 in the equation of the circle) :x2 − sx + p = 0\\\\. Construction of regular polygons Construction of regular pentagon using Carlyle circles Construction of a regular heptadecagon using Carlyle circles Construction of a regular 257-gon using Carlyle circles Regular pentagon The problem of constructing a regular pentagon is equivalent to the problem of constructing the roots of the equation :z5 − 1 = 0\\\\. One root of this equation is z0 = 1 which corresponds to the point P0(1, 0). Removing the factor corresponding to this root, the other roots turn out to be roots of the equation :z4 + z3 + z2 + z + 1 = 0\\\\. These roots can be represented in the form ω, ω2, ω3, ω4 where ω = exp (2i/5). Let these correspond to the points P1, P2, P3, P4. Letting :p1 = ω + ω4, p2 = ω2 + ω3 we have :p1 + p2 = −1, p1p2 = −1\\\\. (These can be quickly shown to be true by direct substitution into the quartic above and noting that ω6 = ω, and ω7 = ω2.) So p1 and p2 are the roots of the quadratic equation :x2 + x − 1 = 0\\\\. The Carlyle circle associated with this quadratic has a diameter with endpoints at (0, 1) and (−1, −1) and center at (−1/2, 0). Carlyle circles are used to construct p1 and p2. From the definitions of p1 and p2 it also follows that :p1 = 2 cos (2/5), p2 = 2 cos (4/5). These are then used to construct the points P1, P2, P3, P4. This detailed procedure involving Carlyle circles for the construction of regular pentagons is given below. #Draw a circle in which to inscribe the pentagon and mark the center point O. #Draw a horizontal line through the center of the circle. Mark one intersection with the circle as point B. #Construct a vertical line through the center. Mark one intersection with the circle as point A. #Construct the point M as the midpoint of O and B. #Draw a circle centered at M through the point A. This is the Carlyle circle for x2 + x − 1 = 0\\\\. Mark its intersection with the horizontal line (inside the original circle) as the point W and its intersection outside the circle as the point V. These are the points p1 and p2 mentioned above. #Draw a circle of radius OA and center W. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. #Draw a circle of radius OA and center V. It intersects the original circle at two of the vertices of the pentagon. #The fifth vertex is the intersection of the horizontal axis with the original circle. Regular heptadecagon There is a similar method involving Carlyle circles to construct regular heptadecagons. The figure to the right illustrates the procedure. Regular 257-gon To construct a regular 257-gon using Carlyle circles, as many as 24 Carlyle circles are to be constructed. One of these is the circle to solve the quadratic equation x2 + x − 64 = 0. Regular 65537-gon There is a procedure involving Carlyle circles for the construction of a regular 65537-gon. However there are practical problems for the implementation of the procedure; for example, it requires the construction of the Carlyle circle for the solution of the quadratic equation x2 + x − 214 = 0. History Carlyle's solution to Leslie's problem. The black line segment is divided in two segments in such a way that the two segments form a rectangle (green) being of equal area to another given rectangle (red). According to Howard Eves (1911–2004) the mathematician John Leslie (1766–1832) described the geometric construction of roots of a quadratic equation with a circle in his book Elements of Geometry and noted that this idea was provided by his former student Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881). See for instance Hornsby, DeTemple or Howard Eves: An Introduction into the History of Mathematics. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 3rd edition, 1969, p. 73 However while the description in Leslie's book contains an analogous circle construction, it was presented solely in elementary geometric terms without the notion of a Cartesian coordinate system or a quadratic function and its roots:John Leslie: Elements of geometry and plane trigonometry: With an appendix, and copious notes and illustrations. Archibald Constable & Co, 3. Ausgabe, 1817, pp. 176, 340 (online copy (Google)). Note that the comment about Carlyle is not contained in earlier editions of the book (1809, 1811). In 1867 the Austrian engineer Eduard Lill published a graphical method to determine the roots of a polynomial (Lill's method). If it is applied on a quadratic function, then it yields the trapezoid figure from Carlyle's solution to Leslie's problem (see graphic) with one of its sides being the diameter of the Carlyle circle. In an article from 1925 G. A. Miller pointed out that a slight modification of Lill's method applied to a normed quadratic function yields a circle that allows the geometric construction of the roots of that function and gave the explicit modern definition of what was later to be called Carlyle circle.G. A. Miller: Geometric Solution of the Quadratic Equation. The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 12, No. 179 (Dec., 1925), pp. 500–501 (JSTOR) Eves used the circle in the modern sense in one of the exercises of his book Introduction to the History of Mathematics (1953) and pointed out the connection to Leslie and Carlyle. Later publications started to adopt the names Carlyle circle , Carlyle method or Carlyle algorithm, though in German speaking countries the term Lill circle (Lill-Kreis) is used as well.Rainer Kaenders (ed.), Reinhard Schmidt (ed.): Mit GeoGebra mehr Mathematik verstehen. Springer Spektrum, 2nd edition, 2014, , pp. 68-71 (German) DeTemple used in 1989 and 1991 Carlyle circles to devise Compass- and-straightedge constructions for regular polygons, in particular the pentagon, the heptadecagon, the 257-gon and the 65537-gon. Ladislav Beran described in 1999, how the Carlyle circle can be used to construct the complex roots of a normed quadratic function.Ladislav Beran: The Complex Roots of a Quadratic from a Circle.

Carlton, a merchant from Massachusetts. He attended Beloit College in Wisconsin. He accepted a clerk position in the mercantile trade after graduation. Carlton became ill with tuberculosis and came to Colorado in 1889 to improve his health. His health improved dramatically by 1891. Carlton was a dry goods store clerk in Colorado Springs. Latching on to the 1891 gold boom in Cripple Creek, Carlton started a freight hauling business from Colorado Midland at Divide with his brother, Leslie. The Colorado Trading and Transfer Company served the mining communities, and \\"eventually gained control of much of the freight business\\" serving the mining towns. Based upon the income from his freight business, Carlton invested in mines, banks and railroads. He invested in the Colorado Midland Railroad to carry freight and in businesses in Cripple Creek. King of Cripple Creek He was named \\"King of Cripple Creek\\" due to the success of his mines there, including Cresson Mine,\\"one of the most profitable mines in the town.\\" He owned \\"nearly every mine in Cripple Creek\\" and became a millionaire by 1930. Carlton House Carlton and his wife, Ethel Frizzell-Carlton, built the Carlton House in Pine Valley, Colorado Springs. Carlton purchased the property in 1928 from William A. Otis to build a home for his wife. Mrs. Carlton had become enamored of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture during her travels across Southern California. Subsequently architect Richard Requa was hired to design their home.

Costantini created portraits of writers and artists for newspapers, and illustrated several novels. His early works were inspired by the novelist Franz Kafka, and by literary, utopian and anarchist ideals. His later work presented a pessimistic view of civilization. He created series of paintings exploring historical themes: Anarchy, the wreck of the Titanic, alchemy and Mozart, the French Revolution and its victims, Yekaterinburg and the murder of Nicholas II and his family. His last series offered a dark reading of Pinocchio, which he considered one of the three or four greatest Italian novels. Biography Early life In September 1926 he was born in Rome to middle-class parents, and his father was an amateur painter. As a child, he was crafty, and kept a diary accompanied with newspaper cut-outs, collages, photos and drawings. At a renowned Roman high school, he failed French and Latin. World War II Costantini's experiences during World War II led his focus to the suffering and meaninglessness of the world; it was at this time, too, that he became interested in utopianism. He graduated as sea captain, served in the Italian Navy, and 1951 to 1954 was employed in the Merchant Marine. He moved with his family to Rapallo and in 1959, after a visit to Spain, devoted a series of paintings to bullfighting.Costantini, ed. Francesca Danovaro and Matteo Fochessati, Genoa, Nugae, 2010. He was a member of the artists' group that founded the Galleria del Deposito in Boccadasse, Genoa. Other members were Eugenio Carmi, Emanuele Luzzati, Carlo Vita, etc. A collector of old illustrated magazines, he used this material to create in his Rapallo home and studio paintings and portraits, which typically include period pieces and advertisements. He often depicted scenes in Genoa (squares, shops, buildings, boats), contrasting the old and the new. Philip Levine's poem \\"On a Drawing by Flavio\\", describes Costantini's stark portrait of the Rabbi of Auschwitz, who \\"bows his head and prays / for us all\\". Costantini died in Genoa after a short illness. A memorial meeting, with talks by friends and critics, was held on 12 June 2013 at the Museo Luzzati, Genoa, which holds a number of his works. Inspiration He first experimented with illustration after his time spent in the Italian navy doing drawings of Kafka's work. \\"His earliest ventures into art were motivated more by intellectual frustration than by artistic masters. 'I started to draw because I read the Kafka books… it was impossible to write like Kafka, so I began to draw'. Other writers followed, but it was the human condition as portrayed by Kafka that was to remain the dominant influence in Costantini’s world.\\" \\"Obituary: FLAVIO COSTANTINI (Rome, 21 September 1926—Rapallo, 20 May 2013)\\". Christie Books. 21 May 2013. Site accessed 1 June 2013. But it wasn't until the 1960s when he read Victor Serge's Memoires of a Revolutionary that he began to champion anarchism through his works.

The film was written, directed and produced by Eileen Yaghoobian who filmed on location in 30 different states from 2004 to 2007. It features posters for Radiohead, White Stripes, Arcade Fire, The Flaming Lips, The Melvins, Nick Cave, Broken Social Scene, Black Keys, Sonic Youth, Pearl Jam, Queens of the Stone Age, Bob Dylan and Marianne Faithfull. Poster artists whose work appear in the film include Ames Bros, Amy Jo Hendrickson, Dan Grzeca, Methane Studios, Todd Slater and Zachary Hobbs. Showing The film was an Official Selection of the 2009 SXSW Film Festival, 2008 Montreal World Film Festival and the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International Film Festival. The film opened its theatrical run at the IFC Center (NYC) and ICA London (UK).

Music  Mark Greenberg of the band The Coctails created 16 original tracks for the film. Brian Chippendale of Lightning Bolt (band) and Black Pus are featured. Reception The film received mixed reviews with most reviewers praising the film's visual concept and some criticizing its disorganization, and some praised its free-form group portrait of people, Peter Rainer of NPR points to the films deconstruction as “Raw -- an outlaw movie about outlaw artists”. Ward Sutton of the Village Voice wrote that \\"Died Young Stayed Pretty is a captivating artifact of an era\\".Village Voice, Ward Sutton, 07/17/09 \\"Ward Sutton Makes the Case for Posters as Art (Or Junk)\\" Film critic V.A. Musetto of the New York Post gave the film three out of four stars writing, \\"Yaghoobian's nonlinear editing is as offbeat as the posters…She lets scenes run a few seconds longer than most directors would—to good effect\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that it \\"presents a lot of good art and entertaining personalities..., but lacks any organizing principal or precise point.\\" Vadim Rizov of IndieWire/Spout published a very favorable review praising the editing structure, \\"Yaghoobian lives for tangents, by- ways, one-offs, weird interview interruptions and non sequiturs; this is the most-edited documentary I've seen in a while, and one of the best-edited too. She's amped up the non-linear, multi-dialectical logic of Fast, Cheap & Out Of Control to a faster tempo (if not as strangely affecting, it has an equally eccentric score by Mark Greenberg).\\" On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film is rated 63% based on the reviews of 30 critics.

Headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, the organization has operations in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, and was founded by the Catholic Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace in 1976. In 2020 it was claimed that they fired an emergency room physician for raising concerns that the hospital had insufficient measures in place to manage COVID-19. History In 1890, nuns of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Peace moved to Fairhaven, Washington, from the convent in Newark, New Jersey, to establish a hospital for loggers. The order continued to build hospitals and in 1936 opened their first one in Oregon, Pacific Christian Hospital in Eugene. After continued growth, the Sisters formed a non-profit health care system in 1976, and in 1994 the name was changed to PeaceHealth. In 1997, PeaceHealth merged its SelectCare health insurance plan with Providence Health & Services, which at the time PeaceHealth was based in Eugene. PeaceHealth merged with Southwest Washington Health System in December 2010, and moved its headquarters from Bellevue, Washington, to Vancouver, Washington. At the time, PeaceHealth had annual revenues of approximately $1.3 billion and operated seven hospitals. The organization announced an alliance with University of Washington Medical Center in May 2013, which the American Civil Liberties Union criticized due to PeaceHealth following Catholic medical care directives. Operations PeaceHealth operates ten hospitals in three states. In Alaska, it runs PeaceHealth Ketchikan Medical Center in Ketchikan. In Oregon, PeaceHealth operates Sacred Heart Medical Center, University District (Eugene), Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend (Springfield), Peace Harbor Medical Center (Florence), and Cottage Grove Community Medical Center (Cottage Grove).

He is principally remembered for his work on reforming Nebraska's agricultural laws and for his stint in the 1880s as publisher of the Falls City Journal. Early life and education Pepoon was born in Lake County, Ohio on August 29, 1836. His fiercely abolitionist parents named him after Theodore Weld. He moved with his parents and siblings to Jo Daviess County in far northwestern Illinois in 1850. For a time he attended the Mount Carroll Seminary (known today as Shimer College), where his sister was serving as an instructor of mathematics. He later leveraged this \\"practical education\\" for work as a teacher and a railroad clerk. In 1860, Pepoon married another former student of the Mount Carroll Seminary, Susan Robinson. She was from nearby Savanna, and was four years his junior. On March 29, 1865, Pepoon joined the 96th Illinois infantry, later transferring to Company K of the 21st infantry. He did not see action, and mustered out in January 1866. According to his account, he did not join the Union army earlier only because he had been unable to leave the family farm unattended, all four of his brothers having enlisted. In 1869, Pepoon and other members of his family moved to Table Rock, Nebraska, where he purchased a 250-acre homestead. Career In 1876, Pepoon was elected to the Nebraska State Senate, the state legislature then being bicameral. Among the legislation that he successfully sponsored was an 1877 amendment to the state railroad law, requiring railroad companies to reimburse livestock owners for livestock struck by trains. Another required that livestock cars be cleaned to help \\"prevent the spread of hog cholera and kindred diseases.\\" In 1881, Pepoon bought a half-interest in the Falls City Journal, and moved to Falls City to work as the paper's editor and publisher. In this capacity, he strove to ensure that the paper reflected his own Radical Republican sensibilities. He remained connected with the paper until 1885. Pepoon and his wife moved to Hardy, Arkansas in the late 1890s. When she died a few years later, Pepoon went to live with his daughters in Thayer, Missouri. He died there in October or November 1910.

In the sixteenth century, the first shah of the Safavid Dynasty, Ismail I (r. 1486-1524) established Shia Islam as the state religion. The Safavid Dynasty would have a strict policy of enforcing Shia Islam, which would bring political conflict with the Sunnis of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire.  Russian & Soviet rule  In 1806, Northern Azerbaijan was annexed by the Russian Empire from the Persian Qajar Dynasty, this region also included Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1918, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918 - 20) declared independence from Russia during the Russian Civil war. But was promptly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920. During the Soviet era, state atheism was enforced, which resulted in all of Nagorno- Karabakh's Churches and Mosques being closed.  Republic of Artsakh  After the collapse of USSR the Nagorno-Karabakh War began, during which most of the local Sunni Azeri population was deported by Armenian forces. The remaining Azeries largely emigrated back to Azerbaijan. Today, most of the Armenian population is Christian and belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church which is an Oriental Orthodox Church.

He was son of Mahmud II and brother of Malik-Shah III. The Cambridge History of Iran notes that Sultan Muhammad \\"tried energetically to restore the slipping authority of his dynasty in Iraq,\\"  Biography  He was raised in Fars along with his brother Malik-Shah III. In 1148, their uncle Sultan Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud, who had no heirs and was in a weak position, appointed Malik-Shah III as heir, and gave his daughter in marriage to him. On 13 September 1152, Mas'ud died at Hamadan, and Malik-Shah III ascended the throne. In 1153, Muhammad, who was then in Khuzestan, marched towards Iraq and deposed his brother Malik-Shah III from the Seljuq throne, and ascended the throne himself. Meanwhile, the insurgent Abbasids under caliph al-Muqtafi was seizing the Turks of Iraq, and in 1155 supported a rival claimant to the throne, Suleiman-Shah. Furthermore, al-Muqtafi also sent an army to conquer Jibal, but the army was defeated by Muhammad. In 1157, Muhammad marched to the Abbasid capital of Baghdad with an army of 30,000 men, while his ally the Zangid Qutb ad-Din Mawdud marched from Mosul to capture the Caliphate's provinces in Central Iraq. On January 12, Muhammad reached the walls of western Baghdad. In response the Caliph gathered all his troops from Hillah and Wasit to defend the capital. In February, unable to defend western Baghdad, the caliph abandoned the western side and ordered all the bridges over the Tigris river, which separates the western side of Baghdad from its eastern side, to be destroyed. Muhammad crossed to the western side and easily captured it, and established his camp while at the same time the caliph fortified the walls of eastern Baghdad. Several catapults and ballistas were installed on the city's walls. The caliph also armed the natives of Baghdad by giving them armour and weapons, and incited them to fight the enemy of the caliphate, whom he called infidels since they waged war against the caliph, the successor of the prophet and the leader of the ummah. He also ordered his vizier Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra to give 5 golden dinars to every wounded soldier. On March 4, Sultan Muhammad and his ally Zayn ad-Din, Qutb ad-Din's vizier, attacked eastern Baghdad and bombarded the city. The army of Baghdad repulsed the attack thanks to the courage of the natives of Baghdad and the naffatuns. On March 29, the Seljuks repaired one of the bridges and crossed to the eastern side of the city, where they skirmished with both the Caliph's army and the native militias of Baghdad. The naffatuns destroyed several catapults. The Seljuks tried to breach the gate by a battering ram but it was destroyed by the catapults on the walls. The result of the battle remained indecisive for both sides. On June 29, Sultan Muhammad ordered his men to climb the walls. He had already made 400 ladders to climb the walls of Baghdad, but the assault was repulsed due to the heavy fire and casualties. In the meantime Nur ad-Din Zangi blamed his brother Qutb ad-Din for attacking the caliph's realm, which destroyed the Zengid-Seljuq alliance. Zayn ad-Din lifted the siege and returned to Mosul. Muhammad also was forced to lift the siege after his men informed him that his brother Malik-Shah III has captured Hamadan. He eventually realized that the siege was useless, so he preferred to fight for his throne. Thus the Siege of Baghdad came to end on the July 13 1157. Muhammad shortly managed to repel Malik-Shah III, but became sick during this period, and eventually died in 1159 at Hamadan. The powerful amir of Ray, Ïnanch Sonqur, then put Suleiman-Shah on the Seljuq throne.

This period saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had been created in the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, led to the creation of a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church. In 1743, the Cameronians established themselves as the Reformed Presbyterian Church, remaining largely separate from religious and political debate. Of independent churches from England that were established in the seventeenth century only the Quakers managed to endure in to the eighteenth century. Baptist chapels were re-established in the middle of the century and, although Scotland initially appeared fertile ground for Methodism, it failed to expand as quickly as elsewhere in the Great Britain and Ireland. A number of minor Scottish sects developed, such as the Bereans, Buchanites, Daleites and Glassites. Episcopalianism had retained supporters through the civil wars and changes of regime in the seventeenth century. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions in the first half of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits. The Kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people, with a major role in the Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation the singing of the psalms. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second half of the century there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, with musical accompaniment prohibited. Church of Scotland William Robertson, Principal of the University of Edinburgh and leading figure in the Moderate Party The religious settlement after the Glorious Revolution of 1688/9 adopted the legal forms of 1592, which instituted a fully Presbyterian kirk, and doctrine based on the 1646 Westminster Confession of Faith.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 298–9. The early eighteenth century saw the growth of \\"praying societies\\", who supplemented the services of the established kirk with communal devotions. These often had the approval of parish ministers and their members were generally drawn from the lower ranks of local society. Their outlook varied but they disliked preaching that simply emphasised the Law or that understood the gospel as a new law neonomianism, or that was mere morality, and sought out a gospel that stressed the Grace of God in the sense set out in the Confession of Faith. They often disliked the role of lay patronage in the kirk.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 300. The theological division between neonomian and antineonomian tendencies in the kirk were highlighted by the Marrow Controversy. The Marrow of Modern Divinity was a mid-seventeenth century book with an antineonomian perspective that was reprinted in 1718 and promoted by Thomas Boston (1676–1732) and others. The book was condemned by the General Assembly, giving it widespread publicity. The decision was appealed by 12 \\"Marrow Men\\", but the repudiation was upheld in 1722 and although its supporters were not expelled, they were denied advancement and the controversy continued.D. Hart, Calvinism: A History (Yale University Press, 2013), . There were growing divisions between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. While Evangelicals emphasised the authority of the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established hierarchy of the kirk and attempted to raise the social status of the clergy.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 303–4. From the 1760s the Moderates gained an ascendancy in the General Assembly of the Church. They were led by the historian William Robertson (1721–93), who became principal of the University of Edinburgh and then by his successor George Hill (1750–1819), who was professor at the University of Aberdeen. Evangelical leaders included John Willison (1680–1750), John McLaurin (1693–1754) and Alexander Webster (1707–84). The most important figure was John Erskine (1721–1803), who was minister of Old Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh from 1768 and for 26 years a friend and colleague to Robertson. He was orthodox in doctrine, but sympathised with the Enlightenment and supported reforms in religious practice. A popular preacher, he corresponded with religious leaders in other countries, including New England theologian Johnathan Edwards (1703–58), whose ideas were a major influence on the movement in Scotland.D. W. Bebbington, \\"Religious life: 6 Evangelism\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 515–16. Judged by the number of books printed in Scotland, Boston was the most popular theological writer in the movement.J. Yeager, Enlightened Evangelicalism: The Life and Thought of John Erskine (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 49–50. Secession Ebenezer Erskine, the leading figure of the First Secessionist Church The eighteenth century saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party over fears of fanaticism by the former and the acceptance of Enlightenment ideas by the latter.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1–5 (London: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 416–7. Ecclesiastical patronage, the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint ministers to a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the Patronage Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk. The First Secession was over the right to appoint in cases where a patron made no effort to fill a vacancy. The result was that a group of four ministers, led by Ebenezer Erskine, the minister of Stirling, formed a distinct \\"Associate Presbytery\\" in 1733, but were not forced from the kirk until 1740. This movement was initially very small, but was petitioned by the praying societies with requests for preaching, leading to rapid growth.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 399. Although its founding ministers were from Perthshire and Fife, the forty congregations they had established by 1740 were widely spread across the country, mainly among the middle classes of major towns. The Secessionists soon split among themselves over the issue of the burgess oath, which was administered after the 1745 rebellion as an anti-Jacobite measure, but which implied that the Church of Scotland was the only true church. The \\"burghers\\", led by Erskine, maintained that the oath could be taken, but they were excommunicated by an \\"anti-burgher\\" faction, led by Andrew Gibb, who established a separate General Associate Synod.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 302. In the 1790s the Seceders became embroiled in the Old and New Light controversy. The \\"Old Lichts\\" continued to follow the principles of the Covenanters, while the \\"New Lichts\\" were more focused on personal salvation, considered the strictures of the Covenants as less binding and that a connection of the church and the state was not warranted. The second break from the kirk was also prompted by issues of patronage. Minister Thomas Gillespie (1708–74) was deposed by the General Assembly in 1752 after he refused to participate in inducting a minister to the Inverkeithing parish, since the parishioners opposed the appointment. Gillespie was joined by two other ministers and they held the first meeting of the Presbytery of Relief at Colinsburgh in Fife in 1761. While evangelical in doctrine, the Relief Church did not maintain that it was the only true church, but stated that it was still in communion with the kirk and maintained contact with Episcopalians and Independents.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 400. Like the Associate Presbytery, the movement was initially small, but benefited from the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century, which helped it expand rapidly.G. M. Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival (London: Routledge, 1998), , p. 91. Episcopalianism John Paterson, the last bishop of Glasgow and a non-juror Episcopalianism had retained supporters through the civil wars and regime changes in the seventeenth century. Although the bishops had been abolished in the settlement that followed the Glorious Revolution, becoming \\"non-jurors\\", not subscribing to the right of William III and Mary II to be monarchs, they continued to consecrate Episcopalian clergy. Many clergy were \\"outed\\" from their livings, but the king had issued two acts of indulgence in 1693 and 1695, allowing those who accepted him as king to retain their livings and around a hundred took advantage of the offer.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 252–3. New \\"meeting houses\\" sprang up for those who continued to follow the episcopalian clergy. They generally prospered under Queen Anne and all but the hardened Jacobites would be given toleration in 1712.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 252–3 and 298-9. Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellion in 1715, they suffered a decline in fortunes. A number of the clergy were deprived and in 1719 all meeting houses where prayers were not offered for King George were closed. In 1720, the last surviving bishop died and another was appointed as \\"primus\\", without any particular episcopal see. After the Jacobite rising of 1745, there was another round of restrictions under the Toleration Act of 1746 and Penal Act of 1748, and the number of clergy and congregations declined. The church was sustained by the important nobles and gentlemen in its ranks. This period saw the establishment of Qualified Chapels, where worship was conducted according to the English Book of Common Prayer and where congregations, led by priests ordained by Bishops of the Church of England or the Church of Ireland, were willing to pray for the Hanoverians.N. Yates, Eighteenth-Century Britain: Religion and Politics 1714–1815 (London: Pearson Education, 2008), , p. 49. Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause. These two forms of episcopalianism existed side by side until 1788 when the Jacobite claimant Charles Edward Stuart died in exile. Unwilling to recognise his brother Henry Benedict Stuart, who was a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, as his heir, the non-juror Episcopalians elected to recognise the House of Hanover and offer allegiance to George III. At the repeal of the penal laws in 1792 there were twenty-four Qualified Chapels in Scotland.D. Bertie, ed., Scottish Episcopal Clergy, 1689–2000 (London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2000), , p. 649. Cameronians The Society People, known after one of their leaders as the Cameronians, who had not accepted the restoration of episcopacy in 1660, remained outside of the established kirk after the Revolution settlement, refusing to rejoin an \\"un-Covenanted\\" kirk. However, most of their remaining ministers re-entered the Church of Scotland. After years of persecution their numbers were few and largely confined to the southwest of the country. In the period 1714–43 they had only one minister and were unable to form a presbytery and ordain new clergy. Many joined the Secession Church in order to avoid extinction. In 1743, having obtained the services of a second minister from the Secession Church, they established themselves as the Reformed Presbyterian Church. Roughly 10,000 in number, they remained separate from other denominations and abstained from political involvement, refusing even to vote.C. G. Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997), , pp. 28–9. Independent churches Robert Haldane, who played a major part in expanding independency in Scotland In the mid-seventeenth century, the extension of toleration to sectaries under the Commonwealth brought a number of independent movements to Scotland. The only one not to collapse after the withdrawal of the army at the Restoration in 1660 were the Quakers.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 66. Their numbers remained small in the eighteenth century and they were largely confined to the large cities and the northwest.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, p. 38. Baptist churches had been founded in several towns during the Commonwealth, largely consisting of English soldiers and their families. They lapsed when the English occupation ended and the first Scottish Baptist church is usually thought to be founded at Keiss in 1750 by William Sinclair.W. H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of the Baptists (Scarecrow Press, 2nd edn., 2009), , p. 508. Occasionally individual Presbyterian ministers led their congregations out of existing churches and into independent churches, leading to the establishment of isolated churches for groups like the Unitarians. The series of evangelical enterprises undertaken by the brothers James and Robert Haldane in the period 1796–1800, which led to the foundation of Sunday schools, day schools and tabernacles in parts of the Lowlands, Highlands and Islands, helped strengthen the Baptist and Congregational churches when the brothers later embraced adult Baptism and the congregations divided between the two traditions.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 29–30. Scotland appeared to be fertile ground for Methodism in the 1740s and 1750s, when visits from figures such as John Wesley and George Whitfield attracted large audiences of presbyterians. Methodist societies were established in textile and fishing villages, particularly in Shetland, where Methodism was to enjoy its greatest relative popularity. Most members were to be in the large cities, with Glasgow and Airdrie accounting for 43 per cent of all members in 1819. However, in the 1760s the growth of the movement did not keep pace with that elsewhere in the United Kingdom, with an average annual increase of only 0.2 per cent, compared with 5, nearly 6 and nearly 8 per cent in England, Wales and Ireland respectively. The reasons for the relative failure of Methodism in Scotland have been debated by historians. The Scots preferred an ordained clergy, rather than the lay preachers common elsewhere, and when Wesley granted this concession in 1785 membership doubled in four years, but it was rescinded after this death in 1791 and adherence reduced. The middle classes may also have seen the lay positions in the church as not carrying the same status as did offices like that of elder within the presbyterian churches. Allan MacLaren has argued that the doctrinal Arminianism of Methodism conflicted with the dominant Calvinism of Scotland. The place that Methodism occupied elsewhere in the kingdom may also have been taken by the Secession and Relief churches, the last of which were seen as \\"Scots Methodists\\".Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 25 and 36-7. Minor sects David Dale, founder of the Old Scottish Independents As well as the series of secessionist movements, the eighteenth century saw the formation of a number of minor sects. These included the Glasites, formed by Church of Scotland minister John Glas, who was expelled from his parish of Tealing in 1730 for his objections to the state's intervention in the affairs of the kirk. He advocated a strong form of biblical literalism. With his son-in-law Robert Sandeman, from whose name they are known as the Sandemanians, he founded a number of churches in Scotland and the sect expanded to England and the United States.L. Cohn-Sherbok, Who's Who in Christianity (London: Taylor & Francis, 2013), , p. 107. Closely involved with the Glasites were the followers of industrialist David Dale who broke with the kirk in the 1760s and formed the Old Scotch Independents, sometimes known as the Daleists. He preached a combination of industry and faith that led him to co-found the cotton-mill at New Lanark and to contribute to the Utopian Socialism associated with his son- in-law Robert Owen.J. Wormald, Scotland : A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), . The Bereans were formed by John Barclay in Edinburgh in 1773. Barclay was one of the most prominent followers of moral philosopher Archibald Campbell and espoused a rigorous form of pre-destination and insisted on Biblical-based preaching. Having been rejected from various pastorships and by the General Assembly, he founded independent churches in Scotland and then in England, taking the name Bereans from the people mentioned in Acts 17:11. After Barclay's death in 1798 his followers joined the congregationalists.W. H. Brackney, Historical Dictionary of Radical Christianity (Plymouth: Scarecrow Press, 2012), , p. 52. The Buchanites were a Millenarian cult that broke away from the Relief Church when Hugh White, minister at Irvine, declared Elspeth Buchan to be a special saint identified with the woman described in Revelation 12. They attracted less than fifty followers and having been expelled by local magistrates they formed a community at a farm known as New Cample in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The sect collapsed after the death of Buchan in 1791.J. F. C. Harrison, The Second Coming: Popular Millenarianism 1780–1850 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1979), , p. 33. Other minor sects include the McMillanites, reported as a group of Covernanters who had separated from kirk discipline in Dumfrisshire in 1721. Another group in the same area, called the Hebronites, were alleged to have sworn at a minister. The Hebronites were later absorbed into the Secession Church with other Covenanters after 1736.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, p. 16. Catholicism Lord George Gordon, who led the campaign that defeated the implementation of the First Relief Act of 1778 to Scotland and lent his name to the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots By the eighteenth century, Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Numbers probably reduced in the seventeenth century and organisation had deteriorated. Pope Innocent X appointed Thomas Nicolson as the first Vicar Apostolic over the mission in 1694.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 365. The country was organised into districts and by 1703 there were thirty-three Catholic clergy. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. In 1732, it was divided into two vicariates, one for the Highlands and one for the Lowlands, each under a bishop. There were six attempts to found a seminary in the Highlands between 1732 and 1838, all of which floundered on financial issues. Clergy entered the country secretly and although services were illegal they were maintained. In 1755, it was estimated that there were only 16,500 communicants, mainly in the north and west, although the number is probably an underestimate. By the end of the century this had probably fallen by a quarter due to emigration. The First Relief Act of 1778, was designed to bring a measure of toleration to Catholics, but a campaign led by Lord George Gordon, that resulted anti- Catholic riots in Scotland, known after him as the Gordon Riots, meant that it was limited to England.J. Black, The Politics of Britain: 1688–1800 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1993), , p. 61. The provisions of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791, which allowed freedom of worship for Catholics who took an oath of allegiance, were extended to Scotland in 1793.T. Gallagher, Glasgow: The Uneasy Peace : Religious Tension in Modern Scotland, 1819–1914 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987), , p. 9. In 1799, the Lowland District seminary was transferred to Aquhorthies, near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire, so that it could serve the entire country. It was secretly funded by the government, who were concerned at the scale of emigration by Highland Catholics. Protestant missions Long after the triumph of the Church of Scotland in the Lowlands, Highlanders and Islanders clung to a form of Christianity infused with animistic folk beliefs and practices.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, p. 85. The remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined missionary efforts. The Scottish Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was founded by Royal Charter in 1708. Its aim was partly religious and partly cultural, intending to \\"wear out\\" Gaelic and \\"learn the people the English tongue\\". By 1715, it was running 25 schools, by 1755 it was 116 and by 1792 it was 149, but most were on the edges of the Highlands. The difficulty of promoting Protestantism and English in a Gaelic speaking region, eventually led to a change of policy in the SSPCK and in 1754 it sanctioned the printing of a Bible with Gaelic and English text on facing pages. The government only began to seriously promote Protestantism from 1725, when it began to make a grant to the General Assembly known as the Royal Bounty. Part of this went towards itinerant ministers, but by 1764 there were only ten. Probably more significant for the spread of Protestantism were the lay catechists, who met the people on the Sabbath, read Scripture, and joined them in Psalms and prayers. They would later be important in the Evangelical revival.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 364. Evangelical Revival George Whitefield preaching at Cambuslang in 1742 From the later 1730s Scotland experienced a version of the Evangelical revival that also affected England and Wales and North America. Protestant congregations, usually in a specific locations, experienced intense \\"awakenings\\" of enthusiasm, renewed commitment and, sometimes, rapid expansion. This was first seen at Easter Ross in the Highlands in 1739 and most famously in the Cambuslang Wark (work) near Glasgow in 1742, where intense religious activity culminated in a crowd of perhaps 30,000 gathering there to hear English preacher George Whitefield.D. Bebbington, Victorian Religious Revivals: Culture and Piety in Local and Global Contexts (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 5. Scotland was also visited 22 times by John Wesley, the English evangelist and founder of Methodism, between 1751 and 1790.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, p. 304. Most of the new converts were relatively young and from the lower groups in society, such as small tenants, craftsmen, servants and the unskilled, with a relatively high proportion of unmarried women. This has been seen as a reaction against the oligarchical nature of the established kirk, which was dominated by local lairds and heritors. Unlike awakenings elsewhere, the revival in Scotland did not give rise to a major religious movement, but benefited the secession churches.Ditchfield, The Evangelical Revival, pp. 53 and 91. The revival was particularly significant in the Highlands, where the lack of a clear parochial structure led to a pattern of spiritual enthusiasm, recession and renewal, often instigated by lay catechists, known as \\"the Men\\", who would occasionally emerge as charismatic leaders. The revival left a legacy of strict Sabbatarianism and local identity. From the late eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations associated with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes.Lynch, Scotland: A New History, p. 403. Because the revival occurred at the same time as the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals taking control of the General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers. Popular religion The Black Stool by David Allan (1744–96). A young bachelor is accused of fornication. At the beginning of the century, the kirk had considerable control over the lives of the people. It had a major role in the Poor Law and schools, which were administered through the parishes, and over the morals of the population, particularly over sexual offences such as adultery and fornication. A rebuke was necessary for moral offenders to \\"purge their scandal\\". This involved standing or sitting before the congregation for up to three Sundays and enduring a rant by the minister. There was sometimes a special repentance stool near the pulpit for this purpose. In a few places the subject was expected to wear sackcloth. From the 1770s kirk session increasingly administered private rebukes, particularly for men from the social elites, while until the 1820s the poor were almost always give a public rebuke.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, p. 72. In the early part of the century the kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, attempted to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which secular tunes were played.J. Porter, \\"Introduction\\" in J. Porter, ed., Defining Strains: The Musical Life of Scots in the Seventeenth Century (Peter Lang, 2007), , p. 22. The oppression of secular music and dancing by the kirk began to ease between about 1715 and 1725.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 193–4. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterian culture. For members of separatist churches, the Sunday walk to the meeting house, sometimes as much as thirty miles, marked the intensity of dissent and strict keeping of the Sabbath was a mark of true membership. Fast days were also important, particularly in Seeder culture. They often did not involve actual fasting, but focused on stricter observance of the Sabbath. The established kirk had three a year, but the seeders as many as six.Brown, Religion and Society in Scotland Since 1707, pp. 79–80. In Presbyterian worship the sermon, which could be several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that services tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in the singing of the psalms.D. Murray, \\"Religious life: 1650–1750\\" in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 513–4. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line and it was then repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza.B. D. Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780: Liturgies and Sermons (Scarecrow Press, 2009), , pp. 143–4. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.Spinks, A Communion Sunday in Scotland ca. 1780, p. 26. A Scottish communion token from 1750 Among Presbyterians, communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them to take part in the ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark. Among Episcopalians, Qualified Chapels used the English Book of Common Prayer. They installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non- jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. When the two branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.R. M. Wilson, Anglican Chant and Chanting in England, Scotland, and America, 1660 to 1820 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), , p. 192. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, usually in the private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.N. Yates, Preaching, Word and Sacrament: Scottish Church Interiors 1560–1860 (A&C; Black, 2009), , p. 94. References Notes Bibliography * Bebbington, D. W., \\"Religious life: 6 Evangelism\\" in M.

Besides these properties of light, the phase-amplitude aspects have intrinsic quantum fluctuations that are of central interest in quantum optics. In ordinary laser spectroscopy,Stenholm, S. (2005).

In quantum-optical spectroscopy, one additionally utilizes the quantum-optical fluctuations of light to enhance the spectroscopic capabilities by directly shaping and/or detecting the quantum fluctuations of light. Quantum-optical spectroscopy has applications in controlling and characterizing quantum dynamics of many-body states because one can directly access a large set of many-body states,Kira, M.; Koch, S.

Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. . which is not possible in classical spectroscopy . Quantum-optical state injection A generic electromagnetic field can always be expressed in terms of a mode expansion where individual components form a complete set of modes. Such modes can be constructed with different methods and they can, e.g., be energy eigenstate, generic spatial modes, or temporal modes. Once these light mode are chosen, their effect on the quantized electromagnetic field can be described by Boson creation and annihilation operators \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger and \\\\hat{B} for photons, respectively.Walls, D. F.; Milburn, G. J. (2008). Quantum Optics. Springer. . The quantum fluctuations of the light field can be uniquely definedKira, M.; Koch, S. (2008). \\"Cluster-expansion representation in quantum optics\\". Physical Review A 78 (2). doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.78.022102. . by the photon correlations \\\\Delta\\\\langle\\\\left [ B^ {\\\\dagger}\\\\right]^J\\\\, B^K\\\\rangle that contain the pure (J+K)-particle correlations as defined with the cluster-expansion approach. Using the same second-quantization formalism for the matter being studied, typical electronic excitations in matter can be described by Fermion operators for electronic excitations and holes, i.e.~electronic vacancies left behind to the many-body ground state.Ashcroft, N. W.; Mermin, N. D. (1976). Solid state physics. Saunders College. . The corresponding electron–hole excitations can be described by operators \\\\hat{X}^\\\\dagger and \\\\hat{X} that create and annihilate an electron–hole pair, respectively. In several relevant cases, the light–matter interaction can be described using the dipole interaction \\\\hat{H}_{\\\\mathrm{lm}}=-\\\\sum\\\\mathcal{F}\\\\,\\\\hat{B}\\\\hat{X}^{\\\\dagger}+\\\\mathrm{h.c.}\\\\,, where the summation is implicitly taken over all possibilities to create an electron–hole pair (the \\\\hat{X}^\\\\dagger part) via a photon absorption (the \\\\hat{B} part); the Hamiltonian also contains the Hermitian conjugate (abbreviated as h.c.) of the terms that are explicitly written. The coupling strength between light and matter is defined by \\\\mathcal{F}. When the electron–hole pairs are excited resonantly with a single-mode light \\\\hat{B}, the photon correlations are directly injected into the many-body correlations. More specifically, the fundamental form of the light–matter interaction inevitably leads to a correlation-transfer relation \\\\Delta\\\\langle\\\\left[\\\\hat{X}^{\\\\dagger}\\\\right]^J\\\\hat{X}^K\\\\rangle=\\\\eta^{\\\\frac{J+K}{2}} \\\\Delta\\\\langle\\\\left [ B^ { \\\\dagger }\\\\right]^JB^K\\\\rangle\\\\,, between photons and electron–hole excitations. Strictly speaking, this relation is valid before the onset of scattering induced by the Coulomb and phonon interactions in the solid. Therefore, it is desirable to use laser pulses that are faster than the dominant scattering processes. This regime is relatively easy to realize in present-day laser spectroscopy because lasers can already output femtosecond, or even attosecond, pulses with a high precision in controllability. Realization Physically, the correlation-transfer relation means that one can directly inject desired many-body states simply by adjusting the quantum fluctuations of the light pulse, as long as the light pulse is short enough. This opens a new possibility for studying properties of distinct many-body states, once the quantum-optical spectroscopy is realized through controlling the quantum fluctuations of light sources. For example, a coherent-state laser is described entirely by its single-particle expectation value \\\\langle \\\\hat{B} \\\\rangle. Therefore, such excitation directly injects property \\\\langle \\\\hat{X} \\\\rangle that is polarization related to electron–hole transitions. To directly excite bound electron–hole pairs, i.e., excitons, described by a two-particle correlation \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{X}^\\\\dagger \\\\hat{X} \\\\rangle, or a biexciton transition \\\\Delta \\\\langle \\\\hat{X}\\\\, \\\\hat{X} \\\\rangle, one needs to have a source with \\\\Delta\\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger \\\\hat{B} \\\\rangle or \\\\Delta \\\\langle \\\\hat{B} \\\\hat{B} \\\\rangle photon correlations, respectively. To realize quantum- optical spectroscopy, high-intensity light sources with freely adjustable quantum statistics are needed which are currently not available. However, one can apply projective methodsSudarshan, E. (1963). \\"Equivalence of Semiclassical and Quantum Mechanical Descriptions of Statistical Light Beams\\".

Especially, the method presented in Ref. is robust in projecting quantum- optical responses of genuine many-body systems. This work has shown that one can indeed reveal and access many–body properties that remain hidden in classical spectroscopy. Therefore, the quantum-optical spectroscopy is ideally suited for characterizing and controlling complicated many-body states in several different systems, ranging from molecules to semiconductors. Relation to semiconductor quantum optics Quantum-optical spectroscopy is an important approach in general semiconductor quantum optics. The capability to discriminate and control many-body states is certainly interesting in extended semiconductors such as quantum wells because a typical classical excitation indiscriminately detects contributions from multiple many-body configurations; With quantum-optical spectroscopy one can access and control a desired many-body state within an extended semiconductor. At the same time, the ideas of quantum-optical spectroscopy can also be useful when studying simpler systems such as quantum dots. Quantum dots are a semiconductor equivalent to simple atomic systems where most of the first quantum-optical demonstrations have been measured. Since quantum dots are man-made, one can possibly customize them to produce new quantum-optical components for information technology. For example, in quantum-information science, one is often interested to have light sources that can output photons on demand or entangled photon pairs at specific frequencies. Such sources have already been demonstrated with quantum dots by controlling their photon emission with various schemes.Michler, P. (2000). \\"A Quantum Dot Single-Photon Turnstile Device\\".

It was first discovered at Tsumeb, approved by the International Mineralogical Association as a new mineral species in 2011, reference IMA2011-49, and named for Ian Bruce,http://crystalclassics.co.uk/page.php?id=3> who founded \\"Crystal Classics\\" in the early 1990s, and was heavily involved in attempts to reopen the famous Tsumeb mine for specimen mining. In 2013 new occurrences of ianbruceite were reported from the neighbouring Driggith and Potts Gill mines on High Pike in the Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, England. Here the mineral is probably a post-mining product. Caldbeck Fells and Tsumeb are the only reported localities for ianbruceite to date (May 2013).  Structure  There are four formula units per unit cell (Z = 4). Unit cell parameters are the lengths of the sides of the unit cell, a, b and c, and the angle β between the a and c crystal axes. For ianbruceite a = 11.793 Å, b = 9.1138 Å, c = 6.8265 Å, and β = 103.859°. It belongs in the monoclinic, prismatic crystal Class 2/m, with space group P21/c. Ianbruceite consists of layers with composition [Zn2(OH)(H2O)(AsO4)] alternating with an inter-layer space containing loosely bound water molecules. The arsenic is tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygen anions.  Appearance  Ianbruceite occurs as aggregates of tiny, radiating, lath-like crystals with a distinctive diamond-shaped outline, up to 0.2 mm across. Material from Tsumeb is blue, ranging from a very pale color to deep blue. Material from the Caldbeck Fells is white to pale pink. The crystals have a vitreous luster and a white streak.  Optical properties  The refractive indices of ianbruceite are similar to that of ordinary window glass, with nα = 1.601, nβ = 1.660 and nγ = 1.662. The refractive index varies with the wavelength (color) of light, so the positions of the optic axes in biaxial crystals, and the angle 2V between them, will change when the color of the incident light is changed. This effect may be expressed in the form r > v, indicating that the angle 2V is greater for red than for violet light, or vice versa.Klein and Hurlbut (1993) Manual of Mineralogy 21st Edition. Wiley For ianbruceite 2V is greater for violet light than for red light, v > r. The angle 2V has been measured as 18°; it can also be calculated from the values of the refractive indices α, β and γ, giving a value of 20°. The mineral does not fluoresce in ultraviolet light.  Physical properties  Cleavage is perfect parallel to (100). Crystals of ianbruceite are flexible and deform plastically. The mineral is very soft, with Mohs hardness only 1, the same as talc. Measurements of the specific gravity have not been reported, but from the formula and the cell dimensions it has been calculated as 3.197. It is insoluble in dilute acid, which distinguishes it from hydrozincite and aragonite, which are also supergene minerals that form white crusts. The loosely bound water between the layers is easily lost, so the mineral may effloresce. It also readily absorbs alcohol.  Occurrence  The type locality is the Tsumeb Mine, Otjikoto Region, Namibia. Type material is conserved in the Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, catalogue number M53150. At localities in the Caldbeck Fells ianbruceite occurs as a late-stage supergene mineral in fractures in partly oxidised sulfide-rich carbonate or quartz-carbonate matrix. The mines of Caldbeck Fells are famous for their supergene minerals. Driggith and Potts Gill Mines worked low temperature lead-zinc-copper veins on the eastern and northern slopes of High Pike. Arsenopyrite is abundant there, and its oxidation in veins that also contain primary lead, zinc and copper sulfides has produced a range of supergene arsenates. At the Driggith Mine, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, on dumps from the 30 fathom level, radiating aggregates of lath-like crystals of ianbruceite have been found in fractures in quartz- dolomite matrix with sphalerite, chalcopyrite and cobalt-bearing köttigite as rounded pink aggregates, or more rarely pale pink to colorless monoclinic blades, as well as irregular black patches of a cobalt-bearing manganese oxide, adamite and an unidentified copper silicate. At the nearby Potts Gill Mine, Caldbeck Fells, Cumbria, on dumps from the Endeavor level, it has been found as minute, pearly, lath-like crystals in fractures in arsenopyrite-rich dolomite. One block of material contained abundant marcasite, galena, sphalerite and minor fine-grained arsenopyrite, in dolomitic matrix. In Namibia ianbruceite has been found in the zinc pocket at the 44 Level, Tsumeb Mine, as sky blue to very pale blue platy crystals associated with leiteite, köttigite, legrandite and adamite. It occurs as thin platy crystals up to 80 μm long and a few μm thick, which form flattened aggregates up to 0.10 mm across, and ellipsoidal aggregates up to 0.5 mm across, associated with coarse white leiteite, dark blue köttigite, minor legrandite and adamite.

The film was selected as the Croatian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot In 1977, fifteen years before the Bosnian War ravaged their lives, Halima's (Alma Prica) niece Safija (Olga Pakalović) became pregnant by Slavomir (Mijo Jurišić), a Serb man. Beaten and ostracized by her Bosniak family, Safija gave the infant boy to the childless Halima to raise, telling Slavomir it was stillborn. Twenty-three years later, the devastating war has ended. Bodies are being identified through DNA samples and returned to families for burial. Halima's husband is found, but Mirza's bones cannot be returned to her without a blood sample. And that would have to come from Safija who ran away years ago and married Slavomir. When Halima finally locates her, Safija refuses the blood test because she is afraid her husband will discover her deception.

It took them 12 years to find their son's biological mother who kept refusing to give her blood for the DNA identification of Emir's remains. They found that Emir's biological mother was residing in Zagreb, Croatia. Emir's biological sister resides in Vitez, Bosnia, and, unlike their mother, was completely willing to give her blood for the DNA test, should Emir's bones be found. Zahida Fazlić died in May 2011. Production Feđa Isović wrote the first draft of the script in the middle of the 2000s decade, for his friend Benjamin Filipović, with whom he had previously worked with on the black comedy Dobro uštimani mrtvaci (Well-Tempered Corpses) in 2005. After Filipović's death on 20 July 2006, the script was handed over to Croatian director Arsen Anton Ostojić, who directed the final version of the film. Filming began on 27 February 2012 in Pisarovina. The movie is available with English or French subtitles. Releases and screenings The film was first shown at the 59th Pula Film Festival in July 2012. It had its official release on 18 October 2012 in the Bosnian cities of Sarajevo, Mostar, Zenica and Banja Luka, followed by its premiere in Zagreb, Croatia on 23 October 2012 and wide release on 25 October.

This optical gain is due to stimulated emission associated with light emission created by recombination of electrons and holes. While in other laser materials like in gas lasers or solid state lasers, the processes associated with optical gain are rather simple, in semiconductors this is a complex many-body problem of interacting photons, electrons, and holes. Accordingly, understanding these processes is a major objective as being a basic requirement for device optimization. This task can be solved by development of appropriate theoretical models to describe the semiconductor optical gain and by comparison of the predictions of these models with experimental results found. Theory for optical gain in semiconductors Since defining semiconductor's optical gain is an ambitious undertaking, it is useful to build the understanding by steps. The basic requirements can be defined without the major complications induced by the Coulomb interaction among electrons and holes. To explain the actual operation of semiconductor lasers, one must refine this analysis by systematically including the Coulomb-interaction effects. Free-carrier picture For a simple, qualitative understanding of optical gain and its spectral dependency, often so-called free-carrier models are used which is discussed considering the example of a bulk laser here. The term free carrier means that any interactions between the carriers are neglected. A free-carrier model provides the following expression for the spectral dependence g(\\\\varepsilon) Chow, W. W.; Koch, S. W.; Sargent, M. (1994). Semiconductor-laser physics. Springer- Verlag. . Chow, W. W.; Koch, S. W. (27 August 1999). Semiconductor-Laser Fundamentals: Physics of the Gain Materials. Springer. . : g(\\\\varepsilon) = g_0 \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\, [f^{\\\\mathrm{e}}(\\\\varepsilon) + f^{\\\\mathrm{h}}(\\\\varepsilon) - 1] ~, with the reduced-mass energy \\\\varepsilon, the quasi-Fermi-distribution functions for the conduction-band f^{\\\\mathrm{e}} and for the valence-band f^{\\\\mathrm{h}}, respectively, and with g_0 given by: : g_{0}(\\\\varepsilon) = \\\\frac{ u \\\\mu(\\\\varepsilon)^2}{4 \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\pi n} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2 m_{\\\\mathrm{r}}}{\\\\hbar^2} \\\\right)^{3/2} ~, with u being the frequency, \\\\mu(\\\\varepsilon)^2 the dipole-matrix element, m_{\\\\mathrm{r}} the reduced mass, \\\\varepsilon_0 the vacuum permittivity, and n the refractive index. Thus, the shape of the gain spectrum g(\\\\varepsilon) is determined by the density of states, proportional to \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon}, for bulk material and the quasi-Fermi-distribution functions. This expression gives a qualitative impression of the dependence of the gain spectra on the distribution functions. However, a comparison to experimental data shows immediately that this approach is not at all suited to give quantitative predictions on the exact gain values and the correct shape of the spectra. For that purpose, a microscopic model including many-body interactions is required. In recent years, the microscopic many-body model based on the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE) has been very successful. Ellmers, C.; Girndt, A.; Hofmann, M.; Knorr, A.; Rühle, W.

Microscopic many body gain model The model is based on the SBE describing the dynamics of the microscopic polarizations p_\\\\mathbf{k} between conduction and valence bands, the distribution functions n_\\\\mathbf{k}, and the many-body correlations created by the interactions. If only stationary gain spectra in the linear regime are of interest, one can neglect the time dependence of the distribution functions f^e_\\\\mathbf{k} and f^h_\\\\mathbf{k}, and simply express them by quasi-Fermi- distributions for a given carrier density and temperature. The microscopic polarizations are given by: : \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}}{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}t} p_\\\\mathbf{k} = - \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\, \\\\delta_k p_\\\\mathbf{k} - \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\, [1- f^e_\\\\mathbf{k} - f^h_\\\\mathbf{k} ] \\\\Omega_\\\\mathbf{k} - \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}}{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}t} p_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\right _{\\\\mathrm{coll}} where \\\\delta_\\\\mathbf{k} is the renormalized transition energy between conduction and valence bands and \\\\Omega_\\\\mathbf{k} is the renormalized Rabi frequency. In contrast to the free-carrier description, this model contains contributions due to many-body Coulomb interactions such as \\\\delta_\\\\mathbf{k} and \\\\Omega_\\\\mathbf{k}, and the collision term \\\\left. \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}}{\\\\mathrm{\\\\partial}t} p_\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\right _{\\\\mathrm{coll}} that describes the effect of the correlations which may be treated in different approximations. The easiest approach is to replace the collision term by a phenomenological relaxation rate (T_2-approximation). However, though this approximation is often used, it leads to somewhat unphysical results like absorption below the semiconductor band gap. A more correct but also much more complex approach considers the collision term kinetically and thus contains in- and out-scattering rates for the microscopic polarizations. In this quantum kinetic approach, the calculations require only the basic input parameters (material band structure, geometrical structure, and temperature) and provide the semiconductor gain and refractive index spectra without further free parameters. In detail, the above-mentioned equation of motion of the polarization is solved numerically by calculating the first two terms on the right hand side from the input parameters and by computing the collision contributions. Then, the equation of motion is numerically time-integrated and the microscopic polarizations are summed over \\\\mathbf{k} to obtain the complex macroscopic polarization which then provides the gain and the refractive index spectra in semiconductor laser theory. It should be mentioned that present-day modeling assumes a perfect semiconductor structure in order to reduce the numerical effort. Disorder effects like composition variations or thickness fluctuations of the material are not microscopically considered but such imperfections often occur in real structures. Such contributions to inhomogeneous broadening may be included into the theory by convolution with a Gaussian broadening function for quantitative comparison with experimental data. Experimental determination of the optical gain The predictive quality of microscopic modeling can be verified or disproved by optical-gain measurements. If the design is approved, one may continue to laser production. If experiments exhibit unexpected gain features, one can refine the modeling by including systematically new effects. As more effects are included, the predictive power of the model increases. In general, a closed-loop design, where the modeling and experiment are replaced cyclically, has proven to be a very efficient method to find and develop new laser designs with desired performance. Stripe-length method Various experimental approaches can be used for the determination of the optical gain of semiconductor structures. For example, the optical stripe-length method is widely applied. Hvam, J. M. (1978). \\"Direct recording of optical-gain spectra from ZnO\\". Journal of Applied Physics 49 (6): 3124. . . This method uses a strong laser source for optical excitation of the sample under investigation. The laser beam is focused to a stripe (e.g., with a cylindrical lens) onto the sample such that the stripe covers the sample but extends to one of its edges. Then, the intensity I_{\\\\mathrm{ASE}} of the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of the sample out of this edge is measured as a function of the stripe length l. The gain can then be extracted from an appropriate fit of the I_{\\\\mathrm{ASE}}(l) data. The stripe-length method provides reasonable qualitative results for semiconductor samples which have not yet been processed towards electrically pumped laser structures. More quantitatively accurate results, however, are obtained with other methods that require completely processed laser structures that emit in the fundamental lateral mode only as, for example, the Hakki–Paoli method and the transmission method. Hakki–Paoli method For the Hakki–Paoli method, Hakki, B. W. (1973). \\"cw degradation at 300°K of GaAs double-heterostructure junction lasers. II. Electronic gain\\". Journal of Applied Physics 44 (9): 4113. . . the semiconductor laser has to be operated below the laser threshold. Then, the spectrum of the emitted ASE is strongly governed by the Fabry–Pérot modes of the diode laser resonator. If the length of the device and the reflectivities of the facets are known, the gain can be evaluated from the maxima and the minima of the Fabry–Pérot peaks in the ASE spectrum. This requires, however, that the ASE data are recorded with a spectrometer of sufficient spectral resolution. Then, this method is rather easy and straightforward but it provides gain data only in the regime below the laser threshold while in many cases the gain above the laser threshold would also be of interest, in particular for a quantitative comparison to a theoretical model. Transmission method The transmission method requires a weak broadband light source that spectrally covers the region of interest for the gain spectra. This light source is transmitted through the device of interest and the ratio of the intensities after and before the laser device provides the gain spectra. For this method, the device should operate on the fundamental lateral mode and the occurrence of Fabry–Pérot modes should be suppressed by deposition of at least one antireflection coating on the output facet of the device. In comparison to the stripe-length method and the Hakki–Paoli method, the transmission method provides the most accurate gain data for the widest range of injection currents. The Hakki–Paoli method can be directly compared to calculations within the Semiconductor Bloch equations. Comparison of theory and experiment 500pxthumbnailrightThe figure shows a comparison between experimental gain spectra for a (GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs quantum well ridge waveguide laser structure determined with the transmission method with gain spectra calculated with the microscopic many-body model. The figure shows sets of theoretical and experimental gain spectra for a (GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs quantum- well structure. For the experimental spectra, the injection current was varied while for the theoretical curves different carrier densities were considered. The theoretical spectra were convoluted with a Gaussian function with an inhomogeneous broadening of 19.7 meV. While for the data shown in the figure, the inhomogeneous broadening was adapted for optimum agreement with experiment, it may also unambiguously determined from low-density luminescence spectra of the material under study. Almost perfect quantitative agreement of theoretical and experimental gain spectra can be obtained considering that the device heats up slightly in the experiment at higher injection currents. Thus, the temperature is increased for the gain spectra at higher carrier densities. Note that apart from that, there were no free fitting parameters entering the theory. Accordingly, once the material parameters are known, the microscopic many-body model provides an accurate prediction of the optical gain spectra of any new semiconductor material as, for example, (GaIn)(NAs)/GaAs or Ga(NAsP)/Si.

Born in the province of Lodi (but for Guicciardini he is allegedly from Parma), Fanfulla almost certainly died 24 February 1525 in the battle of Pavia. He had at least four children (Marc’Antonio, Ambrosio, Giorgio and Domenico) and nine grandchildren. He was first a soldier of fortune, then knight and finally captain of a flag between 1499 and 1525. They say of him: In his life he fought on the side of Florence (1499), Spain (from 1503) and empire (from 1515) having as enemies Pisa (in 1499) and France (from 1503 onwards). Together with Ettore Fieramosca he was the main character of the famous battle of Barletta, which on 13 February 1503 saw thirteen Italian warriors fight against the same number of Frenchmen. Having remained horseless (together with Giovanni Bracalone) during the fight, he fought on foot killing the horses of the French jousters. At the end of the battle, he was knighted by the Spanish potestà (chief magistrate) Consalvo di Cordoba. He is one of the main characters of the novel Ettore Fieramosca o La disfida di BarlettaEttore Fieramosca o La disfida di Barletta (1833), by the politician and man of letters Massimo d'Azeglio, in which the author's phantasy introduces him as an astute, fun and jolly man. The resulting colourful portrait of heroic soldier of fortune gave Fanfulla his fame. Fanfulla is considered one of the symbols of the town of Lodi and of its territory, so much so that a number of local sports clubs take inspiration from his figure: among the most awarded there is the A.S.Ginnastica e Scherma Fanfulla 1874,official website A.S.Ginnastica e Scherma Fanfulla 1874 l'Atletica FanfullaN.A. Fanfulla Lodigiana and the Associazione Calcio Fanfulla 1874. Moreover, the biscuits Amaretti Fanfullini, a typical product of Lodi, owe their name to him. A famous Italian goliardic song from the 20th century has been also dedicated to Fanfulla: Fanfulla da Lodi. In the city of Lecce, bronze statue of him by the Italian sculptor Antonio Bortone from Ruffano is found in the square Raimondello Orsini. Battles he took part in He took part in all the main battles of the 16th century. Always giving proof of his great courage he travelled throughout Italy taking part in: *the siege of Pisa of 1499 (at the side of Paolo Vitelli), *the battle of Cerignola of 1503 (at the service of the Duke of Termoli), *the challenge of Barletta of 13 February 1503, *the battle of Ravenna (1512) (in which he was made prisoner), *the battle of Villafranca (1515), *probably also the battle of Pavia of 24 February 1525 (where it is presumed he died). Famous quotations They have said of him: *\\"The warrior svelto di corpo e bizzarro d'ingegno, il cavaliere di ventura ricco d'ardimento, con qualche macchia forse, but certainly fearless and with an enormous carica enorme di simpatia, true symbol of the human and Italian saper vivere\\" (Massimo D'Azeglio). *\\"Uomo valoroso. Disprezzava ogni pericolo della vita in battaglia\\".Condottieri di ventura *\\"Di animo altero e superbo\\". *\\"Despising any danger in the battle\\" (Paolo Giovio). *\\"Fanfulla is the unpredictable and unexpected side of a Lodi otherwise known as placid and slow-paced; however, there is vitality, it exists, it manifests itself and it certainly does so in the sports field. That little bit or a lot of Fanfulla, swordsman of good fortune, which still resides in us all citizens of Lodi, must push us to revive sport in Lodi\\" (Age Bassi, Lodi fra storia e cronaca, 1919-1945) (Lodi between history and chronicle, 1919-1945). References in popular culture *Comics: he appeared as a comics strip character (drawings by Willy Signoroni and text by Andrea Maietti) in the Italian local daily newspaper il Cittadino in the years 2000. *Music: the Italian goliardic song Fanfulla da Lodi has been dedicated to him; Il barone Fanfulla da Lodi is also a track from the album Polenta violenta (2007) by the lombard heavy metal musician Ul Mik Longobardeath. *Film: in 1940 the film Fanfulla da Lodi was shot, film director Carlo Duse and Giulio Antamoro (with Ennio Cerlesi, Germana Paolieri and Osvaldo Valenti). Another presence of Fanfulla is in Soldier of Fortune, 1976, film director Pasquale Festa Campanile (Gino Pernice is Fanfulla da Lodi). *Theatre: Fanfulla da Lodi has represented an excellent subject for theatre works entitled to him, mainly inspired by the plots of the novels by D'Azeglio.

Biography  Leonardo was the second son and youngest child of Leonardo I Tocco, the Count palatine of the islands of Cephalonia and Zakynthos and lord of Ithaca and Leucas, and his wife, Maddalena dei Buondelmonti. His older siblings were Carlo I Tocco and Petronila wife of Vernier.PLP 29008Talbot (1991), pp. 2090–2091 Leonardo's father died while he was still an infant, and for the next few years, his mother acted as regent for both her sons.Setton & Hazard (1975), p. 302 His brother Carlo I gave the island of Zakynthos to him as an appanage in 1399, and Leonardo also received lands in the Principality of Achaea by Prince Pedro de San Superano.Setton & Hazard (1975), pp. 161, 806 Little is known of him otherwise until ca. 1404–1406, when he took part in Carlo's attacks on the Epirote mainland around Arta. Leonardo's and Carlo's exploits over the next decades are the main subject of the Chronicle of the Tocco. In 1407, Leonardo attacked the new Prince of Achaea, Centurione II Zaccaria, who had seized his fiefs in the Morea in 1404, and conquered Glarentza, the principality's main town.Setton & Hazard (1975), p. 161 In 1411 Carlo took possession of Ioannina in Epirus following the death of the Despot of Epirus Esau de' Buondelmonti; Leonardo too joined his brother there, and in the same summer he conquered and razed the Albanian-held fortress of Lachanokastron. In the next year, however, he was defeated by the Albanians at Kranea near Mesopotamon. In 1413, warfare between the Tocchi and Centurione Zaccaria resumed, and this time the latter prevailed. Leonardo campaigned against Zaccaria in 1413, but in summer 1414, he was sent by Carlo to Corinth, where the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos supervised repairs to the Hexamilion wall. The emperor awarded Leonardo with the high court dignity of megas konostaulos, but enjoined both brothers to seek peace with Zaccaria. The brothers appealed to Venice, and with her mediation concluded three-year truce was agreed which left Glarentza once again under Achaean control.Setton & Hazard (1975), p. 162 Carlo now appointed his brother as governor over the Tocco-ruled islands as well as Acarnania with Vonitsa. On 4 October 1416, Leonardo conquered the town of Rogoi. This was followed soon after by the capture of Arta by his brother, and Leonardo was appointed the city's governor. In 1418, he fought against the attacks of the Ottoman Turks, and visited King Ladislaus of Naples. He died soon after at Zakynthos.  Family  The name and identity of Leonardo's wife is unknown, but he had several children: * Carlo II Tocco, who succeeded his uncle Carlo I * Maddalena Tocco, who in 1429 married the Despot of the Morea (and future last Byzantine emperor), Constantine XI Palaiologos * Angelica Tocco, who married Giacomo de Ariano * Creusa Tocco, who married Centurione II Zaccaria  References   Sources   Category:1370s births Category:1410s deaths Category:Tocco family Category:County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos Category:Despotate of Epirus Category:History of Zakynthos Category:Lords of the Crusader states Category:History of Aetolia-Acarnania Category:14th- century Italian people Category:15th-century Italian people Category:Megaloi konostauloi ","title":"Leonardo II Tocco"},{"id":"39454633","text":":For other orders of a similar name, see Sisters of Bethany.

Recording artist John Bieling, ca. 1914. Biography He was born in New York City, and started work in the 1880s in a stained glass factory. He also sang in vocal groups, and by the early 1890s was a member of the Manhansett (or Manhasset) Quartet, with George J. Gaskin, Joe Riley and Walter Snow. The quartet made its first recordings in 1892 for the United States Phonograph Company in Newark, New Jersey, and also recorded for many other early cylinder recording companies including Columbia and Edison.

His purity of tone led him to be nicknamed \\"The Canary\\".Biography by Uncle Dave Lewis at Allmusic.com. Retrieved 22 May 2013 In 1898, Bieling formed a new vocal group, with Samuel Holland Rous (who performed as S. H. Dudley), Jere Mahoney, and William F. Hooley. Mahoney was soon replaced by John Scantlebury Macdonald, who used the pseudonym Harry Macdonough. They recorded as the Edison Male Quartet for Edison, before taking the name The Haydn Quartet in order to record for other companies. In 1901 they began recording for Victor Records, and had great success over the next decade as one of the premier recording groups of the time. The Haydn Quartet's biggest commercial successes included \\"In the Good Old Summer Time\\" (1903), \\"Bedelia\\" (1904), \\"Sweet Adeline (You're the Flower of My Heart)\\" (1904), \\"How'd You Like To Spoon With Me\\" (with Corinne Morgan, 1906), \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" (with Billy Murray, 1908), \\"Sunbonnet Sue\\" (1908), \\"Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet\\" (1909), and \\"By the Light of the Silv'ry Moon\\" (with Murray, 1910).

Lee\\" (1912).Whitburn, Pop Memories 1890-1954, p.206 However, Bieling's voice began to suffer through overwork, and the requirement on him to make cowboy whoops on some of his records, particularly during a 1910 recording session for Edison which damaged his vocal cords. At the time, many studio takes were required to produce sufficient copies of a recording to satisfy public demand. In mid-1913 Bieling decided to give up singing. Bieling then went to work in Victor Records' sales department. He later left the company and became a dealer in Victrola phonographs. He retired in 1926, and moved to live in Hempstead, Long Island. Later in life, Bieling led gatherings of individuals who had made early phonograph recordings. The gatherings were christened \\"John Bieling Day\\" after his death.

For one electron and one hole, this problem is analogous to the Schrödinger equation of the hydrogen atom; and the bound-state solutions are called excitons. When an exciton's radius extends over several unit cells, it is referred to as a Wannier exciton in contrast to Frenkel excitons whose size is comparable with the unit cell. An excited solid typically contains many electrons and holes; this modifies the Wannier equation considerably. The resulting generalized Wannier equation can be determined from the homogeneous part of the semiconductor Bloch equations or the semiconductor luminescence equations. The equation is named after Gregory Wannier. Background Since an electron and a hole have opposite charges their mutual Coulomb interaction is attractive. The corresponding Schrödinger equation, in relative coordinate \\\\mathbf{r}, has the same form as the hydrogen atom: : \\\\- \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 abla^2}{2\\\\mu} + V(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\right] \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{r}) = E_\\\\lambda \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\,, with the potential given by : V(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\frac{e^2}{4\\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_r \\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\mathbf{r}}\\\\,. Here, \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant, abla is the nabla operator, \\\\mu is the reduced mass, -e (+e) is the elementary charge related to an electron (hole), \\\\varepsilon_r is the relative permittivity, and \\\\varepsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity. The solutions of the hydrogen atom are described by eigenfunction \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{r}) and eigenenergy E_\\\\lambda where \\\\lambda is a quantum number labeling the different states. In a solid, the scaling of E_\\\\lambda and the wavefunction size are orders of magnitude different from the hydrogen problem because the relative permittivity \\\\varepsilon_r is roughly ten and the reduced mass in a solid is much smaller than the electron rest mass m_e, i.e., \\\\mu \\\\ll m_e. As a result, the exciton radius can be large while the exciton binding energy is small, typically few to hundreds of meV, depending on material, compared to eV for the hydrogen problem.Haug, H.; Koch, S. W. (2009). Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors (5th ed.). World Scientific. p. 216. .Klingshirn, C. F. (2006). Semiconductor Optics. Springer. . The Fourier transformed version of the presented Hamiltonian can be written as : E_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\phi_\\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{k}) - \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k'}} V_{\\\\mathbf{k}-\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{k'}) = E_\\\\lambda \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\,, where \\\\mathbf{k} is the electronic wave vector, E_{\\\\mathbf{k}} is the kinetic energy and V_{\\\\mathbf{k}}, \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{k}) are the Fourier transforms of V(\\\\mathbf{r}), \\\\phi_\\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{r}), respectively. The Coulomb sums follows from the convolution theorem and the \\\\mathbf{k}-representation is useful when introducing the generalized Wannier equation. Generalized Wannier equation The Wannier equation can be generalized by including the presence of many electrons and holes in the excited system. One can start from the general theory of either optical excitations or light emission in semiconductors that can be systematically described using the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBE) or the semiconductor luminescence equations (SLE), respectively.Kira, M.; Koch, S.W. (2006). \\"Many-body correlations and excitonic effects in semiconductor spectroscopy\\". Progress in Quantum Electronics 30 (5): 155–296. doi:10.1016/j.pquantelec.2006.12.002. The homogeneous parts of these equations produce the Wannier equation at the low-density limit. Therefore, the homogeneous parts of the SBE and SLE provide a physically meaningful way to identify excitons at arbitrary excitation levels. The resulting generalized Wannier equation is : \\\\tilde{\\\\epsilon}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{R}}(\\\\mathbf{k}) - \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k'}} V_{\\\\mathbf{k}-\\\\mathbf{k'}}^{\\\\mathrm{eff}} \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{R}}(\\\\mathbf{k'}) = \\\\epsilon_{\\\\lambda} \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{R}}(\\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\,, where the kinetic energy becomes renormalized : \\\\tilde{\\\\epsilon}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} = E_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\- \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}'} V_{{\\\\mathbf{k}}'-{\\\\mathbf{k}}} \\\\left(f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}'} + f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}'} \\\\right) \\\\,, by the electron and hole occupations f^e_{\\\\mathbf{k}} and f^h_{\\\\mathbf{k}}, respectively. These also modify the Coulomb interaction into : V_{\\\\mathbf{k}-\\\\mathbf{k'}}^{\\\\mathrm{eff}} \\\\equiv (1 - f^\\\\mathrm{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} -f^\\\\mathrm{h}_{\\\\mathbf{k}}) V_{\\\\mathbf{k}-\\\\mathbf{k'}} \\\\,, where (1 - f^\\\\mathrm{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} -f^\\\\mathrm{h}_{\\\\mathbf{k}}) weakens the Coulomb interaction via the so-called phase-space filling factor that stems from the Pauli exclusion principle preventing multiple excitations of fermions. Due to the phase-space filling factor, the Coulomb attraction becomes repulsive for excitations levels f^\\\\mathrm{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} +f^\\\\mathrm{h}_{\\\\mathbf{k}}>1. At this regime, the generalized Wannier equation produces only unbound solutions which follow from the excitonic Mott transition from bound to ionized electron–hole pairs. Once electron–hole densities exist, the generalized Wannier equation is not Hermitian anymore. As a result, the eigenvalue problem has both left- and right-handed eigenstates \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{L}}(\\\\mathbf{k}) and \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{R}}(\\\\mathbf{k}), respectively. They are connected via the phase-space filling factor, i.e. \\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{L}}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\phi_{\\\\lambda}^{\\\\mathrm{R}}(\\\\mathbf{k})/(1 - f^\\\\mathrm{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k}} -f^\\\\mathrm{h}_{\\\\mathbf{k}}). The left- and right- handed eigenstates have the same eigen value E_\\\\lambda (that is real valued for the form shown) and they form a complete set of orthogonal solutions since :\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\left[\\\\phi^L_\\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\right]^\\\\star \\\\, \\\\phi^R_ u(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}} \\\\left[\\\\phi^R_\\\\lambda(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\right]^\\\\star \\\\, \\\\phi^L_ u(\\\\mathbf{k})= \\\\delta_{\\\\lambda, u}. The Wannier equations can also be generalized to include scattering and screening effects that appear due to two-particle correlations within the SBE. This extension also produces left- and right-handed eigenstate, but their connection is more complicatedKira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. . than presented above. Additionally, E_\\\\lambda becomes complex valued and the imaginary part of E_\\\\lambda defines the lifetime of the resonance \\\\lambda. Physically, the generalized Wannier equation describes how the presence of other electron–hole pairs modifies the binding of one effective pair. As main consequences, an excitation tends to weaken the Coulomb interaction and renormalize the single-particle energies in the simplest form. Once also correlation effects are included, one additionally observes the screening of the Coulomb interaction, excitation-induced dephasing, and excitation-induced energy shifts. All these aspects are important when semiconductor experiments are explained in detail. Applications Due to the analogy with the hydrogen problem, the zero-density eigenstates are known analytically for any bulk semiconductor when excitations close to the bottom of the electronic bands are studied.Ashcroft, Neil W.; Mermin, N. David (1976). Solid State Physics. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. . In nanostructuredPaul Harrison (26 September 2011). Quantum Wells, Wires and Dots: Theoretical and Computational Physics of Semiconductor Nanostructures. John Wiley & Sons. . materials, such as quantum wells, quantum wires, and quantum dots, the Coulomb-matrix element V_{\\\\mathbf{k}} strongly deviates from the ideal two- and three-dimensional systems due to finite quantum confinement of electronic states. Hence, one cannot solve the zero-density Wannier equation analytically for those situations, but needs to resort to numerical eigenvalue solvers. In general, only numerical solutions are possible for all semiconductor cases when exciton states are solved within an excited matter. Further examples are shown in the context of the Elliott formula.

Luther Crawford Ladd (22 December 1843 – 19 April 1861) was a soldier in the Union Army who was killed during the Baltimore riot of 1861. He is often referred to as the first Union soldier killed in action during the American Civil War.* Four days earlier, Private Daniel Hough became the first non-combat casualty of the war when he was accidentally killed by a cannon that went off prematurely during a salute to the flag. Luther Crawford Ladd was 17 years old at the time of his death. Luther C. Ladd was born in Bristol, New Hampshire, the son of John Ladd. He resided on the Ladd farm, south of Fowler's River. In 1853 Luther and his father moved to nearby Alexandria, New Hampshire where he attended district schools. At age 16 in 1860, Ladd left Alexandria for Lowell, Massachusetts where he obtained employment at the Lowell Machine Shop. In April 1861 Luther answered President Lincoln's first call for 75,000 men by enlisting for three months in Co. D, 6th Massachusetts Militia. On April 19, 1861 while marching through the city of Baltimore this regiment was attacked by an angry mob. Luther C. Ladd was the first to fall. His injuries included a fractured skull and a fatal bullet wound that severed an artery in his thigh. Luther C. Ladd's remains were interred in the Alexandria Village Cemetery, later to be removed and buried beneath the Ladd & Whitney monument in Lowell, Massachusetts.

Background  The idea of having re-education rather than prosecution for driving offences was first raised in the North Report in the late 1980s. The report stated that \\"it must be in the public interest to rectify a fault rather than punish the transgressor\\" and \\"retraining of traffic offenders may lead to an improvement in their driving, particularly if their training is angled towards their failings\\". The NDORS scheme is governed by guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers and endorsed by the Crown Prosecution Service. In the year 2010-11, 41% of drivers caught speeding nationally took a course; in the following year the figure rose to 54%.  Course types and content  The ACPO guidance lists four types of course: * National driver alertness course (for non-serious collisions and complaints by 3rd parties) * National speed awareness course (for speeding up to 10% + 9 mph over the speed limit) * What's driving Us course (for conscious bad driving not resulting in a collision) * Driving 4 change course (for careless driving not resulting in a collision) Each of these courses is designed to address different types of driver error, including offences such as speeding, driving without due care and attention, using a mobile phone and failing to wear a seat belt.  Availability of courses in England and Wales  Whilst all 43 police forces in England and Wales are members of the NDORS Schemes, not all police forces provide access to all of the courses offered and therefore an enquiry has to be made with the individual police force to determine whether or not they offer a driver retraining scheme for the offence which has been committed. This is with the exception of speeding, for which all police forces in England and Wales offer the National Speed Awareness Course. Following a Freedom of Information Request made by solicitors in 2015, it has been established that the same courses are not offered by all 43 police forces across England and Wales.  Course delivery  Courses are offered at the discretion of the prosecuting authority - for example the South Yorkshire Safety Camera Partnership state that \\"although we do have the power to prosecute those who break the speed limit, we would rather persuade drivers to slow down\\". Whilst offered on a discretionary basis, guidance is issued to the 43 police forces operating in England and Wales as to when a driver should be considered as eligible to attend a course. The current guidance is contained within a document entitled, \\"National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme (NDORS): Guidance on Eligibility Criteria for NDORS Courses. In addition to a consideration of the circumstances of the offence in determining whether or not a person is eligible to attend on a course, the guidance provides that the police should also consider the following: *Whether or not there is a realistic prospect of conviction i.e. is there evidence that the person has committed the offence *There is no other offence committed i.e. it is a single offence *A similar course has not been attended within 3 years for a similar offence *The driver holds a Full UK Driving Licence or similar certificate of competence The courses are given by different types of provider - including private companies, the Police, and local councils - in different parts of the country and are provided at the offending driver's own expense. In 2012 The Daily Telegraph reported the cost of attending a speed awareness course to be £100.  Reception  A comprehensive review undertaken by a team led by Professor Robert Martin of Aston University Business School found that speed awareness courses had a \\"long term impact on driver behaviour\\". Martin stated that \\"the results clearly show that the speed awareness course led to reliable improvements in client's attitude to speeding and importantly their intention not to break the speed limit.\\"  Impact on insurance premiums  Some insurance companies, including Admiral Insurance, treat drivers who have attended speed awareness courses as if they have been convicted and raise their insurance premiums accordingly. Admiral Insurance stated that their figures show \\"people attending a speed awareness course are more likely to make a claim\\". ACPO has responded to this policy of \\"loading premiums\\", calling it \\"unfair\\" and \\"inappropriate\\". Other insurers also take a different view. A spokesman for AA insurance said \\"The view of most insurers, including the AA, is that attending a course is a responsible approach and should not be penalised by increasing premiums in the same way as a fixed penalty.\\" See also * Traffic school  References   External links  * Book a National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme course on gov.uk * NDORS Official Website Category:Law enforcement in the United Kingdom Category:Transport policy in the United Kingdom Category:Road safety Category:Driver's education Category:Driving in the United Kingdom Category:Road safety in the United Kingdom ","title":"National Driver Offender Retraining Scheme"},{"id":"39454877","text":"Pieter-Jan van Lill (born 4 December 1983 in Keetmanshoop, South-West Africa) is a Namibian rugby union player.

His career culminated in his appointment as British Ambassador to Morocco. Biography Reading Spanish and French at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, he became friendly with an Egyptian minister's son who invited him to Egypt, where they rode out with the Camel Corps and met a former prime minister at King Tutankhamun's tomb. Bailey's first posting was Beirut, where he was a Probationer Vice-Consul, also taking Arabic classes at the American University. After the fall of France in 1940 he arrived in Alexandria as vice-consul to receive a telegram announcing the arrival next day of 2,000 refugees from Greece. Two thousand mattresses were found; local ladies made corned beef soup; and ambulances were summoned after one of the ships was bombed. Among the refugees were the novelist Lawrence Durrell, King George II of the Hellenes (who shared Bailey's office) and a Greek priest with the name Jesus Christ on his passport – the man said God had called him to Jerusalem, but he was not entitled to a visa. When the Italians accused British troops of damaging archaeological sites in Cyrenaica, Bailey was sent with Professor Alan Rowe of Alexandria University to investigate, though the Germans were close by. They found one statue whose nose had been shot off by a drunken Polish soldier. Post-war After marrying Joan Gray in 1945, Bailey remained in Egypt. Another spell in Beirut was followed by a posting to Washington, replacing the Soviet spy Donald Maclean. As Head of Mission in Taiz in Yemen in the early 60s he survived a knife attack by a night-time intruder. He served as the British Ambassador in Bolivia between 1967 and 1971. Bailey arrived in Morocco for his last posting just after an attack had been made on the royal aeroplane, during which the king, Hassan II, had been forced to take the controls. But Bailey found it a tranquil appointment, not least because he could speak to the sovereign in Arabic, Spanish and French. After retiring in 1975 he founded the British Moroccan Society, and became president of the Society for the Protection of Animals in North Africa. He also was elected a Tory councillor in Haslemere and edited a 12-volume Records of Oman 1867-1960. He was appointed CMG in 1961.

The building is also known as La Pagode; this name comes from the French writer Louis- Ferdinand Céline, who remained in Douala in 1916-17, who calls it such in his famous novel Voyage au bout de la nuit (Journey to the End of the Night).Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Journey to the End of the Night (Voyage au bout de la nuit), 1932.  History  Ascending to the throne in 1897, Auguste Manga Ndumbe creates a large plantation of cocoa and palm oil in Mungo on the effluents of the Kamerun-Wui river, so as to compensate for the decline of the Douala economy based on the trade monopoly with the hinterland. He also carries out significant real estate investments in Bonanjo. At that time, the fortune of Auguste Manga exceeds by far that of its contemporaries and pars of Akwa, Deïdo, and Bonabéri. Deceased in 1908, he will not have however lived in this residence for three years. His son and heir Rudolph Douala Manga Bell reigns from 1908 to 1914, with his wife Emma Engomè Dayas. She was born from the union between the British captain Dayas and a young woman from Bali, Tébédi Eyoum. They will live there until the German authorities jail Rudolph and hang him on August 8, 1914. Alexandre Douala Manga Bell, the son of the late Rudolph, now celebrated as a hero and martyr, choose to live in Bali rather than this mansion. Known today as Le Parc des Princes, this compound includes the Bell’s Chefferie. Since 1920, the old mansion has been occupied by a long list of inhabitants and is still owned by the Bell royal family. Because of its history and its architecture, this building has always been an icon in Douala. In 2006 the building is highlighted by an urban sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presents an historical image of the building and a description of its history.Palace of the Kings Bell in Douala Ville d'art et d'histoire, doual'art, Douala, 2006.

By 1846, as part of the Tanzimat reforms, Thessalonica became the centre of a separate eyalet (Salonica Eyalet, after 1867 Salonica Vilayet), and hence the sanjak became the new province's pasha-sanjak. In 1912, the sanjak comprised the following districts (kazas): Selanik proper, Kesendire (Kassandra Peninsula), Karaferye (Veroia), Yenice Vardar (Giannitsa), Vodina (Edessa), Langaza (Langadas), Gevgelü (Gevgelija), Avret Hişar (Neo Gynaikokastro), Toyran (Star Dojran), Ustrumca (Strumica), Tikoş/Kavadar (Kavadarci), Katerin (Katerini), Aynaroz (Mount Athos) and Karaağaabad.

He earned a patent for his invention in 2012, making him the youngest patent-holder in India at that time. For his invention Bhati received the CavinKare Ability Special Recognition Award and the Sri Balaji Society's Child Innovator Award. He has since designed and received patents for twelve- and sixty-player versions of his game, with his boards capable of 100 distinct variations altogether. Besides circular chess, Bhati has developed a ramp system enabling easy access to vehicles for the disabled. In 2014 he was presented a Dr. Batra's Positive Health Award by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Bhati suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair. He credits his passion for invention to his admiration of British physicist Stephen Hawking: \\"I want to be like Hawking who became a famous scientist despite suffering from motor neuron disease.\\" Six-player circular chess Bhati's version of multiplayer chess is played on a circular board with 228 black and white cells (or ). The 12 red spaces are not used. Up to six players in teams of two or three can play. Bhati's design employs all the standard chess pieces and their moves. Individual armies are distinguished by colour. Six-player circular chess, starting setup Rules Each player starts the game with the same number and types of pieces as in standard chess. Non-pawn pieces start in their normal positions on the (the 8×1 extensions at the board perimeter), with queens always placed to the left of kings. Pawns are placed on the rank in front of the pieces as in standard chess. Red spaces cannot be occupied or passed through when moving or capturing. The multicoloured central area can be passed through but not occupied. It is considered a single \\"null\\" space, so a cell bordering it is considered adjacent to the cell on the direct opposite side of the null area. (E.g., a pawn on a cell bordering the null space that moves one step straight forward, will end its move on the opposite side of the null space on the same-coloured cell.) The king, knight, and pawn have their standard chess moves, unaffected when crossing the central null space, where a cell directly across is considered adjacent. A pawn promotes as normal when reaching any player's back rank. A rook moves horizontally along concentric rings of cells, and vertically along files, including crossing the central null space and continuing along the same file in a straight line. When moving horizontally, a rook cannot end its move on the same cell it started from. The queen moves horizontally and vertically the same as a rook. When a queen or bishop moves diagonally and then crosses the central null space to the opposite side, it must continue from a cell of the same colour it started from: it is moved one cell clockwise or anticlockwise after passing the null space, consistent with whether it began its diagonal movement in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction. When a player is checkmated or , all their remaining pieces are removed from play. In games where teams compete, the last team standing is the winner.

Advocacy groups such as Greenpeace, The Non-GMO Project, and the Organic Consumers Association say that risks of GM food have not been adequately identified and managed, and they have questioned the objectivity of regulatory authorities. They have expressed concerns about the objectivity of regulators and the rigor of the regulatory process, possible contamination of non-GM foods, effects of GMOs on the environment and nature, and the consolidation of control of the food supply in companies that make and sell GMOs. There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Although labeling of genetically modified organism (GMO) products in the marketplace is required in many countries, it is not required in the United States and no distinction between marketed GMO and non-GMO foods is recognized by the US FDA.Amy Harmon and Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. 24 May 2012 Battle Brewing Over Labeling of Genetically Modified Food Origin of the protests Tami Canal Founder Tami Canal, March Against Monsanto, Salt Lake City, Utah Tami Monroe Canal, a homemaker and mother of two daughters, was living as a resident in California when Proposition 37, a ballot initiative that would have required labels on products containing genetically engineered food, was rejected by voters in November 2012.

The Yule House was one of Melbourne’s first commercial buildings to exhibit the Streamline Moderne style (a branch of Art Deco) of architecture and began the style's rise in popularity throughout the 1930s. The current Yule House stands as a redesigned fireproof replacement of the original, which was destroyed by fire in 1931.Victorian Heritage Register. (n.d.). Yule House. Retrieved April 23, 2013, from Victorian Heritage Register: William Yule had been the owner of the land since the early 1900s and it remained part of his estate until 1985. Description William Yule, had been known of Percy Oakley of Oakley and Parkes, and commissioned the firm to redesign the Yule house following the fire. By Parkes’ accounts, the construction was impacted by the weak economic climate at the time. However, the redesign used modern materials in a new and interesting way while achieving fire resistance, as per Yule’s request. The structural material was reinforced concrete, supporting the Streamline Modern direction of the design. The Collins street façade features light-coloured terracotta faience tiles sourced from an Australian tile company Wunderlich, Ltd. Large protruding horizontal beams banded with three thin recessed strips of green tile define the floor levels and characterise the Streamline Modern Style. Large steel-framed, multi-paned windows sit between each beam; their thin vertical struts offering relief from the bold horizontality of the façade. The narrow site width made the span of these windows possible and allowed the maximum amount of natural light to penetrate the building; a desirable feature given the built-up surroundings.

The ground floor includes two retail shops with a central entrance tiled in beige terrazzo, with pink skirtings.

Terrazzo tiles continue into the building, lining the walls of the entrance, lower staircase, and housing the glass showcases, tenants’ directory, and the original brass-cased fire alarm. Office spaces are situated above the first floor. The small width of the building meant that a continuous column-free vertical span could be achieved providing unobstructed space on each floor.

Given the history of the Detector Group at Daresbury to develop detectors with a demand around the globe, spinning out a company to optimise this process was a logical step. The company was thought up independently a number of times by people in the management at Daresbury, but finally in 2005 the company was incorporated and domain name purchased and in 2007 the project was funded, in mid 2008 it gained the first employee. Diamond opened in January 2007 and the SRS closed in August 2008, leading to the relocation of Quantum Detectors to Harwell to stay with the UK's Synchrotron Facility. 10% of Quantum Detectors shares were then purchased by Diamond, who then elected a Director to the Quantum Detectors Board. The remaining 90% of the shares belong to STFC.

History  Between 1891 and 1901, the building hosted the first German administrative headquarters in Cameroon. The headquarters were then transferred to Buea, and then back to Douala in 1908 following the eruption of Mount Cameroon. The first German Governor, Julius von Soden, in office from 1885 to 1891, divided the country into administrative areas. Von Soden launched military campaigns mostly within the hinterland, subjecting local kingdoms and imposing the German flag and law. His successor, Eugen von Zimmerer institutionalized the police through a decision dated 16 October 1891, as well as the colonial army, i.e. the Schutztruppe. The latter was composed by German officers, black slave soldiers bought or enrolled in Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Gabon and Sierra Leone. The Schutztruppe was assembled to complete the military conquest and maintain the colonial empire, which was challenged by local resistance up to the First World War. During the French Mandate, the capital was moved to Yaoundé, with the decree of 1 March 1921 and the High Commissioner Delegate occupied the building. The building currently hosts Douala 1st district sous-préfécture. In 2006 the building is highlighted by an urban sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presents an historical image of the building and a description of its history.Old German government headquarters in Douala Ville d'art et d'histoire, doual'art, Douala, 2006.

Originally, it featured a flat roof of concrete- wood, covered with a 30 cm thick layer of sand. This structure did not endure the heavy rains and was replaced in the 1900 by a four-slopes roof.

He is a national vice-president of the Orthodox Union and a national officer of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA). Luchins is a \\"much-lauded longtime Orthodox Jewish activist\\"Kampeas, Ron, What to know about Jonathan Pollard’s upcoming release, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 16 November 2015. Retrieved 18 November 2015 who is active in Jewish communal life and is a frequent speaker on educational, political and Jewish topics. Luchins served as an aide to then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey and for 20 years on the Senate staff of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  Life and career  Luchins was born in New York City, the eldest son of Abraham Luchins, a Gestalt psychologist, and Edith Hirsch Luchins, a mathematician and psychologist, who was one of the first women to serve on the national board of the Orthodox Union. He is a graduate of Yeshiva College, where he studied under Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik in his sophomore year and four years under Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik. In 1977, Luchins earned his Ph.D. from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He has been chairman of the political science department at Touro College since 1978, where he teaches courses in American politics and international relations and serves as founding dean of Touro's Lander College for Women. Luchins is a frequent speaker at high schools, colleges, synagogues and Jewish communal groups in North America and Israel, lecturing on political and social issues. In summer, he serves as a guest instructor at Aish HaTorah, an Orthodox religious outreach program located in the Old City of Jerusalem. He has been a vice- president of the Orthodox Union since 1976 and a member of the executive committee of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs since 1984. He formerly served on the national commissions of the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Fund for Justice. Luchins is married to Vivian Luchins née Osdoby, a graduate of Yeshiva University's Stern College for Women. The couple met as high school students active in the National Conference of Synagogue Youth, the Orthodox Union's youth organization. Now called simply NCSY, the organization honored the Luchins in 2011 for 50 years of service. Vivian Luchins is chair of NCSY summer programs, a senior member of the Orthodox Union's youth commission and a member of the Orthodox Union's national board. The couple lives in the Bronx.  Politically liberal and religiously Orthodox  A longtime political supporter of, and advisor to, Democratic candidates and office-holders, Luchins has also supported and advised Republicans. Writing in The Jewish Daily Forward, Jeffrey Goldberg described Luchins as \\"a liberal – or a 'leftist', as he prefers – in an Orthodox community that is ever-more conservative [whose] tart tongue has often landed him in the center of controversy.\\" Luchins served on the 1972 presidential campaign staff of Senator Hubert Humphrey, and subsequently as a national vice chair of Democrats for Nixon. For 20 years, he served on the Senate staff of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, rising from special assistant to senior advisor. He later supported Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato. After Moynihan's funeral in 2003, at Arlington National Cemetery, Luchins indicated that he would be withdrawing from political activities, saying \\"everything I cared about in politics was buried Monday in Arlington Cemetery.\\" In 2004, Luchins spoke on behalf of the Orthodox Union about Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's Gaza disengagement plan, saying that \\"Jews who want to take sides in Israeli politics should make aliya,\\" using the Hebrew word for immigration to the State of Israel. Luchins has argued that Jewish tradition stands in opposition to fundamentalism. For the 2008 book, Progressive & Religious: How Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist Leaders are Moving Beyond Partisan Politics and Transforming American Public Life, Luchins was asked how it was possible to be \\"an Orthodox liberal\\". He answered that an Orthodox social conservative \\"would be pretty lonely because you don't have too many sources, because the vast part of our religious tradition talks about ... tikkun olam, helping others; it's the number one priority of faith\\". In 2009, Luchins offered a reporter writing about elections in New York's ultra- Orthodox Jewish communities example after example of cases where non-Jewish candidates (or non-observant Jewish candidates) who seemed likely to deliver services won out over religiously identified Jewish politicians. \\"Constituent services trumps personal biography every single time in the Orthodox Jewish community ... without exception,\\" he observed. In a 2013 lecture on \\"Gay Marriages Revisited\\", delivered at the Israel Center in Jerusalem, Luchins, who considers himself a \\"staunch gay rights supporter\\", made the point that \\"punishment for cheating in business according to the Torah is greater than for the sum total of all the sexual atrocities forbidden by the Torah\\". Upholding that gay relationship is forbidden by Jewish law, he adds that \\"the fact that the Torah forbids certain behavior does not mean we should demonize, delegitimize or write out of our religion or our humanity those who may fall short, as we all fall short in so many areas... In the area of kindness to every human being, Jew and Gentile, white and black, gay and straight, even Republicans are created in the image of God.\\"  Awards  In 2015, Luchins received the Albert D. Chernin Award from the Jewish Council for Public Affairs (JCPA) at its annual meeting, the 2015 Jewish Community Town Hall, October 10–13, in Washington, D.C. The Chernin Award is given to Jewish leaders whose life work best exemplifies the social justice imperatives of Judaism, Jewish history, and the protection of The Bill of Rights.http://engage.jewishpublicaffairs.org/o/5145/p/salsa/web/blog/public/entries?blog_entry_KEY=7591http://jcpaplenum.org/dr- david-luchins-2015-albert-d-chernin-recipient/ Threat of excommunication In 1994, Milton Balkany, a conservative Republican active in political fundraising, tried to have Luchins excommunicated by a Jewish religious court, blaming him for having \\"caused yeshivas in the land of Israel to lose money\\", after Luchins had complained about Balkany's efforts to compel Israeli government officials to use U.S. aid money for projects Balkany favored in Israel. In March 1995, a Rabbinic Court dismissed all charges against Luchins. After Balkany was charged in February 2010 with trying to extort $4 million from a Connecticut hedge fund to keep information that he said was damaging secret, Luchins expressed surprise and doubt, saying \\"while I've had my own run-ins with him in the past, and I'm certainly not a fan of his politics, it's hard to believe someone so intelligent and capable would [d]o something so incredibly stupid. I hope and pray the charges are proven wrong.\\" Balkany was later found guilty of all charges. Chabad Lubavitch Personal and family relationship In a 2009 interview with Chabad Lubavitch News, Luchins affirmed his and his family's personal connection to Chabad Lubavitch and to Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn and Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the sixth and seventh Lubavitcher Rebbes. Luchins has been a guest speaker at Chabad Lubavitch events. Lubavitch messianism In late June 1996 several Jewish newspapers published a statement signed by Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik opposing attacks on Lubavitcher Hasidim who believed that the late Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe, who had died in 1994, was the Messiah. The statement said that the messianists' belief in the role of the rebbe, even after his death, \\"cannot be dismissed as a belief that is outside the pale of Orthodoxy\\". Lubavitch messianists celebrated the statement and Jews for Jesus released their own announcement, expressing satisfaction with \\"the Tzaddik from Chicago\\". Luchins, after consulting with Soloveichik, wrote a letter published in the Jewish Daily Forward and the Jewish Week, condemning the way Soloveichik's words were presented, saying that \\"using Rabbi Soloveichik in this way is a tremendous disservice to one of the great Torah giants of our generation,\\" and adding \\"I am certain the Lubavitcher rebbe would be deeply pained by this use of Rabbi Soloveichik's name.\\" The Jonathan Pollard case Luchins has advocated the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew sentenced to life in prison for spying for Israel; he has also described the pro-Pollard movement a \\"cult\\", saying that \\"Pollard has become a flag of convenience.... He's become a cause that is picked up by other people and used for their own purposes.\\" In a March 2007 interview with Susan Rosenbluth of The Jewish Voice and Opinion, Luchins, a student of Rabbi Ahron Soleveichik and a senior advisor to Daniel Patrick Moynahan, described the men's role in trying to free Pollard. According to Luchins, shortly after then-President Bill Clinton 1993 inauguration, he was approached by Moynihan and Senator Joseph Lieberman about Pollard's release; the president was reportedly willing to commute Pollard's sentence and order his release if he wrote a letter expressing clear remorse. Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik brought a letter of apology vetted by the White House to Pollard in prison, for his signature. Reportedly, Pollard signed the letter and Lieberman hand-delivered it to Clinton. However, while the letter was still on Clinton's desk, Pollard is reported to have had a change of heart, renouncing the letter and criticizing a portion that apologized for violating Jewish law. According to Luchins, Pollard was pressured by \\"the Pollard people, the more intense members of the cult\\", with the result that what seemed like a firm deal to accomplish Pollard's release from prison fell apart. Esther Pollard (Eileen Zeitz) denies that Pollard was ever asked to sign any such letter. Luchins' life was threatened by Pollard supporters who circulated a flyer that has been characterized as \\"a Salman Rushdie-style religious decree calling for Luchins' murder\\".

In 2000 the building was extended with two additional wings in a project initiated by the Department of Justice.  History  Under the German administration (1884-1914), three judiciary bodies were created: a landlords’ court, a tribes’ court and an arbitration court. The Douala landlords were subjected to a patent in order to exercise as customary judges, and gained some income from it. Their competence to fine and jail was restricted to 100 marks and six months. Beyond these figures and up to the death penalty, only the German civil laws had force of law. In parallel, a council of notables collaborated with the German governor on the questions of social organization. During the Franco-British condominium (1916-1919), and until the granting of the Mandate by the Company of the Nations (1922), the French administration works within the legal framework left by the Germans and preserves the same indigenous jurisdictions. Under the French Mandate, as of the construction of the law courts, in 1930, these jurisdictions are replaced by courts of 1st and 2nd degree. This reorganization removes the consequent material advantages that the Douala landlords’ possessed. This displeases them immensely. They made their dissatisfaction heard, maintaining clandestine courts, and even restore the pre-colonial traditional authorities. Until 1941, the French administration will preserve the Council of notable, while applying the code of the indigénat, heir to the Code Noir established by Louis XIV at the beginning of the 18th century. This legal situation will end in Cameroon only after the French Liberation and the Conference of Brazzaville in 1944. Today this building shelters the Court of Appeal of the Littoral.

This business route, which has since been decommissioned, was designated in 1955 over what used to be US 1 Business, and US 1A before that, meaning SR 178 has historically terminated at one of these routes. When these historical designation(s) were removed, SR 178's terminus was never moved, and thus it now terminates along SR 9 one block north of its terminus with US 1A.

History  Designed by the German architect Henri Drees, this hospital was built in 1896 following Dr Albert Plehn’s initiative. It was created to take care of Europeans patients only, since it was based on the colonialist ideology of that time which was highly segregationist. It was first named \\"Nachtigal Hospital\\", on behalf of the roving Consul Nachtigal. Doctor Gustav Nachtigal was in charge of representing Emperor of Germany William I and the Chancellor Bismarck all over the gulf of Guinea. He made legal the 1884 treaties signed with the kings of Douala, instituting German Protectorate on the territory. He supplanted The late consul, nickname given to the British Consul Hewett, still retained in his official duties in Fernando Poo (now Malabo), who got to Cameroon Town too late to negotiate a British establishment in this city. Finally, Nachtigal's remarkable career ended with the official installation of Julius von Soden as the first German Governor, from 1885 to 1891, long before the construction of the hospital. The French author Louis-Ferdinand Céline, arrived in 1916 in a still German-speaking town, depicted his short stay in this hospital in a memorable extract from his novel Voyage au bout de la nuit. This building, amazingly gorgeous at that time, was extended twice its size under the French Mandate in 1930. This same year, the French administration built \\"Hôpital Laquintinie\\" for the natives, in the same spirit as during the German Freie Zone, a one-kilometer unoccupied zone, conceived to separate Europeans from the natives. Renamed Hôpital Général when Independence took place, this building includes today the Police department and the Littoral Delegation of Culture. In 2006 the building is highlighted by an urban sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presents an historical image of the building and a description of its history.Former general Hospital of Douala in Douala Ville d'art et d'histoire, doual'art, Douala, 2006.

Debtors were imprisoned there by order of the Court of Conscience and Lord Mayor's Court of the county of the city of Dublin. The maximum debt was £10 in the Lord Mayor's Court, and 40s. (£2) in the Court of Conscience. Name Other debtor's prisons in Dublin which shared the name were the Four Courts Marshalsea, and the Marshalseas of Saint Sepulchre (abolished 1856) and of Thomas Court and Donore (abolished 1826). The original Marshalsea prison from which these were named was built in Southwark south of the City of London, for prisoners from the Marshalsea Court presided over by the Knight Marshal. Conditions After the closure of The Black Dog prison in 1794 the City Marshalsea was considered the worst prison in the city.Report on the State of Prisons in Ireland, 1818, p. 9 (Report of Rev. P. Gamble, Local Inspector) It was run privately for profit; John Thomas Gilbert wrote that \\"the passers-by were incessantly assailed by the cries of the inmates soliciting charity for their maintenance, or the discharge of their fees\\". Families of prisoners could also reside there, to protect them from their creditors. In 1823 the inspectors of prisons report improvement from the previous year. In 1836 the Royal Commission on the Poorer Classes in Ireland said the common hall was \\"a disgrace to the city\\". History The first City Marshalsea was built in 1704 on Merchants' Quay, between Skipper's Lane and Swan Alley.Gilbert 1854 p.373 Until 1796, the Dublin City Marshal was Keeper of the Dublin City Marshalsea. In 1802 a report from the Committee on City Leases stated that the City Marshalsea had become so ruinous and insecure that a new one was absolutely necessary. In 1803 Robert Emmet used it as an arsenal during his abortive rebellion. In 1805 it was relocated, to a brick building attached to the Sheriffs' Prison in Green Street, beside the sessions house (later Green Street Court House). Suppression The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished the power of arrest from the Court of Conscience and Lord Mayor's Court, so that no new prisoners were committed to the City Marshalsea. Remaining prisoners were transferred to the Four Courts Marshalsea. The Dublin Militia used it as a barracks in the later 19th century. It stood empty for some years before its demolition in 1975. Some of the stone went to repair the old city wall at Cook Street.

The waterworks was part of the first phase of industrial investments aimed at the urbanisation of Kamerunstadt (Douala). The supply of running water was necessary to allow the implementation of the major development works which would radically transform the traditional village of Douala into an urban agglomeration of administrative and commercial buildings, private residences, places of worship and schools. The urban plan of von Brautisch, head of Kamerunstadt district under the government of Jesko von Puttkamer (1895-1907), changed the local way of life and economy: wide streets were opened up, the Bonaku (Akwatown) marshes were drained, an embankment was built providing a route between Bonanjo and Akwa, the harbour area was expanded... henceforward denying fishermen any direct access to the river. The railway infrastructure created from the beginning of the 20th century was to develop communications with the country’s interior. Thus the Besséké valley became home to the first station on the town’s left bank, in the port area. From 1909 the Northern railway line was completed, linking Bonabéri and Nkongsamba. Work on the line joining Douala and Yaoundé began at the end of 1910-beginning of 1911. Requisitioned as forced labour for these undertakings, the human cost of laying the foundations for the new colonial economy was a high one for the local workforce.

It was released under the new band's name. As a promotional single, \\"Tumbling Down\\" was not eligible to make a chart appearance. Although it was not a single in the UK or Europe, the song remains one of Harley's most popular. Since its release, it has become a regular inclusion at Harley and the band's concerts and has appeared on numerous compilations. The song was recorded during February-March 1974, and was mastered at Abbey Road Studios. It features an orchestra and choir, with arrangements by Andrew Powell. Release \\"Tumbling Down\\" was released by EMI Records on 7\\" vinyl in America only.

Guarisco of AllMusic also spoke of the song in a review of the A Closer Look compilation, referring to the song as, \\"another dramatic opus that gradually builds from quiet piano chords to an orchestral blowout as Harley vocalizes a pained but elegantly crafted tale of facing a grim destiny.\\" German website Altona Info spoke of the song in 2009, commenting, \\" ... the music has withstood the test of time without damage,\\" and calling the song, \\"a real pop gem.\\" In the 2007 Italian book 24.000 Dischi (24,000 Discs), authors Riccardo Bertoncelli and Cris Thellung said \\"Tumbling Down\\" is one of a handful of, \\"fine examples of a decadent rock that uses a lot of the shape of the ballad and enriches it with very theatrical choreography.\\" Track listing ;7\\" Single #\\"Tumbling Down (Stereo)\\" - 3:23 #\\"Tumbling Down (Mono)\\" - 3:23 Personnel ;Cockney Rebel * Steve Harley – vocals, producer * Jean-Paul Crocker – electric violin, guitar * Milton Reame- James – keyboards * Paul Jeffreys – Fender bass * Stuart Elliott – drums, percussion ;Additional personnel * Alan Parsons - producer * Andrew Powell – orchestral and brass arrangements * Chris Blair - mastering Cover versions Yvonne Keeley version In 1974, Dutch singer Yvonne Keeley released her own version of the song as her debut single.

She recorded \\"Tumbling Down\\", as well as \\"Loretta's Tale\\", which had originally appeared on Cockney Rebel's 1973 debut album The Human Menagerie. EMI released the single in August 1974, however it was not a commercial success and failed to enter the UK Top 50. Harley would go on to form a relationship with Keeley and they would work together in the studio again. Keeley provided backing vocals on future Cockney Rebel albums, while Harley would produce her second single \\"Concrete and Clay\\", released in June 1975.http://www.oocities.org/sunsetstrip/backstage/3020/Hanstev.html On \\"Tumbling Down\\", Scottish musician Ian Bairnson recorded the guitar part with a Les Paul. It was one of Bairnson's earliest sessions and was one that had the most impact on his career. At the time, Bairnson had moved from Edinburgh to London to make it in the music business with the Scottish rock band Pilot, who had yet to gain a hit single. After being impressed by his playing on the song, Harley had asked Bairnson to join Cockney Rebel. At the time, Harley was still searching for a new Cockney Rebel line-up. Faced with this dilemma, Bairnson ended up choosing to stay with his band, who gained their first hit with \\"Magic\\" later in November that year.http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/15155/pilot/ =Release= The single was released by EMI Records on 7\\" vinyl in the UK only.

History  Banks of the Wouri River, Douala Monument of Din Ngosso The police station is the site where King Rudolf Douala Manga Bell and his assistant Adolf Ngosso Din were sentenced to death and hung. Both men has been sentenced following their staunch opposition to the June 1910 Decree issued by Governor Ebermaier and ordering the expropriation and resettlement of natives from Joss, Bonapriso, Akwa and Deïdo. The Germans decided to seize the land along the banks of Wouri River, thus violating the sovereignty clause which left the land to the natives as specified in the treaty signed on July 12, 1884 between the Duala Kings and German authorities. On the other hand, a one-kilometre buffer zone or “Freie Zone” was established between the Whites and the Blacks. Rehousing sites were then created for displaced people: Neu Bell, Neu Akwa, and Neu Deïdo. From 1912 to 1914, commissioned by the Ngondo Vernacular Council, Rudolf and his assistant called for general mobilization in Cameroon and in Germany in order to defend their rights before the Reichstag, the German parliament. Nevertheless, the first expropriations began in December 1913. In May 1914, under the premise of a false document said to have been issued by King Bell and addressed to Sultan Njoya, which allegedly pleaded for an alliance with England, both protesters were caught, held in custody within this police station, sentenced for treason and hung on August 18, 1914. Only this stump is left of the tree from which they were hung. The First World War had just started in Europe. As hostile war ships sailed towards Cameroon, the Germans speeded up the trial in order to face the expected assaults from the enemy. At the same time, in an attempt to neutralise growing internal opposition, 180 natives were hung shortly after Rudolf and Ngosso Din. In September 1914, with the help of Duala canoeists, French and English troops got into the channel blocked with vessels the Germans had wrecked. This edifice now hosts the merchant navy services. In 2006 the building is highlighted by an urban sign produced by doual'art and designed by Sandrine Dole; the sign presents an historical image of the building and a description of its history.Former police station of Douala in Douala Ville d'art et d'histoire, doual'art, Douala, 2006.

Nanyemba worked as a diplomat, representing SWAPO in Botswana and Tanzania, before he was elected as the party Secretary of Defence in 1970. He played an important role as the chief organizer of PLAN during the beginning stages of the war of independence. Nanyemba is considered a national hero in Namibia. Early years and career Nanyemba was born and grew up in Ovamboland in the north of Namibia and had to work as a herder during his school years. He subsequently moved to Walvis Bay where he participated in the circles critical of the apartheid regime. He joined the Ovamboland People's Organization (OPO) in 1958 while working in Walvis Bay. Nanyemba became aware of the harshness of the colonial and apartheid system. He was inspired and encouraged by many who shared his vision of a free and independent Namibia. When SWAPO was formed in 1960, Nanyemba became one of its leading activists and was later elected as its secretary for the Walvis Bay branch where he started with anti-colonial campaigns and mobilization of the masses of the people to resist colonial authority. As a result, he was arrested in 1961, detained, and deported back to Ovamboland.Peter Eneas Nanyemba affectionately known as \\"Ndlimani Yomukunda Gwamupolo\\" New Era Newspaper, 17 October 2014 In 1962, Nanyemba left Namibia to join other SWAPO leaders abroad in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. He quickly rose through the ranks and was appointed as Chief Representative for SWAPO in Botswana in 1963. He was recalled back to Tanzania in 1964 to serve as Chief Representative for East Africa, a position he held until 1969. During the controversial SWAPO Tanga Consultative Conference that took place between 1969 and 1970, Nanyemba was elected SWAPO Secretary of Defence, a crucial position at the time as the struggle for independence was getting more intense. Following the collapse of the Portuguese colonial empire in Africa in 1974 thousands of young Namibians fled the country via Angola to join SWAPO and thus swelled the ranks of PLAN. It was at this stage of the struggle that Nanyemba began to play an important role in developing and organising PLAN into a real guerrilla fighting force. He was instrumental in arranging training and equipping PLAN. Under his leadership in 1977, the Swapo Military Council was reconstituted as the highest decision making body of PLAN. He became the first chairman of the military council and chaired it until 1982, when Sam Nujoma as commander in chief took over. In 1977, with the help of the Soviet military advisers he established the Tobias Hainyeko Training Centre (THTC) in Lubango. The four military regions, Eastern, North Eastern, Northern and North Western, were created under his leadership in 1977. He help set up another training centre, Jumbo Training Centre (JTC), west of Lubango in 1978. In 1979, under his supervision, the Operational Command Headquarters (OCHQ) was established. This was the headquarter of PLAN. Nanyemba had many achievements with PLAN under his leadership as SWAPO Secretary for Defence making PLAN the effective and efficient fighting machine it was. Death Nanyemba was killed on 1 April 1983 in a car accident in Lubango in the Angola's Huila Province, when his car collided with a petrol tanker. His remains were repatriated from Angola 31 years after his death and reburied at Windhoek Heroes Acre. Remains of gallant fighters laid to rest at the Shrine of the Heroes' Acres.

Brighton remained in A1 until they finished last in 1965, played the next three seasons in A2 before shifting back to the now Glenelg- South Adelaide Football Association in 1969. Brighton remained in the Glenelg- South Adelaide FA until its demise at the end of 1986, by then known as the Southern Metropolitan Football League, when they shifted to the South Australian Football Association (SAFA).

BHOS made it three-in-a-row in 1971, winning the A4 premiership and securing their place in A3. BHOS remained in A3 for six seasons before securing promotion through a Grand Final loss to Old Ignatians in 1976. BHOS only lasted for three seasons in A2 before being relegated to A3 for the 1980 season. 1981 saw an A3 wooden spoon and relegation to A4, followed by the wooden spoon in the A4 competition in 1982 to land in A5. An A5 Grand Final loss in 1985 to Salisbury College resulted in promotion to A4 and was directly followed by the A4 premiership in 1986. The following season, BHOS again secured promotion via a losing grand final, this time to Goodwood Saints.

Using argon gas etching to open the cells and a scanning electron microscope to create a three- dimensional view, researchers can harness this technique to track how cells function. This is most importantly used to assess how cells react to medication, for instance in the field of cancer research. It was first discovered in 2010 by Professor Lodewyk Kock and his team working in the biotechnology department at the University of the Free State in South Africa. The technique was adapted from Nano Scanning Auger Microscopy (NanoSAM), a technique used by physical scientists to study the surface structures of metal and inanimate materials such as semiconductors. Originally designed to observe yeast cells to find out more about how they manufactured the gas that causes bread to rise, the scientists discovered that the process could also be used in observing other living cells. In 2012 the technique was successfully applied to human cell tissue.  History  The project was initiated at the University of the Free State by the Kock group in 1982, with the major inputs and breakthroughs occurring between 2007 and 2012. The initial aim was to explore lipid biochemical routes, which would uncover unique lipids in yeasts, and to develop new taxonomies on the structures of these lipids. This unfolded into the development of the anti-mitochondrial antifungal assay (3A system), where yeast sensors are used to indicate anti-mitochondrial activity in compounds. These compounds, aimed at selectively switching off the mitochondria, therefore, might find application in combating various diseases such as fungal infections and cancer. Auger architectomics, which opens up individual cells to scan them, can be used to assess the effectiveness of such drugs by determining if a single cell can be \\"powered down\\" with targeted treatment. Based on the development of the anti-mitochondrial antifungal assay system, the University of the Free State scientists felt there was a need to analyse the system in more detail. As a result, they adapted Nano Scanning Auger Microscopy, a technique used to scan the properties of metals in physics, to apply it to cells. The result was a combination of auger atom electron physics, electron microscopy, and argon etching. The main challenge in applying the technology to biological material was to invent a sample preparation procedure that would ensure that the atom and 3D structure remained stable while argon nano-etching occurred. During the NanoSAM scanning electron microscope visualisation, an electron beam at 25 kV is used instead of the normal 5 kV beam. Sample fixation and dehydration methods had to be developed and optimised to fit NanoSAM without creating sample distortions. Dehydration regimes based on alcohol extraction procedures were installed and optimised, while fixation using various fixatives was included. Electron conductivity of samples throughout Argon etching was assured by optimised gold sputtering.  Procedure  Firstly, the biological sample is plated with gold to stabilise the outer structure and make it electron conductive. It is then scanned in SEM mode and the surface visually enlarged. Auger atom electron physics are applied and selected areas on the sample surface are beamed with electrons. The incident beam ejects an electron in the inner orbital of the atom, leaving an open space. This is filled by an electron from an outer orbital by relaxation. Energy is released, causing the ejection of an electron from the outer orbital. This electron is called the Auger electron. The amount of energy that is released is measured by auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and used to identify the atom and its intensity. Similarly, the surface area can be screened by an electron beam eventually yielding auger electrons that are mapped, showing the distribution of atoms in different colours covering a surface area of predetermined size. The previously-screened surface of the sample is etched with argon, exposing a new surface of the sample that is then again analysed. In this way, a 3-dimensional image and element composition architecture of the whole cell is visualised.  Discoveries  This process in nanotechnology led to the discovery of gas bubbles inside yeasts. This is considered a paradigm shift, since naked gas bubbles are not expected inside any type of cell due to structured water in the cytoplasm. This was exposed in a fluconazole-treated bubble-like sensor of the yeast Nadsonia. This is the only technology known at present that can accomplish this type of nano- analysis on biological material.  Use in medicine  Nanotechnology developments in medicine allow microdoses of drugs and therapies to be delivered directly to infected cells, instead of killing large groups of cells, often at the expense of healthy cells. Gold at a nano-level has the ability to bind to certain types of biological material, which means that certain types of cells can be targeted. The technique of auger architectomics may be used to map the success or otherwise of targeted drug delivery by analysing cells. The team at the University of the Free State is working with the Mayo Clinic to use the technology as a part of their cancer research.

Works by Joseph Lacasse during an exhibition in Milan, 1958. Photo by Paolo Monti. Early years Born in Tournai, Belgium in 1894 in a working-class family, Lacasse started his apprenticeship to become a painter- decorator as early as 1905. He was accepted the following year as a free student at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Tournai where he continued his training until 1921. As a young boy, Lacasse worked alongside his father as a stone- cutter in a local quarry. His abstract pastels, dated 1910, were painted after a day of hard work, where the austere structure of the quarry fired his imagination. These early pastels are completely geometrical, though not symmetrical, and their aggressive shapes are softened by rounded lines. They are dominated by a powerful black construction, traced with great surety. After surviving the horrors of the First World War, Lacasse became a successful painter of figurative scenes illustrating the condition of the working classes, often depicted against a religious background. Following a trip to South Italy in 1921, where he painted his ‘motherhood’ series, always in a style of emphasized realism, he decided to enroll at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts, Brussels where Lacasse met his future wife, Stephanie Lupsin, daughter of the renowned art dealer.BILCKE, Maurits. et al. Joseph Lacasse par lui-même. Mercator, Antwerp, 1974. The First Paris Period Following several travels to Italy, Brittany and Spain, Lacasse finally decided to settle in Paris in 1925. Here, his acquaintance with Robert Delaunay was crucial to his colouristic development. During this period he also became friend with neighbouring Constantin Brâncuși and the writers Robert Garric and Henry Poulaille. Throughout the thirties, Lacasse turned to Abstraction for consolation from the disillusionment over the painting and the forced removal of his frescoes at the Dominican Chapel at Juvisy during 1931-32. In 1933 Lacasse founded the gallery L’Equipe inspired by his socialist ideas that artists of all disciplines should come together to exchange ideas and to fight for the right to be shown. The gallery played an important role on the Parisian art scene with exhibitions showing the works of many including Jacques Lipchitz, Moïse Kisling, Francis Picabia and Pablo Picasso. Lacasse himself had a one-man show at L’Equipe in 1937 during which he showed some of his abstract work. Lacasse’s coloristic developments of the time also testify his great admiration for Robert Delaunay whom, according to Michel Seuphor, he met in 1931 and whose gatherings at his studio Lacasse attended during 1938 and 1939. Other artists he met included Serge Poliakoff, who then started visiting L'Equipe. At the time of their meeting Poliakoff was still committed to figuration. In 1939 L'Equipe published its first three magazines.Joseph Lacasse, exhibition catalogue with introduction by VAN DE BUSSCHE, Willy and An Jo FERMON, Whitford Fine Art, London, 2013. The Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War, Lacasse decided to join General de Gaulle’s Resistance by moving to London with the Free French Forces. During the five years of wars Lacasse seemed to have put aside painting while teaching sculpture and ceramics in Stoke-on-Trent. During this period he was totally cut off from his family.  The Second Paris Period His absence from Paris cost him dearly for the Parisian artistic community had continued without him. In a moment of depression, he destroyed more than a hundred paintings. Having become a French citizen in 1946, Lacasse, encouraged by his wife and friends, went back to painting. Until his death in 1975, Lacasse’s work became the subject of countless exhibitions abroad including UK, Germany and the USA.RENWART, Marc.

History  The Cathedral of St Peter and St Paul was built in 1936 by French Spiritans fathers and it is based on the legacy of the fathers Pallotins. The advent of Catholicism in Cameroon has its origins in Germany through the baptism of the first Cameroonian catechumen, Andreas Kwa Mbange, on January 6, 1889. Born in 1873, he reaches the age of 14 years to learn the craft baker. He then discovers the Catholic cult in a Benedictine Monastery and asks to be baptized. Following the christening, the question of evangelization in Cameroon was discussed in Berlin and Rome. The year 1890 is decisive. In March, a decree of Pope Leo XIII creates the apostolic prefecture of Cameroon and entrusts the Pallottines Missionaries. On October 25, 1890, the father Vieter, prefect apostolic landed at Kamerunstadt (Douala), the head of a delegation of seven missionaries. The following day, October 26, 1890, he celebrates the first Catholic mass in Cameroonian land, in the Woermann factory in Bonanjo, then known as Belldorf. But in December 1890, faced with the hostility of Protestants who want to keep the hand-setting Kamerunstadt, Catholic missionaries were forced to leave the coast. They founded the first Catholic mission in Cameroon in Marienberg (Sanaga). The local rivalries between Catholics and Protestants was also expressed about the language of instruction for denominational school, an indispensable tool for religious propaganda. The Pallotins leave Cameroon in the wake of the Germans after their defeat in 1914, and are replaced by French Spiritans in 1916. Photo by Sandrine Dole, 2010.

Furniture for animals Known as \\"pet furniture\\", furniture designed for use by animals became a popular trend in the early 21st century. Typical pieces include pet beds, doghouses, hammocks, dog coolers, cat trees, parrot tents and extravagant play equipment. In 2008, James Stephenson and Jason R. Rich cited high-end furniture for cats and dogs as one of the best categories of products to buy and sell for big profits. Home- crafted furniture for pets has also become popular. Furniture made from animals 1877 Wheeler Bear Skin Chair Animal furniture also refers to furniture made from animals. Such furniture became popular during the Victorian era. In 1896, William G. Fitzgerald wrote an article titled \\"Animal Furniture\\" in The Strand Magazine. The article included a photographic gallery of unusual pieces from the era, including a liquor stand made from an elephant's foot, a door stop made from an ostrich foot, a candelabra made from a monkey, lamps made from a black swan, an emu, monkeys, and a black bear, a chair made from a baby giraffe (with neck and head rising from the back, a porter's chair made out of a baby elephant, and a \\"tiger chair\\" with the seat covered in the animal's skin, the tail coiled around the edge, and \\"the head and paws ... arranged so as to give the impression that the terrible animal is about to spring.\\" In a 1907 book on big game hunting in Ceylon, Harry Storey described his practices of making furniture out of elephant parts: > \\"Of trophies to be secured from our elephants the feet rank first . . .

He is Emeritus Professor of Materials at Queen Mary, University of London. Education, qualifications and specialisms After completing a BSc degree in theoretical physics at the University of London in 1953, Edgar Andrews obtained a PhD in applied physics in 1960 (more specific: solid-state physics) and a DSc (higher doctorate) in physics in 1968. He is a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP), Fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (FIMMM), Chartered Engineer (CEng, UK) and Chartered Physicist (CPhys). Andrews is also an international expert on the science of polymers (large molecules). Career From 1953 to 1955 he was a Technical Officer at Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd., Welwyn Garden City. From 1955 to 1963 he was a Senior Physicist at the Natural Rubber Producers' Research Association, also in Welwyn. From 1963 to 1968 he was a Reader in Materials Science. In 1967 he set up the Department of Materials at Queen Mary College, University of London, and served both as its Head and later as Dean of Engineering (1971–1974). From 1968 to 1998 he was Professor of Materials at Queen Mary and Westfield College. Besides his work at the university, he was also a director of: QMC Industrial Research London (1970–1988), Denbyware PLC (1971–1981, non-executive director), Materials Technology Consultants Ltd (1974–present), Evangelical Press (1975–2004) and Fire and Materials Ltd (1985–1988). For five years he was a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Neste Oy, the national oil company of Finland (which later sold its chemical division and became Neste Oil). He was and remains the first president of the Biblical Creation Society, and was Editor of Evangelical Times (1998–2008). Edgar Andrews was an international consultant to the Dow Chemical Company (USA) for over thirty years and to the 3M Company (USA) for twenty years. He also acted for many years as an expert scientific witness in a variety of cases in the British High Court and in courts in the US and Canada. He has published well over 100 scientific research papers and books, together with two Bible commentaries and various works on science and religion and on theology. His book From Nothing to Nature has been translated into ten languages. He is currently Co-Pastor of the Campus Church in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire.Campus Church Recognition and awards On 28–30 September 1972, Edgar Andrews was one of four speakers invited to address an international audience of over 400 scientists at the Michigan Molecular Institute's Dedication Symposium, along with Nobel Laureates Paul J. Flory and Melvin Calvin, and Professor Donald Lyman.Andrews refers to this on page 197 in his book Who made God? The four papers presented were later published in H. G. Elias's Trends in Macromolecular Science (Midland Macromolecular Monographs, vol. 1, Gordon & Breach, New York / London, 1973) and in Angewandte Chemie (Intern. Ed. 1974, vol. 13, nr. 2). The article in Angewandte Chemie can be read here. Several of his research articles have appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Britain's leading scientific journal.Articles published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society In 1977 Edgar Andrews was awarded the A. A. Griffith Medal and Prize by the Materials Science Club for contributions to materials science. The prize is now awarded by the IOM3. Creationist views Edgar Andrews is described by historian of creationism Ronald Numbers as the United Kingdom's \\"most respected creationist scientist of the late twentieth century\\", a Reformed Baptist, and a convert to Whitcomb and Morris' flood geology since the 1960s. However, Andrews rejected some elements of the latter, particularly dogmatic acceptance of a young Earth, even going so far as to suggest that the first day of creation \\"might be of indefinite length\\". However, on page 106 of his latest book Who made God?, Andrews notes – citing from his earlier work From nothing to Nature (chapter 9) – that he believes the whole universe, including the earth, was created ex-nihilo in verse 1, 'with no reference to how long ago that happened'. From verse 2 onward 'the account concentrates squarely on the earth itself'. Andrews follows E. J. Young in seeing Genesis 1:1 as describing the creation of the whole universe including the earth, with verse 2 onwards relating to the population of an 'old' earth with young features (both geographical and biological). Huxley Memorial Debate Edgar Andrews was invited by the Oxford Union Society to take part in the Huxley Memorial Debate on 16 February 1986, where he debated opposite Richard Dawkins on the motion 'That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution'. The proposer of the motion was A. E. Wilder-Smith. The opposers, Richard Dawkins and John Maynard Smith, won the debate by 198 votes to 115.John Durant, \\"Critical-Historical Perspective on the Argument about Evolution and Creation\\", in Evolution and Creation: A European Perspective (eds.

The company had provided tools for the Atari ST, Amiga, Sega Saturn, Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, Super NES, Nintendo 64, GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. History The company was founded in 1990 by Martin Day and Andy Beveridge. Both directors have backgrounds of developing game console software development tools, such as SNASM and Psy-Q, at Cross Products and later Psygnosis. SN Systems' long association with the PlayStation line of consoles began in 1993, when PlayStation manufacturer Sony acquired Psygnosis, who were publishing SN Systems' tools at the time. While Sony had provided MIPS R4000-based Sony NEWS workstations for PlayStation development, Psygnosis disliked the thought of developing on these expensive workstations and asked SN Systems to create a PC-based development system. At the 1994 Winter Consumer Electronics Show, Psygnosis arranged an audience for SN Systems with Sony's Japanese executives, and Sony were impressed enough with their development tools that they decided to abandon their plans for a workstation-based development system in favor of using SN Systems' development system exclusively. In 1999, SN Systems won a Game Developer Magazine \\"Front Line Award\\" in the Programming Environment category for its Nintendo 64 development product called SN64. The company won again in 2005, this time for the ProDG for PSP suite. SN Systems was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. in 2005, to provide tools for the PlayStation 3, and future consoles. Based in Bristol, England, they have satellite offices in Campbell, California and Dublin, Ireland. Products Central to the SN Systems product line is the ProDG suite, comprising a compiler and integration with Microsoft Visual Studio, together with a debugger and additional build tools.

He was in the news in 2013 when an anonymity order imposed in 2009 was lifted based on findings that there was a public interest in his application for parole and that there was no immediate danger to his life. He was held in a vulnerable prisoners' unit, where he spent most of his 40 years in prison until he was released on parole in December 2018. Early life David Anthony McGreavy was born in 1951 in Southport, Lancashire to Thomas and Bella McGreavy, the second of six children. His father, Thomas, was a sergeant in the British Army and the family moved frequently between different Army posts. In 1967, David McGreavy left school and joined the Royal Navy, where he hoped to make a career. However, he was dismissed from the Navy in August 1971, after being court-martialled for starting a fire that destroyed a mess wardroom. McGreavy then moved back in with his parents in Worcestershire. His fiancée broke up with him and he was sacked from several jobs. Fed up with his lack of work and heavy drinking, his parents forced him to move out. Ralph family In 1972, unable to live with his parents, McGreavy began boarding with his friend Clive Ralph and his wife Elsie (née Clay), and their two small children, Paul (born 1968) and Dawn Maria (born 1971). Clive and Elsie had been school friends, and there was a five-year age difference between them; they had married in September 1968 when Elsie was 16 and pregnant with Paul. They lived on Gillam Street in the Rainbow Hill district of Worcester. At the time McGreavy moved in, Elsie was pregnant with the Ralphs' third child, Samantha Jane, who was born in September 1972. Elsie Ralph (who later remarried and has gone by the names \\"Elsie Urry\\" or \\"Dorothy Urry\\") recalled in a television interview many years later that McGreavy held a factory job. He paid £6 per week for rent, as well as sometimes cooking Sunday dinner. Although newspapers reported in 1973 that McGreavy and Elsie had had an affair, Elsie has denied this. Clive Ralph worked for his father as a lorry driver. When baby Samantha was about 7 months old, Elsie became a barmaid at The Punch Bowl tavern, about from the Ralph home. With both Clive and Elsie now busy working, McGreavy acted as babysitter for the Ralph children. At that time, McGreavy's family and neighbours as well as the Ralphs knew him as a person who loved children, including the Ralph children. According to Elsie, he would frequently play with her children and acted \\"like a father\\" to them, going so far as to chastise her over her discipline of Paul. Murders On Friday, 13 April 1973, Elsie Ralph was picked up from work by Clive, who had left home late, with the children all asleep. Clive would usually pick her up late in order to help her with closing, and to have a last pint. When the Ralphs arrived at their home, the police were already there and escorted them to the police station, where they were told of their children's murder. McGreavy, who was known to be an habitual drinker with a violent temper when intoxicated, had gone to the Buck's Hill pub earlier that evening with a friend, where he drank five to seven pints of beer. The two men had played cards and darts, though a small altercation took place prior to leaving the pub, after McGreavy had put a cigarette out in his friend's beer. Clive had picked McGreavy up from the Buck's Hill and brought him home to look after the children while Clive went to get Elsie from work. Some time between 10:15 and 11:15pm, a drunk McGreavy became infuriated with the Ralph children, beginning with the baby, Samantha, who had been crying for her bottle. McGreavy violently killed Samantha and then the other two children, each in a different manner. Eight-month-old Samantha died from a skull fracture, 2-year- old Dawn had her throat slit and 4-year-old Paul was strangled. After killing the three children, McGreavy went down to the basement and retrieved a pickaxe. He further mutilated their bodies with the pickaxe before impaling the three bodies on the spikes of a wrought iron fence in a neighbour's yard. He then left the home. McGreavy was arrested by police at 3:50am, walking on a street near the Ralphs' home. Upon his arrest, McGreavy reportedly said, \\"What's this all about?\\" At first, McGreavy denied any responsibility, but, several hours later said, \\"It was me, but, it wasn’t me,\\" after which he described in graphic detail what he had done. He told police, \\"I put my hand over her (Samantha's) mouth, and it went from there. It's all in the house. On Paul, I used a wire. I was going to bury him, but I couldn't. I went outside, and put them on the fence. All I could hear is kids, kids, kids.\\" McGreavy's only explanation for the murders was that the baby would not stop crying. On 28 June 1973, McGreavy appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the murders of all three Ralph children. The hearing lasted only eight minutes because McGreavy pleaded guilty and there was no defence plea, no motive, and no case of diminished responsibility. Prison McGreavy was sentenced to multiple life terms with minimums of 20 years. In prison he was subjected to frequent abuse by other prisoners and spent most of his 45 years behind bars in protected conditions. He was reported to have successfully adjusted, accepted rehabilitation and engaged in painting. Publicity and 2009 anonymity order Due to the brutality of the crime, McGreavy became known as the \\"Monster of Worcester\\" and was the subject of substantial press coverage at the time of the crime. Former editor of the Sunday Mirror Paul Connew was a reporter at the time and had covered the story. Connew has opined that although people remembered the crime, the name of David McGreavy was not well remembered because of the lack of a lengthy court proceeding with the accompanying coverage. In 2006, McGreavy again became headline news after he was transferred to an open prison and allowed to stay in a bail hostel in Liverpool. The Sun newspaper discovered and publicised this arrangement, featuring a front-page photo of McGreavy (released on temporary licence) walking on a Liverpool street, which resulted in McGreavy's transfer back to a closed prison. In 2009, an anonymity order was issued by the High Court of Justice during McGreavy's parole board proceedings. The order was resisted by the British press and the Press Association, supported by the Secretary of State for Justice, who argued that setting such a precedent would prevent coverage of dangerous criminals. The order was lifted on 21 May 2013 by Lord Justice Pitchford of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales and Mr Justice Simon of the High Court of Justice, based on the importance of the public interest in possible release of a dangerous criminal and lack of imminent danger to McGreavy.Craven, Edward (May 29, 2013).\\"Case Comment: R(M) v Parole Board - No Anonymity for Convicted Child Killer\\" (containing link to High Court published opinion). inforrm.wordpress.com.

Career He founded and directed the Simonton Cancer Center (SCC) in Malibu (USA) and was one of the pioneers of psycho-oncology. For over 30 years he worked with cancer patients who wanted to actively support their recovery process. Key elements of his philosophy and techniques affect the practical consulting work in the psycho-oncology in the United States, Europe and Japan. Criticism Simonton was the author of the book Getting Well Again (1992). He claimed that cancer can be treated by relaxation and visualization techniques and that patients were healed using his methods. However, an investigation into five of his most impressive cases discovered that some of his patients had undergone standard treatment or probably did not have cancer to begin with.Friedlander, Edward R.

It specialises in products which offer certified burglary protection and/or fire protection. The brand is widely sold and marketed in the UK, South Africa, India and Malaysia as well as parts of northern Europe and east Asia. Chubbsafes is owned under licence by the Gunnebo Security Group.  History  Early Years: 1818-1938 In 1818, Charles Chubb and his younger brother, Jeremiah Chubb, founded the Chubb Company and opened a workshop for making locks on Temple Street in Wolverhampton, England. Two years later, they opened a shop at 57 St.Paul's Churchyard in London. In 1835, Charles Chubb expanded the business and took out a patent for a burglary-resistant safe. A safe works was opened shortly afterwards, in 1837, in London and in 1839 the brothers patented their first fire safe. Following the death of Charles, the company remained in the family, being taken over by his son, John Chubb, in 1846, and then his grandchildren, John Charles, George Hayter and Harry Withers Chubb in 1872. In 1882, the business became a private limited company and changed its name to Chubb & Sons Lock and Safe Company Ltd. The London safe works moved to Wednesfield Road in Wolverhampton in 1908 and when the site was extended in 1938, it was joined by the lock works. Expansion: 1950s-1990s On 31 January 1950 a celebratory dinner was held at the Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg South Africa. The event was the inauguration of Mr F.M.W Petersen Director Austen Petersen Safe Company of South Africa with Chubb & Sons Lock and Safe Company of Great Britain. The first overseas factory opened in South Africa in 1950 which was followed by a second offshore plant, this time in Canada, four years later. Over the coming years, the Chubb Company made several acquisitions and was later acquired itself. Hobbs Hart & Co Ltd became a member of the Chubb Group in 1956, Chatwood-Milner Ltd in 1958 and Josiah Parkes & Sons (Holdings) Limited in 1965. The Racal Electronics Group then acquired Chubb & Sons Lock and Safe Company in 1984 and before US company, Williams Holdings, took it over in 1997. 2000 – present Day In 2000, the safes part of the company and a licence for the Chubbsafes brand was acquired by the Gunnebo Security Group. Since then, Chubbsafes has been introduced to new markets including China, Indonesia, Sweden, Germany and France.  Products   Safes  Safes are sold from Grade I to Grade VI, rising in the level of physical attack the safe will withstand. A grade is always awarded by an independent body (European Certification Body).  Fire Safes  Safes are also sold which withstand fire. These are independently certified for the length of protection (half an hour, one hour or two hours) and the type of contents which will be protected (either paper or data). The range includes document safes, data safes and fireproof filing cabinets.  Vault Rooms  With grades up to XII, vault rooms and vault doors are used not only by banks, but also companies which need to protect the contents of a specific area, such as a weapons room or storage of pharmaceuticals.

In 2019, Martin was featured in an exhibition at the Denver Art Museum, which showed her iconic black-and-white drawings on the museum's walls, floors and ceilings all over the building. The exhibition explored the concepts of intersectionality, identity and play. Martin's drawings in the museum were swapped in and out throughout the length of the exhibition, making it fluid and different on each visit.  Collaborations  In 2016, Martin collaborated with Kendrick Lamar for a 75-minute performance at Art Basel in Miami. She worked with Puma for three separate collaborations, PUMA x SHANTELL MARTIN. In 2018, for her third collaboration, Puma staged a pop-up on Canal Street in New York City. \\\\- She has also collaborated with Tiffany & Co., Vespa and 1800 Tequila, as part of the tequila company's \\"Essential Artists\\" series.

The MAC-16 (or LEC-16) was a 16-bit minicomputer introduced in 1969 by Lockheed Electronics. One main selling point of the MAC-16 was a dedicated context switching system that completed operations in two machine cycles. Several improved versions were introduced, including the MAC Jr., Sue, and System III, but the company dropped support for all of these in the late 1970s. The MAC-16 was designed to support various high-performance military and civilian roles, and thus spent a considerable amount of time on guaranteeing high speed context switching to support real-time computing. A switch to and from an interrupt handler took only 2 cycles. The original MAC-16 operated with a 1 μS cycle time using core memory and TTL integrated circuits. Lockheed advertised the machine with the slogan \\"In by 12:34:45.000000, out by 12:34:45.000002\\". The system featured 64 interrupt levels, allowing considerable flexibility in software design. Like any machine based on a 16-bit instruction register, the original MAC-16 was able to address up to 64 kilo-words (kW, 128 kB) of RAM. At the time, RAM was provided in the form of hand-wired core memory, which cost about $1 per word. Most MAC-16 machines thus featured considerably less than 64 kW, and 8 kW systems were common as this was all that was needed to support a Fortran compiler. Third-party memory expansion products were available for about half the cost of the Lockheed parts.\\"CMI Offers Add-On For Lockheed Mini\\", Computerworld, 28 August 1974, p. 21. One well-known role for the MAC-16 was Lockheed's winning entry for the Federal Aviation Administration's \\"ARTS II\\" air-traffic control system. The original ARTS (Automated Radar Terminal System) was based on Univac mainframe computers, which were tube-based systems of enormous size and cost, far too expensive to be used at smaller airports. ARTS II was introduced to address the needs for smaller airports. Lockheed's entry was based on the MAC-16 and a large display system delivered by Plessey, providing on-screen symbology and altitude data for up to 256 aircraft. Ironically, after Lockheed won the ARTS II contest, Burroughs underbid Lockheed, and the ARTS II was based on Burroughs systems.Michael Nolan, \\"Fundamentals of Air Traffic Control\\", Cengage Learning, 2010, pp. 370-371 MAC-16s were found in numerous other roles, including the control systems for the Fermilab accelerators.HR Barton Jr, \\"Network Aspects of the Fermilab Control System\\", Fermilab, 1977 References ;Citations ;Bibliography * David Smith, \\"The Lockheed Electronics Company MAC16\\", Georgia Tech * MAC, \\"MAC 16\\", Lockheed Electronics, 1970 External links * Old- engineering.tumblr.com: \\"Funny, it doesn't look like a Lockheed.\\" — Lockheed advertisement for the MAC-16.

The 1888 club, William O'Brien's GFC, named after Land League agitator and nationalist MP William O'Brien (1852–1928), was affected by the political rifts that followed the death of Parnell in 1891, and the name William O'Brien's was dropped.

It includes the Sihlwald forest, the largest mixed deciduous and coniferous forest in the Swiss Mittelland, and the Langenberg Wildlife Park, the oldest Swiss wildlife park. Both sites are situated in the Sihl Valley to the south of Zürich, but are separated from each other by the town of Langnau am Albis.  History  The Sihlwald The city of Zürich received the Sihl forest, or Sihlwald, as a gift in 1309 from the Hapsburgers and again in 1524 through the dissolution of the Fraumünster convent. Over the following centuries, the forest provided Zürich with timber and firewood. However, the trees have not been felled since the 1990s; this is due to the actions of forest director Andreas Speich, in order to preserve the forest's unique composition. In 1869, Langenberg Wildlife Park was founded by the city forester Carl Anton Ludwig von Orelli. On August 28, 2009, the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) declared the Sihl forest a \\"regional nature park of national importance\\". The protection of Sihl forest was established through a forest reserve agreement in 2007 and a cantonal Protection Ordinance in 2008. The Zürich Wilderness Park was formed in 2009, by the merger of the Langenberg Wildlife Park and the Sihlwald forest. Today, the park welcomes more than half a million yearly visitors, who are encouraged to barbecue, hike, cycle, and even ride horseback through the park, as well as visit its museum and attend various outdoor events.  Sites  The Langenberg Wildlife Park The Zürich Wilderness Park comprises two disconnected sites: * The Langenberg Wildlife Park, a zoo situated in the municipality of Langnau am Albis some south of Zürich. Langenberg is home to a zoo with 16 native or formerly native animals such as bears, beavers, elk, hare, lynxes, wild boar, wolves, European bison and Przewalski’s horse. * The Sihlwald forest, largely situated in the municipality of Horgen but also spreading into several adjoining municipalities. It is situated on both banks of the Sihl river, although mostly on the western slopes rising up to the Albis hills. The forest covers approximately and is between and south of Zürich. It is the only Swiss peri- urban nature reserve, and consists of mostly beech trees, some of which are up to 250 years old. The majority of the trees are about 120 years old. Both sites can be reached via rail service S4 of the Zurich S-Bahn, using Wildpark- Höfli station for the Langenberg Wildlife Park and Sihlwald station for the Sihlwald forest.

The region was strategically important as a supply route for rebels fighting Syrian government forces in Homs and also for the Syrian government, as it lies between the capital, Damascus, and the Syrian coast, a stronghold for Assad supporters. Prior to the offensive, the Syrian Air Force dropped leaflets over the town warning that government forces were going to attack the city. This led to thousands of civilians fleeing, though 25,000 residents stayed. Free Syrian Army (FSA) General Salim Idris warned of a \\"massacre\\" if the Syrian Army and Hezbollah were to take the town. During the final days of the battle Hezbollah forces and rebels negotiated a withdrawal plan, in which the rebels and civilians could evacuate the town through a narrow corridor without being attacked. On 5 June, after two weeks of fighting, the Syrian Army and Hezbollah regained control of al-Qusayr as the last rebel contingents retreated. One observer described the battle as the \\"defining battle of the country's civil war.\\" The battle First week US Army report on the battle. On 19 May, after two days of calm, planes, artillery and mortars bombarded al-Qusayr in the early hours of the morning killing 20 people, including 11 rebels. Later in the day, government troops, backed-up by hundreds of Hezbollah militiamen, stormed the city from several directions. Fierce fighting raged around the entrances to the town. Helicopters were seen bombing a heavily damaged neighbourhood in video uploaded onto the Web. Clashes at nine points in and around al-Qusayr were reported during the day. Syrian troops entered the center of the city later in the day, seizing the town's main square and its municipality building, a military source said. One opposition activist denied that government forces made gains and stated that the municipality building had already been destroyed six months earlier. He also reported that 17 houses had been destroyed in the early morning bombardment. However, another opposition activist at the end of the day confirmed the Army had captured the municipality building and were in control of 60% of the city. Government troops had attacked from the south, east and northeast. According to one soldier, after fierce fighting they quickly seized the southern part of town, the town hall and nearby buildings, and advanced on the western outskirts. During the operation, troops had to defuse mines and bombs placed by rebels at the entrances to the city. The attack appeared to surprise the rebels, who expected the Army to push via the north by attacking several rebel-controlled villages before attacking the city itself. Hezbollah fighters had descended on the city from the Al Tal area, west of the Assi river, which has an overlooking position over al-Qusayr. Several rebel fighters accused some commanders of fleeing the Al Tal area after they bought their way out of al-Qusayr at the last moment before the assault on the city started. Many fighters reportedly managed to break the siege by escaping through a secret route towards Josiah and the Qalamoun Mountains to the south. However, government troops apparently found out about the escape route nearly a week before and blocked it, killing and injuring around 30 fighters. According to the FSA, the commander of Hezbollah's forces leading the battle in al-Qusayr is Mustafa Badreddine, who is accused of involvement in former Lebanese premier Rafik Hariri's murder. “It has been confirmed that Mustafa Badreddine is present on Qusayr's front where he is leading Hizbullah's operations,” said a statement issued by the FSA.FSA: Mustafa Badreddine Leading Hizbullah Operations in Qusayr Naharnet, 20 May 2013 A Hezbollah fighter reported that their forces managed to clear two-thirds of the city and were moving towards the northern section of al-Qusayr when they were attacked from behind by rebel fighters, which they had not previously seen. At that point they suffered a lot of casualties, most of them shot in the back. Later, in an analysis by AP, it was determined that government forces had captured more than half the city within hours of the start of the battle, primarily the southern and eastern parts of al-Qusayr. Rebels remained entrenched in the northern and western parts of the town.A look at the fighting in Syria's town of Qusair By the second day of the battle, state media claimed they had restored \\"stability\\" in the town's east, and was still hunting \\"remnants of terrorists\\" in some northern and eastern areas. The areas listed by them as coming under Army control were: \\"The local stadium area; some parts of the western area, municipality HQ, the cultural centre, the Church, al-Baladyeh roundabout and al-Ghytta area.\\" An opposition source also reported the fighting to be concentrated in the northern part of the city. SOHR reported the Army surrounded the village of al-Dab'a, north of the city. SOHR said there were conflicting reports as to whether or not the Syrian army was fighting inside al-Qusayr city, but had reports which confirmed that they were gathering near the western neighborhood of al-Qusayr \\"in order to lay siege on the city itself\\". Thick black smoke could also be seen from the direction of that air base, north of the city, as government troops fought to retake the facility. An activist claimed that government and Hezbollah forces had been pushed back to their starting positions on the outskirts of the city, while an FSA spokesman claimed that the government force's efforts to enter the city were being blocked by the FSA, and accused the Syrian army of using a scorched-earth policy during the battle. At the same time, another opposition activist once again reaffirmed that government forces had captured the municipality building and the city center and had pushed out rebel units out of most of al-Qusayr. An Al Jazeera reporter in Beirut also said that it seemed that the Army had control of most of the town. On the third day of the fighting, elite Hezbollah reinforcements were sent from Lebanon across the border to al-Qusayr. SOHR reported that much of the town had been destroyed by this point. SOHR had also confirmed, for itself, for the first time that fighting was raging in the city itself. Hezbollah fighters were no longer being used as conventional soldiers, instead they are breaking up into small groups and being used in a \\"guerrilla warfare\\" role against the rebels for which they were trained. A US State Department official, citing multiple rebel sources, claimed that Iranian soldiers were involved in the battle for al- Qusayr, whether they are fighting or not remains unclear. On 22 May, George Sabra, president of the SNC, issued a call for reinforcements to be sent to al-Quasyr stating \\"Everyone who has weapons or ammunition should send them to Qusair and Homs to strengthen its resistance\\". The Islamic Tawheed Brigade reportedly sent a convoy of 30 vehicles to al-Quasyr from Aleppo. Later, Abu Firas of the Tawid brigade claimed that a total of 300 support units arrived in al-Qusayr, adding that they also sent an ambulance, an antiaircraft weapon and ammunition. SOHR reported that rebel reinforcements from the town of Ind Shamseen, who were trying to reach al-Qusayr, were ambushed by government forces and two rebels were killed. Days later, an opposition activist denied any reinforcements had arrived in al-Qusayr, stating that \\"No one is helping Qusair other than its own men\\". One rebel source said government and Hezbollah forces had cut most of the oppositions overland supply lines into al-Qusayr and some others reaffirmed that they believe government troops had captured about 60 percent of the city, while a government official claimed they controlled up to 80 percent of the city. Rebel sources reported the Army was holding 40% of the city, with opposition forces still in control of the central and western part of al-Qusayr. Government troops were advancing cautiously amid heavy fighting which largely destroyed the city. Morale among Army personal was reportedly high as \\"news broke\\" about the killing of al- Nusra Front commander Abu Omar. Military commanders on the ground said that the battle for Qusayr is far from over and it could take one more week to retake the northern part of al-Qusayr where rebels were entrenched. Meanwhile, opposition forces were still holding the al-Dabaa air base. It was reported that the Army had discovered rebel tunnels linking areas around the town. Morale was also high among Hezbollah fighters, despite losing a large number of men. On 24 May, rebels launched a counter-attack in which they claimed to had recaptured three posts from the Syrian Army and Hezbollah fighters. SOHR reported that two rebels were killed. Rebel forces in al-Qusayr were joined by the ‘cannibal’ commander, Abu Sakkar, who became notorious after appearing in a video in which he ate the heart of a dead government soldier. It was also reported, according to pro-government sources, that Army forces were advancing in the nearby town of Hamidiya, in an attempt to cut the opposition forces' last supply line into al-Qusayr. Opposition sources denied this with an FSA major claiming the attack on the city via Hamidiya was repulsed. However, SOHR said that fighting in Hamidiya was still ongoing. An AFP journalist said the eastern part of the city was transformed into a military barracks. A military officer told the journalist that the Army was in the penultimate phase of the battle. According to SOHR, the Army and Hezbollah were encircling and bombing the rebels in the northern part of the town, into which government forces were squeezing opposition fighters, as stated by a military officer. Another officer stated that the rebels were confined in a triangle linking Arjun, al- Dabaa and the northern part of al-Qusayr. A large force of rebels had retreated to the al-Dabaa air base. The approach of the Army was described as being slow and methodical, taking over small bit of ground from rebels and consolidating it before advancing again. Very few reinforcements reached the rebels, due to the control of surrounding roads by the government. This was reaffirmed when one opposition activist in fact said that no reinforcements had arrived into al-Qusayr at all. At daybreak on 25 May, the Army unleashed the heaviest shelling since the start of the battle with barrages of rockets and tank shells hitting al-Qusayr and the surrounding rebel areas, specifically Hamdiyeh and the al-Dabaa airbase to the north.Qusayr battle rages as Syria regime presses assault The barrage lasted for six to seven hours with an average of 40 shells per minute hitting the town.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/05/201352621316268311.html Battle for Syria's Qusayr intensifies 26 May 2013 Government forces also fired two surface to surface missiles during the bombardment.Syria rebels fight on as peace talks pressure mounts According to military sources and state media, the Army launched a three-pronged attack on the town which was advancing well and resulting in heavy losses for the rebels. A Hezbollah fighter told Reuters that the attack was advancing slowly due to rebel efforts at mining the town, with the fighter saying \\"Even the refrigerators are mined.\\" Government and Hezbollah forces had also reportedly breached rebel defence lines at the al- Dabaa air base from the northwest and entered the facility where fighting was ongoing, according to the Army. SOHR reported that the fighting was taking place around the base, while rebels were still maintaining control of it, though it was being heavily shelled by government forces. Among the weapons being used were also multiple rocket launchers. SOHR said \\"the intensification of the fighting can be explained by Hezbollah's desire to score points before the speech their leader Hassan Nasrallah is due to deliver this evening,\\" marking the 13th anniversary of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon.Qusayr battle rages as Syria regime presses assault The Syrian rebels have repeatedly warned that they will hit Hezbollah targets on Lebanese territory if the latter does not withdraw from Syria and have called on the Lebanese government to put a stop to Hezbollah intervention. According to SOHR's head Rami Abdul Rahman, it was their belief that government forces were in control of much of the city and were intensifying their attacks on the air base, despite rebel claims of being able to repel Army and Hezbollah attacks on al-Qusayr. A Hezbollah source said, at this point, Army and Hezbollah forces were in control of 80 percent of the city after capturing 10 percent during the day. He also claimed that the road between Baalbek in Lebanon and Homs city was secured. Second week On 27 May, Yara Abbas, a Syrian female TV reporter was killed by rebel sniper fire while covering the fighting at the air base, north of al-Qusayr. Army and Hezbollah troops captured the town of Hamidiya after heavy clashes. The fighting than shifted to the village of Haret al-Turkumen, which the Army was trying to capture in order to put al-Qusayr under \\"complete siege.\\" An opposition activist said that government forces had captured two-thirds of the city, while another activist said the Army was preventing rebel reinforcements from reaching al-Qusayr. The reinforcements, who were trying to relieve the pressure on al-Qusayr, were bogged down on the outskirts of the city and one activist said the following about them, \\"So far they are just fighting and dying, their assault hasn't resulted in much yet unfortunately\\".Syria fighting rages amid reports of chemical attacks On 28 May, recent videos posted by rebels suggested that Hezbollah's and the Syrian Army's forces were tied up in the eastern part of the city and on the outskirts. A rebel spokesman from within the city claimed government forces captured 20% of the city, consisting of the security buildings in the eastern part, while rebels were holding the rest. The spokesperson added that for the first time a gap in Hezbollah's encirclement of the town had opened up, allowing them to evacuate several hundred non-combatants. Rami Abdul Rahman of SOHR told Al Jazeera the latest reinforcements “indicate that the regime is gearing for a major offensive on neighborhoods in the north and west of the town still under rebel control.\\" Top rebel general Salim Idris stated that if the European Union did not provide new weapons shipments to the opposition forces his fighters could lose control of al-Qusayr in the coming days and said rebel forces in the city were outnumbered by more than 3 to 1. On 29 May, Syrian Air Force launched six air raids against sections of the town still controlled by the rebels. The government has reinforced the assault on the town with elite Republican Guards and Hezbollah has committed extra fighters. In what, according to SOHR, appears to be the beginning of a major assault on the town. Lebanese Sunni fighters are also reported as having crossed the border into Syrian to fight alongside the rebels in Qusayr.https://now.mmedia.me/lb/en/nowsyrialatestnews/syria-troops-hezbollah- bolster-al-qusayr-fighters-activists-say Syria troops, Hezbollah bolster Al- Qusayr fighters, activists say 29 May 2013 A convoy of up to 40 tanks and 40 technicals was seen heading to Qusayr from Damascus, though with rebels trying to block the convoy.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/05/2013529105510937115.html Syria and Hezbollah bolster forces in Qusayr 29 May 2013 Meanwhile, air strikes were conducted against a convoy of rebel vehicles trying to reach the city, killing eight rebels. A rebel doctor reported four incidents involving the deployment of chemicals that \\"made breathing difficult.\\" Government forces had launched 10 air strikes on Qusayr and the nearby villages of Hamidiya. 3 Missiles were also fired at Qusayr which could, according to one fighter, \\"bring down a whole street.\\" http://www.voanews.com/content/syria- hezbollah/1671127.html Ferocious Battle Underway Over Syrian Border City 29 May 2013 State media reported that government troops had captured the air base after five hours of fighting in and around it. Hezbollah's Manar TV aired footage, relayed from its TV crew embedded with government troops, of tanks being deployed inside the air base and soldiers walking around empty hangars. Syrian Army forces were then reportedly advancing on the nearby town of Dabaa. SOHR and a spokesman for the rebel Farouq Battalions confirmed the capture of the air base the next day. A Hezbollah fighter, who left the battle four days prior but stayed in touch with developments and was expected to return, said the group had cleared rebels from most of al-Qusayr and the Farouq spokesman confirmed the assertion. He was quoted as saying, “We have suffered heavy losses”. According to the Hezbollah member, the city was divided on a grid into 16 squares, of which they had captured 13. On 30 May, rebels confirmed that al-Qusayr was totally surrounded as they were unable to evacuate their wounded who reportedly numbered 700, 100 of whom were on oxygen. They requested medical and military aid. A rebel statement was issued saying that \\"If all rebel fronts do not move to stop this crime ... we will soon be saying that there was once a city called Qusair\\". Several YouTube videos showed that some brigades of rebel reinforcements made it to the outskirts of the town but failed, as with previous efforts, to enter al- Qusayr.https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/30/us-syria-crisis-qusair- idUSBRE94T09120130530 Syrian rebels plead for help as army bombards strategic Qusair 30 May 2013 Artillery shells were landing every minute on the city, while Syrian Army and Hezbollah forces seemed to be advancing more quickly after seizing the nearby air base. SOHR reported clashes near the villages of Shamsi and A'rjoun villages. Later, state media said that government troops had captured A'rjoun, thus leaving rebels in a situation with little chance of escaping from the northern part of al-Qusayr. Reuters also reported on the capture of the village, which is six kilometers to the northwest of the city. On 31 May, George Sabra claimed that over 1,000 rebel fighters moved into al- Qusayr to join those fighting in the town even though it remained completely encircled by Hezbollah and government forces. However, SOHR and an opposition activist inside the city stated the number was far fewer than 1,000, instead they were numbering just several hundred fighters. The next day, rebel Gen. Idris stated that, in all, 300 rebels managed to reinforce al-Qusayr. 11 rebels were killed during the attempt to break through Army lines near the village of Shamsinn. Al-Tawhid Brigade announced on its Facebook page that it had sent \\"hundreds\\" of fighters through army lines to the north-east of al- Qusayr. It remained unclear whether or not the fresh influx of rebel fighters was enough to help the opposition regain some lost ground, according to SOHR. Idris stated that rebels in the city were \\"heavily outgunned and overwhelmed\\" by government forces and warned of defeat if the West did not react to help them. A doctor north of al-Qusayr claimed that rebels were holding 80 percent of the city, although this could not be independently verified, while Reuters said that government forces had captured two-thirds of the city, but that rebels were still holding out in the central part of al-Qusayr. Idris claimed that more than 7,000 Hezbollah fighters were near al-Qusayr. Although that claim seemed unlikely because that would involve most of Hezbollah's military wing and they would be pulling their troops from the southern Lebanon border with Israel. A doctor in the town reported as seeing \\"many\\" bodies of Hezbollah fighters. A doctor, Muhammad al-Muhammad, stated that the involvement of Hezbollah \\"definitely changed the game\\" as other sides have been drained by two years of fighting.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle- east-22728170 Syrian doctor describes 'oppression' in besieged Qusair 31 May 2013 The Syrian Army attacked a convoy trying to remove injured people from the town killing 7–9 and wounding 80. 15,000 civilians remained trapped in the town with food and water running low. Civilians had to wait 3–4 days for drinking water. Some civilians were able to get out but they have had to pay \\"enormous bribes\\" to get out of the town. A doctor, based north of al-Qusayr, described how the FSA were \\"just unable to control the situation here\\". He also said, \\"The battle is getting bad. There are kids and women that are dying in the battle for more control.\\" A Hezbollah commander claimed that the tactics and weapons used against them were the same as those that Hezbollah used in the past. Later during the day, state TV reported that government troops captured the village of Jawadiyeh outside al-Qusayr, closing all entrances leading to the town and tightening the government's siege.Balance Of Power In Syria Shifting Assad's Way The capture was confirmed by SOHR. On 1 June, rebels tried to launch an attack against the al-Dabaa air base, while clashes occurred in Dabaa village. At least 15 government tanks were seen massing at points north of the town including the airport and Jawadiya. Third week On 2 June, the Syrian Air Force launched six air raids against rebel-held parts of the town, according to activists. The International Red Cross asked for a cease-fire to allow for the evacuation of wounded and civilians. If possible, to also allow aid in for the civilians who remained behind. A number of UN agencies also expressed concern about the civilians in the town. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay stated there was \\"an urgent need of immediate evacuation for emergency medical treatment\\". The UN Security Council debated a draft motion that mentioned \\"grave concern about the situation in Qusayr...[and] the impact on civilians of the ongoing fighting\\". Russia vetoed the motion on the basis that the UN Security Council \\"did not speak out when the rebels seized the town in 2012\\". The UN believes that 1,500 wounded needed immediate emergency evacuation.Car bombing in Damascus kills nine 2 June 2013 Car bombing in Damascus kills nine According to AP, wounded are treated in private homes after the main hospital was destroyed and a previous evacuation effort foundered after a convoy was attacked killing 13 of the wounded. Meanwhile, more government reinforcements were reportedly continuing to flow towards their lines.28 Syrian rebels killed in assault on village: NGO The Syrian government confirmed that it will allow the International Red Cross access to the town however only \\"immediately after the end of military operations\\", stated Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem. According to an opposition activist, Hezbollah forces cut off running water in the city after they captured the water station. Hezbollah introduced a change to its rotation policy for its fighters in al-Qusayr from 7 days of fighting followed by 7 days leave, increasing it to 20 days fighting and then 7 days leave. Rebels also attempted diversionary raids on government positions north of Homs city, near Rastan, but they were beaten back with heavy losses such as in the Alawite town of Kafr Nan where 28 rebels were killed. Rebels were trying to create a second front by launching probing attacks. On 3 June, rebel activists claimed a new attempt to advance by government forces was repulsed, resulting in the destruction of three tanks and the death of \\"dozens\\" of government soldiers. Rebel commander Col. Abduljabbar Akidi, head of the Aleppo Military Council, managed to infiltrate the city and Abdulqader Saleh, commander of the Tawhid Brigade, was en route to the town. Three surface-to- surface missiles were fired at the town by government troops. Fighting was still ongoing in the village of Dabaa, which was largely government- controlled, and the rebel-controlled village of Jouadiyah. Activists reaffirmed government control of the villages of Borak and Arjoun. The number of injured who need medical assistance has risen to 1,000 according to a doctor, Kassem Al Zein, in the town. He further claimed that more than 200 had been killed and there was no time to bury the deceased leading to a terrible smell in the town. The doctor asked for outside assistance from humanitarian agencies claiming that \\"We have lost everything.\\" Those in Qusayr have not attempted another convoy to evacuate the wounded due to the previous convoy being attacked resulting in the death of 13 of people who were already seriously injured. At least 300 seriously wounded locals need medical evacuation. The main hospital was destroyed several days ago and now the wounded are being treated in private homes. There is no more oxygen, and they are running out of antibiotics, bandages and anesthetics blood also needs to be donated more than once a day because no working refrigerators exist to keep blood in a usable state. Government and Hezbollah forces were advancing and getting closer to a makeshift hospital in the center of the city, which replaced the city's main hospital after it was destroyed early in the battle.Syrian Army Advances In Qusair And Damascus Suburb Government troops had built platforms on the Orontes river to quicken the movement of their troops. According to one rebel, it was their view that the Army and Hezbollah were going to make an attempt to storm the remaining rebel stronghold of northern al-Qusayr at the end of the week. At the end of the day, Lebanon's al-Manar TV, owned by Hezbollah, reported government forces had captured the south-western parts of the town. Heavy government shelling forced rebels to retreat from parts of Al-Qusayr, according to a rebel commander, Oraba Idris, and had captured as much as 50% of the city. SOHR also reported that government troops captured the local government building in the city center. The Syrian Army regained control of the city on 5 June. The rebels stated that they had pulled out of the city. One Hezbollah fighter said that they took the town in a rapid overnight offensive, allowing some of the rebels to retreat. A source close to the Syrian military said that the Army was carrying out mop-up operations in the northern quarter of al-Qusayr. The rebels had reportedly retreated north to the village of Dabaa, which was still partially under rebel control. The rebel retreat, on the evening of 4 June, was reportedly part of an informal understanding that they would be allowed safe passage by the government forces. That enabled the Army and Hezbollah to advance into the city without resistance the next morning. On 6 June, government forces continued attacking the rebel-controlled villages of Dabaa and Eastern Bweida in which at least 15 rebels were killed, according to SOHR. Mopping-up operations dealing with the \\"final pockets\\" of rebels were still occurring in al-Qusayr.Syrian army hunts down rebels north of Qusayr, NGO says Rebel commander Colonel Abdul Jabbar al-Oqaidi, who was leading a convoy of reinforcements from Aleppo to Qusayr, commented that the firepower used by the Syrian government “...was overwhelming.

According to the Syrian government, 1,257 rebels were killed, 1,192 were wounded and 1,000 were captured. Foreign rebel fighters were killed as well, including 30 Lebanese, six Palestinians and one Bahraini. Many rebel commanders were also among the dead. 114 Hezbollah fighters were killed in the fighting, 100 of them by day 11 of the battle. Among the Hezbollah members killed was commander Fadi al-Jazar, as well as Hezbollah leader's brother Khader Nasrallah.Hezbollah leader’s brother killed in Syria clashes The Times of Israel, 18 June 2013 12 government soldiers and militiamen were reported killed on the first day of the battle and another 11 were killed and 25 wounded during the last day. Refugees who fled to Arsal in Lebanon, later described their ordeal to be horrific. Several accounts were recorded mentioning the cases of families being killed by Hezbollah forces, and their money and possessions stolen. A number of testimonies indicated targeting of families by government forces who refused to leave their homes. Strategic significance The battle for Qusayr was considered by both sides in the conflict to be critical. For the Syrian government and Hezbollah, the capture of al-Qusayr allowed the Syrian government to link Homs to Damascus, reinforcing Homs and connecting Army forces to the Mediterranean coast and the port of Tartous. For Hezbollah this was about protecting their assets and supporters in Lebanon from rebel attacks. For the rebels, al-Qusayr was a major supply route for both supplies from Lebanon and Lebanese Sunni fighters who cross the border to fight alongside the rebels in Syria. In the past rebels also used this route to cross into Lebanon to avoid government forces, and used Lebanon as a base to trade fire with government soldiers.Syria conflict: Qusair's strategic importance Rebels managed to hold on to portions of al-Qusayr for three weeks, when the government expected to crush them \\"in days\\". However, the government had more forces at its disposal, particularly given the clear support of Hezbollah in the battle. Government forces used artillery, surface-to-surface missiles and the Syrian Air Force to attack the town, and were able to replace forces that became fatigued with fresh reinforcements.Rebel resistance in Qusair defies expectations Rebel forces initially had time to prepare extensive defenses such as underground bunkers, booby traps and sniper positions.https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/fighting-syrias-town- qusair-19314549#.Ua1nrpyvOII A Look at the Fighting in Syria's Town of Qusair 3 June 2013http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/05/foreign-fighters- key-to-decisive-battle-of-qusayr.html Foreign Fighters KeyTo Decisive Battle of Qusair 31 May 2013 However, rebels were forced to divert forces from Aleppo to assist the local fighters.

Following a gender disguised woman who conquers China to save her husband, the syair has been argued to be based on historical events. Plot After years of trying, Sultan Darman Syah of Kembayat Negara and his wife have a son, whom they name Zainal Abidin. They raise him to be a devout Muslim and, at age six, Zainal Abidin is sent away to learn to read the Quran and study martial arts. Elsewhere in the kingdom, after a riot at the markets leads to the execution of a Chinese merchant, all ethnic Chinese flee the kingdom and return to China. The Chinese empress, furious at the treatment of her people, orders her seven daughters to prepare for a war against Kembayat Negara. After dreaming of a beautiful woman, the adult Zainal Abidin departs Kembayat Negara to find her. Upon arriving at an island he hears a beautiful voice reciting the Quran. Following the voice he finds that it belongs to Siti Zubaidah, daughter of the island's religious leader and former king. He is stricken by her beauty and the two are married. On their way back to Kembayat Negara Zainal Abidin helps the King of Yaman repel an enemy attack, for which he is granted the hand of Princess Sajarah in marriage. Together with his wives, Zainal Abidin returns to Kembayat Negara. Later, when the Chinese army attacks Kembayat Negara, Zainal Abidin and Sajarah are captured. The pregnant Siti Zubaidah, however, is able to escape into the woods. Giving birth there, she abandons her child and continues her journey; the child is later taken in by Siti Zubaidah's brother. Siti Zubaidah allies herself with Princess Rukiah of Yunan, who was exiled from her kingdom by invaders. The two train in martial arts and, disguising themselves as men, are able to retake Yunan. In return, Rukiah agrees to help Siti Zubaidah in a war against China. With the forces of Yunan and its allies, Siti Zubaidah – still masquerading as a man – is able to conquer China. Zainal Abidin and Siti Sajarah are released. Meanwhile, the empress and her daughters are captured and forced to convert to Islam. Zainal Abidin then marries the empress and Siti Rukiah. Siti Zubaidah removes her disguise and returns to her husband's side, becoming queen of Kembayat Negara. Manuscripts According to the Chinese-Malay literary historian Liaw Yock Fang, the earliest extant manuscript of Syair Siti Zubaidah dates to 1840 (1256 hijrah). The manuscript, numbered MS 37083, is stored at the SOAS library in London, England. There are few surviving manuscripts of the story. However, it was popular in print form, particularly in Singapore, Bombay, and Cairo. Themes and styles The plot device of a woman passing herself as a man to do war, as in Syair Siti Zubaidah, was a common one in Malay and Javanese literature, including the Pandji stories from Java and hikayat and syair from Malaya. Other examples included the Hikayat Panji Semirang, Hikayat Jauhar Manikam, and Syair Abdul Muluk. The latter work shares several plot similarities with Syair Abdul Muluk. The French literary scholar Monique Zaini-Lajoubert suggests that, as Syair Siti Zubaidah is undated, it is impossible to determine which came first. However, the Chinese- Malay literary historian Liaw Yock Fang notes that Syair Abdoel Moeloek was published in 1847, some seven years after the earliest known extant manuscript of Syair Siti Zubaidah. Malaysian literary scholar Siti Hawa Salleh writes that Syair Siti Zubaidah is one of several Malay stories which combined elements of Indian and Middle Eastern Influences, comparable to the Syair Bidasari and Syair Dandan Setia. The literary scholar G. Koster promotes a similar view, suggesting that Syair Siti Zubaidah and Syair Abdul Muluk should be considered \\"'Islamicised' Pandji romances\\". In the syair Siti Zubaidah emphasises her loyalty to her husband and God, forsaking motherly duties to continue the war. Ultimately, according to Malaysian literary scholar Barbara Watson Andaya, \\"loyalty, piety and submission to fate, even when a husband is unfaithful, earns [Siti Zubaidah] the status of consort.\\" Abdul Mutalib writes that Syair Siti Zubaidah may have been based on actual historical events; some Malaysian scholars suggest that Kembayat Negara is a representation of Champa (now part of Vietnam). Liaw is critical of such a view. The syair contains many rhyme words not found in dictionaries. The rhyming pattern is also used as a reason for not providing details of sexual encounters within the story; in one scene the author writes \\"The story will not be elaborated / for it's too difficult to find rhymes.\\" The syair does, however, draw parallels between war and sex: in one scene Zainal Abidin tells one of his Chinese captors \\"We ought to fight beneath the mosquito net / our krises and spears coax and caress.\\" Publication A transliterated version was printed in 1983. Abdul Rahman al-Ahmadi provided another edition in 1994, based mostly on Ml 727 (held at the National Library of Indonesia) and MSS 25 (held at the National Library of Malaysia). Reception Syair Siti Zubaidah has been adapted to stage, using lithographs or handwritten notes as a source of dialogue.

Located southeast of the Plaza Bolívar, it was built between 1872-1877 by President Antonio Guzmán Blanco to a design by the architect . The Salón Elíptico, opened in 1877, is topped by a golden dome. Features A scene from the Battle of Carabobo in the dome of Palacio Federal Legislativo Presenting himself as a moderniser, Antonio Guzmán Blanco promoted anticlerical policies and the introduction of contemporary infrastructure to Venezuela, in particular in Caracas. The Palacio Federal Legislativo, located to the west of Plaza Bolívar, incorporates structural cast iron. It replaced a convent on the site. The building is painted bright white and has a gilded oval-shaped dome crowning an elliptically shaped room (known as the Oval Room). The dome's ceiling has a painting by Martín Tovar y Tovar which vividly depicts the crucial Battle of Carabobo in the Venezuelan War of Independence against Spanish colonial rule. The most notable professionals of the times were commissioned to design the building: Luciano Urdaneta and Roberto Garcia handled the engineering while the architect was Juan Hurtado Manrique. The complex consists of two rectangular volumes connected by two lower sections. It encloses a courtyard with a central fountain set in a small garden inside iron railings. The two Neoclassical buildings are known as the Legislative Palace and the Federal Palace. The first, completed in 1873, became the Congress in 1958 and the National Assembly in 2000. The façade of the Legislative Palace, completed in 1877, is symmetrical in design. It has a portico at the center. The triangular pediment has a bas-relief of busts of Simón Bolívar and Antonio Guzmán Blanco. There are three columnated portals, the one in the centre presenting two caryatids representing Justice and Freedom. The building houses a number of notable paintings by Venezuelan artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries including Martín Tovar y Tovar, Antonio Herrera Toro, Tito Salas, Pedro Centeno Vallenilla and Emilio Jacinto Mauri. In addition to the dome painting of the Battle of Carabobo, the Oval Room also contains the Proceedings of the Constitutional Congress (1811–1812) which includes the handwritten version of the Declaration of Independence of Venezuela. The complex has been a National Historic Monument since 22 August 1997.

New ed. 1821. Life 1743 edition of Thomas Shaw works. He was born about in Kendal, Westmorland. From the grammar school of his native town, he went to The Queen's College, Oxford, where he took his master's degree in 1719. On entering holy orders, he was appointed chaplain to the factory at Algiers. While in north Africa he traveled through Algiers, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia in the first half of the eighteenth century. He is best known for his account of his travels, first published in Oxford in 1738 and published in a French translation in The Hague by Jean Neaulme in 1743; another translation of J. MacCarthy is published by Marlin in Paris in 1830. The preface of this edition indicates that he would have lived twelve years in Algiers (1720-1732). He became a Fellow of his college in 1727, in his absence. During his travels he made crude daily geodetic surveys from which he draws maps attached to his work. he also made use of the Roman geographer Antoninus and the 12th century Arab geographer Al Idrissi in his works. On his return, in 1733, Shaw took his doctor's degree, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1740, on the death of Henry Felton, he was nominated principal of St Edmund Hall, with which he held the Greek professorship, and the vicarage of Bramley in Hampshire, till his death in 1751. In the 19th century, his century-old work again gained favor during the French conquest of Algiers in 1830. In fact, apart from the spy mission in the vicinity of Algiers led by the engineer Vincent-Yves Boutin in 1808, it seems that the France very little information on Algeria more recent than that of Shaw. Also, the geographical and \\"sociological\\" part of his 1830 edition named Historical, statistical and topographical facts on the State of Algiers, and was used of the expeditionary army of Africa.↑ Aperçu historique, statistique et topographique sur l'État d'Alger à l'usage de l'armée expéditionnaire d'Afrique, Paris, 1830. Works The first edition of Shaw's Travels in Barbary and the Levant was printed at Oxford, in 1738. Richard Pococke commented unfavourably on parts of the work in his Description of the East (1745), and Shaw published two supplements in vindication, which were incorporated in the edition of 1757. Today Shaw is better known in France than his native England. References External links *A painting of Thomas Shaw, DD, FRS from the official site of the BBC.

Released as the second single from their 1993 album If 60's Were 90's, the song reached #3 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Background The song was written by group leader Du Kane, with the programming done by Luke Baldry at Kane's mother's house in Sussex. Like the rest of Rilly Groovy's parent album If 60's Were 90's, the song extensively samples the works of Jimi Hendrix; Rilly Groovy samples guitar from \\"Wild Thing\\", \\"Up the Road\\" and \\"Bleeding Heart\\", and bass guitar and spoken words from Jimi Plays Monterey. The sample used for the guitar solo, like the others on the album, was a multitrack solo; although the group had permission to raid Jimi Hendrix's archive and indeed did do for the song's solo, most of the album's samples were taken from CD to show how much could be done. However, Rilly Groovy's solo posed an extra challenge as the drumming used in the source solo was non-metronomic, with Mitch Mitchell starting at about 100bpm and rising to 140bpm; Baldry's response was to cut it into about 20 different chunks each on the left and right, reorder them, and then replay them across the beat. Music video A music video was produced for the song. It was shot at the now-defunct Fungus Mungus in Battersea, although since many of the samples were originally taken from Jimi Plays Monterey, so too was their corresponding video. Chart performance Rilly Groovy charted at No. 3 in the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart; on the back of this, If 60's Was 90's was re-released and peaked at No. 74 on the UK Singles Chart, and No. 5 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

The DSP consists of selecting a set of duties (assignments) for the drivers or pilots of vehicles (e.g., buses, trains, boats, or planes) involved in the transportation of passengers or goods. This very complex problem involves several constraints related to labour and company rules and also different evaluation criteria and objectives. Being able to solve this problem efficiently can have a great impact on costs and quality of service for public transportation companies. There is a large number of different rules that a feasible duty might be required to satisfy, such as *Minimum and maximum stretch duration *Minimum and maximum break duration *Minimum and maximum work duration *Minimum and maximum total duration *Maximum extra work duration *Maximum number of vehicle changes *Minimum driving duration of a particular vehicle Operations research has provided optimization models and algorithms that lead to efficient solutions for this problem. Among the most common models proposed to solve the DSP are the Set Covering and Set Partitioning Models (SPP/SCP). In the SPP model, each work piece (task) is covered by only one duty. In the SCP model, it is possible to have more than one duty covering a given work piece. In both models, the set of work pieces that needs to be covered is laid out in rows, and the set of previously defined feasible duties available for covering specific work pieces is arranged in columns. The DSP resolution, based on either of these models, is the selection of the set of feasible duties that guarantees that there is one (SPP) or more (SCP) duties covering each work piece while minimizing the total cost of the final schedule.

Its noted Neo-Byzantine church is located at 36 North Pinellas Avenue. St. Nicholas hosts an annual Epiphany celebration on January 6, in which Greek Orthodox boys aged 16 to 18 dive into Spring Bayou to retrieve a white wooden cross, said to bring the finder good luck for the year. It is the largest such event in the Western Hemisphere, with thousands in attendance. A statue of an epiphany diver is located in front of the church. Architecture The domed main church building, designed by the Eugene Brothers of Chicago, was completed in 1943. Modeled in part after the Hagia Sophia in what is now Istanbul, it melds Byzantine and Gothic Revival styles. It is a local landmark which has been featured on postcards. Noted features include 23 stained glass windows surrounding the dome depicting episodes in the life of Jesus and the saints, hand-painted by Joseph V. Llorens of Atlanta, and the sixty ton altar, made of Pentelic marble. Within the dome are three large chandeliers imported from Czechoslovakia. The altar was originally part of the Greek exhibit at the 1939 New York World's Fair. It, along with the cathedra, choir stalls, and other components were obtained with help from George Frantzis.History of Epiphany Celebration A new altar of Carrara marble was installed in 1965. The interior is richly decorated with icons, many by Greek iconographer George Saklaridis. Forty-one icons, sponsored by various members of the parish, were delivered in 1952, with more added in subsequent years. On December 4, 1969, the icon of Saint Nicholas was observed to have drops of moisture, and some consider it a Weeping Icon.Spiritual Florida; A Guide to retreat centers page 56 History The community traces its history to John Cocoris, a native of Leonidio in Arcadia, Greece, who settled in the area in 1896 and became a prosperous sponge diver and trader. The trade attracted Greek immigrants as well as Greeks from other parts of the U.S. By 1907, the population was large enough to support a Greek Orthodox church, a project put under the supervision of Nicholas Peppas, a native of Aegina. The first church, completed that year at a cost of $300 for the land and $3,500 for construction, was a wood frame structure painted white. Rev. Stamatis Koutouzis was appointed the first parish priest. The parish added a school in 1925. By 1935, the parish had outgrown the first church and began raising funds toward current structure. Construction began in 1941 and was completed in 1943, when it was consecrated by Archbishop Athenagoras (later Patriarch) at Epiphany. St. Nicholas was by then a significant center of community life as well, with major festivals surrounding Epiphany, Greek Independence Day, and Orthodox Easter. Honoring this, in 1975, the Tarpon Springs Board of Commissioners passed a resolution designating the city the \\"Epiphany City\\" of the United States. St. Nicholas was elevated to cathedral status for West Florida on On January 6, 1976.

In many-body systems, several of the relevant states have an energy difference that matches with the energy of a THz photon. Therefore, THz spectroscopy provides a particularly powerful method in resolving and controlling individual transitions between different many-body states. By doing this, one gains new insights about many- body quantum kinetics and how that can be utilized in developing new technologies that are optimized up to the elementary quantum level. Different electronic excitations within semiconductors are already widely used in lasers, electronic components and computers. At the same time, they constitute an interesting many-body system whose quantum properties can be modified, e.g., via a nanostructure design. Consequently, THz spectroscopy on semiconductors is relevant in revealing both new technological potentials of nanostructures as well as in exploring the fundamental properties of many-body systems in a controlled fashion. Background There are a great variety of techniques to generate THz radiation and to detect THz fields. One can, e.g., use an antenna, a quantum-cascade laser, a free-electron laser, or optical rectification to produce well-defined THz sources. The resulting THz field can be characterized via its electric field ETHz(t). Present-day experiments can already output ETHz(t) that has a peak value in the range of MV/cm (megavolts per centimeter).Junginger, F.; Sell, A.; Schubert, O.; Mayer, B.; Brida, D.; Marangoni, M.; Cerullo, G.; Leitenstorfer, A. et al. (2010). \\"Single-cycle multiterahertz transients with peak fields above 10 MV/cm\\". Optics Letters 35 (15): 2645. doi:10.1364/OL.35.002645 To estimate how strong such fields are, one can compute the level of energy change such fields induce to an electron over microscopic distance of one nanometer (nm), i.e., L = 1 nm. One simply multiplies the peak ETHz(t) with elementary charge e and L to obtain e ETHz(t) L = 100 meV. In other words, such fields have a major effect on electronic systems because the mere field strength of ETHz(t) can induce electronic transitions over microscopic scales. One possibility is to use such THz fields to study Bloch oscillationsFeldmann, J.; Leo, K.; Shah, J.; Miller, D.; Cunningham, J.; Meier, T.; von Plessen, G.; Schulze, A.; Thomas, P.; Schmitt- Rink, S.

The THz sources can be also extremely short,Jepsen, P.U.; Cooke, D.G.; Koch, M. (2011). \\"Terahertz spectroscopy and imaging - Modern techniques and applications\\".

Consequently, one can use THz fields to monitor and control ultrafast processes in semiconductors or to produce ultrafast switching in semiconductor components. Obviously, the combination of ultrafast duration and strong peak ETHz(t) provides vast new possibilities to systematic studies in semiconductors. Besides the strength and duration of ETHz(t), the THz field's photon energy plays a vital role in semiconductor investigations because it can be made resonant with several intriguing many-body transitions. For example, electrons in conduction band and holes, i.e., electronic vacancies, in valence band attract each other via the Coulomb interaction. Under suitable conditions, electrons and holes can be bound to excitons that are hydrogen- like states of matter. At the same time, the exciton binding energy is few to hundreds of meV that can be matched energetically with a THz photon. Therefore, the presence of excitons can be uniquely detectedTimusk, T.; Navarro, H.; Lipari, N.O.; Altarelli, M. (1978). \\"Far-infrared absorption by excitons in silicon\\".

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy In optical spectroscopy, the detectors typically measure the intensity of the light field rather than the electric field because there are no detectors that can directly measure electromagnetic fields in the optical range. However, there are multiple techniques, such as antennas and electro-optical sampling, that can be applied to measure the time evolution of ETHz(t) directly. For example, one can propagate a THz pulse through a semiconductor sample and measure the transmitted and reflected fields as function of time. Therefore, one collects information of semiconductor excitation dynamics completely in time domain, which is the general principle of the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. Using Terahertz for developing transmission images of packaged items. By using short THz pulses, a great variety of physical phenomena have already been studied. For unexcited, intrinsic semiconductors one can determine the complex permittivity or THz-absorption coefficient and refractive index, respectively.Grischkowsky, D.; Keiding, Søren; Exter, Martin van; Fattinger, Ch. (1990). \\"Far-infrared time-domain spectroscopy with terahertz beams of dielectrics and semiconductors\\". Journal of the Optical Society of America B 7 (10): 2006. doi:10.1364/JOSAB.7.002006 The frequency of transversal-optical phonons, to which THz photons can couple, lies for most semiconductors at several THz.Han, P.

Applied Physics Letters 73 (21): 3049. doi:10.1063/1.122668 Free carriers in doped semiconductors or optically excited semiconductors lead to a considerable absorption of THz photons.Zhang, W.; Azad, Abul K.; Grischkowsky, D. (2003). \\"Terahertz studies of carrier dynamics and dielectric response of n-type, freestanding epitaxial GaN\\". Applied Physics Letters 82 (17): 2841. doi:10.1063/1.1569988 Since THz pulses passes through non-metallic materials, they can be used for inspection and transmission of packaged items. Terahertz-induced plasma and exciton transitions The THz fields can be applied to accelerate electrons out of their equilibrium. If this is done fast enough, one can measure the elementary processes, such as how fast the screening of the Coulomb interaction is built up. This was experimentally explored in Ref.Huber, R.; Tauser, F.; Brodschelm, A.; Bichler, M.; Abstreiter, G.; Leitenstorfer, A. (2001). Nature 414 (6861): 286–289. doi:10.1038/35104522 where it was shown that screening is complete within tens of femtoseconds in semiconductors. These insights are very important to understand how electronic plasma behaves in solids. The Coulomb interaction can also pair electrons and holes into excitons, as discussed above. Due to their analog to the hydrogen atom, excitons have bound states that can be uniquely identified by the usual quantum numbers 1s, 2s, 2p, and so on. In particular, 1s-to-2p transition is dipole allowed and can be directly generated by ETHz(t) if the photon energy matches the transition energy. In gallium arsenide-type systems, this transition energy is roughly 4 meV that corresponds to 1 THz photons. At resonance, the dipole d1s,2p defines the Rabi energy ΩRabi = d1s,2p ETHz(t) that determines the time scale at which the 1s-to-2p transition proceeds. For example, one can excite the excitonic transition with an additional optical pulse which is synchronized with the THz pulse. This technique is called transient THz spectroscopy. Using this technique one can follow the formation dynamics of excitons or observe THz gain arising from intraexcitonic transitions.Kira, M.; Koch, S. (2004). \\"Exciton-Population Inversion and Terahertz Gain in Semiconductors Excited to Resonance\\".

Physical Review Letters 96 (1). doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.017402 Since a THz pulse can be intense and short, e.g., single-cycle, it is experimentally possible to realize situations where duration of the pulse, time scale related to Rabi- as well as the THz photon energy ħω are degenerate. In this situation, one enters the realm of extreme nonlinear opticsWegener, M. (2005). M. Extreme Nonlinear Optics: An Introduction. Springer. where the usual approximations, such as the rotating- wave approximation (abbreviated as RWA) or the conditions for complete state transfer, break down. As a result, the Rabi oscillations become strongly distorted by the non-RWA contributions, the multiphoton absorption or emission processes, and the dynamic Franz–Keldysh effect, as measured in Refs.Danielson, J.; Lee, Yun-Shik; Prineas, J.; Steiner, J.; Kira, M.; Koch, S.

Physical Review Letters 110 (13). doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.137404 Theory of terahertz transitions Terahertz transitions in solids can be systematically approached by generalizing the semiconductor Bloch equations and the related many-body correlation dynamics. At this level, one realizes the THz field are directly absorbed by two-particle correlations that modify the quantum kinetics of electron and hole distributions. Therefore, a systematic THz analysis must include the quantum kinetics of many-body correlations, that can be treated systematically, e.g., with the cluster-expansion approach. At this level, one can explain and predict a wide range of effects with the same theory, ranging from Drude-like response of plasma to extreme nonlinear effects of excitons.

He used to be the Pakistan bureau chief for The New York Times. He has worked for The Guardian. Walsh was expelled from Pakistan in May 2013 but continued covering the country from London. Educated in Dublin, BComm International, University College Dublin and MA in Journalism from Dublin City University, Walsh started his career at The Sunday Business Post in 1998. A year later he won an Irish national media award for Social and Campaigning Journalism and moved to Kenya to work as a freelance journalist. Based in Nairobi, Walsh travelled widely across sub-Saharan Africa to report for The Independent of London and The Irish Times. In 2004 he joined The Guardian as the paper's correspondent for Afghanistan and Pakistan and moved to Islamabad, Pakistan. In January 2012 he moved to The New York Times as its Pakistan bureau chief. On May 9, 2013, Walsh learned by letter that the Pakistan Ministry of Interior, citing \\"undesirable activities\\", cancelled his visas that had been valid until January 2014 and he had 72 hours to leave the country. On May 11, 2013, while he was in public reporting on Pakistan's general election and voting behaviour in Lahore, state security officials detained him in a hotel and escorted him to the airport the following morning. The New York Times and other international media organisations protested his expulsion, which was seen as counter to Pakistan's current policy on democracy and freedom of the press. Pakistani news media later reported that Walsh had been placed on Pakistan's official \\"blacklist\\" and had been declared \\"persona non grata\\". In March 2014 Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif assured a visiting delegation from the Committee to Protect Journalists that an \\"immediate review\\" of incident would be conducted. The Sharif statement was an encouragement to the editor of the New York Times, Jill Abramson. Walsh's case was outlined in detail in \\"A Bullet has been chosen for you: Attacks on journalists in Pakistan\\", a report by Amnesty International on declining media freedom in Pakistan, which was published in April 2014. Over the past decade Walsh has written extensively on Pakistani culture, society, politics and militancy. Shortly after his expulsion he wrote a detailed account of the crumbling state of Pakistan Railways. He has contributed to Granta magazine and been shortlisted for several journalism prizes including the British Press Awards and the Orwell Prize. On May 17, 2015 Walsh published a New York Times story about large-scale international diploma mill scams perpetrated by the Pakistani company Axact. Following the publication of the New York Times article, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan directed the country's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to begin inquiry into whether the company was involved in any illegal business. Following the interior minister's order, cyber crime team of FIA raided Axact's office in Karachi and Islamabad and seized co17mputers, recorded statements of employees as well taking into custody several company employees. The FIA team found and seized several blank degrees as well as fake letterhead of the US State Department. The issue was also taken up in Senate of Pakistan where Chairman of the Senate Ra17,za Rabbani constituted a committee to probe into the issue. Pakistan's tax authorities and the SECP also initiated investigations into the company. In 2017, Walsh barely escaped being arrested in Egypt. NYT publisher Arthur Sulzberger announced this event in a September 23, 2019 presentation at Brown University, which was also published as an OpEd in the paper: \\"Two years ago, we got a call from a United States government official warning us of the imminent arrest of a New York Times reporter based in Egypt named Declan Walsh. Though the news was alarming, the call was actually fairly standard. Over the years, we’ve received countless such warnings from American diplomats, military leaders and national security officials. \\"But this particular call took a surprising and distressing turn. We learned the official was passing along this warning without the knowledge or permission of the Trump administration. Rather than trying to stop the Egyptian government or assist the reporter, the official believed, the Trump administration intended to sit on the information and let the arrest be carried out. The official feared being punished for even alerting us to the danger. \\"Unable to count on our own government to prevent the arrest or help free Declan if he were imprisoned, we turned to his native country, Ireland, for help. Within an hour, Irish diplomats traveled to his house and safely escorted him to the airport before Egyptian forces could detain him. \\"We hate to imagine what would have happened had that brave official not risked their career to alert us to the threat.\\"A.

Andy Warhol In her 2014 biography, Valerie Solanas, Breanne Fahs states that Solanas was at the Actor's Studio that morning looking for Lee Strasberg, asking to leave her play for him. Sylvia Miles states that she told Solanas that Strasberg would not be in until the afternoon, and accepted a copy of the play from Solanas. Fahs records that Solanas then traveled to Feiden's residence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, as Solanas believed that Feiden would be willing to produce her play. As related to Fahs, Solanas talked to Feiden for almost four hours, trying to convince her to produce the play and discussing her vision for a world without men. Throughout this time, Feiden repeatedly refused to produce Solanas's play. According to Feiden, Solanas then pulled out her gun, and when Feiden again refused to commit to producing the play, Solanas responded, \\"Yes, you will produce the play because I'll shoot Andy Warhol and that will make me famous and the play famous, and then you'll produce it.\\" As she was leaving Feiden's residence, Solanas handed Feiden a copy of her play and other personal papers. Fahs describes how Feiden then \\"frantically called her local police precinct, Andy Warhol's precinct, police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, and the offices of Mayor John Lindsay and Governor Nelson Rockefeller to report what happened and inform them that Solanas was on her way at that very moment to shoot Andy Warhol.\\" In some instances, the police responded that \\"You can't arrest someone because you believe she is going to kill Andy Warhol,\\" and even asked Feiden \\"Listen lady, how would you know what a real gun looked like?\\" In a 2009 interview with James Barron of The New York Times, Feiden said that she did know that Solanas intended to kill Warhol, but could not prevent it.Barron, James (June 23, 2009).

Inspired by the \\"linguistic turn\\" in the field of humanities, it was developed as an alternative to the epistemological limitations of \\"neo-positivist\\" policy analysis and its underlying technocratic understanding of the decision-making process. The argumentative approach systematically integrates empirical and normative questions into a methodological framework oriented towards the analysis of policy deliberation. It is sensitive to the situative context and the multiple kinds of knowledge practices involved in each stage of the policy process, drawing attention to different forms of argumentation, persuasion and justification.  Overview  The term \\"argumentative turn\\" was introduced by Frank Fischer and John F. Forester in the introduction to their edited volume \\"The argumentative turn in policy analysis and planning\\", published in 1993, assembling a group of different approaches towards policy analysis that share an emphasis on the importance of language, meaning, rhetoric and values as key features in the analysis of policy-making and planning.Fischer and Forester 1993 As a shift away from the positivistic and technocratic implications of the dominant empirical approach to problem-solving, the argumentative turn tries to offer an alternative perspective towards policy inquiry. Instead of focusing exclusively on empiricist law-like logical inference and causal explanation, the post-empiricist approach highlights numerous forms of social research practices, thereby not disqualifying the search for empirically valid data, but embedding scientific expertise into a meaningful social context. The argumentative approach therefore rejects the assumption that policy analysis can be a value-free, technical project, since it always involves complex combinations of descriptive and normative elements.Fischer and Gottweis 2012 As a commitment to deliberative and participatory conceptions of democracy, the argumentative perspective also rejects a top-down understanding of governance, testifying to the dynamic exchange between public and private interests and the important role of experts in the complex processes of policy-making. The policy-analyst is no longer concerned with the improvement of political performance, but tries to stimulate the political process of policy deliberation, thereby promoting communicative competences and social learning.Fischer 2007, p. 225Fischer 2003b, p. 224  Emergence of the argumentative approach  The argumentative approach towards policy analysis grew out of a disappointment with the prevailing intellectual setting, since the 60s largely dominated by the \\"rational project\\" of neo-positivist political science, and its tendency to mask political and bureaucratic interests behind an ideology of science as a value free project.Fischer 2003a, p. 14 In 1989, Giandomenico Majone published 'Evidence, Argument, and Persuasion in Policy Analysis' that together with Deborah Stone's \\"Policy Paradox\\" (1988) and John S. Dryzek's \\"Discursive Democracy\\" (1990) became key texts in the formative process of the new argumentative perspective on policy analysis. But it was not until Frank Fischer and John F. Forester proclaimed \\"The Argumentative Turn in Policy Analysis and Planning\\" (1993) that argumentative policy analysis became a distinctive approach with a well defined research agenda, which moved language, argumentation and rhetoric to the center of attention.Gottweis 2006, p. 463 Although other approaches to policy analysis also highlighted the important role of ideas,Hall 1993 they tended to conceptualize language only as one variable next to others, thereby neglecting its constitutive role in the construction of social reality. The argumentative approach on the other hand puts a more sophisticated emphasis and a deeper understanding to important aspects of language and discourse in the policy process. Ideas and discourse are not only means for actors trying to achieve particular ends, but they have a force of their own, especially in combination with relations of power, since they both carry knowledge and frame social reality.Fischer 2003a  Theoretical tradition  Building on Harold Lasswell, founder of the \\"policy science orientation\\", the argumentative perspective combines a multidisciplinary approach to policy analysis with an explicitly normative orientation towards democratic values.Fischer 2007 Therefore, it integrates multiple theoretical perspectives that altogether highlight the importance of language and meaning in the context of social inquiry: British ordinary language analysis, French post-structuralism, Frankfurt school of critical social theory and American pragmatism. On the one hand, the importance of the work of Jürgen Habermas on communicative action and his critique of technocracy and scientism, together with Michel Foucault's writings on discourse and power cannot be overestimated in their contribution of major theoretical elements to the development of the argumentative approach. The contextual orientation towards the situated nature of argumentative praxis, on the other hand, was heavily influenced 1) by the tradition of \\"ordinary language philosophy\\", especially the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and John L. Austin's speech act theory, and 2) by scholars of pragmatism, like George Herbert Mead, John Dewey, Charles S. Peirce and Richard Rorty.Gottweis 2007 Nonetheless, due to the multiple and dispersed perspectives on language and meaning the argumentative approach tries to articulate, there exist great variations concerning the basic theoretical assumptions (hermeneutics, structuralism/post-structuralism, pragmatism).  Knowledge and deliberative practice  Instead of offering a comprehensive theory of knowledge, the argumentative approach tries to focus on a better description of what social scientist already do.Fischer 2003b, p. 209 Science is understood as a socio-cultural practice mediated by symbolic systems of meaning, located in historically specific places and communities. Therefore, the argumentative approach rejects neo-positivistic versions of correspondence theory, rather building scientific investigation on a coherence theory of truth,Fischer 2003b, p. 217 thereby giving voice to the importance of inter- subjective practices of argumentation and deliberation. Every empirical proposition is haunted by factors of indeterminacy, while empirical data only makes sense located in a meaningful context. The argumentative approach therefore tries to develop a richer perspective on political controversies, which cannot be understood to be about raw data, but rather about the conflicting assumptions that organize them.Fischer 2003b, p. 218 Logical deduction and empirical falsification cannot make sense of a world that is much more complex and in flux, than necessary for the maintenance of the neo- positivist perspective. Therefore, the post-empiricist framework involves a multimethodological approach, that substitutes the formal logic of neo- positivism, with something that Aristotle called phronesis - an informal deliberative framework of practical reason.Fischer 2007, p. 229Fischer 2003b, p. 220 This conception of reason proofs to be a more accurate response to the forms of rationality exhibited in real-world policy analysis and implementation.  Assembling different approaches  The argumentative turn links different approaches in the field of policy science that altogether put a strong emphasis on the important role of language and meaning: * Argumentative policy analysis (Fischer 2003a, Gottweis 2006) * Participatory policy analysis (Fischer 1990, 2007) * Interpretative policy analysis (Yanow 1996, 2006) * Policy frame analysis (Schön and Rein 1994, Yanow 2006, Waagenar 2011) * Critical policy discourse analysis (Gottweis 1998, Hajer 1995, Wagenaar 2011, Yanow 2006) * Post-structuralist Policy Analysis (Gottweis 1998) * Narrative policy analysis (Roe 1994) * Rhetorical policy analysis (Gottweis 2006) * Communicative policy analysis (Fischer 2007) * Dramaturgical policy analysis (Hajer and Veersteg 2005) * Deliberative policy analysis (Hajer and Wagenaar 2003) * Discourse coalition theory (Hajer 2005)  Critique and reaction  The main critique often pointed against discursive approaches and their focus on narratives, language and deliberation, is that they imply 1) a version of idealism and 2) forms of scientific, moral and political relativism.Marsh and Furlong 2002Fischer 2003bHajer and Wagenaar 2003Wagenaar 2005 Against the first point, the argumentative approach does not deny the existence of a world out there, but rather points to the cognitive limits of scientific inquiry. Whatever the inner nature of the world out there might be, we have no immediate access to it. Our perspective on the world is always mediated by socio-cultural systems of meaning and the cognitive frames that are expressions of our situated knowledge. Discourse operate as conditions of possibility of experience, since they provide reality with meaning and draw a line between the visible and the invisible.Gottweis 1998 The second point is directed against the contextualism of the argumentative approach, saying that there is no point from which to distinguish the true from the false or the good from the bad, so every perspective is equal to another. But this view from nowhere, where everything has the status of being valid in same way, does not exist for the post-positivist researcher. The perspective of the policy-analyst is always already organized according to a shared horizon of meaning, where she can put herself into the positions of reflective distance, but cannot transcend it. Political actors, social scientists and people doing their everyday business always use specific systems of evaluation and judgment, which are actualized or transformed in the context of their inter-subjective deliberative practices. On the one hand, building on Foucault, discourse has to be connected to the analysis of relations of power, although communicative practises cannot be reduced to mere manifestations of dominance or ideology. On the other hand, sticking to Habermas, the approach makes an explicit normative commitment towards conceptions of deliberative democracy, thereby facilitating dialogical exchange and debate between actors with different interests and perspectives.
