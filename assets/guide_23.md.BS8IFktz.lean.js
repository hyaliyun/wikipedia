It is the second of Bach's keyboard concerto composed in 1738, scored for keyboard and baroque string orchestra. The movements were reworkings of parts of two of Bach's church cantatas composed in 1726: the solo obbligato organ played the sinfonias for the two fast movements; and the remaining alto aria provided the slow movement.  Historical context  Like the other harpsichord concertos, BWV 1053 is generally agreed to be a transcription of a lost instrumental concerto. As with the harpsichord concerto BWV 1052, all the movements had previous incarnations in Leipzig cantatas written ten or more years prior to the 1738 or 1739 autograph manuscript, with the part of the melody instrument written for obbligato organ. The first and second movements of BWV 1053 corresponds to the opening Sinfonia (in D major) and alto aria \\"Stirb in mir, Welt\\" (in B minor) in Gott soll allein mein Herze haben, BWV 169; and the finale to the opening Sinfonia (in E major) in Ich geh und suche mit Verlangen, BWV 49. The cantatas, part of a series where Bach developed the obbligato organ as a chamber or orchestral instrument, were first performed in October and November 1726 in the Thomaskirche, within two weeks of each other. The scoring in BWV 169 includes two oboes and a taille as ripieno instruments in the sinfonia and an oboe d'amore in the aria. In the aria, the lines of the alto soloist and organ weave around each in what Alfred D√ºrr has described as \\"undoubtedly one of the most inspired vocal pieces that Bach ever wrote ... a passionate submersion in heavenly love.\\" 600px As comments, this shows the subtleties in Bach's process of arrangement. In this case the superposition of the additional vocal line over the keyboard part \\"aims at the exploration, enrichment and perfection of the original compositional material.\\" An oboe d'amore was also added as a ripieno instrument in the sinfonia of BWV 49.See:  Since Ulrich Siegele's 1957 dissertation, where he suggested that BWV 1053 originated in either a flute concerto in F major or oboe concerto in E major, a number of reconstructions for different melody instruments have been proposed, all discussed in : Hermann T√∂ttcher & Gottfried M√ºller (in F major for oboe, 1955); by Wilfried Fischer (in E major for oboe, 1966, and viola, 1996); by Joshua Rifkin (in E major for oboe, 1983); by Arnold Mehl (in D major for oboe d'amore. 1983): and by Bruce Haynes (in D major for oboe d'amore, 1998). Further discussions concerning the possible original form of the concerto can be found in , , and . In , problems with all the reconstructions are mentioned: for woodwind instruments, breathing problems created by long uninterrupted passages of semiquaver triplets in the third movement; and for the viola, the complete absence of string-like figurations in the whole concerto. Given the occurrence of all three movements in 1726 cantatas, he has suggested that the concerto might originally have been composed for an unspecified keyboard instrument‚Äîinterchangeably a harpsichord or an organ depending on the venue‚Äîand that it might have been one of the pieces played during Bach's recital on the Silbermann organ in the Sophienkirche, Dresden in September 1725.See:   * The harpsichord part in the first movement of BWV 1053 differs from the 1726 organ part in several ways in the solo passages: in the right hand the melody line became far more elaborate and ornamental; and in the left hand the figured bass line was replaced by a denser texture of fully worked out figures and chords‚Äîthe left hand was \\"emancipated\\" in the words of . At the same time in the orchestral parts, Bach reduced the contributions of the lower strings and adjusted the contributions from upper strings to create a proper balance with the harpsichord, with none of the string parts doubled except for the bass instruments. The lighter scoring permitted counterpoint between the first violin and the harpsichord in solo episodes. This method of adaptation‚Äîin the style of Bach's full maturity‚Äîwas a departure from that used for BWV 1052 and was employed in the subsequent concertos BWV 1054‚Äì1057.See  *( * *  Musical structure  = First movement: [Allegro] = 500px The musical structure of the first movement of BWV 1053‚Äîconcisely written but complex in its many intricate and ingenious details‚Äîhas been analysed in and . The movement combines the strict da capo A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form of an aria with the ritornello structure of a concerto. Section A comprises 62 bars. In the opening eight-bar ritornello, the harpsichord initially plays as part of the ripieno, taking the first violin part in the right hand and the continuo in the left. After this tutti opening the harpsichord follows its own course, responding with a nine- bar episode that introduces its own material. 800px There are three further ritornello passages with two intermittent responses in solo episodes for the harpsichord. Bach devised the harpsichord's rhythmic thematic material as a contrasting counter-theme to the semiquaver motifs at the head of the ritornello. In each reprise the scoring of the ritornello is varied: the harpsichord alternates between its own counter-theme and that of the opening ritornello; it plays increasingly brilliant variants of its own material‚Äîeventually including joyful dactyl motifs‚Äîin counterpoint to the semiquaver violin theme. The middle section B is 51 bars long and is mostly in the minor mode, beginning in F minor. There are three solo episodes for harpsichord punctuated by two reprises of the orchestral ritornello, first in F (bar 69) and then in its relative major key, A major (bar 81). Less tied to the ritornello, the harpsichord freely develops its own material, which is derived from that of section A. The third and longest episode of 27 bars begins in bar 86 and remains centred on the tonality of C minor. The strings provide a simple accompaniment to the long phrases of the extended harpsichord solo; between phrases the first violin plays a brief reprise in C minor of the opening semiquaver motif of the ritornello. The episode culminates in a semiquaver passage over an extended G pedal point and an Adagio cadence and fermata in C minor. The movement then resumes with a recapitulation of the whole of section A.See  * = Second movement: Siciliano = 500px The slow movement in C‚ôØ minor and time is a Siciliano, which has described as beautiful and haunting. In da capo form, the sustained string ritornello is accompanied by the harpsichord with an explicit realisation of the figured bass by gentle broken chord semiquavers. After the opening ritornello, the harpsichord, accompanied by detached quaver chords in the strings, plays its own melodic line spun out in two long increasingly ornamented phrases, the second of which merges into the semiquaver accompaniment of the closing ritornello.See:  * 800px = Third movement: Allegro = The third movement of BWV 1053 is a sprightly and dance-like allegro in E major and time. Like the first movement, its concise and ingenious compositional form combines the da capo structure of an aria with the ritornello structure of a concerto; it also has similarly light scoring in the orchestral parts to create a proper balance between harpsichord and strings. Although the overall structure is similar to that of the first movement, the alternations between concertato soloist and ripieno are more frequent and complex. Rather than the concertos of Vivaldi, Gregory Butler has suggested that this movement is closer in form and style to the concertos of another of Bach's Italian contemporaries, the Venetian composer Tomaso Albinoni. Butler has made a detailed study of Albinoni's two sets of twelve concerti a cinque, Op.7 (1715) and Op.9 (1722), each set having four violin concertos, four oboe concertos and four double oboe concertos, and has proposed the last movement of the double oboe concerto op.9, No.3 as a possible precursor of BWV 1053/3. Bach's third movement is written in strict da capo A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form, with 137 bars in the A section and 122 in the B section. The opening eighteen-bar ritornello has an introductory section or Vordersatz of four bars: the strings play the \\"head\\" motif‚Äîthree quavers, four semiquavers and a quaver‚Äîin canon commencing in the first violin, then the second and then the viola. This rhythm is repeated in the first eight bars of the ritornello. Below the strings and the only instrument starting the movement, the harpsichord plays an introductory flourish of arpeggiated semiquaver triplets filling in the harmonies and spanning almost the entire keyboard. In the remainder of the ritornello the harpsichord doubles the first violin part in the right hand and the continuo in the left. 500px The harpsichord then begins its own thematic material in the first solo episode. At first it plays only the first four bars as a brief declamation, which elicits the ritornello's Vordersatz as a response. This is followed by a reprise by the harpsichord of the new thematic material, now extended to a sixteen bar episode. 700px This episode is followed by a reprise of the entire 18-bar ritornello in the dominant key of B major. In this reprise the lower string parts are pruned; now the right hand of the harpsichord part provides the counterpoint to the first violin part that instead of the second violin and viola; and the left hand plays its own semiquaver figuration in tandem with the continuo line. There are two further episodes for the harpsichord in which its own material is developed with passagework in semiquavers, in semiquaver triplets and in parallel and contrary motion semiquavers in both hands. These are separated by a shortened version of the ritornello and followed by a full version, with its last two bars pruned down to harpsichord and first violin. Section A concludes, following the traditional pattern established by Albinoni, with a repetition of the main body (Vorspinnung) and concluding part (Epilog) of the ritornello, with the harpsichord once more doubling the first violin and continuo parts. In section B, which immediately follows, Bach breaks with tradition: now in the relative minor, G minor, he introduces in the first solo harpsichord episode a highly contrasting chromatic theme accompanied by characteristic semiquaver figures in the left hand. 450px Of 38 bars in length and punctuated by fragmentary responses from the strings, the solo episode modulates through the keys of B major and C minor to a cadence in F‚ôØ minor. It is followed by a sequence of short passages alternating between ritornello material and solo material for the harpsichord drawn from both section B (semiquaver figures) and then section A (the beginning of the harpsichord theme). The ritornello segments move from F minor to E major, the final segment modulating from F minor to B major and then E major. The next twelve bar solo episode continues with and develops the harpsichord's thematic material from section A, modulating from E major, to B major and then to the distant key of D major. The 4-bar Vordersatz from the ritornello is then played in this key, then in G major, reaching the key of C minor. Section B ends symmetrically with an extended 33-bar solo episode, a variant of the long chromatic episode with which it began, After modulating through the keys of G minor, C minor and D minor, the movement briefly halts in the manner of a Scarlatti da capo aria with a cadence to the mediant key of G minor. The music resumes with a capitulation of section A.See:  * * Selected recordings =With harpsichord= * Gustav Leonardt, Leonhardt-Consort; 1968; TelDec * Igor Kipnis, The London Strings, Neville Marriner; 1971; CBS Masterworks Records M2YK 45616 * Trevor Pinnock, The English Concert; 1981; Archiv Produktion 471754-2 (2002 re-issue) * Christine Schornsheim, Neues Bachisches Collegium Musicum, Burkhard Glaetzner; 1990-1992; Brilliant Classics * Andreas Staier, Freiburger Barockorchester; 2013; Harmonia Mundi HMC 902181.82 * Christophe Rousset, The Academy of Ancient Music, Christopher Hogwood; 1999; L'Oiseau Lyre * B√©atrice Martin, Les Folies Fran√ßoises, Patrick Cohen-Akenine; 2011; Cypres =With piano= * Andrei Gavrilov, Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, Neville Marriner; 1987; EMI Classics 573641-2 (1999 re-issue) * Murray Perahia, Academy of St. Martin in the Fields; 2000-2001; Sony Classical SK89245 / SK89690 * Angela Hewitt, Australian Chamber Orchestra, Richard Tognetti; 2005; Hyperion =With organ= * Andr√© Isoir, Le Parlement de Musique, Martin Gester; 1993; Calliope CAL 9720 * Peter Hurford, Royal Northern Sinfonia, Richard Hickox; 1990; Argo =With oboe= * Marcel Ponseele, Il Gardellino; 2005; Accent References Sources * *, preface (note there is a later edition with piano reductions by Werner Breig)     * External links * Category:Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Harpsichord concertos Category:Compositions in E major ","title":"Harpsichord Concerto in E major, BWV 1053"},{"id":"56992815","text":"Network Norwich is the brand name given to First Norfolk & Suffolk bus services in and around the city of Norwich.

Vehicle 60916, one of two Eastern Counties retro-liveried vehicles in the fleet, crossing the bridge in Wroxham, March 2018. As of March 2018, Network Norwich had two vehicles painted in retro liveries based on those of the former Eastern Counties bus company, from which Network Norwich (and, by extension, First Norfolk & Suffolk) can trace their history. Both vehicles were Volvo B7L single-deckers with Wright Eclipse Metro bodywork, built in 2002 and originally delivered new to First York and most recently in service with First South Yorkshire before being transferred to Norwich to be repainted into their retro liveries, these have since been scrapped. Recently, a third vehicle has been repainted in a heritage livery. A Volvo B7RLE with Wright Eclipse Urban bodywork, numbered 66985, received the same livery as 60916. In September 2020, another vehicle was transferred to Norwich in a heritage livery from its time in Sheffield,it wears the colours for the Mainline operator.

The large initial marks the start of Dietrichs Flucht. Dietrichs Flucht (Dietrich's Flight) or Das Buch von Bern (The Book of Verona) is an anonymous 13th-century Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. It is part of the so-called \\"historical\\" Dietrich material and is closely related to, and always transmitted together with, a second Dietrich poem, the Rabenschlacht. A Heinrich der Vogler is named as author in an excursus of the poem. Earlier scholarship considered him to be the author of Dietrichs Flucht and possibly also of the Rabenschlacht, however more recent scholarship believes he is only author of this excursus. Dietrichs Flucht describes the rule of Dietrich's ancestors in his kingdom in northern Italy; his betrayal and exile by his wicked uncle Ermenrich, and his flight to the Huns, where he is warmly received by Etzel and his wife Helche. With Etzel's help, Dietrich makes two attempts to reclaim his kingdom from Ermenrich, but each time his victory is pyrrhic and he is forced to return to exile with the Huns. Unlike most German heroic poems, the poem is written in rhyming couplets, suggesting that it may have been intended to be read as a historical document like a rhymed chronicle. Alternatively, the choice of couplets may suggest a nearness to the genre of chivalric romance. The poem unites figures from various German heroic traditions, including the Nibelungenlied, Wolfdietrich, and Ortnit. Summary Dietrichs Flucht begins with a long history of Dietrich's ancestors, who all live exceptionally long, Methuselan and virtuous lives and leave a single heir to the kingdom. They are native to Italy (called Lomparten or R≈ìmischlant) and spend their lives acquiring brides and fighting dragons. This easy line of inheritance is broken first by Ortnit, who is killed by a dragon, but the succession is restored by Wolfdietrich, who marries Ortnit's widow and becomes king. Wolfdietrich has 56 children, but all die except for Hugdietrich. Hugdietrich's son Amelung, has three sons: Ermenrich, Dietmar, and Diether. When Hugdietrich dies, he divides the country among his children, Dietmar receiving Bern (Verona). Emenrich is the father of Friderich, Dietmar of Dietrich and Diether (II), and Diether of the two Harlungen. Dietmar places his children into Ermenrich's care when he dies, however, Ermenrich proves treacherous. First he murderers the two Harlungen and takes over their country, failing to capture their regent Eckehart, then invites Dietrich to visit him in order to murder him as well. Ermenrich's messenger warns Dietrich, however, and so Ermenrich is forced to invade with an army. Dietrich defeats Ermenrich decisively in battle at Milan, capturing Ermenrich's son Friderich. He is left without any money to reward his soldiers, so he sends a group of vassals to fetch some. This group falls into an ambush by Witege, a former vassal of Dietrich's who switched sides. This results in the capture of Dietrich's best warriors, among them Hildebrand and Wolfhart. Ermenrich refuses Dietrich's offer to exchange Friderich for the prisoners and says he will only release Dietrich's men if the latter leaves the country, which, against the advice of his remaining warriors, Dietrich chooses to do. All the inhabitants of Bern leave the city, including women and children. Dietrich goes into exile with 50 warriors, making his way to the court of Etzel, King of the Huns, at Gran. There with the help of R√ºdiger and Etzel's wife Helche, Dietrich receives Etzel's support to return to Italy. Dietrich's vassal Amelolt comes to Etzel's court at this time and announces he was able to recapture Bern. Dietrich sets out immediately with the Hunnish army and his remaining warriors, followed by a large army commanded by R√ºdiger. They defeat Ermenrich once again in battle at Milan, and Ermenrich fleas to Ravenna, where Dietrich besieges him. Ermenrich is able to slip out of the city to Bologna, however. Ermenrich ransoms his captured men, except for Witige, whom Dietrich refuses to release due to his treachery. On the advice of his vassals and R√ºdiger, however, Dietrich forgives Witige, makes him governor of Ravenna, and gives him the horse Schemming as a gift. Dietrich then heads back to Etzel's residence at Etzelburg. Etzel and Helche suggest that Dietrich marry Helche's niece and lady-in-waiting Herrat, which Dietrich initially refuses. Hildebrand and R√ºdiger eventually convince him to accept the offer. Now Eckehart arrives and tells Dietrich that Witege has betrayed him, handing Ravenna over to Ermenrich who has killed all the inhabitants. Dietrich despairs, but Etzel is enraged and puts together a large army, which marches and defeats Ermenrich outside Bologna. Ermenrich flees into the city, but Dietrich's victory is Pyrrhic, as he has lost many good warriors. Dietrich is particularly saddened by the death of Wolfhart's brother Alphart. He is forced to return to Etzel. Dating, creation, and transmission Dietrichs Flucht is transmitted together with tee Rabenschlacht in four complete manuscripts and alone in one fragmentary manuscript: *Riedegger Manuscript (R), Staatsbibliothek Berlin, Ms. germ 2o 1062, on parchment from the end of the thirteenth century, from Nieder√∂sterreich. Contains various literary texts. *Windhager Manuscript (W), √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek Vienna, Cod. 2779, parchment, first quarter of the fourteenth century, from Nieder√∂sterreich. Contains various literary texts and the Kaiserchronik. * (P) Universit√§tsbibliothek Heidelberg, Cpg 314, paper, 1443/47, from Augsburg. Contains various literary texts. * Ambraser Heldenbuch (A), √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek Vienna, Cod. Series Nova 2663, parchment, 1504/1515, from Tyrol. Various literary texts. * (K) Universit√§tsbibliothek Innsbruck, B III, parchment, in Austro-Bavarian dialect, beginning of fourteenth century. Contains a fragment of Dietrichs Flucht. Excerpts from Dietrichs Flucht are also transmitted in some manuscripts of the World Chronicle of Heinrich von M√ºnchen. The origins of the earliest manuscripts as well as the dialect of the poem indicate that it was composed in Austria, sometime before 1300. Given several allusions to the ways that the dukes of Austria are reducing the rights of their vassals, the poem is typically dated to after the beginning of the rule of the Habsburgs in Austria in 1282. Alternatively, this may simply provide a date for when the poem was reworked by the author of these portions, Heinrich der Vogler (see below). Genre and interpretation Dietrichs Flucht is about 10000 lines long. The poem is unusual in that it is written in rhyming couplets rather than in stanzas, as is the case with most German heroic epics. It may indicate that the author was trying to make his work more similar to either courtly romance, or, more probably to a rhyming chronicle. With a single exception near the beginning, the narrator is absolutely insistent about the veracity of his story, repeating over and over again that what he is telling is true. His claims of both written and oral sources might serve to convince his audience that he is narrating historical truth while still providing the poem with the authority of the oral tradition. The poem also features a realistic geography of Northern Italy, with Norbert Voorwinden noting that the poem contains more Italian place names than any other medieval German source. He concludes that all of this indicates the work intends to imitate a chronicle. These claims appear to have been taken seriously, as the World Chronicle of Heinrich von M√ºnchen describes the life of the historical Theoderic according to Dietrichs Flucht. At the same time, the poem seeks to create something like a complete tale of the heroic world, including figures from Wolfdietrich, Ortnit, and the Nibelungenlied in Dietrich's genealogy. Moreover, Siegfried, Gunther, and Gernot all appear as figures in the poem. The opening lines of the poem also take their inspiration from the Nibelungenlied, but the opening of Dietrichs Flucht instead proclaims that it will tell newe maeren (new tales) rather than the alte maeren of the Nibelungenlied. Dietrich's repeated failed attempts to reclaim his homeland and his proclamations that he is armer Dieterich (poor Dietrich) may also derive from Dietrich's monologue in the Nibelungenlied upon losing his men. At the same time, the poem excludes any references to any tales found in the fantastical Dietrich poems. Heinzle suggests that these poems may not have seemed historical to the author. Several of Dietrich's ancestors nevertheless fight against dragons‚Äîthe only time this occurs in the historical Dietrich poems. Stylistically, the poem is notable for its portrayal of escalating violence: each battle that Dietrich fights is bloodier and deadlier than the last. The battle scenes are described in drastic terms, as the heroes literally wade in blood. Despite its drastic portrayal of warfare, the poem does not seem to criticize violence or warfare; while leaving little room for the heroic warrior ethos in the traditional sense, it nonetheless portrays battle as a tool that a ruler must use. Thematically, the poem largely deals with the topic of loyalty, especially between vassal and lord, with Dietrich and Etzel representing fealty, while Ermenrich, his deceitful advisor Sibeche, and the treacherous Witige represent disloyalty. Ermenrich appears to bring a sort of fall from grace and is described as the first figure to bring evil into the world. Dietrich is nevertheless unable to defeat him, showing that evil cannot be removed from the world. The long list of Dietrich's ancestors serves to legitimate his rule in Italy. Lienert notes that, although the poem clearly supports Dietrich over Ermenrich, it nevertheless questions some of his decisions. For instance, Dietrich decides to go into exile to save the men Ermenrich had captured against the advice of his vassals. His pardon of Witege, while advised by his vassals, far exceeds their advice by appointing Witege governor of Ravenna in his absence. Authorship and relationship to the Rabenschlacht A certain Heinrich der Vogler names himself as author in an excursus against princely caprice in the middle of Dietrichs Flucht. He is not attested elsewhere and may have been a wandering poet or minstrel. His authorship is now generally discounted, as it he is not named at the beginning or end of the text. Victor Millet notes, furthermore, that the excursus has some stylistic characteristics otherwise absent in the romance. Heinzle suggests that it is still possible that Heinrich is the author of Dietrichs Flucht, but finds it more likely that he merely wrote the excursus where he is named. Werner Hoffmann believes that Heinrich reworked and expanded a pre-existing poem and connected it with the Rabenschlacht. Hoffmann is highly critical of what he believes is Heinrich's work, pointing to numerous inconsistencies within Dietrichs Flucht (e.g. the hero Alphart dies twice) and between Dietrichs Flucht and Rabenschlacht. Sebastian Coxon argues that Heinrich's naming himself is a strategy to grant authorial authority to the excursus, in the same way as the poem's frequent recourse to oral and fictionalized written sources for its narrative. The excursus appears to describe the situation in Austria at the time of the poem's composition. Early scholarship believed that both Dietrichs Fluch and the Rabenschlacht had a single author; however, the formal and stylistic differences between the two epics have caused this theory to be abandoned. The manuscript transmission nevertheless makes clear that the Rabenschlacht and Dietrichs Flucht were viewed as a single work by contemporaries. Most scholarship holds the Rabenschlacht to be the older of the two poems, providing a model for the third battle and end of Dietrichs Flucht, though Millet questions this interpretation. It is clear, at any rate, that both works were deliberate brought together and adapted to be transmitted together, possibly by Heinrich der Vogler. Relation to the oral tradition Unlike for the supposedly older Rabenschlacht, the connection between Dietrichs Flucht and the oral tradition is disputed. Some debate exists over whether the oral tradition merely contained Dietrich's exile prior to the events of the Rabenschlacht, or whether or not tales of at least one failed attempt to return prior to the events of that poem existed. Dietrichs Flucht is sometimes seen as a stringing together of the same episode (Dietrich's failed return from exile) by the poet in order to expand his material. The scholar Norbert Voorwinden has suggested that the entire poem is the invention of an author inspired by the Italian campaigns of Emperor Frederick II.

UBH Cpg 314 fol. 162r. Die Rabenschlacht (The Battle of Ravenna) is an anonymous 13th-century Middle High German poem about the hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. It is part of the so-called \\"historical\\" Dietrich material and is closely related to, and always transmitted together with, a second Dietrich poem, Dietrichs Flucht. At one time, both poems were thought to have the same author, possibly a certain Heinrich der Vogler, but stylistic differences have led more recent scholarship to abandon this idea. Die Rabenschlacht concerns a failed attempt by the exiled Dietrich to reclaim his kingdom in Northern Italy from his treacherous uncle Ermenrich, with the help of an army provided by Etzel, king of the Huns. In the course of this attempt, Dietrich's younger brother and Etzel's young sons by his wife Helche are killed by Dietrich's former vassal Witege outside of Ravenna. Witege then flees into the sea and is rescued by a mermaid rather than fighting against Dietrich. The poem may be a dim reflection of the death of Attila's son Ellac at the Battle of Nedao in 454, combined with Theoderic the Great's siege of Ravenna in 491‚Äì493. It would therefore be one of the oldest parts of the legends about Dietrich von Bern. Summary Die Rabenschlacht begins a year after the end of Dietrichs Flucht, with Dietrich still in exile at the court of Etzel. Dietrich is still saddened by the loss of his men in the previous poem, especially Alphart. Etzel announces that he will give Dietrich a new army, and there is a large feast to celebrate Dietrich's marriage to Herrad, niece of his wife Helche. Helche, however, is troubled by a dream in which a wild dragon carries away her two sons and rips them to shreds. so Helche cheers him up with a large feast in honor of his marriage to Herrat. However, she is troubled by a dream that her two sons are abducted by a dragon. Meanwhile, a new army is assembled at Etzelburg. Helche and Etzel's sons Orte and Scharpfe beg Helche to be allowed to join the army. Etzel and Dietrich come in upon this conversation, and Etzel categorically refuses. Dietrich, however, promises to take good care of the young princes, so that Helche agrees and Orte and Scharpfe join the army. The army arrives in Italy, where it is greeted by Dietrich's loyal vassals who have remained there after the last campaign. Dietrich learns that Ermenrich has assembled a large army at Ravenna. The army heads to Bern (Verona), where Dietrich's young brother Diether has remained. Dietrich decides to leave Etzel's children with Diether in the care of the older warrior Elsan, and marches to Ravenna. The children, however, under the pretext of viewing the city, convince a reluctant Elsan to let them leave the city. They get lost and end up on the road to Ravenna, while Elsan looks for them in despair. Once the young warriors have spent a night outside the city, they reach the shore of the sea. In the dawn they encounter Witege. Diether tells Etzel's children that Witege is a warrior who betrayed Dietrich, and the three young warriors attack. Witege slays each of them in difficult combat; he is deeply distressed and laments Diether's death especially. Meanwhile, Dietrich fights a gruelling twelve-day battle outside Ravenna, defeating Ermenrich, who escapes. His treacherous advisor Sibeche, however, is captured by Eckehart, who ties him naked to a horse and leads him across the battlefield to avenge the death of the Harlungen at Sibeche's advice. As the dead are gathered to be buried, Ilsan arrives with news that Etzel's sons are missing. The warrior Helpfrich then comes with news of their deaths. Dietrich finds their bodies on the seashore and breaks into despairing laments. He recognizes that the wounds on the young warriors bodies could only have been made by Witege's sword Mimming. Witege is then spotted; Dietrich jumps on his horse to attack, but Witege flees on his horse Schemming. Witege's uncle Rienolt, however, is also with him, and he turns to fight Dietrich and is slain. Dietrich pursues Witege to the edge of the sea and very nearly catches him, but Witege rides into the sea where he is rescued by the sea-spirit Wachilt (identified by the Thidrekssaga as his great grandmother). She tells him that Dietrich was so hot with anger that his armor was soft, and Witige could have easily defeated him. Now, however, the armor had hardened, and thirty Witiges could not defeat Dietrich. Dietrich meanwhile mourns on the shore. He goes back to Ravenna, where Ermenrich has fortified himself, and storms the city. Ermernich escapes, however, and Dietrich orders the city burned, as the inhabitants surrender. R√ºdiger rides back to Hunland to bring Etzel the news of his sons deaths; however, Orte and Scharpfe's horses arrive at Etzelburg with bloody saddles. Helche is beside herself, but R√ºdiger is able to calm her. Etzel sees that his sons deaths are not Dietrich's fault, and Dietrich returns to Etzel's court and back into Etzel and Helche's good graces. Dating, creation, and transmission Die Rabenschlacht is transmitted together with Dietrichs Flucht in four complete manuscripts and alone in one fragmentary manuscript: *Riedegger Manuscript (R), Staatsbibliothek Berlin, Ms. germ 2o 1062, on parchment from the end of the thirteenth century, from Nieder√∂sterreich. Contains various literary texts. *Windhager Manuscript (W), √ñsterreichische Nationalbibliothek Vienna, Cod. 2779, parchment, first quarter of the fourteenth century, from Nieder√∂sterreich.

Various literary texts. * Universit√§tsbibliothek Graz, Ms. 1969 (S), parchment, mid fourteenth-century, in Austro-Bavarian dialect. Contains a fragment of Die Rabenschlacht. The origins of the earliest manuscripts as well as the dialect of the poem indicate that it was composed in Austria, sometime before 1300. Most modern scholarship holds Die Rabenschlacht to have been composed earlier than Dietrichs Flucht: Joachim Heinzle notes that Die Rabenschlacht contains allusions to Wolfram von Eschenbach's Willehlam (c. 1220) and cannot have been composed any earlier than that. Werner Hoffmann suggests that Die Rabenschlacht may have been composed around 1270, before being reworked and placed together with Dietrichs Flucht in the 1280s. Victor Millet questions whether Die Rabenschlacht is really an earlier work than Dietrichs Flucht, and Elisabeth Lienert suggests that the poems were actually composed at roughly the same time, though older versions of Die Rabenschlacht must have existed. As with almost all German heroic epic, Die Rabenschlacht is anonymous. Early scholarship believed that both Dietrichs Fluch and Die Rabenschlacht had a single author, Heinrich der Vogler; however, the formal and stylistic differences between the two epics have caused this theory to be abandoned. The manuscript transmission nevertheless makes clear that Die Rabenschlacht and Dietrichs Flucht were viewed as a single work by contemporaries. Someone, perhaps Heinrich der Vogler, has also reworked both texts to an extent so that their contents do not contradict each other.  Metrical form  Die Rabenschlacht consists of 1140 unique stanzas, in a form that is not found in any other poem. Like other stanzaic heroic poems, it was probably meant to be sung, but no melody survives. Heinzle analyzes the stanza as consisting of three \\"Langzeilen\\" with rhymes at the caesuras: ab, ab, cc. The first line consists of three metrical feet before the caesura, then three additional feet; the second of three feet before the caesura, then four additional feet; and the third of three feet before the caesura, and five or even six additional feet. Heinzle prints the following example as typical: :Welt ir in alten maeren a  wunder hoeren sagen, b :von recken lobebaeren, a  s√¥ sult ir gerne dar zuo dagen. b :von gr√¥zer herverte, c  wie der von Bern s√Æt s√Æniu lant erwerte c In some stanzas, the rhymes at the caesura in lines 1 and 2 are absent, giving a scheme: xb, xb, cc. It is also possible to interpret the stanza as consisting of six shorter lines, with rhyme scheme ABABCC. Consequently, the same stanza as above is printed in the edition by Elisabeth Lienert and Dorit Wolter as: :Welt ir in alten m√¶ren a :wnder horen sagen b :von rekchen lobew√¶ren, a :so sult ir gerne dar z≈Ø dagen. b :Von grozer herverte, c :wie der von Bern sit siniu lant erwerte c Genre and themes Die Rabenschlacht has been described as \\"elegiac\\" and \\"sentimental,\\" particularly in relation to Dietrichs Flucht. Stylistically, the poem is notable for its hyperbole in its depictions of violence‚Äîthe battle at Ravenna takes twelve days and the warriors literally wade in blood among mountains of corpses‚Äîand emotions, particularly of grief. The numbers of warriors involved are similarly exaggerated, with Ermenrich's army including 1,100,00 (eilf hundert t≈´sent) warriors or more. Neither Werner Hoffmann nor Victor Millet see the poem as particularly heroic, with Millet nevertheless noting that the poem does not criticize the use of violence. The poem makes numerous allusions to the Nibelungenlied, beginning with the opening stanza, which cites the opening stanza of the C version of the Nibelungenlied. Edward Haymes and Susan Samples suggest that the poem exists as a kind of prequel to the Nibelungenlied. In the course of the poem, characters from the Nibelungenlied fight on the side of Ermenrich, including Siegfried, Gunther and Volker, as well as their enemies from the Nibelungenlied, Liudegast and Liudeger. Siegfried is defeated by Dietrich and forced to plea for his life, confirming Dietrich's superiority. Michael Curschmann holds the encounters between Dietrich and Siegfried here and in the Rosengarten zu Worms to have their origins in an oral tradition. However, Elisabeth Lienert sees the battles in Die Rabenschlacht as part of a literary rivalry between the two traditions, an intertextual relationship. The poem includes allusions to other thirteenth- century literary texts as well, including Wolfram von Eschenbach's Willehalm. This confirms its nature as a literary text, in dialogue with other literature. Relation to oral tradition The general outline of the story told in ', about the death of Etzel and Herche's sons, is often considered to be one of the oldest components of the legend of Theoderic. It is first alluded to in the Nibelungenklage, a poem likely written shortly after the Nibelungenlied (c.1200). Older scholarship proposed a Gothic song as the earliest version. According to this theory, the song was inspired by the Battle of Nedao (454), a rebellion of Germanic tribes after the death of Attila the Hun, in which Attila's favorite son and successor Ellac died. Theoderic the Great's father Theodemar is thought to have fought on the side of the Huns in this battle, with his actions transferred to his more famous son in the oral tradition. Elisabeth Lienert suggests the poem's location at Ravenna may have been influenced by the historical Theoderic the Great besieging his enemy Odoacer there from 491 to 493. Witige's character is sometimes thought to have been influenced by Witigis, a Gothic king and usurper who surrendered Ravenna to the Byzantine army. Diether is similarly thought to have a connection to the historical Theodahad, whom Witigis betrayed, usurping the Ostrogothic throne. Werner Hoffmann suggests that Ermenrich's rather small role in Die Rabenschlacht is because the original tale of Witige killing Etzel's sons and Diether has been only roughly inserted into the larger framework of Dietrich's exile. Joachim Heinzle largely dismisses such attempts at deducing the roots of the poem as unfruitful. An alternative version of the events of the Rabenschlacht is found in the Old Norse Thidrekssaga. There we are told that King Ermanrik was misled into attacking his nephew Didrik because of his counsellor Sifka (Sibeche in Middle High German), who was avenging Ermanrik's rape of his wife by leading him to his doom. Didrik goes into exile at Attila's court and makes an attempt to return to his kingdom with a Hunnish army, bringing along his brother Thether (Diether) and Attila's two sons Erp and Ortwin. The army fights a mighty battle against Ermanrik at Gronsport on the Mosel and defeats him. During the battle, Wi√∞ga (Witege) kills Thether, Erp, and Ortwin; Didrik pursues Wi√∞ga, breathing fire, until the latter disappears in the (non-existent) mouth of the Mosel into the sea. Didrik throws his spear after Wi√∞ga, and one can still see it today. Didrik then returns to exile. Joachim Heinzle notes that it is unclear how much of the variation between the version found in Die Rabenschlacht and that found in the Thidrekssaga is the work of the latter's compiler or comes from alternative versions in oral circulation. The late medieval Heldenbuch-Prosa corroborates the Thidrekssaga's version of the story of why Sibeche betrayed Ermenrich, and it is clear that the composer of the Heldenbuch-Prosa did not have access to the Thidrekssaga. This indicates that at least some of the Thidrekssaga's changes may come from oral tradition, indicating the existence of multiple versions of the story. The scholar Norbert Voorwinden has suggested that the author of Die Rabenschlacht was largely unaware of the oral tradition, creating an entirely new work on the basis of an allusion to the death of Etzel's sons in the Nibelungenklage. Attempts have been made to connect the catalogues of warriors found in the work with signs of oral formulaic composition.

Woodcut from the printed Eckenlied by von Hans Schaur, Augsburg, 1491. Fol. 70v. Staatsbubliothek zu Berlin Inc. 321 8¬∞ Das Eckenlied or Ecken Ausfahrt (The Song of Ecke or Ecke's Quest) is an anonymous 13th- century Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. It is one of the so-called fantastical (aventiurehaft) Dietrich poems, so called because it more closely resembles a courtly romance than a heroic epic. The Eckenlied tells the story of Dietrich's fight against the giant Ecke, who has been sent out by three queens to fetch Dietrich. Dietrich is forced to kill Ecke, after which he must fight Ecke's family, particularly Ecke's treacherous and vengeful brother Fasold. The poem exists in at least three separate but closely related versions, which offer different endings to the tale. A fragmentary text known as Dietrich und Fasold may represent another version of the Eckenlied, but differences in meter and content make this uncertain. Fasold and the three queens may have originally been figures of Tyrolean folklore, while Ecke may have been invented to explain the name of Dietrich's sword, Eckesachs (sharp sword). The Eckenlied is the earliest poem about Dietrich attested (c. 1230) after his appearance in the Nibelungenlied. It was one of the most popular narratives about Dietrich throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period. It was first printed in 1490 and continued to be printed until the end of the 1500s. Summary Dietrich fights against Ecke. SLUB Dresden, Mscr. Dresden M. 201 fol. 91v. The Eckenlied begins with a conversion between three giants: Ecke, Fasold, and Ebenrot. Ecke proclaims that Dietrich von Bern is praised by everyone, while Ecke, despite having performed heroic deeds, is completely unknown. Ebenrot counters that Dietrich's reputation is a lie: the hero treacherously slew the giants Hilde and Grim while they were asleep to steal their armor. Fasold intervenes and says that Ebenrot is wrong: Dietrich slew Hilde and Grim because the giants would otherwise have killed him. Ecke decides to agree with Fasold. Meanwhile, three queens are on the mountain of Jochgrimm: one of them, Seburg wishes very much to see Dietrich, and hearing of Ecke's interest, asks him to bring the hero to her. To encourage Ecke not to kill Dietrich, Seburg gives Ecke a sword and armor hardened in dragon blood. It is the same armor that Emperor Ortnit wore when he rode out to fight dragons: Ortnit fell into a magic sleep, however, and was dragged away by a dragoness to her brood, which sucked his flesh out through the invincible armor. It was then recovered by Wolfdietrich, who killed the dragons, but himself had to go to a monastery to repent for his sins, being tortured by demons. From there Seburg got the armor. She tries to convince Ecke to take a horse, but he refuses. Ecke travels to Verona, but is directed to Tyrol. After coming upon a man mortally wounded by Dietrich, Hilferich von Lunders (possibly Londres, i.e. London; in other versions he is described as von Lune and von L√ºtringen, i.e. Lotharingia), he finally encounters Dietrich himself, and challenges him to combat. Dietrich refuses, saying Ecke has done him no wrong, and Ecke accuses him of cowardice (zagheit). At this Dietrich agrees to fight. Ecke and Dietrich fight for a long time, and Ecke tries to force Dietrich to surrender, but Dietrich refuses. Finally, Dietrich gains the upper hand, but Ecke also refuses to surrender. Due to Ecke's invincible armor, Dietrich is forced to stab the giant dishonorably through a gap in his armor. He then mourns Ecke at some length. Ecke asks Dietrich to cut off his head and bring it to Seburg, which he does. He then puts on the giant's armor and takes his sword. In the Landsberger version, a nymph named Vrou Babehilt binds his wounds. Triad of giantesses, included Ritsch from Eckenlied version E7. Runkelstein Castle near Bozen, c. 1400. After recovering some from his wounds, Dietrich encounters a woman running through the forest. She is being hunted by Fasold, who rides up and demands to know why Dietrich is interfering with his hunt. Fasold is described as having two long braided locks that hang down to his waist and which are woven in with iron. The giant decides not to fight the still gravely wounded Dietrich, apparently not recognizing his brother's armor or seeing Ecke's head. Dietrich falls asleep while the maiden watches. However, Fasold changes his mind and returns in the night ‚Äì the maiden is barely able to rouse Dietrich before Fasold appears with his hounds. The two fight, and Dietrich overcomes Fasold by cutting off his braided locks, and the giant surrenders. However, he then recognizes his brother's armor and Dietrich admits to having killed Ecke, and the two fight once more. Dietrich accuses Fasold of fighting with the strength of two men, saying Ecke's spirit has entered the giant, at which Fasold counters that Diether's spirit must have entered Dietrich, he is so strong. At the memory of Witige's treachery, Dietrich is enraged and finally overcomes Fasold, sparing him only at the insistence of the maiden. At this point the three texts diverge ‚Äì in all, Fasold treacherously leads Dietrich to members of his family in hopes that they will kill him, taking him to the giant Eckenot (whose name may be a corruption of Ebenrot or vice versa) and then to two or three giantesses, variously Ecke's mother, aunt, or sisters. The oldest nearly complete version, E2 breaks off at this point. In the remaining two complete versions E7 and e1, Dietrich finally kills Fasold for his treacherous behavior In version E7, which is probably the original ending, he then rides into Jochgrimm and throws the head of Ecke at the feet of Seburg, saying that she is the cause of Ecke's pointless death. In version e1, Seburg reveals that she sent Ecke to his death deliberately, since he and his brothers were going to force them into marriage. It also mentions that, with Ecke's sword Dietrich later slew Odoacer when called upon to do so by Emperor Zeno. Transmission, versions, and dating Eckenlied stanza at the top of the page, in the Codex Buranus (c. 1230). This is the oldest transmission of the Eckenlied or of any Dietrich poem. BSB Clm 4660 fol. 90v. The Eckenlied is transmitted in numerous manuscripts and printed versions, beginning in 1230. The poem was likely composed shortly before that time, possibly in Tyrol. As with almost all German heroic epic, it is anonymous. It was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich. In common with all fantastical Dietrich poems, the Eckenlied is characterized by a great deal of variation in its transmission, so that each manuscript essentially represents an parallel and equally valid version of the poem. The three principle versions are E2 (c. 1300, incomplete), E7 (1472), and e1 (printed 1491). The oldest attestation, E1, a single stanza in the Codex Buranus, appear to show that the poem existed in a much shorter version, beginning with Ecke's encounter with Dietrich in the forest. It is possible that this is the original beginning of the poem, with everything before this encounter being added later. Although version E7 is from the fifteenth century, various fragments and depictions in Runkelstein Castle make it likely that similar versions existed in the first half of the fourteenth century. Similarly, parts of a version similar to the incomplete E2 were copied into a printed text of the Eckenlied by fifteenth century scribe Konrad Bollstatter. All versions thus existed at the same time and should be treated equally. Each manuscript or print is listed below according to the version of the Eckenlied it contains as named by Joachim Heinzle.

There follow more than eleven further printings into the sixteenth century and beyond. The fragmentary Dietrich und Fasold is transmitted on three small strips of a manuscript from around 1300 that were used as bookbinding in Nieders√§chsische Landesbibliothek Hanover MS VII 626. Themes The Eckenlied is often interpreted as a critique of courtly love service: Ecke foolishly rides out on behalf of Seburg, which results in his death and extreme hardship for Dietrich. Dietrich's zagheit (cowardice), a common motif in the fantastical Dietrich poems, functions here as a criticism of Ecke's insistence on fighting. Victor Millet sees in this criticism a disavowal of the knightly battles on behalf of women commonly portrayed in courtly romance. On the other hand, version e1 removes any criticism of love service and thus moves the epic much closer to romance. At the same time, Dietrich's brutal killing of Ecke casts heroic battle in a bad light, except in version E7, where Dietrich's innocence is emphasized to a greater degree. Particularly the opening conversation of the poem is frequently seen as a metaliterary discussion about the status of Dietrich as a hero: Ecke, Fasolt, Ebenrot, and Seburg all desire to verify Dietrich's fame, in the same manner as the audience might. The Eckenlied also alludes to themes from the historical Dietrich poems, particularly events recounted in the Rabenschlacht: when Dietrich fights Fasold, Fasold taunts Dietrich with the death of Dietrich's brother Diether and Etzel's sons at the hands of Witege. Fasold implicitly compares Dietrich to Witege, as Fasold seeks to avenge his own brother's death. Meanwhile, Dietrich's successful defeat of Fasold avenges his failure to avenge his own brother and also allows him to get past his problematic victory over Ecke. Dietrich's defeat of the giants, who can be seen as personifying injustice, helps prove his qualities as an ideal ruler, something which e1 explicitly connects to the historical Theoderic's defeat of Odoacer and rule in Italy. Older scholarship believed that the Eckenlied had been heavily influenced by an Old French Arthurian romance \\"Le Chevalier du Papagau,\\" in which Arthur fights against a similar giant antagonist. An earlier \\"native\\" poem about Ecke would thus have been rewritten to incorporate plot elements from this romance. More recent scholarship has abandoned this connection, viewing the similarities as superficial. Metrical Form Like the majority of German heroic epics, the Eckenlied is written in stanzas. The poem is composed in a stanza form known as the \\"Berner Ton,\\" which consists of 13 lines in the following rhyme scheme: aabccbdedefxf. It shares this metrical form with the poems Goldemar, Sigenot, and Virginal. Early modern melodies for the \\"Berner Ton\\" have survived, indicating that it was meant to be sung. Heinzle gives the first stanza of the Eckenlied as a typical example: : a (four feet) : a (four feet) : b (three feet) : c (four feet) : c (four feet) : b (three feet) : d (four feet) : e (three feet) : d (four feet) : e (three feet) : f (four feet) : x (three feet) : f (three feet) In the earliest version, E1, there is a slight variation in how the stanza is put together, with the lines pattern instead as: aabccbxexefxf. Heinzle interprets this to mean that the lines without rhymes were originally the first half of a caesura in a \\"Langzeile,\\" the same line unit used in the Nibelungenlied. This features three or four feet, a caesura, then an additional three or four feet, depending on placement in the stanza. Printed this way, the stanza from the Codex Buranus (cited according to Vollmann's edition) appears thus: : a : a : b : c : c : b : x  da si an ander funden e : x  den walt also unchunden. e : f : x  daz was niht wolgetan. f Dietrich und Fasold appears to be written either in the same stanza as the Nibelungenlied, or else in the \\"Hildebrandston\\"‚Äîit is not clear from the fragmentary nature of the text. Relation to the Oral Tradition The Eckenlied, together with Sigenot are the only attestations of a story- possibly a lost poem-about the giants Hilde and Grim, from whom Dietrich won his helmet, named \\"Hildegrim.\\" The tale is told in its entirely only in the Old Norse Thidrekssaga, which used German sources. It is also possible that there may never have been a written poem about Hilde and Grim; the tale may have been a purely oral one and well known to the Eckenlied's and Sigenot's audience. The poem is often interpreted as an explanation of the name of Dietrich's sword, Eckesachs. This originally meant \\"sword with a sharp edge\\", but when ecke took on the meaning it has in modern German (corner), the name was reinterpreted as meaning \\"the sword of Ecke\\". The name Eckesachs never appears in the text however, though the sword is referred to as \\"Hern Ecken sachs\\" (Sir Ecke's sword). Eckesachs was apparently famous enough to be referenced in Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneis (c. 1186), which predates the Eckenlied. Heinzle does not believe that this early mention is any proof of an oral story about Ecke. Whether or not Ecke has a long existence in oral tradition, Fasolt and Seburg are more commonly supposed to have. They are commonly connected to a 17th-century prayer to witches at the mountain Jochgrimm outside of Bozen to cause \\"ffasolt\\" to send storms far away. This would make the three queens in the Eckenlied into witches with power over the weather, while Fasolt would be a storm demon. Fasolt's long hair is also taken as evidence of his demonic origins: The name Fasolt likely derives from a root similar to Old High German faso, thread, and most likely refers to his long braided hair. If this interpretation is correct, than Fasolt and Ecke were not originally brothers, but Ecke was inserted into a much older story. Heinzle, however, dismisses the weather prayer: its source is unclear and neither is it clear that \\"ffasolt\\" is the same as the Fasolt found in the Eckenlied Fasolt may also be a sort of reversal of versions of a legend in which Dietrich von Bern is leader of the Wild Hunt and hunts women in the forest: Dietrich instead fights against an opponent with this characteristic, as he also does in the Wunderer and Virginal. Further evidence for an oral version of the tale might be provided by the Ekka episode Thidrekssaga, which differs in crucial details in both its treatment of Ecke and Fasold. Additionally, the fragmentary Dietrich und Fasold appears to match neither the meter nor the content of the Eckenlied. Particularly because of the version found in the Thidrekssaga, Victor Millet believes that it is highly likely that there were oral tales circulating about Ecke. Heinzle, however, is doubtful that any such oral tradition exists: he suggests rather that the Ekka episode was altered by the compiler of the Thidrekssaga. Reception The Eckenlied was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich, with one or possibly two of Dietrich's giantess opponents from the Dresden version being included to in the frescoes at Runkelstein Castle (c. 1400). Ecke is frequently mentioned as Dietrich's opponent when authors make allusions to the legends about Dietrich. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the poem even seems to have inspired a saying, \\"Ecke ist an den Berner geraten\\" (Ecke has met the Berner [i.e. Dietrich]), meaning that someone has met their match.

The two had previously run a cigar counter and billiard academy for 23 years in the same neighborhood, and by the time they opened the Valley Arena, Rainault was a promoter who had previously organized fights in Hartford, Troy, and West Springfield. Rainault's career as a promoter would really begin after 1920, when the Commonwealth officially legalized boxing, theretofore an underground sport. On August 11, 1925, Valley Arena, Inc. was formally incorporated,[Query- \\"Valley Arena\\"], Massachusetts Corp. Card Search, Corporation Cards of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Commonwealth and by October 23, 1925, the company had purchased an old brick gasholder house from the City of Holyoke's municipal gas works. The sale at the time was listed in the register of deeds as a land sale as the gasholder house had been previously decommissioned in 1915, was briefly considered as a site for a new public bathhouse, but had remained unoccupied since. After 3 months of construction, the new converted Valley Arena Gardens debuted with their first fight on February 8, 1926 with a match between one \\"Petey\\" Mack and Leo \\"Kid\\" Roy. On June 13, 1943, at approximately 2am, the first of three fires in the Arena's history broke out. An hour after owner Homer Rainault left the building, local patrolmen reported seeing flames billowing out of the building. Starting on the first floor and filling all reaches, the fire caused between an estimated $150‚Äì200 thousand dollars (approx. $2.1 to 2.5 million in 2017 USD). The building was insured however, but only for $100,000 dollars; in the weeks following the fire, owner Homer Rainault expressed doubts over rebuilding. Ultimately Rainault decided to rebuild, and used the Holyoke War Memorial Building as a music venue for the remainder of the year, hosting a number of artists, including The Ink Spots, during this time. Fights continued at a local club in Springfield and by August of that year, Rainault had put everything in place to rebuild. Eight months after the devastating fire, the venue reopened on February 28, 1944 with a 10 round match between bantamweight champion Louis Salica and one Mario Colon, a rising star from Mexico. In 1944, the Arena's founder Homer Rainault died unexpectedly from a cerebral hemorrhage at the age of 58; by that time he had gained a reputation as a promoter for giving many nationally famous boxers their start in the Connecticut Valley. The board of directors ultimately voted for his nephew, Oreal D. Rainault to take his place. Rainault would eventually sell the venue in 1952 to two businessmen, Jack and Ralph Kane of Norfolk, Virginia; making it clear that this sale was only partial as he retained stock in the company.\\" Holyoke Fire Dept. fighting the Arena's final fire on May 12, 1960; from the front page of the Springfield Union. Even before the second fire, the venue had begun to see a decline in its attendance for boxing matches as television gained popularity while stage shows and events that relied on audience attendance saw shrinking numbers across the country. On November 11, 1952, the boxing matchmaker, Joe Di Maria, resigned due to dwindling crowds that season. In contrast with its boxing, by the end of 1952, concerns had been raised by Holyoke police and fire departments about overcrowding at the venue's night club. On December 23, the police and fire chiefs held a conference stating that maximum capacities would be discussed with and enforced by the Arena's management, denying rumors that the venue was being given a pass. Mosaics of boxers can be seen above the doors of the inner entrance, as the building's burnt-out ruins were razed. Only three days after that press conference, on December 26, 1952, the second started in the Circus Lounge of that building in the early hours of the morning. Future Holyoke fire chief William W. Mahoney, then a member of one of the companies which fought the fire, later went on to describe it as \\"one of the most vicious fires for smoke conditions [he'd] ever seen,\\" severe enough that an eye doctor had to set up a first aid station at the scene. The three-alarm fire quickly spread, and led to tenants across South Holyoke being roused from their beds in case of a possible evacuation. In total the fire caused an estimated $250,000 of damages (approx. $2.3 million in 2018 USD), and injured 6 firefighters. The fire had begun in the basement, and with the premises flooded for several days, firefighters were not immediately able to determine its cause. While formal inquests were made and hours of testimony given by the owners and multiple employees under oath, conflicting accounts were found and the fire was deemed \\"of unknown but suspicious origin\\" by the state police captain tasked with its investigation. While the city had allowed boxing to continue in the Holyoke War Memorial building during the previous fire, this was not the case the second time. Before Jack Kane or anyone else associated with the arena could approach the War Memorial Commission, their chairman Thomas Epstein introduced a motion, passed unanimously, opposing the use of the hall for wrestling or boxing matches. The venue would reopen following its last reconstruction, on September 28, 1953. After the final fire on May 12, 1960, Oreal Rainault elected not to not attempt rebuilding the venue. Following a prolonged period where the burnt-out ruins of the building sat vacant, the Valley Arena Gardens were demolished throughout the month of August, 1964. =Boxing= While it hosted many well known musicians and other sporting events, the Arena was best remembered as a boxing venue, where many champions across multiple weight classes got their start in their early professional careers. Among the many other household names who would fight in the ring, were Beau Jack, Willie Pep, Kid Kaplan, Lou Ambers, Billy Petrolle, Jack Delaney, Frankie Genaro, Sandy Saddler, Rocky Graziano, Ike Williams, and Ernie Schaaf. Jersey Joe Walcott, best known as the oldest man to ever win the world heavyweight championship title at the age of 37 (prior to George Foreman's win at 45 in 1994), also fought in the Arena for an exhibition match.Left Hook Stops Charles in 7th, Makes Walcott Oldest Champ, 1951, The Milwaukee Journal More than two decades after the venue had burnt down, World Featherweight Champion Willie Pep was quoted as saying \\"it was a breeding place...anybody who was anybody boxed there.\\" One Mike Cipriano, a New York promoter who managed Jake LaMotta and Harry LaSane, described it as \\"a little Madison Square Garden...the arena was known from coast to coast‚Äîthey'd sell out almost every week...it was nothing for a bunch of us to pile into a car and head for Holyoke...If you didn't fight in Holyoke, you weren't a fighter\\" The Arena hosted the first match in the continental United States of Sixto Escobar, the first Puerto Rican to win a world title. On May 7, 1934, Escobar, a bantamweight, defeated bantamweight contender and Canadian flyweight champion Bobby Leitham, in a fight that made headlines in local papers and was described as a \\"dramatic upset\\". The match of 10 rounds was ended abruptly in the seventh, when a referee realized the extent to which Leitham's left eye had been hemorrhaged by a sharp right overhand which had also left a gash across his cheek. Escobar was declared winner of the match by technical knockout. The Arena hosted Rocky Marciano's professional debut in the ring, as a 4-round opener against Holyoke native Lee (real name Leslie V.) Epperson on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1947. In the first professional bout of his career the Brockton native, then stationed in the air force at Westover, was billed as \\"Rocky Mackianno of Westover Field\\" or \\"Rocky Mac\\" for short. Having been set up for the opening fight by a friend who had known Rainault, Marciano managed to hold on for the first two rounds as Epperson landed several blows as his own missed. The match came to an abrupt end however, 42 seconds into the third round when Marciano landed a sharp right uppercut, knocking his opponent through the ropes and out of the ring. Because the fight predated Marciano's continuous professional career by about a year, and he had been billed under a slightly different name, it remained entirely obscure until later in the heavyweight's career. After retiring, Marciano would make a second appearance at the venue a decade later, serving as a referee. Brought on at the invitation of boxing promoter Sam Silverman, it would be billed as his \\"Eastern Debut\\" in such a capacity- his only previous referee role being at a venue in New Orleans. =Music= The Indian Pine Room at the Valley Arena Gardens, c. 1944-1950 Even as its boxing lineups struggled to draw crowds in the 1950s, the venue continued to promote weekly music performances drawing from stars who'd grown popular through the growing mediums of radio and television; with this one featuring Frances Langford, Cab Calloway, Tommy Reynolds. Throughout nearly the entirety of its existence the Arena booked many famous musicians for its night club, which featured its own in-house orchestra. Spanning generations, it hosted many famous musicians across several genres, including jazz, blues, big band, country, soul, and rock & roll with such names as- Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Wee Bonnie Baker, The Dorsey Brothers, The Ink Spots, Lionel Hampton, Roy Rogers, The Glenn Miller Orchestra, Sarah Vaughan, The Temptations, Shep Fields, and Jack Teagarden. The venue was known both as a regular stop for big band musicians, and an arduous gig among acts in the 1950s. In a 1986 interview, Woody Herman alumni Jack E. DuLong, a saxophonist, described it as \\"that infamous job that all bands hated, that all-day thing at the Holyoke Arena...It was Sunday, and you'd get in early in the morning, and rehearse perhaps a dozen acts and play three shows; one in the afternoon and two in the evening. You would start rehearsing in the morning without even an hour's sleep. It was a theater-in- the-round type thing, an 'institution' for big bands. After there we went into Brooklyn, New York, for a theater engagement.\\" =Other= The Arena also served as a venue for regular vaudeville shows as well, and several known stage actors including noted impersonator Larry Blake, and Bela Lugosi, of Dracula fame. In 1942, the venue found itself at the center of a political controversy when the mayor of Holyoke at that time, Henry J. Toepfert instituted a ban on all vaudeville acts on Sundays, building on previous Massachusetts blue laws that prevented dancing or the use of \\"grotesque\\" costumes on Sundays. The Arena had however already booked several such acts for Sundays from prior contracts, and was allowed by the city to continue them, despite protest from other venues in the city. The Arena was also host to a number of well-known comedians. On three occasions, October 5, 1947, November 23, 1947 and April 30, 1950, The Three Stooges, Moe, Larry, and Shemp, gave performances at the venue. On an unknown date in the summer of 1950, comedian Lenny Bruce reportedly did a set. Comic Jerry Colonna would also perform at the Arena in 1946 and briefly made news when Oreal Rainault sued him for a second show at Riverside Park in Agawam. A prior contract had stipulated he not perform at any venue within 21 miles for 21 days before or after their booked show. While a temporary injunction was granted, it was ultimately dismissed. * Among other early sporting events hosted at the Arena, the venue also served as the home for the local amateur basketball league's \\"All-Valley Team\\", which included at least two players who had been invited to play in the American Basketball League. Wrestling was also a common event at the venue, with such names as Arnold Skaaland, Angelo Savoldi, Chief Don Eagle, and Bull Curry. Valley Arena Park The land where the venue once stood was sold to the city by the Rainault family in 1968Parcel 029-05-012, Holyoke Assessor's Database and was converted initially into space for a playground Within a year's time these plans were expanded into a playground and wading pool with bathhouse, with construction beginning in 1969. The park reopened in 1970. Despite being the site of a former gasworks, a comprehensive environmental assessment taken from 2004 through 2005 of the soils at the site found no contamination of the site inconsistent with background noise typically found in urban soils.

She is Mission Lead for the Mars Curiosity rover.  Education  Trujillo was born Jan 4 1980 in Cali in Colombia. Her mother was at medical school when she became pregnant with Trujillo, and left her studies to look after her daughter. Trujillo attended Colegio Internacional Ca√±averales Colegio Biling√ºe, bilingual school accredited by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) whilst working as a maid to raise money. She immigrated to the United States at the age of seventeen with only $300. She started English lessons at the Miami Dade College and worked as a housekeeper to support her studies. She eventually transferred to the University of Florida to continue her studies in engineering. Here, she was encouraged to apply for the NASA Academy, where she was the first immigrant Hispanic woman on the program. She went on to be one of only two people from her NASA Academy cohort to be employed by NASA. Whilst at the NASA Academy, Trujillo visited the University of Maryland where she helped Professor Brian Roberts research how robots would operate in space. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering the University of Maryland in 2007. Her story was turned into a children's science book by Kari Cornell and Fatima Khan. She was a member of Sigma Gamma Tau.  Career  Trujillo joined NASA in 2008, working at Goddard Space Flight Center on the Constellation program and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory on human and robotic space missions. She has served many roles, including Surface Sampling System Activity Lead and Dust Removal Tool Lead Systems Engineer. She was responsible for ensuring Curiosity's sampling fulfilled its science objectives dust-free whilst maintaining operational safety. The Dust Removal Tool took her six months to develop, and brushes the dust of the surface of Mars to allow scientists to investigate the surface below. It was used on Curiosity's 151st day on Mars.

In Nigeria, several subsequent governments have implemented different policies in an attempt to develop the rural areas and alleviate the poverty rate that has become a prominent decadence in such areas. However, very little success has been recorded so far. The first National Development plan spanned between the years 1962‚Äì1968, with agriculture being the major priority. The major objective was developing and expanding the production and export of cash crops. But this plan only provided 42% of the capital budget to Agriculture. In 1970, the second national development plan was launched by General Yakubu Gowon and it lasted until 1974. Its focus was on balancing the difference between rural and urban development while making an attempt to rectify some of the shortcomings that trailed the first development plan.

However, the Nigerian government is also investigating claims that Innoson Motors is guilty of fraud. Innoson Motors began its case against GT Bank in 2011. Recently, the Nigerian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Innoson Motors claim against GT Bank, and the company says that it is due to take over GT Bank in lieu of receiving its money. The scandal received publicity after the arrest of the Innonson chairman by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Innoson took the dispute to social media, with hashtags such as #BewareOfGTBank and #WhatIsWrongWithGTBank. In a TVC News interview, Innocent Chukwuma said that he had obtained an ‚Ç¶8 billion judgement against the bank. In 2009, GTBank extended credit to Innoson; under loan terms agreed to by Chukwuma on behalf of Innoson, proprietary interest in imported goods was exclusively that of the bank. The original shipping documents were in the bank's custody, and ownership could only be transferred to Innoson (or any other third party) by the bank when the conditions of the agreement were fulfilled. Chukwuma approached the bank on behalf of Innoson for the documents, and was refused due to Innoson's failure to meet the agreed conditions; however, the bank noticed in June 2011 that the imported goods had been procured by Innoson without their consent. The bank‚Äôs endorsement of the bills of lading to the shipping line had been forged. GTBank reported the forgery to the Nigeria Police Force, who began an investigation. After a forensic examination of the disputed signatures, the police established that the signatures of the bank‚Äôs staff were forged and the imported goods were fraudulently cleared from the Nigerian Ports Authority. According to a 10 November 2017 Innoson Group press release, the company was a GTBank customer. The issue dated back to 2012, when the bank \\"arbitrarily imposed and debited [their] current account in excessive and unlawful charges\\". Innoson sued GTBank, and several judgements were appealed by both sides. In 2013/2014, GTBank owed Innoson Motors up to ‚Ç¶8.5 billion. Innoson's claims on the judgement were debunked in media reports, with journalists covering the story confirming that the company's only judgement against Guaranty Trust Bank was obtained at the Federal High Court in Awka (which controversially awarded Innoson ‚Ç¶4.7 billion). Its appeal has been pending at the Court of Appeal in Enugu for several years, due to Innoson's efforts to block the hearing. A 25 December 2017 Innoson press release stated that GTBank had never granted Innoson a ‚Ç¶2.4 billion 2009 loan, but a ‚Ç¶500 million loan in an offer letter dated 17 December 2009; their last loan transaction was in 2011. The principal terms and security for the loan were: legal/tripartite legal mortgage over Innoson‚Äôs properties, valued at ‚Ç¶1.1 billion in 2010 by GTB-appointed appraisers; a 25-percent equity contribution by Innoson on each letter-of- credit (LC) transaction, and shipping documents worth ‚Ç¶500 million could be released at any time to Innoson. On 13 June 2018, Innoson admitted distorting the Supreme Court directive in its case with GTBank and apologised for misleading the public with their false claim of a Supreme Court Order against Guaranty Trust Bank. Investigation A Nigeria Police Force investigation following a September 2013 petition by the bank confirmed that Innoson and Chukwuma deliberately set out to defraud, steal from the bank and convert the imported goods belonging to the bank through forgery and misrepresentation, and Chukwuma was charged by the police. EFCC Chukwuma was arrested at his home in Enugu on 19 December 2017 and interrogated in Lagos about the alleged scandal. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission said that Chukwuma was arrested for fraud at the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and for forging documents to obtain tax waivers. The company denied the allegations, saying that the EFCC had never investigated Innoson. Courts In January 2018, Justice Mojisola Dada ordered the EFCC to subpoena Chukwuma after his attorney attempted to justify his absence at the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja for his scheduled arraignment. According to the EFCC, the businessman was evading arrest. In June 2018, Ikeja Special Offences Court Judge Mojisola Dada ordered the arrest of Chukwuma wanted for failing to appear before the court for arraignment for the fifth time. Chukwuma had previously failed to appear in court on 17 January, 9 February, 14 March and 25 April. In 2014, a ‚Ç¶4.7 billion judgment was awarded to Innoson by a judge at the Federal High Court in Awka. Guaranty Trust Bank immediately appealed the judgment, calling it \\"ridiculous\\" at the Court of Appeal in Enugu. The Court of Appeal asked the Bank to place the judgment in an interest-bearing escrow account with the court‚Äôs registrars. The bank balked, offering the court a guarantee instead and appealing to the Supreme Court. The bank's appeal was heard at the Supreme Court in Abuja on 7 June 2018.

Since the organization's founding in 1976 by two Canadian women, MATCH International has helped women's rights organizations in 71 countries with investments totalling $12 million for improvement of women and girls rights. In 2013, the organization re- launched under the name MATCH International Women's Fund with the same aim to invest in women and girls in the global South. As the only international women's fund in Canada, their motto is, \\"Holding Ground and Breaking Ground\\" on women's, girl's, and transgender rights. The organization's funding comes from individual donors, corporate partners, and the government of Canada. History Before 2013, the MATCH International Women's Fund was the MATCH Fund launched in 1976 by Dr. Norma E. Walmsley and Ms. Suzanne Johnson- HarvorMs Johnson-Harvor passed away in 2016. A commemoration can be found at http://matchinternational.org/suzanne/ with similar objectives of supporting women's movements worldwide. They became inspired to found an organization that supports grassroots women's organizations in the global South after attending the 1975 UN Conference for Women in Mexico City. The MATCH Fund was the first organization of its kind that 'matched' the needs of Canadian women with the similar needs in the global South, as well as being the first international nongovernmental organization that focused on women in the global south. In 2010, the Fund was on the verge of closing due to severe budget cuts from the Canadian International Development Agency, but never did. After reevaluating its role in the ever-changing landscape of women's rights and development work, the Fund concluded that there was still an organizational need for a focus on grassroots women's movements in developing countries. In 2011, with the help of donor support and the World University Service of Canada, the MATCH International Women's Fund underwent its rebranding to become Canada's first international women's fund with a focus on social innovation. In 2013, the Fund relaunched as MATCH International Women's Fund, the first and only Canadian Fund focused on women. This successful rebranding was possible because of their heightened voice thanks to corporate brand developers and public relations and advertisement firms. The feminist organization has partnered with 71 countries and more than 650 organizations since its founding. =Structure= At the head of operations of MATCH International Women's Fund is President and CEO, Jess Tomlin, who joined the organization in 2012 and has led the MATCH International Fund into its new phase. She is followed by a Vice President of Finance and Operations, Vice President of Capital Development, and Vice President of Global Programs. Other key positions are Finance Office, Senior Communication Strategist, Financial Analyst, Executive Coordinator, Development Assistant, Manager Global Programs, and Policy Lead. The Fund has a Board of Directors who is composed of a Chair, Vice-Chair and Secretary, Treasurer, and nine Directors. The MATCH International's Women's Fund's structure is also composed of an Advisory Council with a total of fifteen members with diverse expertise in women's rights, leadership, media, innovation, entrepreneurship, and peace and security; specific names can be found on the MATCH International website. =Funding= As a non-profit, non-governmental organization, the Fund obtains its founding from private individual Canadian donors, other Canadian organizations and foundations, and the Federal government of Canada. The money from their funding is brought directly to the women's organizations that they provide grants to. The Fund's financial highlights can be found on the non- profit organization's 2016-2017 Strength in Numbers Report. Individual donors The MATCH International Women's Fund's funding comes from individual Canadian donors. Last year, the MATCH private donors contribute almost $2 million to their annual budget. Private sector The MATCH International Women's Fund has corporate partners including Cairns O'Neil Strategic Media, Citizen Relations, The Colony Project, and Fish Out of Water Design Inc., Eastern Ontario Women in Finance, and Telus Corporation. The MATCH International Women's Fund considers its high impact private sector partners vital to its success, especially during its rebranding and 2013 launch. Foundations The MATCH International Women's Fund also has donor foundations including Foundations Canadian Federation of University Women, Elementary Teachers‚Äô Federation of Ontario, Foundation for a Just Society, Institute for International Women‚Äôs Rights - Manitoba, LesLois Shaw Foundation, McLean Smits Foundation, Sisters of St. Joseph of the Diocese of London Foundation, Terrace Women and Development Collective, The Red Butterfly Foundation, The Cloverleaf Foundation, University of Winnipeg Foundation, Wellspring Advisors, Women‚Äôs Executive Network Foundation. Canadian government The MATCH International Women's Fund, as well as other women's organizations like the Nobel Women‚Äôs Initiative, have been pressuring the Canadian federal government to fund international grassroots organizations for women's advancement. In 2017, the Trudeau government announced a new feminist international development policy as part for the Canadian foreign aid program that would find new ways to reach smaller organizations and groups while being accountable to the taxpayers. Both organizations advocated for these small amounts to grassroots organizations to be passed through their non-profit organizations. =Mission= The MATCH International Women's Fund's motto is \\"Holding Ground and Breaking Ground\\". This is linked to their mission that is the support small grassroots women's organizations that are holding ground and breaking ground in their respective country. By changing societal beliefs, opening barriers and systems through funding of other organizations, MATCH International Fund's mission is to improve women, girls, and transgender rights. President and CEO, Jess Tomlin, explains \\"Our mandate is to get money into the hands of women‚Äôs organizations who are really working at the community level, and we‚Äôre particularly curious about investing in disruptive and innovated organizations\\". =Values= The non-governmental organization's (NGO) values include courage, ambition, tenacity, feminisms, innovation, agility, and collaboration, with the ultimate goal to put a stop to discrimination and violence against women and girls. Activities The main activities of MATCH International Women's Fund includes the funding of grassroots organizations worldwide, sharing the stories of these organizations and the women behind them. By funding grassroots organizations and sharing their stories, MATCH International Women's Fund brings change in more than 25 countries. =Grants= The MATCH International Women's Fund is a new model of giving as it supports women's rights work globally through funding. The MATCH International Women's Fund's main activity is to support grassroots women's organizations in developing countries through the giving of grants. These capacity building grants are given to small organizations that work towards systematic change through collaboration and innovation, or through services and programs that promote and sustain women's rights. These grants range between 10,000 CAD to 20,000 CAD and proposals for grant demands are open once a year. These grants to grassroots organizations allow for flexible funding as the partners directly communicate with the Fund's staff for their needs. The MATCH Fund's responsive funding to these grassroots organizations allows for new innovative ideas and resistance. The Fund also seeks to magnify the voices of their partners by sharing their stories, promoting their work, connecting to opportunities, and support. =Campaigns= The MATCH International Women's Fund most prominent advocacy campaign is the #NoWomanFairytale, which is focused on three important topics: child marriage, rapeand female genital mutilation. By funding and partnering with different gras-root women organizations worldwide, the MATCH Fund want to alleviate these controversial practices. Each story ends with \\"And, little by little, the harmful practice of child marriage/rape/female genital mutilation came to an end\\", thanks to the work of women in grass-root organizations, which MATCH funds. On the Fund's website, MATCH has created a \\"how many laws did you break today?\\" quiz that brings awareness to the socio-cultural differences between Canadian women and women in the Global South. By asking regular, banal questions such as \\"When you left your house today, did you tell a man where you‚Äôre going?\\" or \\"What did you wear to work today?\\" in order to show that in other parts of the world, fundamental human rights are denied. The quiz ends with a number of laws that the respondent would have broke in a country of the global south, along with the penalties of breaking those laws such as imprisonment, lashes, electric shocks, arbitrary arrests, death threats, harassment, and death. The quiz ends with MATCH asking for the respondent to pay their fine (i.e. a donation). Their #LotteryOfLife quiz, launched in 2016, aims to increase awareness on the life of women and girls in the global south. By taking this quiz based on some of your basic personal information (age, education, gender, etc.), the quiz tells you where you would be in the developing world. Another digital quiz found on the Fund's website titled \\"Why Are We Still Protesting This Sh*!?\\" (launched in 2017) questions one's knowledge on past and present women's marches and protests through pictures. At the end of the quiz, the fact that women have been fighting and activating for rights for decades is paralleled by women in the developing world this fighting for rights and against culturally adopted practices. These three quizzes above are part of MATCH's campaign for awareness have been taken by more than 550,000 people since their launches. A 2018 initiative can be found on the organization's website, it is titled Resting Stitch Face. This is another initiative to increase awareness of the issues, in this case sexism, that women face. Here, cross-stitch is used to write sexist sayings, once the saying is chosen, backgrounds and colours to personalize the saying are picked. Then, the possibility to share your personal cross-stitch on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest), download it or email it to yourself. =Social innovation= It was, President and CEO, Jess Tomlin that became interested in social innovation and the advantages it could bring to women's rights issues. The fact that MATCH is innovative makes it the \\"first social innovation fund for women globally\\". Instead of funding infrastructure and large organizations, the MATCH International Women's Fund believe that smaller grassroots women's organizations and their initiatives will bring about more meaningful change. As Muhungi and Edwards claim, the MATCH International Women's Fund is an innovation in itself as the first international fund focused on women in Canada. The non-governmental organization works with 25 organizations across the world by funding a variety of projects such as an organization that work with survivors of sexual violence in Mexico, an organization that creates LGBT documentaries in Georgia, an organization that created an app to help Rwandan women during pregnancy, or even women-led tourist initiatives. Other innovative solution for women issues is Kenya‚Äôs Boxgirls, an organization that trains girls in rural areas as a way to empower them. In India, Nidhi Goyal is a blind stand-up comedian that encourages equality and acceptance through her comedy, the MATCH International Women's Fund supported Nidhi in the creation of an application that connected disabled women to volunteer caregivers. Another innovation is the Mama Radio, a Congolese radio show about women issues that helps spread the word on rights, abuses, and equality. Membership =Win-Win Coalition & Win-Win Strategies= The MATCH International Women's Fund is also a founding member of the Win-Win Coalition, which advocates and supports for the empowerment and advancement of women by adding resources and by cross-sector collaboration. The Win-Win Strategies partners with the assets of funds and organizations to empower women globally through business. By using the knowledge and resources of funds and organizations with their own services of business building, such as connections, consultations, development, and building sectors. =Women's Funding Network= The MATCH International Women's Fund is a member of the Women's Funding Network (WFN), which is an international alliance made up of 145 women's funds.

Anthony McHugo was the prior when the Dominicans were formally expelled on 1 May 1698. Some remained and by the early 18th century they had reoccupied the priory. McHugo died there on 24 July 1711. The friars continued to live in the area, at Boula and at Gortanumera up to the 19th century. Part of the monastery was used as a Church of Ireland church in 1631.

Biography Fritz Cockerell (born 25 November 1889 in Munich, died 16 April 1965) was a German pioneer of motorcycle, automotive and engine construction. His real name was Friedrich Gockerell, but in his published patent documents, he is referred to as Fritz Cockerell. Fritz Cockerell initially worked as a machinist in an airship factory and later in steam turbine construction at Maffei. He then moved to Rapp Motorenwerke, which later became Bayerische Motorenwerke (BMW), where he worked as a test engineer. Later, with Hans Meixner and Otto Landgraf, he founded the Megola works in Munich for the production of the Megola motorcycle. This was characterized by a five-cylinder rotary engine in the front wheel and around 2,000 units were built. The Megola was added to the temporary exhibition \\"The art of the motorcycle\\" by the Guggenheim Museum in 1998. Cockerell operated the Cockerell Fahrzeugwerke and developed in-house an eight-cylinder two-stroke engine for a \\"German people- determined sports car\\" and a four-cylinder two-stroke engine, which was used for installation in a few prototypes of a car and a two-wheeler. Cockerell was more successful with auxiliary bike engines and light motorcycles, which were considered very reliable and sold under his own name. He later devoted himself to research on diesel engines for aircraft, turbine engines and the Wankel engine.

The original location and time of construction of the original castle is unknown. Some scholars claim it may have been built in the 11th century, at the same time as the ch√¢teaux of La Chaize-le-Vicomte and Tiffauges, under the commission of the Viscount of Thouars, who had influence over what are today the northern parts of Vend√©e. The castle was constructed by Louis de Beaumont between the latter half of the 15th century and beginning of the 16th using white Sallertaine stone. In 1628, under orders from the cardinal de Richilieu, the castle was dismantled along with all other castles of its time in the region. It became property of historically protestant nobles, the de la Tr√©moille family. In 1926, the castle was registered as a historical monument. Each year, the organization ‚ÄúFriends of the old castle at Commequiers‚Äù organizes various events, including ‚ÄúM√©dievales‚Äù, a two day festival including period costumes. The earliest known lord of Commequiers (spelled Quemeiquiers at the time) is Urvoidus. In 1093, he participated in the foundation of the priory of Saint-Nicolas at Chaize-le-Vicomte by Aimery IV de Thouars. Urvoidus was almost certainly a vassal of the Thouars, and in 1099 was named Baron of Commequiers. His barony consisted of the parishes of Soullans, Saint-Christophe-du-Ligneron, Mach√© and le Perrier. Furthermore, five chatelaines were added including La V√©rie, near Challans. Through an arranged marriage, the barony of Commequiers was added to the Lordship of Montaigue at the end of the 12th century. At the beginning of the 14th century, the new baron of Commequiers was the lord of For√™t-sur-S√®vres, Josselin.

She has been a member of the National System of Researchers since 1985 and a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences since 2003. She was honored with the gold Ignacio Altamirano Medal by the government of Mexico and Secretariat of Education upon her 40th anniversary of teaching in 1991 and in 2013 the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) paid tribute to her life's work. Early life Beatriz Barba Ahuactzin was born in 1928 in Mexico City. Both of her parents were teachers, and from a young age Barba wanted to become a teacher. It was one of the few employment opportunities available to women in her era, as it allowed them to work for five hours, but then return home to care for their children. She earned a degree at the Escuela Nacional de Maestros (National Teacher's College), in 1949, with a thesis which addressed the spinal deformities of students caused by inadequate structure of the furniture they used. Wanting to further her knowledge of history and prepare as a secondary teacher she enrolled at the Escuela Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia (ENAH) in 1950 and while in school met the archaeologist Rom√°n Pi√±a Ch√°n, who she would later marry and with whom she would have three daughters. Career Barba began her career teaching primary school in 1950, at the primary school, M-255 \\"Emiliano Zapata\\" while she worked her thesis, Tlapacoya: un sitio precl√°sico de transici√≥n (Tlapacoya: a pre-classic transitional site). Though she experienced some discrimination when doing field work, with workers not wanting to take orders from a woman, her husband was supportive. Since Mexican women did not gain the right to vote until 1953, Barba understood that she was engaging in a mostly masculine field. In 1955, she graduated cum laude with a master's degree in anthropology and became the \\"first Mexican woman to obtain the title of archaeologist\\". Her thesis examined the social development and religious practices of the Tlatilco culture at the Tlapacoya archaeological site. Between 1957 and 1960, she taught history at Albert Einstein Secondary School N¬∞ 9, while continuing her studies and earning a degree as an ethnologist from ENAH in 1960. She also worked as an adjunct professor at ENAH beginning in 1958 and conducted research in conjunction with her husband at sites in Tlatilco and in Valle de Guadalupe, Northern Jalisco. In 1965, Barba founded the National Museum of Cultures in the building which had previously served as a mint, and then as the Anthropological Museum. When a new building was created in 1964 for the National Museum of Anthropology, the site was left vacant. Barba and professor, Julio C√©sar Oliv√©, pressed for the conversion of the building into a museum featuring world cultures. She served as the deputy director of the museum from 1965 to 1976 and served as a guest lecturer in anthropology at the University of Guadalajara between 1972 and 1979 and from 1980, was a permanent lecturer for ENAH. In 1982, Barba earned a master's degree in anthropological science from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and her PhD two years later. Her doctoral thesis, Ambiente social y mentalidad m√°gica en M√©xico, las bases del pensamiento m√°gico en el M√©xico precortesiano (Social environment and mentality of magic in Mexico, the bases of magical thinking in pre-Cortesian Mexico) explored the Mexican concept of magic before Cort√©s‚Ä≤ conquest. Rather than the demonic worship, depicted by Spaniards in their chronicles of Mexican culture, Barba's anthropological approach found that civilizations in ancient Mesoamerica had a reverence for the sacred, a devotion to creating books to pass on their knowledge, and an appreciation of the expanse of space. In 1984, her husband fell during an excavation at the Bec√°n archaeological site and became paralyzed. Though initially distraught, encouragement by Barba and colleagues, encouraged Pi√±a to return to his work writing fundamental texts on Mexican archaeology until his 2001 death. Barba was appointed as a National Researcher Level II by the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 1985 and in 1991 was the recipient of the Ignacio Altamirano Medal, presented by (SEP) and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. From 1995, she led the Permanent Seminar on Iconography for the National Institute of Anthropology and History. In 2002, she became the founding president of the Mexican Academy of Anthropological Sciences. In 2013, INAH paid homage to her career as a pioneering archaeologist and anthropologist upon her retirement. Barba, who was still teaching privately from her home was engaged in the compilation of her husband's archives for the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Campeche.

Hereby, the problem of finding the shortest path between every pair of nodes is known as all-pair-shortest-paths (APSP) problem. As sequential algorithms for this problem often yield long runtimes, parallelization has shown to be beneficial in this field. In this article two efficient algorithms solving this problem are introduced. Another variation of the problem is the single- source-shortest-paths (SSSP) problem, which also has parallel approaches: Parallel single-source shortest path algorithm.  Problem definition Let G=(V,E,w) be a directed Graph with the set of nodes V and the set of edges E\\\\subseteq V\\\\times V. Each edge e \\\\in E has a weight w(e) assigned. The goal of the all-pair-shortest-paths problem is to find the shortest path between all pairs of nodes of the graph. For this path to be unique it is required that the graph does not contain cycles with a negative weight. In the remainder of the article it is assumed that the graph is represented using an adjacency matrix. We expect the output of the algorithm to be a distancematrix D. In D, every entry d-{i,j} is the weight of the shortest path in G from node i to node j. The Floyd algorithm presented later can handle negative edge weights, whereas the Dijkstra algorithm requires all edges to have a positive weight.  Dijkstra algorithm  The Dijkstra algorithm originally was proposed as a solver for the single-source-shortest-paths problem. However, the algorithm can easily be used for solving the All-Pair-Shortest-Paths problem by executing the Single-Source variant with each node in the role of the root node. In pseudocode such an implementation could look as follows: 1 func DijkstraSSSP(G,v) { 2 ... //standard SSSP-implementation here 3 return dv; 4 } 5 6 func DijkstraAPSP(G) { 7 D := VxV-Matrix 8 for i from 1 to V { 9 //D[v] denotes the v-th row of D 10 D[v] := DijkstraSSP(G,i) 11 } 12 } In this example we assume that \`DisjktraSSSP\` takes the graph G and the root node v as input. The result of the execution in turn is the distancelist d_v. In d_v, the i-th element stores the distance from the root node v to the node i. Therefore the list d_v corresponds exactly to the v-th row of the APSP distancematrix D. For this reason, \`DijkstraAPSP\` iterates over all nodes of the graph G and executes \`DisjktraSSSP\` with each as root node while storing the results in D. The runtime of \`DijkstraSSSP\` is O(V^2) as we expect the graph to be represented using an adjacency matrix. Therefore \`DijkstraAPSP\` has a total sequential runtime of O(V^3). =Parallelization for up to V processors= A trivial parallelization can be obtained by parallelizing the loop of \`DijkstraAPSP\` in line8. However, when using the sequential \`DijkstraSSSP\` this limits the number of processors to be used by the number of iterations executed in the loop. Therefore, for this trivial parallelization V is an upper bound for the number of processors. For example, let the number of processors p be equal to the number of nodes V. This results in each processor executing \`DijkstraSSSP\` exactly once in parallel. However, when there are only for example p=\\\\frac{V}{2} processors available, each processor has to execute \`DijkstraSSSP\` twice. In total this yields a runtime of O(V^2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{V}{p}), when V is a multiple of p. Consequently, the efficiency of this parallelization is perfect: Employing p processors reduces the runtime by the factor p. Another benefit of this parallelization is that no communication between the processors is required. However, it is required that every processor has enough local memory to store the entire adjacency matrix of the graph. =Parallelization for more than V processors= thumbthumb If more than V processors shall be used for the parallelization, it is required that multiple processors take part of the \`DijkstraSSSP\` computation. For this reason, the parallelization is split across into two levels. For the first level the processors are split into V partitions. Each partition is responsible for the computation of a single row of the distancematrix D. This means each partition has to evaluate one \`DijkstraSSSP\` execution with a fixed root node. With this definition each partition has a size of k=\\\\frac{p}{V} processors. The partitions can perform their computations in parallel as the results of each are independent of each other. Therefore, the parallelization presented in the previous section corresponds to a partition size of 1 with p=V processors. The main difficulty is the parallelization of multiple processors executing \`DijkstraSSSP\` for a single root node. The idea for this parallelization is to distribute the management of the distancelist d_v in DijkstraSSSP within the partition. Each processor in the partition therefore is exclusively responsible for \\\\frac{V}{k} elements of d_v. For example, consider V=4 and p=8: this yields a partition size of k=2. In this case, the first processor of each partition is responsible for d_{v,1}, d_{v,2} and the second processor is responsible for d_{v,3} and d_{v,4}. Hereby, the total distance lists is d_v = [d_{v,1},d_{v,2},d_{v,3},d_{v,4}]. The \`DijkstraSSSP\` algorithm mainly consists of the repetition of two steps: First, the nearest node x in the distancelist d_v has to be found. For this node the shortest path already has been found. Afterwards the distance of all neighbors of x has to be adjusted in d_v. These steps have to be altered as follows because for the parallelization d_v has been distributed across the partition: # Find the node x with the shortest distance in d_v. #* Each processor owns a part of d_v: Each processor scans for the local minimum \\\\tilde{x} in his part, for example using linear search. #* Compute the global minimum x in d_v by performing a reduce-operation across all \\\\tilde{x}. #* Broadcast the global minimum x to all nodes in the partition. # Adjust the distance of all neighbors of x in d_v #* Every processors now knows the global nearest node x and its distance. Based on this information, adjust the neighbors of x in d_v which are managed by the corresponding processor. The total runtime of such an iteration of \`DijkstraSSSP\` performed by a partition of size k can be derived based on the performed subtasks: * The linear search for \\\\tilde{x}: O(\\\\frac{V}{k}) * Broadcast- and Reduce-operations: These can be implemented efficiently for example using binonmialtrees. This yields a communication overhead of O(\\\\log k). For V-iterations this results in a total runtime of O(V (\\\\frac{V}{k} + \\\\log k)). After substituting the definition of k this yields the total runtime for \`DijkstraAPSP\`: O(\\\\frac{V^3}{p} + \\\\log p). The main benefit of this parallelization is that it is not required anymore that every processor stores the entire adjacency matrix. Instead, it is sufficient when each processor within a partition only stores the columns of the adjacency matrix of the nodes for which he is responsible. Given a partition size of k, each processor only has to store \\\\frac{V}{k} columns of the adjacency matrix. A downside, however, is that this parallelization comes with a communication overhead due to the reduce- and broadcast-operations. Example The graph used in this example is the one presented in the image with four nodes. The goal is to compute the distancematrix with p=8 processors. For this reason, the processors are divided into four partitions with two processors each. For the illustration we focus on the partition which is responsible for the computation of the shortest paths from node A to all other nodes. Let the processors of this partition be named p1 and p2. The computation of the distancelist across the different iterations is visualized in the second image. The top row in the image corresponds to d_A after the initialization, the bottom one to d_A after the termination of the algorithm. The nodes are distributed in a way that p1 is responsible for the nodes A and B, while p2 is responsible for C and D. The distancelist d_A is distributed according to this. For the second iteration the subtasks executed are shown explicitly in the image: # Computation of the local minimum node in d_A # Computation of the globalminimum node in d_A through a reduce operation # Broadcast of the global minimum node in d_A # Marking of the global nearest node as \\"finished\\" and adjusting the distance of its neighbors  Floyd algorithm  The Floyd algorithm solves the All-Pair-Shortest-Paths problem for directed graphs. With the adjacency matrix of a graph as input, it calculates shorter paths iterative. After V iterations the distance-matrix contains all the shortest paths. The following describes a sequential version of the algorithm in pseudo code: 1 func Floyd_All_Pairs_SP(A) { 2 D^{(0)} = A; 3 for k := 1 to n do 4 for i := 1 to n do 5 for j := 1 to n do 6 d^{(k)}_{i,j} := \\\\min(d^{(k-1)}_{i,j}, d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} + d^{(k-1)}_{k,j}) 7 } partition of a matrix with 2-D block mapping Where A is the adjacency matrix, n = V the number of nodes and D the distance matrix. For a more detailed description of the sequential algorithm look up Floyd‚ÄìWarshall algorithm. =Parallelization= The basic idea to parallelize the algorithm is to partition the matrix and split the computation between the processes. Each process is assigned to a specific part of the matrix. A common way to achieve this is 2-D Block Mapping. Here the matrix is partitioned into squares of the same size and each square gets assigned to a process. For an n \\\\times n-matrix and p processes each process calculates a n/ \\\\sqrt p \\\\times n/ \\\\sqrt p sized part of the distance matrix. For p = n^2 processes each would get assigned to exactly one element of the matrix. Because of that the parallelization only scales to a maximum of n^2 processes. In the following we refer with p_{i,j} to the process that is assigned to the square in the i-th row and the j-th column. As the calculation of the parts of the distance matrix is dependent on results from other parts the processes have to communicate between each other and exchange data. In the following we refer with d^{(k)}_{i,j} to the element of the i-th row and j-th column of the distance matrix after the k-th iteration. To calculate d^{(k)}_{i,j} we need the elements d^{(k-1)}_{i,j}, d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} and d^{(k-1)}_{k,j} as specified in line 6 of the algorithm. d^{(k-1)}_{i,j} is available to each process as it was calculated by itself in the previous iteration. Additionally each process needs a part of the k-th row and the k-th column of the D^{k-1} matrix. The d^{(k-1)}_{i,k} element holds a process in the same row and the d^{(k-1)}_{k,j} element holds a process in the same column as the process that wants to compute d^{(k)}_{i,j}. Each process that calculated a part of the k-th row in the D^{k-1} matrix has to send this part to all processes in its column. Each process that calculated a part of the k-th column in the D^{k-1} matrix has to send this part to all processes in its row. All this processes have to do a one-to-all-broadcast operation along the row or the column. The data dependencies are illustrated in the image below. For the 2-D block mapping we have to modify the algorithm as follows: 1 func Floyd_All_Pairs_Parallel(D^{(0)}) { 2 for k := 1 to n do{ 3 Each process p_{i,j} that has a segment of the k-th row of D^{(k-1)}, broadcasts it to the p_{*,j} processes; 4 Each process p_{i,j} that has a segment of the k-th column of D^{(k-1)}, broadcasts it to the p_{i,*} processes; 5 Each process waits to receive the needed segments; 6 Each process computes its part of the D^{(k)} matrix; 7 } 8 } data dependencies in Floyd algorithm In line 5 of the algorithm we have a synchronisation step to ensure that all processes have the data necessary to compute the next iteration. To improve the runtime of the algorithm we can remove the synchronisation step without affecting the correctness of the algorithm. To achieve that each process starts the computation as soon as it has the data necessary to compute its part of the matrix. This version of the algorithm is called pipelined 2-D block mapping. =Runtime= The runtime of the sequential algorithm is determined by the triple nested for loop. The computation in line 6 can be done in constant time (O(1)). Therefore, the runtime of the sequential algorithm is O(n^3). 2-D block mapping The runtime of the parallelized algorithm consists of two parts. The time for the computation and the part for communication and data transfer between the processes. As there is no additional computation in the algorithm and the computation is split equally among the p processes, we have a runtime of O(n^3 / p) for the computational part. In each iteration of the algorithm there is a one-to-all broadcast operation performed along the row and column of the processes. There are n / \\\\sqrt p elements broadcast. Afterwards there is a synchronisation step performed. How much time these operations take is highly dependent on the architecture of the parallel system used. Therefore, the time needed for communication and data transfer in the algorithm is T_\\\\text{comm} = n (T_\\\\text{synch} + T_\\\\text{broadcast}). For the whole algorithm we have the following runtime: : T = O\\\\left( \\\\frac{n^3} p\\\\right) + n (T_\\\\text{synch} + T_\\\\text{broadcast}) Pipelined 2-D block mapping For the runtime of the data transfer between the processes in the pipelined version of the algorithm we assume that a process can transfer k elements to a neighbouring process in O(k) time. In every step there are n / \\\\sqrt p elements of a row or a column send to a neighbouring process. Such a step takes O(n / \\\\sqrt p ) time. After \\\\sqrt p steps the relevant data of the first row and column arrive at process p_{\\\\sqrt p ,\\\\sqrt p} (in O(n) time). The values of successive rows and columns follow after time O(n^2 / p) in a pipelined mode. Process p_{\\\\sqrt p ,\\\\sqrt p} finishes its last computation after O(n^3 / p) + O(n) time. Therefore, the additional time needed for communication in the pipelined version is O(n). The overall runtime for the pipelined version of the algorithm is: : T = O\\\\left( \\\\frac{n^3} p\\\\right) + O(n)  References  Bibliography * Grama, A.: Introduction to parallel computing.

As Pang Tong was famous in Wu Commandery, many people came to see him when he was about to leave. During this time, he met and befriended Lu Ji, Gu Shao and Quan Cong, and appraised each of them in turn. Pang Tong described Lu Ji as \\"a horse that cannot run fast but has strong willpower\\", and Gu Shao as \\"an ox that is physically weak but capable of bearing burdens over great distances\\". Someone then asked Pang Tong: \\"Does that mean Lu Ji is better than Gu Shao?\\" Pang Tong replied: \\"Although a horse can run fast, it can only bear the weight of one person. An ox can travel 300 li a day; it can certainly bear more than just the weight of one person!\\" Gu Shao later asked Pang Tong: \\"You are also known for being a good judge of character. Between us, who do you think is the better one?\\" Pang Tong replied: \\"I am not as good as you in associating with people and assessing their characters.

He became a journalist, based in Letchworth, where he developed an interest in town planning and the garden city movement. In 1906, he was appointed as secretary of the Garden City Association, and in 1907 he founded the International Garden Cities and Town Planning Association. Enthusiastic about the positions, in his spare time he qualified as a town planner and as an architect. Through the association, he promoted low-density housing schemes, whether designed as new towns or as extensions to existing ones, and in 1913 he toured the United States speaking on this topic. His approach was opposed by Ebenezer Howard, founder of the movement, and in 1918 he was replaced by Charles Purdom, who, like Howard, championed only new town developments. After World War I, Culpin was president of the Belgian Society for the Reconstruction of Belgium, and he chaired the Standing Conference on London Regional Planning from 1926 until his death. In 1930, he was the president of the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors, while in 1937/8 he was president of the Town Planning Institute. He also became a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects.

Background Route map of the future network. Nearly all lines of the Munich S-Bahn use the core route through the city centre in the underground, creating a bottle-neck responsible for long and increasingly frequent delays from even the smallest disruptions. The disadvantage of current core route is the inability of trains to reroute themselves onto different tracks in an event of disruption. After years of discussions and studies into different route propositions, a second tunnel through the city centre has been already approved with the funding of ‚Ç¨3.85 billion and the completion date of 2026. On 5 April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony took place to commence the construction. The second tunnel will be in length and run in parallel with the current tunnel in the south on the western portion of Hauptbahnhof and in the north on the eastern portion. It will have three underground stations (Hauptbahnhof, Marienhof, Ostbahnhof) and two surface stations (Laim and Leuchtenbergring). Only Marienhof station is the all-new station in the north of Marienplatz U-Bahn and S-Bahn station while other stations will be expanded to accommodate the new tunnel. With focus on express service and shorter travel time, the second tunnel will bypass six current stations between Laim and Ostbahnhof. Most of express S-Bahn with limited stops will use the second tunnel: the proposed express S-Bahn routes are S18X (Herrsching-Leuchtenbergring), S21X (Landshut-Leuchtenbergring), S23X (Mering-Flughafen M√ºnchen), and S24X (Buchloe-Leuchtenbergring).

Sargis, son of Varam, belonged to the Tmogveli branch of the powerful Mkhargrdzeli family and owned estates in Tmogvi. Tmogveli rendered the old Iranian love story Vƒ´s and RƒÅmƒ´n (written by Fakhruddin As'ad Gurgani) into Georgian prose; this Georgian version of the Persian original became known as Visramiani.  Biography  During a revolt of Queen Tamar's disgraced husband, George the Rus', around 1191, Sargis was one of the few nobles who remained loyal to the queen. For this he was kindly rewarded; he was given Tmogvi to secure frontier borders in Javakheti. In 1195 he participated in the Battle of Shamkor. In the 1200s, Shalva and Sargis Tmogveli, commanded the Georgian troops during the victorious campaign against Kars. In 1203 he fought in a campaign in the country of Dvin.

B. Ships, sea songs and shanties Brown, James & Son Glasgow 1910 reprinted 1913, 1927, 1948 and 1986 He joined the Merchant Navy as a boy of 14 and learned the songs during 11 years aboard East Indiamen. In the foreword to his book he wrote that he thought the songs \\"worthy of preservation\\". In addition Whall wrote a number of books about navigation and practical seamanship.  Early years  William Boultbee Whall was baptised on 31 January 1847 by his own father Revd William Whall, rector of St James the Great church in the hamlet of Thurning on the border between Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire. His father, born in Lincoln in 1807, went to Emmanuel College Cambridge and remained as rector of Thurning for over 40 years (1833 till his death in 1874). His mother Mary Elizabeth Boultbee was born in Oxford in 1817, daughter of Revd Richard Moore Boultbee. William Jr was the eldest of 8 children and was initially \\"intended for the church, not for the sea\\". As a young boy, he was a chorister (1854‚Äì61) at Magdalen College Oxford where he happened to receive musical tuition from a young John Stainer. In 1860 Stainer was attached to the choir school as an organist and choirmaster at age 20. Perhaps because his voice broke, Whall left the choir school in 1861 to go to sea.  Maritime years  Although the Royal Navy was revamping its training system at this time following the Pelham Commission of 1856,Dickinson, Harry Educating the Royal Navy p65 Routledge 2012 Whall preferred the Merchant Navy as a career choice and quickly achieved his Second mate certificate in 1867 in London and his First mate certificate in 1869. He became a Master mariner in 1878 and by 1901 was a nautical surveyor with the Board of Trade based at Wallasey on the River Mersey.1901 census Liscard, Cheshire RG13/piece 3402 folio 60 p5 By the 1911 census Whall, aged 64, was a Principal Officer at the Board of Trade in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales, supervising sea vessels in the Bristol Channel.  Sea Shanty book  Nearing retirement, Whall recalled the sea songs of his youth, combining them perhaps with songs from sailors he had met in the Liverpool and Bristol areas in his latter years. At first he published a selection of songs in the Nautical Magazine and in Yachting Monthly but then resolved to compile them all in a single book, writing: \\"I set myself a plain task, namely to write down these songs, music and words, as I heard them sung at sea by sailors.\\" He enrolled the help of his younger brother Roughton Henry Whall (1862‚Äì1933), an organist and music teacher (Mus. Bac., FRCO) living in Stroud, Glos as well as his niece Veronica Whall (b1885), the young daughter of another brother Christopher Whall, a stained glass artist in Dorking. Roughton Whall supplied the musical settings and Veronica Whall the illustrations for the book, which came out in 1910 and quickly went through several editions. It contained 50 songs, half of which would find their way into most modern shanty books or repertoires.Whall, W. B. \\"Contents\\".

Songs of Sea Labour Swan & Co 1914. accessed 31 March 2018 Whall also preceded the folksong collector Cecil Sharp, who picked up shanties from Somerset singers Henry Rapsey and Henry Bailey in Bridgwater as well as a massive store of songs from John Short ('Yankee Jack') at Watchet.

Education  Crane received a Bachelors of Arts in Geology, with a minor in German, from Oregon State University in 1973. In 1977, she received a doctorate from Scripps Institution of Oceanography with a dissertation entitled \\"Hydrothermal Activity and Near Axis Structure at Mid-Ocean Spreading Centers\\". From 1977-1979, she studied mid-ocean ridges as a postdoctoral fellow with Robert (Bob) Ballard at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  Discovery of hydrothermal vents  In June 1976, on the Pleiades II expedition on the R/V Melville to the Gal√°pagos Rift, Crane detected a 0.1 ¬∞C anomaly using a temperature-monitoring system she had developed for the Deep-Tow seafloor imaging system run by Fred Noel Spiess of the Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The temperature anomaly, as well as seafloor images of volcanic features, provided strong support for the hypothesis that hydrothermal vents existed on the seafloor. Crane nick-named the sites ‚ÄúClambake I\\" and \\"Clambake II\\", after the abundance of clamshells in the area, and deployed transponders near the vents. She published the maps and temperature anomaly in the Journal of Geophysical Research in November 1977, and on the structure and tectonics in the Journal of Geology in November 1978, and in the Journal of Geophysical Research in October 1979. In February 1977, Crane's map and transponders enabled a team of geochemists and geophysicists, led by chief scientists John (Jack) Corliss, from Oregon State University, Richard (Dick) Von Herzen from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Robert (Bob) Ballard from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, to return to the Clambake site with the deep-ocean research submersible, DSV Alvin on the R/V Knorr. Close-up photography and biological sampling of Clambake I and II led to the discovery of the biological process of chemosynthesis in clams, mussels, and tube worms, and was key evidence in support of the nascent theory of plate tectonics. In the 1980s, Crane was involved in mapping hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge and additional vent fields along the East Pacific Rise. She also published geophysical models of along-axis spacing of sea-floor volcanism. In 1990, Crane was part of an expedition of American, Soviet and Canadian scientists, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and the Soviet Academy of Sciences, that discovered hydrothermal vents on the bottom of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, which revealed that the lake lies in a continental rift zone.  Scientific career  From 1979-2001, Crane was a Research Associate at Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory, where she studied the formation of mid-ocean ridges. In 1985, she was awarded a Fulbright Award at University of Oslo and University of Paris. From 1985 to 2001, she was a professor of oceanography at Hunter College of the City University of New York. From 1993-2001, she managed the Arctic Environmental Security program at the United States Naval Research Laboratory, served as U.S. mission coordinator for the Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic program, and authored the Arctic Environmental Atlas. From 2001 to 2015, she was a Program Manager in the Arctic Research Program of the Climate Program Office of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Crane has published 83 peer-reviewed articles and is the author of the 2003 autobiography, Sea Legs: Tales of a Woman Oceanographer, which received acclaim as a personal memoir as well as for its first-hand reports of \\"ocean science, Cold War science, and women's participation in science\\".

History AntiDayton started as a grassroots activist organisation among local and diaspora Bosnians (especially Bosniaks), with its base on the worldwide social media platform Facebook. It was organized around the concept that the Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War and provided the current structure and constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was a total failure and an illegal abrogation of the Constitution of the wartime Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Returning to the previous constitution would have abolished the entities of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brƒçko District and Republika Srpska, from which the group sees as only promoting internal divisions and ethnic tensions. The group's first public gathering was in the Sarajevo, under the slogan \\"Let's bury Dayton, under the ground and concrete!\\" Activism Since 2012, AntiDayton has organized commemorations of historic events (placing the flag of the medieval kingdom of Bosnia in Bobovac), patriotic group field trips (seeing Bosnian Queen Catherine of Bosnia, raising funds for humanitarian causes, visiting the forgotten war patriots, distributing presents for (returning refugees) kids in need, being there during times of natural disasters (2014 Bosnia-Herzegovina floods), fundraising for construction of victim memorials (Nermin Divoviƒá - Sarajevo), advocacy for the return of the land grab and case of Sutorina dispute, commemorating genocide burials throughout Bosnia (Flag draping over victims coffins in Srebrenica), advocating solutions through multimedia show appearances (TV A1, Alpha TV, N1 TV, BHTVNY, BosTel, Radio Na≈°a Rijeƒç), standing up for wrongfully charged and innocent Bosnian leaders (e.g. Jovan Divjak, Naser Oriƒá, Atif Dudakoviƒá, Dragan Vikiƒá, Jusuf Pu≈°ina...), protesting civil injustice (closing of the National Museum, genocide denial, Russia involvement in Bosnian war crimes), and appearing at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentencing of Bosnian Serb and Croat war criminals and standing with Bosniak victims in support. Views AntiDayton sees the origins of Bosnian people being defined by having Illyrian ancestors, the Bosnian Church, and Bogomils. It believes that the Bosnian public education could have one unified curriculum only taught in the Bosnian language. AntiDayton also supports the criminalization of genocide denial and the jailing (or even sentencing to death) of war criminals. Politics AntiDayton is not affiliated with any political party, but is supportive of first Bosnian president Alija Izetbegoviƒá. AntiDayton supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the European Union, the abrogation of the Dayton Accords in favor of Bosnia's 1992 constitution, and the complete removal of ethnic quotas.

It was the first organization to target for membership, middle-class women of colour and focus on the needs of working class women, regardless of their marital status and was the leading women's organization in the country from its establishment through the 1940s. Though it has branches throughout the country, its headquarters is located at 3 Longden Street in Port of Spain. History In 1921, Audrey Jeffers, an educated, middle-class Afro- Trinidiadian teacher recognized that the needs of her students were far greater than education. She founded the Coterie of Social Workers in Port of Spain to help with their health and welfare needs. Prior to forming the organisation, assistance to the disadvantaged was provided solely by upper- class white and coloured women and focused mainly toward assisting women to become better wives. Jeffers believed the focus of assistance should be on working class women and their children, regardless of their marital status, and she recruited like minded women to engage in the work of the Coterie. The organisation was headquartered in Briarsend, at the end of Briar Street in the Saint Clair district, and held fundraising events to raise money for improvement projects. In 1926, they opened a school lunch program in Newtown, which provided free meals and became known as the \\"Breakfast Shed\\". Quickly the need for providing nutritious meals spread and other sheds were established. By 1934, there were locations in Barataria, on Edward Street in the center of Port of Spain, in San Fernando, Siparia and on Tobago. The Coterie continued expanding services to assist the less advantaged and raise the status of middle class women of colour, but focused primarily on black women. One of the few exceptions was Afro- and Indo-Trinidadian, social worker and Coterie member, Gema Ramkeesoon, who campaigned for cooperation among various ethnic groups, as well as against shadism. In addition to providing homes for the blind and elderly, the Coterie pressed for higher education for girls and employment opportunities for middle class women. They sought reform of laws to address illegitimacy and alimony, and pressed to change laws which barred women from participating in governmental boards and councils, or serving as jurors. The Coterie would be the leading women's rights organization for middle-class women in Trinidad and Tobago from the 1920s to the 1940s. In 1936, the Coterie hosted a conference in Port of Spain and invited social workers from throughout the British West Indies and British Guiana. Marking the 15th anniversary of the Coterie, the conference held from 30 April to 10 May, aimed to promote regional cooperation between women involved in social welfare projects to improve educational, social and political spheres for women. The same year that this conference occurred, the government was taking steps to limit women's roles, passing legislation in Trinidad to ban married women as teachers. A few years later, they barred women from working at night, in an attempt to curtail them from being away from their primary duty of caring for their children. At the conference, women such as Jeffers, Beatrice Greig, Jessie Masson, and Gertie Wood spoke about women's intellectual capacity, their subordination and suppression, and the need for women to become educated and press for their right to be included in social and political structures. The conference was notable in that it did not allow men to speak throughout the majority of the sessions and that Jeffers emphasized that the government was failing in its obligation to address the needs of citizens. At the conclusion of the conference the public opinion was mixed, with some sectors understanding the problem of unequal policies for men and women, while others blamed women for their lack of action to improve their situation. The conference, however, marked a turning point. Following the conference, Jeffers ran for a seat on the Port of Spain City Council and won the first seat ever awarded to a woman in the country. The following year in Jamaica, Amy Bailey and Mary Morris Knibb formed the Women's Liberal Club, along the lines of the Coterie, which focused on improving socio-economic and political status for middle class women of colour. In 1938, the Coterie submitted a response to the West India Royal Commission enquiry calling for reform of education systems which did not allow girls to compete for Island Scholarships, did not provide vocational training, had no adult education programs to train women, and did not provide nursery schools, among other issues. They also pointed out the need for measures to prevent employment discrimination on the basis of color and gender, to facilitate forming of trade unions to protect women and girls, the need for women police officers to deal with women offenders and reform of child support laws. In 1940, the Coterie opened its first day nursery, called Cipriani House, in Laventille and In the 1940s and 1950s, working with the Child Welfare League, the Day Nursery Association, the League of Women Voters and the Union of Women Citizens, the Coterie instigated the establishment of National Health Centers. Attending government meetings, Parliament sessions and lectures from health professionals, the women pressed to have health services available throughout Trinidad and Tobago. Present The organisational headquarters is now located at 3 Longden Street in Port of Spain and celebrated its 85th year of operation in 2007 at which time, complaints surfaced that the house at 22 Sweet Briar Road, the original site of the Coterie, was in disrepair. It was restored and is now a Cultural Heritage Site. The organization continues to provide food through its meal centers, located throughout the island.

The first in a series called The Murderbot Diaries, it was published by Tor.com. The series is about an artificial construct designed as a Security Unit, which manages to override its governor unit, thus enabling it to develop independence. It calls itself Murderbot, and likes to watch unrealistic space operas. As it spends more time with some caring humans, it starts developing feelings that it does not care for. Synopsis A scientific expedition on an alien planet goes awry when one of its members is attacked by a giant native creature. She is saved by the expedition's SecUnit, a cyborg security agent which has secretly named itself \\"Murderbot\\". Though it has hacked the governor module that allows it to be controlled by humans, and would much rather be watching soap operas, the SecUnit has a vested interest in keeping its human clients safe and alive, since it has an especially grisly past expedition on its record. Murderbot soon discovers that information regarding hazardous fauna has been deleted from their survey packet of the planet. Further investigation reveals that some sections of their maps are missing as well. Meanwhile the PreservationAux survey team, led by Dr. Mensah, navigate their mixed feelings about the part machine, part human nature of their SecUnit. When they lose contact with the other known expedition, the DeltFall Group, Mensah leads a team to the opposite side of the planet to investigate. At the DeltFall habitat, Murderbot discovers that everyone there has been brutally murdered, and one of their three SecUnits destroyed. Murderbot disables the remaining two as they attack it, but is surprised when two others appear; it destroys one, and Mensah takes the other. Murderbot is seriously injured, and realizes that one of the rogue SecUnits has installed a combat override module into its neck. The Preservation scientists are able to remove it before it completes the data upload that would put Murderbot under the control of whoever has command over the other SecUnits. The team discovers that Murderbot is autonomous, and once malfunctioned and murdered 57 people. The Preservation scientists mostly agree that, based on its protective behavior thus far, the SecUnit can be trusted. Remembering small incidents that now appear to be attempted sabotage, Murderbot and the group determine that there must be a third expedition, whose members are trying to eliminate DeltFall and Preservation for some reason. The Preservation scientists confirm that their HubSystem has been hacked, and flee their habitat before the mystery expedition they have dubbed \\"EvilSurvey\\" comes to kill them. The EvilSurvey team‚ÄîGrayCris‚Äîleaves a message in the Preservation habitat inviting its scientists to meet at a rendezvous point to negotiate terms for their survival. Murderbot knows that GrayCris will never let them live, but the SecUnit has a plan. It makes an overture to GrayCris to negotiate for its own freedom, but this is a distraction while the Preservation scientists access the GrayCris HubSystem to activate their emergency beacon. The plan works, but Murderbot is injured protecting Mensah from the explosion of the launch. Later the SecUnit finds itself repaired, and retaining its memories and disabled governor module. Mensah has bought its contract, and will bring it back to Preservation's home base where it can live autonomously. Though grateful, Murderbot is reluctant to have its decisions made for it, and slips away on a cargo ship. Reception Publishers Weekly wrote that Wells \\"gives depth to a rousing but basically familiar action plot by turning it into the vehicle by which SecUnit engages with its own rigorously denied humanity\\". The Verge likewise felt it to be a \\"pretty basic story\\", but nonetheless \\"fun\\", and lauded Wells's worldbuilding. James Nicoll observed that the plot relies on \\"opportunistic corporate malevolence\\", and noted that only Murderbot's personality prevented the setting from being \\"unrelentingly grim\\".

She presented her work to Queen Victoria and received royal patronage for life. She is also the first professional woman artist in Nova Scotia, recognized in her field during her active career years. She worked with scientists and government officials, garnering her accolades as the \\"Audubon of Nova Scotian field flowers\\".http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/viewFile/4155/3399  Career  Born into a middle class family, Miller's mother Sybilla encouraged her to learn about art. Miller studied her craft in Halifax under the tutelage of a visiting British painter named L'Estrange. She also studied with W.H. Jones, a Bostonian who taught at Dalhousie College. In 1830, she began offering drawing classes to female students which gave her some financial independence. The North British Society of Halifax honoured her with the title of \\"Painter of the Year\\" in 1836. Soon after, Nova Scotia's Secretary of Agriculture and botanist, Titus Smith, asked Miller to paint a series of canvasses depicting local wildflowers. He brought her specimens which she quickly had to immortalize, before the plants deteriorated. During the mid 1830s, aided by Smith's scientific input, Miller produced a large number of water colour drawings which later ended up in an important Halifax art exhibition in 1848. Smith provided botanical descriptions for Miller's first catalog of coloured lithographs entitled Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia. It was issued in 1840 by a London bookseller and local publisher, with the financial support of the province's lieutenant-governor Sir Colin Campbell. Two other sets of lithographs followed in 1853 and 1866. The second publication was also issued as Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia. The third catalog was entitled Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and was annotated by George Lawson, a botanist who founded the Botanical Society of Canada. In 1867, the first series was reissued with a new title, Wild Flowers of British North America. With her four catalogs, Miller was able to document 22 native plants, at a time when there was an increasing interest in natural history. In 1862, Miller participated in an International Exhibition in London, England. Although her drawings arrived too late to be part of the competition, she received positive reviews in the English press. In 1867, a copy of her botanical paintings were exhibited at the Paris Exposition. Miller's works are part of the permanent collection at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canada's largest art museum. Other paintings and lithographs are owned by The Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, also located in Halifax. Ottawa's National Gallery of Canada has some of her lithographs as well, belonging to the 1840 and 1853 series. Also a writer, Miller published a volume of poetry, Metrical Musings, with her sister Catherine in 1856.  Personal life  Most records indicate that Maria Morris Miller was born in 1813 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of Captain Guy Morris and Sibylla Amelia Maria Sophia Leggett. Her father, who was a descendant of Charles Morris, died when Maria was a small child. (She may have also been born in 1810 in Country Harbour, Nova Scotia with her mother moving the family to Halifax after her father's death in 1813.) In 1840, Maria Morris Miller married Garret Trafalgar Nelson Miller, the son of Garrett Miller and Catherine Pernette, who was the daughter of Joseph Pernette. Maria Morris Miller and her husband had five children. She passed away in Halifax in 1875.  Gallery  File:Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia Epigoea repens.

Le Neve was sent to Hart Hall at Oxford in 1679-80, and later in life became a local magistrate and captain of the local militia. Marriage and Witchingham Hall Great Witchingham Hall In 1684 Le Neve married Anne Gawdy (1656 - 1696), who was from a further Norfolk gentry family at West Harling, typically of lawyers and MPs. Anne Gawdy was granddaughter to Sir William Gawdy (1612‚Äì1669), who was an MP in the Cavalier Parliament, and who had bought his baronetcy in 1663. Anne died in 1696 after producing two boys, one of whom died in 1689 in infancy, and three girls. Le Neve was a strong friend to Bassingbourne, Anne's brother, until his death of smallpox. He renovated and replanted gardens at Witchingham Hall, with plants, particularly fruit, he bought from local contacts, or in London and transported through the port of Great Yarmouth from the Thames. He shipped additional London purchases under personal request of the Gawdy family, particularly painting materials for the painter and brother of Bassingbourne, John Gawdy who succeeded to the Gawdy baronetcy as the 2nd Baronet.Goodwin, Gordon; \\"Gawdy, John\\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 21. Retrieved 31 March 2018 Le Neve became a popular and social focus for young Tory squires, the sons of Civil War cavaliers, with Witchingham Hall becoming a centre for convivial hospitality, and animosity towards the Whigs in power and the court. The pastimes he and his friends favoured were hunting with beagles, shooting, fishing, and horse racing at Newmarket. Through these he became close friends with John (Jack) Millecent, a rakish squire from Linton, Cambridgeshire, whose family also shared mutual animosity with their local Whigs. By 1894 Millecent had persuaded Le Neve to breed and keep his own beagle pack, sold to him by Millecent who later stated was \\"the finest pack of Beagles in England\\". The growing reputation of Le Neve's pack in 1697 prompted Sir Horatio Pettus Bt. to beg a hound off him, one of a number sold to members of the Norfolk gentry. In 1707, after hunting hare and fox in Norfolk, Essex and Surrey, Le Neve sold his pack, only to buy another soon after. Le Neve was a collector of ribald verse penned by his Witchingham Hall circle of friends which he edited and gathered into a folio miscellany, and which today is kept by Chetham's Library in Manchester. Some verses were by Le Neve himself, with titles such as 'Madam as victors when they quit the field', 'Tell me insipid lecher now the tide', and 'When Lydia thou the rosy neck and arms'.\\"Manchester, Chetham‚Äôs Library, MS Mum.

Election and animosity Le Neve was frequently at odds with, and slighted by, Norfolk higher gentry who tended to be Whigs and supporters of William III. A particular earlier slight was the patronizing attitude of Thomas Browne of Elsing Hall over the 22-year-old Le Neve's trade (\\"mircatorian\\") family background. This animosity came to a head during the election year of 1698. Sir Henry Hobart MP of Blickling Hall was \\"the undisputed leader of Norfolk Whigs\\",Handley, S.

The election was, however, a turning point for Hobart, a sitting MP. Three candidates contended for two positions: Sir Henry (Whig), Sir William Cooke (Tory), and Sir Jacob Astley (Whig). Hobart lost after spending a considerable sum to ensure his seat. In the heightened atmosphere surrounding the election, rumours were circulating about Hobart, particularly concerning his growing debts and creditors, and one that Le Neve was saying Hobart was a coward, especially during 1689-90 when he was Gentleman of the Horse for William III while campaigning in Ireland, and it was this poor reputation cost him the election. Le Neve denied the accusation. Hobart, who believed Le Neve was instrumental in his defeat, publicly accused him of spreading the rumour-- this in the market square at Reepham in Le Neve's absence--and that the only reason he denied it was that he was too afraid to fight. Le Neve wrote to Hobart asserting again his innocence, but offering to give satisfaction to whomever had spread the rumour, saying if Hobart could not prove the name of the culprit, he would assume it was \\"Blickling\\" (code for Hobart himself) that was generating this quarrel, and that he would meet him at his choosing. An appointment was made for the duel. Duel and aftermath Duels had been tacitly assumed illegal since a 1614 edict by James I, but often a blind eye was turned. However, prosecution for duelling was a possibility, especially if no seconds or witnesses were present to assure fair play. Adam Nicolson in his book Gentry: Six Hundred Years of a Peculiarly English Class conjectures that despite this, the reason Hobart and Le Neve refused seconds was conversely to avoid any witness for possible prosecution. Some sources suggest that a young servant girl witnessed the duel from nearby bushes;Briggs, Stacia; Connor, Siofra; \\"Weird Norfolk: The Cawston duel stone and a ghost of Blickling Hall\\", Eastern Daily Press, 20 October 2017. Retrieved 31 March 2018 reliable sources either don't mention this, or if they do, treat it as folklore. The duel took place on Cawston Heath on 20 August 1698. Both men rode from their respective seats: Hobart from Blickling to the north-east, and Le Neve from Witchingham 4 miles to the south-west. During the duel the left-handed Le Neve was apparently struck in the arm and replied with a thrust to the belly. The mortally wounded Hobart returned to Blickling Hall, died the following day and was buried in the Blickling family vault. Duel memorial at Cawston Narcissus Luttrell, parliamentary diarist, heard that Le Neve \\"was wounded in the arm and Sir Henry run into the belly\\" The antiquary John Nichols in 1812 stated that le Neve wasn't struck as Hobart's sword thrust was caught in a greatcoat Le Neve was wearing. Adam Nicolson believes these accounts say more about class attitudes towards the differences in the backgrounds of the two men: the rapier of the elegant swordsmanship of the grand gentry in its finery aiming for the arm and being tangled in the coarse cloth of the minor gentry, which replies with a stab to the belly. However Nicolson is sceptical, believing that as a captain of militia Le Neve would be more than skillful in refined use of sword, and on a possibly hot August day, would prefer not to be encumbered by a greatcoat. Le Neve decided to escape the area, concerned over repercussions of killing a Whig of such high rank. A ¬£500 reward for capture was offered by Lady Hobart. The armed Norfolk Militia was set to look for him, some searching the Gawdy house at West Harling. From London, Le Neve left for Rotterdam, although occasionally returning incognito to London, where he was once nearly captured. He kept in touch with his family and friends who offered advice to avoid capture and provided Norfolk comestibles, he sending goods back from Holland. While on his travels and in Rotterdam he adopted the aliases of 'Davyes', 'Captain Janszen', and 'Mr Browne, the sword cutler'. He received a visit from his wife Jane in 1699. In East Anglia Le Neve was a hero and martyr for Tories, while the Whigs wanted him outlawed if he didn't return to face trial. His friends tried to arrange a sheriff and jury who would be, to their mind, honest and responsible. He returned and went on trial at Thetford assizes in 1700, was found not guilty, and returned to Witchingham. After Jane died in 1704, and was buried at St Mary's Church, Jack Millecent again turned matchmaker for Le Neve. He secured a further marriage on 31 July 1707 to Elizabeth (b.1678), daughter to his friend Robert Sheffield who was the grandson to the Earl of Musgrave; she was one of two eligible Sheffield sisters presented by Millecent. Three months later Elizabeth died. Following the duel, Lady Hobart erected a memorial stone plinth with urn at the site.

As his sons predeceased him, his estate passed to his elder brother Peter until his death in 1729, who in his will intended the estate to pass to his three nieces, Le Neve's daughters. However, after legal battles, with accusations by the Le Neves of conflict interest, the estate was taken through reversion of the will by the trustees of a John Norris, whose grandfather, a Norwich lawyer of the same name, had acted as trustee for the young Oliver Le Neve.

Cherokee County Governmental Building Authority is a 2013 Supreme Court of Oklahoma case that held for the first time that the Oklahoma state constitution provided a civil remedy for violations of state constitutional rights. The recognition of civil remedies directly under the state constitution was viewed as a watershed moment in the development of civil rights in Oklahoma. Since the decision issued, claims asserting violations of state constitutional rights in Oklahoma are now colloquially referred to as \\"Bosh claims.\\" The Bosh decision resulted from an incident at a local jail. Video from the facility showed a handcuffed man, later identified as Daniel Bosh, exchanging words with a jailer. The video shows the jailer leave his chair to confront Mr. Bosh. As the two men continued exchanging words, the jailer grabbed Mr. Bosh by the back of the neck and drove his head into the front of the booking desk. The jailer then placed Mr. Bosh's head underneath his arm and fell backwards causing Mr. Bosh's head to strike the floor causing injuries. At the time of the incident, Oklahoma law provided absolute immunity for conduct occurring within a jail facility. In Bosh, the Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized that immunity conflicted with the state constitution which prohibited the use of excessive force. For this reason, the Oklahoma Supreme Court held that recognizing immunity in this circumstance would nullify rights granted by the state constitution. Since the decision issued, both state and federal courts have wrestled with the scope of the opinion and how it might apply in contexts outside excessive force within a jail. The case was argued to the Court by lawyers from the Bryan & Terrill law firm.  References  Category:Oklahoma state case law ","title":"Bosh v.

Early life and education  Menzies Campbell was born in Carfin, North Lanarkshire on 21 July 1893 to Agnes and John Shirlaw. Her mother was the older sister of Dr Marion Gilchrist and named her daughter Margaret after their mother, Margaret Gilchrist, n√©e Williamson. On her birth record, her father is listed as the manager of Carfin Farm, however, by the 1911 census, the family had moved to Darlington, County Durham. She attended University College Dundee and then University of St Andrews School of Medicine, graduating with an MB ChB in 1918. During her time at St Andrews, in 1915, she founded the Bute Medical Society, with the support of six other students and was the Society's first president.  Career  A month after her graduation, she was appointed as a house surgeon at Doncaster Royal Infirmary in August 1918. She was the first woman to hold this post at the institution. One of her cases made the newspapers, showcasing the pressure the medical profession was under at the time, when a young woman, Elizabeth Pawson, died suddenly \\"whilst under an anaesthetic, during an operation for appendicitis\\". Shirlaw had operated alone, except for a nurse - Sister Florence Milnes - who had administered the anaesthetic. During the inquest, Shirlaw explained that this situation was unusual, but was \\"owing to the shortage of doctors and the influenza epidemic\\". Shirlaw testified that she had performed \\"between 200 and 400 operations since her appointment\\" in August 1918. The Coroner felt that he could not rule on the case entirely by himself, and called for a jury to attend on 18 March 1919. They heard from Dr Reginald Wilson, a member of the honorary medical staff at the Infirmary, that performing the operation alone was \\"against the rules of the Infirmary in normal times, and against general practice\\". Dr Cleresby Wilson, another doctor, and also the hospital administrator, restated that the lack of doctors available to help Shirlaw was due to the war during his testimony. The jury ruled that Pawson's death had been due to her poor overall health. They added a rider that no blame should be attached to Shirlaw, nor any of the other hospital staff, but suggested that in future a medical practitioner be called in to administer the anaesthetic. She continued to work in Doncaster for another two years, when she returned to Glasgow and joined her aunt, Marion Gilchrist, in general practice, based at 5 Buckingham Terrace She is also listed at this time as working at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow as a surgeon. She researched and wrote histories of women's medical education and practice in Scotland. She founded a Menzies Campbell lecture series, similar to the one started by her husband at the RCSEng Faculty of Dental Surgery at each of the three Scottish dental schools - Glasgow, Dundee and Edinburgh.  Personal life  She married John Menzies Campbell, a dentist also based in Buckingham Terrace, on the 23 December 1924 at St. George's Presbyterian Church, Darlington. Campbell was a collector or dental implements and an historian of dentistry. After their marriage, Margaret became his partner in this interest, and maintained it even after his death. She died in 1990.  Awards and honours  In 1977, she was awarded an honorary Fellowship of the Faculty of Dental Surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons for her work on the history of dentistry. She was the first woman to receive this honour. She was also made a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

He served one season as a graduate manager at Ohio State before landing his first college coaching position as an assistant coach at Wabash Valley in 2005. Steele moved on to Indiana, where he started as the team's video coordinator in 2006, and was elevated to an assistant coach for the remainder of the 2008 season after Kelvin Sampson's contract was terminated by the Hoosiers as a result of NCAA recruiting violations.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/ind/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/0708-mbb-1-14.pdf After Indiana, Steele was hired by Sean Miller at Xavier for the 2008-09 season. Steele was retained by Chris Mack after Miller accepted the Arizona head coaching position, and has been a part of a Musketeers program that has been to eight NCAA tournaments, including an Elite Eight run in 2017, as well as being part of two Atlantic 10 regular season titles, and one Big East regular season title. On March 31, 2018, Steele was promoted to head coach to become the 18th head coach in Xavier history, replacing Mack who departed for Louisville. Travis Steele began his first season (2018 - 2019) with an entirely new coaching staff and a depleted bench, having lost most of Xavier's starters from the previous season to graduation or early declaration for the NBA draft. Xavier would enter the Big East part of their schedule at 8-5 in the non-conference schedule. Despite an early 6-game losing streak in the Big East conference schedule, Steele was able to lead the Musketeers on an end of the regular-season rally, winning 6 of their last 7 regular season conference match-ups. Xavier finished 3rd in the Big East (9-9) heading into the conference tourney. Likely needing a Big East championship to make the NCAA tournament, Xavier was able to win their first Big East tournament match-up against Creighton, before losing to Villanova in overtime in the Big East tournament semi-final. At 18-15, Xavier qualified for the NIT tournament and would fall in the 2nd Round on the road to the eventual NIT tournament champions, Texas, in overtime.

Biography  According to the prologue of Neilos' work on the patriarchs, he was in Palermo in 1142/43 at the court of king Roger II of Sicily. His signature appears at the bottom of an act, dated 1146, regarding the church of the Martorana in Palermo.Lidia Perria, \\"Una pergamena greca dell'anno 1146 per la chiesa di S. Maria del Ammiraglio\\", Quellen und Forschungen aus italienischen Archiven und Bibliotheken 61 (1981): 1‚Äì24. Everything else regarding his life is a matter of conjecture. Born into a Greek-Sicilian family with the name \\"Nicholas\\" he apparently made his career in Constantinople, where he held various high offices, both ecclesiastical and secular: deacon of the Hagia Sophia, patriarchal notary, protoproedros of the protosynkelloi and nomophylax.Vitalien Laurent, \\"L'≈ìuvre g√©ographique du moine sicilien Nil Doxopatris,\\" √âchos d'Orient, vol. 36, no. 185 (1937): 5‚Äì30, available online At some point he became a monk, assuming the monastic name \\"Neilos\\", and left for Sicily. Neilos Doxapatres shares a surname with John Doxapatres, a professor of rhetoric who taught in Constantinople in the eleventh century, but their relationship is unknown.  Works  Two works by Doxapatres have survived: * Treatise on the five patriarchs (' or '), a work of geography and ecclesiastical history commissioned by King Roger II of Sicily. In it, Doxapatres explores Byzantine ideas of the Universal Church, which were far removed from those of the papacy (as well as the other Greek theologians active in southern Italy). As a result, the work was very controversial in the West, and only two manuscript copies survive before 1453, but which were translated into Armenian around 1179/80. The first printed edition appeared in √âtienne Le Moine's collection Varia Sacra, seu Sylloge variorum opusculorum Gr√¶corum ad rem ecclesiasticam spectantium, 2 vols. (Leiden, 1685). * A Useful Inquiry into the Divine Economy in Relationship to Man ('), a vast theological summa apparently conceived of in five books, of which only the first two have survived‚Äî‚Äîalthough we don't know whether the other three were ever, in fact, written. The first book discusses, in 263 chapters, the creation of man, Paradise, and the Fall; the second devoted 203 chapters to Christ, the second Adam, who repairs the sins for the first and saves humanity through his Incarnation and Passion. Book I was inspired above all by Gregory of Nyssa's On the creation of man and Nemesius's On the nature of man, Book II by the commentaries of Theophylact of Ohrid. Books III and IV, based on their titles, were probably meant to discuss the later history of the apostles and the Church.

Originally built as a medical clinic in 1963, the building served a variety of other commercial purposes before it was demolished by its owners in 2018. Before its demolition, it was one of three Wright-designed structures in the state of Montana. He had previously designed the Bitter Root Inn in Stevensville, which burned down in 1924, and the Como Orchards Summer Colony complex in Darby, of which only two small cottages survive.LeCocq, Randall. Frank Lloyd Wright in Montana: Darby, Stevensville, and Whitefish, Drumlummon Institute, 2013. When the clinic building was demolished in 2018, it became the first of Wright's intact non-residential buildings to be intentionally destroyed since the Francisco Terrace apartment complex in Chicago was torn down in 1974,Gibson, Eleanor. \\"Bulldozer demolishes Frank Lloyd Wright medical centre in Montana\\", Dezeen, January 12, 2018. and the first of any kind since the W.S. Carr House in Grand Beach, Michigan was demolished in 2004.\\"Even a Wright can be a teardown\\", Chicago Tribune, November 13, 2004. History Thaddeus Leon Lockridge, a practicing physician in Whitefish, Montana, approached Frank Lloyd Wright to commission him for the design of a new medical clinic building in 1958. Reportedly, Lockridge and his wife chose Wright, by then one of the most famous architects in America, after a Montana architectural firm quoted them a price so \\"exorbitantly high\\" that they decided they \\"may as well have Frank Lloyd Wright design it\\".Hintze, Lynnette. \\"Historic Whitefish building listed on National Register\\", Daily Inter Lake, September 15, 2012. Wright drew up plans for the building with his close assistant, John H. \\"Jack\\" Howe. The design was among Wright's last works, as he died the following year. Construction began in the summer of 1959, after Wright's death, with the carpenter visiting Taliesin to study Wright's methods.\\"New Clinic Will Be Built In Whitefish This Summer\\", Kalispell Daily Inter Lake, April 14, 1959. Taliesin Associated Architects (Wright's successor firm) was not involved with the construction process.Steiner, Douglas. \\"Wright Studies: Lockridge Medical Clinic, Whitefish, Montana\\", The Wright Library, 2008.

McIntyre obituary, Daily Inter Lake, April 30, 2013. joined Lockridge's practice in anticipation of the building's completion, although they protested the Wright design. At , the clinic was one of the town's largest buildings, and was compared to \\"half of Montana\\". Its layout was based around a grid with units of four feet.Storrer, William Allin. The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, Fourth Edition: A Complete Catalog, University of Chicago Press, 2017. The design of the building was based on Wright's Usonian houses. Its most noticeable design element, a ceiling-high plastic sphere embedded in the front facade and surrounded by a planter, was removed later after a \\"vehicular mishap\\",Inbody, Kristen. \\"Developer demolishes Frank Lloyd Wright building in Montana\\", Great Falls Tribune, January 11, 2018. to provide a more direct entrance to the lobby.Sanderson, Arlene. A Guide to Frank Lloyd Wright Public Places: Wright Sites, Princeton Architectural Press, 2001. The sphere, which was well-lit and resembled a full moon, was used as a terrarium, and later owners of the building attempted to restore it to the facade but could not find any remaining pieces. The building's prominent rooftop gardens remained, but the flowers were removed to make way for HVAC equipment. The clinic opened for business in 1960. Dr. Lockridge died in 1963,\\"Dr. Lockridge, Whitefish, Dies\\", Kalispell Daily Inter Lake, August 2, 1963. and the other doctors moved out the following year. First State Bank occupied the building from 1964 to 1980, and after that it was divided into three professional offices, which held a variety of tenants including the administrative offices for Iron Horse, an upscale subdivision and golf course in Whitefish. In 2002, the building was purchased again and became the law offices of Sharon and Frank Morrison and Sean and Diana Frampton. The Morrisons, inspired by Wright's Harvey P. Sutton House in their hometown of McCook, Nebraska, decided to restore the building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. After the law partnership between the Morrisons and Framptons ended in 2016, the building, locally known as the Frank Lloyd Wright Building, was sold to Mick Ruis, a developer from Columbia Falls, Montana who presented his plans to demolish the building and replace it with a three-story mixed-use development late that year.Hintze, Lynnette. \\"Whitefish historic landmark headed for wrecking ball\\", Daily Inter Lake, November 15, 2016. He was apparently unaware when he submitted the plans that the building was protected and considered historic, but after being made aware of this he nevertheless continued with his plans to raze it, which was originally slated for late 2018.McGrath, Katherine. \\"Update: Spiteful Developer Tore Down Frank Lloyd Wright Building Overnight, Eclipsing Negotiations to Save It\\", Architectural Digest, January 9, 2018. Local residents and members of the Montana Preservation Alliance led a movement to save the building. On January 3, 2018, the owner began preparing for demolition, leading the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy to reach out with an offer to purchase the building. The conservancy and its allies were willing to pay the full asking price, but sparred with the developers over whether the deposit could be refundable. According to the conservancy, the time frame of one week was not enough for them to raise funds to pay the non-refundable deposit. Ruis had set a January 10 deadline for the negotiations, which ended without a deal on the afternoon of the 10th. Hours later, before preservationists could make any effort to start a second round of negotiations, the building was demolished overnight. The demolition outraged preservationists and scholars of Wright and modern architecture, both locally and across the country. A billboard appeared in Whitefish two months after the clinic building was razed, calling for residents to boycott Ruis and the development that would replace the building.McGrath, Katherine. \\"New Billboard Protests the Demolition of a Frank Lloyd Wright Building\\", Architectural Digest, March 26, 2018.

The majority of her work focused on landscapes in the American West. She has been called the first resident female artist in Colorado.  Early life  Helen Henderson was born to George Henry Porter and Sarah Maria (Bacon) Henderson in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1849. The family moved to Antioch, CA when Helen was young. When Helen's mother died in 1862, she moved back to Indianapolis to reside with an aunt. Helen stayed in the Midwest through her formal education, attending Methodist College and graduating from Illinois Female College (present-day MacMurry College) in 1869. She received some formal art training as a part of her education. She married James Albert Chain in 1871, and the couple moved to Colorado.  Life in Colorado  In Denver, James Chain established a book and stationery store that also sold art supplies. Chain used part of the space as her studio and also taught art students, including famous Rocky Mountain landscape painter Charles Partridge Adams. She continued to study art as well. Among her mentors were Hamilton Hamilton and Hudson River School painter George Inness. Chain was inspired by the outdoors and preferred to do her sketches on location, which often meant climbing mountains, such as Pikes Peak, Grey's Peak, and Long's Peak. She was the first woman to climb the Mount of the Holy Cross, which she did in 1877. The Chains traveled throughout the West, including trips to Arizona, New Mexico, and California and famous landmarks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Yellowstone. Chain is reported to be the first woman to have painted the Grand Canyon. On these trips they were accompanied by famous artists such as Thomas Moran and William Henry Jackson. Chain was the first woman to exhibit at New York's National Academy of Design, where two of her paintings of New Mexico Pueblos were shown in 1882. Margaret Tobin Brown owned one of her works, which can be seen at the Molly Brown House Museum today. Chain was also noted for being a humanitarian. After anti- Chinese riots in Denver in 1880, she began to use the storefront of the Chains' bookstore to teach English to Chinese immigrants.  Death  The Chains embarked on a global tour in March 1892. While in Japan, Chain sent home art in Japanese style back to the Denver Fortnightly Club. On October 10, 1892, they were crossing the South China Sea between Shanghai and Hong Kong when their steamship sank during a typhoon. The Chains both drowned, along with the other passengers on board their ship, Bokhara.

He was educated at Northwich grammar school, admitted sizar at St. John's College, Cambridge, on 1 April 1642, and incorporated M.A. at Oxford on 5 July 1656. Career He succeeded Thomas Porter as rector of Hanmer, Flintshire, probably in 1650. Henry Newcome visited him there on 10 June 1654. He was a member of the fourth Shropshire classis (constituted by parliament in April 1647), and, as such, was one of the ordainers of Philip Henry on 16 September 1657. Thirty years later (9 May 1687) he was one of the ordainers, at his own house in London, of Philip Henry's son, Matthew Henry. In September 1660 he was presented at Flint assizes for not reading the common prayer; the prosecution fell through, owing to Charles II's declaration in October. He was again presented at the spring assizes on 28 March 1661 at Hawarden. He resigned his living in consequence of the Uniformity Act of 1662, preaching a farewell sermon (17 August), in which he said he was ejected for not subscribing his assent to the new prayer-book, which he had not yet seen. He continued to communicate at Hanmer, where he received ‚Äòsitting‚Äô on 19 April 1663. On 25 July he was presented for baptising his own children, and in October was arrested on suspicion of treason. Early in 1665 he was made collector for Hanmer of the ‚Äòroyal aid,‚Äô the point being to treat him as a layman.

He is most notable for having served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives, Vermont Senate, and Minnesota House of Representatives. Biography Orlando Stevens was born in Rutland, Vermont on October 12, 1797, the son of David Stevens and Polly (Crafts) Stevens. Orlando Stevens was raised in St. Albans, and was educated at the Franklin County Grammar School and Castleton Seminary. He then studied law with Asa Aldis, was admitted to the bar in 1819, and began to practice in Swanton. In 1822, Stevens married Parma Fisk (1805-1854), the daughter of James Fisk. At the time, Fisk was the U.S. Collector of Customs in Swanton, and he appointed Stevens as his deputy. Stevens later moved to East Highgate, where he continued to practice law while becoming involved in the lumber business, followed by relocation to St. Albans, where he established a successful law practice. A Whig, Stevens served as state's attorney of Franklin County from 1839 to 1842. From 1845 to 1846 he served in the Vermont House of Representatives. From 1852 to 1853, Stevens served in the Vermont Senate, and was chosen to serve as the Senate's President pro tempore. After serving in the Vermont Senate, Stevens relocated to Winona, Minnesota, where he continued to practice law. By now a Republican, from 1859 to 1860, Stevens was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives. He later suffered a stroke which left him partly paralyzed, and he decided to return to St. Albans, where he lived in retirement. Death and burial Stevens died in St. Albans on March 25, 1879, and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in St. Albans. Family The children of Orlando Stevens and Parma Fisk included daughter Parma, who was the wife of David Olmsted, the first mayor of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

The player must dig tunnels so three people can cross from one side of the screen to the other. Gameplay Presented in a side-view, roughly the bottom 40% of the screen is dirt and above that, sky. The player controls both an auger-- which digs tunnels when moved through dirt--and a spelunker who can only move through cleared tunnels. The joystick button switches between control of the auger and spelunker. Boulders slow down the auger's drilling. The goal is to clear a path so the spelunker, who starts on the left side of the screen, can exit the right side, then repeat the process for two more spelunkers. All three must be freed over the course of one animated day/night cycle. The sky is occupied by large and small birds, called alien bird creatures and alien probe birds in the manual. The large birds drop rods which block tunnels. The small birds inject a fungus into the ground which spreads and is deadly to spelunkers. Both obstacles can be cleared with the auger. When controlling the spelunker, moving the joystick in a circle drops a bomb which removes dirt and fungus. The probe birds can be killed if an exploding bomb hits the fungus injector before the injection process is complete. =Multiplayer= From 1 to 3 other players (depending on the number of joystick ports) can control probe birds, affecting the primary player's game. This can be done at any time without enabling a specific gameplay mode. Reception In a 2 out of 4 joystick review for Electronic Fun with Computers & Games, Paul Backer complained of the difficulty in planting bombs with a circular joystick motion, and also pointed out that a secondary player can easily finish off a spelunker by planting fungus directly in front of it. He concluded, \\"This is a sound premise upon which to build a game. Unfortunately, the designers failed to provide an exciting challenge.\\" The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game a \\"D\\" rating: \\"The game just isn't exciting and can become frustrating, and I think most players will lose interest quickly.\\" References External links *Boulders and Bombs at Atari Mania *Bug list at Atari Compendium *Gameplay video category:1983 video games Category:Action video games category:Atari 8-bit family games category:Atari 8-bit family-only games Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Boulders and Bombs"},{"id":"56996201","text":"Dietrich und Wenezlan (Dietrich and Wenezlan) is a fragmentary Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great. It usually considered part of the so-called \\"historical\\" Dietrich material, as it appears to cite Dietrich's exile at the court of Etzel described in the \\"historical poems\\" Dietrichs Flucht and the Rabenschlacht. The fragment of about 500 lines tells of Dietrich's challenge by Wenezlan of Poland, who has captured one of Dietrich's warriors. It is unclear whether the fragment was the main focus of a poem or a single episode from a longer poem. Summary Dietrich und Wenezlan has only survived in a single, incomplete and fragmentary version of about 499 rhyming couplets. Dietrich is at the court of Etzel, when Wolfhart, who, along with Hildebrand, has been captured by Wenezlan, arrives to tell him that Wenezlan wants to engage Dietrich in single combat ‚Äì if Dietrich wins, then Wenezlan will release Wolfhart and Hildebrand. Initially, Dietrich seems reluctant, but when Wolfhart grows angry and accuses Dietrich of cowardice, saying that if Dietrich refuses Wenezlan will attack Etzel with an army, Dietrich says he had been joking and of course would fight to free his vassals. There is then a lacuna. The combat between Dietrich and Wenezlan begins in between their two armies and in the company of courtly ladies. When they have dehorsed each other, they fight on foot all day. The fragment ends before a conclusion is reached. Manuscript transmission and dating Dietrich und Wenezlan is transmitted in a single manuscript fragment of two leaves: *√ñffentliche Bibliothek der Universit√§t Basel, Cod. N I 1 Nr. 67, parchment, north-eastern Bavarian dialect, around 1250. The text itself may have been written around the same time as the manuscript. Alternatively it may have been written earlier. Due to stylistic influence from Wolfram von Eschenbach (died c. 1220), it cannot have been written earlier than 1220. It appears to predate the other historical poems in the Dietrich cycle by at least a decade. Genre Dietrich und Wenezlanis one of the few Dietrich poems written in rhyming couplets. The poem only loosely fits into the category of \\"historical Dietrich poems,\\" although it clearly takes place within the exile situation described in Dietrichs Flucht and the Rabenschlacht. Victor Millet challenges this classification as uncertain on the grounds that the poem is too fragmentary. The challenge to single combat is more reminiscent of the fantastical poems. Dietrich's initial refusal to fight and the accusation of cowardice (zagheit) also has more in common with the fantastical poems, where this is a frequent occurrence. His admission that he was merely playing a joke may be a game played by the author. Wenezlan challenges Dietrich to combat by the honor of all women, another aspect more reminiscent of the fantastical poems and courtly romance. Elisabeth Lienert thus describes Dietrich und Wenezlan as between the two groups of Dietrich poems: at the same time the poem offers an alternative to the sort of fighting found in poems such as Dietrichs Flucht in that it is fairly and chivalrous. Relation to the oral tradition Wenezlan von B√¥l√¢n (Poland) is possibly inspired by Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. However, Wenezlan is king of Poland and his warriors are actually Riuzen (Russians), something that weakens the connection to Wenceslaus. The name Wenezlan is also similar to Witzl√¢n of Bohemia, an enemy of Etzel's in Biterolf und Dietleib. Gerhard Eis argued that the source for the poem is a Low German oral tale about Dietrich's battles against the Slavs, basing his theory on the presence of such battles in the Thidrekssaga, some of which show parallels to Wolfhard's captivity, and the mentioning of battles against Russians and Wilzen in a poem by Der Marner. Although Joachim Heinzle finds this suggestion unlikely, Victor Millet finds it plausible.

Personal life Louis Heinrici was born on 30 July 1847 in Torgau and died c.1930 in Zwickau. He married Marie Elisabeth (Born Deustler) with whom he had three sons: Joseph Hans Louis Heinrici, Ernst Hermann Heinrici and Rudolf Heinrici. Business In 1876, Louis Heinrici began to manufacture hot air engines, and other small engines, initially in rented rooms. His first factory building was built in 1884 in Zwickau (Saxony). The factory started with two workers, a lathe and a forge. The official company name was: Louis Heinrici, mechanical workshops for precision work, Zwickau in Saxony. The hot-air engines produced by Heinrici, as a mass- produced product, were widely used in the commercial and private sectors because they served as inexpensive and reliable sources of power. In 1914, the factory had areas for metalworking, plumbing, a paint shop, another building for the turning shop and a laboratory and trial room for test runs, as well as an office building for sales offices and warehouses. In the park-like landscaped gardens were ponds 4 metres in diameter. These were provided with decorative fountains, which were powered by Heinrici engines. In his 1914 catalogue, Heinrici stated: \\"Today after 38 years of activity, I still make the same article on a large scale, which I - thanks to thorough study of all relevant issues of a scientific and technical nature for the construction of such machines, as well as tireless forward striving for attainable perfection - have achieved first place in world trade\\". After 38 years, Heinrici had sold 21,000 machines. Hot air engines For several decades, Louis Heinrici had built hot air engines in twelve sizes from 26 to 190 mm piston diameter and in the power range from 1.5 W to 0.2 kW. The larger machines used liquid cooling while, in the smaller ones, air cooling was sufficient. The running speed under load was between 120 and 200 revolutions per minute. The power output, by piston diameter, was: * 26 mm = 1/550 hp * 40 mm = 1/60 hp * 80 mm = 1/12 hp * 100 mm = 1/8 hp * 190 mm = 1/2 hp The above may not be a complete list. The Stirling Engine website gives some intermediate sizes. In the 1920s, Ernst Heinrici introduced an improved engine which could be run at up to 400 rpm. It was available in six sizes from 1/50 to 1/2 horsepower and was on sale up to 1940. The machines could be heated by gas, liquid or solid fuels (luminescent gas, kerosene, wood). They weighed between 26 kg for the smallest and 660 kg for the largest machine. Engineer E. Patzert, then a teacher of engineering at a school in Zwickau, carried out tests on some Heinrici machines and stated in his test report: \\"The experimental engines, all of which were chosen casually from a number of completed machines, were characterized by quiet, steady running and were, in terms of lubrication and maintenance, extremely undemanding\\". =Advantages= Advantages of the machines included: * Noiseless operation, * Slow running - minimum wear * No smell (exhaust gases) * Easy operation, ready for immediate use * Completely safe * Can be heated by any fuel * Can be erected anywhere, without official approval. * No dependence on gas, electricity or water =Applications= * Fans and blowers * Shop window advertising turntable * Turntable for Christmas tree stand * Driving all kinds of water pumps * Operation of fountains * Electricity generation with a dynamo * Agitators and shakers in hospitals, laboratories and the chemical industry References  External links  * Hot-Air Machine, Louis Heinrici, 1925 * Reproduction of a Heinrici hot air engine * Restoration of a Heinrici Hot Air Engine Category:Engineers from Saxony Category:1847 births Category:1930 deaths Category:People from Torgau ","title":"Louis Heinrici"},{"id":"56996376","text":"Stella Ashcroft (born 27 July 2002) is an artistic gymnast from New Zealand, specialising in the vault, beam and floor events.

He was monarchist Senator of Guadeloupe from 1876 to 1885. Early years (1824‚Äì45) Charles-Andr√© de La Jaille was born in Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe, on 15 April 1824. His father was Charles-Andr√© de La Jaille (1796‚Äì1882), son of the marquis Fran√ßois Charles de La Jaille (1774‚Äì1801) and a cavalry lieutenant in the king's bodyguard of the company of the Duke of Wagram. His mother was Caroline Fran√ßois Camille du Bois de La Saussaye d'Estrelan (c. 1802‚Äì1851). He was the second child and second boy in a large family. He entered the √âcole Polytechnique in 1843 and became a 2nd lieutenant of artillery in 1845. Military career (1845‚Äì75) La Jaille was promoted to lieutenant in 1847 and captain in 1852. He was stationed in Toulouse at the start of the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56). He went to the Crimea as orderly officer of General de Lourmel(fr), who was killed during the Battle of Inkerman on 7 November 1854. He brought Lourmel's body back to France to be buried at Pontivy, and was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honour. He was appointed to the artillery of the Guard under squadron commander Laumi√®re, and returned at once to the Crimea. On 27 July 1855 a shell burst at his feet outside the Malakoff redoubt. It covered him with earth and pebbles and fractured his jaw, ending his campaign. On his return to France La Jaille was assigned to the Imperial Guard at the Tuileries Palace. During the Franco- Austrian War La Jaille fought at the Battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) where his battery took the bridge over the Naviglio Grande from the Austrians. La Jaille placed his pieces to the right and left of the bridge of Boffalora sopra Ticino. His fire opened the bridge to the French infantry, who crossed it but were driven back by a regiment of Tyrolean chasseurs, who captured one of the guns. At the Battle of Solferino (24 June 1859) his placement of the guns enabled the Guards division to take the Mont des Cypr√®s height. The emperor saw the maneuver, verbally congratulated him and made him an office of the Legion of Honour. La Jaille was promoted to squadron commander on 1 August 1860. He fought with distinction during the French intervention in Mexico. He was Chief of Staff to General de Laumi√®re, who was killed during the Siege of Puebla on 6 April 1863 . He was cited for his actions at the battle of San Lorenzo(fr) (May 1863). On 13 August 1863 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. As of April 1864 he was president of the Geology and Minerals section of the Commission Scientifique, Litteraire et Artistique de Mexico. He was noted for the skill of his artillery placement at the siege of Oaxaca, which surrendered on 9 February 1865. After his return to France on 6 June 1867 he was promoted to colonel. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870) La Jaille commanded the reserve artillery of Marshal Edmond Le B≈ìuf's 3rd army corps. He served during the Siege of Metz, which capitulated on 27 October 1870, and then became a captive in Bonn. In 1871 he commanded the reserve artillery of the Versailles army during the suppression of the Paris Commune. He was promoted to brigadier general on 24 June 1871. He was stationed at Bourges and commanded the 5th infantry brigade of the 8th army corps. He was given three stars (divisional general) on 15 March 1877. He was appointed a member of the artillery committee in 1877 and was president of the artillery committee in 1882. He was appointed Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1882. He had served for 41 years in 11 campaigns with one injury and three citations. Political career (1876‚Äì92) During the senatorial elections of 1876 La Jaille was elected on 27 February 1876 as Senator of Guadeloupe on a monarchist platform by 29 votes against 27 to the Republican candidate. His election was validated despite serious challenges, since the municipal councils of Guadeloupe had not been reelected within the legal deadline. He sat with the extreme right. He was called \\"a stronger Royalist than the Comte de Chambord. In the senate he approved the acts of Patrice de MacMahon in the 16 May 1877 crisis, and voted in June for the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies. He then spoke against the policy of the Dufaure ministry, against reform of the judicial personnel, against reestablishment of the divorce, against credits for the Tonkin Campaign. La Jaille did not stand for re- election on 25 January 1885 in the triennial renewal of the Senate. He died in Paris on 5 August 1892 without having married.

EspinoZa is the middle child of 14 siblings growing up in Fraser, Colorado, and attended the Rocky Mountain School of the Arts in the 1960s and the University of Colorado Denver. During the 1960s she participated in the Centro Cultural Center, organizing exhibitions for artists and was involved in the 1969 \\"Hispano Art Fiesta / Cinco de Mayo\\" events in Denver.

The surviving mural, Mexican Heros, painted in 1966, depicts Pancho Villa and Benito Juarez and was hung at the Crusade for Justice center. EspinoZa is well known for her mural of La Guadalupe that is found on the altar of Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Denver. She obtained permission to paint this work by asking for the space from Pastor Jose Lara who claims to have told EspinoZa, \\"You don't have to have a picture of a perfect Lady of Guadalupe like in Mexico. Please paint a beautiful Chicana from north Denver.\\" The mural, The Apparition of the Virgin Mary to Juan Diego in Mexico, was painted in 1976 and was on the altar until Father Benito Hernandez and church leadership had it removed it in 2010 under claims that the mural took away from the focus of the Holy presence. This removal stirred protests calling for the mural's return, including the gathering of 70 signatures for a letter to Denver Archbishop Charles Chaput demanding the murals restoration at the church, with EspinoZa agreeing to perform the restoration work if the church decides to remove the wall.

History  The castle was built around 1100 by the counts of Bogen. After this dynasty died out in 1242, the castle fell to the Duke of Bavaria. In 1308, the Bavarian Duke Otto and Stephen of Lower Bavaria enfeoffed Lord Eberwein of Degenberg with the castle. In 1339/40, the castle became the property of the Degenbergs. When the Degenbergs rose up against Duke Albert IV,in the B√∂ckler War, ducal troops under George of Lerchenfeld appeared in front of the castle on 9 December 1468. Shortly before Christmas, Wei√üenstein Castle was captured and burned down. However, the Degenbergs rebuilt it and remained here until their extinction in 1602 when Hans Sigmund of Degenberg died. The castle fell to Elector Maximilian I who established the seat of the electoral Pfleger here. In 1633, during the Thirty Years' War, the castle was ravaged by the Swedish. In 1740, the south side of the castle collapsed, in 1742 Franz von der Trenck and his Pandurs finally destroyed the castle. Since then, the castle has been in ruins, while the official residence and farm buildings have been restored. In 1762 a tower-like building was added, which also served as the so-called a \\"grain box\\" for the tithes of the subjects. In 1918, the writer, Siegfried von Vegesack, bought the house and made it his residence. He called it Das fressende Haus (\\"The House that Eats\\"), due to its high costs. This is also the title of his novel published in 1932.  Description  The ruin, an elongated complex on a rock terrace, is separated from its domestic buildings. Besides some masonry, the square tower house has survived. The castle ruins of Wei√üenstein have been owned by the town of Regen since 1996. From 1991 to 1995 the ruin was renovated and is now accessible to the public. Since 1985, the Fressende Haus has housed a museum and literary archive on the poet, Siegfried von Vegesack. In addition, sacred art, equipment for flax and linen production and a large collection of snuff are exhibited here. Occasionally poetry readings and other events take place here. Below the ruins is an 1836 chapel with a baroque altar and numerous votive tablets.  Nature reserve  The Pfahl Nature Reserve near the Ruins of Weissenstein (Naturschutzgebiet Pfahl bei der Ruine Wei√üenstein) was created by the governments of Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate on 18 April 1940 (RegAnz. Ausg. 112/114). It covers an area of 6 hectares and extends over the rocky area including the ruins. This measure prevents all quarrying of quartz on the Pfahl. The castle hill is more densely covered in trees than the rest of the Pfahl due to centuries of fertilisation with waste. Sycamore, elder, birch and ash thrive here. Weissenstein am Regen1.jpgView of the ruins from the south Weissenstein am Regen 3.jpgInside the tower house Weissenstein am Regen 2.jpgView from the tower house of the ruins  Legend  According to a legend, a knight's wife wanted to drown her seven newborn children. The knight returned and prevented this and had his children raised in Rinchnach Monastery, but did not tell his wife. The children returned to the castle as grown men. When the lord of the castle asked what should happen to a person who had his or her own children killed, his wife replied that the person should be walled in alive. Thereupon she was walled in and is still to be seen today as a \\"white woman\\" in the ruins.

Ct. 1800 (2018). Facts China Agritech is incorporated in Delaware and operates primarily in Beijing, China. According to the company, it manufactures and sells various agricultural products to Chinese farmers. China Agritech shares were first listed on NASDAQ in 2005. Four years later, in 2009, China Agritech reported a threefold increase in net revenue. NASDAQ initiated delisting proceedings against China Agritech's stock in 2011 after the company's shareholders made allegations of fraudulent business practices. The company's shareholders filed two successive class action lawsuits in 2011 and 2012, but were denied class certification in both cases. Michael Resh, a shareholder, brought a third class action in 2014. Procedural history China Agritech moved to dismiss Resh's complaint because the two year limitations period set by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 had already passed. The district court granted China Agritech's motion to dismiss. According to the District Court, under the Supreme Court's prior case, American Pipe & Construction v. Utah, individual claims against the company were tolled during the two class actions filed in 2011 and 2012, but the American Pipe did not reach the issue of whether the tolling rule also applied to a new class action based on a \\"substantially identical\\" class. The Ninth Circuit reversed the District court, holding that a class action was not time- barred in cases where the plaintiff's were unnamed in the prior lawsuits, even if the complaint was made against many of the same defendants, and based upon the same events. Supreme Court In an opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that upon denial of class certification, a plaintiff cannot commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations, and must promptly join an existing suit or file an individual action.

History Jimmy Carter in 1937 Archery was laid out in 1913. The community was named by William D. Johnson, an A.M.E. bishop, after the \\"Sublime Order of Archery\\", an A.M.E. social service organization benefiting poor blacks. The historic railroad community was originally built up chiefly by African Americans, who then formed a majority of its population. A large share of the residents engaged in sharecropping. Archery was first electrified in 1938. Amenities in the community included a train depot, schoolhouse, and country store. U.S. President Jimmy Carter grew up at Archery on his family's farm from age four, in 1928, until he left for college in 1941. In Carter's time, the population consisted of approximately 25 black families and 2 white families, namely the Watsons and Carters. President Carter recalled in 1976 that Bishop Johnson was \\"the best-educated, most famous, the most widely traveled, and the richest member of the community\\". The Carter family remained at Archery until 1949; ownership of the Carter property was transferred to the National Park Service in 1994.

It was invented by Lyman C. Craig and Otto W. Post. A Craig tube consists of two parts. The first is a stout-walled test tube with a working volume of about 1-5 ml (say, 7-8 cm in length and 1-1.5 cm in diameter). There is a constriction towards the open end of the tube. The second is a loosely-fitting generally-cylindrical stopper, possibly with a teardrop-shaped head, of glass or of another inert material such as PTFE, which seats on the constriction. Recrystallisation is carried out in the usual manner, by dissolving the solid to be purified in a solvent and causing crystals of the solid to form. The stopper can be used to protect the solution from atmospheric contamination. The crystals are separated from the mother liquor by placing the tube and stopperinvertedin a centrifuge tube, followed by centrifugation. The stopper allows the mother liquor to pass into the centrifuge tube but retains the crystals, which can subsequently be recrystallised again or collected. The apparatus has the advantages that the crystallised product is relatively dry, is free from contamination by fibres from filter paper, and can be recovered more efficiently than from a sinter funnel. Craig tubes can be made by competent glassblowers, and are also available commercially.

Career and research Lorimer is recognized for his work on mechanism of two proteins, RuBisCO and the GroE chaperonins. Rubisco is the enzyme responsible for photosynthetic carbon fixation, and the GroE chaperonins enable the Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent folding of many other proteins. Using Oxygen-18 Lorimer demonstrated the oxygenase activity of RuBisCO, both in vivo and in vitro. He further established the novel mechanism for the activation of RuBisCO by carbon dioxide, the formation of a lysyl-carbamate in the active site. With his colleagues at DuPont he employed chemical quench and other techniques to trap and identify the 6-carbon reaction intermediate of the carboxylation reaction and defined the complete stereo-chemical course of the reaction. In 1989, using an unequivocally unfolded protein and the purified chaperonin proteins GroEL and GroES, his group was the first to demonstrate the ATP-dependent folding of RuBisCO and many other proteins. With Devarajan (Dave) Thirumalai he performed a bioinformatic analysis to define the structural elements of the substrate proteins that GroEL recognizes. Lorimer has also shown that GroEL can perform work on substrate protein during allosteric transitions. He has determined the crystal structure of the functional form, the symmetric GroEL:GroES2 ‚Äúfootball‚Äù and established that the GroEL rings operate as parallel-processing, iterative annealing machines. =Awards and honors= Lorimer is a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) of London.

It is a critical first-hand account of the current state of the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The title is a play on words: the book is not about criminal lawbreaking, but about how the legal system is failing in its purpose. Author The book's dustjacket states that the author, \\"The Secret Barrister\\", is a junior barrister practising criminal law before the courts of England and Wales. \\"The Secret Barrister\\" is also a blogger who in 2016 and 2017 was named Independent Blogger of the Year at the Editorial Intelligence Comment Awards. As of the book's publication date in March 2018 the author had a substantial following on Twitter of nearly 88,000. Principal themes The book is loosely structured to follow the life of a criminal case from magistrates' court, through to sentence and appeal. It mixes first-hand accounts of the author as advocate, acting at different times for the prosecution and the defence, with a discussion of how the system in practice fails to deliver justice on a daily basis: \\"Access to justice, the rule of law, fairness to defendants, justice for victims ‚Äì those fine emblems which we purport to hold so dear ‚Äì are each day incarnated in effigy, rolled out in the Crown and magistrates' courts and ritually torched\\". The author argues that the public should be outraged by the chronic underfunding of the criminal justice system: \\"In every crumbling, decaying magistrates‚Äô court and leaking Crown Court in the land, we see every day the law's equivalent of untreated, neglected patients on hospital trolleys. And every day it is met by a wall of silence\\". The almost insuperable difficulties of ensuring that defendants are defended properly and prosecuted fairly are laid out: \\"The magistrates' court is the accident and emergency department of criminal justice: any moment a problem will walk through the door and the prosecutor will have to deal with it blind. Much prosecuting in the magistrates‚Äô court takes the form of someone getting to their feet and presenting a case they have never set eyes on before\\". The author is particularly critical of reforms to legal aid under LASPO (the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012), called in the book \\"The Innocence Tax\\", under which a defendant can be wrongly accused of a crime by the state, denied legal aid and ‚Äì when acquitted ‚Äì find themselves out of pocket by tens or even hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees that the state will not repay. The author also addresses policy issues, and argues that \\"a working criminal justice system, properly resourced and staffed by dedicated professionals ... serves to protect the innocent, protect the public and protect the integrity, decency and humanity of our society. This should be a societal baseline. Not a luxury\\". The criminal justice system, the author argues, has suffered grievously in recent years from chronic underfunding. Its flaws are not those of the people who work within it, but are imposed from without: by the state. Each flaw is \\"either deliberately designed ‚Äì such as the Innocence Tax, or the restriction of compensation for miscarriages of justice ‚Äì or is the product of populist, tough-on-crime, anti-defendant posturing, or betrays warped spending priorities where politicians persuade voters that one penny off a pint of lager is a better investment than a working justice system\\". The author calls for proper resources to be made available to the legal system to enable it to deliver justice, for better public legal education including case law and statutes that are freely available online to the public to counter widespread public complacency (\\"it will never happen to me\\"), and for better education for backbench MPs to enable them to challenge government ministers or Ministry of Justice officials who use fallacious or dissembling arguments to gain support for a particular change in the law. The author pays tribute to the great dedication of the professionals who work within the system: the police officers, CPS prosecutors and caseworkers, defence solicitors, judges and magistrates, court staff, probation staff, prison officers and barristers. But \\"It is not the enemy within, betraying our ideals of justice ... but the enemy outside. Today's danger is not the actors, but the director; the state moving the pieces and pulling the strings ... The end result is the same. When we lose sight of justice, it unfastens and floats away, leaving us with a nominal legal system; but not a justice system\\".  Parliament  On the day of the book's publication it was commended in the House of Commons by the shadow Leader of the House, Valerie Vaz: \\"I suggest that the Leader of the House and all members of the Government read the book by \\"The Secret Barrister\\", who states: 'Walk into any court in the land, speak to any lawyer, ask any judge and you will be treated to uniform complaints of court deadlines being repeatedly missed, cases arriving underprepared, evidence lost, disclosures of evidence not being made, victims made to feel marginalised and millions of pounds of public money wasted. The suggestion was taken up by the Criminal Bar Association and Young Legal Aid Lawyers who launched a campaign \\"Help us tell every MP criminal justice is in crisis\\" to fund the provision of a copy of the book for every Member of Parliament. The target of ¬£10,000 was reached in three days, and it was reported that the book's publisher has pledged to match the donation. Critical reception In the week after its publication in March 2018 the book was placed at number 14 in Amazon's top 20 bestsellers list and reached the Sunday Times top five. It remained in the Sunday Times Top 10 Bestsellers list for twenty-four weeks. The reception of professional book reviewers was uniformly positive. Writing in The Observer, Alexander Larman called the book \\"terrifying and occasionally hilarious\\", an eye-opening if depressing account of the practice of law today. \\"The Secret Barrister\\" paints a picture of chaos in the courts, \\"from trials being endlessly postponed to unprepared barristers struggling through an underfunded and unfit system ... The author leaves us in no doubt that urgent reform is needed\\". Hannah Summers, in The Guardian, noted that the author paints a damning picture of a legal system in which violent abusers walk free because evidence has gone missing and in which lawyers do hours of unpaid work to keep the system from collapse. According to the author, \\"the courts in England and Wales have been brought to their knees by government cuts and left so plagued by daily errors they are no longer fit for purpose\\". For The Times, Imran Mahmood called the book both a lament and a celebration, carrying a message that is delivered with great skill. In reading it, he confessed to being surprised again and again at how damaged the criminal system is. The book tells us that \\"the liberty of the individual depends on us regarding the justice system as not just for criminals and victims but for all of us ‚Äì it is the symbol of our nation's humanity\\". It is \\"a devastating indictment\\", said Daniel Finkelstein, \\"telling tale after tale of cases that are not prosecuted properly and are not tried properly\\". Stephen Bates of the Literary Review called the book \\"a truly shocking account of the working of the English courts today\\". Fluently and engagingly written by an anonymous junior criminal barrister, according to Bates, the book tells of underfunded, dilapidated buildings, ever-lengthening trial delays and miscarriages of justice. Bates noted that \\"in a staggering 87 per cent of cases\\" audit trails show the disclosure of evidence to defence lawyers from the police or by the hassled, overworked and understaffed Crown Prosecution Service to be unsatisfactory. In CL&J; Criminal Law and Justice Weekly Jon Robins wrote that the book \\"shines an unflinching light on the nightmare of our courts\\", with chronic underfunding, staggering inefficiency and deathly managerialism being endemic within the system. He noted that austerity has hit the criminal justice system hard, and quoted the book's author as making it evident how dangerous a place the courts have become should you have the misfortune to end up there. That fate could happen to anyone, a thought that Robins considered \\"terrifying\\". He noted that the author lays bare the risk posed to all of us by a chronically underfunded justice system, politicians rarely having \\"to live with the consequences of their ill-thought out and occasionally cynical criminal justice policies\\". In The Times publication The Brief, Catherine Baksi called the book a rallying cry against short-sighted governments and an apathetic public who luxuriate in the misplaced confidence that they will never be wrongly accused of a crime. The book's author, she wrote, sets out with clarity and eloquence in a dozen angry, passionate and frustrated chapters a damning verdict on a system \\"close to breaking point\\", and \\"lays bare the result of the wrong-headed, short-sighted, politically expedient and dishonest drive to prosecute and defend on the cheap\\". She cited the author's view that the inexcusable \\"bargain basement retail model of justice\\" is no more than \\"roulette framed as justice\\" where decisions are \\"inconsistent, irrational and, at times, plainly unlawful\\". Theo Barclay set out for readers of The Daily Telegraph the author's principal allegation: \\"that successive governments have neglected and wilfully abused what was the jewel in the crown of the British constitution. The verdict? Guilty as charged\\". He noted that \\"Day-in, day-out, the innocent are punished and the guilty walk free because the system is underfunded, neglected, and failing those for whom it was designed to work\\". He expressed hope that \\"this excellent book will ... raise awareness of what has been, until now, a silent crisis\\". In the New Law Journal Chris Dale wrote that the book \\"make you hate politicians\\", pointing out that the conditions described are the result of decisions which \\"are the product of more than just budget-cutting; ideology and ignorance play their part, along with a cynical calculation about who votes for what\\". According to Mary Cowe for Counsel magazine, \\"this book is no rant. It is passionate advocacy of the highest standard, with all the sweary asides you can't say in court\\". This is \\"One of the best legal books of modern times\\" according to Kapil Summan of Scottish Legal News: \\"A panoptic account of its subject, measured and forensic throughout. [It is] the signal in a world of noise on justice matters and ‚Äì it is hoped ‚Äì a spur to action\\".

Every group had its own ideas about what the goals of the Revolution were and which course France (and surrounding countries) should follow. They struggled to carry out these plans at the cost of other groups. Various kinds of groups played an important role, such as citizens' clubs, parliamentarians, governmental institutions and paramilitary movements. * Society of the Friends of the Blacks: an abolitionist pressure group founded in 1788 by Jacques Pierre Brissot (later also the leader of the Girondins) just before the Revolution broke out. Although early revolutionaries would officially denounce slavery, this declaration was initially of little practical consequence.Encarta, s.v. \\"slavernij ¬ß4. De strijd tegen de slavernij\\". Not until the Haitian Revolution broke out in August 1791 did French politicians begin to seriously consider the factual abolition of slavery, which was eventually legislated on 4 February 1794. The gens de couleur libres (manumitted slaves) had already been granted civil rights on 4 April 1792. * Royalists: the term most commonly given to a wide range of supporters of the Ancien R√©gime who sought to reverse most changes of the Revolution and restore the royal House of Bourbon and the Catholic Church to its pre-1789 authority. Some armed themselves and formed rebel armies, especially in Western France, under the name of Catholic and Royal Army (also called Chouans, see also the Chouannerie), the most important battleground being the War in the Vend√©e (1793‚Äì1796). Others fled France as √©migr√©s, some of whom would also arm themselves and form the Arm√©e des √âmigr√©s (1792‚Äì1814), who together with the troops of the First Coalition and Second Coalition sought to bring down the French Republic and restore the Bourbon monarchy. * Jacobins (originally the Society of Friends of the Constitution, but better known by their home base in the old Dominican convent of Saint Jacques, hence the name Jacobins; since 1792 officially Society of Jacobins): revolutionary club originally consisting of Breton delegates to the National Constituent Assembly founded in June 1789, which soon grew and branched out across France and welcomed non-parliamentarians as members starting in October. Due to the expensive membership fee, the club remained elitist, initially shifting to the right. In Spring 1790, the radical leftist Cordeliers seceded and then in July 1791 the right-wing Feuillants also split themselves off. Together with the Cordeliers, the Jacobin left-wing would eventually come to be known as The Mountain while the right-wing of the Jacobins would become known as the Girondins.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Jakobijnen\\". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum. From 1790 onwards, Maximilien Robespierre would become increasingly dominant within the Jacobin Club and from July 1793 until July 1794 use it as his powerbase for the Reign of Terror, arresting and executing the leaders of both Cordelier factions, namely the radical leftist H√©bertists (March 1794) as well as the centre-left Dantonists (April 1794).Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Robespierre, Maximilien de\\". After the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre, the National Convention closed the Jacobin Club on 12 November 1794. * Monarchiens (officially the Friends of the Monarchial Constitution, also Monarchial Club): club of centre-right revolutionary monarchists founded in December 1789 by Jean Joseph Mounier. They merged with the Feuillants in 1791. * Society of 1789 (also known as the Patriotic Society of 1789): club of moderate conservative constitutional monarchists founded in May 1790. They merged with the Feuillants in 1791. * Cordeliers (officially the Society of the Friends of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, but better known by their home base in the old Franciscan Cordeliers Convent, hence Cordeliers): radical-leftist club which split from the Jacobins in the spring of 1790 under the leadership of Georges Danton and Camille Desmoulins.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Cordeliers, Club der\\". Together with the radical left Jacobins, they constituted The Mountain in Parliament.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Nationale Conventie\\". Until his assassination on 13 July 1793, radical demagogue Jean-Paul Marat played an important role as well. Thereafter, the club was taken over by the H√©bertists of Jacques H√©bert. Shortly after the execution of the H√©bertists leaders by Robespierre on 24 March 1794, the Cordeliers Club was closed down. * Feuillants (official the Society of the Friends of the Constitution): club of centre-right constitutional monarchists who held the majority in parliament during the Legislative Assembly era (October 1791‚ÄìSeptember 1792). They split from the Jacobins on 16 July 1791 and disappeared after the Storming of the Tuileries (10 August 1792). Although enemies of the Ancien R√©gime, they also opposed democracy. They maintained that the establishment of the constitutional monarchy on 3 September 1791 had meant the French Revolution had achieved its goal and should be finished.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Feuillants\\". National Convention in 1792 * Girondins (named after the Gironde department, where many of its prominent members came from; initially they were also called Brissotins after their leader Jacques Pierre Brissot): faction of liberal republicans who were primarily supported by the wealthy bourgeoisie from Southern and Western France. They consisted of the right-wing of the Jacobins and were staunch defenders of the rights of man and popular sovereignty against a centralised state governed from Paris. The Girondins desired to export the Revolution to the rest of Europe and therefore urged on war with Austria and Prussia (20 April 1792). They played a central role in the fall of the monarchy (21 September 1792) and the execution of the deposed king, Louis XVI (21 January 1793). Faced by the rise of The Mountain, the Girondins showed increasingly royalist tendencies in the spring of 1793. They were overthrown by the Montagnard insurrection of 31 May ‚Äì 2 June 1793 and their leaders were guillotined.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Girondijnen\\". * The Plain (La Plaine), also pejoratively known as The Marsh (Le Marais) or Maraisards (Marsh-dwellers), was a container term for a large group of parliamentarians who held middle-ground views and inside the National Convention were seated on the lowest benches. Ideologically, they were most closely affiliated with the Girondins, but they barely dared to speak out against the radical Montagnards. * The Mountain (La Montagne, also called the Montagnards, literally Mountain-dwellers, because they were seated on the highest benches in Parliament): grouping of radical and leftist politicians in the Legislative Assembly and National Convention (1792‚Äì1795).Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Montagnards\\". Their members came from the clubs of the Cordeliers and the left-wing of the Jacobins and sought to establish a radical-democratic republic centrally governed from Paris. From June 1793 until July 1794, the Montagnards dominated French politics and the Reign of Terror was conducted under the leadership of Robespierre.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"terreur\\". Notably after their takeover in June 1793, The Mountain can be thought of as consisting of three rival factions that vied for control, namely the H√©bertists (radical leftist Cordeliers), the Dantonists (moderate and more right-wing Cordeliers) and in between them Robespierre and his Jacobin followers (who together are sometimes called Robespierrists). * H√©bertists: radical left-wing of The Mountain primarily made up of Cordeliers. They are named for their leader Jacques H√©bert and were outspoken atheists, anti- Christians and republicans. They invented the Cult of Reason as an alternative Enlightened worldview to replace all religions. On 13 March 1794, the H√©bertist leaders were arrested and they were executed on 24 March by the order of Robespierre.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"H√©bert, Jacques Ren√©\\". * Dantonists: right-wing of The Mountain. They are named after their leader Georges Danton, a cofounder of the Cordeliers Club and from April until July 1793 the de facto head of the French government. After Robespierre seized power, Danton (who reconciled with Catholicism) and his allies tried to moderate and stabilise the Revolution. However, this brought them into conflict with the radical leftist H√©bertists who wished to push the Revolution even further. Robespierre had the Dantonist leaders (including Danton himself and Camille Desmoulins) arrested on 30 March 1794 and executed on 5 April 1794.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Danton, Georges Jacques\\". * Thermidorians: a group of Montagnards who conspired against Robespierre's regime and staged a coup d'√©tat on 27 July 1794 (9 Thermidor Year II), known as the Thermidorian Reaction, which overthrew Robespierre and saw him and his associates executed two days later.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"thermidor\\". As moderate republicans, the Thermidorians tried to calm down the Revolution and closed most Jacobin clubs across France.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Franse Revolutie. ¬ß1.3 Het Directoire. These events triggered the right-wing royalist and anti-revolutionary First White Terror, especially aimed against Montagnards and Jacobins in the Rh√¥ne valley and southern Brittany. However, a royalist coup d'√©tat on 13 Vend√©miaire (5 October 1795) was crushed by general Napoleon Bonaparte. With the Constitution of the Year III, the Thermidorians established the Directory as the executive power (replacing Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety) and replaced the National Convention by the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients, as the bicameral legislative power.Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Directoire [geschiedenis]\\".

Themes that the school has delt with include Neo-Marxism, Yugoslavism, psychoanalysis, Third wave feminism, Crisis theory, Post-Colonialism, Historical revisionism, Post- fascism, social constructionism, revolutionary democracy, linguistic nationalism and philosophy of existence. The school has a festival format and is organized once a year in December. It nurtures the traditions of the Praxis School ‚Äì a Yugoslav Marxist humanist philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by Western Marxism and organized the Korƒçula Summer School. The Open University of Sarajevo was an outspoken advocate of the 2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina social riots and called for the continuation of direct democracy that was established by plenums during and subsequently after the riots. The school runs a Free-to-view platform that streams all of its content online, dubbed in various languages, and archives it on its website and YouTube channel. The organizers negate the term school, preferring to use the term platform. History The Open University of Sarajevo was founded in 2011 by a select group of leftist professors from the University of Sarajevo in cooperation with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, the Crvena art and culture association, the Pantheon-Sorbonne University and the Krokodil Literary Festival. The initial group of founders included prof. Dr. Asim Mujkiƒá from the Faculty of Philosophy, prof. Dr. Enver Kazaz from the Comparative Literature Departement of the Faculty of Philosophy and prof. Dr. Dino Abazoviƒá from the Faculty of Political Sciences. Furthermore, the founding committee was joined by numerous other public intellectuals from the Former Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo-born writer and scholar Igor ≈†tiks, award-winning Bosnian film director Jasmila ≈Ωbaniƒá, Croatian linguist Snje≈æana Kordiƒá and others. The first edition of the school was held from 12 to 15 December 2011 in smaller venues, emulating the leftist caf√© tradition of the 1960s, before Nihad Kre≈°evljakoviƒá, the director of the Sarajevo War Theatre and grandson of Bosnian historian Hamdija Kre≈°evljakoviƒá indirectly joined the project and brought it to his theatre two years later. In 2013 the school established the Center for Interactive Education and Social Action (CODA) with the goal of improving democratic values and promoting social, economic and political participation and emancipation in Bosnian society. The 2015 edition was the first to include a wider multimedia program and a theatrical performance directed by Serbian experimental theatre director Bojan ƒêorƒëev titled Nije to crvena, to je krv (That's not red, that's blood). Format and venues The school is organized every December and lasts for four days. Each year's program is formed around a particular question such as What are we afraid of?, subsequently forming topics based on said statement (Why are we afraid of...Yugoslavism?; Why are we afraid of...Marxism?; Why are we afraid of...immigrants? etc.) Events and lectures are held in three venues, with the main stage being the Sarajevo War Theatre. The other two venues are the National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Each day's events are organized sequentially starting from the morning. The school follows an interactive and multimedia format with theatre plays, film projections, poetry readings and interactive games being held. The theatre segments often follow the form of Augusto Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed, and are directed by notable theatre directors from the Former Yugoslavia. Each day's activities are concluded in the Sarajevo War Theatre where the main round table discussions, lectures, panels and Q&A;'s are held. An evening symposium tops off the day. Another major aspect of the school's format is the fact that it does not require enrollment or any form of participant registration, instead opting for a grassroots and plenum format.

Their first record, Foghat (1973 album), was recorded in Rockfield Studios in South Wales and produced by Dave Edmunds. Foghat went on to headline arenas and record gold, platinum and multiplatinum albums, including their most successful, Fool for the City and Foghat Live. Two of their most successful chart singles were Slow Ride, produced by Nick Jameson, and Third Time Lucky, produced by Tony and Foghat. Tony also managed Felix Cavaliere, former lead singer of The Rascals. In 1998, Tony created PBS Records, a partnership label and joint venture between Warner Bros. Records, lead by Russ Thyret, and PBS Television. While President of PBS Records, the label produced TV specials with companion records with artists including Monica Mancini, as well as soundtracks to documentaries with Ken Burns, Louis Gates Jr., and Jennifer Fox (documentary filmmaker). = Personal life = Lives with his wife, Heather Creran, in Milton, GA and has a daughter, Amy Outeda.

History  The ruins were excavated when constructing the athletics and exercise area of in 1955. The name Kurihara was that of a small administrative unit of a village that existed in the area. In a survey conducted between 1955 and 1956, stone tools made of obsidian were excavated from the red soil (Kant≈ç Plain loam), and were found to be from the Paleolithic age. Also, J≈çmon pottery has been excavated, showing that traces of pit living from the Yayoi to the Heian periods (300 BC‚Äì1185 AD) have been found. The reconstructed dwelling depicts a construction from around the beginning of the 8th century, the early Nara period (AD 710 to 794). The reconstruction was designed by Gaijiro Fujishima, then a professor at the University of Tokyo, in 1957.  Structure  The remnants of the dwelling were dug down to a depth of 50 cm, and four pillar holes and a clay pot were identified to the north. When restoring the house, Japanese zelkova was used for the main pillar, and Japanese cedar was used for the beams and girders. The pit-house is surrounded by a metal fence and it is normally not possible to go inside.

Howe was arrested in 1880 and imprisoned for three years for fraud, but upon her release she repeated similar frauds until she was arrested again in 1888. Early life The details of Howe's early life are uncertain. Newspaper accounts gave inconsistent reports of her age, suggesting she may have been born as early as 1820 or as late as 1827. The Boston Herald claimed she was born in Providence, Rhode Island. A reported early marriage to a man named James Solomon may have been annulled due to miscegenation, followed by a marriage to a second man who subsequently died. Many of these details came from sources hostile to Howe and are difficult to confirm. In 1852, she married Florimund L. Howe in Manchester, New Hampshire. After the American Civil War, the couple moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where she worked as a fortune teller and in various other occupations, some of them criminal. She spent several weeks in jail in 1875 after taking out multiple loans secured with the same collateral, but her conviction was overturned on appeal. Ladies' Deposit Howe opened the Ladies' Deposit Company sometime before April 1879 as a savings bank that accepted deposits only from unmarried women. She told depositors that the bank worked with a Quaker charity that wanted to help women of modest means. She promised a very high interest rate on the deposits, initially described as two percent per week, which was later adjusted to eight percent per month. In fact there was no such charity and Howe relied on new deposits to pay the interest on older ones. Howe did not advertise the bank, but was able to attract $500,000 in deposits from about 1200 women in cities as far away as Chicago and Washington by relying on referrals from her depositors. In September 1880, the Boston Daily Advertiser began publishing articles attacking the Ladies' Deposit as a swindle, which led to a run on the bank by its depositors. By October the scheme had collapsed and Howe was charged with multiple counts of fraud. She was convicted and served three years in prison. Later life After her release in 1884, Howe set up another fraudulent bank, the Women's Bank. The new bank operated on the same principles as the Ladies' Deposit, but promised a slightly lower interest rate of seven percent per month. She accepted an estimated $50,000 in deposits before the new fraud was exposed in April 1887. Howe fled Boston before she could be indicted. Howe attempted similar schemes in other cities, including one in Chicago under the name Ladies Provident Aid. She returned to Boston where she was arrested in December 1888, but she was released in March 1889 because victims were unwilling to participate in her prosecution. She returned to fortune telling until her death in Boston on January 26, 1892.

The many varieties of shijie range from deceitful cases, such as a person feigning death by substituting the corpse of their recently deceased grandfather as their own, to supernatural cases, such as (jianjie ÂäçËß£, \\"sword liberation\\") using a waidan alchemical sword to temporarily create a corpse-simulacrum, which enables one to escape and assume a new identity. Terminology =Shijie= The Chinese term shƒ´jiƒõ compounds the words shƒ´ (Â∞∏ or Â±ç, \\"corpse; body\\") and jiƒõ (Ëß£, \\"separate; divide; cut apart\\"), and has been described as a \\"rather strange name\\" (Seidel 1987: 230), \\"notoriously slippery term\\" (Benn 2003: 139), with \\"the potential for confusion\\" (Campany 2002: 53), and sometimes \\"misrepresented or interpreted in a way too vague to be intelligible\\" (Pas 1998: 57). Shƒ´ (Â∞∏) has three sets of English translation equivalents in Paul W. Kroll's dictionary of Classical Chinese and Medieval Chinese: #person serving as a surrogate for the deceased in a sacrificial ceremony, the impersonator ... memorial tablet #corpse, lich; cadaver ... lay out a corpse; expose a corpse #be in charge of, have the care or supervision of ... occupy a position without performing the duties attached to it (2017: 410‚Äì411) Shi's first equivalent of the ceremonial personator who was a stand- in for a deceased relative (\\"corpse\\") during Chinese funeral rituals and ancestral rites is a semantic extension of the basic meaning \\"corpse\\" (Carr 2007). Campany describes the shi \\"impersonator of deceased ancestors, one who sat in their place during the solemn presentation of food, drink, and announcements and the performance of dances\\" (2002: 53). Besides the usual meaning of \\"corpse, dead body\\", shi Â∞∏ can sometimes mean \\"body, mortal body\\"‚Äîparticularly in shijie contexts. Joseph Needham translates shijie as \\"release from the mortal part\\" (1974: 297), which is more appropriate than \\"release from the corpse\\" because the first step in achieving shijie transcendence is to abandon one's corporeal body (Pregadio 2004: 117). Anna Seidel points out that shi in the term shijie denotes \\"all the corruptible aging factors of the physical body,\\" rather than the corpse itself (1987: 230). Fabrizio Pregadio cites a classic Daoist text that clearly uses the word shi to denote \\"not specifically a corpse, but in general the 'mortal body', either living or dead\\". A passage in the c. 200 CE Xiang'er commentary to the Daodejing (see below) contrasts shisi (Â∞∏Ê≠ª) and shisheng (Â∞∏Áîü), which cannot be read literally to mean \\"a corpse dies\\" and \\"a corpse lives\\". \\"When the mortal body dies (shisi), that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives (shisheng), that is accomplishment\\"; this context refers to options for a living person, and not to a postmortem renewal; \\"its subject, in other words, is not the 'corpse' but the 'mortal body'\\" (2004: 116‚Äì117). However, Campany contends that what is escaped through shijie is not the adept's shi dead body but the administrative system of death registration (2002: 53). Owing to the ambiguities of reading the original Chinese character Â∞∏ for shi \\"corpse; mortal body; personator of the dead; etc.\\", the basic meaning of \\"corpse\\" is clarified with the character shi Â±ç that adds si (Ê≠ª, \\"die; death\\") to shi Â∞∏. Compare the word s«êshƒ´ (Ê≠ªÂ±ç, lit. \\"dead corpse\\") meaning \\"corpse; dead body\\". Jie (Ëß£) has seven sets of English translation equivalents in Kroll's dictionary: #untie, unknot, loosen, release ... doff, take off #disjoint, dismember ... dissect; analyze, take apart # remove, eliminate ... resolve; (find a) solution, work out (a problem) # deliver from, release, liberate, free oneself from; emancipate # dissipate, dissolve; disperse; dispel # open out; unfurl, unfold; reveal # explain, expound; exposition ... (2017: 210) Kroll gives shijie as a usage example under both shi 2. and jie 4., glossed as \\"'deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse,' in which the adept's supposed corpse is buried but is actually substituted with a personal object (sword, staff, etc.) that temporarily takes on the appearance of the corpse, thus allowing one to escape from the bureaucracy of death; a lower-level means of transcendence.\\" Scholars propose divergent semantic interpretations of the jie in shijie: \\"to molt,\\" \\"to quarter,\\" \\"to expel an affliction\\" (Robinet 1979: 58); \\"to divide, separate, disperse, to detach, deliver\\", \\"to loosen, dissolve, explain\\", and \\"emancipation, liberation\\" in Chinese Buddhism (Pas 1998: 58); and \\"release, deliverance, escape\\" (Campany 2002: 53). The ancient shijie is related with the medical term shƒ´t«ê jiƒõpu (Â±çÈ´îËß£Ââñ, \\"autopsy; postmortem examination\\") that combines shƒ´t«ê (Â±çÈ´î, \\"corpse; remains\\") with jiƒõp≈çu (Ëß£Ââñ, \\"dissect\\"). =Varieties= The forms of shijie are quite diverse, in its broadest meaning, the term sometimes simply denotes disappearance, \\"to depart on a journey through foreign lands.\\" It more commonly designates a type of disappearance that leaves a trace behind, such as a body without its bones, or a coffin that contains only a symbolic staff, sword, or sandal. Sometimes shijie can even refer to an adept who comes back to life after apparent death (Robinet 1979: 58‚Äì59). The French sinologist Isabelle Robinet compares the common forms of shijie. *Jianjie (ÂäçËß£, \\"deliverance by a sword\\") is considered the most noble shijie method. This technique requires either an inferior \\"simple sword\\" or a divine \\"magical sword\\" that enables one \\"to return to your old village under another name\\" since the subterranean officials no longer have any hold on those who have performed it. *Bingjie (ÂÖµËß£, \\"deliverance by a military weapon\\" or \\"escape by execution\\") is the liberation of those who have been executed, such as the famous Zuo Ci (155‚Äì220) who continued to be seen alive in Jingzhou despite the fact that Cao Cao was in possession of his head and the rest of his body had disappeared. *Wenjie (ÊñáËß£, \\"peaceful deliverance\\"), which contrasts with bingjie, involves replacing the body with sandals or a staff. Maxime Kaltenmark showed that Daoist magical sandals are birds, which enable the adept to soar aloft and fly away, similar with jianjie. *Shuijie (Ê∞¥Ëß£, \\"deliverance by water\\") is when the body of a drowned person is protected by a compassionate divinity, \\"On the outside it is said that he drowned; on the inside, in truth, he is secretly saved.\\" *Huojie (ÁÅ´Ëß£, \\"deliverance by fire\\") involves a Daoist who is burned alive and apparently flies away in the form of a bird. In certain cases, the adept's body undergoes spontaneous human combustion, such as Cai Jing (Ëî°Á∂ì), whose body burned for three days until his bones dissolved and \\"only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell\\" (1979: 60‚Äì62). Another variation is zhangjie (ÊùñËß£, \\"staff-liberated)\\", when the adept's bamboo staff served as a temporary stand-in for his real body, which was transformed and vanished away to the realm of the immortals (Strickmann 1979: 130). =Related terms= Shijie is similar to the word bianhua (\\"transformation; metamorphosis\\") and its synonymous components bian (ËÆä, \\"change; alter\\") and hua (Âåñ, \\"change; transform\\"). For instance, the 499 Zhen'gao refers to a superior method of shijie called huadun (ÂåñÈÅÅ, \\"to transform and escape\\"), and mentions tuohua dunbian (Ë®óÂåñÈÅÅËÆä, \\"to simulate transformation and hide by metamorphosis\\"); and the 983 Taiping Yulan describes shijie dunbian (Â∞∏Ëß£ÈÅÅËÆä, \\"delivered from the body and transformed by escaping\\") (Robinet 1979: 57). All types of bianhua require a material support, and shijie generally involves \\"going away by making use of a material object.\\" However, there is an essential difference between them. Bianhua is a magical trick or the manipulation of a power that the mystic can use while alive; Shijie is only practiced at the end of life and is a form of deliverance linked with the purification and refinement of the body (Robinet 1993: 168). He Xiangu flying on a crane; painting by Zhang Lu (1464‚Äì1538) The hu√† (Âåñ, \\"change; transform; convert\\") in bianhua occurs in several Daoist alternative terms for shijie. Jiƒõhu√† (Ëß£Âåñ, with the jie \\"release; etc.\\" in shijie) means \\"liberate the mortal body and attain the Dao\\". XiƒÅohu√† (Èä∑Âåñ, with \\"melt away; disintegrate\\") means \\"release the physical body and transform into a xian\\" (see the Shiji below). Y«îhu√† (ÁæΩÂåñ, with \\"feather; wing\\") refers to an insect \\"growing wings; eclosion\\", which Daoists semantically extended to \\"die and become a xian flying up to heaven\\"; wings are a common feature in depictions of xian, either riding a mythological flying creature or flying with their own wings‚Äîcompare y«îr√©n (ÁæΩ‰∫∫, with \\"person\\") \\"xian transcendent/immortal; Daoist priest\\". As detailed in \\"Early textual usages\\" below, the term xingjie (ÂΩ¢Ëß£, \\"release of the form\\"), with x√≠ng (ÂΩ¢, \\"outward form, appearance, shape; figure, configuration; structure, contour, outline\\", Kroll 2007: 509), was a near synonym of shijie (\\"release from the corpse\\") that was recorded several centuries earlier. Tu≈çs«ê (Ë®óÊ≠ª, \\"feign death; simulate death\\", later written ÊâòÊ≠ª) frequently occurs in shijie contexts. Compare the Chinese Buddhist term tu≈çshƒìng (ÊâòÁîü, \\"be reincarnated\\") that was also used in early Daoist texts. Translations The term shijie has been \\"variously and often poorly translated\\" (Robinet 1979: 58). Translational difficulty stems from shi \\"corpse\\", and the term is usually rendered \\"liberation or deliverance from the corpse\\". However, Kirkland points out that in most accounts of shijie the subject did not actually die, and although all the appearances of death were involved, no corpse was really left behind (2008: 897). English translations include: *\\"deliverance of the corpse\\" (Needham and Wang 1954) *\\"corpse-freed\\", \\"release as a corpse\\" (Ware 1966) *\\"corpse-free\\", \\"liberation from the corpse\\", \\"release from the mortal part\\" (Needham and Lu 1974) *\\"deliverance from the corpse\\" (Robinet 1979, Kohn 1993) *\\"liberation by means of a corpse\\" (Strickmann 1979) *\\"liberation from the corpse\\" (Strickmann 1979, Campany 1996) *\\"release from the corpse\\" (Pregadio 2004) *\\"liberation from the corpse\\" (Campany 1996) *\\"body liberation\\" (Pas 1998) *\\"escape by means of a simulated corpse\\" (Campany 2002, Smith 2013) *\\"release by means of a corpse\\", \\"mortuary liberation\\" (Kirkland 2008) *\\"deliverance by means of a [simulated] corpse\\" (Kroll 2017) *\\"release from the mortal body\\" (Pregadio 2018) Within this sample, shi is usually translated as \\"corpse\\", and jie most commonly as \\"liberation\\" or \\"release\\". Early textual usages The word shijie (\\"release from/of the corpse\\") is first recorded in the c. 80 CE Lunheng below, but its near synonym xingjie (ÂΩ¢Ëß£, \\"release from the form\\") occurs in earlier texts dating from around the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE. They do not use xingjie to denote a specific Daoist practice or method, but as general ways of transcending one's limited individuality (Pregadio 2004: 116). While shijie and xingjie are both instances of transcending the mortal body, they are not exactly the same, \\"release from the corpse\\" requires undergoing death but \\"release from the form\\" does not (Pregadio 2004: 117). =Zhuangzi= First, xingjie \\"release from the form\\" refers to a spiritual epiphany in the c. 3rd‚Äì2nd century BCE Zhuangzi story about Tian Zifang (Áî∞Â≠êÊñπ, Sir Square Field) praising his teacher Dongguo Xunzi (Êù±ÈÉ≠È†ÜÂ≠ê, Sir Accord of Easturb) to the Marquess Wen of Wei (r. 446‚Äì397 BCE) (Pregadio 2004: 115). > After Sir Square went out, Marquis Wen spent the rest of the day in a state > of dumb uncertainty. Then he summoned before him the officials who were > standing on duty and said to them, \\"How far we are from the gentleman of > complete integrity. At first I considered the words of the sages and the > wise men, the practice of humaneness and righteousness to be the ultimate. > But now that I have heard about Sir Square's teacher, my physical form is > unstrung and I have no desire to move [ÂêæÂΩ¢Ëß£ËÄå‰∏çÊ¨≤Âãï]; my mouth is clamped shut > and I have no desire to speak. What I have emulated is only an earthen > image, and the state of Wei has truly been an encumbrance to me.\\" (tr. Mair > 1994: 199) =Shiwen= Second, the term xingjie (ÂΩ¢Ëß£, \\"release of the form\\") describes an advanced self-cultivation exercise in the \\"Shiwen\\" (ÂçÅÂïè, Ten Questions), a previously-unknown medical book within the c. 200‚Äì168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts that archeologists discovered in a Western Han tomb (Pas 1998: 58). The fourth of the Shiwen's ten dialogues (MSVI.A.4) is between the mythical Yellow Emperor and Rong Cheng (ÂÆπÊàê), a legendary ancient master of Daoist sexual practices and Daoyin breath circulation techniques, who says, > Longevity is born of growth and accumulation. As for the fullness of that > life: above it scans heaven and below it spreads over earth. The person who > is capable of it invariably becomes a spirit. Thus he is capable of > achieving release of the form. The person who perceives the great way skims > the clouds as he moves. ‚Ä¶ like water flowing he can range far; like the > dragon ascending he can rise high. (tr. Harper 1998: 390). This is the only Shiwen passage that reflects the likely influence of xian or \\"syncretistic-Daoist\\" ideas about transcendence/immortality in the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan bamboo medical texts, which primarily discuss maintaining health and attaining longevity. Harper notes that xingjie \\"release from the form\\" is thought to be synonymous with shijie \\"release from the corpse\\", which for the Daoist believer, marked the moment of xian transformation when a new, immortal physique was perfected and the mortal body sloughed off, leaving behind a husk-like corpse (or an object such as a sword or staff) as evidence that the adept had achieved shijie (citing Maspero 1981: 445‚Äì48). However, it is evident that xingjie in this Shiwen context, with references to \\"becoming a spirit\\" above and rising \\"like the dragon\\", does not represent the concepts of shijie in religious Daoism (Harper 1998: 114, 124). =Shiji= Third, xingjie names a supernatural technique in Sima Qian's c. 94 BCE Shiji (Records of the Historian) passage denouncing the practices performed by some fangshi (\\"masters of the methods\\") from the state of Yan who arrived at the First Emperor of Qin's court. These masters \\"practiced methods for immortality [ÂÉäÈÅì] and for the release from the form through dissolution and transformation [ÂΩ¢Ëß£Èä∑Âåñ], relying on services offered to gods and demons.\\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 115). The Shiji commentary cites Fu Qian ÊúçËôî (c. 125-c. 195 CE), who glosses xingjie (ÂΩ¢Ëß£) as shijie (Â∞∏Ëß£). The abtruse meaning of this phrase xingjie xiaohua (ÂΩ¢Ëß£Èä∑Âåñ) is illustrated in other translations: *\\"deliverance from the body which is dissolved and transformed\\" (Robinet 1979: 57) *\\"release of the form and fluxing transformation\\" (Harper 1998: 114) *\\"shed their mortal forms and melted away\\" (Kirkland 2008: 896) Based upon this term xiao (Èä∑, \\"melt [esp. metal]; dissolve\\"), some scholars (e.g., Robinet 1979: 66) believe xiaohua alludes to waidan External Alchemy practices, but Pregadio disagrees and says it refers to \\"thaumaturgic methods for replicating and multiplying one's form (ubiquity), or for dissolving it and hiding it (invisibility)\\" (2004: 115). =Lunheng= A cicada nymph molting its exoskeleton and transforming into a winged adult. The iconoclastic philosopher Wang Chong's c. 80 CE Lunheng (Balanced Inquiries) has earliest known occurrences of the term shijie \\"separation from the body\\" (tr. Alfred Forke). The Daoxu (ÈÅìËôõ, Daoist Untruths) chapter uses shijie six times in a passage refuting the legend that Li Shaojun, a Daoist fangshi the court of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87), was several hundred years old when he died. > The ordinary students of Tao have not Li Shao Ch√ºn‚Äôs age. Before reaching a > hundred years they die like all the others. Yet uncultured and ignorant > people still hold that they are separated from their bodies, and vanish, and > that, as a matter of fact, they do not die. What is understood by separation > from the body? Does it mean that the body dies, and the spirit disappears? > Or that the body does not die, but drops its coil? If one says that the body > dies, and the spirit is lost, there is no difference from death, and every > one is a genius. And if one believes that the body does not die, but throws > off its coil, one must admit that the bones and the flesh of all the > deceased Taoists are intact and in no wise different from the corpses of > ordinary mortals. When the cricket leaves its chrysalis, the tortoise drops > its shell, the snake its skin, and the stag its horns, in short, when the > horned and skinned animals lose their outward cover, retaining only their > flesh and bones, one might speak of the separation from the body. But even > if the body of a dead Taoist were similar to a chrysalis, one could not use > this expression, because, when the cricket leaves the chrysalis, it cannot > be considered as a spirit with regard to the chrysalis. Now to call it a > separation from the body, when there is not even a similarity with the > chrysalis, would again be an unfounded assertion missing the truth. The > Grand Annalist [i.e., Sima Qian, the Shiji compiler] was a contemporary of > Li Shao Ch√ºn. Although he was not amongst those who came near to Li Shao > Ch√ºn‚Äôs body, when he had expired, he was in a position to learn the truth. > If he really did not die, but only parted with his body, the Grand Annalist > ought to have put it on record, and would not have given the place of his > death. (tr. Forke 1907: 345‚Äì346) Wang Chong explains the shijie process with the ch√°n (Ëü¨, \\"cicada\\") analogy of a nymph molting its exoskeleton, converting into an adult, and leaving behind its exuviae; the adept transforms the body and joins with the spirit into physical immortality, leaving behind some external object in the coffin to prove that the corpse disappeared (Pas 1998: 60). Forke also translates \\"separation from the body\\" for lixing (Èõ¢ÂΩ¢, \\"separate from the form\\") in another Lunheng chapter, Siwei (Ê≠ªÂÅΩ, False Reports About the Dead). \\"The souls of the dead are dissolved, and cannot hear any more what men say. This inability to hear what others say is called death. If after their separation from the body they became ghosts, and kept near to men, their connection with the body would already have been severed, and, though people addressed them, it would be impossible for them to again enter the body. and close the eyes, or open the mouth.\\" (1907: 207). =Xiang'er Daodejing commentary= The c. 190‚Äì200 CE Xiang'er commentary to the Daodejing, which is central to the Daoist Way of the Celestial Masters religious tradition, uses shi to mean not specifically a \\"corpse\\" but generally a \\"mortal body\\", either living or dead (Pregadio 2004: 116). The Xiang'er commentary uses the uncommon terms shisi (Â∞∏Ê≠ª, \\"a corpse dies\\") and shisheng (Â∞∏Áîü, \\"a corpse lives\\") to explain the last line in Daodejing Chapter 15, \\"Through this lack of fullness, they are able to disintegrate and be renewed\\" [ËÉΩËæ≠Âæ©Êàê]\\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 117). Bokenkamp interprets shisheng literally, \\"When the corpse perishes, that is disintegration; when it lives, that is \\"renewal\\" [Â∞∏Ê≠ªÁÇ∫ÂºäÂ∞∏ÁîüÁÇ∫Êàê]. Only by holding to the Dao without allowing one's will to overflow is one able to transform disintegration into renewal.\\" (1997: 100). Pregadio translates shi as \\"mortal body\\", \\"When the mortal body dies, that is wearing out; when the mortal body lives, that is accomplishment. Only by guarding the Dao without being full and overflowing is one able to transform wearing out into accomplishment.\\" (2004: 117); noting that the passage refers to options given to a living person for their \\"mortal body\\", and not to a postmortem renewal for their \\"corpse\\". The commentary to two Daodejing chapters describe an early Daoist understanding of transcendence. The adept tu≈çs«ê (Ë®óÊ≠ª, \\"feigns/simulates death\\") and goes to the T√†iyƒ´n (Â§™Èô∞, Palace of Great Darkness, in the extreme north of the heavens), where their bodily form is refined, in analogy with alchemically refining base metals, resulting in fusheng (Âæ©Áîü, \\"rebirth\\" or \\"second birth\\") in a body that preserves itself indefinitely (Pregadio 2018: 387). On the other hand, the damned are consigned to d√¨guƒÅn (Âú∞ÂÆò, Earth Office), equated with the Diyu (Âú∞ÁçÑ, \\"earth prisons; purgatories\\") of later texts. While the Celestial Masters recognized that death was inevitable, they sought longevity not through extended life in this world, but through the avoidance of death, described in terms of \\"feigned death\\" and continued existence in the next life (Bokenkamp 1997: 47). Daodejing Chapter 33 ends with the baffling phrase \\"Those who die without perishing are longevous [Ê≠ªËÄå‰∏ç‰∫°ËÄÖÂ£Ω]\\", which the Xiang'er commentary explains. > When a Daoist's practices are complete, the spirits of the Dao call that > person to return. Departing the world through feigned death [ÈÅøÂéªË®óÊ≠ª], the > person passes through Grand Darkness to be born again and not perish. That > is longevity. Commoners have no good merits, and when they die, they belong > to the Earth Office. That is to perish. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 135) Compare Seidel 's translation, \\"When he retires from the world, he simulates death and passes over to the realm of the Extreme Yin (Taiyin)\\" (1987: 230). For the Chapter 16 passage \\"Their bodies obliterated, they do not perish [Ê≤íË∫´‰∏çÊÆÜ]\\", the commentary says: > Grand Darkness is the palace where those who have accumulated the Dao refine > their forms [ÁÖâÂΩ¢]. When there is no place for them to stay in the world, the > worthy withdraw and, feigning death [ÈÅøÂéªË®óÊ≠ª], pass through Grand Darkness to > have their images reborn on the other side. This is to be \\"obliterated > without perishing.\\" The profane are unable to accumulate good deeds, so when > they die it is truly death. They are taken away in service of the Earth > Offices. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: 102) Pregadio specifically translates lianxing (ÁÖâÂΩ¢) as \\"refine their [bodily] forms\\", and says, \\"Since the release from, or rather of, the mortal body is a necessary step to continue one‚Äôs cultivation, the refining process takes place after one who is ready for it has \\"simulated death\\". Leaving one's mortal body and refining one's form results, at first, in entering again into a state in which neither form nor matter exist, but only a xiang (Ë±°, image, appearance). After the adept's bodily form has been refined, the process culminates in his \\"rebirth\\".\\" (2018: 387). The Xiang'er commentary refers to those who lose faith in the Dao as x√≠ngshƒ´ (Ë°åÂ∞∏, \\"mobile corpses\\"). While received texts of Chapter 7 have \\"Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end that all his personal ends are fulfilled?\\" (tr. Watson, Èùû‰ª•ÂÖ∂ÁÑ°ÁßÅËÄ∂ÊïÖËÉΩÊàêÂÖ∂ÁßÅ), the commentary has shi (Â∞∏, \\"corpse\\") instead of si (ÁßÅ, \\"self-interest; selfish concerns\\"), thus, \\"Because he is without a corpse, he is able to perfect his [mortal] corpse.\\" > The bodies of those who do not know the Dao of long life are but mobile > corpses. It is not the Dao that they practice, but merely the way of the > corpses. The reason the people of the Dao are able to achieve the longevity > of Transcendents is that they do not practice the way of the corpses. They > differ from the vulgar and thus are able to perfect their corpses, allowing > them to enter the ranks of the Transcendent nobility. (tr. Bokenkamp 1997: > 85) =Liexian zhuan= Beginning with the c. 2nd century CE Liexian Zhuan (Biographies of Exemplary Immortals), numerous hagiographies of Daoist masters directly or indirectly mentioned them transcending death through shijie. While many religious traditions maintain that a believer can ascend to heaven and leave behind a body, Daoist accounts of shijie are notable for denying that a real corpse was left behind (Kirkland 2008: 896). Several Liexian zhuan hagiographies mention discovering wushi (ÁÑ°Â±ç, \\"corpseless\\") coffins, implying that the adept had used shijie, but only one directly refers to shijie (Â±çËß£). Kou Xian (ÂØáÂÖà) was a legendary fisherman in the Zhou dynasty state of Song who lived on the banks of the Sui River (Áù¢Ê∞¥) for over a century. Duke Jing (ÊôØÂÖ¨) of Song (r. 516-451) asked Kou to teach the Dao of longevity, but he refused and the duke had him executed. Several decades later Kou Xian was seen playing a qin lute by the Song city gate, revealing that he evaded death by means of shijie. In later texts, this was interpreted as bingjie (ÂÖµËß£, \\"escape by execution\\") (Campany 2009: 125). =Taiqing texts= The Taiqing (Â§™Ê∏Ö, Great Clarity) school of Daoism, which preceded the better-known Shangqing School (Highest Clarity), devised new shijie methods using documents to game the spirit-administration system that regulates and enforces human lifespans. In contrast to the Jewish and Christian beliefs that God records the name of every person in the Book of Life and Book of Death, the Chinese believed that the otherworldly death ledger system operated like the imperial system of census family registration, with scribes keeping track of people by their names and registered places of residence. Two exemplary Taiqing scriptures, both mentioned in the c. 320 Baopuzi below, describe novel shijie procedures: placing a brief listing one's own name and registration data onto one's grandfather's corpse during the funeral, and creating a Daoist fu (Á¨¶, supernatural talisman) asserting the cause of death was illness (Campany 2002: 57). Both shijie procedures require that the adept and substitute corpse have similar surnames and home districts. First, the \\"Taiqing yinye shenqi jing\\" (Â§™Ê∏ÖÈáëÊ∂≤Á•ûÊ∞£Á∂ì, Grand Purity Scripture of the Divine Pneumas of Potable Gold') quotes the mythical Yellow Thearch's instructions for preparing a legalistic brief and incantation in order to falsify the life and death ledger system. > \\"The Sovereign of Humanity (‰∫∫Áöá) is familiar with all the registers of the > living and the dead (Ê≠ªÁîü‰πãÈåÑ). He knows the names of the hundred ghosts and he > records the surnames and bynames of the myriad spirits. If you seek a method > of extending your years and increasing your longevity, you should prepare a > brief (Áñè) to the Sovereign of Humanity, fully listing your own surname and > given name, the year, month, and day of your birth anniversary, and the > province, commandery, district, hamlet, village, sector, and earth-god > shrine under whose jurisdiction you [are registered as] residing. Then, at > the funeral of your grandfather, place this brief in the tomb and incant (Á•ù) > as follows: 'Whatever is born must die; allotted life span should accord > with the registers. My name was not recorded in the Great Dark Storehouse > (Â§ßÂπΩËóè), yet now I am already set to rest in Haoli. Roaming in the infernal > realms, I wail over this in eternal vexation.' Having completed [this > incantation], return home. In addition, you must change your surname and > byname; these must not be the same as before. Thereupon you will not die in > a thousand autumns or a myriad years; for the ledgers have already been > fixed, and your name has forever been expunged.\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 53‚Äì54) The Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding, with graphic components of b√¨ngs«ê (ÁóÖÊ≠ª, died of illness), shi (Â∞∏, corpse), and gui (È¨º, ghost). Second, the Lingbao wufu xu (ÈùàÂØ∂‰∫îÁ¨¶Â∫è, Explanations on the Five Numinous Treasure Talismans) promises earthbound transcendence to those who follow a complex procedure involving a poisonous alchemical elixir, a mystical Daoist talisman, death meditation (cf. Buddhist Mara·πáasati), and a shijie simulated corpse. The text gives instructions for compounding and ingesting a mercury-based elixir called shijie yao (Â∞∏Ëß£Ëó•, shijie drug), and writing out in red characters (as for an imperial edict) the Numinous Treasure Talisman of the Grand Mystery for Living in Hiding (ÈùàÂØ∂Â§™ÁéÑÈô∞Áîü‰πãÁ¨¶), which includes stylized Chinese calligraphy for bingsi (ÁóÖÊ≠ª, died of illness), shi (Â∞∏, corpse), and gui (È¨º, ghost). > After you have ingested the Medicine for the Release from the Mortal Body > for the prescribed number of days, write the talisman [of the Highest > Mystery of Living Unseen] in red on white silk, and place it on your belly. > On a wu or ji day [in the sexagenary cycle], lie down, your head pointing > towards the west, and visualize yourself being dead [ÊÄùÂøµËá™‰ΩúÊ≠ª‰∫∫]. After quite > some time, take off your clothes, leave them where you have lain, and head > straight to enter the mountains. When you are far away, change your name. > Never return to your hometown. Right after you have left, people will find > that where you had lain there is a corpse. But suddenly, after a while, no > one will know where your corpse is to be found. (tr. Pregadio 2018: 390) This Taiqing account shows that shijie \\"release from the mortal body\\" requires memento mori-like meditation practices and ritual aspects. The adept literally \\"stages\\" his or her death, and the \\"audience\\" of family members or Daoist companions participate in the \\"performance\\". They state that the corpse disappeared and was replaced by another object, such as a sword or staff. This shijie object performs the same function as played by the tishen (ÊõøË∫´, \\"replacement bodies\\") in early funerary rites. In a ritual sense, the object replaces the deceased, whether the adept's death is real or only \\"simulated\\" (Pregadio 2018: 390‚Äì391). The same scripture also describes how to make male and female versions of a talisman for \\"masters of the Dao who wish to perform shijie\\", which when written with a \\"spirit-brush\\" (Á•ûÁ≠Ü) on any wood or metal object will immediately transform it into a substitute cadaver that will subsequently \\"die and depart\\" (Campany 2002: 54). Comparing the two documentary shijie procedures, Campany finds common elements. Both involve a ritual performance (an incantation protesting one's untimely death, meditating on oneself as a corpse). Each uses an administrative document to magically activate an object (one's grandfather's corpse, one's discarded clothing) that creates an illusory substitute corpse. Both mandate a complete name change. The usual interpretation for a practitioner who performs shijie to change their name is as a simple trick to elude the spirits enforcing the \\"registers of life and death\\" for each person's lifespan; the adept changes their name in the belief that the spirit-bureaucrats would be unable to locate them and cause their death. On a deeper level, Pregadio notes the homophonous correspondence between g«éim√≠ng (ÊîπÂêç, changing name) and g«éim√¨ng (ÊîπÂëΩ, changing destiny), and says the change of name does not merely intend to cheat the spirits, but is symbolically equivalent to the meditational and ritual act of \\"taking off one's clothes\\", that is, discarding one's old persona (Pregadio 2018: 391). =Baopuzi= The Daoist scholar Ge Hong's c. 320 Baopuzi (Master who Embraces Simplicity) reflects contemporary understanding of shijie during the Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420). Two \\"Inner Chapters\\" mention shijie, and Ge's appended \\"Daoist Library\\" records the Shijie jing (Â∞∏Ëß£Á∂ì, Classic of Shijie), which is no longer extant (Ware 1966: 382). One passage about the 2nd century BCE fangshi Li Shaojun (ÊùéÂ∞ëÂêõ, mentioned in the Lunheng above) lists shijie as the lowest category of xian transcendents after tian (heavenly) and di (earthly). > The manuals of the immortals say that masters of the highest category are > able to raise themselves high up into the aery void; these are called > 'celestial immortals' [tianxian Â§©‰ªô]. Those of the second category resort to > the famous mountains (and forests) and are called 'terrestrial immortals' > [dixian Âú∞‰ªô]. As for those of the third category they simply slough off the > body after death, and they are called 'corpse-free immortals' [shijiexian > Â∞∏Ëß£‰ªô]. (2, tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 106, adapted from Ware 1966: 47, \\"Corpse- > freed Genii\\") Based on Han dynasty sources, Ge Hong concludes that Li Shaojun must have been a shijiexian because long after his death from illness, Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87) had the coffin opened, and it was found to contain \\"only a gown and hat\\". Ge gives three other Eastern Han (25‚Äì220 CE) adepts who were shijie transcendents. Xie Yuanyi (Ë¨ùÂÖÉ‰∏Ä) took Fei Changfang (Ë≤ªÈï∑Êàø) away and left \\"a bamboo effigy to be buried in his place\\"; Li Yiqi (ÊùéÊÑèÊúü) and two disciples \\"died\\" in Pixian, but when their families opened their coffins they found in each \\"a bamboo staff with red writing on it\\" (tr. Ware 1966: 47‚Äì48). In another Baopuzi passage, Ge Hong denounced as a charlatan the healer Li Kuan (ÊùéÂØ¨), who treated illnesses with holy water and amulets and became extremely popular in south China. Ge's personal acquaintances who had witnessed Li's healing rituals, using \\"very shallow\\" recipes, unanimously said he was frail, senile, and no different from ordinary old people. After Li Kuan died from a virulent plague, his followers repeatedly claimed that he had metamorphosed into a xian transcendent through \\"release as a corpse and that his was not a true death\\". Ge concluded that Li's death proved he was \\"not the right type of individual\\" to become a shijiexian (tr. Ware 1966: 159‚Äì160). In the Baopuzi, Ge Hong considered processes like shijie to be perfectly natural. > When gold and jade are inserted into the nine orifices, corpses do not > decay. When salt and brine are absorbed into flesh and marrow, dried meats > do not spoil. So when men ingest substances which are able to benefit their > bodies and lengthen their days, why should it be strange that (some of > these) should confer life perpetual? (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 284, adapted > from Ware 1966: 62) During Zhou dynasty funerals, amulets of jade, beads or cicadas, were placed in the mouth of the dead (Needham et al. 1976: 3). =Shenxian zhuan= Besides the Baopuzi, Ge Hong also compiled the Shenxian Zhuan (Biographies of Divine Transcendents) that provides more information about shijie than the earlier Liexian Zhuan above. Five hagiographies of xian directly mention shijie and many others allude to it with finding empty coffins, such as Ling Shouguang (ÈùàÂ£ΩÂÖâ). > Ling Shouguang was a native of Fufeng. At the age of over seventy obtained a > method for [making] \\"efflorescence of vermilion\\" pills. These he synthesized > and ingested, with the result that his appearance was that of a person in > his twenties. By the first year of the [Latter] Han jian'an period [196 CE] > he was already two hundred twenty years old. Later, without having shown any > signs of illness, he \\"died\\" at the home of Hu Gang (ËÉ°Â≤°) in Jiangling. Over a > hundred days after his funeral and burial, someone saw Ling in Xiaohuang. > This person sent a letter to Hu Gang, who, upon receiving the letter, dug up > the coffin and looked inside. It was empty except for an old shoe. (tr. > Campany 2002: 232) Wang Yuan's (ÁéãÈÅ†) hagiography has a rare description of how the shijie process feels. Wang explains to his pupil Cai Jing (Ëî°Á∂ì): > \\"By birth, you are destined to transcend the world; you will be chosen as a > replacement for an office. But your knowledge of the Way is scant; your > pneumas are few and you have much flesh. You cannot ascend [directly] in > this condition, but must avail yourself of shijie. It's like passing out > through a dog's hole [too narrow to permit a person easy passage], that's > all.\\" Then Wang declared to Cai the essential teachings, and left him. Soon > Cai felt his entire body grow hot as if on fire. He craved cold water to > bathe himself in; his entire family brought water and poured it over him, > and it was like making steam by pouring water over hot rocks. This went on > for three days. Then, once his bones had completely dissolved, he stood up, > went into his room, and covered himself with a blanket. Suddenly he had > vanished. When his family looked inside the blanket, only his outer skin was > left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell. (tr. Campany 2002: 260) Cai Jing's shijie is not merely escape by means of a simulated corpse that leaves behind the adept's possession (shoe, staff, etc.) but a transformative refinement that dissolves their bones (believed to be the seat of lifespan allotment) and leaves behind only their skin. Thus, Campany suggests translating Cai Jing's case as \\"'release from one's corpse', where the 'corpse' is all the dross of one's own former, impure body, refined away to leave one with a newly incorruptible body\\" (2002: 266). The hagiography of Yin Changsheng (Èô∞Èï∑Áîü), who supposedly lived over three hundred years, estimates the frequency of adepts achieving shijie. \\"In upper antiquity, there were many transcendents, so many that they cannot all be accounted for. But since the rise of the Han, only forty-five persons have attained transcendence‚Äîforty-six counting myself. Twenty of them did so via 'escape by means of a simulated corpse,' the rest all ascended to Heaven in broad daylight.\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 275). Campany summarizes five common features of shijie stories in the Shenxian zhuan and other early hagiographies. #Some adepts, when about to perform shijie, pretend to be ill and make a public announcement to that effect. This can now be seen as motivated by the need to make the \\"death\\" more believable‚Äîsomething necessary only if the death is being staged with intent to deceive. #When, after his feigned death, the adept is sighted alive, it is always at a distant place. #When, after such a sighting, the coffin is opened and found devoid of a corpse, some other object is always present instead‚Äîa talisman, a sword, a piece of clothing, or an entire outfit in the shape of a body. These objects are the substrata of the ritually and meditationally produced, illusory corpse that replaced the adept's own body long enough for him to escape. They are, in fact, so many shi Â∞∏‚Äînot in the sense of actual corpses but in the sense of ritual impersonator or simulacrum of the dead in the mortuary and commemorative rites. #If, in the narrative, the adept ever returns home (and often he does not), he does so only after considerable time has passed‚Äîusually more than a generation. #In some cases, the adept is said to have changed his names after performing shijie. The ubiquity of sobriquets rather than proper names for the subjects of hagiographies is probably also due to the name-changing strategy for eluding detection by spirits. (Campany 2002: 58‚Äì59) However, not every shijie narrative in the Shenxian zhuan conforms to these patterns. When Zuo Ci and Guo Pu were condemned to execution, they escaped through bingjie (ÂÖµËß£, \\"martial liberation\\") and simultaneously eluded the agents of both the imperial and the spirit world bureaucracies (2002: 59). =Zhen'gao= Shijie is frequently mentioned in the 499 Zhen'gao (Declarations of the Perfected), which is Tao Hongjing's collection of materials from the \\"Shangqing revelations\\" that were allegedly given to the mystic Yang Xi (330-c. 386) by a group of Daoist Perfected Ones from 364 to 370. Several revelations concern shijie methods and the destinies of Yang Xi and his aristocratic collaborators, Xu Mi (Ë®±Ë¨ê, 303‚Äì376) and his son Xu Hui (Ë®±ÁøΩ, 341-c. 370). Perfected Consort An (ÂÆâÂ¶É) suggests jianjie (ÂäçËß£, escape by means of a sword; here written jiejian Ëß£Âäç) to her spirit-fianc√© Yang Xi, \\"My lord, if you can't abide the smoke from windblown flames and wish to embrace Perfected form in a secluded wood, then could you just seek the Way of escape by means of the sword and perform the technique of announcing [your own] end? If you finish yourself off, doing it openly or in secret and leaving your trace [corpse-simulacrum] concealed or in plain view are matters to be separately arranged at the last moment. It's all up to you, discerning lord!\\" (tr. Smith 2013: 101). A Zhen'gao revelation from Mao Gu (ËåÖÂõ∫), one of the Three Lords Mao, discloses to Xu Mi that his missing elder brother Xu Mai (Ë®±ÈÇÅ, 300‚Äì348), had paired with a Perfected partner, retreated into the mountains, and escaped from the world by means of a \\"simulated corpse\\" (Smith 2013: 18). Another context says Xu Mai studied under his teacher Wang Shilong (Áéã‰∏ñÈæç), and \\"received the Way of loosening constraints [jieshu zhi dao Ëß£Êùü‰πãË°ú], practiced the method of walking backward, consumed jade fluid, and had audience at Brain-Essence [Palace]\\". This \\"Way of loosening constraints\\" may refer to the shijie variety called jiedai (Ëß£Â∏Ø, escape leaving one's waistband behind) (Smith 2013: 276). Others revelations tell Xu Hui that he will perform a \\"nocturnal escape\\", which apparently means staging death under cover of night, without using a simulacrum like a sword or staff, and tell Xu Mi that he is too preoccupied with worldly affairs to escape immediately (Smith 2013: 299). Zhen'gao passages provide a general outline of a complicated shijie process, which goes through several stages, usually over a span of many years. First, the practitioner must become \\"suitably detached\\" from worldly affairs. Second, one must be in the correct frame of mind that views life and death as opposite banks of the same river‚Äî\\"both are equal and essential\\". Third, after one escapes, the hun cloud-souls go to Grand Yin, the po earth-souls enter the earth, and the Four Numina and Five Male Ones preserve the body's seminal essence and five viscera. Fourth, once the cloud-souls arrive at Grand Yin (a place far in the north), they undergo further refinement, in a process like that which takes place in the alchemist's sealed crucible. Finally, all those who are fit for the process inevitably wake up as Perfected. \\"Only then can the practitioner truly understand the wondrousness of the spirit immortals' \\"dying but not perishing\\" and the profundity of the principles governing life and death\\". (Smith 2013: 300). Zhao Cui (d. 622 BCE) was a legendary Daoist transcendent who assisted Duke Wen of Jin (r. 636-628), and the Zhen'gao records that five to six years after he died, \\"a man travelling through the mountains one evening spotted this corpse inside a rock chamber. The flesh had rotted, but the bones remained. He also saw that the five viscera in the abdomen were still alive as before. The [bodily] fluids and blood were wrapped in bundles therein; a purple placenta was woven on the outside.\\" (tr. Smith 2013: 302‚Äì303) Many Zhen'gao passages mention alchemical drugs as a means to achieving shijie \\"release from the corpse\\". Chinese alchemists were aware that the metallic compounds produced in their furnaces were highly poisonous, but they believed that the practitioner would suffer only an apparent death while in fact passing into the heavens without dying (Bokenkamp 1997: 291; Smith 2013: 284). One context lists historical figures who achieved shijie by consuming the powerful alchemical Elixir of Langgan Efflorescence, which was compounded from toxic heavy metals. > Those who feigned construction of a tomb after swallowing Efflorescence of > Langgan are Yan Menzi [Ë°çÈñÄÂ≠ê], Gao Qiuzi [È´ô‰∏òÂ≠ê], and Master Hongyai [Ê¥™Ê∂ØÂÖàÁîü]. The > residents of the three counties (in which their graves are found) all call > them vacant tumuli of the dead of highest antiquity. They are unaware, > though, that on one occasion Gao Qiuzi entered Mount Liujing through > liberation by means of a corpse. He afterwards consumed a powder of > Liquefied Gold [ÈáëÊ∂≤], then ingested Efflorescence of Langgan at Zhongshan and > feigned the appearance of still another death, whereupon he at last entered > Xuanzhou [ÁéÑÂ∑û, \\"dark region\\" netherworld]. (tr. Strickmann 1979: 131, cf. > Needham and Lu 1974: 296) These practitioners notably do not ascend into the Shangqing heavens but live among the terrestrial paradises. The Shangqing School founder, Wei Huacun, who supposedly performed shijie herself (Bokenkamp 1997: 251), describes some others who performed it. > Finding the Way and leaving the world is done either visibly or in secret. > Using the body to leave a trace behind is the secret [approach to] the Way. > Some have taken two swigs of rose-gem essence and knocked on their coffins, > or consumed a speck of it once and had their corpses rot. Sire Deerskin > swallowed jade blossoms and the maggots streamed out his door; Youngest Son > Qiu gulped the gold fluid and the stench was smelled a hundred Ii away. The > Yellow Thearch, who fired the nine cauldrons [elixir] on Mount Jing, still > has a tomb at Qiao Peak; Sima Jizhu, who consumed mica powder to make a > covert ascent, still [left his] head and feet in different places. Mo Di > gulped rainbow elixir to throw himself into a river; Young Ning consumed > stone brains and rushed into a fire. Wu Guang cut leeks to enter Qingling > Pool; Bocheng Zigao absorbed pneumas, and his guts rotted three times. > People like these are beyond count. Isn't the Way subtle? In finding it, the > traces of one's inclinations and aversions are never constant.\\" (tr. Smith > 2013: 295‚Äì298) Sima Jizhu (Âè∏È¶¨Â≠£‰∏ª) was a diviner for Han Emperor Wen (r. 180‚Äì157 BCE); \\"head and feet in different places\\" (t√≥uz√∫y√¨ch√π È†≠Ë∂≥Áï∞Âá•) is a fixed expression for beheaded persons. The Zhen'gao translator Thomas E. Smith describes Wei Huacun as employing \\"graveyard humor\\", such as the name for mica powder, yunsan (‰∫ëÊï£, lit. \\"disperse like clouds\\") with san (Êï£ also meaning \\"scatter; vanish; (TCM) powdered medicine\\"), which is a pun for \\"vanishing powder\\" (2013: 300). The Shangqing classic Jianjing (ÂäçÂ∑†, Sword Scripture) compares several shijie alchemical preparations and says the lingwan (Èùà‰∏∏, Numinous Bolus) elixir is the only one that permits the adept to return home without changing his or her name. The Zhen'gao Appendix to the Jianjing describes the range of different techniques. > Those who manage to escape by means of the corpse through the use of other > medicines and are not transformed by means of the Numinous Bolus may not, in > any case, return to their hometowns, for the Three Offices would detain > them. There are those who die and revive. There are those who get beheaded, > only to emerge [again] from one side. There are those whose corpses > disappear before encoffinment. There are those whose human forms remain but > whose bones are not recovered, those whose clothes remain but whose forms > disappear, and those whose hair falls out but whose forms are lost. > Departing in broad daylight is called a superior escape by corpse, and > departing at midnight is called an inferior escape by corpse. (Smith 2013: > 304‚Äì305) This passage distinguishes two grades of shijie by the time of day when the adept leaves the world, superior bairi (ÁôΩÊó•, daytime; broad daylight) and inferior yeban (Â§úÂçä, midnight). The term bairi is usually translated as \\"in broad daylight\\" but more precisely means \\"midday; noon\\", in contrast to shijie proper at midnight. Hagiographies of Daoist immortals provide many examples of ascension to Heaven occurring exactly at midday, often expressed with the stock phrase bairi shengtian (ÁôΩÊó•ÊòáÂ§©, \\"ascending to Heaven in broad daylight\\"). These two ways of deliverance are distinguished by opposite but corresponding yinyang features: ascent and descent, midday and midnight, light and darkness, sun and moon. On one hand, ascent to Heaven is the way of non-return to the world, a spiritual journey ascending from one empyrean to the next. On the other, descent to Great Darkness is the way of return, one obtains a \\"second birth\\" and eventually comes back to the world (Pregadio 2004: 122). The reason for this inferior status of an adept who performs shijie is that despite their having attained an advanced spiritual state, it is insufficient for them to \\"ascend to heaven in broad daylight\\", and they need to undergo a transformational \\"refining the bodily form\\". As long as the adept continues dwelling in their physical body, they are able to focus upon creating their perfected body (Pregadio 2018: 391). Huang Shen's painting of Li Tieguai, 1757 Logically, a question about shijie occurs: \\"If \\"release from the corpse\\" serves to leave one's ordinary body and to generate a \\"perfected body\\", why would an adept ever return to their mortal body from which they wanted to be liberated?\\" The famed legend of Li Tieguai (\\"Iron-Crutch Li\\"), one of the Eight Immortals in the Daoist pantheon, illustrates that the function of this \\"recovered\\" body is to provide a means to cultivate the \\"perfected\\" body. Once when Li Tieguai was in deep meditation, his spirit left his body and was roaming in the heavens, but his disciples mistakenly thought that he had died and cremated what they believed was his corpse. When his spirit returned, Li realized that since his original body was no longer available, he had to enter the only available corpse, that of a lame beggar who had recently starved to death. Thus, what is to be \\"perfected\\" through shijie is not the physical form, Iron-Crutch only needed a body in order to continue his Daoist practices. \\"Even in this uncommon case of a forced \\"release from the mortal body\\", the focus of the practice is the perfected body.\\" (Pregadio 2018: 392). The Zhen'gao's Examination of the Corpse section is widely quoted (Strickmann 1979: 182). It gives wide-ranging criteria for verifying shijie \\"escape by an apparent corpse\\", reflecting the wide variety of escape methods and contingent factors (e.g., choosing to escape openly or secretly) that would tend to leave different signs on the corpse. > When a person dies, you must look at the body. If it is like that of a > living person, it is in all instances a case of escape by corpse. If you see > that the feet are not blue and the skin is not wrinkled, it is also a case > of escape by corpse. If the light of the eyes is undimmed and no different > from that of a living person, it is also a case of escape by corpse. If all > the head hair has fallen out but the body and bones are missing, it is in > all instances a case of escape by corpse. If an [apparent] escape by corpse > occurs in broad daylight, then even though [the person] is an immortal it is > not an instance of escape by corpse. (tr. Smith 2013: 300‚Äì301) Most of these criteria would allow a deceased master's disciples to announce that he or she had successfully achieved shijie \\"escape by corpse\\", except the one \\"broad daylight\\" criterion for not attaining shijie that actually indicates the highest form of transcendence, directly rising to heaven. Declaring successful shijie is easy, \\"none of the criteria are negative indicators of a failed quest\\". (Smith 2013: 301). =Daojiaoyishu= Even though the word shijie (Â∞∏Ëß£) was in use during the 1st century CE, before Buddhism had any influence in China, the meaning was probably later influenced by jiƒõtu≈ç (Ëß£ËÑ´)‚Äîthe Chinese Buddhist translation of moksha (liberation, emancipation, release) (Pas 1998: 58). Cross-borrowings between Buddhism and Daoism were so pervasive that many narratives about Buddhist monks include supposedly distinctive Daoist practices such as shijie (liberation from the corpse) and bigu (grain avoidance) (Campany 1996: 329, 2009: 59). For instance, the 648 Book of Jin records that the Buddhist monk Shan Daokai (ÂñÆË°úÈñã), a contemporary of the Central Asian missionary Fotudeng (c. 232‚Äì348 CE), \\"achieved a cicada-like metamorphosis by ingesting pills\\" (Needham et al. 1976: 112). The c. 700 Buddhist-influenced text Daojiaoyishu (Ë°úÊïéÁæ©Ê®û, Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings) describes shijie as the second of three types of bianhua transformations. The first is adepts who \\"ascend to Heaven in broad daylight\\" (bairi shengtian ÁôΩÊó•ÊòáÂ§©), merge with the divine, and roam together with the gods, which means that \\"one's entire person ascends to Heaven\\". > The second [type of transformation] is \\"release from the corpse\\" (shijie). > Some replace their corpse with a sword or a bamboo staff; all of a sudden, > they rise up and go, and abruptly they are no longer there. Some leave > behind their skin. Some receive a funeral and are buried, but then if their > coffin is opened there is only a staff or a shoe. Some roam to the five > sacred peaks, while some can rise to Heaven. In the Southern Palace > (Nangong) there is the Court of Flowing Fire (liuhuo zhi ting); in the > Golden Gate (Jinmen) there is the Water of Smelting Refinement (yelian zhi > shui). All those who inwardly ascend to Heaven while they are alive must > first go to the Court of Fire (huoting) in order to refine their form and > spirit, while those who rise to heaven after their death must first go the > Courtly Pond (tingchi) in order to refine their celestial soul(s) (hun) and > body frame. All this accords with the results of their practice (gongye). The third is \\"transfer by extinction\\" (miedu ÁÉïÂ∫¶, the Chinese Buddhist name for \\"Nirvana\\"), \\"The mortal form (shixing) does not become ashes, as if the corpse is guarded by the Great One (Taiyi) itself. Sometimes, after years, the corpse reverts to be a human being.\\" (tr. Pregadio 2004: 118). The shijie implements such as a sword or shoe perform a function similar to the tishen (ÊõøË∫´, \\"replacement bodies\\") used in some Daoist rites to represent the adept's negative and \\"unrefined\\" aspects, worldly bonds which made it impossible for one to achieve a higher form of liberation in life (Pregadio 2004: 125‚Äì126). Interpretations The term shijie \\"corpse deliverance\\" has \\"baffled scholars because the ideas and practices behind it have remained quite murky\\", perhaps owing to intentional secrecy among Daoist initiates (Campany 2002: 52). Academics cannot even decide how to translate the term. \\"Should we interpret it as deliverance of a person from the mortal coil of his corpse, as deliverance of a person's body from death and putrefaction, or as deliverance by means of a corpse? While arguments in favor of each of these interpretations have been offered, scholars essentially agree that \\"corpse deliverance\\" implies a freedom gained after either what really was or what appeared to be physical death.\\" (Cedzich 2001: 2). =Cicada metaphor= The oldest explanation of shijie is the cicada metamorphosis metaphor, which later became a standard Chinese literary trope, both of which first appeared in Wang Chong's 1st-century Lunheng. There are multiple parallels between a shijie practitioner leaving behind their (sometimes apparent) corpse and transforming into a xian transcendent and a cicada nymph moulting its exoskeleton, emerging as an adult, and leaving behind an exuvia. The Shenxian zhuan above uses the term ch√°ntu√¨ (Ëü¨Ëõª), which means both \\"cicada slough\\" (used in Traditional Chinese medicine) and \\"free/extricate oneself\\", to describe Cai Jing after his body had melted away for three days, \\"only his outer skin was left, intact from head to foot, like a cicada shell\\". Zhang Junfang's c. 1029 Yunji Qiqian (Seven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy Satchel) Daoist encyclopedia describes jianjie transcendence as ch√°nhu√† (Ëü¨Âåñ, \\"cicada transformation\\"), \\"When men use a precious sword for the deliverance of the body, this is the highest example of metamorphic transformations\\" (tr. Needham and Wang 1956: 141). Joseph Needham and Lu Gwei-djen say that Daoist alchemists believed immortality elixirs could generate \\"a new physical but immortal self, embodying the whole personality, which could leave the adept's corpse like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, and go off to dwell among the other immortals\\". Two possible results of shijie \\"liberation from the corpse\\" were either an empty coffin if the physical body had fully etherealized, or the changeless perpetuation of an adept's light body, never showing any signs of post-mortem decomposition (1974: 284). =Body preservation= The perfectly preserved body of Xin Zhui (d. 163 BCE) Needham and Lu also interpret that the remarkably well-preserved body of Xin Zhui or Lady Dai (d. 163 BCE), discovered in 1972 among Mawangdui tombs, showed that early Chinese mortuary specialists, whom they presume were Daoists, had sufficiently advanced chemical knowledge and skill to achieve an almost perpetual conservation, which suggests \\"for the first time all that [shijie] may have implied\\". Furthermore, they say this adds another dimension to the Daoist doctrine of physical immortality and suggests that traditional stories about incorruptible corpses were possibly based on fact (1974: 303‚Äì304). Lady Dai's body demonstrates that the Daoist conception of shijiexian \\"corpse-free immortals, whose bodies would remain century after century like those of persons still living, was not entirely imaginary (Needham et al. 1976: 21). =Ritual suicide= Michel Strickman convincingly proposed that the adept's \\"corpse\\" in shijie techniques was not always a temporary stand-in but in certain cases could be the cadaver of someone who achieved xian transcendence by means of ritual suicide through Chinese alchemical elixir poisoning. For a Daoist religious believer, suicide could sometimes be an acceptable way to escape during periods of social or political trouble. For example, Ge Xuan (164‚Äì244) resorted to shijie to flee from the oppression of Emperor Wu of Jin (1979: 132‚Äì133). In response, Isabelle Robinet contended that shijie \\"liberation from the body\\" was not a ritual suicide‚Äîan \\"interpretation that has grown up without any supporting evidence\\"‚Äîbut instead a procedure of salvation after death. When a practitioner dies before completing spiritual purification, a kind of \\"partial death\\" takes place, with an afterlife in an intermediate realm while it awaits a more complete purification and final deliverance (1997: 138). Ursula-Angelika Cedzich concurs with Strickman's ritual suicide hypothesis. In one of the best- documented cases, Tao Hongjing's disciple Zhou Ziliang (Âë®Â≠êËâØ, 497‚Äì516) received visions from Perfected Ones who guaranteed him transcendence into Shangqing heavens, and gave instructions how to compound a deadly potion of mushrooms and cinnabar, with which he committed suicide (2001: 33‚Äì34, 37‚Äì39). =Resurrection= Another interpretation of shijie centers around similarities with resurrection as the concept of coming back to life after death. Donald Harper studied documents found in Late Warring States tombs, including an official report that recounts a spectacular resurrection story. A man named Dan (‰∏π, cinnabar), who was employed by a general in the Wei army, committed suicide in 300 BCE because he had murdered a man. After Dan's burial, however, the general filed an official bureaucratic complaint with the netherworld administration claiming that he had not yet been \\"fated\\" to die, and they subsequently released Dan from the grave and returned him to the world of the living in 297 BCE (1994: 13‚Äì14). However, it took several years after his resurrection before Dan could hear or eat food again, and \\"his four limbs were useless\\" (1994: 22‚Äì23). Harper suggests that the concept of shijie began around the 1st century CE from a synthesis of ancient beliefs about resurrecting the dead and the Daoist notion of xian transcendence/immortality, \\"shijie was a special form of resurrection with elements that distinguished it from an already existing belief in resurrection in popular religion\\" (1994: 25). Julian Pas says that when Daoism adopted the shijie procedure, properly translated here not as \\"liberation from the body\\" but as \\"liberation through the body\\", it changed the focus from relying on official documents to revive a dead person to relying on self-cultivation to metamorphize into a xian transcendent (1998: 59). In addition, shijie has some parallels with Christian resurrection of the dead in which the deceased body is reunited with the soul. Describing the resurrection of Jesus, the Bible says his tomb was found empty, except for some grave clothes‚Äîwhich is reminiscent of Daoist shijie cases when the master's coffin is found empty except for some article of clothing left behind (1998: 60). =Escaping difficulties= In some cases, a Daoist adept carrying out shijie \\"escape by means of a corpse\\" was not attempting miraculous transcendence but was simply absconding from difficult demands, such as when Emperor Wu of Jin indefinitely detained Ge Xuan, he told his disciple, \\"I do not have the leisure to prepare the great drug [of immortality]. Now I will perform shijie.\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 59). The Book of the Later Han gives several examples. Xu Yang (Ë®±Ê•ä) was an expert in Chinese numerology, but when the usurper Wang Mang conscripted him into the new government, Xu changed his name and became a famed healer in a distant province, and returned home only after the Han army had executed Wang Mang in 23 CE. For similar reasons, Feng Liang (È¶ÆËâØ) supposedly killed his horse, smashed his carriage, tore his clothes to pieces, and disappeared. Everyone believed that wild animals had killed him, and his family buried the remains found at the site‚Äîbut Feng returned more than ten years later (Cedzich 2011: 40). Narratives involving this expedient type of shijie have common themes of name change and identity creation (Cedzich 2011: 27). This represents \\"a momentous abstention from the family lineage system that formed the spine of Chinese society\\" (Campany 2002: 55‚Äì56). The elaborate shijie process given above in the Lingbao wufu xu says, \\"After the adept has reached a safe place, they begin a new life under a pseudonym, but can never return home (where they might be recognized).\\" (tr. Campany 2002: 54). Finally, even the Shangqing patriarch Tao Hongjing himself, after years of unsuccessful alchemical experiments with immortality elixirs for Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502‚Äì549), desperately attempted to flee his imperial patron in 508 by changing his name to Wang Zheng (ÁéãÊï¥) and pretending to be an ordinary soldier (Cedzich 2011: 40).

It was approved by the Australian Government in 2015, and is due to be completed by mid-2022. History =Project management= While scoping the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations in the early 2000s, the official historian for that series, David Horner judged that work should commence as soon as possible on a separate series covering the Australian involvement in the operations in Afghanistan after 2001 and the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. However, when it approved this series in 2004, Cabinet excluded the Australian operations in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq from Horner's remit. In 2006 Horner sought the Australian Government's agreement to expand the series to include East Timor, but this was again denied, despite no additional funds being sought for books. Horner continued to advocate for a new series over subsequent years. At the launch of the first volume in the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations to be published in April 2011, Horner stated that it was a \\"national disgrace\\" that work was not underway on the next series. Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd indicated that he supported such a project in his remarks when launching the book. In September 2011 the Australian War Memorial (AWM) agreed to conduct a feasibility study into an official history on the operations in Afghanistan, East Timor and Iraq. This study was completed in 2012 by Horner, who judged that it would be feasible to prepare an official history of Australia's involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. The AWM Council endorsed this conclusion, and recommended that work begin as soon as possible. A submission seeking Cabinet's approval of the project was subsequently prepared. While initial versions of the submission proposed that it cover only operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was later broadened to also cover East Timor. The final submission proposed either expanding the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations to cover operations in the three countries up to 2006 or establishing an entirely new series. The political turmoil associated with the three changes of federal government in 2013 delayed official approval, with the submission being put forward and withdrawn on two occasions. In 2015 the Abbott Government authorised the official history. The approved scope of the series was operations in East Timor from 1999 to 2012; Afghanistan between 2001 and 2014; and Iraq from 2003 to 2011. A total of $12.6 million was allocated to the AWM for the project in the 2015‚Äì16 federal budget. The position of official historian for the series was advertised in June 2015. Craig Stockings was appointed to this role, and commenced on the project in March 2016. Applications for authors of the volumes in the series were sought in early 2016. There are some differences in how the Official History of Australian Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Australian Peacekeeping Operations in East Timor is being prepared compared to earlier Australian official history series. The budget for the project is much larger than that allocated for any previous official history, but the timeframe in which it is to be completed is also significantly shorter. In his letter commissioning Stockings as the official historian, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull specified that the series had to be completed by July 2022. Each of the authors was given five years to complete their volume, with Stockings having six years in which he is required to write a volume and edit the series. Stockings has written that the process of preparing the series \\"is a public service project, and needs to be managed as such\\". Despite these changes from previous practices, the authors continue to have access to all relevant files, and the freedom to reach their own conclusions. Stockings has written that the Government will not have the ability to influence the content of the books, other than to request that material which would cause security problems be omitted. In July 2018 NewSouth won the tender conducted by the AWM for a publisher for the series. =First volume on East Timor= In November 2019 it was reported that the official history project was \\"in danger of collapse amid claims that bureaucrats are trying to censor its first volume\\". The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had requested a very large number of changes to the first volume on East Timor to protect the reputations of senior Australian public servants and avoid damaging the Australian Government's relationship with Indonesia. Stockings was reported to have refused to make the changes and threatened to resign over the issue, which had delayed the book's publication. Former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has been told that the department objected to the book's first nine chapters, which cover the history of East Timor between World War II and the 1999 intervention. Downer also noted that while there may have been reasons to have not approved an official history of the intervention in 2006 due to Indonesian sensitivities, this was no longer the case. The official historians for the three previous official history series, Robert O'Neill, Peter Edwards and David Horner released an open letter regarding the issue on 19 November. The letter stated that censoring the volume on the grounds of diplomatic sensitivity would breach the Australian official history tradition, with material in previous series only being excluded if was information provided by foreign governments which those governments had not yet released or clearly had national security implications for Australia. The three historians called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne \\"to instruct her departmental officers to withdraw any objections, based on current diplomatic sensitivity, to publication of first volume of the current official history\\". Stockings and the then director of the AWM, Brendan Nelson met with Payne in 2019 to discuss DFAT's handling of the volume. In January 2020 the clearance process resumed using revised arrangements, and the acting director of the AWM informed Senator Rex Patrick that the institution was confident that this approach would prove successful. Patrick expressed concern, however, over the memorial refusing a freedom of information request he had lodged regarding the matter and the possibility that the book may be \\"doctored\\". Planned volumes An Australian and an Afghan soldier during a patrol in 2013; operations in Afghanistan will be covered by three of the six planned volumes in the series As of March 2018, it was planned to structure the series into six volumes, each written by a different historian. The planned structure of the volumes is: *Volume I: Operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East between 2001 and 2006 *Volume II: Operations in Iraq between 2003 and 2011 *Volume III: Operations in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2010 *Volume IV: Operations in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2014 *Two works on Australian peacekeeping operations in East Timor, split into: **Volume I: Operations during 1999 and 2000 **Volume II: Operations between 2000 and 2012. In 2017 Stockings noted that the volume on Iraq may be split into two books.

It is located in the Round Lake Auditorium in the village of Round Lake, New York. Originally located in the Calvary Church in Manhattan, it was moved to its present location in 1888, where it was used in Chautauqua-like summer programs into the 1920s. It is now owned and maintained by the village. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2016. Description The Davis-Ferris Organ is a basically free-standing instrument, mounted in a wooden case with Gothic features. The case may have been designed by James Renwick Jr., the architect who designed the Calvary Church where it was first installed. The case measures roughly , and is more of a protective enclosure than a structural supporting element of the instrument. It houses all of the working components of the instrument, including its three manuals, foot pedal board, air management system, and a network of wooden and metal pipes. Air movement is provided by an electric blower probably installed in the early 20th century, when the auditorium was electrified; before this time, the organ bellows were powered by a water-powered arrangement. The basic mechanical controls (stops, manuals, and the mechanisms they activate, are all basically original. Substantive changes to the instrument beyond the change in power source include the shortening of the longest pipes, needed to accommodate its new location, and it was likely revoiced after installation at Round Lake. Beginning in the 1970s, the instrument has been the subject of a long-running series of repairs to its condition, occasioned in part by a forty-year period of neglect. The organ was built in 1847 by Richard M. Ferris for the Renwick- designed Calvary Church in Manhattan. Ferris was then briefly in partnership with William H. Davis, another organ builder, hence the name of the instrument. It remained in use at the church for about forty years, when the church vestry decided that the instrument was no longer compatible with its ecclesiastical practices. Around the same time in the 1880s, the Round Lake Methodist camp meeting was in decline as a religious venue, and had been expanding its summer offerings to include more secular Chautauqua-like summer presentations and programming. In 1888, possibly stimulated by the acquisition of the organ or prompted by its availability, the Round Lake trustees began offering musical programs as well. The organ continued to a play a role in these until the association went into decline in the 1920s. Interest in the instrument was revived in the 1960s, after which the village has embarked on a continuing series of repairs, rehabilitation, and improvements of the instrument and the hall.

Two of its stories had received an O. Henry Award. Algren received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters the same year.  Overview  The book collects 24 stories: 8 previously published (from 1933 to 1947) and 16 new. Most of them are set in then-contemporary Chicago (1930s and 1940s), in the so-called \\"Polish-American ghetto\\". They revolve around the lower classes: workers and unemployed, drunkards and gamblers, prostitutes and hustlers, small-businessmen and policemen. Unlike Dickens or Zola, their general tone is tragi-comedy or sympathetic satire. Two stories had received an O. Henry Award (and been reprinted in the related annual volume): Algren's second-published story \\"The Brothers' House\\" (1935 award) and \\"A Bottle of Milk for Mother (Biceps)\\" (1941 award). Two had been selected for The Best American Short Stories: \\"A Bottle of Milk for Mother\\" (as \\"Biceps\\", 1942 volume) and \\"How the Devil Came Down Division Street\\" (1945 volume).

She served in several roles during the entire First World War. She was also a specialist in tuberculosis (TB). Early life Mangin was born in Paris on October 11, 1878. Both of her parents came from Varennes-en-Argonne, in the north-east region of France. Her father was a school teacher. Mangin started her medical studies in 1896. In 1899, she married Andr√© Girard, adopting his surname alongside her own as Girard-Mangin. She interrupted her medical studies to help her husband on his family's vineyard in the Champagne region. After a son was born, the couple decided to get a divorce. Girard-Mangin resumed her studies and was able to submit her thesis in 1909. She specialised in tuberculosis and contagious disease, later opening a TB clinic and starting research on cancer. First World War Girard-Mangin playing with her dog Dun In early August 1914, the French military was mobilising across the country. France was rapidly calling up as many soldiers, nurses, and doctors it could in advance of the war that could start at any moment. Girard-Mangin, who was still using her ex-husband's surname, was called up. There might have been an error in her paperwork, which led to a clerk thinking that he was calling up Dr. Gerard Mangin. Nevertheless, her paperwork was in order and as a result, she became the first woman doctor in the French Army; however, she lacked an official rank or the pay of a doctor. Her first posting saw her at a former health spa in Bourbonne-les-Bains, where her superior did not approve of having a woman as a doctor there. He wrote several times to headquarters requesting that Girard- Mangin be removed from this post. His requests were consistently refused as the French army still had a massive shortage of qualified doctors. Within a week of her posting, she saw her first patients, a trainload of wounded soldiers. By November, she was posted to a military hospital at Verdun, where she stayed at until February 1916. She also received her first rank, as an Auxiliary Doctor, but her pay remained at nurses' level. In Verdun, she treated patients with typhoid. However, starting in February 1916, the German launched an unexpected attack on the Verdun section. The Germans made major advances in a short amount of time. It became apparent that the hospital where Girard-Mangin was working might soon be captured by the enemy. She was able to escape, along with all of her patients. During the evacuation, Girard-Mangin was wounded when a shrapnel piece smashed the window of the vehicle that she was in. Soon afterwards, she confronted her superior officer over her lack of rank and pay. After several months, she was promoted to Doctor Major, 2nd Class and awarded backpay. In 1917, she was promoted to the rank of doctor- captain and was appointed to be director of training program for nurses at the Edith Cavell Hospital in Paris. While in Paris, she campaigned for the French Union for Women's Suffrage. She was a participant American Red Cross sessions about tuberculosis. Death Girard-Mangin died on June 6, 1919, of a suspected overdose. Her biographer suggests that she was suffering from an incurable cancer and wished to shorten her suffering. An atheist, Girard- Mangin received a civilian funeral. She was cremated at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, her ashes interred in the family tomb at Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s.

She was the 2018 Democratic nominee for Texas's 23rd congressional district, and was narrowly defeated by the incumbent Republican Will Hurd. In May 2019, she launched a second campaign for the office, and in August 2019, Hurd announced that he would not seek another term in 2020. Raised in San Antonio, Texas, Jones attended college on a Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship, after which she became a United States Air Force intelligence officer, served in the Iraq War, and eventually reached the rank of captain. Early life and education Born on February 1, 1981, in Arlington, Virginia, Jones grew up in San Antonio, Texas, as a first- generation American daughter of a single mother, Victorina Ortiz, an Ilocano from Pangasinan, Philippines. Her mother emigrated to the U.S. and earned a teaching certificate. Jones graduated from John Jay High School in 1999. She earned a four-year Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) scholarship, allowing her to enroll at Boston University. In 2003, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies and a master's degree in economics. A lesbian who came out to her mother at 15, Jones served under the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy, where she was at risk of losing her AFROTC scholarship if her sexual orientation was disclosed. She later earned a master's degree in military arts and sciences at the School of Advanced Military Studies of the United States Army Command and General Staff College. Career After graduating from college, Jones joined the United States Air Force as an intelligence officer and deployed to Iraq during the Bush Administration. After three years of active duty and reaching the rank of captain, she returned to Texas in 2006, working for a consulting company while caring for her mother, who had colon cancer (from which she eventually recovered). Jones then returned to working as an intelligence analyst for United States Africa Command in Germany. In 2008, she joined the Defense Intelligence Agency, where she specialized in Latin American topics; ultimately she became a special adviser to the deputy director. In November 2016, she moved to the Executive Office of the President to serve under the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Having previously served under presidents of both parties, Jones continued in her role during the Trump administration until June 2017, when she left her role, telling HuffPost, \\"The type of people that were brought in to be public servants were interested in neither the public nor the service ... That, to me, was a sign that I'm going to have to serve in a different way.\\" She returned to San Antonio to run for Congress, living in the house where she grew up. =2018 congressional campaign= In 2017, Jones was the first Democrat to announce a challenge to Republican Representative Will Hurd in Texas's predominantly Hispanic 23rd congressional district, which includes much of the border between Texas and Mexico. Hillary Clinton won the district by three points in the 2016 United States presidential election and neither party had controlled the congressional seat for more than two consecutive terms since 2007. Jones finished first in the March 6, 2018, Democratic primary, earning 41 percent of the vote in a field of five. Rick Trevi√±o was second with 17.5 percent. As no candidate received a majority of the vote, a runoff election was held on May 22, which Jones won. She faced Hurd in the November 6 general election, in what was called the most competitive congressional race in the state. As of June 30, Jones had raised $2.2 million while Hurd had raised $2.4 million in addition to the $1.5 million with which he entered the race. With four months remaining, Jones was approaching the district's record for election fundraising by a Democrat ($2.7 million). Jones was endorsed by EMILY's List, the Asian American Action Fund, the Equality PAC, VoteVets, and the LGBTQ Victory Fund, as well as Wendy Davis and Khizr Khan. Some journalists named Jones as part of several \\"waves\\" of candidates from various backgrounds running as Democrats in 2018, including women, LGBT people, and military veterans. A March 2018 Teen Vogue article noted that if elected, Jones would be \\"the first openly gay woman of color from Texas elected to Congress, as well as the first Iraq War veteran to represent Texas in Congress. She'd also be the first woman to represent Texas's 23rd Congressional district.\\" Jones said she believed healthcare reform would play a big role in the election. She and Hurd both broke fundraising records. Jones lost to Hurd by 1,150 votes and conceded on November 19.https://news4sanantonio.com/news/local/gina-ortiz- jones-concedes-race-to-incumbent-will-hurd =2020 congressional campaign= In May 2019, Jones launched a second campaign for Texas's 23rd congressional district.

In October 2019 The Texas Tribune reported that she was the primary front-runner. In May 2020, former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg's Win the Era PAC endorsed Jones.

They were one of the first units sent over after America had entered the war just a month before on April 6, 1917. Hall was appointed Chief Nurse and Dr. Harvey Cushing was appointed as director of the unit. The unit was posted to the British Expeditionary Force. The unit took over a General Hospital 11 from the British. As the American Expeditionary Force had not yet arrived, Hall and her unit treated mostly British and Canadian soldiers. In a letter to the New England Red Cross, she described that her hospital could manage up to 700 soldiers within a 24-hour period and not be overwhelmed. In September 1917, Hall was managing 108 nurses and assistants in the base hospital and forward operating areas. At the time, nurses were given no rank in the military structure. Hall wrote to her family where she vented frustration at the insubordination of other ranks towards her and other supervisors. After nearly a year in her position, she was transferred away from the front-lines to become the chief nurse of American Red Cross in Great Britain. There she saw the war end, with the armistice being signed on November 11, 1918. In early January 1919, she was appointed as the chief nurse of the American Red Cross in France. After the war She returned to her position of superintendent at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. In addition to her role at the hospital, she worked on improving education across the country for nurses and also campaigned for better pay for nurses which included advocating for nurses pension plans. As part of her advocacy, she gave several addresses at various conferences and to nursing associations across the country. at several conferences including speaking at the Graduate Nurses' Association in DC. She served on the board of the National League of Nursing Education for ten years starting 1922. She held the position of president from 1925 to 1927. She retired from her position at Brigham hospital in 1937. In her honor, the hospital named a conference room for her. After her retirement in 1939, she was elected Vice President of the Community Nursing Council of Boston. She died on November 17, 1963.

Hinge bills itself as a \\"relationship app\\" and claims to emphasize more long term connections between users. History Hinge was founded by Justin McLeod in 2012. The mobile app version of Hinge was first developed in early 2013 and launched in February of that year. The app was designed to be less superficial than Tinder, dispensing with Tinder-like swiping and using the slogan \\"the relationship app\\". Before Hinge gained enough users on the platform to sustain the business, the platform nearly ran out of funding. When making the mobile app, McLeod spent much of the remaining company cash on a launch party to be held in Washington D.C. The party allowed Hinge to gain the next round of funding and saved the app from going under. Hinge formerly used connections to Facebook friends to facilitate connections. The app has since moved away from using friends of friends as a predictor of compatibility and has been rebuilt to no longer require Facebook login. In 2017, Hinge received the most mentions compared to other dating apps in the Weddings section of The New York Times. The company released Hinge Matchmaker in September 2017 to reinvent online dating for \\"people that missed out on the dating app craze\\". Match Group made investments in Hinge as early as September 2017. On June 20, 2018, Match Group acquired 51% ownership of Hinge, with the right to acquire all the remaining shares within the next 12-month period, which it exercised. Match Group owned 100% of Hinge by the first quarter of 2019. In 2019, US presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg revealed that he met his husband on Hinge. Hinge is in the process of setting up a department, Hinge Lab, which will focus on researching successful matches on the app to help fine-tune the app's algorithm and other features. Operation Hinge has sought to be identified as more attractive to a younger demographic than Match.com or eHarmony. The app has a \\"Your Turn\\" feature designed to remind a user to continue a conversation. This feature was designed with the intention of decreasing ghosting. Profiles on Hinge are composed of pictures as well as three self-selected personal prompts. The prompts encourage users to focus on personality traits rather than just photos. When using Hinge, users are presented with other profiles in a vertical timeline format. Instead of swiping, users have to respond to specific photos or prompts when liking a profile. Hinge allows users to filter matches based on traits that Hinge believes are important to its members, such as religion or height. Unlike other dating apps, users can message other users without having to \\"match\\" first. In 2018, Hinge launched a \\"We Met\\" feature. \\"We Met\\" lets matched users privately confirm whether or not they went on a first date with their match in order to find more compatible matches. In July 2018, Hinge rolled out its \\"most compatible\\" feature, which uses the Gale‚ÄìShapley algorithm to find what they claim are the best matches for users. Once per day, users get a match that makes what Hinge claims is the best pairing, purportedly based on user liking and passing activity. Marketing Hinge's marketing focuses on how the app is \\"designed to be deleted\\", with its mascot, Hingie, getting roasted in a campfire, encased in ice in a freezer, run over by a cab, flattened by an air-conditioner, etc., when two Hinge users fall in love. In 2020, the app launched Hingie Shop, selling products that can be \\"destroyed\\" such as bath bombs and smores.

She was a founding member of Twenty Melbourne Painters. She was also the first woman to have a solo exhibition in Castlemaine, Victoria. Biography Elsie Frederica Barlow n√©e Hake was born in 1876 in Melbourne, Australia. She was one of seven children, the youngest of six girls born to Sidney Hake and Charlotte Hemsley. In 1894, Barlow enrolled at the Gallery School of Design where she was taught by Frederick McCubbin and Lindsay Bernard Hall. She attended the National Gallery School with her sister Dora Serle. Elsie and Dora both showed an early interest in art, taking classes at St Kilda Town Hall when they were kids. She was represented in an exhibition of Australian art at the Grafton Galleries London in 1898. Her painting Welcome News came second to Max Meldrum for the National Gallery School Travelling Scholarship in 1897. In 1901 she married police magistrate Arthur Barlow, assistant to Sir John Madden. They had three children, a son Basil in 1904, daughter Nancy in 1906, and Betty in 1907 who died a few months after birth. They lived in Maryborough in 1909 and moved to Castlemaine in 1912. In 1912 Barlow held a one woman show at the Mechanics' Institute in Castlemaine, where she displayed 90 paintings. This led to the eventual creation of the Castlemaine Art Gallery. She had a studio in Collins Street with her sister Dora from 1899 to 1901. Barlow moved to Melbourne in 1916 and Arthur died shortly after. She opened a new studio in the Dunklings Building in Melbourne in 1919, holding an exhibition of 76 paintings and 6 pen drawings in June of that year. She is acknowledged as the first woman to paint snowscapes which she would do by leaving the paper to weather outdoors while visiting her friend May Vale at Sassafras. Barlow was a founding member of the Twenty Melbourne Painters Society. Barlow died in a private hospital in Mentone, Victoria on 15 November 1948.

The battle took place during the final stages of the German Spring Offensive. The battle began as a peaceful penetration action launched over several days by troops from the Australian 9th Brigade, to advance their lines around Morlancourt through a series of small raids against the opposing German 199th Division. Afterwards, both sides rotated their forces in the area and the Germans subsequently launched a counter-attack against the Australian 5th Brigade. This attack was eventually repulsed and the line held until June, when the Third Battle of Morlancourt took place around Morlancourt as the Australians secured the Morlancourt spur to consolidate their positions on the Somme before the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. Background Situated on the northern bank of the River Somme, Morlancourt is about north-east of Amiens, in the Somme department of northern France. The battle took place against the backdrop of the German Spring Offensive, which saw the Germans launch an offensive on the Western Front that had rapidly gained ground through the Somme after it had commenced on 21 March. In late March, troops from the Australian 3rd Division had clashed with the German 18th Division in the First Battle of Morlancourt, when the Australians advanced to fill a gap in the Allied line that had formed north of the River Somme as the Germans had continued their advance towards the railhead at Amiens. The Australian advance was checked just short of their objective, the cross spur overlooking Morlancourt. In April, the Germans had launched a thrust south of Ypres towards the railhead at Hazebrouck and the channel coast during the Battle of the Lys. By April, the Australian 3rd Division's line between the Somme and the Ancre, representing a frontage of around had advanced very little since the First Battle of Morlancourt. To improve command and control along the front, on 22 April the two Australian divisions holding the line in the area ‚Äì the 3rd and the 5th ‚Äì were reorganised, pushing their boundaries further north, so that the two rivers were incorporated inside the lines of the same formation, rather than being sitting astride them. The 10th Brigade (Brigadier General Walter McNicoll) of the 3rd Division took over some of the line previously held by the 7th Brigade, 2nd Division. They began working to advance their line forward north of the Ancre as the line in this sector was nearly behind the line on the south side. Battle In late April, the 11th Brigade (Brigadier General James Cannan), which held the line south of the 10th Brigade, was relieved. Their replacements were the 9th Brigade (Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal). This brigade had been detached from the 3rd Division earlier and had taken part in the fighting during the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. Due to heavy casualties, the 9th Brigade had been reduced to three battalions: 33rd, 34th and 35th Battalions. Its fourth battalion, the 36th had been disbanded to provide reinforcements to the other battalions in the brigade. It had been given two weeks' rest before being rotated into the line, where they assumed a position between the 10th Brigade on their left and the 5th Division's 8th Brigade on their right. Map depicting Australian positions between the Somme and Ancre during the battle On 29 April, while touring the front, it had become apparent to Rosenthal that his brigade's outpost positions on his right were isolated and vulnerable due to a series of sunken roads, vegetation and other terrain features that provide cover for a German surprise attack. Rosenthal decided it was necessary to push his line forward across the valley to the next slope. The 34th Battalion, holding the southern part of the 9th Brigade area, was detailed for the task. They would be supported by the 3rd Pioneers and fatigue parties from the 33rd Battalion, to dig trenches and lay out wire obstacles. The 35th Battalion, holding the northern part of the brigade front, would clear several German positions in front of its line to the protect the flank of the 34th Battalion. Direct fire support was provided by the 10th Machine Gun Company, while the 9th Light Trench Mortar Battery provided indirect fire support. Between 4 and 9 May, the Australians attempted to capture the German front line positions around Morlancourt, which were held mainly by troops from the 237th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 199th Division. Using peaceful penetration tactics, the Australians launched raids over several nights. The raids proved largely successful, except for an abortive attempt on 7 May, when the late issuing of orders resulted in a hasty and poorly co-ordinated operation that resulted in a company from the 34th Battalion ‚Äì with reinforcements from the 33rd ‚Äì being cut off, after having broken into positions held by the German 114th Infantry Regiment. Surrounded on each flank, when daylight came, the company was forced to surrender. The raids succeeded in advancing the Australian line . Casualties during the fighting in the first part of May amounted to 264 killed or wounded for the Australians and at least 170 Germans captured. After the loss of their front line positions, the Germans reinforced their positions around Morlancourt. The 31st Infantry Regiment was detached from the 18th Division and loaned to the 199th Division, moving into the line around the Bray‚ÄìCorbie Road. The Australians also rotated their forces, with the 2nd Division relieving the 3rd, who had been in the line for almost seven weeks. On 11 May, the area around Morlancourt was assigned to the 5th Brigade, consisting of the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Battalions, which had been out of the line resting. As the 2nd Division's 6th Brigade began preparing to capture Ville to the north, the 5th Brigade began sending out patrols opposite Morlancourt, securing several prisoners and machine guns. Throughout 13 May, efforts were made to locate a German outpost opposite the 17th Battalion and at 3:00 am the following day 4.5-inch howitzers from the 107th and 108th Batteries shelled the position. A patrol was then sent out to ascertain the effect of the shelling but it was turned back by heavy machine gun fire, which confirmed that it was still intact. At 3:45 am, the Germans retaliated with a heavy artillery bombardment against the 17th Battalion's positions around the Bray‚ÄìCorbie Road. Following this, the Germans launched a counter-attack against the 5th Brigade with 200 troops, seeking to regain some of the positions lost to the 34th Battalion during the earlier Australian raids. The attack overran several Australian posts before it was checked and then after a heavy mortar barrage, the three forward Australian companies launched their own counter-attack which subsequently cleared the trenches and released the Australians that had been temporarily taken prisoner. By 10:30 am the fighting had concluded with another 48 soldiers from the German 31st Infantry Regiment being captured. Against this, the Australians had lost a further 60 men killed or wounded. Aftermath Following the failed counter-attack, the Germans rotated their forces along the Morlancourt front, bringing the 107th Division into the line, while throughout 15 May the German artillery fired a heavy bombardment of the Australian lines. Minor actions continued along the line until 18 May as the 18th Battalion sought to shore up its left flank. This included a daylight raid across no man's land, during which the Australians took advantage of the heat of the day when many of the German sentries were asleep, to surprise a German position. The Australians reached their objective without a shot being fired. After the Australians threw a grenade, the remaining Germans in the trench surrendered. There was a brief exchange of fire with a neighbouring position, which was quickly overcome before the raiding party returned to their lines. A total of 22 Germans were captured in the raid. Elsewhere, in late May, the Germans launched the third major blow of their Spring Offensive, attacking the French in Third Battle of the Aisne. On 10 June 1918, the day after the Germans launched an attack aimed at the Montdidier‚ÄìCompiegne‚ÄìSoissons railway, a third battle took place around Morlancourt. This saw the Australian 7th Brigade capture the Morlancourt spur, which overlooked village of Sailly-Laurette, to the south of Morlancourt. The Australians then worked to consolidate their position ahead of further actions on the Somme, including the Battle of Hamel in early July. Capture of the spur completed the process which had begun with the earlier two battles and helped the Allies set the conditions required for further actions prior to the final Hundred Days Offensive. The final Allied offensive began in August 1918 and ended the war. As a result of the final battle, 325 Germans were taken prisoner, while the Australians lost 400 killed or wounded.

Location The facility is located within the dormant Aluto volcano, a volcanic complex of the Ethiopian Rift valley trending NNW‚ÄìSSE with several craters up to 1 km wide, between Lake Langano and Ziway. The site is approximately , by road, southeast of Addis Ababa, the largest city and capital of Ethiopia. The geographical coordinates of this power station are: 07¬∞47'19.0\\"N, 38¬∞47'41.0\\"E (Latitude:7.788611; Longitude:38.794722). Overview The Aluto‚ÄîLangano geothermal field at the dormant Aluto volcano covers an area of about and is considered to be capable of generating up to of electric power. It features temperatures in excess of 300 ¬∞C in a high- temperature up-flow dome at a minimum subsurface depth of around 1200 meters. The geothermal field and its characteristics like stratigraphy, geochemistry and hydrothermal behavior are relatively well explored. The Aluto‚ÄîLangano Geothermal Power Station (dubbed Aluto‚ÄìLangano I) is the oldest geothermal power station in Ethiopia, established in 1998 with a nameplate capacity of and a net power generation capacity of . In 1998, the power station was considered a pilot plant to explore the features of the Aluto‚ÄìLangano geothermal field, it used four of the eight drilled wells. It is still the only geothermal power station in Ethiopia 20 years later on in 2018. Two small wells (LA-3 & LA-6) deliver high pressure high temperature steam from areas of high temperatures in excess of 300 ¬∞C to a conventional combined cycle steam turbine, while the non-condensed exhaust steam and mid-temperature mid- pressure steam from two other small wells (LA-4 & LA-8) drive a bottoming combined cycle steam turbine. Both turbines were considered to deliver around each. A re-injection well (LA-7) exists as well. Several events (in particular corrosion, but also hydrothermal blockages, leakages, lack of operation knowledge of the plant personnel) led to several drops in the power generation capabilities several times between 1998 and 2018, followed by extensive repairs and rehabilitation works addressing in particular corrosion damages. The pilot power plant was out of operation for most of its existence. For most of the operating time, only the conventional combined cycle unit was operational (with only the two wells LA-3 & LA-6 operating). In 2018, the Aluto‚ÄîLangano Geothermal Power Station was able to generate less than of electric power and is essentially mothballed. Expansion / replacement works (dubbed Aluto‚ÄîLangano II) started in 2013 and delivered two more high- temperature wells in excess of 300 ¬∞C (LA-9D & LA-10D). Future works (from the viewpoint of 2018) are set to expand the total generating capacity of the geothermal field to ~ by re-using the existing wells and by drilling another 8 large production-ready wells. New power generating units, which are able to withstand the corrosive steam, have to be installed as well. The Aluto‚ÄîLangano Geothermal Power Station is one of three grid-ready geothermal power stations in the country in different phases of operation or construction, the other two are the ~ Corbetti Geothermal Power Station (exploration phase) and the Tulu Moye Geothermal Power Station (exploration phase), also with a capacity of ~500 megawatts. History First exploration works started in 1981. The feasibility studies for this power station were conducted in 1986. The report concluded that the area could support a commercially viable geothermal power station. In 1998, a geothermal power station was erected to prove the production ability of the geothermal field, with 7.3 MWe net capacity. One of the two power generation turbines went out of operation already in December 1999, the second one stopped working in 2001. Rehabilitation works put the conventional combined cycle steam turbine back into operation by 2007 and the bottoming combined cycle steam turbine back into operation in 2009, but the effective power generation capacity of both turbines was reduced to ~ 5 MWe. Ageing contributed to a decrease of power output again and in 2018, less than 1 MWe was generated. The second turbine is essentially decommissioned and the power plant almost out-of-operation. Currently, the Ethiopian Ministry of Mines & Energy is in the process of expanding the plant. The International Development Association has committed to lend US$126 million of the projected total cost of US$218 million. In March 2018, the EEP advertised for a contractor for the project. The selected company is expected to provide two geothermal drilling rigs and accessories, rig operations and maintenance for drilling geothermal wells along with all the accessories, heavy machinery, trucks and vehicles. In February 2019, EPP contracted Kenya Electricity Generating Company to drill steam wells.

Harlequin MIRA) The Lost is a 2014 novel by Sarah Beth Durst. It tells the story of Lauren Chase, a woman who decides to go for a long drive rather than face the results of tests her mother has had, and who ends up in the fictional town of Lost. Actress Selma Blair bought the rights to the novel in 2018 intending to adapt it to film. Plans for a sequel called The Missing were already in development by the time the novel was published. Plot Lauren Chase is a young woman from California who has allowed her mother to move in with her after her struggles with cancer. After realizing that her mother's cancer might have returned Lauren gets into her car and drives all day. Caught up in a dust storm Lauren hallucinates a mysterious man with feather tattoos on his chest and winds up in the town of Lost where she is given free food and lodging. Preparing to go home the following morning she is once again caught up in the dust storm. After driving in and out of it several times she is eventually rescued by the tattooed man who turns out not to be a hallucination. Returning to Lost looking for help, Lauren is told that she will receive aid from the Missing Man. However when Lauren meets the Missing Man and tells him her name he refuses to help her or the other residents of Lost and walks away. As none of the residents can leave Lost until the Missing Man helps them, they are terrified of Lauren and shun her. After an angry mob sets upon her, Lauren is rescued by a six year old child named Claire who rescues Lauren as she is the only person she has ever seen independently walk in and out of the dust storm. Lauren is taken to the apartment of Peter, who turns out to be the man with the tattoos. Peter tells Lauren that only lost things and people end up in Lost and no one can leave without the Missing Man. Peter, who is a \\"finder\\" of the lost, decides to help Lauren as she is the only other person, aside from himself, who the Missing Man has ever refused to help. Lauren and Claire, and eventually Peter, decide to seek shelter in one of the many abandoned houses around Lost. Claire and Peter teach her to survive by scavenging. Lauren holds out hope that she will one day be able to leave even without the Missing Man and eventually spends an entire day biking around the outskirts of Lost, looking for a weakness in the perpetual dust storm that surrounds the town. Instead she realizes there are no weaknesses, and witnesses the void toss up cars, lost objects, and a house. Returning, Peter shows Lauren some of the things that the void has left them, including the lost paintings The Storm on the Sea of Galilee and Chez Tortoni, in order to comfort her. As the Missing Man continues to stay away from Lost, the void that borders the town begins to move closer. Lauren goes to investigate and finds Veronica, a waitress who has become crazed after her lover, Sean, was taken by the expanding void. Veronica threatens to shoot Lauren and Lauren offers to go into the void looking for Sean, knowing that Peter will try to rescue her. Lauren does not find Sean but she does find a ring. She and Sean are rescued by Peter and when Lauren shows them the ring Sean recognizes it and uses it to propose to Veronica. The two develop the glow that Lost residents obtain when they are ready for the Missing Man to send them away from Lost. Sean and Veronica spread the news about Lauren and more Lost residents begin to show up at her door looking for help. Lauren manages to help several of them, including one resident who trades information about her own death for the location of Claire's parents, who did not in fact abandon her as she believed, but who moved to Scottsdale, Arizona after being devastated over her disappearance. Despite the fact that she is able to help people, Lauren continues to want to return to her mother. To help her Peter goes finds the Missing Man. The Missing Man eventually returns and tells Lauren that her mother is dying but she cannot yet return to her as she has yet to discover the reason she came to Lost. He also teaches Lauren to help people with the glow move on by placing her hands on them and saying \\"You were lost; you are found.\\" Lauren accidentally uses this technique to send Claire back to the real world. Devastated she creates a found object art piece which gives her the glow, since what sent her to Lost was the fact that she had abandoned her creativity and desire to make art. Peter begs Lauren to stay as the town of Lost needs her to continue sending people back to the real world. He also confesses he loves Lauren, but she sends herself back to the real world. Lauren wakes up in a hospital where she learns that she has been in a coma for three months and was found in a car accident on the very day she left home. Her mother is also in the hospital having been diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. Lauren is convinced that Lost was a hallucination, but she continues to find objects from Lost in the real world, objects she could not have known about before. Beginning to believe Lost was real, Lauren decides to take her mother there since the people of Lost never leave and even if dead their souls remain in the town. Before she can leave with her mother however her mother's condition worsens forcing her to remain in the hospital. Lauren tells her mother about her plan to leave and Lauren's mother told her they would have never found Lost together since Lauren's mother was never lost as long as she had Lauren. After her mother's death Lauren gets in her car and prepares to return to Lost. She first seeks out Claire. Unexpectedly, when she arrives in Scottsdale she sees that Claire has integrated happily back in real life. Lauren drives on until her car runs out of gas looking for Lost. She is about to give up hope that she will find it when she finally walks straight into the dust storm.

It is endemic to New Zealand.  Taxonomy  A. pessota was first described by Edward Meyrick in 1887 under the name Miselia pessota. In 1906 this species was tentatively placed in the genus Sympistis by George Hampson. Meyrick, in 1911, disagreed with this placement but somewhat doubtfully suggested placing the species in the genus Hypnotype. Meyrick again reconsidered the taxonomy of this species in 1914 and placed it within the genus Andesia. Robert J. B. Hoare studied the species and placed it within the genus Austramathes in 2017.  Description  George Hudson described the species as follows:  Distribution  A. pessota can be found in Northland, in the southern North Island and in the South Island, mainly on the eastern side that island.  Host species  Larvae of this species feed on Melicytus alpinus and Hoare states it is likely that Melicytus micranthus is also a host.

Life  Irving was born in New York City in 1984. She is the daughter of film director David Irving and landscape designer Susan Irving. Her paternal grandparents are theater director Jules Irving and the actor Priscilla Pointer. She is the niece of the actor Amy Irving. In 2006, Irving graduated from the Tisch School Of The Arts at NYU with a BFA from the Department of Photography and Imaging. In 2017, she was the artist-in-residence at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India. In 2019, she will be the artist-in-residence at the Varda Artist Residency in Sausalito, California.  Career  Irving works in the medium of large scale analog photography. Her photographs explore liminality and metageography, anthropocentrism, and the tension between natural and manmade environments. From 2007 onward, she worked on a photo series entitled NOT AN EXIT, which showcased real-world optical illusions created from narrow angles in functional hallways and doorways. These photographs have been called Escher- esque, a reference to M. C. Escher. Her photo series SHOW CAVES received significant media and academic interest for its interrogation of the ethics and impact of ecotourism, specifically the concept of government and commercially operated show caves. As a result, Irving was asked to sit on a panel for a public forum on rural economies at Virginia Tech's annual conference for Appalachian Studies Association, where the socio-economic impact of commodifying rural arts, culture, environment, and heritage to create a tourist industry in rural Appalachia was debated. In 2017, Irving's photographs from her NOT AN EXIT series were included in the exhibition Reimagining A Safe Space at NYU. The exhibition explored the notion of safe spaces, especially examples of and challenges to the concept. This series showcased real-world optical illusions created from narrow angles in functional hallways and doorways. Within the exhibition, the series was credited with providing context for the contested topic of safe spaces. In 2019, two works from NOT AN EXIT were also included in the third Every Woman Biennial in New York City curated by C. Finley, an answer to the Whitney Biennial which showcases diversity among contemporary female and queer artists. Irving has stated that her photographic practice is motivated by the wish to find relief from the \\"extreme internal discomfort\\" of living with body dysmorphic disorder. Irving's images are made with a 4x5 view camera and are presented as large scale photographic prints. = Awards and nominations = In 2015 her photo series SHOW CAVES was a finalist in both the Architecture and Landscape categories for the Felix Schoeller Photo Award in Osnabr√ºck, Germany. In 2016, she was a nominee for the United States Artists Fellowship. In 2019, her project NOT AN EXIT was awarded a gold medal at the Prix de la Photographie Paris in the Fine Arts/Architecture category. while her project PLANTS IN EXILE was awarded gold in the Nature/Trees category. In 2019, an image from PLANTS IN EXILE was awarded third place in an international photography competition held by the New York Center for Photographic Arts.

He was accused to receiving monetary corruption when he led the Naval Intelligence office under the staff of Adm. Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff from 1994 until 1997. He was subsequently court-martial but his matter was later subjected to cover-up by the Pakistani military under the Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf in 1999. Biography The Agosta 70A of the Spanish Navy in 2017. Ashraf reportedly accepted a bribe of ‚Ç®. 1.5 million. Shahid Ashraf was born in 1947, and joined the Navy in 1964. He saw the military actions during the second war in 1965 and third war in 1971 with India, respectively. In 1995, Captain Ashraf was appointed in the Navy NHQ and was appointed as the Hydrographer of the Navy Hydrographic Department under then-Adm. Mansurul Haq, the Chief of Naval Staff. In 1996, Capt. Ashraf was promoted to one-star rank promotion, and was subsequently appointed as the Director-General of the Naval Intelligence (DGNI). During this time, Cdre. Ashraf was briefed by the Naval Intelligence led by Rear- Admiral Javed Iqbal on Navy receiving the massive illegal financial credits from French Navy under the auspicious of the Adm. Mansurul Haq. Cdre. Ashraf later confronted the Adm. Mansurul Haq but joined the later when Adm. Mansurul Haq subsequently pressure him, according to the officials inquiries of the Naval Intelligence. In 1997, Cdre. Ashraf handed over the command of the Naval Intelligence to Rear-Admiral Tanvir Ahmed and departed to the United Kingdom to attend the war course at the Royal College of Defence Studies in Great Britain. In 1997, Rear-Admiral Tanvir Ahmed eventually exposed the military scandal after his led the arrests of Adm. Mansurul Haq and later winding up his operation when he requested the government to recall Cdre. Ashraf from his overseas studies. The Navy JAG prosecution leveled its charges on Cdre. Ashraf of receiving ‚Ç®. 1.5 million when he faced the court martial in Zafar Naval base in Islamabad. In 1998, Cdre. Ashraf, alongside with Capt. Liaquat Ali Malik and Capt. Z.U. Alvi, pleaded guilty of taking the bribes and was subjected to imprisonment for nearly seven years. However, Cdre. Ashraf maintained in the court martial inquiries that he sought the permission of leading towards catching the foreign agent who was giving bribe money to naval officers but was not allowed to do so by the Navy NHQ. His case findings were later subjected to the military cover-up by Chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf in 2000 from the inquiries of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). In 2010, Ashraf later blamed the outcomes of the scandals on successive government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and senior naval officers in the Navy NHQ but declined to comment his role in receiving ‚Ç®. 1.5 million. He claimed that the corruption charges leveled up on Bhutto-Zardari family, were politically motivated when Sharif family being the most beneficiaries of the Agosta submarine deals.

In the early days of racing, most racing series had no mandated uniforms. Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, specialized racing suits were designed to optimize driver temperature via heat transfer, and later to protect drivers from fire. By 1967, the majority of competitors in Formula One, NASCAR, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), United States Auto Club (USAC), and Champ Car (the predecessor to modern IndyCar) began wearing specialized fire suits. Most modern suits use Nomex, a material developed in the 1960s around the time fire suits emerged. The suits are also known for prominently displaying driver sponsors. Design and use IndyCar driver Helio Castroneves wearing a Shell-branded Nomex firesuit and head sock A racing suit is designed to cover the entire body of a driver, crew member, or marshall, including long sleeves and long pant legs. Typical driver suits are one-piece overalls, similar in appearance to a boilersuit. Other fire suits are two piece, consisting of a \\"jacket\\" and pants. The suits consist of a single or multiple layers of fire-retardant material. The suits also have special epaulettes or yokes on the shoulder area that act as \\"handles\\" in order to lift a driver strapped to a racing seat out of a vehicle. This is mandated under F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety standards. Most suits use fabric made of Nomex, a synthetic material produced by DuPont that retains its fire-retardant properties with time and use. Other suits consist of cotton treated with Proban, a chemical manufactured by Rhodia, or other substances. These suits can lose their fire-resistant properties over time, particularly after washing. Other suits are made of Kevlar, polybenzimidazole fiber (PBI), or carbon fibers, but are less widely used due to lack of comfort and color variety. Newer suits, such as those produced by Sparco, have inner liners treated with menthol to create a cooling sensation and fight odor. Additional accessories, including fire-resistant long underwear, gloves, shoes, and balaclava-like face masks or \\"head socks\\" are also worn. When Nomex material is exposed to flame, instead of burning or melting it develops a carbon char. The char thickens the section of fiber exposed to the flame, preventing the spread of the fire to the rest of the suit and inhibiting the transfer of heat to the wearer of the garment. CarbonX is a different fabric for fire suits made of oxidized polyacrylonitrile (a precursor to carbon fiber). It is created by heating material until it oxidizes and chars, with the finished product able to last for two minutes exposed to fire. It is frequently used for racing undergarments and gloves. Using multiple layers of the material, and quilting of the fabric, meanwhile, create pockets of air which further insulate the wearer from heat. The suits are not entirely fireproof, but rather fire retardant for a period of time, allowing an individual to escape an incident or be rescued with minimal injury. Bill Simpson, an innovator in racing safety, estimated in 1993 that a person has \\"20 to 30 seconds\\" before a fire suit begins to burn. The mandated minimum level of protection for uniforms in different racing series varies, as does the minimum standard for drivers, crew members, and officials. In the NHRA drag racing series, for example, suits are designed to last 30 to 40 seconds before the wearer suffers second degree burns. This is a higher benchmark than that of most other series, due to the high risk of fire from nitromethane and alcohol-fueled cars. SFI Foundation, Inc., formerly part of SEMA, dictates the suit fire protection standards for numerous sanctioning bodies particularly in the United States, including NASCAR, IndyCar, the NHRA, the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), and the United States Auto Club (USAC). The FIA determines the standards for most of its series such as Formula One and the FIA World Endurance Championship, excluding the standards of its drag racing competition which are determined by SFI. SFI and FIA standards are used by other organizations outside their jurisdiction, such as the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS). Both SFI and the FIA use the Thermal Protective Performance (TPP) test to measure the effectiveness of fire- retardant clothing. This test, created by DuPont in the 1970s, measures the amount of time in seconds before the wearer of a garment suffers second degree burns. For example, a garment that lasts three seconds before second degree burns occur receives a TPP value of 6. Under SFI standards, this would receive a rating of 3.2A/1, the lowest possible SFI rating. =Non-fire retardant suits= Suits in several other classes of racing are similar in appearance to fire suits, but are not designed to be fire resistant. Suits used for kart racing are not typically fire retardant, but rather are made to be abrasion resistant using leather, nylon or cordura. Suits used for motorcycle racing, called motorcycle leathers, are also designed to be abrasion resistant. They consist of leather or a similarly-strong material, with nylon and spandex fabrics prohibited. Fire-resistant undergarments are optional to provide fire protection. The Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK) and FIA regulate specifications for karting suits. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) regulates suits for numerous racing series such as MotoGP and the AMA Supercross Championship. =Branding= Since the 1980s, racing suits have been customized to prominently feature the sponsors of drivers and teams, leading to designs similar to those of the race cars. For fire suits, the material used to make the sponsor patches must also be fire proof, adding additional weight to the suit. Many modern suits, however, use printed logos in order to reduce weight. History Prior to the advent of fire-retardant racing suits, there were no mandated driving uniforms in most racing series. In NASCAR competition, for example, many drivers and crew members would wear jeans and other typical street clothes. American firm Hinchman had manufactured specialized racing suits since the mid-1920s, worn by drivers Babe Stapp and Pete DePaolo. In the 1950s, NASCAR Grand National (NASCAR Cup Series) driver Tim Flock began wearing a specialized racing suit, which became popular in the 1960s. At this time, the suits were designed with an inner liner meant to keep drivers cool. Soon afterwards, in several series racing suits or any driver clothing used in competition were soaked in chemical solutions to make them fire-retardant long enough for a driver to escape an incident. In NASCAR, a baking soda solution was typically used, while the SCCA mandated racing suits treated in boric acid or borax. Boraxo, a brand of powdered soap largely composed of borax, was often used as treatment. The catalyst for developing racing suits that could effectively resist fire came in the late 1950s and 1960s, when several fiery crashes occurred in the motorsport world. In 1959, Jerry Unser died from burns suffered in a crash practicing for the Indianapolis 500. In 1963, NHRA Top Fuel driver and Division 7 Tech Director Chuck Branham died after suffering burns in a crash. During NASCAR's 1964 World 600 (today's Coca-Cola 600), Fireball Roberts was involved in a crash on lap seven while avoiding two other cars, passing away five weeks later. Roberts had asthmatic reactions to the clothing treatment used by NASCAR, and had received a waver against using it. One week later during the 1964 Indianapolis 500, drivers Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs were killed in a seven-car crash on the second lap of the race. Following the incidents, Jim Deist and Bill Simpson, who developed some of the first drag parachutes, released the first racing suits designed to be fire-retardant. Both suits were \\"aluminized\\" in order to be flame resistant. Simpson's suit consisted of a modified cotton boilersuit. In 1959 after the death of Unser, all Indy 500 competitors were required to wear fire-retardant clothing. In 1963, the FIA assumed responsibility for driver safety in its series, and mandated fire-retardant suits for Formula One drivers. In 1964, the NHRA mandated fire suits for its competitors. By the fall of that year after Roberts' crash, nearly all NASCAR competitors began wearing fire suits, although no official rule was in place. In 1966, Simpson met NASA astronaut Pete Conrad, who introduced Simpson to the Nomex material used in spacesuits for the Apollo program. Around the same time, DuPont also approached the Hinchman company about producing Nomex racing suits. In that year's Indianapolis 500, driver Mel Kenyon wore a Nomex fire suit produced by Hinchman. Later that year, several drivers began testing experimental Nomex suits for Simpson, including F1 drivers Walt Hansgen and Masten Gregory, NASCAR driver Marvin Panch, and SCCA Trans-Am Series driver Bob Tullius. Simpson's company Simpson Performance Products released the first commercial Nomex racing suit, called the \\"Heat Shield Firesuit\\", in 1967. The suits were worn by 30 of 33 competitors in the 1967 Indianapolis 500. ESPN reporter Shannon Spake wearing a fire suit in 2009 By 1970, the NHRA along with SEMA began developing specifications for fire suits, using the Thermal Protective Performance (TPP) standard developed by DuPont. These specifications are now used by SFI. During the 1970s, racewear manufacturer Stand 21 partnered with brake manufacturer Ferodo and a french producer of firemen's suits to create single-layer asbestos racing uniforms. These suits never became popular, as the dangers of asbestos exposure became more well-known. Actor Steve McQueen was believed to have worn asbestos suits when performing stunts for films, which may have contributed to his contraction of mesothelioma. In 1975, the FIA introduced its current standard for fire-retardant suits. At this time, DuPont created a new Nomex blend using Kevlar to prevent tearing and increase the longevity of suits. In 1979, several F1 drivers including Niki Lauda, Mario Andretti, and Carlos Reutemann began competing in bulky five-layer suits constructed to NASA specifications. In the mid-1980s, companies began designing fire suits to prominently display team sponsors. In 1986, the FIA introduced new specifications for fire suits, known as \\"FIA 1986\\" certification. At the 1989 Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 NASCAR event, ESPN/ABC broadcaster Dr. Jerry Punch was reporting from the pit stall of Richard Petty when a fire broke out, injuring two crew member who Punch proceeded to treat on the spot. Following the incident, in which several items of Punch's clothing were singed or melted, ESPN mandated that its pit reporters wear fire-retardant suits. Other networks have since adopted the practice. In 1994, the FIA mandated fire suits for F1 pit crew members. By this time, crews in IndyCar were also required to wear fire suits. In 2002, NASCAR officially mandated fire suits for both drivers and crew members servicing the car during pit stops. This was in response to non-fire-related incidents in the previous season, including the death of Dale Earnhardt at the beginning of 2001, and a pit road accident at the Pennzoil Freedom 400 near the end of the season. NASCAR was one of the last major sanctioning bodies to mandate fire suits for crew members. List of racing suit manufacturers *Adidas *Alpinestars *Awesome Racewear *Impact!

The cattle station was built between 1890 and 1969. As a national park, the property is owned by the NSW Officer of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Mount Wood Station is east of Tibooburra, New South Wales, and gives its name to the Parish of Mount Wood.  History  Expeditions were made through the area in Australia's early history. These included Charles Sturt (1847-48), who undertook an expedition into central Australia during which the party was stranded for several months at both Fort Grey and Depot Glenn (near Milparinka); and Burke and Wills (1860-61), in which this expedition passed northwards through the eastern section of the national park (probably Mount Wood.  Description  Mount Wood Homestead complex is today within Sturt National Park. The national park is representative of the shrub rangeland in western New South Wales, it provides one of the best examples of this land type in conjunction with wattle (Acacia spp.) dominated fluviatile and aeolian land types. The area, due to its size, is an important wildlife refuge, and has a significant species diversity including 246 native species, as well as a high diversity of landforms including Aeolian dune systems, Mitchell Grass Plains, the Jump Ups and Gibber Desert. The national park lies in the south-west of a vast bowl shaped depression which covers eastern central Australia, and is mainly covered by low undulating plains of Gibber Desert in the east or sand dunes in the west except for where it contains the south-western end of the Grey Range. Here the Jump Ups, a range of low flat topped hills (mesa) run through the centre of the park and along its eastern boundary. Just inside the park boundary at Tibooburra is a granite outcrop which has formations of hilltop tors. The southern extremity of the Grey Range in the north of the park has associated mesa formations and eroded gullies, the remainder of the park has the occasional stony hill and many drainage basins. The park has three major vegetation associations, these include a mulga association; saltbush association; and bluebush association. =Complex features= The Mount Wood Homestead complex comprises: ;Landscape features, including fields; *Mt. Wood camping ground, north-east of homestead complex; *Visitor car park, north of homestead complex and east of vehicle shed; *Self-guided walk, runs in a ring around homestead and stables complexes. *Thomson's Creek runs (when it is running) south of the homestead complex. There is a suspension bridge over the creek east of the complex and east of the woolshed. The garden comprises a line of eucalypts behind the kitchen and laundry/store; two trees to the right hand side (in plan) of the 1897 homestead; two paths linking the two homesteads (1897, 1935); a drift of three eucalypts in front of the 1935 homestead; a pepper tree (Schinus molle) near the stone hut () and poultry runs; regrowth vegetation to the left (in plan) of the radio aerial and poultry runs; and horse yards, from the 1960s.Brueggemann, 2016, 3. 7 ;Homestead The homestead is in fact two homesteads connected via a covered link between the 1897 homestead that is stone, square, with a verandah all around, and the second homestead. Inter-war, c.1935 The homestead retains elements from each stage of its history in archaeological or standing form. Its important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of its archaeological values.Freeman, 1997 ;Shearers Quarters (1955) Located south-east of the homestead complex and north of Thomson's Creek, this is a complex of three structures that includes the shearer's quarters (1955); a kitchen; and other unidentified structure. The shearers quarters retains elements from each stage of its history in archaeological or standing form. Its important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of its archaeological values. ;Woolshed Located south-east of the homestead complex across (south of) Thomson's Creek near the suspension bridge. ;Woolscours The woolscour has been well researched, and is still the only 19th century station-based scour demonstrated to have survived largely intact. While comparative research is still patchy, the Mount Wood woolscour appears to be a rare survival of a once common pastoral technology, critical to the settlement of the pastoral frontier. ;Vehicle shed s shed on a concrete slab and pier foundation, supported by round painted steel pipe posts with dooden rafters and battens, clad in painted corrugated iron. The shed is roughly long, deep and high. Wooden roof support structure (battens and beams).Brueggemann, 2016, 4 Other structures include outstations, archaeological sites, ruins that include shed base (beside the vehicle shed); former approach track (towards garden and homestead); tank base (near generator shed); standing structures include, in a cluster around the stables, gallows (1960s); dog kennels (); horse yards (1960s); cow bail; stables (1960s); generator shed (1955); fuel shed (1955); metal racks; g.i.tank; blacksmith's shop and workshop (); pump (1930s); and vehicle shed. In a cluster around the homestead there is a laundry and store (1958); kitchen (1939); meat house; saddle room; stone cistern (1897); station tanks (4); galvanised iron fence; stone hut (); poultry runs; radio aerial. To the left of the homestead and stables complex (in plan), site of radio aerial arrays. The individual elements vary in age, but even the most recent are located upon traditional sites of pastoral operations, and an unusually complete representative sample of the elements typical of pastoral stations survives, as archaeological sites, ruins, standing structures or landscape features.  Heritage listing  As at 11 January 2002, Mount Wood Homestead complex, shearers quarters, woolshed, woolscours and outstations are significant in that they demonstrate a continuity of pastoral activity in the arid north-west of NSW over a one hundred year period. The individual elements vary in age, but even the most recent are located upon traditional sites of pastoral operations, and an unusually complete representative sample of the elements typical of pastoral stations survives, as archaeological sites, ruins, standing structures or landscape features. The extant evidence clearly illustrates the themes of housing, isolation, land tenure/settlement, pastoralism and technology. Some elements of the place are significant in their own right. The woolscour has been well researched, and is still the only 19th century station-based scour demonstrated to have survived largely intact. While comparative research is still patchy, the Mount Wood woolscour appears to be a rare survival of a once common pastoral technology, critical to the settlement of the pastoral frontier. The shearers quarters and homestead retain elements from each stage of their history in archaeological or standing form. They are both important documents of the long history of station operations, and a potential research resource in terms of their archaeological values. Individual elements have aesthetic (architectural) and scientific (archaeological and technological) values. The survival of the range of elements present at Mount Wood is believed to be already uncommon in western NSW, and may become increasingly rare as time passes.Freeman, 1997: Vol 1, p51 Mount Wood Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

In 1994 she became one of the few women awarded the title Hero of the Russian Federation.  Early life  Akimova was born on 5 May 1922 to a Russian peasant family in the village of Skopinsky within the Ryazan Governorate of the Russian SFSR. After graduating from secondary school she entered history classes at the Moscow Pedagogical Institute in addition to nursing courses. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 she applied to enlist in the Red Army but her request was initially denied and she was sent to assist in construction of defensive fortifications around Mozhaysk.  Military career  After Marina Raskova got Stalin to approve the establishment of three women's air regiments, women that had applied to join the military but were initially denied were sent for training. Many of them were sent to the Engel's Military Aviation School in Saratov, where women deployed into the 588th Night Bomber Regiment were trained before they were sent to the front. Akimova was put into the navigator's group where she studied an accelerated navigation course that lasted three years in peacetime but was compressed into just three months due to the war. After graduating from the courses the aviators were deployed to the Southern Front in May 1942, but she was not appointed to be a flight navigator until March 1943. From then on until the end of the war in 1945, Akimova made 715 combat sorties on a Po-2 biplane. In April 1945 she was nominated for the title of Hero of the Soviet Union with references from Konstantin Vershinin and Marshal of the Soviet Union Konstantin Rokossovsky, but people in Moscow did not support the nomination and she was eventually awarded the Order of Lenin instead. Her nomination cited her having accumulated 805 flight hours in combat and 680 sorties by April 1945, in which she had dropped 94 tons of bombs, destroying two ammunition depots, two ferries, two searchlights, and seven cars as well as dropping over 450,000 leaflets.

It was released on Macintosh, Windows, and Windows 3.x. A sequel entitled Let's Talk About Me Too was released in 1997. Development Some of the proto girl's games were Jenny of the Prairie, Cave Girl Clair, Kirsten and her Family, and Sara and her Friends in the 1980s. In 1995, software designer Lara Groppe continued this trend by researching girl's use of computers; she found they used them for shorter bursts and preferred content that was educational as well as entertaining. As a result, she founded the company GirlGames in 1993 and created Let's Talk About Me as its debut title. Heather Kelley was hired in October 1995 as the company moved from Houston to Texas; her role was to do research for the game. Groppe has apparently shown her resume to her mum, who said on the spot \\"hire her\\". She split her time between working on the game and on the website. Development was unusual in the sense that the target market directly provided input in shaping the product rather than playtesting it upon completion. Success of market leaders such as this title, Purple Moon, Her Interactive, and Girl Tech would all be founded in 1997. Gameplay With no plot to speak of, the game plays as an activity center for 10-14-year-old girls, with both quizzes and minigames that explore themes such as horoscopes and fashion. The game was specifically designed for girls and as such there is no combat and most of the games have no right or wrong answers. The game consists of four sections entitled \\"My Personality,\\" \\"My Body,\\" \\"My Life,\\" and \\"My Future\\", which excluding the last one that is based on conjecture mix educational content with fun gameplay. One such game explores the \\"perils of puberty\\". The sequel features sections entitled My Diary, My Hairmaster Deluxe, My Zodiac Zone, and My Personality. SuperKids described it as an \\"interactive, multimedia version of Young Miss magazine\\". Critical reception SuperKids felt the game offered a reason to get girls interested in using the computer, which was deemed a positive due to girls lagging behind boys when it came to PC use. Millennium Girls: Today's Girls Around the World felt it was a slow, girl- gendered counterpart to the \\"twitch\\" games that appealed to boys. New Trends in Software Methodologies, Tools and Techniques felt the games were excellent programs for teenage girls. In its first eight months on the market, the game sold half a million copies. Critical Readings: Media And Gender felt the game's success in the marketplace offered proof that young woman were a viable target market for video gaming.

It was released on December 8, 2016 and included on the duo's extended debut album Act One: The Complete Collection. The song was written by the members of Marian Hill (Samantha Gongol and Jeremy Lloyd) and Jauregui, and produced by Lloyd. It is Jauregui's first release outside of Fifth Harmony. Production Marian Hill and Jauregui said that the song began with the two of them on a plane and Jauregui in a hotel room, and the track was recorded in producer Jeremy's bedroom. Gongol commented that the duo and Jauregui had been wanting to work together since they met at one of Marian Hill's shows over a year earlier, and they managed to complete the song with her in a brief period she had outside her tight schedule with Fifth Harmony. Lloyd said that Jauregui told them she had already written her verse about five minutes before she was going to record it, and she \\"nailed the rhyme scheme and did so probably quicker and more deftly than we could have done\\". Lloyd also complimented the harmonies Jauregui wrote, saying that she has \\"an amazing harmonic ear\\". Critical reception \\"Back to Me\\" was called a highlight from Act One by Idolator. The AU Review named it \\"Single of the Day\\", calling it \\"sexy and icy at the same time\\" and complimenting its \\"bluesy groove\\". For The Fader, Marian Hill's Samantha Gongol and Jauregui's voices \\"play really nicely off of each other\\". Emilee Lindner of Fuse wrote that \\"Jauregui's smooth, husky voice finds a home on the trippy, hip-hop-tinged song\\". The Inquisitr's Clare Mulligan described the song as \\"woozy and minimalist, with a hypnotic background beat and a chanted chorus.\\" Time magazine's Raisa Brunner recommended the song, writing that it \\"plays with negative space\\" and praising and Lloyd's \\"sharp\\" production and Gongol and Jauregui's voices.

Biography Short was born in Rochester, Indiana in 1883. He grew up in Concordia, Kansas, where, as a youth, he became known for his public speaking skill. Upon graduation, he read law in the offices of Pulsiver and Alexander, passed the bar in 1916, and was eventually elected Concordia City Attorney. He was a Democratic candidate for the U. S. House of Representatives for Kansas, in 1930, against incumbent James G. Strong, who narrowly defeated Short in a close race. He ran again in 1932, and was defeated in the Democratic primary by Kathryn O'Loughlin McCarthy, who would go on to become the first female U. S. Representative from Kansas. Despite these setbacks, he remained active in the Democratic party, and was elected Party Chairman in 1934, directing the effort to unseat incumbent Governor Alf Landon. Although Landon won re-election, Short presided over two first-time Democratic victories in Kansas, the offices of State Auditor and State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Short died in 1936, of pneumonia. His brother was American baseball player Harry Short.

Two families, with eight members in total, escaped the communist country of East Germany by crossing the border to West Germany in a homemade hot air balloon. The plot to accomplish this was carried out over a period of one and a half years, including an unsuccessful attempt, three different balloons, and various modifications until the successful escape occurred. One failed crossing alerted the government to the plot, but the police were not able to identify the suspects before their flight to the west. Background Diagram of border fortifications The Eastern bloc country of East Germany was separated from West Germany by the Inner German border and the Berlin Wall, which were heavily fortified with watchtowers, land mines, armed soldiers, and various other measures to prevent its citizens from escaping to The West. The East German border patrols were instructed by standing order to prevent border penetration by all means including lethal force (Schie√übefehl (\\"order to fire\\")). Peter Strelzyk, (1942-2017), an electrician and former East German Air Force mechanic, and G√ºnter Wetzel, (born 1955), a bricklayer by trade, were coworkers at a local plastics factory who had been friends for four years. They shared a desire to flee the country and began discussing ways to cross the border. On March 7, 1978, they agreed to work to plan an escape. They considered building a helicopter but quickly realized they would not be able to acquire an engine capable of powering such a craft. Next, they decided to investigate the idea of constructing a hot air balloon, having been inspired by a television program about ballooning. An alternate account is that they were given a magazine article about the International Balloon Festival in Albuquerque, New Mexico by a relative. Construction The pair began research into balloons. Their plan was to escape with their wives and total of four children (aged 2 to 15). They calculated the weight of the passengers and the craft itself to be around . Subsequent calculations determined a balloon capable of lifting this weight would need to hold heated to . The next calculation was the amount of material needed for the balloon, estimated at . The pair lived in P√∂√üneck, a small town of about 20,000 where large quantities of cloth would not be available without raising attention. They tried neighboring towns of Rudolstadt, Saalfeld, and Jena without success. They traveled to Gera where they purchased wide rolls of cotton cloth totaling in length at a department store after telling the astonished clerk that they needed the large quantity of material to use as tent lining for their camping club. Wetzel spent two weeks sewing the cloth into a balloon shaped bag, wide by long, on a 40 year old manually-operated sewing machine. Strelzyk spent the time building the gondola and burner assembly. The gondola was made from an iron frame, sheet metal floor, and clothesline ran around the perimeter every for the sides. The burner was made using two bottles of liquid propane household gas, hoses, water pipe, a nozzle, and a piece of stove pipe. Test The team was ready to test the craft in April 1978. After days of searching, they found a suitable secluded forest clearing near Ziegenr√ºck, from the border and from P√∂√üneck. After lighting the burner one night, they failed to inflate the balloon. They thought the problem could be because they laid the balloon out on the ground. After weeks of additional searching, they found a cliff at a rock quarry where they could suspend the balloon vertically before inflation but that was also unsuccessful. Next they decided to fill the bag first with air at ambient temperature before using the burner to raise the air temperature to provide lift. They constructed a blower with 14-hp motorcycle engine, started with a Trabant automobile starter power by jumper cables from Strelzyk's Moskvitch sedan. This engine, quieted by a Trabant muffler, turned long fan blades to inflate the balloon. They also used a home-made flamethrower, similar to the gondola's burner, to pre-heat the air faster. With these modifications in place, they returned to the secluded clearing to try again but could still not inflate the balloon. Using the blower did allow them to discover that the cotton material with which they fashioned the balloon was too porous and leaked massively. Their unsuccessful effort cost them 2,400 DDM. Strelzyk disposed of the cloth by burning it in his furnace over several weeks. Second attempt The pair purchased samples of different fabrics in local stores, including umbrella material and various samples of taffeta and nylon. They used an oven to test the material for heat resistance and created a test rig from a vacuum cleaner and a water-filled glass tube to determine which material would allow the vacuum to exert the most suction on the water. This would reveal which material was densest. The umbrella covering performed the best but was also the most expensive. They instead selected a synthetic kind of taffeta. To purchase a large quantity of fabric without arousing too much suspicion, they again drove to a distant city. This time they traveled over to a department store in Leipzig. Their cover story this time was that they were in a sailing club and needed the material to make sails. The quantity they needed had to be ordered, and although they feared the purchase may have been reported to East Germany's State Security Service (Stasi), they returned the next day and picked up the material without incident. They paid 4,800 DDM () for of fabric. On the way home, they also purchased an electric motor to speed up the pedal-operated sewing machine they had been using to sew the material into the desired balloon shape. Wetzel spent the next week sewing the material into another balloon, accomplishing the task faster the second time with the now-electric sewing machine. Soon after, they returned to the forest clearing and had the bag inflated in about five minutes using the blower and flame thrower. The bag arose and held air, but the burner on the gondola was not powerful enough to create the heat needed for lift. They continued experimenting for months, doubling the number of propane tanks and trying different mixtures of fuels. Disappointed with the result, Wetzel decided to abandon the project and instead started to pursue the idea of building a small gasoline engine-powered light airplane or a glider. Strelzyk continued trying to improve the burner. In June 1979, he discovered that with the propane tank inverted, additional pressure caused the liquid propane to gasify which would create a bigger flame. He modified the gondola to mount the propane tanks upside down, and returned to the test site where he found the new configuration produced a long flame. Strelzyk was ready to attempt an escape. First escape attempt On July 3, 1979, the weather and wind conditions were favorable. The entire Strelzyk family lifted from a forest clearing at 1:30am and climbed at a rate of per second. They reached an altitude of according to an altimeter Strelzyk had made by modifying a barometer. A moderate wind was blowing them towards the border and freedom in West Germany. The balloon entered a cloud, atmospheric water vapor condensed on the balloon and the added weight of the water caused the balloon to descend. They landed safely approximately from the border at the edge of the heavily mined border zone. Unsure of where they were, Strelzyk explored until he found a piece of litter - a bread bag from a bakery in Wernigerode, an East German town. The family spent nine hours carefully extricating themselves from the wide border zone to avoid detection. They also had to travel unnoticed through a restricted zone before hiking back a total of to their car and all the launch paraphernalia they left there. They made it home just in time to report absent due to sickness from work and school. The balloon was left where it landed and discovered later that morning. Strelzyk destroyed everything remaining and sold his car fearing that could connect him to the balloon. On August 14, 1979, the Stasi advertised for help finding the \\"perpetrator of a serious offence\\" and listed in detail all the items left at the crash site. He felt that the Stasi would eventually trace the balloon to him and the Wetzels. Strelzyk conferred with Wetzel and they agreed their best chance was to quickly build another balloon and get out as soon as possible. Successful escape Example of balloon gas flame at night The pair decided to double the balloon's size to in volume, in diameter, and in height. They needed of taffeta, and purchased the material, in various colors and patterns, all over the country to escape suspicion. Wetzel sewed a third balloon, using over of thread and Strelzyk rebuilt everything else as before. They were ready in six weeks with a balloon, and a payload of , including the gondola, equipment, and cargo (the two families). Confident in their calculations, they found weather conditions right on September 15 when a violent thunderstorm created the correct winds and set off for the launch site in Strelzyk's replacement car (a Wartburg) and a moped. Arriving at 1:30 am, they needed just ten minutes to inflate the balloon and three to heat the air. They lifted off just after 2:00 am and, due to not cutting the tethers holding the gondola to the ground synchronously, it tilted sending the flame towards the fabric which caught fire. After the fire was put out with an extinguisher they had brought for just such an emergency, the balloon climbed to in nine minutes, drifting towards West Germany at . They flew for 28 minutes, with the temperature at and no shelter as the gondola was just a railing of clothesline. A design calculation resulted in the burner stovepipe being too long, causing the flame to be too high in the balloon creating excessive pressure which caused the balloon to split. Air rushing out of the split extinguished the burner flame. Wetzel was able to re-light the flame with a match and had to do so several more times before they landed. At one point, they increased the flame to the maximum possible and rose to . They later learned they had been high enough to be detected, but not identified, on radar by West German air traffic controllers. They had also been detected on the East German side by a night watchman at the district culture house in Bad Lobenstein. The report of an unidentified flying object heading toward the border caused guards to activate search lights, but the balloon was too high and out of reach of the lights. The tear in the balloon meant they had to use the burner much more often and the distance they could travel was greatly limited. Wetzel later said he thought they could have traveled another had the balloon remained intact. They made out the border crossing at Rudolphstein on the A9 and saw the search lights. When the propane ran out they descended quickly, landing near the town of Naila, in the West German state of Bavaria and only from the border. The only injury was suffered by Wetzel, who broke his leg upon landing. They thought they had made it as they had seen red and yellow colored lights which were not common in East Germany. They also saw small farms, different than the large state-run operations in the east. Another clue was modern farm equipment that was unlike older equipment that was used in East Germany. Two Bavarian State Police officers saw the balloon's flickering light and headed to where they thought it would land and found Strelzyk and Wetzel who first asked if they had made it to the west, although they noticed the police car was an Audi ‚Äì another sign they were in West Germany. Upon learning they had, they happily called for their families to join them. Aftermath The families decided to initially settle in Naila where they landed. Wetzel worked as an automobile mechanic and Strelzyk opened a TV repair shop in Bad Kissingen. Due to pressure on them from Stasi spies, the Strelzyks moved to Switzerland in 1985. After the German reunification in 1990, they returned to their hometown of P√∂√üneck and to their old home there. The Wetzels remained in Bavaria. The West German weekly magazine Stern paid Strelzyk and Wetzel for exclusive rights to the story. East Germany immediately increased border security, closed all small airports close to the border, and ordered the planes kept farther inland. Propane gas tanks became registered products and large quantities of fabric suitable for balloon construction could no longer be purchased. Mail from East Germany to the families was prohibited. Erich Strelzyk learned of his brother's escape on the ZDF news and was arrested three hours after the landing in his Potsdam apartment. The arrest of family members was standard procedure to deter others from attempting escape. He was charged with \\"aiding and abetting escape\\" as were Strelzyk's sister Maria and her husband who were sentenced to 2¬Ω years. The three were eventually released with the help of Amnesty International. The escape has been portrayed in two films: Night Crossing (1982) and Ballon (2018). The former, also called With the Wind to the West - the English translation of the German title, was an English- language film produced by Disney. The Strelzyks were reportedly \\"moved to tears\\" at the screening of the movie at Rockefeller Center in New York City. The latter was a German-language production which \\"both families welcomed [Director] Herbig‚Äôs desire to, as he put it, 'make a German film for an international audience.'\\" Herbig said in 2018 that both the Strelzeyk and Wetzel families were dissatisfied with the Disney film. Peter Strelzyk died in 2017 at age 74 after a long illness. In 2017, the balloon was put on permanent exhibition at the Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte: Museum.

Pastells through correspondence. They argued about many things including the concept of God. Jose_rizal_01.jpgDr. Jose Rizal Nietzsche1882.jpgFriedrich Nietzsche Based on the letters Dr. Rizal wrote, it can be said that his concept of God could be summarized into three (3) notions. First, he believed that God existed. Second, he believed that God was Plus Supra. Lastly, he believed that God was the origin of nature; that is, nature was the expression of God. As regards the first notion, Dr. Rizal made explicit that he believed that God existed. He was convinced that a supernatural power behind all of creation had to exist. He says to Fr. Pastells, \\"We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God: how can I doubt it when I am convinced of my own existence? Who recognizes the effect recognizes the cause.\\" It was clear that Dr. Rizal subscribed to the idea of \\"necessary-contingent beings\\" where the contingent being needed other beings for it to exist while the necessary being existed on its own. As such, the necessary being becomes the origin of contingent beings. This necessary being has been labelled by many as \\"God.\\" Dr. Rizal considered himself as a contingent being that needed other beings to sustain his existence. Such other beings included the origin of all; the necessary being, God. He accepted that he was part of the whole of creation. He could not deny himself. Hence, he could not deny creation. As such, he could not deny God. As regards the second notion, Dr. Rizal argued that his God was not like the God of the Catholics, as his God was far above such things. He says to Fr. Pastells, \\"In the conviction that I find myself before the Supreme Problem, which confused voices desire to explain to me, I cannot but answer: 'That may be so; but the God that I surmise is much greater, much better: Plus Supra!\\" He thought that a requirement to the Godliness of God was His being above all things, which meant His being incomprehensible. Dr. Rizal was clearly not convinced that a sufficient understanding of God that was as powerful and metaphysical as the Supreme Being could be contained in the consciousness of little mortals who have no capacity to understand beyond what was in the words of Nietzsche \\"divined\\" to them. Mortals who were so limited could not have possibly comprehended a limitless being. As such, Dr. Rizal articulated that the only genuine faith was \\"blind faith.\\" In short, the more people tried to explain to him what and who God was, the more he got convinced that they did not know what they were talking about. What Dr. Rizal meant by \\"blind faith\\" was, since it was impossible to comprehend God as He was Plus Supra, he could have only hinged his belief on the fact that \\"God was God.\\" As such, he did not deny nor did he accept the religious explanations of the mortals around him. Blind faith was more of a disposition of philosophy than of religion. It was a disposition where one did not accept and deny despite having a personal conviction. As regards the third notion, Dr. Rizal believed that if one was to \\"understand\\" God, he was going to do well to note that books which others claimed were tools of revelation were not reliable. The reason was books were too removed from actual reality as these were written by people, interpreted by others, rewritten by people, obscured by others, etc. The best way to have an idea of God was through connecting with Him personally, directly and physically through His extensions. These extensions were nature. Dr. Rizal says to Fr. Pastells, \\"I believe in revelation, yes, but in that living revelation of nature which surrounds us everywhere, in that potent voice, eternal, incessant, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal like the Being from which it originates, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can reveal to us better the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom?\\" Clearly, Dr. Rizal's philosophico-religious view on God was well- reflected on. It was a product of competent ratiocination by an \\"Indio\\" whom the Spaniards then undermined. He did not content himself with the teachings he grew up with as a student of Catholic institutions. He explored, rationalized, and argued. He asked questions about faith and the fundamental teachings of the Church. He was however careful not to offend the religious sensibilities of his countrymen. To him, ratiocination was simply a gift from God. To not use it would thus have been offensive to the Giver.

Biography  Sugata received his education with missionaries in Kanto Gakuin University. There he was influenced by listening to hymns and received lessons for piano, violin, music theory and singing. In 1927 he acquired tuberculosis and then concentrated solely on his composition studies. From 1928 he studied with Kosaku Yamada and Kiyoshi Nobutoki, who had studied in Berlin. Nobutoki taught him music theory in the German tradition. In 1931 he began studies with Meiro Sugahara, who believed that German music was not a good model for Japanese composers who wanted to compose in Western style with Japanese sensibility, on the principles of Gagaku, Buddhist music and Kabuki music. He considered French, Italian and Russian music more appropriate for the Japanese mentality, because it offers more flexible sounds by using Whole tone and Japanese scales. Sugahara gave the advice to Sugata that composers such as Shiro Fukai were better than the works of Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Igor Stravinsky, Ottorino Respighi and Darius Milhaud to study. As a result, Sugata wrote two major orchestral works in a style that can be described as \\"Oriental Stravinsky\\", namely \\"Yokohama\\" (1932) and \\"Symphonic Fantasia\\" SAKURA \\"(Cherry Blossoms)\\" (1933). In 1933 he returned to German-tinted music and studied with Klaus Pringsheim Sr., A teacher in the neoclassical style and a former pupil of Gustav Mahler, who at the time was a professor at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. From then on he studied German music from Johann Sebastian Bach to Paul Hindemith and was interested in Arnold Schoenberg and his atonal music. In 1935 his piece Japanese Picture Scroll, won a composition competition held by the Imperial Household Agency. The following year he also won a competition held by the (NHK) with his work Festive Prelude. During the Second World War he left for Tanuma, where his grandparents lived. He wanted to compose further, but his illness made working difficult for him. He died on 5 July 1952. Most of his works were not published and his manuscripts were forgotten in their house in Tanuma. It was only in 1999 the manuscripts were found again and received public attention.

Starring Ray McAnally, the series was first screened on Channel 4 and won Bafta and Emmy awards, and was screened in more than 30 countries. The 2012 four-part Channel 4 series Secret State was \\"inspired\\" by the same novel. It starred Gabriel Byrne and was written by Robert Jones. Plot Harry Perkins, an unassuming, working class, very left- wing Leader of the Labour Party and Member of Parliament for Sheffield Central, becomes Prime Minister in March 1991. The priorities of the Perkins Government include dissolving all newspaper monopolies, withdrawal from NATO, removing all American military bases on UK soil, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and true open government. Newspaper magnate Sir George Fison, with allies within British political and civil service circles, moves immediately to discredit him, with the United States the key, but covert, conspirator. The most effective of the Prime Minister's domestic enemies is the aristocratic Sir Percy Browne, Head of MI5, whose ancestors \\"unto the Middle Ages\\" have exercised subtle power behind the scenes. However Harry finds support in Joan Cook, a loyal Member of Parliament (MP) and Home Secretary; and Thompson, Perkins' Press Secretary; Inspector Page, his Head of Security and Sir Montague Kowalski, the Government Chief Scientific Adviser. It provides an intimate view of the machinations of a particularly British political conspiracy. The series is set in 1991 and 1992, which was then the near future from when it was made (1988), with a King as the British monarch (the royal cypher on one of the Prime Minister's red boxes is shown as \\"C III R,\\" suggesting that the monarch is Charles III, the current Prince of Wales). The 1991 and 1992 dates can be clearly seen on several newspapers and car tax discs shown on screen.

In the novel, the Prime Minister is forced from office following a catastrophic nuclear accident at an experimental nuclear plant that he had pushed for while Secretary of State for Energy in a previous government. This is the most explicit parallel between Harry Perkins and Tony Benn who was in the post from 1975 to 1979. In the TV version, the Prime Minister is presented with forged evidence of financial irregularity following a short-lived affair years previously; with the suggestion that he should resign rather than see the story made public. He agrees to make a resignation speech on live television, but instead announces the attempted blackmail and calls for a new election. Senior Army officers and security service officials watch in silence. The final sequence, on the morning of the election, is deliberately ambiguous, but implies that a military coup has begun.

It was directed by Brenda Laurel.  Production  Five years of research were spent on the game. During this time, Laurel discovered that boys and girls play games differently, and that girls wanted a more slower-paced and introspective experience as opposed to the action-based twitch gameplay that appealed to boys. A website launch and a serious media hype preceded the release of Purple Moon's first two titles: Rockett's New School and Secret Paths. Two 30-second TV spots for the games were aired on network and cable stations in New York and Chicago in October-November 1997. Rockett even appeared with a mustache in the \\"Got Milk?\\" ad series. The game was conceived as part of an episodic series of CD-ROMS, with unresolved plot elements that would be addressed in the following titles. Episode 2, Rockett's Tricky Decision, was expected to come out in January 1998. The game's success led to a website, merchandise, and talks about a television adaption. Mattel bought Purple Moon in 1999 in order to add the Rockett brand to their success girl's video gaming empire that had begun with Barbie. Mattel aimed to expand the franchise with a book series. Another game entitled Starfire Soccer Challenge was not serialised due to the imminent acquisition of the company by Mattel.  Gameplay and design  The game follows Rockett Movado as she begins the first day of eighth grade at her new school. The game's genre is \\"friendship adventures for girls\\", which Wired deemed to be a new game category created by Brenda Laurel, Purple Moon's co-founder. The game's design was built on the notion of girls not wanting to play as a superhero, rather as a friend, experiencing real-life events, encounters, and emotions that they would understand. The player can discover more about each player by examining their locker or reading their journal, which allowed each character more three-dimensionality than in traditional hero vs villain games. The game avoids text when it can and instead portrays information through graphical imagery, in order to help players identify with the protagonist by seeing what she sees. In the sequel, Rockett's Tricky Decision, Rockett is invited to two parties on the same night.  Critical reception  The first Christmas sell- in exceeded the developer's expectations, and the press coverage was 95 percent positive. During December 1997 alone, Rockett's New School sold 39,174 units in the United States, for revenues of $1.1 million. It ultimately sold 250,000 units. However, a New York Times review commented that he didn't need to play the game with young girls because he knew a bad game when he saw it, which was reprinted in a popular Silicon Valley newspaper San Jose Mercury News. The title became attacked by both reviewers (who felt it was objectively a poor game) and feminists (who felt it was a bad example of what a \\"game for girls\\" could be). Entertainment Weekly described the title as \\"thoughtfully addictive\\". CNN asserts that while successful, the games never \\"became the runaway hits the company hoped they would be\\". Superkids felt the title was the first step in a new genre of video gaming, though noted it posed morally ambiguous conundrums, such as whether to read some else's journal. In a retrospective review, Buzzfeed called the title \\"The Mean Girls Of '90s Games\\". Laurel herself asserts that girls found a community within the game.

The products are mainly specialty papers such as cigarette paper, banknotes and technical filter papers. Compared to wood pulp, hemp pulp offers a four to five times longer fibre, a significantly lower lignin fraction as well as a higher tear resistance and tensile strength. Because the paper industry's processes have been optimized for wood as the feedstock, production costs currently are much higher than for paper from wood.  History  Wrapping paper with hemp fiber excavated from the Han Tomb of Wu Di (140-87 BC) at Baqiao, Xi'An The first identified coarse paper, made from hemp, dates to the early Western Han Dynasty, 200 years before the nominal invention of papermaking by Cai Lun, who improved and standardized paper production using a range of inexpensive materials, including hemp ends, around 2000 years ago. Recycled hemp clothing, rags, and fishing nets were used as inputs for paper production.Clarke p. 188 By the sixth century AD, the papermaking process spread to Korea, where cannabis had been used previously for thousands of years, and Japan, where cannabis had been used for 10,000 years.Clarke p. 187 =Early Western use= Hemp paper only reached Europe in the 13th century via the Middle East. In Germany it was used for the first time in the 14th century. It was not until the 19th century that methods were established for the production of paper from wood pulp, which were cheaper than the hemp paper production and, above all, repressed in the area of writing and printing papers. Notably, the first copies of the Bible were made of hemp paper. The Saint Petersburg, Russia, paper mill of Goznak opened in 1818. It used hemp as its main input material. Paper from the mill was used in the printing of \\"bank notes, stamped paper, credit bills, postal stamps, bonds, stocks, and other watermarked paper.\\"A brief history of the St. Petersburg Paper Mill of Goznak (www.goznak.spb.ru) =20th century= In 1916, U.S. Department of Agriculture chief scientists Lyster Hoxie Dewey and Jason L.

A later book about hemp and other fibers by the same L.H. Dewey(1943) have no words about hemp as a raw material for production of paper.

The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase, but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp. After the Second World War, industrial hemp was only grown on micro-plots. Although the industrial hemp bred in the 1950s and 1960s is harmless because of the almost complete absence of THC, cultivation has been banned in many countries in recent decades. In Germany, growing hemp was completely prohibited between 1982 and 1995 by the Bet√§ubungsmittelgesetz (Narcotics Act, the national controlled- substances law) in order to prevent the illegal use of cannabis as a narcotic. Especially in France, the varieties of hemp used for the manufacture of cigarette paper were still in use and grown (see Hemp in France). As of 1994, most of the French hemp crop was used to make rolling paper, currency, and high quality paper for Bibles (India paper). Fiber sources Before the industrialisation of paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers. Contemporary Currently there is a small niche market for hemp pulp, for example as cigarette paper. Hemp fiber is mixed with fiber from other sources than hemp. In 1994 there was no significant production of 100% true hemp paper. World hemp pulp production was believed to be around 120,000 tons per year in 1991 which was about 0.05% of the world's annual pulp production volume. The total world production of hemp fiber had in 2003 declined to about 60,000 from 80,000 tons. This can be compared to a typical pulp mill for wood fiber, which is never smaller than 250,000 tons per annum. The cost of hemp pulp is approximately six times that of wood pulp, mostly because of the small size and outdated equipment of the few hemp processing plants in the Western world, and because hemp is harvested once a year (during August) and needs to be stored to feed the mill the whole year through. This storage requires a lot of (mostly manual) handling of the bulky stalk bundles. Another issue is that the entire hemp plant cannot be economically prepared for paper production. While the wood products industry uses nearly 100% of the fiber from harvested trees, only about 25% of the dried hemp stem‚Äîthe bark, called bast‚Äîcontains the long, strong fibers desirable for paper production. All this accounts for a high raw material cost. Hemp pulp is bleached with hydrogen peroxide, a process today also commonly used for wood pulp. =Market share= The use of hemp fiber for paper production represented 90% of the (legal) use of hemp in Europe at the end of the 1990s, with the release of the cultivation of industrial hemp in other parts of Europe in recent years, the share of the increase in other types of use (textiles, natural fiber reinforced plastics) is currently around 70 to 80% and is still the most important hemp product line in Europe. Today, hemp is used for cigarette paper among other things in Spain and in United Kingdom.Carus et al. (2008) Around the year 2000, the production volume for flax and hemp pulp totalled 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year, which was produced from about 37,000 to 45,000 tonnes of fibers. Up to 80% of the produced pulp is used for specialty papers (including 95% cigarette paper). Only about 20% goes into the standard pulp area and are here in mostly lower quality wood pulp (unpurified tow with high hurd content). In the case of hemp pulp alone, the proportion of specialty papers is probably around 99%. The market is considered to be saturated, so no or only low growth in this area is predicted.Ivan B√≥csa, Michael Karus, Daike Lohmeyer: The cultivation of hemp.

Edition, 2003, page 79 =Costs= Production costs are about four times higher than for paper from wood since the infrastructure for using hemp is underdeveloped. For the most part, hemp paper is used for specialty applications and not for mass applications such as printing, writing and packaging paper. If the paper industry were to switch from wood to hemp for sourcing its cellulose fibers, the following benefits could be utilized to offset the cost differential: * Hemp yields three to four times more usable fibre per hectare per annum than forests, and hemp doesn't need pesticides or herbicides. * Hemp has a much faster crop yield. It takes about 3-4 months for hemp stalks to reach maturity, while trees can take between 20 to 80 years. Not only does hemp grow at a faster rate, but it also contains a high level of cellulose. This quick return means that paper can be produced at a faster rate if hemp were used in place of wood. * Hemp paper does not require the use of toxic bleaching or as many chemicals as wood pulp because it can be whitened with hydrogen peroxide. This means using hemp instead of wood for paper would end the practice of poisoning Earth's waterways with chlorine or dioxins from wood paper manufacturing. * Hemp paper can be recycled up to 8 times, compared to just 3 times for paper made from wood pulp. * Compared to its wood pulp counterpart, paper from hemp fibers resists decomposition and does not yellow or brown with age. It is also one of the strongest natural fibers in the world \\\\- one of the reasons for its longevity and durability. * Several factors favor the increased use of wood substitutes for paper, especially agricultural fibers such as hemp. Deforestation, particularly the destruction of old growth forests, and the world‚Äôs decreasing supply of wild timber resources are today major ecological concerns. Hemp's use as a wood substitute will contribute to preserving biodiversity. In 2019, Cornish Hemp Company, Quintessential Tips created the world's first consumable product with its packaging made from hemp paper, thus beginning the change from standard packaging materials to hemp.

It was established in 1890 as Monitore Zoologico Italiano, obtaining its current name in 1989, with volume numbering restarted at 1. It is published by Taylor & Francis and the editor-in-chief is Alberto Ugolini (University of Florence). A brief history Volumes of the journal Front page of a volume of the journal The journal was established in 1890 by Giulio Chiarugi and Eugenio Ficalbi (who edited it until 1922) as the Monitore Zoologico Italiano. From the start, a specific interest is declared for zoology, anatomy, and embryology. The Unione Zoologica Italiana was founded in 1900 and in the same year the Monitore became its official journal. In 1923 Ficalbi was succeeded by Angelo Senna. From 1930 to 1933 the journal also became the official journal of the Societ√† Italiana di Anatomia. Since 1934 it is no longer the organ of the Unione Zoologica Italiana and from 1934 to 1966 it is only the organ of the Societ√† Italiana di Anatomia of which the proceedings of the conferences are published. Until 1943 it was edited by Chiarugi and Senna. In 1944 Giuseppe Colosi took over and edited the journal until 1967. In addition to Colosi, in 1946 Nello Beccari and Senna joined as editors. In 1951 Ignazio Fazzari replaced Senna. From 1957 on, the editors were Colosi, Fazzari, and Emanuele Padoa. In 1962 Leo Pardi also became part of the editorial committee. In 1967, under the direction of Pardi, the Monitore was published every three months, in English, with the advice of an international advisory board and with the subtitle of Italian Journal of Zoology,http://www.uzionlus.it/documenti/UZI-Italiano.pdf and was mainly addressed to Zoology and Ethology. In 1967 the number of directors rises to 6 with the entry of Alberto Monroy and Floriano Papi. In 1968 and 1970 Valdo Mazzi and Baccio Baccetti join the editorial committee. In 1975, Colosi dies. In 1982, the directors are Pardi, Papi, Baccetti, Fazzari and Antonio Ercolini. In 1985 Fazzari is no longer in the group of directors. Since 1967, an annual Supplement of the Monitore has been published in relation to the development of zoology research in tropical areas (in particular Somalia following the foundation of the Centro di Studio per la Faunistica ed Ecologia Tropicali del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, directed by Pardi) The publication of the Supplement will last until 1987, becoming independent magazine since 1988, with the name of Tropical Zoology. Starting from 1975 the Monitore Zoologico Italiano publishes a series of monographs focusing on themes of parasitology, herpetology, and ethology. Since 1989 the Monitore becomes Ethology Ecology & Evolution, editor Francesco Dess√¨‚ÄìFulgheri. From 2010 it is published by Taylor & Francis. In 2015 Alberto Ugolini became editor-in-chief.

Through his research, Carnoy has argued that educational policy is used by capitalist nations' \\"bourgeois elites\\" as a form of cultural imperialism in order to perpetuate the conditions allowing for the exploitation of working classes both within and without these nations through e.g. education systems that support inherited advantages (Education as Cultural Imperialism, 1974).Bowman, M.

He has chronicled how Marxist views on the role of the state shifted considerably throughout the 20th century, sometimes bearing little loyalty to the original views of Karl Marx (The State and Political Theory, 1984).Ikenberry, G.J. (1986). Review of The State and Political Theory by Martin Carnoy. American Journal of Sociology, 91(6), pp. 1246‚Äì1247. Dr. Carnoy also has explored how Cuba leverages small, personalized schools, highly trained teachers, strong principals, a coherent curriculum and long-term relationships between teachers and students to academically outperform most other Latin American countries (Cuba's Academic Advantage, 2007).Carnoy, M.

Comparative Education Review, 53(1), pp. 147‚Äì149. Together with Luis Beneviste and Richard Rothstein, Carnoy has weighed in on the debate between private and public education, arguing that many private schools in inner cities face the same problems as their neighboring public schools and thus questioning the extent to which they can be part of the solution.Beneviste, L., Carnoy, M., Rothstein, R. (2003). All Else Equal: Are Public and Private Schools Different? New York: Routledge. Similarly, Carnoy, Rothstein, Lawrence Mishel and Rebecca Jacobsen have contributed to the debate on charter schools through their book The Charter School Dust-Up, wherein they compare student enrollment and achievement in charter and public schools and explain the finding that students in the later tend on average to academically outperform students in the former.Carnoy, M., Jacobsen, R., Mishel, L., Rothstein, R. (2005). The Charter School Dust-Up. Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute. Carnoy has conducted research on the impact of school accountability on learning, the effectiveness and efficiency of private schools, the impact of globalization on education systems,Carnoy, M., Rhoten, D.

(1995). Structural adjustment and the changing face of education. International Labour Review, 134(6). Key findings of Carnoy's research include: * Students in U.S. states with high school accountability averaged significantly higher gains on the National Assessment of Educational Progress 8th-grade math tests compared to students in states with little or no school accountability, though there is no significant effect on student retention or high school completion rates (with Susanna Loeb).Carnoy, M., Loeb, S. (2002). Does External Accountability Affect Student Outcomes? A Cross-State Analysis. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 24(4), pp. 305-331. * In Chile, Catholic private schools are more effective with regard to education provision than public schools and non-religious private schools, whereas the relationship is reversed with regard to efficiency (with Patrick J. McEwan).McEwan, P.J., Carnoy, M. (2000). The Effectiveness and Efficiency of Private Schools in Chile's Voucher System. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 22(3), pp. 213‚Äì239. * The effectiveness of the implementation of school voucher systems, e.g. in Sweden and Chile, in terms of improving learning outcomes depends critically on the socioeconomic characteristics of their beneficiaries; importantly, its impact on public education is mediated through the expectations and regard a society has for public education (e.g. high in Sweden and low in Chile).Carnoy, M.

The Cambridge Central Mosque was opened to the public on 24 April 2019. Two-thirds of the mosque's funding came from Turkey.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-48044025  Background  Detail of column and ceiling The Muslim Academic Trust (MAT) proposed the site location to be situated in the Romsey area of Mill Road in Cambridge. Thereafter, the Cambridge Mosque Project was established in 2008 by Dr Timothy Winter, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Cambridge, to raise funds for the project. After the ¬£4m purchase of a one- acre site in 2009 on Mill Road, Marks Barfield Architects was appointed to design the new mosque in association with Professor Keith Critchlow, a world leading expert in sacred architecture and Islamic geometry along with the UK's leading Islamic garden designer Emma Clark. Marks Barfield Architects are known for innovative designs such as the London Eye and Kew Gardens Treetop Walk, to name a few. Plans for the mosque were submitted to the Cambridge City Council by the MAT and it was approved by the council in 2012. The project however was controversial and it was met with objections. With its emphasis on sustainability and high reliance on green energy, the mosque will be Europe's first eco-mosque. In addition to the mosque's dedicated areas (ablution, teaching, children's area, morgue) there will be a caf√©, teaching area and meeting rooms for use by the local Muslim and non-Muslim communities and will accommodate up to 1000 worshippers. Donors from Europe, Middle East, Asia and the Americas have supported the project, but most of the donations, around two-thirds of the total, have come from Turkey. Construction started in September 2016, was completed in March 2019, and the mosque opened to the public on 24 April 2019.

Progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether is closely related to quingestrone, which is also known as progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether and was formerly marketed as an oral contraceptive. The 3-acetyl ether may be cleaved from progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether in vivo and, based on its chemical structure, this may result in the transformation of progesterone 3-acetyl enol ether into 3Œ±-dihydroprogesterone and/or 3Œ≤-dihydroprogesterone. 3Œ≤-Dihydroprogesterone has been reported to possess about the same progestogenic potency as progesterone in the Clauberg test, whereas 3Œ±-dihydroprogesterone was not assessed.

History  Wi- Charge was founded in 2012 by Victor Vaisleib, Ori Mor and Ortal Alpert. The company is developing a unique far-field wireless power technology based on infrared laser beams. In 2015, Wi-Charge demonstrated its first prototype capable of charging small electronic devices. In 2017, the company claimed to obtain compliance with international safety standards. During CES 2018, Wi- Charge demonstrated simultaneous charging of multiple devices from a single transmitter.  Technology  Wi-Charge claims to deliver power using focused beams of invisible infrared light. The system consists of a transmitter and a receiver. Transmitter connects to a standard power outlet and converts electricity into infrared laser beam. Receivers use a miniature photo-voltaic cell to convert transmitted light into electrical power. Receivers can be embedded into a device or connected into an existing charging port. The transmitter automatically identifies chargeable receivers and start charging. Several devices can charge at the same time. According to Wi-Charge it can deliver several watts of power to a device at several meters away. The core technology is based on a distributed laser resonator which is formed by the retroreflectors within the transmitter and the receiver. This unique concept allows the charging of multiple devices without any moving components and if an opaque object enters one of the beams the corresponding power transfer is turned off automatically. A schematic description of typical wireless power transfer using a laser beam. A transmitter converts electricity into a light beam and a receiver on the other side converts the light back to electricity.  Safety  Because laser power in the single-digit watt range is used for energy transmission, ensuring product safety is crucial. Wi-Charge has stated that its technology complies with the IEC 60825-1 International Safety Standard (laser safety). According to this standard it is a Class 1 product. > \\"Class 1: Lasers that are safe under reasonably foreseeable conditions of > operation, including the use of optical instruments for intrabeam viewing.\\" In April 2019 the company announced that it has earned UL safety approval. According to Wi-Charge, the system transmits power using a straight, narrow beam. The beam is contained into a small spot and all the energy falls inside the receiver. Therefore, nobody is exposed to radiated energy as long as the path between the transmitter and the receiver is not crossed. If the path between transmitter and receiver is blocked, transmission stops immediately. Once line of sight is restored, charging resumes. Wi-Charge claims that this mechanism ensures that energy exposure to people, animals or unrelated objects is always below the maximum permissible exposure (MPE): > \\"Sending energy over a distance, a beam always diverges, which is a bad > thing as too little power is going in the right direction, and too much > power splits and goes elsewhere. With RF, only relatively humble distances > can be achieved, with a power capacity about a fraction of a Watt, limited > by the maximum level of exposure allowed for safety. Shorter wavelength > beams maintain their integrity better. With an infrared laser, we have a > practically non-diverging beam able to deliver its entire power content onto > a small receiver\\"  Limitations and Advantages  Some consider the necessity of a direct line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver to be a disadvantage of using laser to deliver power is. So, devices that are hidden (such as smartphone in your pocket or medical implant) cannot be charged using this technology. However, some see line of sight as an advantage because when line of sight is not used, there is potential for greater leakage of undesired energy into the environment, and there is full control over where the energy is going. Companies that integrate Wi-Charge usually embed a rechargeable battery or super-capacitor in their products. This allows to both overcome periods where new charge is not received, as well as to deliver momentary larger bursts of energy than the average charging rate. Wi-Charge does claim that using infrared light for long-range wireless power has advantages over using radio frequency or ultrasound because of two main reasons: * Physics. Because of their very short wavelength, infrared beams diverge (see Diffraction) much less than technologies with longer wavelengths. This means that the diameter of the beam can remain small at a distance from the power transmitter. Thus, a receiver of small physical size can still capture all or most of the light energy. * Safety. The allowable Specific absorption rate imposes stronger limits on radio frequency and ultrasound energy transmission.

Eleven trains were involved. Passengers abandoned five of the trains due to issues including a lack of communication, heating and toilets. No injuries were reported. Network Rail and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch conducted investigations into the incident. Previous strandings =Huntingdon= In June 2005, a passenger train became stranded near for two hours. Conditions quickly became uncomfortable for the passengers on board. The Rail Safety and Standards Board subsequently conducted research into conditions on a stranded train with inoperable air conditioning. It concluded that conditions would become uncomfortable after 40‚Äì50 minutes, and intolerable after 70‚Äì90 minutes. Opening doors on the train would mean that conditions would be tolerable for up to five hours. =Aviemore= On 31 March 2010, a passenger train became stranded in snow between and Slochd, Highland. More than 100 passengers had to be rescued. =Foxton= In October 2010, a passenger train operated by First Capital Connect (FCC) became stranded at . The incident occurred at 16:44 hours. Conditions on board rapidly deteriorated, with temperatures reaching . Some passengers abandoned the train after 60 minutes, others broke windows after 2 hours. Passengers were rescued by using another service train drawing up alongside the broken down train, but it could only take 100 of the 375 passengers. A second train rescued the remaining passengers at 20:20. =Orpington= In November 2010, a Southeastern passenger train became stranded near . Passengers remained on the train overnight. =Kentish Town= On 26 May 2011, a passenger train formed of two Class 377 electric multiple units operated by FCC experienced pantograph damage and broke down between Dock Junction and whilst operating a service from to . The train was carrying 472 passengers. It took three hours for the failed train to be rescued. Absence of power meant that throughout this time, air conditioning and toilets on the train were inoperative. After 45 minutes the public address system failed, which prevented the driver from keeping the passengers informed of the situation. They then resorted to breaking windows and forcing doors open in an effort to alleviate their discomfort. The lack of communication caused some passengers to abandon the train and start walking along the track towards nearby Kentish Town station. When the train was eventually moved, and having been authorised to do so, the driver overrode a number of safety systems, leading to the train being moved with at least two doors open whilst passengers were on board. FCC policy at the time was that an evacuation of a train should be considered after 60 minutes and must have commenced within 90 minutes of a stranding. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) investigation found that FCC had failed to implement lessons learned from earlier train strandings. FCC were prosecuted by the Office of Rail and Road for offences under Section 3 (1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and fined ¬£75,000. =South Croydon= On 4 June 2011, a passenger train was brought to a halt near by the emergency braking system following activation of the passenger communication device. Some passengers abandoned the train after 30 minutes. One of them suffered severe burns when she came into contact with the third rail. =Peckham Rye= On 7 November 2017, a Class 378 electric multiple unit became stranded short of station due to a fault causing the brakes to lock on. About 80 of the 450 passengers were evacuated with the third rail still live. No injuries occurred. =Dorset ‚Äì Hampshire border= On 1 March 2018, three passenger trains operated by South Western Railway (SWR) became stranded at , and in Dorset and Hampshire in snowy weather. Weather conditions hampered evacuation of the trains, which was not accomplished until the following morning. Passengers spent up to 14 hours on the stranded trains. Complaints were made of a lack of communication from SWR, a lack of heating and toilet facilities. A train operated by CrossCountry was also stranded in the area. Passengers praised the way CrossCountry staff dealt with the situation. =Haltwhistle= On 1 March 2018, a passenger train became stranded in snow near , Northumberland. Passengers had to be rescued. The incident On 2 March 2018, eleven passenger trains operated by Southeastern became stranded in the , and area in weather conditions of snow and freezing rain. Due to a lack of communication with passengers, a lack of heating and lack of toilets, passengers abandoned five of the nine trains. The eleven trains involved comprised at least 22 electric multiple units. Two of the units had no toilets, and five of the remaining twenty-plus were operating with toilets that were not in service. Four people were treated for minor injuries. =Timeline= ;17:34 Train 2M48 came to a stand after passing Lewisham station, unable to draw power as the third rail was affected by freezing rain.

Criticism There was widespread criticism of the incident and the way it was handled. Southeastern also issued its own criticism of passengers who abandoned trains, describing them as \\"trespassers\\". Rail Magazine criticised Southeastern for swearing in a tweet responding to a query from a passenger on one of the stranded trains. Passengers on board 2M50, which had no toilets and had been held within sight of Lewisham station, complained of the conditions on board. People were wetting and soiling themselves as there was no other option. They also complained that the train was being held in sight of the station and wondered why it could not be cleared into the platform. An investigation by Rail revealed that the driver had asked for such permission, but that the power had been switched off before this could be authorised and arranged. Other passengers complained of a lack of heating and lighting when the power had been cut off. One passenger wrote a detailed account of being stranded on 2M50, describing how conditions deteriorated on board the packed train, and criticising Southeastern for not following Rail Delivery Group guidance in respect of stranded trains, which states that evacuation of a stranded train should be commenced after an hour and completed within two hours. Investigations =Network Rail and Southeastern= Network Rail and Southeastern commissioned consultants Arthur D Little and Southwood Rail Consulting to conduct an investigation into the incident. The report, released on 23 August, was highly critical of Southeastern and Network Rail finding that the rail industry's inadequate procedures were not fully followed, and that communication between the various parties involved did not adequately support effective management of the incident. Seventeen recommendations were made.Lewisham disruption report recommends incident management improvements Railway Gazette International 24 August 2018 =Rail Accident Investigation Branch= The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) opened an investigation into the incident. It published its final report on 25 March 2019. Five recommendations were made and two learning points were identified. The report found that neither train 2M48 been declared as failed, nor had train 2M50 had been declared as stranded. Train 2M48 had difficulty in starting from Lewisham because no de-icing fluid had been applied to the conductor rail since 22:34 on 1 March. De-icing fluid had an effective time of twelve hours. Due to the emergency timetable that had been implemented and late running trains, no train had passed over that section of line for about 90 minutes. No supplementary treatment of the conductor rail had been carried out. The signalling manager at London Bridge Control Centre was not sure that he had the authority to allow train 2M50 to pass signal L445 at danger under permissive working to allow it into the platform at Lewisham when he did have such authority. The decision to allow train 2M50 past signal L253 prevented it from being re-routed once train 2M48 experienced difficulty in starting from Lewisham. The management of the incident by Southeastern was not effective. Passenger communications via Twitter showed that the situation was rapidly deteriorating. There was no strategy to avoid trains being stranded between stations, whereas on the London Underground network, the policy is to hold trains at stations when there is disruption. Response Network Rail and Southeastern issued a joint statement following the release of the RAIB's final report. Amongst measures introduced following the incident were better training for staff, the installation of heated conductor rails in some locations, introduction of more efficient de-icer for the conductor rails, improved radios for staff, the introduction of ice breaking shoes on some electric multiple units.

Mott continued the aerial perspective method used by Richard W. Rummell, the first artist to prepare Turner City, receiving the blueprints months in advance and first making cardboard models of each building on a table to get the scale right. Then, in his studio in a converted garage, with the windows blacked- out, he would photograph the model from a step ladder and draw it in pencil, finishing with an ink wash. The street layout was from Mott's imagination but always different and he included a trademark train in each drawing. Each building was numbered and a key on the reverse gave their real location, apart from during the Second World War when that information was secret. Around 1939, Mott's depiction of the General Motors' Highways and Horizons building for the 1939 New York World's Fair was shown in the company's publicity brochure for the exhibit. He was also a landscape painter and created an aerial view of Skytop Lodge, Pennsylvania, that adjusted the geography to include all the necessary features and was used for decades as the basis of maps used to orientate visitors to the lodge. Death and legacy Mott died in 1962 from complications during surgery. In 1994, Turner Construction donated the Turner City drawings to the National Building Museum.

Construction In 2013 Strategic Marine was awarded the contract to build the 40-metre on-station Long Term Ashmore Capability (LTAC) vessel for Gardline Australia Pty Ltd on behalf of the Government of Australia. The vessel was designed by MMD Naval Architectsto provide border protection services in Australia's northern waters therefore to be reliable and flexibly self-sufficient for longterm deployment in tropical regions. The vessel employs a steel hull with aluminium superstructure. It has medical facilities for first aid along with an isolation facility. Austere accommodation is provided for up to 24 transportees. In addition, sheltered deck space allows for a short term holding capability for 25 additional passengers. The vessel was constructed at the Strategic Marine shipyards in Vung Tau, Vietnam and was launched in March 2014. Operational history The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Scott Morrison, attended a naming ceremony for the vessel at Victoria Quay in Fremantle Harbour on 20 June 2014. He said Thaiyak would significantly improve Australia's capability in the detection and response to maritime threats in Australia's northern waters. The vessel is not armed but carries small arms consisting of Glock pistols for Australian Border Force boarding party officers along with other personal defence equipment on board.

His music is a synthesis of traditional forms such as Tuvan throat singing, Shamanic music, Raga, and pre-Columbian Mexica music and language; with avant garde musical styles like Industrial, Ambient, Noise, and Goth. Likewise, his live performance is a fusion of costume and ritual from Tuva, Mexico, North American Native cultures, and Western Ceremonial Magic traditions; as well as chaos magic, butoh, and modern primitive movements of the 20th century. His lyrics, when there are any, are often written in the Nahuatl or traditional Tuvan languages. He won the title of \\"Best Foreigner\\" at the 2008 Ustuu-Khuree Festival in Chadanaa Tuva, and in that same year placed as \\"Third Laureate\\" at The International Throat Singing Symposium, which remains the highest award given to a non-Tuvan in the history of the Symposium. He also won 2nd Place in the Tuvan Nation Kargyraa Competition in 2014, was given a special award as \\"Great innovator of the art of Tuvan Throat Singing\\" in 2016,, and won Best Kargyraa Performance at the Khoomei in the Center of Asia Festival 2019. As a solo artist, and with various collaborators and musical ensembles, Soriah has toured throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, and Mexico. He is considered the highest-ranked non-native practitioner of Tuvan throat singing. Early life and career Enrique Ugalde was born in San Bernardino, and moved to Oakland CA at a young age. His father was the drummer for a popular rock and roll band in Mexico called Los Sputniks. As a child, he was exposed to traditional Mesoamerican cultures on frequent family trips to Mexico City with his father, and by his Mexican grandmother. He describes himself as having sung and played guitar in a church choir as a child, begun his study of opera and other Western classical singing shortly thereafter, and being inducted into the State of California Honors Chorus in his high school years. His interest in the \\"goth\\" subculture led him to music like Bauhaus, Einsturzende Neubauten, Crash Worship, and Psychic TV; which influenced his shift from classical music to a more experimental and industrial direction. He studied vocal performance at Cal State University Long Beach in 1990 before moving first to Berkeley, then to Oakland. It was in Oakland that he made his first recordings of looped vocals and ambient electronics, which he regards as the roots of the Soriah project. He first invented the name Soriah in early 1995 for the title of a song, \\"The Course of Soriah.\\" This is the name he gave to his \\"timeless essence outside the body.\\" In Oakland, he performed with various industrial and experimental music projects, and was known for hosting illegal \\"Trespass Parties\\" in abandoned factories and shipyards. Ugalde relocated to Portland, Oregon in 1996. There he met and studied the Kirana style of raga with famed instructor Michael Stirling, and encountered throat singing for the first time in recordings and a subsequent live show by Huun Huur Tu. He provided percussion, guitar, and vocals for numerous music and performance projects during the late 90s in Portland included Sumerland, Big Milk Bath, Black Orchid, Feral, PANDrogynous Ad Nauseum, Flail, Mesmer; and the collective known alternately as 2Gyrlz and Pan/Zen. Early Soriah years The first public Soriah performances took place in 1999 in Portland, and he quickly achieved renown in the underground arts and music scene. He describes his circle of friends and artists at that time as \\"neo-tribal.\\" In addition to nightclubs and theaters, early Soriah performances often took place in unconventional locations; such as the underground \\"shanghai tunnels\\" of Portland's Oldtown neighborhood, the ruins of the Sutro Baths in San Francisco, in the midst of a citywide protest against George W. Bush in 2005, buried up to his waist in the earth, and half-submerged in a swamp full of frogs on the campus of Reed College. His costumes vary; but often include white make-up or clay accentuated with black lines and fields of color on the face, large headdresses and wide-brimmed hats, ritual robes, and white tulle that obscures facial and bodily features. During this period, he played with an alternating ensemble of drummers, percussionists, electronic musicians, and dancers including Lana Guerra (aka Power Circus), Stephen Schieberl (aka Let's Go Outside, aka LGO, aka Demogorgon), Ryan Olson, Noah Mickens, Jonathan Howitt, Daniel Henderson, Marshall Serna, Ashkelon Sain, Lucretia Renee, Barrett Clark (aka Sidereal Oscillations), and many others. Recordings Soriah's solo show at The Old Church in Portland featured Soriah accompanying his own vocals on a 20-foot-tall antique pipe organ, and was captured for his first CD release Chao Organica in A Minor (2006, Beta-Lactam Ring Records.) His 2007 follow up release on BLR, Offrendas de Luz a los Muertos, is an extended duet with Lana Guerra playing homemade analog synthesizers that he describes as being his most discordant and intense recording, and also as a \\"sonic exorcism.\\" A recording from Soriah's 2007 appearance on Bay Area radio station KFJC was released as Marakame on Mexican label Ruido Horrible the following year. In 2009, Soriah signed to Projekt Records and co-produced an album called Atlan with Ashkelon Sain of Trance to the Sun, assembling a group of musicians who would form the core of his live ensemble for the next several years (Jonathan Howitt, Daniel Henderson, and Marshall Serna.) He describes this as a return to his roots in both classical and gothic music, after the previous two noise-industrial oriented releases. This ensemble has toured extensively, eventually releasing a second Soriah/Sain album called Eztica in 2011. A number of Soriah recordings have been self-released in digital form since then; including Asterism with Barrett Clark (aka Sidereal Oscillations), Wonderful Disease ‚Äì The Best of Soriah and LGO, and several others. Soriah at Kh√∂√∂mei Ovaa, Aldan Bylak, Tuva Tuva and Uger Khan Ugalde first trained with Tuvan masters Chirgilchin at an intensive camp in Sebastapol, California in 2005. They invited him to attend the first International Throat Singing Camp in Tuva in 2007; and he returned in 2008 to participate in the Ustuu- Khuree Festival, where he was awarded the title of \\"Best Foreigner.\\" He is the only non-Tuvan to have ever placed in the overall competition. From that point onward, he would split his time as much as possible between Tuva and the US. He has appeared on Tuvan television, taught at a youth music school in the city of Kyzyl, and performed traditional music throughout the country. Aldar Tamdyn, the Tuvan Minister of Culture, granted him the name \\"Uger Khan,\\" which translates roughly as \\"Milky Way King.\\" He released an album of traditional Tuvan music under this name in 2013 on Khai-Aat Music, called \\"Tergiinner Yryzy\\" or \\"Songs of the Masters.\\" Since then, he uses Uger Khan to denote his strictly traditional concerts and recordings; and Soriah for his more experimental world fusion music. Soriah performing with Liberation Movement at Lucidity Festival 2018 Festival appearances Soriah has had a presence on the West Coast festival scene for many years and in many forms, including many appearances with the project Liberation Movement. Soriah has performed at The Autonomous Mutant Festival, Burning Man, How to Destroy the Universe, Wave Gotik Treffen in Leipzig Germany 2013 , Oregon Eclipse Gathering 2017, and The Symbiosis Gathering. Collaborations Throughout his career, Soriah has maintained a close relationship with the radical arts non-profit 2Gyrlz and the related Pan-Zen Konspiracy Nett-Wyrk. He performed in the 2Gyrlz-produced EnterActive Language Festival in every year of its existence from 2002 to 2005, and in their How to Destroy the Universe event in 2006; and dozens of other shows. Their collaboration has continued with shows in the United Kingdom in 2010, 2011, and 2013. In addition to those mentioned previously in this article, Soriah has performed or recorded with: Peter Murphy,Liberation Movement, SORNE, Bad Unkl Sista; David J, Dead Voices on Air, Lustmord, Thor & Friends; King Black Acid; Chirgilchin, Societas Insomnia, Bogville, Synchronicity Frequency; cEvin Key, Modest Mouse, The Dandy Warhols, Nachyn and Shonchalai Choduu; Terry Riley, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Perry Farrel, Mesmer, Mandible Chatter, Akira Kasai, Blixa Bargeld, The Living Jarboe, Psychic TV, Scott Kelly, F-Space, Chrome, Waldteufel, GWAR, Extra Action Marching Band, The Polyphonic Spree, MarchFourth Marching Band, Trance to the Sun, Huun Huur Tu, Chirgilchin, Alash, Yat-Kha, Download, The Dresden Dolls, Everyone Orchestra, P.A.N., Submarine Fleet, ¬°Tchkung!, To-Ka-Ge, Sardonik Grin, Death Posture, Children of Paradise, Michael Sakamoto, Yakuza, Riververb, Hop-Frog, Legerdemain, The Moe!kestra!, Degenerate Art Ensemble, Serpentine, The Red King, CoRE, Aixela, and Venerable Showers of Beauty Gamelan.

Personal life Enrique Ugalde has a son in Tuva, also named Enrique Ugalde, with a woman named Jamilya Oorzhak. He is a well-known public figure in Portland; where he has often won karaoke contests and awards for Most Popular Cab Driver. He drives for worker-owned local company Radio Cab. He sings and plays guitar in a David Bowie cover band called Blackstar Rising and a Cure cover band called The Xploding Boys, and occasionally performs as pirate character Captain Bootybeard.

History Trade unionists in Queensland had begun attempting to secure parliamentary representation as early as the mid-1880s. William McNaughton Galloway, the president of the Seamen's Union, mounted an unsuccessful campaign as an independent in an 1886 by-election. A Workers' Political Reform Association was founded to nominate candidates for the 1888 election, at which the Brisbane Trades and Labor Council endorsed six candidates. Thomas Glassey won the seat of Bundamba at that election, becoming the first self-identified \\"labor\\" MP in Queensland. The Queensland Provincial Council of the Australian Labor Federation was formed in 1889 in an attempt to unite Labor campaign efforts. Tommy Ryan won the seat of Barcoo for the labour movement-run People's Parliamentary Association in 1892, and the Labor Party was formally established in Queensland following the first Labor-in-Politics Convention later that year. The Queensland branch subsequently formed the first Labor government in Australia, albeit briefly, when Anderson Dawson took office for a week in 1899 after a falling out between the non-Labor forces. Since 1989 when the party came back to power after 32 years in Opposition all its leaders have become Premiers despite two spells in Opposition in 1996-98 and 2012-2015.

She spent two years of the war in prison, in one case being tortured for 28 days. She was awaiting execution by the Gestapo in September 1944 but was saved by Allied soldiers who drove away her captors. As a result of her actions and \\"acts of great bravery\\", she was awarded medals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Fraser married a British soldier in 1919 after he served in the First World War. They settled in Arras, France. Second World War The start of the war saw Fraser running a perfume shop in Arras. She and her husband stayed in France when the Germans invaded in May 1940. Since he was British, he was interned soon after the invasion. Fraser soon created her own underground network to smuggle out British and other allied airmen who had been shot down. The Special Operations Executive, otherwise known as the SOE, was the British organisation that was tasked to conduct espionage, sabotage and reconnaissance in occupied Europe. With the success of her network, Fraser was approached by SOE agents for help. Continuing her role in smuggling airmen to safety, she also helped agents move about in Northern France. In addition, she stored explosives and weapons for the resistance, helped provide intelligence on German positions and movements, and carried messages. She was noted for doing any task that was asked of her. She was arrested in 1941 and sent to prison in Belgium. During her interrogation, she started providing misleading information that seemed true enough that the Gestapo had to check out the details. In December 1942, after 15 months, she was released as she was considered a \\"burden on resources\\". She quickly resumed her previous activities. She helped F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas, celebrated agent of the SOE, escape by hiding him in a hearse during a mock funeral to evade detection. Flowers around the coffin covered Yeo-Thomas as he was taken to an empty field that was large enough to land a plane to pick him up. The local undertaker provided flowers and steaks to add to the illusion that a funeral was happening. Armed farmers and resistance fighters, their protection arranged by Fraser, guarded the field. Before Yeo-Thomas left, he was provided with wine, cheese, and other products they feared were not available in Britain. The resistance, in return, asked for weapons, and other items that they could use for their operations. Yeo-Thomas was carrying details of the V1 and V2 rocket program with him. Fraser was captured again in February 1944, after being betrayed by a British agent. She was tortured for 28 days and locked in solitary confinement for six months. The Gestapo wanted her to provide details about her activities and other members of the resistance. By May 1944 she had been sentenced to be executed, but was saved by Allied soldiers who freed her from the prison. After the war  Fraser was awarded seven medals from several allied countries after the war. In 1990, the Imperial War Museum purchased her medals for $28,500. Fraser died in 1956. She never fully recovered from her month-long torture.

He made his mark in architectural conservation and the design of new buildings, taking his roots from the vernacular architecture of South India. He is known for designing structures which are built from natural materials such as timber, stone and brick. He has practiced mostly in Chennai and Kerala. He runs a consultancy firm in Chennai. Early life and education Kuriakose was born in Koothattukulam and brought up in Thiruvananthapuram. There he attended the Government Model High School before joining the Government Arts College for his Pre-Degree course. He then attended the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, where he took a basic degree in Civil Engineering. In 1986, he received the Charles Wallace India Trust Award for a master's degree in Conservation Studies from the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies at the University of York, in the UK. He completed a doctoral degree at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2015. Kuriakose is married to Dr. Milly Mathew and has two children. His son, Kevin is an architect settled in Denmark and Eileen Kuriakose is a medical student. Career In 1984, as a recent graduate of the College of Engineering, Trivandrum, he started practicing architecture after a chance meeting with British-born, Indian architect Laurie Baker. After working with him for nine months, he started his own practice in 1985. During his early career as a self-taught architect, he worked with several organizations such as the Integrated Rural Technology Centre, Palakkad, the Centre of Science and Technology for Rural Development (COSTFORD) and Kerala State Nirmithi Kendra for the development of alternative, low-cost and eco-friendly architecture. From 1985 onwards, he built low-cost houses that mirrored Baker's style, until in 1992 he built the house of actor Mammootty. In 1994, Kuriakose was commissioned by Malayala Manorama to design housing for the village of Banegaon after the 1993 Latur earthquake. He also designed the layout of public and residential buildings in the village of Chapredi for the Earth Quake Rehabilitation Project, Bhuj District, Gujarat State, 2002. He has been visiting faculty at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Management and other architecture schools. Kuriakose was awarded the Inside Outside Designer of the Year 2001 for the weekend retreat in Chennai, and in 2011, the Celebration of Architecture Award from Inside Outside magazine. In 2016, he was conferred with the 2016 Estrade Lifetime Achievement Award (the previous recipient of this honor, in 1980, was Architect Karan Grover). He was also listed as one of the top 10 Indian architects who is harnessing traditional wisdom to build homes of the future. He has written books such as Conserving of Timber Structures in India and Post Tsunami Reconstruction: Manual for Supervisors and Project Staff. He is one of the editors of the book Guidelines for the Preparation of a Heritage Management Plan published by INTACH. Kuriakose has offered his services as a consultant to UNDP, UNESCO, various State Governments and other organizations. He has also presented many papers on Housing, Conservation and Cost‚ÄìEffective Building Techniques in various seminars, conferences and workshops in India and abroad. Architectural Style Dakshinachitra Model House Kuriakose seeks to achieve sustainable architecture through vernacular and traditional practices. He believes in the logic behind vernacular architecture being climate responsive, and using locally available materials to create projects that have a simplistic beauty. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness form the most important factors in arriving at the final design. He tries to explore an architecture that is appropriate to the environment, cost-effective, sustainable and at the same incorporates the principles of vernacular architecture in the modern context. Tradition and heritage is not used as a style, but more as a concept. Vernacular architecture to him is more like a depository of knowledge. Society ad technology has undergone many changes, so it is for architects to look at these and then derive a different kind of vocabulary in architecture. Kuriakose tries to design for the client in such a way that there is constant dialogue between them, each affecting the other in various ways, leading to and influencing the final design of the building. This leads the design to progress and clarify as it is continually revised in the light of the constant and evolving interpretations of the parameters. This leads to a final design that is unique and caters to the user. Kuriakose does not have a style of his own. He thinks the concept is much more important than the style in design. He does not want to impose his ideas onto the buildings he designs. He designs each building according to each one's needs. All his projects look different because each homeowner has preferences and he tries to respond to their aspirations. The location is different, the climate is different, the materials are different and the clients are also different. He thinks that style is very superficial. Vishram on The Sea The sustainability aspects of his buildings varies. Although modern materials such as cement and steel are used, their use is limited and it is mostly natural materials that are prominent in his buildings. The answers to what makes a sustainable building vary, depending on physical factors such as climate, land availability, local building materials and social and cultural factors. Courtyards, verandahs, and roofs are some of the elements Kuriakose uses in the design of buildings. Kerala, where he grew up, and Tamil Nadu where he has spent the last 25 years of his life have influenced him. According to Kuriakose, the biggest challenge in the building industry today is to ensure the quality of construction. Everybody is interested in quantity and if the quality of construction cannot be ensured, the buildings will not last for long.

Baker's sketches were translated into plans by him. In 1996, he moved to Chennai where he was commissioned to do the Kerala Section and the Public Buildings in DakshinaChitra. Tharangambadi and Chinnangudi tsunami rehabilitation project Kuriakose went on to design more than 1,000 individualized homes for fisherfolk in Tharangambadi and Chinnangudi villages in Nagapattinam, under the Tsunami Rehabilitation Project. The basic ideology of the project was to provide houses for the victims of the 2004 tsunami, which hit the east coast of India. Generally, in public housing programs in India and elsewhere, a single type design is used for the construction of all of the houses. In the case of the tsunami reconstruction project carried out by the NGO South Indian Federation of Fishermen Societies (SIFFS), a novel idea of involving the house owner in the design and construction of the house was tried out. Plots were allotted before the construction of the houses so that each house owner knew which house they would get. In the design of the houses and the settlement of Tharangambadi and Chinnankudi affected by the tsunami, it was decided to make sure that the community and home owners participated in the rebuilding. Different models were offered and model homes were built so that people could understand what they were actually going to get. The sites were allocated to individuals before starting the construction itself. The houses were highly customized and the home owners had control over the construction process. Muziris heritage project Paliam Palace Museum Kuriakose was selected as conservation consultant for the Muziris Heritage Project in 2007. Muziris is not just a place. It is a concept and the project was an attempt to educate future generations about heritage, and to throw light on Kerala‚Äôs pan-Indian and international trade links. The project's artifacts and monuments are spread out over an area of 150 km2, and Kuriakose's team has located clusters, including 400 buildings of historic importance and architectural interest. It is an alternate approach to heritage management, and the biggest challenge was to develop a concept which suits the local context. The Muziris Heritage Project has many dimensions. It is an educational project, a developmental project and a model for sustainable tourism. The project was the brainchild of Dr. Thomas Isaac, who had grown up in the area. An economics professor from the Centre for Development Studies, he became the finance minister of Kerala in 2006. He envisioned Muziris as a non-formal education project for future generations. The project involved the conservation of Paliam Palace, Paravur Synagogue, Kottappuram Fort, Kottappuram Market and many other historic structures in the Muziris area It has set a precedent in India for adopting an integrated approach to heritage conservation and regional development. The project also envisages features such as interactive museums, visitor centres, a virtual reconstruction centre, facilities to travel by boat on the River Periyar to various monuments, cycle tours of the area and circuit tours, to name a few. Floated in 2008, it is India's largest conservation project, spread over 25 sites, and links Kerala's histories of Dutch, Arabic, Chinese, Jewish, Greek, Portuguese and Roman roots in the forgotten port of Muziris from 1st Century BC onward. Anantya Resort The restoration of Cheraman Juma Mosque, the oldest mosque in India, removing all the modern appendages is an offshoot of the Muziris Heritage Project. The decision to replace the new chapel in the Kottappuram market with the old was taken by the congregation. The mosque and chapel are just two of the structures that are being transformed as a result of this initiative, coming up in a 150 square km area in central Kerala, in Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. When the project is completed, it will be a walk through 3,000 years of history of the southern Indian state of Kerala. The place is very special since this is where Jews, Arabs, Greeks, Portuguese, Dutch and the British etc. came together. Three religions came to India through this port namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Muziris Heritage Project set a precedent in India for adopting an integrated approach to heritage conservation and regional development.

He was descended from nobles and studied for almost two decades in Paris at the college there before returning to his homeland as a dean and canon prior to his episcopal nomination. He was diligent in his work in reforming the education of schools and the overall reorganization of his episcopal see. He was forced into a brief exile (with his father and some brothers imprisoned or killed in that time) but was able to continue his work upon his return. Upon his death he was known to be hailed as a saint with dozens of miracles reported both during and after his life with some reported at the site of his tomb in the diocesan cathedral. There were several processes and commissions set up to collect testimonies and documents to support his cause for canonization with an appeal made to the Council of Constance to declare him as such; canonization did not occur during the council, but Pope Martin V encouraged and endorsed the cause. Pope Innocent VIII approved for his relics to be translated which occurred during the pontificate of his successor Pope Alexander VI on 16 August 1492 which acted as a \\"de facto\\" canonization despite the fact no formal canonization was celebrated despite attempts to convince the pontiff to do so. Life Brinolfo AlgotssonHis first name is also known as \\"Brynolf\\" and his last name often referred to as \\"Brynolfsson\\" on the account of his paternal ancestors' names. was born in the 1240s or 1230s - but no later than 1248 - in V√§sterg√∂tland as the second of eight sons born to the nobleman Algot Brinolfsson (1220-1302) and Margareta Petersdotter (b. 1235). His siblings were: * Magnus (1259-1309) * Karl (d. 1289) * Folke ( 1263-1310) * Bengt (d. 1308) * R√∂rik * Peter * Nils He was educated in the cathedral school in Skara before being sent to pursue ecclesial studies in Paris at the college there for almost two decades where he heard the Dominican friar Thomas Aquinas give lectures.If born in 1248 then he had been in Paris from 1259 until his return to Sweden in 1277. He became noted for his extensive learning as well as his background in canon law and overall theological studies. He also underwent philosophical studies and science while at the college. Upon his return to his homeland he was ordained to the priesthood and appointed as the dean for the Link√∂ping chapter and the canon for Skara prior to being appointed as the Bishop of Skara in 1278 which Pope Nicholas III confirmed; he later received his episcopal consecration as a bishop around that time. He was enthroned in his episcopal see in the spring of 1279 and began his mission to renew his diocese. In 1281 he issued a charter which governed various tithes in addition to fining fellow prelates for various crimes committed should guilt be determined. The bishop became active in the nation's political life and worked hard to ensure that the needs and the teachings of the Church became an integral focus of all public policies put forth. He also supported the work of the missionaries who had come to his diocese and the nation in general. Algotsson wrote various and extensive theological works in addition to poems for particular liturgical feasts. He created a special house in Paris for students from Skara. But his work soon ran afoul of the absolutist King Magnus Ladulas in 1288 which prompted him to flee into a brief exile to escape the monarch's retribution. His exile saw his father imprisoned and some brothers of his either killed or imprisoned. But the persecution of his house came in 1289 when he and the king were reconciled which allowed for Algotsson to return to Skara to continue his work uninterrupted. In 1304 he oversaw a thorn from Jesus Christ's Crown of Thorns brought to the Skara diocese from L√∂d√∂se due to close ties he shared with Norwegian prelates. This had been cultivated since the 1280s after he helped in the financing of the reconstruction of the Stavanger Cathedral which had been devastated in a fire. On 2 September 1304 he greeted a Norwegian ship holding 2000 people and was presented with the thorn which was carried in solemn procession to the diocesan cathedral. This made his diocese a pilgrim destination that also generated revenue which Algotsson hoped to use to renovate the diocesan cathedral. He made 2 September the feast for the relic's reception and later wrote the \\"Historia de Spinea Corona\\" in order to describe how the thorn was gifted to his diocese. The bishop became noted in life for having performed several miracles such as that it was said he turned water into wine on several occasions, much like Jesus Christ had done at the wedding in Cana. He died in 1317 and his remains were interred in the Skara Cathedral. Bridget of Sweden visited his tomb on 2 February 1349 and there received a vision that revealed to her the holiness of the late bishop. In her vision she saw the Blessed Mother and Jesus Christ who also pointed out Algotsson's holiness to her, for she also saw bishop Brynolf in her vision. Sainthood King Erik of Pomerania appointed a commission in Skara in 1417 to collect documentation and testimonies (over 50 in total) needed for the late bishop with the cause being entrusted at some later point to Swedish monks who did additional research on the bishop's life and miracles; permission had been granted on 27 April 1416 for the process to be held which took place from 12 April 1417 until that 28 April. In 1414 the Archbishop of Uppsala Johannes Haquini and three other bishops (in addition to the Bishop of Lund Peder Kruse and the Bishop of Nidaros Eskil) wrote an application to the Council of Constance asking that he be canonized. Pope Martin V confirmed the cause would continue and provided his encouragement as to the cause's continuation. There were 34 miracles recorded between 1404 and 1417 either in Skara or L√∂d√∂se as the process determined. In 1492 additional documentation was collected for submission to Pope Innocent VIII with the intention of having Algotsson canonized in 1498. But Innocent VIII's death in 1492 hindered this to a significant degree. But Innocent VIII had given permission not long before his death for Algotsson's relics to be translated and a liturgical feast in his name affixed to that date. This took place during the pontificate of his successor Pope Alexander VI on 16 August 1492 (who had just been elected a week prior) which acted as a sort of \\"de facto\\" canonization even though no formal sanctification was celebrated and no official papal bull subscribed.Additional sources cite 1417 and 1498 as canonization dates. Hemming Gadd - on the behalf of Sten Sture the Elder - spoke to Pope Alexander VI on the subject of the canonization of the bishop and told the pontiff that it would be good for the Swedish church for four Swedish Blesseds such as Hemming of Turku to be canonized. This request was repeated in 1499 since no progress had been made and on 16 March 1499 the pope granted permission for a second translation of relics. This never occurred.

Biography Fritz Huber was born on 8 March 1881 in Wasserburg am Inn. He came from an old family of engineers. In Munich, he first attended the industrial school, then he began studying at the local technical college. He successfully completed his studies in 1903 and went on to work in France and Switzerland. After his return to Germany, he got a job at the Grade company in Magdeburg, where he devoted himself to the construction of high-quality two-stroke engines. He also built the first hot- bulb engines at the Climax plant in Vienna and improved their running characteristics with adjustable injectors and improved mass balance. On 20 September 1916, he obtained employment with Heinrich Lanz AG in Mannheim. He constructed gasoline-powered tractors for the German army in the First World War. Between 1918 and 1921 he developed a single-cylinder hot-bulb engine for stationary work. This engine was later used in the Lanz Bulldog, the first German heavy-oil tractor in mass production. Because of the First World War, the testing of the concept had to be postponed but, from 1920, the development and construction of the Bulldog got under way. The tractor got its name because of its external resemblance to a bulldog and Fritz Huber is considered the \\"Father of the Bulldogs\\". In 1942, Huber retired because of illness.

Career  Andreu was the first Hispanic woman to serve in the Coast Guard and the first to command a federal shore installation. She became keeper of the lighthouse on January 7, 1860, after her husband Joseph, who had been the lighthouse keeper since 1854, died. According to a report in the St. Augustine Examiner on December 10, 1859, he was whitewashing the tower when the scaffolding collapsed and he fell about 60 feet onto the roof of the building where oil for the light was stored.

He was a member and main songwriter of late 1980s glam punk band Soho Roses and produced for many bands including SMASH. He is the co-founder and owner of Damajive Studios, co-owner of Earthworks Studios, and the founder and owner of the current studio and production companies The Analogue Room and Damage Recordings. Early years Classically tutored from an early age, Davies formed his first band White Lie with school friends at age 12, and recorded for the first time at age 13 at The Crypt recording studio in Stevenage, UK. The band went on to enter and reach the regional finals of the TSB School Rock competition held at the Shaw Theatre Euston road in 1981. Later, the band morphed into The Gunrunners featuring guitarist (later of SMASH) Edward Borrie and Simon Coxhill, son of Jazz saxophonist Lol Coxhill. After the breakup of the band in 1986, Davies replied to an advertisement in Melody Maker and completed the lineup of London band The V2's which in 1987 became The Soho Roses. Damajive Studios After a short career with Soho Roses in the late 80s, Davies opened Damajive Studios in Hitchin, Hertfordshire in 1991. During this time, he recorded for numerous local bands, notably SMASH's Spring 1994 mini album, including the double A side \\"Lady, Love Your Cunt\\"/\\"Shame\\", King Rizla's seminal 1994 album Time For A New Day and the Guns n' Wankers LP For Dancing And Listening, released on Fat Wreck Chords. In 1995, due to SMASH's notoriety as an independent band, Shame appeared on the EMI compilation Unlaced. The studio remained open until 1996, when Davies semi-retired due to stress. While doing live sound at a local venue, he continued to record bands in his private analogue studio. Earthworks Studios In 2002, he was asked to become co-owner of the long- established London studio Earthworks. While there, Davies produced several notable and critically acclaimed records including The Freaks Union's 3rd Album Songs From Despair, Deadline's 4th album Take A Good Look (2006) and the studio tracks for their 5th album 'We're Taking Over', and The Mercury League's album La Libertad No Es Un Show. In 2006, Davies recorded UK black metal band Niroth's self titled album. Also in 2006, he recorded vocals for the Paul Di'Anno album The Beast Live. He also produced Gilla Bruja's first two albums Tooth and Nail (2002) and Six Fingered Jesus (2003). He played bass at a number of shows with the band when their bassist/singer The Wilda Beast (AKA Paul March) decided to sing vocals only following the release of 6 Finger Jesus. During this time, he also formed a post-punk hardcore band called Bad Head, singing and playing guitar. In 2007, Corpsing The Stench of Humanity was recorded, mixed and mastered in The Shed, which is where the analogue equipment was stored at Earthworks. In 2008, the same system was used to produce Polish death metal band Diachronia's Chaos Eternal LP, as well as work on CJ & The Satellites' album Thirteen, The Metatrons' Patterns of Chaos album, and James and Alex Bay's Roadrunner's independently released self titled album among others. In 2009, Davies produced Aghast!'s well-reviewed first EP Afterlife Crisis (which also appeared on a metal hammer CD). In 2009, Bad Head independently released a self-titled album. They subsequently played at the BBC Rhythms of The World festival in 2010. Davies parted company with Earthworks in 2011, due to personal problems after the death of his father in 2010. The Analogue Room In 2013, Davies restored his classic recording equipment and set up an entirely analogue studio. Over the next couple of years, the infrastructure and equipment in the studio were expanded and improved, including the acquisition of several vintage tape recorders. During this time, Andy produced several notable recordings, including The Zipheads Prehistoric Beat (2013) album, Nick And The Sun Machine's album Wide Lying Smiles (2014) and The Metatrons \\"Please Mister / Not Today\\" (2014) single. In 2013, Davies produced the new SMASH mini album Spring '13, a reworking of material from their earlier collaborations, including an updated version of their hit single \\"(I Want To) Kill Somebody 2014\\" at the same time as recording the Without Regret mini album which he also produced and engineered. Damage Recordings In 2016, Davies decided to expand from the analogue purist approach and return to a more modern recording ethos, while keeping the analogue facility intact and using hardware and software together in the form of Damage Recordings. The facility is complete and Davies is working on several projects. In this facility, he recently produced early demos for Dark Asphyxia's 2016 EP Executioner. In 2018, Davies produced BrainPain, an EP by punk metal band HeadAche. Controversies Davies' band Soho Roses was known as a rebellious glam punk act. After a gig supporting Teenage Idols at the Marquee Club in 1988, Steevi Jaimz of Tigertailz allegedly attempted to punch a member of the Soho Roses' entourage, triggering a notorious fight that resulted in Jaimz being ejected from the club. In a photograph taken by Ray Palmer used in an interview in \\"Metal Hammer\\" in November 1988, there is a copy of Guns N' Roses Appetite for Destruction LP featuring a prominent plastic dog turd, sparking a heated readers vs band debate in the next few issues of the magazine. Davies worked closely with the band Guns n' Wankers, featuring ex-members of Soho Roses. The band's name was a blatant reference to their dislike of the LA glam metal scene demonstrated in the classic \\"Metal Hammer\\" interview. Although correctly credited on the independent pressings, Davies' work on SMASH's Spring 1994 mini album and \\"Lady Love Your Cunt\\" /\\"Shame 7\\" single was misquoted on the UK pressing on Virgin's Hi-Rise Recordings label due to a clerical error. After a good deal of legal wrangling the issue was resolved, Davies being correctly credited on the U.S. Hut Recordings release and all subsequent reissues of the material.

The house is built in brick in 3 storeys plus basement and attic. It has a 5 bay front facade with a l9th-century central porch and a parapet. The high pitched hipped slated roof is surmounted by a row of linked tall brick chimneys. Extensions have been built to the side. Within the house is a chimneypiece by Sir John Soane, which was brought from the old Bank of England. History In the 13th century the property was known as Aldham and owned by a family of the same name, later passing to the St Clere family. Aldham became Aldham St Cleres and eventually St Cleres. The St Clere family died out in the 1400s and the estate was acquired by Henry Lovell, who built a new house there. In 1625 it passed to Sir John Sedley, 2nd Baronet (of Great Chart), who built the present house. By the death of the 4th baronet in 1702 the house was somewhat neglected and was sold to William Glanville, MP (formerly William Evelyn), High Sheriff of Kent for 1757. The house passed down in the Evelyn family via William Evelyn, MP and his son-in-law Alexander, who took the surname Evelyn and was High Sheriff of Kent for 1816. He left it to a cousin Lt-Col William John Evelyn, who rarely used the house and occasionally rented it out and in 1878 it was finally sold to Sir Mark Wilks Collet, Bt., a London merchant and later a Governor of the Bank of England. Collet carried out a series of renovations to the buildings and grounds, as did his son and successor Sir Mark Edlman Collet. When the latter moved abroad in 1935 the estate passed to Montagu Norman, 1st Baron Norman, in whose family it remains. The Mirror Crack'd, a 1980 British mystery film directed by Guy Hamilton based on Agatha Christie's thriller used the house as its main location. It stars Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, Kim Novak, Elizabeth Taylor, Geraldine Chaplin, Tony Curtis, Edward Fox, Rock Hudson.

Mary Thomas was from Antigua and arrived in St. Croix in the 1860s to take work on the plantations in the island. In 1878 she resided at the Sprat Hall plantation. She had three children but never married. Before the uprising, she had been sentenced for theft and for mistreating her children.Albert Scherfig & Nicklas Weis Damkj√¶r. 2016. \\"Kvinderne i Danmarks st√∏rste arbejderopstand\\" FRIKTION. Historians have suggested that such sentences were used by the authorities to discredit people who opposed the authorities. After the 1848 emancipation of enslaved Africans in the Danish West Indies, an 1849 labor law fixed salaries and labor conditions for all plantation workers and prohibited bargaining for better wages or work conditions. This made plantation work unattractive, and many workers opted to leave the plantations and the islands to seek better conditions elsewhere. The government reacted to the labor shortage by making it harder to for workers to leave the islands, demanding health certificates and charging fees for passports. When wages were to be negotiated in the fall of 1878, the workers' demands were denied, and new harsh conditions for traveling were imposed. This sparked the so-called Fireburn riots, which have been called the largest labor riot in Danish history, during which more than 50 plantations were burned. Because of her role as a leader during the uprising, Mary Thomas came to be known as \\"Queen Mary\\". The workers chose her and two other women, \\"Queen Agnes\\" and \\"Queen Matilda\\", as queens to perform ritual and celebratory functions during the uprising.Marsh, C. (1981).

During the trial of the labor leaders she gave witness testimony against another leader, Thomas Graydon, also known as \\"Colonel Peter\\", who was sentenced to death. Mary Thomas was also sentenced to death for arson and looting but had her sentence commuted to life imprisonment. She was transferred to Copenhagen and placed at Women's Prison, Christianshavn, in 1882, but in 1887 she was sent back to Christiansted, St. Croix, to serve the remainder of her sentence.https://www.virgin-islands-history.org/en/history/fates/the-three- rebel-queens/Philip Sampson. 2017. \\"Fireburn-dronningerne ‚Äì Danmarks glemte heltinder\\" http://pov.international/fireburn-dronningerne-danmarks-glemte- heltinder/  Legacy  Thomas obtained semi-mythical status in the Virgin Islands oral tradition, where a popular song commemorates her actions in the uprising: :\\"Queen Mary, ah where you gon' go burn? :Queen Mary, ah where you gon' go burn? :Don' ask me nothin' t'all :Just geh me de match an oil :Bassin Jailhouse, ah deh de money dey\\"Jeannette Allis Bastian. 2003.

Biography McInerney was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, the only child of grazier Leslie McInerney and his wife, Florence (nee Smith). Forebears had farmed in the Southern Tablelands for more than 150 years, and Peter grew up on the family property, Moonyah, near Collector. His initial education was by correspondence, then at the tiny Breadalbane Primary School. He completed his Leaving Certificate in 1945 at St. Joseph's College in Hunters Hill, where he led the senior debating team.

Haight Jr. was an American G.I. who had served as a U.S. Army Air Force sergeant during World War II. After the war, he became \\"famous\\" by serving as a mercenary commander of the rebel forces of Azad Kashmir for a few months in 1947. His testimony about Pakistan's involvement in the hostilities was cited in the United Nations debates on the Kashmir dispute. Army career By his own account, Haight served in three armies during the World War II. He first served with the Canadians, then switched to the British and participated in the commando raid on Dieppe. Finally, he joined the American Army after the US joined the war. After the war, Haight went to Afghanistan and worked as a surveyor for the American construction company Morrison‚ÄìKnudsen, which was engaged in building roads there. After having a fall from a cliff, he left the job, and was intending to head back to the US with various stops in Pakistan and India along the way.  Kashmir War  Towards the end of 1947, the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces garrisoned in Poonch were besieged from all sides, and the Indian Army forces based in Naushera were also under severe attack. In Rawalpindi, then the hotbed of the First Kashmir War raging in 1947, Haight ran into the British correspondent Bill Sydney Smith of the Daily Express, who suggested to him that he could utilise his expertise in commanding the Pakistani tribal raiders engaged in the Kashmir War. Haight was sold on the idea.: \\"The correspondent suggested that the raiders could use such an experienced soldier, and why didn't Haight apply to the Pakistanis for a commission? Haight thought it over and decided it was a good idea.\\" He signed up with the Azad Kashmir provisional government, then based in Rawalpindi. He was given a commission as a Captain and sent to the Poonch front. After he criticised the Azad Kashmir commanders there for their \\"boy scout tactics\\", the government apparently promoted him to the rank of a \\"brigadier general\\". He later claimed to have commanded 8,000 troops. LIFE, 16 February 1948, p.42. According a New York Times report, Haight was able to successfully discharge his command by playing on the vanity of the tribesmen and exploiting their tribal rivalries. By the end of 1947, Haight's engagement with the Kashmir War was over. While he claimed to have quit because of inadequate resources, scuffles with some of the fighters from Dir had played a role. The fighters are said to have attempted to steal Haight's truck and some captured guns, and he ended up killing a couple of them in the ensuing firefight. According to the New York Times, he was effectively a fugitive by the time he left Pakistan. He took a flight to the US with only $2.00 in his pocket. \\"Russel K.

He was born in St. Louis to John and Mary Bentley Ellis. He began working in the newspaper industry in his teens as a press room apprentice, becoming a pressman in 1886. The next year he enlisted in the Navy, where he stayed for three years, spending most of that time in the Far East. When he returned to the US he worked for the Brockton Enterprise in Massachusetts and the Boston Herald, and in 1900 became press room foreman for The Worcester Telegram. In 1905 he began working on inventions to improve printing press operations. The publisher of the Telegram, Austin P. Cristy, insisted that he either resign or stop dividing his time between his work and his inventing. Ellis resigned, and made enough money from his inventions to purchase the Worcester Telegram from Cristy in 1919 for $1,000,000. His inventions included several press blankets, which he founded the New England Fibre Blanket Company to manufacture; they were distributed through the New England Newspaper Supply Company, which he ran. He also became a textile manufacturer, and founded the New England Woolen Fabric Company. He was chairman of the Royal Worcester Corset Company. At one time he served as the president of the New England Daily Newspaper Association. In about 1912 he married Mary Griffin in Spencer, Massachusetts; they had no children. In 1920 he acquired The Worcester Evening Gazette from George F. Booth, and combined the two papers into Worcester Telegram-Gazette, selling the combined paper, along with The Sunday Telegram, in 1925 to a group including Booth, for about $2,000,000. He remained an honorary member of the International Printing Pressmen's Union, despite becoming a publisher, and gave $100,000 in 1928 to the union's widows and orphans fund. In August 1931, Ellis and Frank Knox jointly bought control of the Chicago Daily News. Knox became the publisher, and Ellis was Vice President. Ellis was an art collector; his collection included the Northbrook Madonna, at that time thought to be by Raphael, painted in about 1505. He bought it from the Earl of Northbrook in 1928. He was a director of the Worcester Art Museum. In 1928 he bought Knollwood, a large estate near Worcester, now in the National Register of Historic Places. Ellis kept a herd of prize cattle, and in 1931 one of his Guernsey cows, \\"Green Meadow Lustre\\", broke the record for the most milk and butterfat produced in a single year by a cow between three-and-a-half and four years of age.

The fire, understood to have been caused by a failure in electrical infrastructure, began in the locality of Reedy Swamp, near Tarraganda, which spread east towards in the municipality of the Bega Valley Shire. The fire burned through over 1,250 hectares (3,100 acres) of farmland and forest reserves, before impacting the village of Tathra. The fire burned into the town and resulted in an urban conflagration that destroyed over 100 structures. Background Between July 2017 and February 2018 over 11,000 uncontrolled bushfires burnt across New South Wales; with major fires in the Sydney, Shoalhaven/Jervis Bay, Hunter, Mid Coast, Port Stephens, the Pilliga, Southern Tablelands, Mid Western and Tamworth/New England areas. December 2017 was the fifth-warmest December on record. In February 2018 the Minister for Emergency Services, Troy Grant, urged the public to help fire agencies by ensuring they remain prepared for fires. The day of the fire, 18 March 2018, was an extremely hot and windy day, with conditions reaching over and winds gusting to over at the time the fire started. Timeline March 18, 2018 * 11:15 - Fire near Tarraganda reported to local NSW Rural Fire Service by Tathra resident. * 12:28 - First 000 call received, reporting bush fire in the Reedy Swamp area, near Tarraganda. * 12:33 - Firefighting units are dispatched from the NSW Rural Fire Service, with offers of assistance from Fire and Rescue NSW declined. * 12:38 - A large smoke column from the fire is highly visible throughout the Bega Valley area. * 12:44 - The first Rural Fire Service unit arrives at the scene of the fire. * 12:54 - Firefighters on scene report the fire is burning intensely and report Tathra as a possible future threat. * 12:58 - The NSW Rural Fire Service decline a second offer of assistance from Fire and Rescue NSW with the fire rapidly escalating. * 13:22 - The fire jumps Reedy Swamp Road and overruns firefighting units attempting to cut it off. * 13:30 - At least 12 separate fires have started in the Bega Valley area. * 14:56 - The fire jumps the Bega River and begins its run towards Tathra. * 15:00 - At least 20 separate fires are burning in the Bega Valley area. * 15:22 - Houses along Thompsons Drive, west of Tathra, begin to be impacted by fire. * 15:34 - The fire begins impacting the main Tathra township. * 15:56 - An urgent request is made by firefighters on the ground for any available unit to respond to Tathra. * 16:16 - Crews on the ground report at least 35 houses are alight. * 16:27 - The fire reaches the beach after burning through the township and stops at the ocean. * 17:29 - At least 50 houses are reported to be alight. * 22:40 - At least 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) are believed to have been burnt, with the fire yet to be brought totally under control. March 19, 2018 * Morning - Firefighters confirm the fire is under control, with at least 70 buildings destroyed and with more than 200 people seeking shelter in the Bega evacuation centre. * Afternoon - Firefighters confirm 69 houses, 30 cabins/caravans as well as numerous other buildings have been destroyed, with a further 39 damaged and numerous people injured. Response The NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, Member for Bega, Andrew Constance, Member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly and Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visited Tathra soon after the fire and met with evacuated people at the Bega Showgrounds. On 26 March 2018 Berejiklian and Constance announced that up to $10 million was available to remove asbestos-contaminated material and to help residents to clean up their properties; with the clean-up operation coordinated by NSW Public Works in conjunction with insurers and the Bega Valley Shire Council. On 29 March Prime Minister Turnbull officially declared the Tathra and Reedy Swamp areas a disaster zone for the purposes of affected residents accessing Australian disaster relief funds. The NSW Government appointed Euan Ferguson as the official Recovery Coordinator and announced that impacted residents could access disaster relief grants to eligible individuals and families whose homes and essential household contents have been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster; small business were provided access to free independent and confidential business advice; NSW Family and Community Services provided a range of temporary housing support options; and a range of other support services were provided. The Bega Valley Shire Council established a Mayoral Appeal Fund, under the chairmanship of Councillor Kristy McBain, the Mayor; over $1,500,000 has been raised to date. Investigations Immediately following the fire, numerous criticisms were raised by Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters through the Fire Brigade Employees Union in relation to the handling of the fire. Of immediate concern was the fact that their assistance had been declined in the early stages of the fire, which they believe cost more houses which could have been saved. Further culminating the issue were claims by RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers that it would have been \\"dangerous\\" for Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters to attend the fire, a claim which was later refuted. Following the allegations, further information was released detailing numerous incidents across the entire state where the Rural Fire Service had denied help from Fire and Rescue NSW at fires and other emergencies. As a result of this, the NSW Government instituted a commission of inquiry, headed by Mick Keelty , a former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The focus of the inquiry was on the call taking and dispatch arrangements of both Fire and Rescue NSW and the NSW Rural Fire Service. Both the Fire Brigade Employees Union and former Commissioner Keelty emphasised prior to and following the report, that it would not be a criticism of the action of volunteers, but rather an investigation into the overall co- ordination of emergency incidents in NSW. The inquiry identified numerous issues with the response to, and management of the fire. These included: the fact \\"some policies were not followed on the day\\"; a deputy incident controller was not appointed; there were delays in feeding information back to the FRNSW ComCen who were on the line to numerous 000 callers seeking assistance; the 'Fires Near Me' app was not regularly updated; an emergency alert was issued too late; ABC radio continued normal broadcasts on the day of the fires rather than broadcasting emergency updates; there were discrepancies in the number of resources attached to the fire between agencies; the RFS were limited to communications by radio with no real time vehicle locators; and that the 000 call taking system was \\"cumbersome\\" among other issues. The key issue of the declined FRNSW assistance was addressed by Keelty in the report. Keelty stated that \\"It is likely that assistance from FRNSW was initially declined without full situational awareness of the intensity and speed of the fire\\" and that \\"FRNSW ComCen overruled the decision of the RFS District Duty Officer and deployed to the Bega Valley fires without being called out, but as it happened this was very useful for the overall protection of homes\\".

It gave its name to the county of Wolfstein which was dissolved in 1972.  Location  The schloss lies northwest of the town centre of Freyung on a rocky crag surrounded on three sides by the Sau√übach river.  History  Wolfstein Castle was built as a fortification by the Bishop of Passau, Wolfger von Erla, around 1200. Before that, the surrounding land had been ceded to the bishops of Passau by Emperor Henry VI in 1193. In 1301, a place is first mentioned in a document as Purchstol zu Wolferstein und ein Wald dazu, later Freyung. The castle itself served as a fortification, administrative base and episcopal hunting lodge. When the Prince-Bishopric of Passau was dissolved in 1803, Wolfstein was initially annexed by Austria. Three years later, the area went to the Kingdom of Bavaria after the Treaty of Pressburg. In 1806, the Bavarian Landgerichtsbezirk of Wolfstein was established with its headquarters at Schloss Wolfstein in the municipality (Landgemeinde) of Ort. It belonged to the Lower Danube Circle (which became Lower Bavaria in 1838). In 1862, the new Landgerichtsbezirk of Waldkirchen was established from municipalities of the Landgerichtsbezirke of Wolfstein and Wegscheid and the former Landgericht of Wolfstein was renamed to the Landgericht of Freyung. Both Landgerichtsbezirke belonged to the Bezirksamt of Wolfstein. In 1938, the Bezirke were renamed Landkreise. Since the incorporation of the municipality of Ort on 1 April 1954, Wolfstein Castle has stood on the territory of the town of Freyung. In 1972 the county of Wolfstein was dissolved.  Present day  Prince's Room The schloss ensemble includes a mighty tower house, built between 1199 and 1204 and 1590, two low wings with arcades, dating to the late 16th and early 17th century, and the castle wall with closed quadrangular courtyard. Since 1982 it has housed the county art collection, Galerie Wolfstein, with its collection of contemporary art from Eastern Bavaria; since 1989 it has also been home to the Hunting and Fishing Museum (Jagd- und Fischereimuseum)JAGD LAND FLUSS Museum in Schloss Wolfstein; 741 kB of the county. This was redesigned and reopened in 2014 under the name Jagd Land Fluss (\\"Hunt Country River\\"). Directly in front of the castle is are the council offices for Freyung-Grafenau.

Both submarines and surface units of the Soviet Navy were employed. The campaign scored successes during Operation Hannibal.  Background  When Finland joined sides with the Allies in September 1944, the Soviet Navy could successfully avoid the German mine barrages at the entry of Gulf of Finland and quickly resumed submarine operations during the second part of the year. At the beginning of 1945 the Soviet Navy dispatched once again submarines alongside motor torpedo boats for coastal attacks but avoided the use destroyers and major warship. Twenty Soviet submarines were engaged into the offensive, performing more patrols compared to 1944 and displaying an increased aggressive behavior: cooperations with reconnaissance aircraft was sometimes performed.  Submarine Engagements  On the night between 6 and 7 January, Soviet submarine S-4 was lost, likely rammed and sunk by German torpedo boat T-3 in Danzig Bay.
