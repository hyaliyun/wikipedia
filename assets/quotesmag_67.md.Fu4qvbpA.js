It stars Carly Schroeder as Gracie Bowen, Dermot Mulroney as Bryan Bowen, Elisabeth Shue as Lindsay Bowen, Jesse Lee Soffer as Johnny Bowen, and Andrew Shue as Coach Owen Clark. Gracie takes place in New Jersey, United States in 1978, before 1972's Title IX had taken much effect in women's college sports and when organized women's soccer was still very rare in the United States. Gracie, the film's central protagonist, overcomes the loss of her brother by convincing her family and school to allow her to play varsity soccer on an all-boys team. The story is partially based on the childhood experiences of Elisabeth Shue, who was one of the producers in addition to being the wife of Davis Guggenheim, the director, as well as a cast member. The novelization of Gracie, written by Suzanne Weyn, was released in June 2007. Plot In the year 1978, Gracie Bowen, a 15-year-old tomboy who lives in South Orange, New Jersey, is crazy about soccer, as are her three brothers and their former soccer star father. Although Gracie wants to join her brothers and neighbor Kyle in the nightly practices her father runs, she is discouraged by everyone except her older brother, Johnny. Johnny, Gracie and Kyle attend Columbia High School, where Johnny is the captain and star player for the varsity soccer team. After missing a shot at the end of a game, the despondent Johnny drives off with a friend's car and dies in a traffic accident. Struggling with grief, Gracie decides that she wants to replace her brother on the team. Her father does not believe that girls should play soccer, telling her she is neither tough nor talented enough. Her mother is a nurse who lacks the competitive drive of the rest of her family and fears for Gracie's safety. Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman. Rejected and depressed, Gracie begins to rebel; she stops doing her schoolwork, is caught cheating on an exam, and experiments with wild and self-destructive behavior. She is finally caught by her father almost having sex with a guy she met near the docks after telling her friend, \\"I want to do something that I've never done before.\\" This serves as a wake-up call for her parents, particularly her father. He quits his job to work with her on her soccer training. When the school board rejects her request to play boys' soccer, Gracie files an appeal. Citing the newly passed Title IX, Gracie argues that since a girls' soccer team does not exist, she should be allowed to play on the boys' varsity soccer team. The school board allows her to try out for the team. After a very rough tryout, she makes the junior varsity team and has to decide if she is willing to settle for playing at that level. She decides to make the most of playing on junior varsity. One of the coaches asks her to come up to the main team for their championship game. After saying no at first she finally goes. Gracie watches from the bench as the game goes to sudden death overtime. New captain Kyle gets hurt and Gracie goes in for him, scoring the winning goal with a move that her dad taught her.  Cast Historical background The premise of the film rests upon the conflicting expectations of two different American generations. As Gracie's parents were most likely both products of what is now referred to as the \\"Silent Generation\\" of children born during the Great Depression and World War II, they would have been raised to adhere to traditional gender roles.'Trying to Live a Passionate Life': Interview with Andrew Shue This would have included discouraging a girl from participating in \\"boys' sports\\" such as soccer, as opposed to \\"girls' sports\\" such as cheerleading or gymnastics.Girlie Girls and Manly Men: Children's Stigma Consciousness of Gender in Sports and Physical Activities Gracie, on the other hand, came of age during the 1970s, when new and controversial ideas about gender were being introduced.The Future of Women's Sport and Fitness Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, critic for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, noted an additional generation gap between those in the film and those in the audience, many of whom grew up with the United States women's national soccer team (which played its first game in 1985) as a reality: 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup Other critics have also noted the multiple generation gaps. Kevin Cahillane observes in the New York Times that, \\"this being 1978 (before Title IX turned a generation of girls from onlookers into athletes), her desire goes against the wishes of the coach, the principal, the other players and her heartbroken parents.\\" In another article for the New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis further argues that, \\"[Gracie] is accustomed to having her abilities overlooked ... When tragedy strikes, and Grace channels her grief into a resolution to play on the all-male varsity team, even her best friend is horrified. As everyone knows, only lesbians play soccer.\\"Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions The film closes with the following remarks: \\"Thanks to Title IX and brave girls like Gracie, there are over 5 million girls who play soccer in America. Since 1991 the U.S. Women's National team has won Soccer's World Championships four times.\\" (FIFA Women's World Cup Champions 1991, 1999, 2015, and 2019) Production=Development and casting Elisabeth Shue in August 2007. The film is loosely based on life events concerning the Shue family. Former Melrose Place star Andrew Shue, who developed the film, was one of its producers, and acted a supporting role in the film, initially conceived of it as a story about his late brother William, the oldest Shue sibling, who was the captain of the Columbia High School soccer team that won the New Jersey state championship in 1978; he had died in an accident in 1988. As Andrew developed the idea with his brother-in-law Davis Guggenheim, the director of An Inconvenient Truth, the storyline began to shift towards Guggenheim's wife, Elisabeth Shue, Andrew's older sister. She became the model for Gracie, and William became the model for Johnny. As Andrew Shue noted in an interview: This refers to Elisabeth Shue's own decision in 1972, at the age of nine, to play soccer on an all-boys team, making her the first girl in the South Orange and Maplewood areas of New Jersey to do so.Based on a real story, 'Gracie' is a Shue thing Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. \\"There was no other choice back then,\\" she pointed out to the interviewer. \\"There was no girls team to play on.\\" Shue continued to play on the team until 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, \\"the movie is really what would have happened if I hadn't quit [playing soccer]. I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I'd been brave enough.\\" Andrew, Elizabeth, their brother John (who was also a producer on the film), and Guggenheim then engaged in an extensive search to find the right actress for the role of fifteen-year-old Gracie; they promoted the search on the website findinggracie.com.Shue Business, an April 2005 article from the Entertainment Weekly website The role eventually went to athlete-actress Carly Schroeder. Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat argue that Schroeder \\"puts in a stellar performance as the teenager who becomes a warrior when most of her peers are cheering from the sidelines.\\"Gracie: A film review Andrew Shue in February 2006 Filming took partial place at Columbia High School, both the setting of the events of the film and the actual high school the Shue family members had attended.Columbia High Soccer Filming also took place in various locations in South Plainfield, New Jersey. Andrew Shue chose to honor his former Dartmouth and Columbia High School teammate Chris Colasanti by naming the story's coach after him. Colasanti, who had been the captain of Columbia's 1985 state championship team, was killed in the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center. Reception=Reviews At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper gave Gracie \\"Two Thumbs up\\", stating, \\"You've seen it before, but you'll rarely see it better.\\"Ebert and Roeper review Gracie is a New York Times Critics' Pick. Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis described Gracie as \\"a familiar underdog story told with unusual sensitivity ... Gracie connects the adversity-drama dots – the beat-down, the bounce-back, the last-minute support from an unexpected quarter – with a subtle awareness of the shock waves of bereavement. Balancing the emotional complexity is Chris Manley's refreshingly unaffected cinematography; the drama of a free kick, like that of a good movie, is best viewed through a steady lens.\\"Soccer Dreams and Family Tensions Bill Zwecker, of the Chicago Sun-Times, stated, \\"It's a sweet and uplifting film, and though quite predictable, gives us a family drama that showcases simple truths about overcoming seemingly impossible odds and leaves you with a warm and very satisfying feeling deep down. It's a solid, hopeful and inspiring story that reminds us of what we might call 'old-fashioned' values about perseverance and making your dreams come true. Old-fashioned? Not at all.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly argued that \\"in 1978, a high school girl playing competitive soccer wasn't just novel – it was barely heard of. This amiable rouser, based on the experiences of Elisabeth Shue and her family, tries to convey how gutsy and role-smashing it is for ... Gracie to cleat her way onto an all-boys soccer team. So why is Gracie as processed as an after-school special? You miss the knockabout edge of Bend It Like Beckham – though the ending, in its Pavlovian sports-flick way, pumps you up.\\"Review of Gracie Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club suggested that \\"though Gracie fashions Shue's story into ready-made inspirational formula, it's nonetheless vivid in its particulars, from the looks and sounds of late-'70s New Jersey to the portrait of a soccer-driven family reformed by loss.\\"Review of Gracie from The A.V. Club Lael Loewenstein of the Los Angeles Times stated that Gracie is \\"an earnest, well-acted, poignant drama that nevertheless runs afoul of sports movie clichés.\\"Review of Gracie from the Los Angeles Times The film received a 61% rating from Rotten Tomatoes from 93 reviews (57 fresh and 36 rotten reviews).Gracie at Rotten Tomatoes  Box office  On a budget of $9 million, the limited release film made about $4 million at the box office and over $3 million in rentals.

The use of HES on critically ill patients is associated with an increased risk of death and kidney problems. HES is a general term and can be sub-classified according to average molecular weight, molar substitution, concentration, C2/C6 ratio and Maximum Daily Dose. The European Medicines Agency commenced in June 2013 the process of agreeing to reduced indications which was completed in October 2013. The process of full withdrawal in the EU was expected to complete in 2018.  Medical uses  A hydroxyethyl starch solution ready for intravenous infusion. An intravenous solution of hydroxyethyl starch is used to prevent shock following severe blood loss caused by trauma, surgery, or other problem. It however appears to have greater risk of a poor outcome compared to other intravenous solutions and may increase the risk of death.  Adverse effects  HES can cause anaphylactoid reactions: hypersensitivity, mild influenza-like symptoms, slow heart rate, fast heart rate, spasms of the airways, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. It is also linked to a decrease in hematocrit and disturbances in blood clotting. One liter of 6% solution (Hespan) reduces factor VIII level by 50% and will prolong the aPTT and will also decrease vWF.Miller: Anesthesia, 6th ed, p 1787 A coagulation effect of hetastarch administration is direct movement into fibrin clots and a dilutional effect on serum. Hetastarch may lead to platelet dysfunction by causing a reduction in the availability of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa on platelets. HES derivatives have been demonstrated to have increased rates of acute kidney failure and need for renal replacement therapy and to decrease long-term survival when used alone in cases of severe sepsis compared with Ringer lactate solution. The effects were tested on HES 130kDa/0.42 in people with severe sepsis; analysis showed increased rates of kidney failure and increased mortality when compared to LR. It has been recommended that, since medium-MW HES solutions may be associated with harm, these solutions should not be used routinely for patients with septic shock. During 2010/11 a large number of research papers associated with a single author were retracted for ethical reasons, and this may affect clinical guidelines referring to HES preparations prepared before this date. Contraindications Prescribing information contains the following contraindications: * This product should not be used in people who are hypersensitive or allergic to hydroxyethyl starch. * Patients with kidney failure not related to low blood volume and patients on dialysis should avoid this product in high doses which are used for volume expansion. * Use of hydroxyethyl starch with normal saline in its preparation is contraindicated in people with severe increases in blood levels of sodium or chloride. * Patients with intracranial bleeds should not use this product. On November 25, 2013, following a public workshop to discuss new information on the risks and benefits of HES solution, the USFDA announced the addition of a black box warning to the prescribing information which includes the following recommendations to health professionals: * Do not use HES solutions in critically ill adult patients, including those with sepsis. * Avoid use in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction. * Discontinue use of HES at the first sign of renal injury. * Need for renal replacement therapy has been reported up to 90 days after HES administration. Continue to monitor renal function for at least 90 days in all patients. * Avoid use in patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass due to excess bleeding. * Discontinue use of HES at the first sign of coagulopathy. * Do not use HES products in patients with severe liver disease * Monitor liver function in patients receiving HES products. Safety concerns High molecular weight HES has been linked to coagulopathy, pruritus, as well as nephrotoxicity, acute renal failure and mortality. On the other hand, low molecular weight HES seems not to demonstrate such adverse effects. However, some suggest that low molecular weight HES poses significant safety concerns. They posit that studies concluding otherwise are not reliable for a number of reasons including “unsuitable comparators, too short observation periods, low cumulative dose and low-risk patients.” (Hartog & Reinhart, 2009, p 1340). Recent results of 6S trial seem to confirm these concerns (see below). In June 2012 a 6S paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine raising concerns regarding the use of hydroxyethyl starch in sepsis. Specifically, the authors showed that resuscitation with hydroxyethyl starch (as opposed to Ringer's acetate) resulted in an increased risk of death or end stage renal failure. This study used Tetraspan (HES 130/0.42) of the pharmaceutical company B.Braun but the original version of the publication contained the product specification HES 130/0.4. The pharmaceutical company, Fresenius Kabi, that makes a similar product but with the specification HES 130/0.4 is threatening to bring legal action against the author, Anders Perner, as they wanted the misleading use of their product specification to be corrected. The academic community has raised concerns regarding this sort of behavior by a corporation although Fresenius Kabi did not doubt the results of the study. The CHEST study compared Hes130/0.40 with Saline in 7000 patients. The study was performed in patients that were less sick than in 6s; however, the increase in mortality was similar to 6s. There has also been a significant increase in dialysis rate overall. The increase in creatinine confirmed the pathophysiological rationale. Furthermore, the patients needed more blood products, had significant more liver failure and itching. The study was published in the NEJM in October 2012. As a consequence, in November 2012 the European Regulatory Agency (EMA) started an Official Procedure to Assess the Safety of all HES Products. The FDA in September 2012 conducted a Public Workshop addressing Safety concerns of HES, which according to the majority of participants should be addressed by regulators. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign decided to ban HES from treatment in sepsis patients. On June 14, 2013, PRAC, which is the safety committee of EMA, the European regulatory agency, published on their official website the recommendation to suspend the marketing authorisation of all HES products in Europe. The risk benefit ratio is negative based on results of 3 megatrials (VISEP, 6S, CHEST). A clinical benefit could not be demonstrated in any patient population, and there was ample evidence of harm, especially kidney failure due to long-term storage of the product in vital organs severely restricting its potential indications. The FDA followed on June 24. MHRA recalled the HES products on June 27 as the risks outweigh potential benefits and safer and cheaper alternatives are available. The EMA held an ad hoc expert meeting on December 18, 2017 to help inform its further consideration of the issue. Some further longer term data had been published although some trials had yet to complete. On January 12, 2018, PRAC [Pharamocovigilance Risk Assessment Committee] recommended the European Medicine Agency to withdraw the marketing authorization of hydroxyethyl starch containing medicinal products. An issue was that some use appeared to be outside the restricted license, potentially in areas of practice where there was evidence of harm. This may be a global issue as there is evidence that in areas of practice such as post- partum hemorrhage use has continued outside WHO guidelines. The recommendation was adopted by the Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedure Co- ordination Group (CMDh) on January 26, 2018. In April 2018, the European Commission requested that the PRAC and the CMDh further consider any possible unmet medical need that could result from a suspension, as well as the feasibility and likely effectiveness of additional risk minimisation measures. After looking at these specific aspects, in May 2018 the PRAC confirmed its previous recommendation for suspension and sent a revised recommendation to the CMDh. The CMDh concluded that HES solutions for infusion should remain on the market provided that a combination of additional measures to protect patients is implemented. The European Commission took an EU-wide legally binding decision on 17 July 2018.  Pharmacokinetics  Different types of hydroxyethyl starches are typically described by their average molecular weight, typically around 130 to 200 kDa (bearing in mind that there will be a range of different-sized molecules in any given solution); and their degree of molar substitution (what proportion of the glucose units on the starch molecule have been modified with hydroxyethyl units), typically around 0.35 to 0.5. A solution of hydroxyethyl starch may further be described by its concentration in % (i.e. grams per 100ml). So for example, one commercially available hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven) is described as 6% HES 130 / 0.4. The elimination depends on molar substitution degree. Molecules smaller than the renal threshold (60–70 kDa) are readily excreted in the urine while a small part of the larger ones are metabolized by plasma α–amylase before those degradation products are renally excreted. However HES is only partly degraded and excreted, while for a large amount the metabolism remains unclear. Approximately one-third to two-thirds of administered HES cannot be accounted for by 24-h urinary excretion. In one study the cumulative excretion over 72 h was 50% of the administered dose. HES has remained detectable in plasma 4 months after infusion, and in skin tissue up to 54 months after HES infusion. Administered HES accumulates in large quantities within diverse tissues where it can persist for periods of several years. Therefore, HES should not be administered for longer than 24 hours.

It is held on the Poznań fairground in Poland. Poznań International Fair is located in the centre of the city opposite the main railway station - Poznań Główny, in the centre of Poland and in the centre of Europe. Typically, there are about 13,200 exhibitors including about 3,000 foreign companies from 70 countries of the world participate in 80 trade fair events organized on the grounds of the Poznań fair. The Poznań-based fair owns the largest exhibition and conference infrastructure in Poland, including 16 high standard air- conditioned halls with a large exhibition area (over in exhibition halls and almost on open grounds) and 81 modern conference rooms. History The 2012 Poznań International Fair The idea of organising a modern fair by Polish manufacturers and merchants had its origins during the congress of the Union of Merchant Associations held in Poznań in 1917. The Union was an organisation of Polish merchants from Greater Poland and Eastern Pomerania. The fair was required to be of an international character and organised like the Leipzig Trade Fair. The first Poznań Trade Fair (I Targ Poznański), as it was called, took place in 1921 (from 28 May till 5 June), and the first chairman was Mieczysław Krzyżankiewicz. Before 1924, only Polish companies, companies from Free City of Gdańsk and foreign companies with branches in Poland which were represented by Polish citizens could participate. During 1924, agreements were signed with companies from Czechoslovakia, France, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Germany, Romania, Switzerland, and Sweden, so that the first really international fair took place in 1925. In 1927 the PIF was accepted as a member of the UFI. View at the Iglica (Hall 11) The intensive developments of the 1920s were crowned by the huge General National Exhibition () of 1929 that was visited by 4,5 mln people. This was the year that the Great Depression began. Despite the difficult economic situation, the PIF survived and at the end of the interbellum it was one of largest companies of its kind in Europe. During World War II, the company ceased to exist, its infrastructure was confiscated, and turned into a factory of Focke-Wulf, which made the PIF a military target for the Allied air forces. This led to great destruction of its infrastructure in 1945. During the war 85% of the PIF was destroyed, but despite this damage, the first postwar exhibition took place in 1946 and one year later, in 1947, the PIF had already regained its international character. In 1990 the Poznań International Fair transformed into a limited liability company with the State Treasure as one of its shareholders Since then the PIF is continuing to expand and enlarge its exhibition space. Poznań International Fair today Today the PIF is the largest trade fair organizer in Poland (by over 50% of total exhibition area and over 60% of exhibitors). It is the 21st largest fair in the world, with about 50 trade events taking place on its area every year. Area of PIF is over indoor and outdoor exhibition space. PIF a is state-owned company - 60% of shares belong to Polish State Treasury, and 40% to the City of Poznań. MTP organises expositions of Polish leaders at over 50 renowned trade shows and exhibitions abroad in such countries as: Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Czech Republic, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. MTP has foreign representative offices all over the world.The World Expo Company is an official representative office of MTP Group in Ukraine and works on such exhibitions as Budma and other. Every year, MTP organises over 1,600 congresses, conferences and workshops and hosts about 100,000 participants at these events.

The packed cells are typically used in anemia that is either causing symptoms or when the hemoglobin is less than usually 70–80 g/L (7–8 g/dL). In adults, one unit brings up hemoglobin levels by about 10 g/L (1 g/dL). Repeated transfusions may be required in people receiving cancer chemotherapy or who have hemoglobin disorders. Cross matching is typically required before the blood is given. It is given by injection into a vein. Side effects include allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis, red blood cell breakdown, infection, volume overload, and lung injury. With current preparation methods in the developed world the risk of viral infections such as hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS are less than one in a million. However, the risks of infection are higher in low income countries. Packed red blood cells are produced from whole blood or by apheresis. They typically last for three to six weeks. The widespread use of packed red blood cells began in the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom they cost about £120 per unit. A number of other versions also exist including whole blood, leukocyte reduced red blood cells, and washed red blood cells. Medical uses RBCs are used to restore oxygen-carrying capacity in people with anemia due to trauma or other medical problems, and are by far the most common blood component used in transfusion medicine. Historically they were transfused as part of whole blood, but are now typically used separately as RBCs and plasma components. More than 100 million units of blood are collected each year around the world, and about 50% of these are given to people in high income countries. In low-income countries, the majority of blood transfusions (up to 65%) are given to children under 5 years of age to treat severe childhood anemia. Another major use of blood in low income countries is to treat pregnancy-related complications. Whereas in high-income countries, most blood transfusions are given to people over 65 years of age (up to 76%). In these countries transfusion are most commonly used for supportive care in heart surgery, transplant surgery, massive trauma, and therapy for solid and blood cancers. Due to changes in surgical practices, medical use of blood is now the major use of red blood cells in high-income countries. Whenever a red cell transfusion is being considered for an individual patient it is good practice to consider not only the hemoglobin level, but also the overall clinical context, patient preferences, and whether there are alternative treatments. If a person is stable and has a hematinic deficiency they should be treated for the deficiency (iron deficiency, B12 deficiency, or folate deficiency) rather than being given a red cell transfusion. In adults blood transfusion is typically recommended when hemoglobin levels reach 70 g/L (7 g/dL) in those who have stable vital signs, unless they have anemia due to a hematinic deficiency. Transfusing at a restrictive hemoglobin threshold of between 70 g/L to 80 g/L (7 to 8g/dL) decreased the proportion of people given a red blood cell transfusion by 43% across a broad range of clinical specialities, including those people who are critically ill. There is no evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy affects death or major adverse events (e.g. cardiac events, myocardial infarction, stroke, pneumonia, thromboembolism, infection) compared with a liberal transfusion strategy. There is not enough information in some patient groups to say whether a restrictive or liberal transfusion threshold is better.  Single unit transfusion  This refers to transfusing a single unit or bag of red blood cells to a person who is not bleeding and haemodynamically stable followed by an assessment to see if further transfusion is required. The benefits of single unit transfusion include reduced exposure to blood products. Each unit transfused increases the associated risks of transfusion such as infection, transfusion associated circulatory overload and other side effects. Transfusion of a single unit also encourages less wastage of red blood cells.  Upper gastrointestinal bleeding  In adults with upper gastrointestinal bleeding transfusing at a higher threshold caused harm (increased risk of death and bleeding).  Heart surgery  A review established that in patients undergoing heart surgery a restrictive transfusion strategy of 70 to 80g/L (7 to 8g/dL) is safe and decreased red cell use by 24%.  Heart disease  There is less evidence available for the optimal transfusion threshold for people with heart disease, including those who are having a heart attack. Guidelines recommend a higher threshold for people with heart disease of 80g/L (8 g/dL) if they are not undergoing cardiac surgery.  Blood cancers  There is insufficient evidence to suggest how to manage anemia in people with blood cancers in terms of transfusion thresholds.  Transfusion–dependent anemia  People with thalassaemia who are transfusion dependent require a higher hemoglobin threshold to suppress their own red cell production. To do this their hemoglobin levels should not be allowed to drop below 90 to 105g/L (9 to 10.5g/dL). There is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular hemoglobin threshold in people with myelodysplasia or aplastic anemia, and guidelines recommend an individualized approach to transfusion.  Children  There is less evidence for specific transfusion thresholds in children compared to adults. There has only been one randomized trial assessing different thresholds in children, and this showed no difference between a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy. This trial used similar thresholds to the adult studies, and transfusing when the hemoglobin is less than 70g/L is also recommended in children.  Neonates  Neonatal red cell transfusion, and when it is appropriate depends on: the gestational age of the baby; how long since the baby had been born; and also on whether the baby is well or ill. Side effects  Side effects can include allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, red blood cell breakdown, fluid overload, infection, and lung injury. Giving incompatible RBCs to a person can be fatal. With current testing methods in high-income countries the risk of infection is very low.PHB Bolton-Maggs (Ed) D Poles et al. on behalf of the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) Steering Group. The 2017 Annual SHOT Report (2018).https://www.shotuk.org/wp-content/uploads/myimages/SHOT- Report-2017-WEB-Final-v3-02-8-18.pdf However, in low-income countries the risk of a blood donation being positive for HIV, hepatitis C, or syphilis is approximately 1%, and the risk of it being hepatitis B positive is approximately 4%. Although the World Health Organization recommends that all donated blood is screened for these infections, at least 13 low-income countries are unable to screen all their donated blood for at least one of these infections.  Compatibility testing  To avoid transfusion reactions, the donor and recipient blood are tested, typically ordered as a \\"type and screen\\" for the recipient. The \\"type\\" in this case is the ABO and Rh type, specifically the phenotype, and the \\"screen\\" refers to testing for atypical antibodies that might cause transfusion problems. The typing and screening are also performed on donor blood. The blood groups represent antigens on the surface of the red blood cells which might react with antibodies in the recipient. The ABO blood group system has four basic phenotypes: O, A, B, and AB. In the former Soviet Union these were called I, II, III, and IV, respectively. There are two important antigens in the system: A and B. Red cells without A or B are called type O, and red cells with both are called AB. Except in unusual cases like infants or seriously immunocompromised individuals, all people will have antibodies to any ABO blood type that isn't present on their own red blood cells, and will have an immediate hemolytic reaction to a unit that is not compatible with their ABO type. In addition to the A and B antigens, there are rare variations which can further complicate transfusions, such as the Bombay phenotype. The Rh blood group system consists of nearly around 50 different antigens, but the one of the greatest clinical interest is the \\"D\\" antigen, though it has other names and is commonly just called \\"negative\\" or \\"positive.\\" Unlike the ABO antigens, a recipient will not usually react to the first incompatible transfusion because the adaptive immune system does not immediately recognize it. After an incompatible transfusion the recipient may develop an antibody to the antigen and will react to any further incompatible transfusions. This antibody is important because it is the most frequent cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Incompatible red blood cells are sometimes given to recipients who will never become pregnant, such as males or postmenopausal women, as long as they do not have an antibody, since the greatest risk of Rh incompatible blood is to current or future pregnancies. For RBCs, type O negative blood is considered a \\"universal donor\\" as recipients with types A, B, or AB can almost always receive O negative blood safely. Type AB positive is considered a \\"universal recipient\\" because they can receive the other ABO/Rh types safely. These are not truly universal, as other red cell antigens can further complicate transfusions. There are many other human blood group systems and most of them are only rarely associated with transfusion problems. A screening test is used to identify if the recipient has any antibodies to any of these other blood group systems. If the screening test is positive, a complex set of tests must follow to identify which antibody the recipient has by process of elimination. Finding suitable blood for transfusion when a recipient has multiple antibodies or antibodies to extremely common antigens can be very difficult and time-consuming. Because this testing can take time, doctors will sometimes order a unit of blood transfused before it can be completed if the recipient is in critical condition. Typically two to four units of O negative blood are used in these situations, since they are unlikely to cause a reaction. A potentially fatal reaction is possible if the recipient has pre-existing antibodies, and uncrossmatched blood is only used in dire circumstances. Since O negative blood is not common, other blood types may be used if the situation is desperate.  Collection, processing, and use  Most frequently, whole blood is collected from a blood donation and is spun in a centrifuge. The red blood cells are denser and settle to the bottom, and the majority of the liquid blood plasma remains on the top. The plasma is separated and the red blood cells are kept with a minimal amount of fluid. Generally, an additive solution of citrate, dextrose, and adenine is mixed with the cells to keep them alive during storage. This process is sometimes done as automated apheresis, where the centrifuging and mixing take place at the donation site. Most blood banks utilize automated centrifugation systems to wash or volume reduce the blood products they produce and distribute. The other options is using the person's own blood. This is known as autologous blood transfusion. The person's red blood cells are collected and can be washed by different methods. The two main methods that are used to wash the cells are centrifugation, or filtration methods. The last option is reinfusion without washing. This is the least preferred method because of the chance of complications. Red blood cells are sometimes modified to address specific needs. The most common modification is leukoreduction, where the donor blood is filtered to remove white cells, although this is becoming increasingly universal throughout the blood supply (over 80% in the US, 100% in Europe). The blood may also be irradiated, which destroys the DNA in the white cells and prevents graft versus host disease, which may happen if the blood donor and recipient are closely related, and is also important for immunocompromized patients. Other modifications, such as washing the RBCs to remove any remaining plasma, are much less common. With additive solutions, RBCs are typically kept at refrigerated temperatures for up to 45 days. In some patients, use of RBCs that are much fresher is important; for example, US guidelines call for blood less than seven days old to be used for neonatals, to \\"ensure optimal cell function\\". However, the phenomenon of RBC storage lesion and its implications for transfusion efficacy are complex and remain controversial (see blood bank and blood transfusion articles). With the addition of glycerol or other cryoprotectants, RBCs can be frozen and thus stored for much longer (this is not common). Frozen RBCs are typically assigned a ten-year expiration date, though older units have been transfused successfully. The freezing process is expensive and time-consuming and is generally reserved for rare units such as ones that can be used in patients that have unusual antibodies. Since frozen RBCs have glycerol added, the added glycerol must be removed by washing the red blood cells using special equipment, such as the IBM 2991 cell processor in a similar manner to washing RBCs. The processing (often termed \\"manufacture\\", since the end result is deemed a biologic biopharmaceutical product) and the storage can occur at a collection center or a blood bank. RBCs are mixed with an anticoagulant and storage solution which provides nutrients and aims to preserve viability and functionality of the cells (limiting their so-called \\"storage lesion\\"), which are stored at refrigerated temperatures for up to 42 days (in the US), except for the rather unusual long-term storage in which case they can be frozen for up to 10 years. The cells are separated from the fluid portion of the blood after it is collected from a donor, or during the collection process in the case of apheresis. The product is then sometimes modified after collection to meet specific patient requirements. Name The product is typically abbreviated RBC, pRBC, PRBC, and sometimes StRBC or even LRBC (the latter being to indicate those that have been leukoreduced, which is now true for the vast majority of RBC units). The name \\"Red Blood Cells\\" with initial capitals indicates a standardized blood product in the United States. Without capitalization, it is simply generic without specifying whether or not the cells comprise a blood product, patient blood, etc. (with other generic terms for it being \\"erythrocyte\\" and \\"red cell\\").

Like most of the ships of her class, she was not originally named, and known only by her designation. From June to August 1951 she served a stint as a part of the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), manned by a civilian crew, and renamed USNS T-LST-209. She was recommissioned under her original name 24 August 1951, and renamed USS Bamberg County (LST-209) on 1 July 1955. She was named for Bamberg County, South Carolina, the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. Operational history LST-209 was laid down on 7 September 1942 at Seneca, Illinois by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company; launched on 29 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. A. Dalton; placed in reduced commission at her builder's yard on 4 June 1943; placed in full commission at New Orleans on 10 June 1943 with Lieutenant Frank J. Oberg, USNR, in command. World War II After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay, LST-209 departed American waters on 4 August 1943 and steamed via the Strait of Gibraltar for the Mediterranean coast of North Africa. On her arrival at Oran, Algeria the ship received orders to proceed to Bizerte, Tunisia where she exchanged ships' companies with on 25 August. Originally slated to sail for Algiers to load LST spare parts for shipment to the Far East, LST-209 instead received orders to Sicily due to the critical need for LSTs to carry equipment to the Italian front. In the months that followed, the tank landing ship conducted four trips between Catania, Sicily and Taranto, Italy, before she returned to Algiers for further assignment. In convoy with 10 other tank landing ships, LST-209 departed the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal and headed for India. After arriving at Calcutta during the latter part of November, she loaded 14 M3 \\"General Lee\\" tanks on 3 December and embarked 67 men of the British 14th Army before departing on 5 December, with and two British motor gunboats, bound for Regu Creek, near Arakan, Burma. Although LST-208 ran aground on the run in, LST-209 beached successfully at 23:24 on 6 December. She completed unloading the tanks within 30 minutes, retracted, and reached Calcutta in the afternoon of 9 December. A week later, LST-209 received orders to proceed to the British Isles. Departing Colombo on 28 December, the ship reached the Welsh port of Milford Haven on 12 February 1944 and, after a week of operational training, was drydocked at Cardiff. She next underwent additional training, including beaching exercises on the south coast of England. After shifting thence to Rosneath naval base, Rosneath, Scotland LST-209 received an armament conversion alongside destroyer tender , losing her single gun and receiving several 40 millimeter Bofors and 20 millimeter Oerlikon antiaircraft guns. LST-209 (right) and LST-332 loading vehicles for transport to Europe, April 1945. On completion of that refit, LST-209 sailed for Harwich, England to train for the invasion of France. She embarked various troops embarked during this period, including elements of the famed British 8th Army \\"the Desert Rats\\", the troops she carried to the continent on D-Day, 6 June 1944. After beaching on the British \\"Gold\\" Beach that day, LST-209 shuttled between French and British ports for the remainder of June to support operations in France. Reconfigured in July to lift railway cars in her capacious tank deck, LST-209 carried out this task between Southampton and Cherbourg until November 1944. From then until the German capitulation, the tank landing ship transported troops between various English ports and Le Havre and Rouen, France, and Ostend, Belgium. Following the end of the war with Germany, LST-209 received orders to return to the United States on 14 June 1945. Reaching Norfolk, Virginia on 1 July 1945 with PT-460 as cargo and former USAAF prisoners of war as passengers, LST-209 shifted from the Tidewater region of Virginia to New York where she unloaded the motor torpedo boat. She then headed back to New Orleans, whence her voyages had commenced two years before. At Mobile, Alabama work began to update her to the configuration of the improved , but the end of the War prompted a cancellation of some of the alterations originally planned. Post-war When the amended refitting had been completed by the Alabama Dry Dock and Shipbuilding Company, she proceeded to New Orleans for inspection. LST-209 then carried out shakedown training out of Galveston, Texas, before returning to New Orleans in mid-October 1945. Sent to the St. Johns River in Florida, the tank landing ship reported to the inactive fleet on 28 October 1945 and was decommissioned and placed in reserve on 27 June 1946. The ship was placed in service as USNS T-LST-209 on 19 June 1951 with a civilian crew and assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), Atlantic. She participated in Project \\"Bluejay\\" that July, a cold-weather exercise that took place in Arctic waters. While she was at sea, participating in these evolutions, it was decided that the ship be reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet with a military crew when released by MSTS from her present employment. Released from MSTS service upon her arrival at Norfolk on 5 August 1951, LST-209 shifted from there to Charleston, South Carolina where she was formally turned over to the Commander, Mine Force, Atlantic, on 11 August 1951. She was then placed in commission on 24 August 1951 with Lieutenant John E. Cridland in command. As the flagship for the Commander, Mine Squadron (MinRon) 4, LST-209 resumed active operations in November 1951 after receiving such repairs and alterations as were necessary to enable her to function as a mine squadron flagship. These changes did not alter her basic tank landing ship lines. Clearing Charleston on 8 November, LST-209 took part in amphibious exercises off Onslow Beach, functioning as flagship and control ship for minesweeping operations. In the course of these evolutions, she became one of the first LST's to operate helicopters from her main deck. For the next half decade the ship operated with the mine force based at Charleston. Her tank deck was altered in 1953 to allow the ship to function as a support vessel for MSC(0) type minesweepers. During this period, LST-209 was renamed USS Bamberg County (LST-209) on 1 July 1955. Decommissioned again at Green Cove Springs, Florida on 10 December 1956, Bamberg County never again saw active service with the Navy. Deemed \\"unfit for further naval service\\" on 28 October 1958 her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1958. Sold to Tolchester Lines, Inc., of Arlington, Virginia soon thereafter, she was acquired by the Dravo Corporation of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on 23 February 1961 for use at that firm's Baton Rouge, Louisiana facility, where she was eventually scrapped. Bamberg County earned one battle star for her World War II service.

According to Ethnologue, they numbered 13,249 in 1999. Much of what is known about the Kwaio is due to the work of the anthropologist Roger M. Keesing, who lived among them starting in the 1960s. Their main mode of economic activity was traditionally subsistence farming of taro, which could be planted and harvested continuously in swidden agriculture. Other important crops include yams and plantains. Birds, insects, fish, and cuscus were occasional additions to what was mainly a vegetarian diet. Taro production suffered in a severe blight in the 1950s, and has been replaced by the sweet potato, a food of much lower prestige.Keesing, 28. Kwaio settlement was traditionally in very small settlements dotted close together. Missionary activity, predominantly in coastal areas, has encouraged the growth of larger settlements. According to oral tradition, the land was first cleared 1200 to 2000 years ago. The tracts cleared at this time are marked by shrines, and in effect established title for the clans descended agnatically from these ancestors. In practice, other non-agnatic descendants have secondary rights to the land, which may be strengthened by residence, especially during childhood, and participation in the descent groups' affairs. Because people can have claims in several different descent groups, land rights have some degree of flexibility.Keesing, 16-18. Kwaio have been more resistant than other nearby peoples in the continuation of their beliefs. The traditional religion is a form of ancestor worship, which recognizes the power of the deceased to intervene in affairs. There are strict rules regarding taboo (Kwaio: abu), and violations of them must be redressed with sacrifices. One example of a powerful ancestral force is La'aka, fear of whom led to the Maasina Ruru movement. Kwaio were first brought into contact with the outside world in 1868, when two men were taken from their canoe, and then returned bearing steel tools, novelty items, and stories about their experience. Within a small amount of time, many young Kwaio sought the adventures, and were brought to sugarcane plantations in Queensland and on Fiji for their labor. The appearance of steel (replacing rough chert blades) and firearms revolutionized the Kwaio way of life, as leisure time was greatly increased by the new tools and blood feuds escalated. Kwaio also attempted to avenge the deaths of those who died overseas, and they earned a reputation as a fierce and dangerous group. Missionaries from the South Seas Evangelical Church were brought to support those in Queensland who had become Christians there, and enclaves were established in the lowlands. The efforts of the Australian District Officer William R. Bell were to pacify the area and establish means to collect a head tax, and capitulate to the British colonial regime. On his fifth annual tax collection, in October 1927, he was killed, along with one other white man and 13 Solomon Islanders in his charge. A massive punitive expedition, known as the Malaita massacre ensued; at least 60 people were killed,Keesing and Corris, 178. and nearly 200 detained in Tulagi (the then capital), where 30 further died from dysentery and other problems.Keesing and Corris, 184. Furthermore, relatives of the slain Solomon Islanders sought spiritual revenge by the deliberate desecration of sacred sites and objects, which is seen by surviving elders as the origin of many of the struggles the people have suffered in recent times, including epidemics, the breakdown of traditional morality, and the Taro leaf blight.Keesing and Corris, 202-203 Kwaio culture was greatly transformed, but after several years was able to regain its traditional practices and social structure. However, there is more personal independence for younger people and blood feuding is no longer practiced. NotesReferences * Roger M. Keesing. Kwaio Religion.

The history of Saginaw, Michigan explores the development of the city from the time that Native American hunter-gatherers ranged through the area. There was little settlement, though, until the 19th century when the marshes were drained to alleviate the endemic mosquito infestation. The site of what later became the city of Saginaw was originally inhabited by the Anishnabeg. French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the Ojibwe (Chippewa) living in the area. Because of convenient means of travel to the area by rivers, streams, and Lake Huron, the area was one of the sites of councils of The Three Fires: Ojibwe, Pottawatomi, and Ottawa. Henri Nouvel, a Jesuit missionary visited the area in the 17th century and recorded his travels in a journal. A trading post was established by Louis Campeau in 1816. The Treaty of Saginaw in 1819 cleared the way for settlement by white people. To control the Ojibwe in the region, the United States government established Fort Saginaw in 1822, but the mosquito infestation and humidity was so severe that the fort was closed in 1824. Campau platted a town, but few lots were sold for some time. Also in 1822, Saginaw County was established. Saginaw realized significant growth due to the lumber industry boom of the 19th century. Two cities had been established Saginaw City and East Saginaw, which were consolidated into the current city of Saginaw in March, 1890. The city grew substantially as automotive manufacturers opened plants in Saginaw and when the city answered the call to produce munitions and motor vehicle parts during World War II. African-Americans migrated from the south for manufacturing jobs and Saginaw saw a significant change in the demographics within the city, which created racial tensions that affected the political climate and opportunities for African-Americans, such as the ability to purchase houses. In the late 20th century, the city began to decline economically as the number of manufacturing jobs declined significantly and the rate of unemployment increased dramatically. More recently, economic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/07/0223_michigan_mid_metros.pdf Early history=Native People Map of Saginaw River systemChicago Roadalt= Map The area of the present City of Saginaw was inhabited from about 1000 B.C. to 1000 A.D. by Hopewell Woodland Native Americans, followed by the Anishnabeg. Some historians believe that the Sauk at one time lived in the area and were driven out by Ojibwe (Chippewa), before the area was first visited by Europeans. https://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/micounty/BAD1164.0001.001?rgn=main;view=fulltext The Saginaw region includes an extensive network of many rivers and streams which converge into the Saginaw River and provided a means for easy travel for the Native American population among numerous settlements and hunting areas, as well as access to Lake Huron. Saginaw was also a frequent meeting location for councils of the Ojibwe, Ottawa and Pottawatomi--the Three Fires of the Anishnabeg. The name of the area as Saginaw most likely comes from the Ojibwe words meaning 'place of the outlet' from sag (opening) and ong (place of). The present City of Saginaw itself served as a location for only semi-permanent settlement until the time of European contact. This may be due, in part, to the low lying and frequently flooding land adjacent to the Saginaw River, much of which was marshland prior to being drained in the 19th century. Mosquito infestation was endemic to the area.Saginaw's Changeable Past, Jeremy W. Kilar, G. Bradley, St.Louis, MO, 1994, p. 15 French missionaries French missionaries first reached the area in the 17th century. Henri Nouvel, a Jesuit missionary who made repeated visits to the Native Americans present in the area, is of particular significance. He recorded information concerning his travels during the 1670s in his journals. Territory of the United States The French controlled the territory consisting of the present day State of Michigan until it was ceded to the British following the Seven Years' War in 1763. The French established permanent settlements in many locations throughout the Great Lakes, but most of the interior of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, including the Saginaw River valley, was undeveloped. Both the French and the British primarily maintained settlements for trade and strategic defense, neither of which provided much reason to develop the Saginaw region. Following the British defeat during the American Revolutionary War, Michigan was officially ceded by treaty to the United States in 1784. Despite this, the British remained in de facto control of the area for long after. It was not until after the conclusion of the War of 1812 that all presence of British military was removed from what is present-day Michigan. 19th century Map showing cession of Indian Lands by Saginaw Treaty of 1819 Trading post The first permanent white settlement in the area was a fur-trading post on the west side of the Saginaw River established in 1816 by Louis Campau. The U.S. federal government extinguished Native American interests for most of the land in the area with the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819, clearing the way for white settlers. Fort Saginaw In 1822, the trading post was used by the U.S. Army to establish Fort Saginaw to control the actions of the Ojibwe in the region.History of Saginaw County, Michigan, p. 164 Due to the undesirable conditions of intense humidity and mosquito infestation, the Fort was abandoned by 1824. Saginaw city and county Territorial Governor Lewis Cass On September 10, 1822, Territorial Governor Lewis Cass issued a proclamation that set off the boundaries of Saginaw County, although it remained attached to Oakland County for administrative purposes until there was sufficient population to organize a separate government. The county boundaries initially included what is now the southern portion of Bay County and Midland County and the northwest corner of Shiawassee County. Campau platted the town in 1823 under the name \\"Town of Sagana\\" but few plots were sold. The town languished for most of the following decade, but was re-platted in December 1830, comprising river front from Cass St. on the south to Harrison St. and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the Panic of 1837 dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 out of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841. Many of the early Euro- American settlers of Saginaw married Ojibwe women. For example, Jacob Gradroot, a native of Germany who was the first European or Euro-American to settle permanently along the Saginaw River below Fort Saginaw, married a daughter of the Ojibwe leader Kishkawko.History of Saginaw County, Michigan (Chicago: Charles A. Chapman, 1881) p. 161. In 1831, the northwest corner of Saginaw County was detached to become a part of Midland County. In 1835, the southeast corner was detached to become a part of Genesee County. In 1857, the northern portion was detached to become a part of Bay County, although the precise alignment of the northern boundary shifted several more times in subsequent years. On July 12, 1830, the Territorial Legislature passed an act that erected the Township of Saginaw, effective with the first town meeting on April 4, 1831. The township comprised all of Saginaw County, which at the time was still attached to Oakland County. On January 28, 1835, the Territorial Legislature passed an act organizing county government in Saginaw County, effective on February 9, 1835. Four years before the county government was organized, another proclamation by Governor Cass on January 11, 1831, located the county seat at what was to become the City of Saginaw. The settlement was which had been platted for that purpose by a group of area residents. Lumber boom The main cause for the development of Saginaw was the lumber needs of the growing American nation. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to water transportation provided by the Saginaw River and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being felled in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, then to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars. Multiple settlements comprise what now is the present-day City of Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as the City of Saginaw in 1857 and contained the seat of Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of the City of East Saginaw on the east bank of the river the village of Salina formed. Its name relates to the salty brine that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River. Also on the east side of the river was Florece, another sawmill settlement, that was eventually absorbed into Saginaw.Walter Romig, Michigan Place names, p. 200 Lumber production peaked by the early 1870s and had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries supporting the area's agriculture and manufacturing developed. Consolidation of west and east sides Cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw, Michigan, 1885 before they were consolidated into Saginaw in March, 1890 On June 28, 1889, the Michigan Legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the City of Saginaw and the City of East Saginaw into a new city that also was named the City of Saginaw. Prior to this consolidation, the village of Salina had already been added to the City of East Saginaw. The consolidation of the City of Saginaw became effective with the election of officers on March 12, 1890. The provisions of the city charter were established by the same act of the legislature that provided for the consolidation. The city was governed by a city council consisting of two aldermen elected from 21 wards and an executive mayor who had fairly weak powers because numerous other elected officials and elected or appointed boards controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the City's government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between the east and west sides of the City of Saginaw persisted throughout the ensuing century in various forms, and influences Saginaw's political and economic experiences even at the present time. 20th century=Industrial economy Lufkin Rule Manufacturing Plant, Saginaw, 1918 At the dawn of the 20th century, production of motor vehicles became prolific throughout many communities in Michigan, but most notably Detroit. In Saginaw, the Jackson, Wilcox and Church Company produced carriages to be drawn by horses, and later produced components used in motor vehicles. The company was eventually acquired by General Motors and formed the basis for its Steering Gear division. Additionally, General Motors established foundries and other manufacturing facilities in Saginaw. The early development of automotive production within Saginaw would set the course for the future economic circumstances of the City. Home Rule government After a new state constitution was adopted in 1908 that mandated increased home rule powers for local units of government, the legislature enacted the Home Rule Cities Act in 1909. Under this statute, cities are permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and are given great flexibility in structuring local government. The government under the 1889 Charter had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval that followed the commission form of city government that was popular in many American cities in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners each elected separately at-large who served both as the city council and the executive heads of city government departments. One of the commissioners served as mayor, a mostly ceremonial role. In 1935, the voted adopted a charter based upon the council-manager form of government. The charter, which took effect in 1936, gave overall responsibility for city government administration to the city manager, who was accountable to a nine-member city council. The system was designed to address administrative inefficiency and political tensions associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards as well as disputes that arose between the east and west sides of the city. 20th century boom An example of a WW II M1 Carbine with a magazine pouch mounted on the stock that held two spare 15-round magazines As the United States entered the conflict of World War II, Saginaw's industrial complex was geared towards production supporting the war effort. Munitions and components for military vehicles made Saginaw a significant contributor to the nation's eventual victory. Specifically, Saginaw was home to one production facility that produced over half a million M1 Carbine rifles for the US Military during World War II. Saginaw became the destination for a great number of workers migrating from areas of the United States that were greatly devastated by the Great Depression, especially from the south. This migration continued throughout the war years and in the economic boom, which followed. Saginaw, like most of America, benefited from the dramatic economic prosperity following the war. General Motors expanded its presence in Saginaw, and other manufacturers increased production as well. This caused the population of the City to swell to its height of approximately 100,000 during the 1960s. The needs of a growing city were met by significant investment in Saginaw's infrastructure. Notably, Saginaw constructed a water supply pipeline drawing water from Lake Huron in 1947 to meet the anticipated needs of the community. In addition, the cities of Midland and Bay City along with Saginaw jointly developed and began to operate an airport facility in nearby Tittabawassee Township that is now MBS International Airport. Late 20th century In the years following World War II, the legislature of the State of Michigan enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing adjacent territory contained within townships. Townships, which had historically served a rural population, were given the ability to provide nearly all of the same services that an incorporated city can. Residential growth in neighboring townships led the City of Saginaw to provide water under long-term contracts to such other units of government. This increased the ability of adjacent townships to further develop. The unintended consequence of this was that the city of Saginaw stopped growing in population and new housing development slowed significantly. As a result of migrations of workers from other parts of the United States, particularly the south, Saginaw's African-American population expanded significantly in proportion to those of European ancestry. Attitudes of racism promoted the segregation of African-American residents into concentrated neighborhoods almost exclusively within the city's east side. Mortgage lenders and real estate sales agents enacted redlining tactics to control where African-Americans lived. Gradually most of the east side's white population migrated either to the west side or to adjacent townships. The Saginaw River became seen as a dividing line for segregated racial groups in Saginaw. As a result emphasis of political campaigns have focused on racial tensions, public services, and blight. After the eventual breakdown of institutionally enforced segregation and increased opportunities for African- Americans, however, the west side has become significantly more diverse in its ethnic and racial composition and no longer has almost exclusively white residents. Rusted equipment in the Saginaw Yard on Lansing Manufacturers Railroad The decline of manufacturing jobs has resulted in high rates of unemployment. There has been a decline in property values, which has reduced the city's revenue that is collected through property taxes. Saginaw has experienced a significant rate of crime activity while at the same time being forced to decrease the size of its police department. Overall, the number of employees and size and scope of city government is now nearly half of its level during the 1970s. Currently, economic development is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a disproportionately high number of patents per employee, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs in comparison to the US.https://www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/07/0223_michigan_mid_metros.pdf Gallery Hoyt Public Library built in 1887 Castle Museum of Saginaw County History.

It may be more or less clearly distinguished from hymnody, the creation and practice of such song. Hymnologists, such as Erik Routley, may study the history and origins of hymns and of traditions of sung worship, the biographies of the women and men who have written hymns that have passed into choral or congregational use, the interrelationships between text and tune, the historical processes, both folk and redactional, that have changed hymn texts and hymn tunes over time, and the sociopolitical, theological and aesthetic arguments concerning various styles of sung worship. Hymnology is not an \\"-ology\\" in the usual sense of an independent discipline that has a proper set of concepts and critical vocabulary that must first be learned before progress can be made.In philosophical terms, it is analogous to the situation described in Plato's dialogue Gorgias: is rhetoric an art (techne) with a logos? Or, does it rely on having a knack derived from experience? Rather, it's two disciplines: one that studies the texts and follows the rules of literary scholarship, the other that is trained in music and follows the rules of musicology. The \\"-ology\\" just means that they might publish in the same journals, occasionally attend the same conferences, or be asked to serve on a hymnal committee. If they write about the interaction between music and text, this is purely by instinct: there is no \\"scholarly consensus\\" for an underlying set of principles about how the interaction can be optimized. Often, the term \\"hymnologist\\" simply refers to anyone who has enough standing within the faith community to be asked to serve on a hymnal committee. Hymnology is sometimes more strictly construed, as in A Dictionary of Hymnology,John Julian, ed., (1902/1985), A Dictionary of Hymnology, Grand Rapids, MI: Kregel. edited by John D. Julian, which concerns itself very largely with the history, textual changes, and translations of hymns, and with the biographies of hymnographers, and very little with the poetic metres of these hymns, or with the hymn tunes to which these are sung.

First published in Polish, the collection was translated into English by Celina Wieniewska in 1963. Origins and publication Schulz's earliest literary endeavors can probably be dated back to 1925.Heuckelom, Kris Van. p.464: \\"When Schulz turned to writing around 1925...\\" They included rough drafts of the short stories, later published in the collection The Street of Crocodiles, which the writer used to send to his friends Władysław Riff and Debora Vogel. Although it was already in 1928 that Schultz wrote the short story A July Night, it was included in the second volume entitled Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass which was published in 1937. All Debora Vogel's efforts to have Schulz's works published were in vain. It was only after the well-known writer Zofia Nałkowska, from whom Schulz had sought help, expressed her support for him that the work was published in December 1933, dated 1934. Title The original title of the collection can be literally translated into English as \\"Cinnamon Shops.\\" There is also a short story with the same title included in the collection. Cinnamon shops mentioned by the narrator of the story are situated in the centre of the town where the narrator lives. Plot An illustration by Bruno Schulz. The collection tells the story of a merchant family from a small Galician town which resembles the writer's home town, Drohobycz, in many respects. The story abounds in mythical elements, introduced by means of the visionary and dreamlike literary depiction (e.g. frequently occurring motif of labyrinths), characteristic of the writer. It is thus mythologized reality, processed by the imagination, artistically distorted and enriched by all possible references and allusions to other literary works, to great myths, to other, more exotic domains of reality.Jerzy Jarzębski: Prowincja centrum. Przypisy do Schulza, Wydawnictwo Literackie, Kraków 2005, s. 22. . One of the most significant characters in the work is the Father, who is not only the head of the family, a merchant running a textile shop in the marketplace, but also a mad experimenter endowed with superhuman abilities, a demiurge living between life and death, between the world of the real and the imaginary. Despite the literary fascination with the character of the Father displayed by Schulz, it is Józef whom he renders the work's protagonist and narrator. In the character of this young boy, eagerly discovering the world that surrounds him, many of Schulz's own traits are clearly visible. Another is Adela, the servant girl. She is a dominant woman and object of desire. She controls and threatens the Father, on one occasion freeing all of the birds he has collected in the attic, driving them away with her broom. Language The language adopted by Schulz is rich and unique, marked by various eccentric sequences of metaphors.Jerzy Jarzębski, Wstęp..., s. XXXVI. The metaphors perform diverse functions; the writer brings inanimate objects into existence and presents people as animals. He uses multiple complex sentences, employs unfamiliar, old-fashioned and long forgotten words as well as scientific (e.g. biological) terminology. These techniques caught the attention of and were discussed already by the first critics of Schulz, including Tadeusz Breza. Schulz's prose in the original Polish is full of Latinisms, arguably derived from the bureaucratic language of the Austro- Hungarian Empire. He drew on these words instead of more familiar Slavic terms to de-familiarise the text. Critical reception The short story collection was well received by such writers and literary critics as Leon Piwiński, Tadeusz Breza (he defined Schulz's writing as uniquely beautiful and the true essence of poetry),Czytanie Schulza: materiały międzynarodowej sesji naukowej Bruno Schulz − w stulecie urodzin i pięćdziesięciolecie śmierci. Instytut Filologii Polskiej Uniwersytetu Jagiellońskiego, Kraków, 8–10 czerwca 1992. Oficyna Naukowa i Literacka T.I.C., Kraków, 1994, s. 6. Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, Antoni Słonimski, Julian Tuwim and Adolf Nowaczyński. The majority of critics valued the work mainly due to its linguistic features, yet there were also some (e.g. Witkacy) who were enthralled by the metaphysical aspects of the stories. The work was frequently mentioned as one of the nominees for the award of the weekly literary magazine Wiadomości Literackie. However, there were some negative and reproachful reviews as well, produced mainly by the rightist and leftist press, which disapproved of the avant-garde nature of the work. Schulz’s writing was criticized in the negative reviews for \\"mannerism\\" and \\"uselessness.\\" Titles of the short stories * August * Visitation * Birds * Tailors' Dummies * Treatise on Tailors' Dummies or the Second Book of Genesis * Treatise on Tailors' Dummies: Continuation * Treatise on Tailors' Dummies: Conclusion * Nimrod * Pan * Mr. Charles * Cinnamon Shops * The Street of Crocodiles * Cocroaches * The Gale * The Night of the Great Season * The Comet Adaptations A 1986 Brothers Quay stop-motion animation, Street of Crocodiles, is based on the book.

This latter adaptation was first staged in August 1992 at the Cottesloe Theatre at the National Theatre in London; it toured throughout 1992 and 1993 and was nominated for four Olivier Awards. In 2010, the British Intellect publishes Katarzyna Marciniak and Kamil Turowski's photo album, Streets of Crocodiles: Photography, Media, and Postsocialist Landscapes in Poland. The book, inspired by Schulz's short story and available in print and electronic formats, is introduced by The Village Voice film critic, J. Hoberman, as \\"...a walk on the wild side, an expedition down a melancholy boulevard of dreams.\\" Jonathan Safran Foer's Tree of Codes is an adaptation of Street of Crocodiles in the tradition of Tom Phillips's book A Humument. Safran Foer cut words from Street of Crocodiles in order to create his own story. Foer's novel has been turned into a full-length contemporary ballet by Wayne McGregor and was commissioned by and premiered at the Manchester International Festival on Friday 3 July 2015 in the city's Opera House theatre.

She is mainly known for presenting television programmes combining food and travel (Planet Food and Full on Food) as well as various more traditional cookery programmes. Parker is also renowned for the menu she presented working for the pub The Lansdowne in Primrose Hill in London. Many of her recipes are freely available online. Early life Parker was already passionate about cooking as a young girl, at which time she helped her grandmother, who is half-Portuguese, in the kitchen. She lives in the United Kingdom and speaks French fluently. She is married with two children, a girl and a boy. Parker has developed several career paths in parallel, mainly involving cooking. Television presenter In 1996, she began her career in television as a researcher on the BBC cookery programme Ready Steady Cook. She also researched for Channel 4. She began presenting in 1997 on a television programme called Barbecue Bible, in which she was credited as the Home Economist. Parker became a familiar face as a television chef in 1999 on a long-running BBC series Anything You Can Cook, which she presented together with Brian Turner. In 2001, she was the regular chef on the BBC day-time show House Call. In 2005, she presented the BBC programme Full on Food, together with Heston Blumenthal and Richard Corrigan. For this programme, she travelled to various cultures to sample their traditional cooking. Amongst the most memorable and inspiring locations she visited for the programme, Parker mentions Hanoi and Peru. For the programme Planet Food, she made several more travel and cookery documentaries in which she visited one country or region per episode, met with interesting local chefs and tasted local foods. Inter alia, she visited the Caribbean, Germany, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, and Scandinavia. Parker also co-presented Orgasmic Organic and Great Food Live. She appeared on Taste, for British Sky Broadcasting, and on Saturday Kitchen, for the BBC. In 2006, Parker co-presented Food Uncut on UKTV Food with Stefan Gates and Jean-Christophe Novelli. She appeared as a guest chef on Daily Cooks and Saturday Cooks on ITV in 2007, and, in 2008, appeared regularly as a contestant on Daily Cooks Challenge. In 2007, she was a judge on the ITV1 cooking show, Soapstar Superchef. On 10 August 2008, Parker presented a documentary on Channel 4 called 'Kill it Skin it Wear it'. The publicity for the show stated: \\"Chef Merrilees Parker admits to liking fur, but can she kill it, skin it and still wear it? She wants to find out if it's possible to source ethical fur as we source ethical food.\\" Chef At the age of 17, Parker worked as a chalet girl in France, where she impressed the chef. Upon returning to the UK, Parker worked for The Eagle which was the first gastropub in London. Later, she opened her own gastropub. Parker has been the chef at The Lansdowne in Primrose Hill in London. Here she developed her personal cooking style and received good reviews. She was head chef at The Greyhound in Sonning Common. While working for Antony Worrall Thompson's company, Wiz Events, Parker provided consultancy for his restaurants and catered for several events and cookery demonstrations. She now runs her own catering company called Pink, together with Bernadette Fitzpatrick, also of Worrall Thompson's company. Magazines Parker has been contributing to the BBC print magazine Good Food since 2002 and also contributes to Olive. Style=Presenting style In her travel documentaries, she tastes local foods, even if they may sometimes look unappealing to western eyes. She does not believe eating from street restaurants is risky, stating, \\"if something is cooked in front of you in a hot wok it's less likely to give you food poisoning than something that has been sitting on a lukewarm buffet.\\" Cooking style She emphasises the need to adapt to the target audience, mentioning that for a children's birthday party, she creates food that is visually interesting and fun to eat, rather than being geared towards adult palates. Her company Pink promotes as one of its distinguishing features its range, going from posh clubs via corporate events to children's parties. Charity In 2007, Parker joined the Westminster Arctic Challenge. This charity event raised awareness and money for several causes. The participants included several members of parliament, representatives of the charities, and a journalist. The participants went on a challenging sponsored trek to the Arctic on husky-powered sledges.

He examined the bullet casings in the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre and showed that the guns used were not police issued weapons, leading the investigators to conclude it was a mob hit. Biography He was born in Baltimore, Maryland. After graduating from the Boys' Latin School of Maryland in 1907, Goddard graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1911 from the Johns Hopkins University and then earned a medical degree and graduated in 1915. He joined the United States Army and became a Colonel. He was also a professor of police science at Northwestern University and the Military Editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica. He was also the editor of the American Journal of Police Science, America's first scientific police journal. Colonel Goddard commanded the US Army Crime Laboratory in Japan for a number of years after World War II.Dr. James Edward Hamby, Colonel Calvin H. Goddard Award acceptance speech, June 29, 2006 Calvin Goddard brought professionalism, the use of the scientific method, and reliability to Forensic Firearm Identification, at a time when charlatanism was rampant in this field. His testimony in 1923 in the Frye case and others, paved the way for judicial acceptance of Firearms Identification.John Murdock, Calvin Goddard Award acceptance speech June 23, 2005. According to Goddard's grandson, he may have been the only army officer who served in four branches: Ordnance Corps, Military Police Corps, Medical Corps and became a Military Historian.Olivier Perreault-Smith, LL.B, Media & Public Relations Coordinator, Forensic Technology Inc. Montreal,Canada He died on 22 February 1955. Forensic ballistics In 1925 Goddard wrote an article for the Army Ordnance titled \\"Forensic Ballistics\\" in which he described the use of the comparison microscope regarding firearms investigations. He is generally credited with the conception of the term \\"forensic ballistics\\", though he later admitted it to be an inadequate name for the science. In April 1925, Major At that time he was a major in the Army, later promoted to colonel. Also, he is referred to in the book The Untouchables as \\"Major Goddard\\" because that's what he was in the 1930s. Goddard established the Bureau of Forensic Ballistics in New York City with C. E. Waite, Philip O. Gravelle and John H. Fisher. The Bureau was formed to provide firearms identification services throughout America. Goddard researched, authored and spoke extensively on the subject of forensic ballistics and firearms identification, becoming the internationally renowned pioneer in forensic ballistics. The Bureau of Forensic Ballistics was the United States’ first independent criminalistics laboratory, which Goddard headed, and where ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were brought under one roof. When the lab began publishing the American Journal of Police Science, which was edited by Colonel Goddard, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover strongly encouraged his special agents in charge to subscribe to it and he supplied articles on fingerprint issues and Bureau responsibilities to the journal. The following year the Bureau contributed three articles for the journal's series entitled “Organized Protection Against Organized Crime”. Hoover also sent a number of representatives to a symposium that Goddard sponsored on scientific crime detection. He was also an advisor to FBI when they set up a similar forensic laboratory. Comparison Microscope Philip O. Gravelle developed the comparison microscope for the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of Major Calvin H. Goddard. It was a giant leap in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \\"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He invented the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\\"Jurgen Thorwald, The Century of the Detective, New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1964 Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing the importance of stereo-microscope in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic uses. Sacco and Vanzetti Case Nicola Sacco and Bartolommeo Vanzetti were two Italian-born American anarchists, who were arrested for the murder of security guard Alessandro Berardelli and the robbery of US$15,766.51 from the factory's payroll in South Braintree, Massachusetts during the afternoon of April 15, 1920. During the trial a worldwide outcry arose, with the firm belief based on railroaded justice and racial prejudice. On April 8, 1927, their appeals exhausted, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that an automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Major Calvin Goddard in 1927.Goddard, Calvin H. (Maj.), Who Did The Shooting?, Popular Science, Vol. 111 No. 5, (November 1927), pp. 21-22, 171 Major Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Savage Model 1907, the bullet that allegedly killed Berardelli, and the spent casings allegedly recovered from the scene of the crime. (Defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti claim that the bullet and cartridge case linked to Sacco's pistol were substituted for genuine evidence by the Massachusetts police.) In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired several test bullets from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and prepared them for a comparative examination. He then put the ejected shell casings on the comparison microscope next to casings recovered at the South Braintree murder scene. Then he analyzed them carefully. The third bullet, designated Bullet III matched the rifling marks found on the barrel of Sacco's pistol, while firing pin marks on a .32 spent casing recovered from the murder scene matched a test shell casing known to have been fired from Sacco's pistol. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were found guilty and executed via electrocution in Massachusetts on August 23, 1927. Later Investigations One piece of evidence supporting the possibility of Sacco's guilt arose in 1941 when anarchist leader Carlo Tresca, a member of the Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee, told Max Eastman, \\"Sacco was guilty but Vanzetti was innocent.\\" Eastman published an article recounting his conversation with Tresca in National Review in 1961. Later, others would confirm being told the same information by Tresca, but Tresca's daughter insisted she never told him. Others pointed to an ongoing feud between Tresca and the Galleanists, claiming the famous anarchist was just trying to get even. In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's pistol. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 ACP taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings, however, supporters of innocence have disputed both tests, nothing that ballistics experts conducting the first test had claimed Sacco's guilt even before the tests, and that by the 1980s, the old bullets and guns were far too rusty to prove anything. There was also no evidence Sacco had fired the gun. The relevance of this evidence was challenged in 1987 when Charlie Whipple, a former Globe editorial page editor, stated that while working as a reporter back in 1937, he had a conversation with Boston Police Sergeant Edward J. Seibolt.Whipple, Charles L., A Reporter Illuminates Shady Evidence in Sacco-Vanzetti Testimony, Nieman Reports, Northwestern University, Vol. 43 (Winter 1987) According to Whipple, Seibolt told him that he was part of a \\"father-and-son ballistics team\\" who had worked on the Sacco and Vanzetti case, and that \\"we switched the murder weapon in that case.\\" When Whipple asked why, Seibolt replied \\"we suspected the other side of switching weapons, so we just switched them back.\\" When Whipple asked if he could print Seibolt's statement, Seibolt replied \\"If you do, I'll call you a liar.\\" Whipple's story remained unsubstantiated, as Seibolt died in 1961 and never corroborated the story. Moreover, police records indicate that Seibolt was only a Patrolman at the time of the Sacco and Vanzetti trial, and did not earn a promotion to Sergeant and a position as a ballistics expert with the Boston Police Department until October 1935.State of Massachusetts, Public documents of Massachusetts, Volume 3, p. 89 A full transcript of the hearings, on microfilm at Harvard Law School, shows that Judge Webster Thayer made no determination as to who had switched the barrels, but merely ordered the rusty barrel restored to Sacco's pistol.Thorwald, Jürgen, The Century of the Detective, New York: Harcourt, Brace, & World, , (1965), p. 445 Sacco's pistol is also claimed to have passed in and out of police custody, and to have been dismantled several times, both in 1924 prior to the gun barrel switch, and again between 1927 and 1961. The main problem with these charges is that the match to Sacco's gun was based not only the .32 pistol, but also to the same-caliber bullet that killed Berardelli, as well as to spent casings found at the scene. In addition to tampering with the pistol, the gun switcher/dismantler would also have had to access police evidence lockers and exchange the bullet from Berardelli's body and all spent casings retrieved by police, or else locate the actual murder weapon, then switch barrel, firing pin, ejector, and extractor, all before Goddard's examination in 1927 when the first match was made to Sacco's gun. However, skeptics of Sacco's guilt have repeatedly pointed to a single anomaly — that several witnesses to the crime insisted the gunman, alleged to be Sacco, fired four bullets into Berardelli. \\"He shot at Berardelli probably four or five times,\\" one witness said. \\"He stood guard over him.” If this was true, many ask, how could only one of the fatal bullets be linked to Sacco's gun? In 1927, the defense raised the suggestion that the fatal bullet had been planted, calling attention to the awkward scratches on the base of the bullet that differed from those on other bullets. The Lowell Commission dismissed this claim as desperate but in 1985, historians William Kaiser and David Young made a compelling case for a switch in their book \\"Post-Mortem: New Evidence in the Case of Sacco and Vanzetti.\\" References Category:Ballistics experts Category:1891 births Category:1955 deaths Category:American forensic scientists Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:Scientists from Baltimore Category:20th-century American scientists ","title":"Calvin Hooker Goddard"},{"id":"10445388","text":"Bullfrogs and Butterflies is a series of Agapeland related Christian albums by the musical group Candle.

Travel and trade along the Silk Road brought ancient texts and mind practices deep into the West. Vedic psychology dates back 5000 years and forms the core of mental health counselling in the Ayurvedic medical tradition. The knowledge that enlightened Siddhartha Gautama was the self-management of mental suffering through mindfulness awareness practices. Humane interpersonal care of the mentally disturbed was practiced in the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and later in the West.MIND (2004) Notes on the history of mental health care Mind factsheets Many of the founders of clinical psychology were influenced by these ancient texts as translations began to reach Europe during the 19th century.  Historical clinical psychologists  The historical practice of clinical psychology may be distinguished from the modern profession of clinical psychology. The Greek word psyche means 'breath' or 'soul', while -logy (from logos, meaning 'speech') means 'study of'. Psyche was the Greek goddess of the soul. An early use of the word clinic was to describe 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed' (Webster 1913).http://www.dictionary.net/clinic. In contemporary use it usually describes another kind of cleansing and rebirth – a non-hospital, healthcare facility for rehabilitation in the community. Patanjali was one of the founders of the yoga tradition, sometime between 200 and 400 BC (pre- dating Buddhist psychology) and a student of the Vedas. He developed the science of breath and mind and wrote his knowledge in the form of between 194 and 196 aphorisms called the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. These remain one of the only scientific books written in poetic form. He is reputed to have used yoga therapeutically for anxiety, depression and mental disorders as common then as now. Padmasam-bhava developed Tibetan psychiatry Padmasambhava was the 8th- century medicine Buddha of Tibet, called from the then Buddhist India to tame the Tibetans, and was instrumental in developing Tibetan psychiatric medicine.Clifford, T 'Tibetan buddhist medicine and psychiatry' Samuel Wiser (1984) including charts of Tibetan psychopharmacology and translation of three chapters of the 8th Century text Gyu-Zhi Tibetans were diplomats, counselors, traders, warriors and military tacticians in the Royal courts of East and West. Through these means they introduced arts of war and medicine to the west. Rhazes was a Persian physician and scholar of the Middle Ages who had a profound effect on Western thought and medicine as well as the invention of alcohol and of sulfur drugs. He applied the psychology of self-esteem in clinical treatment of his patients (predating Nathaniel Branden by over a thousand years). He opened the first hospital ward for humane treatment of the mentally ill. Avicenna's Canon of Medicine was a standard medical text in many European universities for 500 years. He performed psychotherapy without conversing, by observing the movement of a patient's pulse as the patient recounted broken hearted anguish, reported in 'The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi' by Afzal Iqbal, A. J. Arberry, page 94. His treatises have touched most of the Muslim circle of the sciences. Jalaluddin Rumi's view on psychotherapy was to embrace the dread, depression and anger as a blessing. Negative emotions were a bridge to a better life. This style of coping is illustrated in his guesthouse poem: ::This being human is a guesthouse every morning a new arrival a joy, a depression, a meanness. Some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture. Still treat each guest honorably, He may be cleaning you out for some new delight! The dark thought, the shame, the malice meet them at the door laughing and invite them in, be grateful for whoever comes because each has been sent as a guide from the beyond.Rumi (1995) cited in Zokav (2001), p.47. Sigmund Freud read the German translation of the works of Hayyim ben Joseph Vital (1542–1620). Vital was a 16th-century rabbi who had been Isaac Luria's student, the great master of the theosophical Kabbalah. Freud read the French translation of the Zohar. He declared the material 'gold!' without acknowledging that source in his theories. His corpus was deeply influenced by his Jewish heritage and by the Jewish mysticism.Drob (1989); and, Drob (1998-2006). Carl Jung integrated psychology with spirituality Carl Jung read the German translations by Richard Wilhelm of The Secret of the Golden Flower, the I Ching. He also read the Kabbalah and drew on its sources for development of his theory of the archetypes.Drob (1999) Martin Buber Karen Horney studied Zen-Buddhism.For instance, Fromm et al. (1960, p. 78) states that Karen Horney \\"was intensely interested in Zen Buddhism during the last years of her life.\\" Also see DeMartino (1991). Fritz Perls studied Zen Buddhism.Wulf (1996). Typifying such a perspective, Perls once stated: We must lose our minds and come to our senses. Erich Fromm collaborated with D. T. Suzuki in a 1957 workshop on \\"Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis\\";Fromm et al.. (1960) is based on presentations given during the 1957 workshop. wrote the foreword to a 1986 anthology of Nyanaponika Thera's essays.See Nyanaponika et al (1986) Erik H. Erikson wrote a biography of Gandhi.Erikson (1969) Viktor Frankl was the founder of Logotherapy. He wrote From Death Camp to Existentialism (1959) drawing on concentration camp experience and Jewish mysticism. Abraham Maslow, an American-born Jew who struggled to make his way as a psychologist in an academic atmosphere which was not then ready to receive Jews. He believed his theories of motivation and self-actualization were, despite his avowed atheism, driven by a Jewish consciousness. The Transpersonal psychology that Maslow founded is a blend of Eastern and Western mystic traditions.See, for instance, Nielsen (1994-2001). Stanislav Grof studied pre-industrial cosmologies including Egyptian and explored the significance of the posthumous journey of the soul in works such as Books of the Dead and The Human Encounter with Death.Grof (1994a); Grof (1994b); Grof & Halifax (1977).  Influential Western writers and translators  Baruch Spinoza's legacy to psychology includes his holistic approach and determinism. He was alienated from his Jewish roots by excommunication and yet embedded in Jewish philosophy and mysticism, for example, 'The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains, which is eternal. We feel and know by experience that we are eternal'. (Book V, Proposition 23). He distinguished between active emotions (those that are rationally understood) and passive emotions (those that are not). This predated Freud's popularization of the unconscious mind. His view, that emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them, presages rational emotive therapy. His understanding of the workings of mind makes a bridge between religious mysticism and clinical psychology. Arthur Schopenhauer was deeply influenced by the first translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts to reach the west in the 19th Century. His philosophy and methods of inquiry have many similarities to those traditions. His ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's concepts of libido and unconscious mind. He added empiricism to self-examination, which presaged Freud's interpersonal application in psychoanalysis. Caroline Rhys Davids wrote on Buddhist psychology. Caroline Rhys Davids was a Pali scholar who translated original Pali texts in Buddhist Psychology. In 1914, she wrote Buddhist Psychology: An Inquiry into the Analysis and Theory of Mind in Pali Literature. Her teacher in Psychology was George Croom Robertson, Scottish philosopher, editor of Mind from foundation in 1876 until 1891. Richard Wilhelm was a translator of Chinese into German of the I Ching, Tao Te Ching and The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a foreword written by Jung, a close personal friend. Idries Shah expanded Western knowledge of Sufism Idries Shah was an author in the Naqshbandi sufist tradition who wrote works on psychology and spirituality. Defined Sufism in a way that predated Islam and did not depend on the Qur'an. Coleman Barks has translated ecstatic poems of Rumi and other mystic poets of Persia. Jack Kornfield trained as a Buddhist monk in India and Southeast Asia, holds a PhD in clinical psychology and co-founded the Insight Meditation Society and the Spirit Rock Meditation Center. His books include Seeking the Heart of Wisdom (1987, co-authored with Joseph Goldstein), A Path with Heart (1993) and The Art of Forgiveness, Lovingkindness and Peace (2002). Daniel Goleman taught psychology at Harvard, wrote on science for the New York Times and is the author of the best-selling Emotional Intelligence (1995) and Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama (Bantam Books, 2003). Thomas Cleary was a prolific translator of Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian and Muslim religious literature. First publication with his brother of the Blue Cliff Record in 1992.  Contemporary clinicians  Marsha M. Linehan incorporates mindfulness techniques (particularly Zen practices) in her Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) which has been found to be particularly effective with Cluster-B personality disorders.Regarding Linehan's conscious use of Zen techniques, see, for instance, Linehan (1993a), p. 19, and Linehan (1993b), p. 63. Jon Kabat-Zinn incorporates Buddhist mindfulness techniques in his Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. Kabat-Zinn describes the program in his book Full Catastrophe Living. Vidyamala Burch utilizes Buddhist mindfulness and metta practices in her Mindfulness-Based Pain Management (MBPM) programs, which are delivered through Breathworks. Mark Epstein is the author of Thoughts Without a ThinkerThoughts without a Thinker: Psychotherapy from a Buddhist Perspective (1995) and Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart (1998). Mordechai Rotenberg has adopted the Kabbalistic- Hasidic tzimtzum paradigm, which he believes has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's \\"self-contraction\\" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community-centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology.Rotenberg Center for Jewish Psychology  Techniques used in clinical settings  * Vipassana - trains one to perceive the momentary arising and dissipating of all phenomena, nurturing the calm, detached recognition of all things' impermanence and interdependence.

He has produced and engineered 8 albums for People Under The Stairs that have sold in excess of 100,000[] \\"Billboard Chart history for People Under The Stairs\\" units in America alone since 2000, have appeared on the US and International Billboard charts numerous times, as well as numerous remixes and singles for other artists across the globe with numerous appearances as guest vocalist. \\"Thes One's list of appearances/releases via Discogs.com\\" As a business manager, he has coordinated and managed 21+ successful world tours for People Under The Stairs and co-founded the independent artist-run Tres Records label. He also designs and builds recording studios and custom gear. His musical aliases include Lord Radio.Track Five refers to Thes One and Double K as \\"Lord Radio\\" and Halle Bop\\" \\"American Men Tracklist on Discogs.com\\" Early life Born Christopher Cesar Portugal in Torrance, California to an American mother and immigrant Peruvian father, Thes One grew up in San Pedro, California. He was first introduced to hip hop at Peck Park childcare, where older counselors would paint graffiti in the empty public pool and play the now defunct AM radio station 1580 KDAY. While attending high school in Los Angeles, Thes One met Michael Turner (Double K), and the two began working together as what would soon become People Under The Stairs. Upon graduating from Loyola High School in 1995, he applied to Berklee School of Music in Boston for a BA in Audio Engineering but received a writing scholarship to USC, where he was chosen for the prestigious honors English program. While there, he received the Seibert Fellowship for poetry, acceptance to the Golden Key Honors Society and walked in 1998 Magna Cum Laude with Dean's Honors. While studying at USC, he began recording music with Michael Turner as People Under The Stairs, and in 1997 they performed their first in-store appearance as a group at the now defunct Beat Non Stop record store on Melrose. That year they also took a trip to the Bay Area, and upon returning, wrote and recorded \\"San Francisco Knights\\", one of the group's most popular songs to date. Om years, first four albums In the spring of 1998, months before graduating and using his student loan funding, Thes One released the first People Under The Stairs 12-inch entitled The Next Step pt. 2. 250 of the original vinyl run were made until the stamper was broken, at which time an additional 200 were made from a different master without the secret bonus track \\"Live At The Fishbucket\\", which appears on first run B-side. In late summer 1998, the group independently released their first album entitled The Next Step, which he produced and engineered in its entirety. After selling out of the vinyl 12-inch in 7 minutes, the shopkeeper at the now gone Mr. Bongo's record store in London called Chris Smith, label owner of Om Records, and urged him to get in contact with the new group out of LA. Chris Smith contacted Thes One initially for one song for their compilation series Deep Concentration and Mushroom Jazz, but upon hearing the tracks they were working on, offered P.U.T.S. a four-album deal. The deal was signed in 1999 and P.U.T.S. left for their first world tour in August 1999, initially as support for the Deep Concentration project but later that year in Europe as a Solo Act with local openers. The second PUTS album, Question In The Form Of An Answer, was released in June 2000. The lead 12-inch single, \\"Youth Explosion\\", sold the full run of 15,000 copies pressed in its first month, and was not repressed in order to promote the second and third singles \\"The Cat\\" and \\"We’ll Be There\\" – each of which went on to sell its 15,000 run. The album was critically acclaimed for its eclectic and diverse range of beats rooted in jazz and Psychedelic rock and P.U.T.S. continued with another set of world tours to support the record, this time adding Japan and Australia to their routing. Following the release of the second album, Thes One began to coordinate strings of successful world tours for PUTS culminating in performances at the UK's Glastonbury Festival in 2001 alongside Kelis and shows at the Reading, Leeds and the Essentials festival in London where the group was joined with Biz Markie, Ice-T, Jeru, Masta Ace and De La Soul on the final Sunday of the festival. In between managing tours and performing, Thes One began producing and engineering the third People Under The Stairs album, which was released in June 2002 as O.S.T. (Original Soundtrack). Critically acclaimed for its broad musical influences and dead on hip hop sound, songs such as \\"Montego Slay\\" and Acid Raindrops quickly became favorites and helped solidify their dedicated worldwide fan base. As well as producing People Under The Stairs albums, Thes One completed remixes for many artists as well as library music for a few television pilots which were not picked up. 2002 also saw PUTS embark on their first national US tour as support for Deltron 3030. The group continued to tour through the 2004 release of their Or Stay Tuned album, their final release on San Francisco-based Om Records. The album was labeled an EP due to contractual issues but was considered by many, including the group, to be a full-length contribution. The group continued to tour the globe, spending, at times, 7 to 8 months of the year on the road. Tres Records In April 2004, Thes One was approached by friend Chikara Kurahashi (of Giant Panda) and was asked to co-found and help start a record label using his connections and knowledge of the record industry. He agreed, and to help get the label off of the ground, turned over a series of 12\\" projects and one album, Lifestyle Marketing, as well as the concept for the Bloquera project. The first twelve-inch release on the newly formed Tres Records imprint was Thes One's Noonen 12\\", an ode to the music of the movie Caddyshack, followed by Doin’ It with Raashan Amad. Thes One also brought artists Lightheaded (whom he signed when they opened for PUTS in Portland) and DJ Alibi to the Tres Roster. In May 2004 he coordinated the Bloquera project, a trip to southernmost Baja California to record an EP and shoot a video on Super 8. Following this trip he began executive producing and mixing the Fly School Reunion album for Tres Artists Giant Panda. Stepfather LP Thes One continued to tour with PUTS through 2005 and began production on the next PUTS album, Stepfather. He inked a deal for the group with local Los Angeles label Basement Records and coordinated the elaborate deluxe packaging with long-time friend Joshua Dunn of design team Secret Pizza Party. Stepfather (2006), PUTS fifth full-length release, was met with critical acclaim and presented a more modern and personal direction for the group. Consisting of Thes One's turn towards left of center rhythm's and modern soul and disco, it was his most ambitious production yet, though songs like Tuxedo Rap seemed, at first listen, a simple return to hip-hop's disco rap roots. The group toured the album in the US throughout that year, taking then unknown rock-rap group Gym Class Heroes as opening act with them. Stepfather debuted on the Billboard charts May 6, 2006 at #32 on the Heatseaker Chart and #35 on the Independent Albums chart.[] \\"Stepfather Billboard Chart History\\" Throughout 2006 and 2007 Thes One continued to tour as a member of People Under The Stairs and tour/business manager, expanding the groups presence throughout the world through festival dates in Japan, Australia, Europe and the US. Lifestyle Marketing LP In March 2007, Thes One released his debut solo instrumental album Lifestyle Marketing. It is a 2-disc concept album of instrumentals made from Herb Pilhofer's Music That Works series; a demonstration album originally released in the early 1970s in limited numbers that showcased Pilhofer's musical compositions for radio & TV commercials, industrial films, and other projects. The first disc is Thes One's album; the second consists of some of the original tracks from Music That Works from which Thes One's album was made. The first single off the album is the 10\\" release 'Target' b/w 'Grain Belt Beer'. Street Dreams movie In 2007 Thes One also spent the year writing, performing and recording the original 5.1 score for Street Dreams, a dramatic feature film starring Rob Dyrdek and Paul Rodriguez Jr, slated for release in 2009. His first full-length feature score, he enlisted the help of long-time friend and musical collaborator Kat 010, drummer Alex Newman, DJ Mekalek and Violinist Paul Dateh. In An interview by Berkela Motion Pictures/UX entertainment Thes One explains the process of using hip hop to score: \\"Thes One speaks on scoring Street Dreams with Rob D\\" Street Dreams was released in Theatres June 12, 2009. It received the \\"Audience Favorite\\" award at the 2009 Newport Beach Film Festival and Thes One spoke at the screening alongside director Chris Zamoscianyk and the cast of the movie. Fun DMC LP In 2008, Thes One secured a deal for People Under The Stairs with upstart label Gold Dust Media, a subdivision of K7 records worldwide. Following this, Thes One organized, planned and funded the video for \\"The Wiz\\", a song to be released on Fun DMC and shot entirely on location in Sydney Australia with director Matt Bird. Featuring innovative underwater filming and a massive helicopter shot, the video received critical and fan praise alike and helped pave the way for the successful release of Fun DMC, PUTS’ 6th full-length release. After years of producing and engineering the complicated Fun DMC album for People Under The Stairs partly in studio and partly on location in South Central Los Angeles in Blewfoot's backyard, the album received worldwide acclaim and noted a marked turn in the groups sound back towards the modern funk of early 1980s Los Angeles. Following a nationwide tour in support of the album, People Under The Stairs celebrated their 10-year anniversary in December 2008 with a sold-out show at Los Angeles’ historical El Rey theatre. On October 18, 2009 the Fun DMC debut on the Billboard charts as #6 on the Heatseekers List \\"FUN DMC Billboard Chart History\\" In February 2009, Thes One booked, managed and performed as a member of PUTS in their first tour of China, selling out shows in both Beijing and Shanghai (in excess of 800 people). PUTS, amongst other shows, was confirmed to play the Coachella Music Festival and Bonnaroo Music Festival in 2009. Immediately following their performance at Bonnaroo, Spin Magazine nominated People Under The Stairs \\"The Best...Period\\" \\"The Best and Worst of Bonnaroo, Spin Magazine June 12th 2009\\" Carried Away LP On October 13, 2009, People Under The Stairs released their 7th album, Carried Away. It marked a return to Om Records, the home of their first 4 albums and a return to a simple theme. As explained by The Onion in their AV club review \\"Carried Away proves that Thes One and Double K will be pumping out sunny, laid-back party anthems long after the Internet memes grow stale\\". \\"The Onion AV club reviews Carried Away\\" The album, which debuted at #5 on the iTunes hip hop charts was featured by iTunes, who noted: \\"As usual with PUTS, Carried Away is a self-contained effort with no guest producers or MC cameos, just entertaining rhymes and straightforward beatwork dotted with well-placed samples meant to delight hip-hop purists everywhere.\\"iTunes review of \\"Carried Away\\" Carried Away debuted on the Billboard charts at #23 on the Heatseeker Charts.[] \\"Billboard Chart History for Carried Away\\" Fans who had followed the group for years noted in many submitted reviews that the album was a return to classic PUTS material. \\"Fan Reviews of Carried Away\\" Though demand to tour the US following the release of Carried Away was strong, PUTS were determined to break new parts of the world and proceeded to tour Brazil and then the southern cape of Africa following the release of the album. \\"Live in Cape Town, Africa 2009\\" Highlighter LP Highlighter was released in late 2011 as limited CD and Double vinyl custom package. It was the first release of the newly revamped Piecelock 70 organization, which later would release a larger body of work, including releases by fellow producers Headnodic (of Crown City Rockers and The Mighty Underdogs), DJ Day and Doc Delay, and author Alan Simpson's debut novel, The Mop. Sampling Thes One began producing hip-hop beats with a modified cassette deck and a Gemini phrase sampler in a pdm-6008 in 1989. He credits the Gemini sampler for defining his loop based production style and still uses the pdm-6008 in his studio to monitor vinyl. Self-taught as an audio engineer, He would meticulously read magazines such as Home Studio Recording and the Handbook for Audio Engineering. In 1992 he began looping music on a Tascam 4-track, and after working numerous jobs, he saved up money to buy a brand new Akai MPC-3000 in 1994. Aside from an SP-1200 and a Roland VP-9000, He still uses the MPC-3000 as the primary production tool on every song, and has worked with Bruce Forat to modify the analogue side of the machine. Oftentimes defined by the jazzy sound of his earlier work, Thes One's sound and influences can largely be attributed to his massive vinyl collection. Specializing in local Los Angeles pressings of rare funk, soul and rock, he has spent the latter half of his life searching for the lost and forgotten music of his hometown. With a collection of over 10,000 pieces, he has been quoted as saying that he is not defined by his collection, but the influence in his music is undeniable. Often thickly layered with samples, one defining feature of Thes One's work is that it never sounds choppy, but rather like a reconstructed piece of music. A fan of filtering pieces of music, his work is often underlined by layers of resonant loops with sharp filter q's. His earlier work was often critically classified as derived from the golden era of New York City production, with jazzy loops and horn samples coming together to create the sonic landscape, but his later work showed more of an individual progression and closer ties to the modern soul/funk sound of Los Angeles. He has stated in interviews that he prides himself in the fact that he has tried to use different drum sounds for every beat he has made, whether released or unreleased. Equipment Starting off with cassette decks and pro-sumer equipment, his studio evolved over the years. At the point that it is featured in the book Behind The Beat,Gingko Press; illustrated edition (November 15, 2005) the photo shows an Adat-XT and an Allen & Heath GS3000 alongside his MPC-3000. This appears to be taken shortly after OST was completed. In 2004, shortly before his first feature in Remix Magazine, he acquired a Neve 5316 (Baby-V). In 2008 he commissioned Steve Firlotte of Inward Connections to build a custom console based on the API 500 series format. Thes One's original idea was to have a stripped down 500 series line input mixer, the console soon blossomed to an 86 slot 24x4x4 mixer. With Steve's design, Ian Gardeners physical design and Thes One advising and testing, the console later became the commercially available Tree Audio 500, though Thes One still owns and uses the prototype/001 serial number unit. \\"Tree Audio product page\\" Television Thes One's beats can be heard on various shows including Run's House, Rob and Big, Entourage, Girlfriends, a commercial for a Supermarket in Japan and various others.ASCAP artist placement list as of 2010 Thes One Trivia *Thes One competed on The Price Is Right under his birth name.

Plot summary  The film features Bosko working on a construction site with a goat and several small mice (all of which bear a strong resemblance to Mickey Mouse; Harman and Ising had worked with Walt Disney for several years before joining Warner Bros.). After several minutes of relatively uneventful working (marked mainly by a song and dance sequence in which one of the mice is temporarily decapitated), Bosko spots his girlfriend, Honey, working in a nearby office building. After some brief flirtation, Bosko jumps down into Honey's office, pulls out a piece of sheet music, places it in Honey's typewriter, and begins playing the typewriter like a piano (Bosko types the words \\"Don't Hold Everything\\" before launching into the song). Meanwhile, back at the construction site, the goat eats a steam-powered machine and begins to float upward. Bosko reaches out the window and begins playing the goat like a pipe organ. The goat begins to float away, and as Bosko hangs on for his life, he accidentally grabs onto a set of udders and gets sprayed with milk, distracting him enough to lose his grip and fall onto a set of bricks. Bosko inexplicably divides into six miniature Boskos and begins playing the bricks as a xylophone before he reforms to his usual self and the cartoon irises out.  Later releases  The scene with the marching mice was later re-used in the Warner cartoon It's Got Me Again!, albeit with minor changes to the animation. Many decades later, a clip of Hold Anything was shown in the 2003 TV documentary Animated Century, which showcased over 100 animated films from 26 countries.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020983/  References  External links  * * * Category:1930 films Category:1930 animated films Category:1930s American animated films Category:American films Category:1930s animated short films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

It was constructed under the German rule in 1910 by Franz Schwechten for William II, German Emperor, with significant input from William himself. Since its completion, the building has housed government offices of Germany (to 1918 and during the Second World War) and Poland (1918–1939, 1945–present). Naming The name of this structure is misleading, as the building is a palace rather than a castle. Another difference arises from the adjective imperial (cesarski) preferred by the Poles and royal (königliches) used by the Germans. The German name refers to William II as King of Prussia, in this function he built the palace as his provincial residence, while the Polish name refers to him as Emperor of Germany because the term \\"royal\\" is reserved for Poznań's Royal Castle, home to the early medieval Kings of Poland. Location The location of the castle was not accidental. After the deconstruction of the polygonal part of the Stronghold Poznań, Poznań was transformed to a residential city (Haupt- und Residenzstadt). On the new lands, Prussian authorities - who acquired the city in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 - decided to build a new Germanic urban core, known as the \\"Imperial District\\". The projects for the new district were prepared by Josef Stübben. Monumental buildings of the Imperial Districts surrounding the castle included: *Post Office building *headquarters of the Prussian Settlement Commission (now Collegium Maius) *Royal Academy (Königliche Akademie in Posen) (today Aula of the Adam Mickiewicz University, Collegium Minus and the Collegium Iuridicum) *City Theatre (today the opera house) *Academy of Music (Akademia Muzyczna w Poznaniu) *Evangelical-Augsburg Church of St. Paul (today Roman Catholic Church of the Holiest Savior) *Monument to Otto von Bismarck Architecture The castle was built in Neo-Romanesque style, considered by William to be the most \\"Germanic\\" and representing the glory of the Holy Roman Empire. The new residence was intended to reflect the control over Greater Poland by the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire The main building located in the southern part of the complex has two wings: the western -- the larger one -- consisting of apartments, and the eastern with representative rooms. On the ground floor of the western wing were rooms of the Court Marshal, Chamberlain and other members of imperial court. On the first floor were the apartments of the Emperor and his wife. A private chapel in a Byzantine style (project of August Oetken) was located in a tower. Under the chapel, on the western side of the tower was the entrance reserved for the emperor. From the entrance, stairs lead straight to the first floor. The bedrooms of the emperor and the empress were connected by a corridor with four statues of the following rulers: Margrave Gero, Emperor Otto I, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, and Duke Władysław II the Exile. The second floor was planned to be used by the crown prince (the so-called prince rooms). Most of rooms were connected by a foyer surrounding the inner yard. The most impressive room of the representative wing was the Throne Room in Byzantine style. The room was lighted by huge windows from three sides, positioned between the columns and the arches. Eight statues of Holy Roman Emperors were placed under the arches. The throne, designed in an oriental style, was situated under the middle arch. Over the windows was a gallery for guests and the orchestra. The entrance to this part of the castle was from Wałowa Street (today Kościuszki Street). The northern part of the complex, from Berlin Street (now Fredry Street), consisted of service rooms, garage, stable and coach house. Those structures and two wings of the main building surround the roses yard with a fountain, based on the Fountain of the Lions from the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra in Granada, Spain.

The total cost of the building was five million German marks, and the castle is the youngest in Europe.Document :: Facts and figures :: Multimedia City Guide William's first, and only, burgrave (Schlosshauptmann) in 1906 - 1918 was the Pomeranian noble, Count Bogdan Hutten-Czapski. After the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919), the castle became the property of the Second Polish Republic. According to a decision of the Polish government in 1921, the castle became the residence of the Naczelnik państwa and later the President of Poland. The building was also used by the Ministry of Former Prussian Partition (Ministerstwo byłej Dzielnicy Pruskiej). Some rooms were also used by the University of Poznań, Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego and other organisations. After the incorporation of Greater Poland into Nazi Germany in 1939, the authorities decided to transform the castle into Adolf Hitler's residence. It was also used by the administrator of the Wartheland, Arthur Greiser. According to this decision, Albert Speer prepared the project of the reconstruction, which completely changed the rooms of the castle. Most of the rooms were changed into the style of the Third Reich. The chapel was changed into the private cabinet of Hitler, with a characteristic balcony with an electric-heated floor. The cabinet was a copy of Hitler's room in the Reich Chancellery; the architectonic details of this room survived World War II and is often used in films. The Throne Room was also transformed into an audience hall. Under the castle, a bunker for 375 people was constructed. The rebuilding was stopped in 1943 due to the Germans' negativity from setbacks on the Eastern Front. During fighting in 1945, the castle was a temporary camp for German POWs, and was later used as a barracks by the Polish People's Army. During this period, the communist government considered the demolition of the castle as a symbol of the German occupation and bourgeois style. Due to a lack of funds, only some of the German symbols were removed and the upper part of damaged tower was demolished. During the war, the city hall and the seat of the town authorities was destroyed. The castle was renamed to \\"New City Hall\\" (Nowy Ratusz), and later transformed into a centre of culture. On 6 June 1979 the castle was declared a historical monument under protection of law. Today, the Throne Room is used as a cinema room; other apartments contain art galleries, a puppet theater, pubs, music clubs and restaurants. The courtyard is often a place of concerts and outdoor movie performances during summer. The second floor is still empty and has not been renovated. The square in front of the building is the main venue for the St. Martin's Day parade and celebrations held in Poznań annually on 11 November (see Święty Marcin).

It is performed using a drum and paddle or a pit. Its objectives are: * Removal of interfibrillary proteins. * Removal of Keratin proteins. * Collagen swelling due to the alkaline pH. * Collagen fibre bundle splitting. * Removal of natural grease and fatsS.S. Dutta, An Introduction to the Principles of Leather Manufacture, p. 160 Liming operations of cattle hides usually last 18 hours and are generally associated with the alkaline phase of beamhouse operations. Removal of interfibrillary proteins The interfibrillary proteins are denatured by the presence of alkali (particularly sodium sulfide), rendered soluble, facilitating their removal from the leather. Removal is done by the mechanical action of liming or reliming, but more prominently when the pelt is deswelled (during deliming). Failure to remove these proteins results in a hard, tinny leather (due to fibre glueing upon drying) that is brittle and inflexible. Keratin removal Keratin that is present in the hair, scales and in the epidermis of the skin is hydrolyzed in the presence of alkali (at pH values greater than 11.5). The disulfide bridges found in keratin protein are cleaved but can be reformed. Long periods of liming will result in hair removal. The main removal of keratin is performed during the unhairing operation. In traditional processing, liming and unhairing were indivisible and took place at the same time. During modern liming methods, and in particular the processing of sheepskins, the hair is removed first and then limed in a liming drum. In hair-save technology, the hides are unhaired first and then limed for a further 12–18 hours. Alkaline collagen swelling The presence of calcium hydroxide results in the alkaline swelling of skin. The result is an influx of water into the hide/skin, and a marked increase in fibre diameter and fibre shortening. The thickness of the skin increases, but the surface area of the pelt decreases. The weight increase, owing to the uptake of water, results in a doubling of the hide/skin weight. However, this weight also needs to take into consideration that proteins (especially the hair) have been removed, and the fleshing operation is often performed after liming. Collagen fibre bundle splitting The action of liming, in particular the swelling of the skin, results in the splitting of the fibre bundle sheath. Owing to the fibre diameter increasing, the bundle sheath cannot contain the thicker fibres, and it bursts open. This allows increased access to the fibres, which allows better tanning, retanning, dyeing and fatliquoring.

Born with an impressive natural voice and equipped with compelling histrionic skills, he became one of the most illustrious opera singers active in Europe and America during the late-Victorian era. Career Édouard de Reszke was born into a well-to-do and cultured family in Warsaw, where he first learned to sing. He spent four years in Italy, studying singing first with Stella and Alba in Milan and later the retired baritone Filippo Coletti. He later went to Paris to study with Giovanni Sbriglia, who was also his brother's teacher. Initially, he did not want to become an operatic performer but at the urging of his younger sister, Josephine (Józefina), he accepted an engagement with the Paris Opéra. He was chosen by the composer Giuseppe Verdi to make his debut in the first Paris performance of Aida on 22 April 1876, appearing under the composer's baton as the King of Egypt. De Reszke's older brother was the renowned lyric-dramatic tenor Jean de Reszke (1850–1925), with whom he would sing often in Paris, London and New York City during the course of the next two decades. In 1887, for example, the brothers performed together in the 500th performance of Gounod's Faust at the Paris Opéra. Josephine, Edouard and Jean's sister, also embarked on a career as an opera singer in Paris but she retired early from the stage after marrying an aristocrat while at the height of her powers. (Another sibling, Victor de Reszke, manifested more moderate talents as a vocalist.) Between the start of 1880 and the end of 1900, Édouard de Reszke appeared on more than 300 occasions at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, performing a wide range of roles in French, German and Italian operas, including works by Wagner, Verdi, Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Ponchielli, Gounod, Meyerbeer, Flotow and Mozart. He was a huge favourite, too, with audiences at New York's Metropolitan Opera during the same era. (His only serious bass rival at the Met and Covent Garden was the elegant French virtuoso Pol Plançon [1851–1914]; but the Frenchman, unlike de Reszke, barely touched Wagnerian opera.) He also sang in Chicago in 1891 and, in 1879–1881, at La Scala, Milan. In 1903, he retired from the stage after his once superlative voice developed technical difficulties and went into a swift decline. De Reszke taught singing for a while in London before returning to his estate in Poland, where he was adversely affected by the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914. Cut off from his brother by the fighting, he died on 25 May 1917 at a house in Garnek, near Częstochowa, Poland. His grave is to be found at Borowno in that country. Recordings A tall, genial man, de Reszke possessed a big, smooth, flexible and ripe-toned voice that matched his imposing physique and extroverted personality. He could sing masterfully at all dynamic levels, according to the opera critic Herman Klein, and was additionally blessed with a magnetic stage presence. During his prime, he was equally adroit at interpreting dramatic and comedic roles. Regrettably, de Reske made only three records for commercial release. These somewhat disappointing discs were recorded by the Columbia Phonograph Company in 1903. By this date, as critic Michael Scott notes in Volume One of The Record of Singing (Duckworth, London, 1977), his voice was in a severe state of deterioration caused by years of overwork and abuse, as well as the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle that had featured too much food, drink and conviviality. The best of his three Columbia discs is considered to be the Porter Song from Flotow's Martha, performed in Italian, on which he delivers a fine trill. De Reszke can also be heard singing briefly and dimly, but in seemingly more sonorous voice, on some of the crude Mapleson Cylinders that were recorded live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera at the dawn of the 20th century. All his extant recordings are available on CD re-issues.

Her Majesty's Advocate is a Scottish criminal case heard before a full bench (five judges) of the High Court of Justiciary sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal. Stuart Drury had been convicted of killing his former partner with a hammer on concluding that she had begun a new relationship with another man. The original trial judge directed the jury that a finding of culpable homicide could only be made where the accused had not intended to kill and had not displayed enough wicked recklessness to convict of murder, and that a defence of provocation was only possible if the violence was proportionate to the provocation itself. In the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgement, the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger, sought to clarify what he considered to be an incomplete standard definition of murder: This was a controversial opinion, as it made murder a more difficult charge to prove. Normally, when prosecuting, the Crown seeks to establish the appropriate actus reus, mens rea, and lack of any defences; however, Drury suggests that the mens rea of murder is \\"wicked recklessness\\", where wicked means there is no defence. This means that, if a defence exists, there is no mens rea. The effect of this is that, if the accused successfully pleads provocation or diminished responsibility, his conviction is reduced from murder to culpable homicide. This conflicts with the principle that a defence may be based on a mistaken belief by the accused (e.g. the belief he was being attacked), but that the belief must be reasonable (Owens v HMA). Drury cannot be reconciled with this idea because holding an unreasonable belief may be \\"reckless\\" but it is not \\"wicked\\". References * Drury v HMA is reported at 2001 S.C.C.R. 583.

After a claim is made, if a defence is filed each party is required to complete and return an allocation questionnaire to the court so that the judge may properly allocate the claim to a track and give further directions towards a final hearing. Forms on the Internet Sample allocation questionnaires are available on the Internet. The official UK Courts web site has many forms available, including the allocation questionnaire. The actual form is available, as of March 2007, as a pdf file. The Citizens Advice Bureau provides a generic legal advice web site with information about the words and phrases used in small claims procedure in UK Courts.AdviceGuide.org.uk from the Citizens Advice Bureau. The form itself The allocation questionnaire is a Pivotal Point in the judicial process requesting the following information: * Whether you wish to have a month to settle the case. * What is the location or venue of the case, and why it is chosen. * Whether any pre- action protocols applied, and whether these were complied with. * What is the amount of the claim in dispute. * Who you will call as lay or expert witnesses. * Whether the case should be considered small claims, or another track. * How long you think the trial will take. * How much your costs will be (in Pounds sterling). Tracks There are three tracks: # Small claims - any claim up to £10,000 and certain personal injury and tenant claims under £1,000. # Fast track - disputes involving between £10,000 and £25,000. # Multi-track - disputes that are claimed to be over £25,000, or in certain cases where the claim is for less than £25,000 but the complexity of the evidence and/or legal issues to be decided means the claim is better suited to the Multi-track, particularly where a claim will take more than 1 day to try.

He first appeared in The Adventures of Bob Hope #95 (October- November 1965), in a story written by Arnold Drake and drawn by Bob Oksner. Publication history Super-Hip appeared regularly in The Adventures of Bob Hope from issue #95 until issue #107, where he only appears in the last two panels. He does not appear in what would be the last two issues, #108 and #109, of the series. Super-Hip's sole non-Bob Hope appearance in the Silver Age was in Doom Patrol vol. 1, #104 (June 1966), as one of several super-hero guests (although the only \\"humor title\\" guest) at the wedding of Elasti-Girl and Mento. The story was scripted by Arnold Drake. In the modern era, Super- Hip makes a brief appearance in Batman: The Brave and the Bold #15 (March 2010), fighting the Mad Mod alongside Batman and Brother Power, The Geek. He appeared in Doom Patrol #20 (March 2011). According to the events of the issue (wherein he grants succor to a recently deported Doom Patrol), he is an old friend of Cliff Steele, a.k.a. Robotman. Fictional character biography Tadwallader Jutefruce (a spooneristic pun on \\"fruit juice\\") is the crew cut and bow tie-clad 'nephew' of Bob Hope and a student at Benedict Arnold High School, an educational facility whose \\"Faculty of Fear\\" is made up entirely of Universal Horror-style monsters, including principal Dr. Van Pyre, German- accented science teacher Prof. Heinrich von Wolfmann, and coach Franklin Stein. Whenever Tad loses his temper (usually at the instigation of a stupid prank by fellow students billionaire biker bully Badger Goldliver and his simple-minded stooge Doltish), the uptight mild-mannered boy genius turns green, starts to spin like a tornado and transforms into Super-Hip. The long- haired Super-Hip's outfit resembles a 1960s Carnaby Street Mod a la Austin Powers, complete with ruffled shirt, velvet jacket, and Chelsea boots with winged ankles that, similar to the Sub-Mariner, allow him to fly. He also magically acquires an electric guitar which causes whoever hears it to dance uncontrollably whenever he plays rock and roll, and he can change his form into virtually anything, limited only by his often surreal imagination. Tad has no memory of his time as the obnoxious and egotistical \\"Sultan of Swingers\\", and the only ones who know of his secret identity are his Uncle Bob and his highly educated talking dog, Harvard-Harvard.

Before the voting of the parliament, he warned that the Egyptian Army was not prepared, opining that there would be little real fighting. The battle plan was unclear and war aims were vague, making al-Mwawi uncertain of his objectives. On May 15 he led the Egyptian Expeditionary Forces into Palestine. The Egyptians numbered between 7,000 and 10,000 troops, divided into two brigades. The Egyptian Expeditionary Forces comprised the 1st Infantry Battalion (numbering 700-750), the 6th Infantry Battalion (700-750), the 9th Infantry Battalion (700-750), an armoured reconnaissance battalion (35 armoured vehicles), a light tank battalion (seven tanks), three 25 pound cannon batteries (24 cannons), one 18 pound cannon battery (eight cannons) and one six pound anti-tank cannon battery (eight cannons).http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/1998/1948/381_myth.htm With the intensification of clashes in Palestine he moved his headquarters to el-Arish where he was stationed along with an infantry force.

The municipality of Oselce consists of three villages: Oselce proper, Kotouň and Nová Ves. The total population of the municipality was 381 according to the 2001 census (225 in Oselce, 126 in Kotouň and 30 in Nová Ves). History Oselce has existed since at least 1388. In 1662, Jiří Kryštof Kokořovec is recorded as the holder of Woselecz. The first Oselce Castle was built in 1680. The Barock Palace, whose current form is due to a major remodel by Baumeister Giacomo Antonio de Maggi, was begun in 1705 and completed in 1737. Prince- Bishop, Prince Abbot Heinrich von Bibra’s nephew, Philipp Anton von Bibra (1751−1826), purchased it in 1808 from Antonin Zürchauer, who had himself purchased it a year earlier from František Dominik Janovský. By contract, it went from Philip Anton to his son-in-law, Clemens Wenzel von Boos zu Waldeck und Montfort, husband of their only surviving child, Johanna Carolina Thekla Freiin von Bibra (1774-1856). Their son, Franz Anton von Boos zu Waldeck, occupied the palace in 1832. They were also the parents of Count Ludwig Joseph von Boos-Waldeck, who promoted the settling of Texas by Germans. In 1887, Victor Boos of Waldeck inherited the property. In the 1890s, the castle Wosseletz was a place of literature and music. Victor Boos von Waldeck acted as patron and was active as an artist himself as a translator and composer. Among his most famous works is the voicing of the poem Morgens steh’ ich auf und frage by Heinrich Heine. Guests at Castle Wosseletz during this period included Jaroslav Vrchlický, Josef Vaclav Sladek, Josef Svatopluk Machar, Václav Tallich, Oskar Nedbal, Josef Suk and Adolf Hofmeister. In 1910, the land belonging to the castle had an area of 912 hectares. The castle remained in the hands of the Counts of Waldeck Boos after the Second World War, until it was expropriated by the new Communist regime in 1948. The castle now serves as an agricultural vocational school. The chapel is open to the public. The interior of the castle was modernized and the facade was renovated in the years 1990-1991.

In Colorado, the highway traverses an east–west route across the center of the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of Grand Junction and Denver via a route through the Rocky Mountains. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the Great Plains, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in Kansas and Missouri. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited on Interstate Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies where no other through route exists. The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) lists the construction of I-70 among the engineering marvels undertaken in the Interstate Highway system, and cites four major accomplishments: the section through the Dakota Hogback, Eisenhower Tunnel, Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The Eisenhower Tunnel, with a maximum elevation of and length of , is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point along the Interstate Highway System. The portion through Glenwood Canyon was completed on October 14, 1992. This was one of the final pieces of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic, and is one of the most expensive rural highways per mile built in the United States. The Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) earned the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers for the completion of I-70 through the canyon. When the Interstate Highway system was in the planning stages, the western terminus of I-70 was proposed to be at Denver. The portion west of Denver was included into the plans after lobbying by Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 is named. East of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the corridor of U.S. Highway 40, one of the original transcontinental U.S. Highways. West of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the route of U.S. Highway 6, which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s. Route description Westbound I-70 on a viaduct inside Glenwood Canyon paralleling the Colorado River and former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (now Union Pacific) main line Colorado River I-70 enters Colorado from Utah, concurrent with US 6 and US 50, on a plateau between the north rim of Ruby Canyon of the Colorado River and the south rim of the Book Cliffs. The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the Grand Valley, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area, the largest conurbation in the area regionally known as the Western Slope. The highway directly serves the communities of Fruita, Grand Junction and Palisade. Grand Junction is the largest city between Denver and Salt Lake City and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes to the north of downtown, while US 6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US 6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US 50 departs on a course toward Pueblo. I-70 exits the valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that separates the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, the first of several tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle. Glenwood Canyon East of the city of Glenwood Springs, the highway enters Glenwood Canyon. Both the federal and state departments of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon. A section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel, Hanging Lake Tunnel, Reverse Curve Tunnel, 40 bridges and viaducts, and miles of retaining walls. Through a significant portion of the canyon, the eastbound lanes extend cantilevered over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor. Along this run, the freeway hugs the north bank of the Colorado River, while the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the Denver and Rio Grande Western) occupies the south bank. The western portal of the Hanging Lake Tunnel; at this point in the canyon both the river and the railroad are directly below the freeway viaducts. To minimize the hazards along this portion, a command center staffed with emergency response vehicles and tow trucks on standby monitors cameras along the tunnels and viaducts in the canyon. Traffic signals have been placed at strategic locations to stop traffic in the event of an accident, and variable message signs equipped with radar guns will automatically warn motorists exceeding the design speed of one of the curves. The USDOT makes provision for bicycles, which are usually prohibited along Interstate Highways, along the freeway corridor in Glenwood Canyon. Rocky Mountains The highway departs the Colorado River near Dotsero, the name given to the railroad separation for the two primary mountain crossings, the original via Tennessee Pass/Royal Gorge and the newer and shorter Moffat Tunnel route. I-70 uses a separate route between the two rail corridors. From this junction I-70 follows the Eagle River toward Vail Pass, at an elevation of . In this canyon I-70 reaches the western terminus of U.S. Highway 24, which meanders through the Rockies before rejoining I-70. US 24 is known as the Highway of the Fourteeners, from the concentration of mountains exceeding along the highway corridor. Along the ascent, I-70 serves the ski resort town of Vail and the ski areas of Beaver Creek Resort, Vail Ski Resort and Copper Mountain. Entrance to the Eisenhower Tunnel The construction of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is the management of the wildlife that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross. The highway descends to Dillon Reservoir, near the town of Frisco, and begins one final ascent to the Eisenhower Tunnel, where the freeway crosses the Continental Divide. At the time of dedication, this tunnel was the highest vehicular tunnel in the world, at . As of 2010, the facility was still the highest vehicular tunnel in the United States. The Eisenhower Tunnel is noted as both the longest mountain tunnel and the highest point on the Interstate Highway System. The tunnel has a command center, staffed with 52 full-time employees, to monitor traffic, remove stranded vehicles, and maintain generators to keep the tunnel's lighting and ventilation systems running in the event of a power failure. Signals are placed at each entrance and at various points inside the tunnel to close lanes or stop traffic in an emergency. There are several active and former ski resorts in the vicinity of the tunnel, including Breckenridge Ski Resort, Keystone Resort, Arapahoe Basin, Loveland Ski Area, Berthoud Pass Ski Area and Winter Park Resort. Clear Creek The freeway follows Clear Creek down the eastern side of the Rockies, passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near Idaho Springs. Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US 6 corridor, which continues to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The interstate, however, follows the corridor of US 40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as \\"Trucks: Don't be fooled,\\" \\"Truckers, you are not down yet,\\" and \\"Are your brakes adjusted and cool?\\" Runaway truck ramps are a prominent feature along this portion of I-70, with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes. Warning sign stating, \\"Trucks, Don't be Fooled—4 more miles of steep grades and sharp curves.\\" The last geographic feature of the Rocky Mountains traversed before the highway reaches the Great Plains is the Dakota Hogback. The path through the hogback features a massive cut that exposes various layers of rock millions of years old. The site includes a nature study area for visitors. Great Plains As the freeway passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver metropolitan area, part of a larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US 40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US 6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate 76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate 25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver. Downtown Denver I-70 has one official branch in Colorado, Interstate 270, which connects the interstate with the Denver–Boulder Turnpike. Where these two freeways merge is the busiest portion of I-70 in the state, with an annual average daily traffic of 183,000 vehicles per day. While State Highway 470 and E-470 are not officially branches of I-70, they are remnants of plans for an I-470 outer beltway around Denver that were cancelled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere. Leaving Denver, the highway serves the redevelopment areas on the former site of Stapleton International Airport; runway 17R/35L crossed over the Interstate at the runway's midsection. East of Aurora, I-70 rejoins the alignment of U.S. Highway 40 at Colfax Avenue. The freeway proceeds east across the Great Plains, briefly dipping south to serve the city of Limon, which bills itself as Hub City because of the many rail and road arteries that intersect there. I-70 enters Kansas near Burlington, a small community known for having one of the oldest carousels in the United States. History As first proposed in 1944, the western terminus of I-70 was Denver, along the corridor of US 40\\\\. The portion across the Rocky Mountains was added to the plans, after lobbying by Colorado officials, following the US 6 corridor. The origins of both the US 40 and US 6 pre-date the U.S. System of numbered highways, using established transcontinental trails. Earlier routes Before the formation of the United States Numbered Highways, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the auto trail system. The surveyors of most trails chose either South Pass in Wyoming or a southern route through New Mexico to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher mountain passes in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the Lincoln Highway also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in Nebraska, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed. I-70 crossing the Rocky Mountains After losing the connection to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40. While US 6 was also one of the original 1926 U.S. Highways, the road originally served the portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. The highway was not extended to the Pacific coast until 1937, mostly following the Midland Trail. Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed, the portion of the Midland Trail through Glenwood Canyon, known as the Taylor State Road, was destroyed by a flood. When US 6 was extended, the Works Progress Administration was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the Public Works Administration was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass. In western Colorado, US 6 was routed concurrent with US 50 from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced US 24 from Grand Junction to near Vail. To keep these routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states, the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe. The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding. Interstate Highway planning Interstate 70 descending into Clear Creek Canyon Governor Edwin C. Johnson, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 was later named, was a primary force in persuading the planners of the Interstate Highway System to extend the highway across the state. He stated to the Senate subcommittee: > You are going to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You are going to > build two four-lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs > to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take > anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, > either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive > highways for the East and West to travel on. Colorado held several meetings to convince reluctant Utah officials they would benefit from a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link would be difficult to build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US 40, US 6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US 50/US 285/US 24\\\\. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US 6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas. Beavertail Mountain tunnel as seen from the Amtrak California Zephyr Congress approved the extension of I-70; however, the route still had to be approved by the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to southern California; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners approved the extension, but moved the western terminus south to Cove Fort, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with Los Angeles instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route. Construction View from Loveland Pass, showing a hairpin turn along the US 6 alignment on top right, and the straighter I-70 emerging from the Eisenhower Tunnel on the left The first Colorado portion of I-70 opened to traffic in 1961. This section bypassed and linked Idaho Springs to the junction where US 6 currently separates from I-70 west of the city. The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964. The Mousetrap reused some structures that were built in 1951, before the formation of the Interstate Highway system. The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977. =Eisenhower Tunnel= Planning on how to route the freeway over the Rocky Mountains began in the early 1960s. The US 6 corridor crosses two passes: Loveland Pass, at an elevation of and Vail Pass, at . Engineers recommended tunneling under Loveland Pass to bypass the steep grades and hairpin curves required to navigate US 6\\\\. The project was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel, after the waterway that runs along the western approach. The tunnel was later renamed the Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel, after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Colorado Governor Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. A total of nine workers were killed during the construction of both bores. Further complicating construction was that the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high altitudes, and the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, \\"We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read\\". The first bore was dedicated March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube (the Johnson bore), which was finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million; the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million today). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million today). Rest area along I-70 at the top of Vail Pass The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema was accepted for an engineering technician position in the construction of the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the Colorado Department of Transportation, citing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As Colorado voters had passed the Equal Rights Amendment that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened. =Vail Pass= While designing the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted over how to build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US 6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive \\"V\\" shape. Initially engineers thought they could shorten the route of I-70 by about by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek, an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel. This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an easement across federally protected lands, through what is now called the Eagles Nest Wilderness. After the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass. The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife, and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed offsite and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint. The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent. =Glenwood Canyon= I-70 in Glenwood Canyon as seen from the California Zephyr Glenwood Canyon has served as the primary transportation artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a dirt road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today). With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished, the last remaining obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane, non-freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966. The remainder was stopped due to environmentalist protests that caused a 30-year controversy. The original design was criticized as \\"the epitome of environmental insensitivity\\". Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts. A new design was underway by 1971, which was approved in 1975; however, environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction, and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981. The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts, three additional tunnel bores (two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s) and of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway long. The project was further complicated by the need to build the four-lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad. This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques. Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway, one elevated above the other, to minimize the footprint in the canyon. The final design was praised for its environmental sensitivity. A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed, \\"Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon.\\" He further stated, \\"I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art.\\" A portion of the project included shoring up the banks of the Colorado River to repair damage and remove flow restrictions created in the initial construction of US 6 in the 1930s. Department of Transportation drawing showing how re-using the existing footprint of US 6 combined with elevating two lanes helped minimize the environmental impact of the freeway on Glenwood Canyon The freeway was finally completed on October 14, 1992, in a ceremony covered nationwide. Most coverage celebrated the engineering achievement or noted this was the last major piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. However, newspapers in western Colorado celebrated the end of the frustrating traffic delays. For most of the final 10 years of construction, only a single lane of traffic that reversed direction every 30 minutes remained open in the canyon. One newspaper proudly proclaimed \\"You heard right. For the first time in more than 10 years, construction delays along that stretch of Interstate 70 will be non-existent.\\" The cost was $490 million (equivalent to $ million today) to build , 40 times the average cost per mile predicted by the planners of the Interstate Highway system. This figure exceeded that of Interstate 15 through the Virgin River Gorge, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the Colorado Department of Transportation, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. At the dedication it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed to be complete. However, at the time there were still two sections of the original Interstate Highway System that had not been constructed: a section of Interstate 95 in central New Jersey, that was not completed until 2018 and a section of I-70 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania. Legacy When first approved, the extension of I-70 from Denver to Cove Fort was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere; an information liaison specialist with the U.S. Department of Transportation in Baltimore, Maryland—the eastern terminus of I-70—claims people have asked \\"did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we were willing to pay $4 billion to get them there?\\" However, a resident engineer with the USDOT has called the extension one of the \\"crown jewels\\" of the Interstate Highway System. In Colorado, the freeway helped unite the state, despite the two halves being separated by the formidable Rocky Mountains. The Eisenhower Tunnel alone is credited with saving up to an hour from the drive across the state. Prior to I-70's construction, the highway through Glenwood Canyon was one of the most dangerous in the state. With the improvements, the accident rate has dropped 40% even though traffic through the canyon has substantially increased. The Colorado Department of Transportation is considering the nomination of various portions of I-70 as a National Historic Landmark, even though the freeway will not qualify as historical for several decades. I-70 through the Colorado Plateau The freeway is credited with enhancing Colorado's ski industry. The ski resort town of Vail did not exist until I-70 began construction, with developers working in close partnership with the Department of Transportation. By 1984, the I-70 corridor between Denver and Grand Junction contained the largest concentration of ski resorts in the United States. The towns and cities along the corridor have experienced significant growth, luring recreational visitors from the Denver area. As one conservationist lamented, I-70 \\"changed rural Colorado into non-rural Colorado\\". One accident at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse as no one answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking from one of the torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003. In 2014, mile marker 420 was altered by CDOT to read \\"Mile 419.99\\" following repeat thefts of the original sign due to the significance of the number 420 in cannabis culture. Future CDOT plans to rebuild the elevated section of I-70 between Brighton Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard in Denver as a below-grade highway and widen other sections between I-25 and Chambers Road in Aurora, beginning construction in 2018. The $1.2 billion project, financed through a public–private partnership with Kiewit and Meridiam, would add a new express toll lane and build frontage roads; the below-grade freeway would have a park built over the top between Clayton and Columbine streets. The project has attracted controversy from activists opposed to highway expansion, including lawsuits filed over changes to federal air quality standards that would allow the project to be built.

The railway was constructed by the Wehrmacht in occupied Norway during the Second World War as part of Festung Norwegen. At Fauske, the line connected with the Nordland Line, and construction stretched as far north as Drag, Tysfjord. After the war, the plans were abandoned by Norwegian authorities, although from the 1970s they were revitalized as part of the proposed Northern Norway Line. Some tunnels and bridges remain and part of the route has been used to build European Road E6. Route The section of the Polar Line that was under construction in addition to NSB's three 1923 proposals. Organizationally, the construction of the Polar Line started at Finneid. It ran through the Bratthaugen Tunnel before reaching Fauske, where Fauske Station was planned. At the time of German capitulation on 8 May 1945, most of the right-of-way through Fauske was completed. The line continued northwards, crossed Svartosen on a bridge and continued to the lake of Vallvatnet, where a passing loop station was planned.Ellingsve: 54 The line continued to Straumen, where a station was planned north of the village. A power station was built at Røyrvatnet. The line continued past the lake of Hellandsjøen. On the section from Hellandsjøen to Buvik, five tunnels were planned and a station at Hellbukta.Ellingsve: 56 At Megården, from Fauske, of Megården Tunnel were built. A Trengsel, from Fauske, the Trengsel Bridge was planned.Ellingsve: 57 After passing Torkildseng, from Fauske, the line was to run through two short tunnels. Stations were planned Løktehaugen and Kvarv, from Fauske, respectively. Between the two stations 18 tunnels were planned. A power station was built at Kvarv. The line was planned to run through the Espenes Tunnel before reaching the next station at Kalvik, from Fauske.Ellingsve: 59 The next station was to be at Sommerset, from Fauske, followed by a station at Lappstorvik and then reached Sørfjord.Ellingsve: 60 The next two stations were at Kobbvatnet and Gjerdalen, after which the line would have run through the Basis Tunnel and the Sildhopfjell Tunnel, the latter from Fauske. It would have then continued through the Tennvatn Tunnel,Ellingsve: 62 the Tennvatn Tunnel and the Falkelva Tunnel. Stations would have been built at Kråkmo and Sandnes, from Fauske, respectively. The line would then run through the Hellarvik Tunnel just before reaching at station at Tømmernes, from Fauske.Ellingsve: 64 At from Fauske lay the Trollpollhaugen Tunnel after which the station reached Drag, from Fauske.Ellingsve: 68 From Bjørnfjell, the line would have hugged the Norway–Sweden border into the county of Troms, before running down the Salangsdalen valley. It would pass through the villages of Setermoen and Andselv before running west of the lake of Takvatnet. It would then have reached Balsfjorden, which it would have hugged until reaching Nordkjosbotn. It would cross across Balsfjordeidet to Storfjorden, which is would follow on the east shore of. There it would have passed through the village of Skibotn and run around the Kåfjorden and through Kåfjordbotn. It would then have run along Rotsundet and reach Nordreisa,Ellingsve: 79 which would have been located form Bjørnfjell.Ellingsve: 80 The line would have continued down the valley of Reisadalen, following the river of Reisaelva for about , at which it would make a large S-bend around the lake of Ráisjávri. It would then run to from Nordreisa to Kautokeino, from where it would run north- eastwards. It would then have crossed the plateau of Finnmarksvidda and reached Karasjok, from Nordreisa. The line would then have run northwards, running along the Finland–Norway border and the Tana River until reaching Skiippagurra, from Nordreisa. From there, it would have run along the south shore of Varangerfjorden and around Kjøfjorden until reaching Kirkenes.Ellingsve: 81 History=Planning The Nordland Line, which was originally proposed to run from Trondheim to Helgeland, was first launched by Ole Tobias Olsen in 1872.Hoås and Stene: 14 By 1892, surveying on parts of the route had been started. The first specific plans for a railway north of Fauske was presented by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1901, which proposed the line be built to Røsvik with a branch to Bodø.Ellingsve: 50 The first part of the Nordland Line, the Hell–Sunnan Line, was completed in 1905.Hoås and Stene: 77 In the Railway Plan of 1923, a line between Fauske and Narvik was included and estimated to cost 160 million Norwegian krone (NOK). At the same time, the Standing Committee on Railways stated that the Nordland Line would not meet its function until it had crossed Finnmark. A report on the section from Narvik to Kvesmenes was published in March 1923, followed by the section from Kvesmenes to Alteidet in June 1926, Alteidet to Porsangerfjorden in December 1926, from Porsangerfjorden to Tana in June 1927, from Tana to Vadsø in January 1928 and from Nyborg to Kirkenes in April 1928. The distance from Fauske to Vadsø was and from Fauske to Kirkenes . Construction was estimated to NOK 375 million. NSB completed the Nordland Line to Mosjøen in 1940. Following the German occupation of Norway, construction of the line was accelerated.Svanberg: 369 On 11 December 1940, the Reichskommissariat Norwegen requested that NSB submit their plans. The plans north to Narvik were sent 21 March 1941 and the plans to Kirkenes on 20 January 1942. NSB had three different proposals for the route between Fauske and Narvik. The first—the Ferry Line—was a railway from Fauske to Korsnes on Tysfjorden and onwards to Narvik by train ferry. It would also include a ferry terminal at Tjeldsundet, where there would be a connection northwards towards Kirkenes. The second alternative—the Fjord Line—would run via Tømmerneset, Innhavet and Musken, around the southern end of Tysfjorden and then followed the shoreline to Ballangen to Narvik. The third—the Mountain Line—would follow an inland route from Kobbvatnet up Gerdalen and then through a long tunnel to Tysfjorden. The Fjord Line was longer than the Mountain Line, but considerably cheaper to build. A fourth proposal, launched by the Wehrmacht, was to build a ferry crossing of Tysfjorden, but otherwise build closely to that of the Fjord Line.Ellingsve: 70 Underpass of the Polar Line in Hamarøy in 1947 The alternatives were considered by Vienna-based Ladislaus von Rabcewicz. He considered the alternatives based on that the railway would be extended to Kirkenes, that the railway should be built as quickly as possible, and considering the line's strategic location. Of military-strategic concerns, he discarded the proposals which involved a ferry. The Fjord Line was considered advantageous gradients and close access to the fjords would allow for more work days per year. However, it had four tunnels longer than , five tunnels between , three tunnels between , five tunnels between and twelve tunnels shorter than . Rabcewicz stated that it would be necessary with immediate start of construction for all tunnels longer than , with the establishment of 24 breaking-in points.Ellingsve: 72 Rabcewicz recommended a Mountain Line, but chose to build it to intersect with the Ofoten Line at Bjørnfjell, and use that line as a branch to reach Narvik, rather than build the line directly to the town. The Mountain Line could be built faster because of shorter tunnels, the longest being , which with an estimated per day would give a construction time of 33 months. The other main advantage of the line was that it lay so far inland that an Allied attack would be improbable.Ellingsve: 74 However, Rabcewicz noted several disadvantages of the line, including steeper gradients, the lack of any fjords or residents between Kobbvatnet and Bjrnfjell and the increased amount of snow in the area. He estimated that the line could be completed by June 1945 given a work-force of 83,700 men.Ellingsve: 76 Planning of the route from Narvik to Kirkenes was led by Professor Flörke in Narvik. The first report was published on 4 July 1942, regarding the route from Kvesmenes to Skibotn. The report considered three proposals, that of NSB from the 1920s, that of the Reichskommissariat'ss railway division and that of the Flörke's group. NSB had recommended a route which followed the coastline, but Flörke stated that for military-strategic reasons this route had to be discarded. He further wanted to avoid long tunnels to decrease construction time. He also remarked that NSB's maps did not match the terrain, forcing his office to take aerial photography of the route from Nordreisa to Skippagurra between May and August 1942, while Narvik to Nordreisa was photographed between June to August. Plans consisting of the section from Setermoen to Nordreisa ( from Bjørnfjell) were sent to Einsatzgruppe Wiking in Oslo on 8 July 1942. The plans from Bjørnfjell to Setermoen were sent on 23 July.Ellingsve: 78 Construction Remains of the Polar Line at Kobbelvvågen in 1950 As part of Operation Barbarossa—the German invasion of the Soviet Union—plans were immediately dispatched to complete a railway to Kirkenes. The responsibility was given to Organisation Todt. Plans called for the Nordland Line to be completed to Rognan on 1 August 1943 and later that same year to Fauske. Construction of the section north of Fauske was, unlike the section southwards, without any Norwegian participation, including that of NSB.Ellingsve: 22 Construction was organized by Einsatzgruppe Wiking which was based in Mo i Rana and had clerks of works in Fauske and Tømmerneset. The work was performed through a number of German construction companies. Construction on the Polar Line started in January 1943. The first part of construction was for auxiliary facilities, such as barracks, quays and power supply. The workforce largely provided by Russian and Serbian prisoners of war (POW).Ellingsve: 52 Despite the enormous amount of labour construction of the railway was notoriously inefficient and the part of the railway which were completed further south was of such bad quality that most of the permanent way had to be replaced. North of Tysfjorden, the only work was a tote road between Narvik and Bjørnfjell. The area the line was being built was without road connection, and the steep terrain made it difficult to place the railway elsewhere than close by the fjords. As this was also the place where people lived, it caused a conflict of interest. According to the peace-time compulsory purchase law, the state was forced to pay due compensation for any land they needed to build public infrastructure. However, the Germans showed no interest in following these laws, took what property they needed, often without even informing the locals. In Lappstorvika, the road became so dilapidated that the locals chose to move away until after the war.Ellingsve: 69 Thirty thousand POWs were brought to work on the railway through Norland. The treatment of the POWs varied depending on their nationality, their status in regard to the Geneva Convention and their alignment.Ellingsve: 84 Russians who converted to support Andrey Vlasov were treated better and often sent to own camps. Similarly, only two of over 1,000 Polish POWs in Nordland died, and were treated better because Polish people were generally regarded as pro-Axis.Ellingsve: 88 Wehrmacht invested the equivalent of NOK 15 million in labour and other costs in the line. At the time of the German capitulation on 8 May 1945 there were an estimated 8,300 POWs living in camps on the segment between Fauske and Drag. About ten percent of those who had worked on the line had died. On 4 December 1945 the Embassy of the Soviet Union in Oslo and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs started work on a common Norwegian–Soviet commission which would investigate issues regarding Russian POWs in Norway. The commission was established in March 1946.Ellingsve: 90 Both NSB and Norwegian authorities were concerned that the Soviet goal was to claim compensation for the effective work which the POWs had done in Norway.Ellingsve: 91 Although vague estimates of the number of man-hours were calculated, no monetary value was ever determined, and no claim was submitted to the Norwegian authorities from the Soviet Union.Ellingsve: 92 Legacy Trengsel Bridge on European Road E6 was originally planned as part of the Polar Line and part of a tunnel is still visible from the road. The Nordland Line was completed to Bodø in 1962.Svanberg: 373 In the 1960s, Parliament voted to pause any further plans to build a railway northwards for ten years. Instead, the road network was to be expanded. Starting in the 1970s, a series of regional airports were built, largely undermining the need for the railway for passenger transport. In 1968, NSB again considered the Northern Norway Line, a proposal to extend the Nordland Line from Fauske via Narvik to Harstad and Tromsø. The Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that the line not be built. However, during the 1970s, income from petroleum production started a public debate as to whether the income should be used on domestic infrastructure investments.Overland: 8 In 1977, the Ribu Commission was established to look into building a new railway north of Fauske. The commission made no clear recommendation as to whether the line should be built, but stated although it had a cost of NOK 4.4 billion and would need operating subsidies, it would provide a positive economic impact on the region, particularly if additional industrial and commercial investments were made along the route.Overland: 9 Parliament did not make a decision when it debated the commission's report in 1983. Instead, a new report was issued in 1992. This time it was planned as a high-speed railway, but in 1994, the project was rejected by Parliament. When the E6 highway was built northwards from Fauske during the 1960s, parts of the right-of-way built for the Polar Line was used for the road. Specifically, the highway follows the railway route from Fauske past Vallvatnet to a point beyond Straumen, in addition to a section of the right-of-way past Torkilseng. The road also used tunnels built at Asp, Eva, Espenes, Kobbvatnet and north of Tømmerneset. 2019 study In 2019 the Norwegian Railway Directorate signed an agreement with Asplan Viak to study the development of a line from Fauske via Narvik to Tromsø. The Fauske – Tromsø Line would be around 375km long, while the Bjerkvik – Harstad line would be just over 80km long. The analyses found the full scheme development would cost NKr 113bn, while the line to Harstad would cost around NKr 20bn. The analysis showed that it would cost more than NKr 100bn ($US 11.6bn). However, the Norwegian Railway Directorate says the line will not be economically viable, as calculations show a net loss for the state of between NKr 46bn and NKr 109bn.

Life Schwechten was born in Cologne, the son of a district court judge. He attended Gymnasium, taking his Abitur in 1860, and went on to work as an apprentice of master builder Julius Carl Raschdorff, who would later design the new Berlin Cathedral. In 1861, Schwechten enrolled in the Bauakademie (Academy of Architecture) in Berlin, where he studied under Karl Bötticher and Friedrich Adler. During a practical training period following the completion of his studies in December 1863, Schwechten worked first for several months with Friedrich August Stüler, until May 1864, and then with Martin Gropius, until June 1865.Zietz, Peer (1999). Franz Heinrich Schwechten: ein Architekt zwischen Historismus und Moderne. Stuttgart: Edition Axel Menges. p. 12. In 1868, Schwechten received an award from the Berlin Architect's Union for the Neoclassical design of a Prussian Parliament building. The next year, he graduated as a master builder and began his career as chief architect of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company. His first major work was the monumental Anhalter Bahnhof terminus opened in 1880, then the largest station building in Continental Europe. Among his works were the designs of Tyszkiewicz Palace in Palanga (Polangen) and the Imperial Castle in Poznań (Posen). One of the most notable of Schwechten's designs was the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church (completed in 1895), with its tower and distinct Neo- Romanesque style elements.

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third- greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese- Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine. Several of his albums received certification of silver or gold. He received two lifetime achievement awards, one in 1993 from the BASF Awards and another posthumously in 2007 from Indonesian television station SCTV. Early life Chrisye was born Christian Rahardi in Jakarta on 16 September 1949 to Laurens Rahadi, a Chinese-Betawi entrepreneur, and Hanna Rahadi, a Chinese-Sundanese housewife. He was the second of three sons born to the couple; his brothers were Joris and Vicky. The family lived on Talang Street near Menteng, Central Jakarta, until 1954, when they moved to Pegangsaan Street (also in Menteng). While attending GIKI Elementary School, Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family; he became especially close to Bamid Gauri, with whom he played badminton and flew kites. He also began listening to his father's record collection, singing along to songs by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and Dean Martin. After graduating from elementary school, Chrisye attended Christian Middle School III Diponegoro. Beatlemania reached Indonesia while Chrisye was in Senior High School PSKD Menteng, and increased his interest in music. Responding to Chrisye's desire to play an instrument, his father bought him a guitar; Chrisye chose the bass guitar, as he considered it the easiest to master. As they could not read music, Chrisye and Joris learned to play by accompanying their father's records and songs recorded from the radio. In time they began playing at school events, with vocals by Chrisye. During this period he began smoking in school; when caught, he was punished by being forced to smoke eight cigarettes at once, in front of the assembled pupils. However, this failed to cure his habit and he eventually became a chain smoker. Career=Band member and early projects (1968–1977) Chrisye playing the bass in 1977. He sported long hair for most of his career, until his chemotherapy in 2005. In the mid-1960s, the Nasution siblings formed a band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood, Sweat & Tears. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia (UKI) to fulfill his father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, as a replacement for their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers, he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could. The group was renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they considered more macho and Western-sounding. The schedule for the band, which had no manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park. As a result, Chrisye decided to drop out of UKI; in 1970 he transferred to Trisakti Tourism Academy, where he considered the study schedule to be more flexible. In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the opportunity to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti. While in New York, Gipsy performed at the Ramayana Restaurant, which was owned by the Indonesian gas company Pertamina. The band, housed in an apartment on Fifth Avenue, performed in New York for almost a year, providing Indonesian- themed music and covering songs by Procol Harum, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Although Chrisye became upset that he could not fully express himself through covers, he continued to work. Upon returning to Indonesia at the end of 1973 Gauri and his brother Keenan introduced Chrisye to former president Sukarno's son, the songwriter Guruh Sukarnoputra. As the Nasutions worked with Guruh to prepare for their next project, Chrisye began to write his own songs; in doing so he noted that he had difficulty with lyrics that included hard consonants, and worked to avoid them. The following year, he went back to New York with another band, The Pro's. In mid-1975, with several weeks left on his contract, Chrisye's parents called from Jakarta to tell him that his brother Vicky had died of a stomach infection. Unable to return home immediately, Chrisye became distracted by thoughts of his family and began to find playing difficult. As the band returned to Indonesia, Chrisye \\"cried for the duration of the flight\\" and sank into a depression. Chrisye stopped playing altogether until the Nasutions invited him to rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs in which he would be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000 copies. The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist. In late 1976 Chrisye was approached by songwriter Jockie Soerjoprajogo and Imran Amir, head of Prambors Radio, who asked him to provide the vocals for the Prambors Radio Teenage Songwriting Competition; Chrisye refused, as he did not want to sing an Indonesian pop song. Several days later Sys NS, an employee of Prambors, approached Chrisye while he was meeting with Guruh and Eros Djarot. Sys emphasised that Prambors needed Chrisye for \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" (\\"Little Candles\\"), composed by James F. Sundah. After hearing the lyrics, Chrisye agreed. The song was recorded in Irama Mas Studio in Pluit, North Jakarta, and included on an album with the other contest winners. Originally the ninth track, \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" was placed in the lead position to increase the album's marketability after the original format sold poorly. The song then took off, receiving much airplay; the album was the best-selling of the year. After the success of \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\", in mid-1977 Pramaqua Records approached Chrisye and offered him a contract for an album, Jurang Pemisah (Dividing Canyon). Working with Jockie, Ian Antono, and Teddy Sujaya, Chrisye recorded seven songs for the album; Jockie did two more. Although he was pleased with the results and had high hopes for the album, Pramaqua decided it was not commercially viable and refused to promote it until Chrisye's subsequent album Badai Pasti Berlalu took off. After his unsuccessful attempt to buy up all the stock, the album was released, but because the general public considered it a sequel to Badai Pasti Berlalu, the sales were poor. Although the cassettes reached radio stations throughout the country, Chrisye later described the album as selling \\"as warmly as chicken shit\\". That same year, Chrisye and several artists including Djarot and Jockie recorded the soundtrack for the film Badai Pasti Berlalu over two months. After the soundtrack won a Citra Award at the 1978 Indonesian Film Festival, Irama Mas studios approached the group to do a soundtrack album for a flat fee. With Chrisye and Berlian Hutauruk on vocals, the soundtrack was rerecorded in album form in Pluit over 21 days. It was released under the same name as the film, with a picture of actress Christine Hakim on the cover. The album included Chrisye's first songwriting credit, \\"Merepih Alam\\" (\\"Fragile Nature\\"), but sales were stagnant for the first week until radio stations began to play the singles. Early solo and film career (1978–1982) Chrisye's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy. Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, Sabda Alam (Nature's Order), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies. The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona (Stain of Enchantment) with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. Percik Pesona, released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu. As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May. After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, Puspa Indah (Beautiful Flower). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language \\"To My Friends on Legian Beach\\". Two of the songs, \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" (\\"Galih and Ratna\\") and \\"Gita Cinta\\" (\\"Love Song\\"), were used in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA (Love Song from High School); Chrisye played a minor part in the film's sequel, Puspa Indah Taman Hati (Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden), as a singer. Due in part to the popularity of the film, Puspa Indah was well received and sold well; \\"Galih dan Ratna\\" and \\"Gita Cinta\\", released as singles, were also commercially successful. In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan (As Beautiful as the Moon); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released Pantulan Cita (Reflection of Dreams), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long sabbatical. Marriage and changing styles (1982–1993) Although popular with groupies, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry, was a former singer and came from a musically inclined family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye while he waited for Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang-style wedding. Driven by his poor financial position and invigorated by Djarot's return from Germany, Chrisye began work on his next album with Djarot and Jockie in early 1983. Aciu Widjaja, the new manager of Musica, speculated that they required a new sound; as such, Chrisye, Djarot, and Jockie mixed art rock with Chrisye's standard romantic pop and drew influences from The Police. The resulting album, Resesi (Recession), was released in January 1983. The album was well received, selling 350,000 copies and being certified silver; the singles \\"Lenny\\", \\"Hening\\" (\\"Silent\\"), and \\"Malam Pertama\\" (\\"Wedding Night\\") received much airplay. In February 1983, he released another jazzy single titled Kisah Insani in collaboration with Vina Panduwinata. After Resesi, Chrisye collaborated with Djarot and Jockie on the 1983 album Metropolitan. The album, drawing on new wave influences and dealing mainly with issues facing youth, was well received, later going silver; the single \\"Selamat Jalan Kekasih\\" (\\"Goodbye Dear\\") also became a hit. That year, Chrisye and Yanti had their first daughter, Rizkia Nurannisa. In November 1983, Chrisye released another hit single titled Seni (Art) from the compilation album Cinta Indonesia. The following year, Chrisye, Djarot, and Jockie collaborated again on Nona (Miss), which featured social criticism; the album spawned four singles and went on to be certified platinum. Despite Nona warm sales, after some influence from Aciu, Chrisye decided to look for a new sound and broke off his partnership with Djarot and Jockie in mid-1984. Chrisye approached Addie MS, a young composer, and asked him to help with the next album. Addie, despite feeling that he was not in the same class as Djarot and Jockie, accepted, and suggested using similar melodies as in \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" and Badai Pasti Berlalu. The resulting album, Sendiri (Alone), with songs by Guruh and Junaidi Salat, included harps, oboes, cor anglais, and a string section. Spawning three singles, the album sold well and earned Chrisye his first BASF Award. In late 1984 Chrisye approached another young composer, Adjie Soetama, to help him prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled Aku Cinta Dia (I Love Her), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided that it would be the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye – known as having a stiff stage persona – struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura (Hip Hip Hurray!), and another collaboration, Nona Lisa (Miss Lisa), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia. On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa. Despite the success of the trilogy, Chrisye and his family continued to struggle financially; twice they had to sell their family car to raise cash. This led Chrisye to briefly consider quitting the music industry. In 1988 Chrisye recorded Jumpa Pertama (First Meeting), and the following year he released Pergilah Kasih (Go Away Dear). He later recalled that the album, with an arrangement by Younky Suwarno, had a \\"beautiful touch\\". The title song, \\"Pergilah Kasih\\", was written by Tito Sumarsono and used to make Chrisye's first music video; the video, directed by Jay Subyakto, was the first Indonesian song to be shown on MTV Southeast Asia. On 27 February of the following year, Chrisye and Yanti had twin sons, Randa Pramasha and Rayinda Prashatya. In 1992 Chrisye recorded a cover single of Koes Plus' song \\"Cintamu T'lah Berlalu\\" (\\"Your Love has Passed\\") with arrangement by Younky; the music video was again broadcast on MTV Southeast Asia and became the first Indonesian music video to be broadcast on the American version of MTV. The following year, Chrisye paired up with Younky again to record Sendiri Lagi (Alone Again), a project which required four months of planning and another four months of recording; the music video for the title song was also circulated on MTV South-East Asia. Concerts and collaborations with Erwin Gutawa (1994–2004) After the success of the Sendiri concert, Chrisye collaborated several times with Erwin Gutawa (pictured in 2004). Although Sendiri Lagi did fairly well, in the beginning of the 1990s Chrisye began to feel pressure from the increasingly visual-oriented music industry and growing amount of young talent. He again began considering leaving the music industry, feeling as if he had already \\"reached the finish line\\". Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties, Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers. While in this state of despair, Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution, who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the Jakarta Convention Centre, which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist. Unconvinced he had sufficient fans to fill the hall, Chrisye initially refused. Gauri tried for several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and following Chrisye's introduction to Erwin Gutawa, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him that it might be the last chance to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week. The concert, entitled Sendiri to demonstrate that \\"100% Indonesian\\" concerts could be successful, was held on 19 August 1994. Chrisye performed a set that included his greatest hits and several duets, among them \\"Malam Pertama\\" with Ruth Sahanaya, in front of a full orchestra conducted by Gutawa. Chrisye recalled later that the audience – children and adults – had memorised the lyrics to his songs, classics and recent releases; he said that this gesture made him feel incredibly small. Invigorated by the concert's success, Chrisye went on tour to Surabaya, Surakarta, and Bandung, using a convoy of 24 trucks and buses to transport the necessary equipment; those concerts also sold out. Following the success of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the possibility of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney. AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well. After AkustiChrisye, Gutawa suggested that Chrisye try a new style, with more serious songs. The two soon began collaborating on Kala Cinta Menggoda, again using an Australian orchestra. Chrisye, however, found himself unable to record one of the songs, \\"Ketika Tangan dan Kaki Berkata\\" (\\"When Hands and Feet Speak\\"), written by poet Taufiq Ismail and based on verse 65 of the Qu'ranic sura Ya Sin; he would break into tears after singing only a couple of verses. Eventually, the day before he was to leave for Australia, he completed the song with Yanti's support. On 11 October Chrisye performed \\"Indonesia Perkasa\\" (\\"Powerful Indonesia\\") at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Southeast Asian Games; the song was written for the event. The following month he released Kala Cinta Menggoda. The music video for the titular song, directed by Dimas Djayadiningrat, won the MTV Video Music Award for South-East Asia on 10 September 1998; Chrisye went to Los Angeles to accept the award at the Universal Amphitheatre. Chrisye began work on a rearrangement of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 at the request of Musica Studios – although he felt that the original album was fine – and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu, cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told Kompas that he felt as if he had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing \\"Indonesia Perkasa\\" at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in Sidoarjo, East Java. In 2001 Chrisye released the studio album Konser Tur 2001 (Concert Tour 2001), which included two new songs and several old ones. The music video for one of the new songs, \\"Setia\\" (\\"Loyal\\"), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing. Soon afterwards, Chrisye decided to cover some of what he considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country's independence in 1945, ranging from songs from the 1940s like Ismail Marzuki's \\"Kr. Pasar Gambir & Stambul Anak Jampang\\" (\\"Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the Cowlicked Child\\"), to the late 1990s such as Ahmad Dhani's \\"Kangen\\" (\\"Longing\\"). It also featured a song written exclusively for the album by Pongky of Jikustik and two duets with Sophia Latjuba. The album, Dekade (Decade), was released in 2002; by October 2003 it had sold 350,000 copies. On 15 December 2002 Chrisye participated in the Bali for the World – Voices of Stars concert at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise funds for the victims of the bombings on 12 October; other acts involved included Melly Goeslaw, Gigi, Slank, and Superman is Dead. On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third concert, Dekade, at Plenary Hall. The concert, with a set that contained numerous classics included in Dekade, featured duets with Sophia Latjuba and several of the original performers, such as Fariz RM with \\"Sakura\\" and A. Rafiq with \\"Pengalaman Pertama\\" (\\"First Experience\\"); Gutawa's orchestra again provided the music. Chrisye then began work on his last studio album, Senyawa (One Soul). In collaboration with other Indonesian artists including Project Pop, Ungu, and Peterpan, he also produced the album, replacing Gutawa. The song \\"Bur-Kat\\" (\\"Say It Quickly\\"), with Project Pop, marked his first attempt at rap. Released in November 2004, the album was well received by the market, but Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia complained that the names of their artists were featured on the cover. As a result, the album was withdrawn, and re-released without the offending names. Illness and death Chrisye's grave in Jeruk Purut Cemetery In July 2005 Chrisye was admitted to Pondok Indah Hospital, complaining of breathing difficulties. After 13 days of treatment he was moved to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although concerned about losing his hair, which he considered part of his image, he underwent the first of six rounds of chemotherapy on 2 August 2005. Chrisye's health improved in 2006 and in May and November he undertook long interview sessions with his biographer Alberthiene Endah. He also released two compilation albums, Chrisye by Request and Chrisye Duets; however, he reportedly did not feel well enough to release new songs. By February 2007 his health was again in decline. Chrisye died on 30 March 2007 at his home in Cipete, South Jakarta. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Public Cemetery, South Jakarta. His funeral was attended by hundreds, including Indonesian celebrities such as his collaborator Erwin Gutawa and singers Titiek Puspa, Ahmad Albar, Sophia Latjuba, and Ikang Fawzi. One hundred days after Chrisye's death Musica released two compilation albums. Entitled Chrisye in Memoriam – Greatest Hits and Chrisye in Memoriam – Everlasting Hits, they contained fourteen hits from albums ranging from Sabda Alam to Senyawa. On 1 August 2008 Chrisye's last single \\"Lirih\\" (\\"Gentle Voice\\"), written by Aryono Huboyo Djati, was released. The song's existence had been kept secret, and the recording date is unknown; Djati has said that it was recorded \\"for fun\\". A music video directed by Vicky Sianipar and featuring Ariel Peterpan, Giring from Nidji, and Chrisye's widow was released later. Style According to Jockie, one of the main reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" was that he had a unique voice with a soft timbre, which went well with the keyboards used; Jockie, however, felt that Chrisye's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music, which led him to give their collaboration Jurang Pemisah more of a rock feel. Gutawa compared Chrisye's voice to a blank sheet of paper, able to be applied to anything. Sys NS wrote in 2007 that he had been looking for \\"someone with the voice of an angel\\" to sing \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\", and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly. A writer for the Indonesian magazine Gatra described Chrisye's on-stage persona as \\"stiff\\", with very little movement. Alex Hasyim, who did the choreography for Aku Cinta Dia and Hip Hip Hura, recalled that Chrisye was in a cold sweat on their first day of practise and eventually created his own dancing style as he could not follow Hasyim's instructions. Chrisye chose his own costumes and at times experimented with different colours and designs. In all his music videos he preferred to wear the same style of shirt, quipping in an interview with Kompas that he would only wear a different one if he had fallen into a ditch. Legacy Glenn Fredly (left) performing a tribute to Chrisye at the 2009 Java Jazz Festival in Jakarta Chrisye has been described as \\"legendary\\" by several journalists. In their 2007 list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time, Rolling Stone Indonesia ranked Badai Pasti Berlalu first. Three of Chrisye's solo albums were also on the list: Sabda Alam at 51, Puspa Indah at 57, and Resesi at 82. Guruh Gipsy was selected as the second-best album of all time. This was followed by the selection of four of his songs (\\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" at number 13, \\"Merpati Putih\\" at number 43, \\"Anak Jalanan\\" at number 72, and \\"Merepih Alam\\" at number 90) as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time; Guruh Gipsy's song \\"Indonesia Maharddhika\\" placed at number 59. In 2011 they listed Chrisye as the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Eros Djarot described him as having a great voice, but somewhat shy and generally unwilling to discuss social issues. According to data from the Indonesian Recording Industry Association, the original Badai Pasti Berlalu is the second-best-selling Indonesian album of all time, with nine million copies sold between 1977 and 1993. In 1990 the music video for \\"Pergilah Kasih\\" was the first Indonesian music video to be shown on MTV Hong Kong; the video clip for \\"Sendiri Lagi\\" was voted the best Indonesian music video of all time in the fifth episode of Video Musik Indonesia. In 2009 many Indonesian artists, including Vina Panduwinata, Ahmad Albar, D'Cinnamons, and Sherina Munaf, performed 20 of Chrisye's songs as a tribute in the \\"Chrisye: A Night to Remember\\" concert at the Ritz Carlton, Jakarta. The sold-out concert also featured testimonials by his wife and children. Another concert, described as Chrisye's fourth, rather than as a tribute concert, was held on 5 April 2012. Entitled Kidung Abadi Chrisye (Chrisye's Eternal Ballad) and held at Plenary Hall in the Jakarta Convention Centre, it featured a holographic representation of the singer performing with Sophia Latjuba, Once Mekel, Vina Panduwinata, and Gutawa's daughter Gita. The concert included a new song, \\"Kidung Abadi\\" (\\"Eternal Ballad\\"), written by Erwin and Gita Gutawa and made using 246 previously recorded syllables. Alberthiene Endah has written two biographies of Chrisye. The first, Chrisye: Sebuah Memoar Musikal (Chrisye: a Musical Memoir), was published in 2007 and details his childhood, career, and struggle with cancer. The second, The Last Words of Chrisye, was released in 2010 and covers the final years of his life. Another book, Chrisye, di Mata Media, Sahabat & Fans (Chrisye, in the Eyes of the Media, Friends, & Fans) was released in March 2012. In 2017, a biopic film depicting on his life journey was scheduled to be released in September, directed by Rizal Mantovani and starring Vino G. Bastian as Chrisye. Filming began in February 2017. On 16 September 2019, Google celebrated his 70th birthday with a Google Doodle. By the end of September 2020 Musica Studios released his previously unreleased single, Rindu Ini, which was recorded in September 1995. Honours and awards Chrisye received numerous awards during his career. In 1979 he was selected as the Favourite Singer of the Indonesian Armed Forces. His albums Sabda Alam and Aku Cinta Dia were certified gold, and the albums Hip Hip Hura, Resesi, Metropolitan, and Sendiri were certified silver. Chrisye received three BASF Awards, sponsored by the BASF cassette production company, for best-selling albums; his first was in 1984 for Sendiri, followed by one in 1988 for Jumpa Pertama and one in 1989 for Pergilah Kasih. He received the BASF Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994 for his contributions to Indonesian music; the same year he received the BASF Award for Best Recording Artist. In 1997 he received an Anugerah Musik Indonesia for Best Male Pop Singer. The following year Kala Cinta Menggoda won nine AMIs, including Best Album; Chrisye himself received awards for Best Male Pop Singer, Best Recording Singer, and Best Graphic Designer (shared with Gauri). In 2007 he posthumously received the first SCTV Lifetime Achievement Award, which was accepted by his daughter Risty. Personal life Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of Air Asia, described Chrisye as a simple man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye was the only one who did not look for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano. After his marriage to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little time to spend with them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family. Discography Chrisye released 31 albums during his lifetime, 1 with Guruh Gipsy, 21 studio albums, and 9 compilation albums. His solo albums after Sabda Alam all sold more than 100,000 copies. In a 1992 interview with Kompas, Chrisye said that he fell ill after recording each of his albums, blaming the pressure to promote them. Chrisye also released many singles, several of which were used as theme songs for Indonesian soap operas: \\"Pengalaman Pertama\\" was used for the serial Ganteng-Ganteng Kok Monyet (Very Handsome, But Like a Monkey!), \\"Cintaku\\" (\\"My Love\\") from the remastered Badai Pasti Berlalu was used for Gadis Penakluk (The Maiden Conqueror), and \\"Seperti Yang Kau Minta\\" was used for Disaksikan Bulan (Witnessed by the Moon).

The horn section were composed of Don Myrick on saxophone, Louis \\"Lui Lui\\" Satterfield on trombone, Rahmlee Michael Davis on trumpet, and Michael Harris on trumpet. The Phenix Horns are also known for their work with Phil Collins and his band Genesis. As well they've performed with other artists such as The Chi-Lites, Ramsey Lewis, Deniece Williams and The Emotions. History=The Pharaohs Don Myrick, Louis Satterfield, and Ramlee Michael Davis recorded in the early 1970s with the formation the Pharaohs, from which two albums have been re-issued on CD: The Awakening, recorded in 1971, and a live album, In the Basement, recorded in 1972. Formation A young drummer by the name of Maurice White met trombonist and bassist Louis Satterfield while performing at Chicago's Chess Studios. At that time Satterfield was working at Chess as a musician, where he played on hit songs such as Fontella Bass's Rescue Me. The duo later collaborated as part of a jazz group known as The Pharaohs. After leaving Chess to play in the Ramsey Lewis Trio, Maurice went on to start up a band known as Earth, Wind & Fire. He eventually expanded the band's sound to include a horn section called The Phenix Horns. Two of Satterfield's bandmates from The Pharaohs, Saxophonist Don Myrick and Rhamlee Michael Davis, joined the horn section, along with trumpeter Michael Harris. It was Harris's unique control and precision in the instrument's upper register that helped define the section's sound. The group was less beholden to middle register three and four-part harmonies (the trademark of Chicago's Lee Loughnane, Walter Parazaider, and Jimmy Pankow), instead favoring a more staccato, rhythmic, borderline percussive approach similar to the sound being popularized by trumpeter/arranger Greg Adams in Tower Of Power (though notably excluding the contrapuntal baritone saxophone spits favored by Adams, obviously in deference to the three horn, sax-centric sound of James Brown). This sound was ideally suited for Maurice's increasingly dance-oriented songs. 1974's \\"Mighty Mighty\\" from Open Our Eyes provides an early example (as well as a rare glimpse of Andrew Woolfolk's considerable facility on the soprano saxophone, an instrument noted for being inherently difficult to play in tune). The culmination of this sound, however, is best exemplified by 1978's \\"September\\", which prominently features a fast-moving unison line played in three octaves (Satterfield in the lower octave, Myrick and Davis doubling in the middle octave, and Harris in the upper octave) - for Satterfield and Harris, the line is in a difficult part of their respective instruments' upper registers, and the extreme precision is a testimony to both players' virtuosity. The section also developed a unique approach to ballads. Davis and Harris doubled on the fluegelhorn, an instrument with roughly the same range as the trumpet but with a considerably softer, warmer timbre (the flugel was a favorite texture of many jazz trumpeters, notably Clark Terry, Art Farmer and Freddie Hubbard). The softer palette created by the blend of the two fluegels with Myrick's tenor sax and Satterfield's trombone allowed the section to still play interesting countermelodies and staccato jabs (listen to the post-chorus instrumental breaks of Reasons for a prime example) without being obtrusive or overbearing. Myrick was also developing a distinctive solo voice. Though Laws and later Andrew Woolfolk, Laws's replacement, were intended to play the featured instrumentalist role in the band's live shows, Myrick eventually won over some of those duties for himself. He was particularly adept on the alto saxophone, distinctly demonstrating the influence of soul-influenced bebop saxophonist Julian 'Cannonball' Adderley. His tour de force is the burning, passionate solo on the 1979 single \\"After The Love Has Gone\\". 1979 saw the arrival and almost immediate departure of trumpeter Elmer Brown; who you can hear playing lead trumpet in Rotherdam,The Netherlands and Budokan, Japan live concerts in 1979. Collaboration with Phil Collins In 1981, the foursome joined Genesis drummer Phil Collins and producer Hugh Padgham in the studio for the recording of Collins's debut solo album, Face Value. Five of the musically diverse album's 12 tracks featured horns, with a sixth (a rendition of the Beatles's Tomorrow Never Knows) featuring electronically manipulated samples of the section. The group's (and in particular Harris's) extreme precision was put to good use in up-tempo numbers like \\"Behind the Lines\\" and the mostly instrumental \\"Hand In Hand\\". Myrick's lyrical alto playing is featured prominently on \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\", as are Harris's and Davis's signature fluegelhorn lines. The section also joined Collins's band Genesis at Fisher Lane Farm Studios, in Surrey, England,Jisi, Chris. \\"Transcription: \\"No Reply at All\\" by Genesis - Mike Ruth Line.\\" 19.10 (2008): 78-80. Web. on the song \\"No Reply at All\\" on their album Abacab, as well as on \\"Paperlate\\", a song from the band's EP 3×3 which was also included on the U.S. release of the album Three Sides Live. The foursome developed a strong kinship with Collins and elected to join him on tour and for the recording of subsequent albums, while still intermittently performing and recording with Earth, Wind & Fire. 1982's Hello, I Must Be Going! saw a feature instrumental piece, \\"The West Side,\\" penned for Myrick by Collins. Early concert footage shows the section doing considerably more than playing their instruments. Prior to 1989 Collins did not use dedicated backing vocalists in his live band, relying instead on instrumentalists. While guitarist Daryl Stuermer and bassists Mo Foster and Leland Sklar sing sporadically, the horn section sings and plays percussion on virtually every song that does not feature horns. During the extended intro to \\"Hand In Hand\\", the foursome join Collins at the front of the stage for a vocal call and response. Harris also contributed a brief co-lead vocal on the closing number, a rendition of the Isley Brothers's \\"It's Alright\\". Additionally, Satterfield played baritone saxophone to brighten the section's sound for certain parts. Following the 1985–86 tour, Michael Harris departed the group and was replaced by Harry Kim. The horn section saw a diminished role in the live show. Collins began employing backing vocalists and occasionally dedicated percussionists. Following the 1990 live album/video Serious Hits… Live! Don Myrick also departed, largely due to continued struggles with drug addiction. Myrick was shot to death by a Santa Monica Police Department officer in the doorway of his home in 1993. He was replaced by erstwhile EWF co-saxophonist Andrew Woolfolk. By the time of the recording of 1996's Dance into the Light, the Phenix Horns had dissolved. They were replaced by the Vine Street Horns, featuring Phenix Horns replacements Woolfolk and Harry Kim along with 2nd trumpet Daniel Fornero and trombonist Arturo Velasco. In 2000, Collins sued two members of the Phenix Horns, Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis, to recover overpayment of royalties over 6.5 years. Due to an accounting error, Satterfield and Rahmlee had been paid a 0.5% royalty for their contributions to the Serious Hits... Live! album while Collins' management contended that the pair should have been paid only for their contributions on 5 tracks of the 15-track album. The court ruled in favor of Collins but awarded only half of the $384,000 he sought. Satterfield and Rahmlee were not required to pay back any money already paid out, and the $192,000 damages were to be paid from future royalties. Breakup of the group Band leader Don Myrick was killed by police in 1994.\\"Saxophonist Donald Myrick fatally shot in drug probe\\", Jet, 23 August 1997 Louis Satterfield died in September 2004. Rahmlee Michael Davis ultimately resumed a career as a solo jazz artist and occasional sideman/session player. Louis Satterfield returned to performing until his death in 2004. Don Myrick is buried in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood/Los Angeles, across the street from The Forum, former home of the LA Lakers. Kim and Woolfolk still do session work with Fornero and Velasco under the Vine Street Horns moniker. Ronnie Laws performs primarily as a solo jazz artist. Michael Harris has been recently touring with The Al McKay All Stars, performing classic Earth, Wind & Fire hits.

It is primarily used as a first name, but also occurs as a surname. It is particularly frequent in Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Flanders and Scandinavia. It is also the most common name in Lithuania, however, in Lithuania, the name Jonas is derived from the Hebrew Yohanan as opposed to Jonah. Its widespread use and popularity has roots in its Jewish and Christian origins. As a surname, it is often Jewish, whilst as a first name it is mostly used in countries where Christianity is the main religion, especially in Scandinavian countries and Germany. In Turkish, Arabic, Persian and the Muslim world the equivalent name is Yunus (یونس) or Younes. In North America the name found popularity among Métis and Aboriginals in the Northwest.  Greek etymology  Jonas possibly originates from the Greek word Ίωνας (Ionas), a member of the Greek tribe (Ιωνες) Iones or Ionians, who colonized western Asia. It is the Greek transliteration of \\"Jonah\\" (as in the Old Testament Book of Jonah). Meaning The Hebrew version of the name means Dove; That is because the word 'Jonas' comes from the Greek word οιωνός (pronounced: e-oh-nos), meaning sign or portent, because in ancient Greece it was believed that birds were sent by gods as a sign to people. From this it is assumed that the name Jonas means a peaceful being. As a variation of Jonah, it can be considered to mean 'accomplishing', and a 'gift from God'.

Much of what is known about it comes from the structures that are still standing. These structures have e Aztec empire. In so doing, instead of demolishing an old temple and building a new one at the same site, they simply built over the old structure. Some temples have been found to have at least four or five layers. Houses were uniform throughout most of the empire, only varying in size and ornamentation. Houses were built with logs and were not separated, thus resulting in one large room. Aztec architectural sites include, Malinalco, Tenayuca (conquered by the Aztec circa 1434; the earliest known example of the typical Aztec double pyramid, which consists of joined pyramidal bases supporting two temples), and the Templo Mayor, the biggest building in the Aztec city Tenochtitlan.  Architectural styles  The Aztec civilization originated in Central America. Likewise, the architecture of the ancient Aztec architecture reflects that of the natives' traditions, culture, religion, and everyday life. The ancient Aztecs relied on cosmology, astronomy, and religion as their main sources of inspiration. The most prominent of features are the Aztec temples which were built for the purpose of appeasing the gods, so many of their features reflect that goal. The temples were terraced pyramids with steep stairs leading up to the main temple.  Symbolism  Eagle – representative of the sun and warriors Serpents – represented water or fire Conch shell – an important symbol of fertility Frogs and sea creatures – represented Tlaloc Symbols  Structural and engineering technologies  As seen in prior sections, the Aztecs had advanced knowledge of building techniques. J. A. Joyce, a journalist for The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, states that \\"The physical geography of Central America was favorable to the rise of the art of building in stone\\" (159). Aztecs, with only primitive technologies, were very skilled with stone and masonry to construct these massive temples. With that, the Aztecs also had knowledge of brick and mortar. With this very strong combination, they built the massive structures that have withstood the test of time. At the same time, with the high level of stone masonry, the Aztecs also knew how to properly build on the local geology and terrain. The area that this civilization is located in has a warm climate. The soil is soft and is prone to subsidence. The Aztecs realized this and built strong stone bases for the temples, similar to how a building or house has a foundation layer in modern time. These foundations made sure that the large structures on top of them would not crumble back into the earth. The temples were not the only major works of engineering the Aztecs constructed. On top of the importance of the temples and their symbolism, the Aztecs also had a bustling civilization to take care of. They had advanced knowledge of agriculture and city planning. The ancient Aztecs used gravity to make a running water system, bringing fresh water to the city grid. They also employed terracing to enhance agricultural productivity.  Relationship with Aztec culture  From the artworks, temples, cultural contributions, and even the common household, the architectural style of the Aztecs always represented a higher power. This had aspects of human sacrifice. With that, the Aztecs designed their buildings to be functional for everyday life, as well as their religious practices. The temples were designed as an ascending experience. There were multiple torn levels, all different in classes. At the top was the main temple. The idea of ascension was to prepare oneself so that the gods would be pleased when arriving at the top. At the top was where the sacrifices took place, so the Aztecs could be as close to the gods as possible to please them. As for the households, they were simpler yet uniform to the rest of the civilization. The Aztecs did not want a mismatched civilization. This could displease the gods in the eyes of the Aztecs. Houses could be one to two stories tall and were for all classes. Priests were the only ones with access to the temples.  Tradition  As is already known, the Aztecs had rich traditions. They expressed it not only through their architecture, but their art as well. Sculptures and depictions of traditions, gods, local creatures, and much more decorated the streets and building sides. Much of this artwork is local to northern and central Mexico. The influence of this art can be seen as far as Utah in the United States. This shows the influence of the Aztecs at the time. These artworks are primarily preserved in museums at this point, but some still exist on site.  Separation of classes  One of the staples of all civilization is the separation of classes. As most civilizations do today, the Aztecs held this concept throughout their culture. As previously stated, the highest rank one could get in the Aztec social class was that of the priesthood. This gave access to the temples and richer quarters of the civilizations. These individuals lived around the temples while lower classes lived increasingly further away according to their status. The first circle was first class. The Second, middle class. The Third, lower class. Jan Marie Olson, a writer of Cambridge University Press, states that \\"this line of Aztec class analysis posits major differences in wealth, power and status leading to significant lifestyle differences between nobles and commoners\\" (133). The rich and the poor lived among each other, as religion brought the civilization together, but each class had different roles.

The tallest mountain in the range is Quartz Mountain at above sea level. The area is popular for rockclimbing on its weathered granite outcroppings and is home to Quartz Mountain State Park and Lake Altus-Lugert reservoir. History Formerly controlled (at least nominally) by Spain, France, Mexico, and the Republic of Texas, In the mid 19th Century, these mountains were part of the United States area known as the Leased District and Indian Territory. Old Greer County and the Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation were created from this district and became part of Oklahoma Territory. Actually, the area was mostly controlled by nomadic Native American tribes, until they were militarily pushed onto reservations. Intensive hunting exterminated many species of the region's fauna (e.g., bison, elk, wolves and mountain lions) before the 20th Century. General Philip Sheridan reportedly said, \\"...[hunters] have done more in the last two years, and will do more in the next year, to settle the vexed Indian question than the entire regular army has done in the last thirty years.\\" Finally, after personal pleas from the Comanche chief, Quanah Parker, President Theodore Roosevelt authorized a policy of repopulating the area with the original species. Protected areas In 1927, Lake Altus (now Lake Altus- Lugert) was created at the base of the Quartz Mountains. In 1935, a tract adjoining the lake was declared Quartz Mountain State Park.

He was born in Antwerp, Belgium, on 2 August 1899, and was educated in the United Kingdom.Horn (1980), p. 56 He served as a translator for the Belgium Army, attached to the British Expeditionary Force during the First World War. He attended Cambridge University's Emmanuel College, where he received his Master's degree in 1925.Podlecki (1994), pp. 236-238 He moved to Canada in 1928, to begin his career as a professor of classics at the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto (UofT). He became the head of the classics department in 1931. Grube was a socialist, and serving in World War I turned him into a passionate pacifist. During his tenure at the UofT, he was involved in the Toronto branch of the League for Social Reconstruction (LSR), serving as president from 1934-1935. When the LSR took control of the nearly bankrupt magazine, Canadian Forum, Grube became its editor from 1937 to 1941. It was during his tenure at the magazine that it became the main media outlet for the LSR's publications.Horn (1980), pp. 14, 202 From 1944 to 1946, Grube was the President of the Ontario Co-operative Commonwealth Federation's (CCF) executive, often acting as the public spokesperson for the party after its leader, Ted Jolliffe, lost his seat in the Ontario general election on 4 June 1945. He also ran unsuccessfully several times for the House of Commons seat in what was then known as the Broadview electoral district during the 1940s. In August 1961, he was one of the co-chairs presiding over the New Democratic Party's founding convention in Ottawa. In 1968, he won the Award of Merit from the American Philological Association (APA) for his 1965 book The Greek and Roman Critics. The APA gave him the award for \\"outstanding contribution to classical scholarship.\\" Two- years later, while still the head of the classics department, he retired from UofT in 1970. He continued writing new translations of Plato's works until his death. In his later years, he had health issues, and he finally succumbed to them in Toronto on 13 December 1982.

Named for Benzie County, Michigan, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-266 was laid down on 11 November 1942 at Ambridge, Pennsylvania by the American Bridge Company; launched on 16 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph B. Barnwell; accepted and placed in reduced commission on 24 July 1943; departed Ambridge on 25 July 1943; and commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana on 4 August 1943. Service history After fitting out, LST-266 carried out her shakedown training in St. Andrews Bay until 28 August when she set out for Key West, Florida. Arriving there on 30 August, she joined coastal convoy KN-262 on 1 September and reached Little Creek, Virginia soon thereafter for operations in the Norfolk area and at Solomons Island, Maryland. The tank landing ship continued in the Hampton Roads region for the rest of 1943 and well into 1944. North Africa, March–April 1944 On 14 March 1944 she sailed for Tunisia as part of Task Force (TF) 64, in convoy UGS-36, 72 merchantmen and 18 tank landing ships shepherded by 16 warships. The escorts drove off a suspected U-boat late on 31 March, but danger from above replaced that from below just six hours later when 22 German aircraft attacked the convoy early on 1 April. In the ensuing action, the screen downed two enemy planes and probably damaged two others. As a result, UGS-36 reached its destination, Bizerte, on 3 April. LST-266 then stood out of that port on 12 April and made Oran, Algeria, on the 16th. From there, she sailed for the United Kingdom on 20 April in convoy MKS-46, reporting to the 12th Fleet for duty upon her arrival in British waters on 3 May 1944. Invasion of France, 7–17 June 1944 A little over a month later, LST-266 (as LST Flotilla 4 flagship) took part in Operation Neptune, the invasion of France. On 5 June, the tank landing ship departed Falmouth, England for the assault area in Task Group (TG) 126.4 made up of 40 LSTs, 35 of which towed pontoon causeways. The Channel's characteristic strong winds and heavy tidal currents made station keeping hazardous; but eventually, at 0800 on the 7th, TG 126.4 reached the invasion beaches; and LST-266 dropped anchor off the \\"Fox Green\\" section of Omaha Beach. Despite a choppy sea, the ship dispatched her first loaded landing craft, an LCM, to the beach at 1120; but the rough sea finally forced a pause in unloading at 1345. With 184 troops and 84 vehicles still on board, LST-266 persuaded a tank landing craft (LCT) to \\"marry\\" to her bow so that unloading could resume, an evolution aided by providentially calm wind and sea conditions. After three LCTs had been loaded and dispatched to the beach, more remained on board to send. Her executive officer, Lt. Wilbur H. Lundell, took a small boat out to look for a Rhino Ferry to speed the unloading. His hunt bore fruit; and, after marrying the Rhino Ferry to her bow at 2323, LST-266 completed her unloading at 0130 on the 8th. Later that day, LST-266 received orders to stand out for onward routing. \\"Ducking and dodging\\" convoys of LCTs on the return voyage, LST-266, one of 42 LSTs in convoy, reached the Isle of Portland on the morning of the 9th. From there, she accompanied 11 other tank landing ships to Tilbury Docks to load cargo, arriving there early on 12 June. Embarking 273 British troops and 72 vehicles, LST-266 anchored briefly in the River Thames before joining an out- bound convoy, ETM-8, in the late afternoon of the 13th. Arriving off Sword Beach, in the British sector, at 2245 on 14 June, LST-266 beached herself on \\"Queen Red\\" Beach, four miles west of Ouistreham, France at 0830 on the 15th along with five other U.S. tank landing ships. \\"Until 0930,\\" wrote Lieutenant Logan A. Bolon, USNR, LST-266's captain, \\"the beach was peaceful and free of enemy action, but at 0930 the peacefulness took a hasty departure, no doubt hurried along by the burst of an enemy shell five hundred yards on the port quarter.\\" As the tide receded enough to allow unloading, the Germans increased the tempo of their gunfire accordingly. Over the next few hours, enemy long- range guns methodically sowed the beach with shells. \\"I am fully convinced,\\" Bolon recounted, \\"that those manning the enemy guns were extremely capable and not green horns at the game. The range and deflection was good and salvoes varied from one to four. This vessel received one direct hit...and enough near misses to scare the daylights out of us...\\" Shortly before 1130, the nearby LST-207 took a direct hit, and immediately requested medical assistance. LST-266 provided a doctor and 14 pharmacist's mates to help the wounded; soon thereafter, at 1137, LST-266 herself took a hit at the normal load waterline, in a main ballast tank. About ten minutes later, the tank landing ships received orders to evacuate all hands save skeleton crews. At 1150, LST-266's crew went ashore and sought cover for the duration of the shelling, leaving behind a seven-man repair party, four motor machinist's mates, one chief pharmacist's mate, a doctor and two other officers. Even British warships, brought into the area a little over a half an hour later, failed to silence the enemy guns which continued to lob shells at the LSTs until 1630, inflicting damage on five of the six. Although she had dispatched her last vehicle to the beach at 1325, LST-266 could not retract from the beach because of the extreme tide conditions. Those men who had been evacuated returned a little over an hour later; and, at 1600, the tank landing ship began making all preparations for getting underway. Retracting soon thereafter on the second attempt, LST-266 proceeded to the out-bound convoy anchorage area and, from there, headed back to England, entering Portsmouth at 0235 on 17 June. Her repeated requests for repairs at British facilities ignored, LST-266 had to take matters into her own hands, and her own ship's force repaired the shell damage within 24 hours. Return to the US, 1945 LST-266 remained in European waters, carrying out cross-channel missions, into the spring of 1945. She then moved to Belfast in Northern Ireland where she joined a homeward- bound convoy, ONS-50, on 11 May, with nested on board. Detached from the convoy on the 27th, LST-266 proceeded to Norfolk, arriving there on the 31st to unload the landing craft and undergo voyage repairs. Although earmarked for Pacific service, LST-266 never reached that theater, spending the rest of her active days in the Atlantic. Following an availability at Norfolk during the summer of 1945, the tank landing ship steamed to New York, where she loaded and the stern section of . After carrying that cargo to Hampton Roads and unloading it at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, she returned to New York immediately to load for transportation to Jacksonville, Florida. Decommissioning and disposal Arriving at Green Cove Springs, Florida on 2 October 1945, she reported for duty with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet that same day. On 18 June 1947, LST-266 was decommissioned and placed in service, in reserve. A week later, on 25 June 1947, she was placed out of commission, in reserve. Towed from Mayport, Florida to Charleston, South Carolina by the three weeks later, LST-266 remained at the Charleston Naval Shipyard until 11 September when the towed her back to Mayport. On 1 July 1955, the tank landing ship was named USS Benzie County (LST-266), but never served actively under the name. On 1 November 1958 her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was sold to the Fleet Storage Company on 4 August 1959 for scrapping. LST-266 earned two battle stars for World War II service.

He represented the constituency of Alyn and Deeside in the National Assembly for Wales from 2003. Sargeant was removed from his Cabinet position and suspended from Welsh Labour on 3 November 2017 following allegations about his behaviour. He died four days later, reportedly taking his own life. On 11 July 2019, an inquest ruled his death a suicide. Background Sargeant was born in St Asaph, Flintshire, to Sylvia (née Hughes) and Malcolm Sargeant. Before becoming an Assembly Member, Sargeant worked as a process operator at the Warwick International Limited chemical manufacturing plant in Mostyn. He was also a quality and environmental auditor and a member of the site's Emergency Response Team. He trained as an industrial firefighter, and became a school governor of Deeside College and Ysgol Bryn Deva primary school.Carl Sargeant AM, National Assembly for Wales profile; accessed 7 November 2017Annie Kane, \\"Carl Sargeant new Welsh Natural Resources Minister\\", Resource.co, 11 September 2014; accessed 7 November 2017. He was married, with a son and daughter. Political career His political career began as an elected member of Connah's Quay town council. His political views developed following the ending of steel production at Shotton in 1980, which contributed to the area's high local unemployment rates. He became an active campaigner for social justice and against domestic violence, identifying as a feminist.Inside Housing - Insight - Get on board with equality Sargeant was first elected as the AM for Alyn and Deeside in the National Assembly for Wales election of 2003, after Tom Middlehurst stood down. He was appointed Chief Whip of the Labour Group and a Deputy Welsh Minister for Assembly Business in the Third Assembly of the Welsh Assembly Government (31 May 2007). He remained Labour Chief Whip when the One Wales coalition government of Labour and Plaid Cymru was announced on 19 July. In December 2009, he was made Minister for Social Justice and Local Government in the cabinet of the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. Speaking to the Flintshire Chronicle, Sargeant spoke of his pride in being the first person from North Wales to hold the post. Yes vote in the 2011 Welsh referendum. In June 2011, he dismissed the three commissioners of the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales, stating that the body \\"has lost the confidence of its stakeholders\\". The two others, also members of the Boundary Commission for Wales, resigned their posts there, leading to the start of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies being delayed in Wales. Following the 2016 National Assembly election, he was appointed as Cabinet Secretary for Communities and Children. He led the Welsh Government's response to the Grenfell Tower disaster in 2017. Amidst the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals he was suspended from the Labour Party and removed from his position on 3 November 2017, following unspecified allegations about his personal conduct. Death Sargeant was found dead at his home in Connah's Quay on 7 November 2017. North Wales Police said that they were not treating his death as suspicious. It was reported that Sargeant had taken his own life. At the opening of the inquest on 13 November, the coroner was told that his death was likely to have been due to hanging. The coroner also commented that the death was \\"an apparent act of self harm\\". The coroner recorded a conclusion of suicide on 11 July 2019. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described his death as \\"terrible and deeply shocking news\\". First Minister Carwyn Jones said, \\"He made a big contribution to Welsh public life and fought tirelessly for those he represented both as a minister and as a local Assembly Member\\". The afternoon session in the Welsh Assembly was suspended after the news of his death. Implications Following Sargeant's death, some politicians criticised the process that had led to his dismissal and suspension. Assembly Member Jenny Rathbone said that Sargeant had not been told details of the allegations that had been made against him, and other Labour members suggested that Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones needed to answer questions about how the situation had been handled. Sargeant's family released to the media copies of correspondence between his solicitor and Welsh Labour, in which Sargeant denied any inappropriate behaviour. The solicitor referred to \\"the anxiety and distress being caused to our client\\" (that is, Sargeant), and suggested that any delay in addressing the allegations would be \\"both prejudicial to the preparation of our client's case but also to his physical and mental wellbeing.\\" On 9 November 2017 Alun Michael, Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales and former First Secretary, asked Carwyn Jones, then First Minister of Wales, to set out the allegations made against Carl Sargeant. Former minister Leighton Andrews said that in earlier years Sargeant had been the target of bullying and disinformation in the Assembly which had placed \\"a strain on his and others' mental health,\\" and that this was known to Jones. UK Independence Party Welsh Assembly member Neil Hamilton called for Jones to resign over the matter, saying that the suspension of Sargeant was both \\"heartless and in breach of the most fundamental principle of natural justice – giving the accused the right to defend himself.\\" Sargeant's family called for a public inquiry into the way he had been treated. In a statement on 9 November, Carwyn Jones said that, once he had received allegations regarding inappropriate touching or groping by Sargeant, he had had no alternative but to dismiss him. The following day, Jones announced that an independent inquiry into his actions would take place. Sargeant's death triggered a by-election for his seat which was held on 6 February 2018. Sargeant's son Jack was selected as the Labour candidate, and was elected to the seat. On 21 April 2018, Carwyn Jones said at the Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno that he would stand down as First Minister by the end of the year, saying that he had been through the \\"darkest of times\\" since Sargeant's death.

He then moved to Rome, where he worked in the studios of Nicolas Poussin and Pietro da Cortona. In 1641, he traveled to the Veneto (mainly Venice and Padua) to work with Domenico Maroli, established relationships with the Borromeo family in Padua and returned, in 1650, to Messina. In 1678, he fled the city to avoid Spanish repression, seeking refuge initially in France and then in Padua, Mantua, and Ancona. Pardoned, he returned to Messina in 1701. He died in 1706, in Gesso. Many of his paintings in Messina were destroyed by the earthquakes of 1783 and 1908. Only his Madonna del Soccorso remains presently in the Museo Regionale. In Milazzo, he painted in the churches of San Giuseppe and San Papino. Other paintings by Onofrio Gabrieli are in the following Sicilian towns: Siracusa, Randazzo, Monforte San Giorgio, Contesse, and Gesso.

Its name is derived from the acronym FESTAC, which stands for Second World African Festival of Arts and Culture that was held there in 1977.\\"FESTAC Roads in deplorable condition\\", The Punch, Saturday, 29 November 2008. It is also important to know that festac is under Amuwo-Odofin local government area in Lagos.  History  Festac town, originally referred to as \\"Festival Town\\" or \\"Festac Village\\", is a residential estate designed to house the participants of the Second World Festival of Black Arts and Culture of 1977 (Festac77). Consisting of 5,000 contemporary dwelling units and seven major avenues, the town was designed in an efficient grid in order to accommodate upwards of 45,000 visitors as well as any Nigerian employees and officers working at the Festival.\\"Life in the Village,\\" Festival News 1, no. 11 (1977), p. 4. The Nigerian government invested substantial sums of money and resources into building Festac Town, which sported state of the art electrical generators, police and fire stations, access to public transportation, supermarkets, banks, health centres, public restrooms, and postal services.Andrew Apter. The Pan-African Nation: Oil and the Spectacle of Culture in Nigeria. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005, p. 49. The village was therefore intended to evoke the modern age and the promise of state-sponsored economic development fuelled by oil revenues. After the Festival, the Federal Government of Nigeria allocated the housing and landed properties to eventual winners who participated in a ballot. Initial regulations forbade such winners from renting and disposing-of the properties to third parties. The first festival was held in 1966 at Dakar, Senegal.

Layout  Festac town is built in a grid network consisting of seven major roads/boulevards or avenues from which minor roads extend. These avenues are identified by their numbers: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Avenues respectively. The 1st, 2nd, 4th and 7th Avenues surround a portion of the town in what seems like an almost rectangular road network which are connected and accessible through each other. The 3rd and 5th avenues run parallel within the town. The 6th avenue is found in a portion of the town accessible through a bridge from the 1st Avenue. The town consists of cul-de-sacs or closes which are named in an alphabetical format. Festac town is accessible from the Lagos- Badagry Expressway through three main gates that open into the 1st, 2nd and 7th avenues and are called the First, Second and Third gates respectively. The town is also accessible through the Festac Link Bridge.  Status  The status of FESTAC Town is somewhat confusing as the Federal, State and Local Government all lay claim to the management of the estate and occasionally issue the residents with various charges ranging from valuation fees, local government levies to tenement rates.  Media  FESTAC town has over the years evolved and has become a city of its own, the town has had various information dissemination platforms such as Festaconline which has become a household media brand that dishes out information, happenings in Festac Town, Mile 2 and the entire Local Government Area, Amuwo Odofin, Lagos State  Commercial and Leisure Activities  Once a sleepy estate, FESTAC Town has in the past few years attracted varied forms of businesses within the estate and its environs. Today, there is a growing number of commercial banks, and shopping complexes that cater to the residents. There are also several hotels and hangout spots within the estate which have contributed to the vibrant night life.

Ananus was deposed by Agrippa II before Albinus' arrival.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 9, Section 1 Immediately upon his arrival in Jerusalem, Albinus began an effort to remove the sicarii from the region. Josephus also records that Albinus became the friend of a High Priest named Ananias due to the priest's gift- giving.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 9, Section 2 The sicarii responded to Albinus's efforts by capturing an assistant to the priest Eleazar, son of Ananias, and demanding the release of ten imprisoned sicarii in exchange for the assistant. The release was arranged by Ananias.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 9, Section 3 When Albinus learned that he was to be succeeded by Gessius Florus, he emptied the prisons by executing prisoners charged with more serious offenses and allowing the remaining prison population to pay for their release.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book 20, Chapter 9, Section 5 Following his time in Judea, Albinus was chosen by Nero to be governor of Mauretania Caesariensis. The province of Mauretania Tingitana was added to Albinus's governor duties by the Emperor Galba. Following Galba's death, Albinus supported Otho in the year of political anarchy (69), which followed Nero's death.Tacitus, The Histories, Volume II, Section 58 Following Otho's death, Albinus was rumored to have styled himself as a king using the title \\"Juba\\". Albinus and his wife were assassinated shortly afterwards.Tacitus, The Histories, Volume II, Section 59 Albinus was succeeded by Gessius Florus  See also  * Prefects, Procurators, and Legates of Roman Judaea * List of Roman governors of Mauretania Tingitana  Notes  References  * * * Category:1st-century Romans Category:1st-century Roman governors of Judea Category:Roman governors of Mauretania Tingitana Category:1st-century deaths Albinus Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Lucceius Albinus"},{"id":"10446858","text":"Brittas (, meaning “wooden parapet”) is a rural village in the jurisdiction of South Dublin, just north of the border with County Wicklow on the N81 road.

Each book in the series contains an individual main story followed by a back-up story with a plot that continues through all four books. The main story in each book focuses on a different fictional character, each of whom has had associations with magic in previous Marvel publications. The four characters featured are Magik, the Black Knight, the Scarlet Witch, and Sister Grimm. Artist Marko Djurdjevic illustrated the cover for each issue. History Prior to the release of the series, Marvel.com reporter Jim Beard reported that Mystic Arcana would be in the same vein as \\"the wild and woolly genre revitalization, Annihilation.\\" As part of his report Beard interviewed Mystic Arcana's editor Mark Paniccia who explained: When the Mystic Arcana series was introduced at the 2007 New York Comic Convention in New York City at the Marvel Comics \\"Cup 'O Joe\\" panel, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada announced that the series would be published under the creative control of Tarot deck artist David Sexton. In an interview at Comic Book Resources, creative director David Sexton gave an in-depth view of his goals for the Mystic Arcana series: Format Each issue of Mystic Arcana contains a 22-page main story, and a 10-page back-up story. The main stories in each revolve around the introduction of one of four different groups of \\"mystical implements\\" (which Beard describes as \\"pillars of the [Marvel] Universe\\" and David Sexton calls \\"The Cornerstones of Creation\\"). The back-up stories focus on the quest of Ian McNee, one time Dr. Strange adversary, to collect one implement from each of The Cornerstones of Creation. Individual issues of the Mystic Arcana series corresponds to one of the four classical Greek elements and features a different Marvel character. Additionally, David Sexton explains,\\"the series is called Mystic Arcana because the Minor Arcana of the Tarot will serve as the unifying element to the stories.\\" Sexton cites the character Magik as the representative of the Tarot minor arcana suit of swords, Black Knight for the suit of pentacles, Scarlet Witch for the suit of cups, and Nico Minoru for the suit of wands. Information on the focus of each issue and their different creative teams is as follows: :*Mystic Arcana Book I: Air (focusing on Illyana Rasputin/Magik). Author: Louise Simonson. Pencils: Steve Scott. :*Mystic Arcana Book II: Earth (focusing on Sir Percy of Scandia, the Black Knight). Author: Roy Thomas (with plotting assist by Jean-Marc Lofficier). Pencils: Tom Grummett & Scott Hanna. :*Mystic Arcana Book III: Water (focusing on Wanda Maximoff/The Scarlet Witch). Author: Jeff Parker. Pencils: Juan Santacruz. :*Mystic Arcana Book IV: Fire (focusing on Nico Minoru/Sister Grimm) Author: C. B. Cebulski. Pencils: Phil Noto. A fifth book, The Marvel Tarot, which is related to, but separate from the four issue series, focuses on Ian McNee with various Marvel archetypal characters appearing on Tarot Cards. The Marvel Tarot was written and illustrated by David Sexton with Doug Sexton and Jeff Christiansen. Plot=Mystic Arcana: Magik Former New Mutants writer Louise Simonson's one-shot \\"Time Trial\\" features Illyana Rasputin and Egyptian sorceress Ashake, with minor appearances by Danielle Moonstar, alias Mirage, of the New Mutants and Egyptian necromancer Heka-Nut. The story takes place during the events of New Mutants #32, during which Magik misguides one of her teleportation discs through the space-time continuum and strands the pair in ancient Egypt. Mirage and Magik are immediately beset by guards but rescued by Ashake, who reveals herself to be the grandmother of Ororo Munroe, alias Storm, though many generations removed. While Mirage sleeps under the cover of an invisibility spell, necromancer Heka-Nut captures Ashake and Magik and forces them to retrieve a mystical artifact called the \\"Sword of Bone,\\" with which he intends to pursue his own selfish ends. After retrieving the Sword of Bone, Magik disrupts Heka-Nut with her Soulsword, and severs him from his mystical energy; Ashake bottles Heka-Nut's energy in a canopic jar given to her by Egyptian goddess Ma'at. Ashake returns the Sword of Bone to its hiding place under the watch of Ma'at's sphinx servant Ammut and swears to hide Heka-Nut's bottled energy, while Magik and Mirage return home. \\"In 'The Mystic Arcana Book I: Air,' readers are introduced to a very special deck of Tarot cards [called The First Tarot]. The cards are magically connected with the world around them and they magically transform to represent the \\"real person\\" (i.e. Marvel character) that most embodies that particular card.\\" Mystic Arcana: Black Knight Roy Thomas' one-shot, simply titled \\"The Black Knight,\\" takes place in Avalon during the 6th century A.D.. The wizard Merlin finds Sir Percy of Scandia, the Black Knight of Marvel's Arthurian era, at the end of a battle and informs Percy that King Arthur is holding off an attack by his nephew Mordred alone at Percy's castle in Scandia. Percy rushes to Arthur's rescue, but arrives in time to see Arthur fatally wounded by Mordred. As Percy avenges his fallen king, he recalls an encounter with Welsh god Gwyn ap Nudd, a hunter spirit and harbinger of spring, during which Gwyn predicted that Percy would become a warrior and \\"the hand of fate.\\" The story then progresses to detail how Percy came to be the Black Knight under Merlin's supervision. When the narrative returns to the present, Percy has bested all the insurgent warriors save for Mordred, who hides behind a tapestry and prepares to assassinate Percy from behind. Percy senses Mordred and purposely turns his back to lure the traitor from his hiding place, but Merlin conjures two visions for Percy to consider in the moments before Mordred makes his attack. The first vision shows Percy murdered but the mantle of the Black Knight remains untainted, while the second vision shows Percy defeating Mordred, but the mantle of the Black Knight is corrupted. Percy chooses to let Mordred kill him, thus ensuring that his legacy remains clean, and is rewarded by becoming the new visage of Gwyn ap Nudd. Mystic Arcana: Scarlet Witch Jeff Parker and Juan Santacruz tell a story of Wanda Maximoff when she was a Gypsy child. She meets Gregor and Maria Russoff, Lilia Calderu (queen of the Gypsies, wearing the Serpent Crown) and Margali Szardos who get attacked by Taboo (owner of the Darkhold) and Damballah. Mystic Arcana: Sister Grimm Nico Minoru discovers her family's heirloom, the Black Mirror, which was stolen from Marie LeVeau. The mirror is the last piece of the mystic \\"Cornerstones of Creation.\\" Unbeknownst to Nico, the mirror itself is not the cornerstone, but the dark reflection it casts is. Only Nico's blood can activate the mirror and release the true cornerstone, the last page from the Darkhold. Ian McNee subplot In Mystic Arcana: Magik, McNee's journey begins in the mystical Serpent's Sea as he is drowning and freezing to death; he claims to be ignorant of who sent him there or why they want him dead. He invokes the deity Oshtur and she offers to save him if he helps to restore the magician Heka-Nut, the villain of Ashake and Magick's quest, with mystical power to save the magical realms. Ian agrees and Oshtur charges him to find the Cornerstones of Creation, the \\"aces\\" of the First Tarot. He begins by locating the sphinx Ammut, disguised as an ordinary woman, and invokes a contest for possession of the Sword of Bone: Ammut will pose a riddle to McNee, and if McNee guesses correctly, Ammut surrenders the Sword, but if McNee guesses incorrectly, Ammut will eat McNee's mind. McNee guesses correctly and gains the Sword of Bone, the Cornerstone of Air, disguised as a sword-shaped pendant on a necklace. Ammut then informs McNee his next task is to retrieve the Ebony Rose, the Cornerstone of Earth, from Morgan Le Fay. Mystic Arcana: Black Knight finds McNee fighting his way into Avalon to meet Morgan Le Fay. He finally arrives and respectfully pleads with Le Fay to hand over the Rose for the sake of the magical universe. Le Fay discovers that McNee used a charm to make his voice sound more like her (Le Fay's) former mentor and lover Merlin in order to sway her more easily. She concludes that not only does McNee sound like Merlin, but he also acts \\"mischievous\\" like Merlin, and out of respect for the old wizard's memory, Le Fay tells Ian where he can find the Ebony Rose. Ian retrieves it, and Le Fay tells him that he will next travel beneath the ocean to a place she \\"once believed was Avalon,\\" guarded by an old serpent, where McNee will presumably seek the Cornerstone of Water. Unlike in the McNee subplot in Mystic Arcana: Magik, the second chapter of McNee's quest does not directly correlate to the objects or events in the main story. In Mystic Arcana: Scarlet Witch McNee fights Nagala and Llyra to recover the Serpent Crown. In Mystic Arcana: Sister Grimm McNee is quietly working in his shop when Marie LeVeau steps in. LeVeau gives a gift that he reluctantly accepts. It is the last page of the infamous Darkhold she received from the Dark Mirror. LeVeau states that she has turned a new leaf and wants to help Ian. With that, she disappears in a cloud of smoke. Almost immediately after, the Bright Lady appears and instructs Ian to perform the ritual. Ian questions Oshtur's choice of him to perform the task, stating that perhaps Dr. Strange would be better suited to the spell. Oshtur urges him to complete the spell and Ian finally agrees. Once the Cornerstones are gathered, Ian begins by connecting to the guardians of the other three cornerstones, Llyra, Morgan Le Fay, and Ashake. After Ian successfully breaks the spell containing the essence of Heka-Nut, Oshtur finally reveals that she is in fact not Oshtur, but the Darklord Chthon. Chthon reveals his plans of world domination using the four cornerstones, at which point Ian and the others counter Chthon's deception and begin to attack him. Ashake pleads with Heka-Nut to remember his humanity and the goodness that is within him. They rekindle their friendship and Ashake releases his soul from Ian's body by slicing through his spirit with the Sword of Bone. With the spell broken, the sorcerers are released from the chaotic swirl of mystic energy. Somehow, Ashake is pulled from her timeline into the present. Chthon tells Ian that because he used the Darkhold's magic to restore the balance between the cornerstones, he tainted his soul and part of it now belongs to Chthon. Ian loses a part of his soul and Ashake is now \\"lost\\" in the present. At this point, the real Oshtur reveals herself and tells the heroes that all is not lost and the balance in magic must truly be restored. She instructs them to rest, as they will be the sorcerers charged with restoring that balance.

Fate mapping is a method used in developmental biology to study the embryonic origin of various adult tissues and structures. The \\"fate\\" of each cell or group of cells is mapped onto the embryo, showing which parts of the embryo will develop into which tissue. When carried out at single-cell resolution, this process is called cell lineage tracing. It is also used to trace the development of tumors. History The earliest fate maps were based on direct observation of the embryos of ascidians or other marine invertebrates. Modern fate mapping began in 1929 when Walter Vogt marked the groups of cells using a dyed agar chip and tracked them through gastrulation. In 1978, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was introduced as a marker. HRP was more effective than previous markers, but required embryos to be fixed before viewing. Genetic fate mapping is a technique developed in 1981 which uses a site-specific recombinase to track cell lineage genetically. Today, fate mapping is an important tool in many fields of biology research, such as developmental biology, stem cell research, and kidney research.  Cell lineage  C. elegans. Fate mapping and cell lineage are similar but distinct topics, although there is often overlap. For example, the development of the complete cell lineage of C. elegans can be described as the fate maps of each cell division stacked hierarchically. The distinction between the topics is in the type of information included. Fate mapping shows which tissues come from which part of the embryo at a certain stage in development, whereas cell lineage shows the relationships between cells at each division. A cell lineage can be used to generate a fate map, and in cases like C. elegans, successive fate mapping is used to develop a cell lineage. Method Fate mapping is accomplished by inserting a heritable genetic mark into a cell. Typically, this is a fluorescent protein. Therefore, any progeny of the cell will have this genetic mark. It can also be done through the use of molecular barcodes, which are introduced to the cell by retroviruses.

Its texture is similar to the Chinese beef ball, fish ball, or pork ball. The word bakso may refer to a single meatball or the complete dish of meatball soup. Mie bakso refers to bakso served with yellow noodles and rice vermicelli, while bakso kuah refers to bakso soup served without noodles. Bakso can be found all across Indonesia, from street vendors to high-class restaurants. Along with soto, satay, and siomay, bakso is one of the most popular street foods in Indonesia. Today, various types of ready-to-cook bakso are also available as frozen foods sold in supermarkets in Indonesia. Ingredients, contents, and serving Bakso with noodle and bean sprouts. Bakso is commonly made from finely ground beef with a small quantity of tapioca flour and salt, however bakso can also be made from other ingredients, such as chicken, pork, fish or shrimp. Unlike other meatball recipes, bakso has a consistent firm, dense, homogeneous texture due to the polymerization of myosin in the beef surimi. As most Indonesians are Muslims which observes halal dietary law, generally bakso is made from beef, chicken or the mixture of beef with chicken. While in non-Muslim majority areas, such as in Chinatowns in major cities and Hindu majority island of Bali, pork bakso might be found. Traditionally the beef surimi paste or dough is made into balls by hand and boiled in hot water. After the meat is done, the meatballs are dried and served or refrigerated for later use. Pre-cooked bakso are usually displayed in the windows of street vendor carts. Bakso are usually served in a bowl of beef broth, with yellow noodles, bihun (rice vermicelli), salted vegetables, tofu, egg (wrapped within bakso), Chinese broccoli, bean sprout, siomay or steamed meat dumpling, and crisp wonton, sprinkled with fried shallots and celery. Slices of bakso are often used and mixed as complements in mi goreng, nasi goreng, or cap cai recipes. Origin Bakso Malang. The name bakso originated from bak-so (, ), the Hokkien pronunciation for \\"fluffy meat\\" or \\"minced meat\\". This suggests that bakso has Indonesian Chinese cuisine origin. Chinese influences is apparent in Indonesian food, such as bakmi, mie ayam, pangsit, mie goreng, kwetiau goreng, bakso, and lumpia. Indeed, bakso texture is quite similar to Chinese beef balls, which is quite fluffy and has homogenous texture. Although bakso has Chinese Hokkien origin name, culinary experts suggests that it is likely that bakso was the mixture of culinary influences back in colonial Dutch East Indies. Also in Indonesian, the term bola daging is often refer to Western or European style of meatballs, which is different in texture and elasticity compared to bakso. For example, Swedish meatballs are translated as bola daging Swedia in Indonesian. The soup and the noodles probably originated in China, but the meatball, may have come from the Dutch, who colonized Indonesia in the 19th century. Bakso cuanki from Bandung. Despite its possible Chinese origin, bakso seems to had undergone localization, especially into Chinese Indonesian and Javanese cuisine. Today, most of the bakso vendors are native Javanese from Wonogiri (a town near Solo) and Malang. Bakso Solo and Bakso Malang are the most popular variant; the name comes from the city it comes from, Solo in Central Java and Malang in East Java. Bakso Solo is usually served with yellow noodle and rice vermicelli in beef broth, while Bakso Malang usually is enrichen with tofu and crispy fried wonton. In Malang, bakso bakar (roasted bakso) is also popular. In Bandung, West Java, there is a type of bakso called bakso cuanki, which is quite similar with bakso Malang. In can contains various type of bakso ingredients; such as bakso aci, siomay dumpling, boiled wonton, fried wonton, fried bakso, served with scallion and broth soup. Variations Bakso bakar, grilled and skewered bakso. Bakso beranak, small baksos inside a bigger bakso. Indonesia has developed numerous bakso variants, usually differing in shape, size, texture, ingredients, and fillings. * Bakso aci: meatball with more tapioca content * Bakso ayam: chicken bakso * Bakso babi: pork meatball * Bakso bakar: grilled and skewered bakso, prepared in a similar fashion to satay * Bakso beranak: big meatball filled with small meatballs * Bakso bola tenis tennis ball-sized bakso, either filled with hard boiled egg as bakso telur or filled with tetelan which includes pieces of spare beef meat and fat or urat (tendon). * Bakso cuanki: a famous bakso in Bandung, West Java * Bakso gepeng: flat beef bakso, it usually has finer and more homogenous texture * Bakso goreng: fried bakso with a rather hard texture, usually consumed solely as a snack or mixed in one bowl as part of bakso Malang or bakso cuanki * Bakso ikan: fish bakso (fish ball) * Bakso keju: a modern variant of bakso, filled with either cheddar or mozarella cheese * Bakso kotak: cube-shaped bakso * Bakso Malang: bakso dish from the city of Malang in East Java; complete with noodles, tofu, siomay, and fried wontons * Bakso mercon: lit. \\"fire cracker bakso\\", refer to an extra hot and spicy bakso filled with sambal made of chilli pepper and birds eye chili pepper * Bakso tahu: bakso meat dough filled into tofu * Bakso telur: a tennis ball-sized bakso with hard boiled chicken egg wrapped inside * Bakso udang: shrimp bakso with a slightly pink color * Bakso urat: bakso filled with tendons and coarse meat Condiments Bakso garnished with bawang goreng fried shallot.

The following condiments and accompaniments are often added upon a bowl of bakso: * Bawang goreng crisp fried shallot sprinkled upon bakso * Kecap manis or sweet soy sauce, to add mild sweetness * Sambal chili paste to add spiciness * Bottled hot sauce * Ketchup tomato sauce * Vinegar to add sourness * Tongcay preserved salted vegetables Popularity Travelling bakso vendor on bike. Bakso is one of the most popular street foods in Indonesian cities and villages alike. Travelling street vendors, either by carts or bikes are often frequenting residential areas in Indonesia, while bakso warung and humble tent food stalls are often sprung on street sides in Indonesian cities. Bakso came to international attention when the United States President Barack Obama remembered it as one of his favourite foods from his childhood in Indonesia, and mentioned it in his speech. Similar dishes Similar meatball dishes can be found in other Southeast Asian cuisines, such as those in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Singapore, as well as Chinese-style meatballs. The dish also similar with Vietnamese noodle soup with meatballs, Phở Bò Viên. In Vietnam, Phở means noodle soup while Bò Viên is meatballs. Phở Bò Viên is one of version of Pho dish in Vietnam. It has been considered as the national dish of Vietnam. In Malaysia and Singapore, there is a similar meatball soup called bebola daging, which actually a Malay translation of \\"meatball\\". Many recipe of bebola daging in Malaysia and Singapore are actually derived from either Western (Indian or European) and Eastern (Chinese) meatballs, such as bebola daging Masala which is derived from Indian cuisine influence. In the Philippines, meatballs are called almondigas or bola-bola, and are usually served in a misua noodle soup with toasted garlic, squash, and pork cracklings. Bola-bolas are also stewed or pan-fried until golden brown. Health issue Bunch of pre-cooked bakso offered in supermarket refrigerator. In the past, borax and formalin is often added into beef surimi mixture in order to preserve the produced bakso, also to make bakso more chewy (from borax induced myosin cross-linking) with less usage of meat. As a result, bakso is often listed by Indonesian Food and Drug Administration as an unhealthy foodstuff.

Other English language translations include St. Pauli Landing Stages or St. Pauli Landing Bridges. The piers are located in the St. Pauli area of Hamburg, between the lower harbour and the Fischmarkt (Fish Market), on the banks of the Elbe river. The Landungsbrücken today form a central transportation hub, with S-Bahn, U-Bahn and ferry stations, and are also a major tourist magnet with numerous restaurants and departure points for harbour pleasure boats. There is an entrance to the Old Elbe tunnel at the western end of the Landungsbrücken. The eastern end of the building complex is marked by the Pegelturm (water level tower). Halfway up the tower, there is a water level indicator built into the wall, which indicates the current stage of the tides. Shipping piers Landungsbrücken building The first pier here was built in 1839 at what was then the edge of the harbour. It served as a terminal for steamships, which could be relatively easily filled with coal here. The pier ensured a sufficient security distance from the city, since these ships were fueled by coal which presented a fire risk. The current piers built in 1907 consist of floating pontoons, which are accessible from land by ten movable bridges. The long landing place originally served the passenger steamers of the overseas lines. Among others, the great Hapag-Lloyd liners landed here. Today only the HADAG ferries, harbour tour ships and motor launches, passenger ships serving the lower Elbe, and catamarans to Stade and Helgoland still travel to the piers. Ships travel from here daily to the musical island of the concert, \\"The Lion King\\". Shipping pier The old piers were destroyed during the Second World War, so today's pontoons were rebuilt between 1953 and 1955. The last section destroyed in the War, between bridges 2 and 3, was not rebuilt until 1976. During the modernisation begun in 1999, the roofing and lighting were updated. Part of this modernisation is planned to include replacing bridge 7. Cultural monument The terminal building, built from volcanic tuff, and the piers were constructed between 1907 and 1909 in the same location as the old Landungsbrücken. It was designed as a representative shipping station by the architectural company of Raabe & Wöhlecke for the department of river and harbour construction of the construction deputation. With its length of 205 m, its numerous gateways to the ships' piers, its domes and towers, it sets a structural accent. The architectural sculptures were created by Arthur Bock. The complex was classified as a historical monument on 15 September 2003. Public transport interchange U-Bahn entrance, \\"Hafentor\\" A connection with the S-Bahn and U-Bahn is provided through Landungsbrücken station. Stammsiel One of Hamburg's oldest and largest sewerage systems is near the Landungsbrücken. It is part of the \\"Stadtwasserkunst\\" designed by William Lindley in 1842. The Geest-Stammsiel collects sewage from far parts of the city before it is transported under the Elbe to the main purification plant Köhlbrandhöft on the opposite side of the Elbe, by means of a pumping station about 100 m upstream of the old Elbe tunnel. The sluice can be travelled by boat. For the rowing trips of Kaiser Willhelm II, a separate underground dock was constructed, viewable by appointment.

A MLM may be an illegal pyramid scheme. In an MLM, the compensation plan theoretically pays out to participants only from two potential revenue streams. The first is paid out from commissions of sales made by the participants directly to their own retail customers. The second is paid out from commissions based upon the wholesale purchases made by other distributors below the participant who have recruited those other participants into the MLM; in the organizational hierarchy of MLMs, these participants are referred to as one's down line distributors. MLM salespeople are, therefore, expected to sell products directly to end-user retail consumers by means of relationship referrals and word of mouth marketing, but most importantly they are incentivized to recruit others to join the company's distribution chain as fellow salespeople so that these can become down line distributors. According to a report that studied the business models of 350 MLMs, published on the Federal Trade Commission's website, at least 99% of people who join MLM companies lose money. Nonetheless, MLMs function because downline participants are encouraged to hold onto the belief that they can achieve large returns, while the statistical improbability of this is de- emphasised. MLMs have been made illegal or otherwise strictly regulated in some jurisdictions as merely variations of the traditional pyramid scheme, including in mainland China. Terminology Multi-level marketing is also known as pyramid selling, network marketing, and referral marketing. Business model=Participants The overwhelming majority of MLM participants (most sources estimated to be over 99.25% of all MLM distributors) participate at either an insignificant or nil net profit. Indeed, the largest proportion of participants must operate at a net loss (after expenses are deducted) so that the few individuals in the uppermost level of the MLM pyramid can derive their significant earnings. Said earnings are then emphasized by the MLM company to all other participants to encourage their continued participation at a continuing financial loss. Companies Many MLM companies do generate billions of dollars in annual revenue and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profit. However, the profits of the MLM company are accrued at the detriment to the majority of the company's constituent workforce (the MLM participants). Only some of said profit is then significantly shared with individual participants at the top of the MLM distributorship pyramid. The earnings of those top few participants is emphasized and championed at company seminars and conferences, thus creating an illusion of how one can potentially become financially successful if they become a participant in the MLM. This is then advertised by the MLM company to recruit more distributors to participate in the MLM with a false anticipation of earning margins which are in reality merely theoretical and statistically improbable. Although an MLM company holds out those few top individual participants as evidence of how participation in the MLM could lead to success, the MLM business model depends on the failure of the overwhelming majority of all other participants, through the injecting of money from their own pockets, so that it can become the revenue and profit of the MLM company, of which the MLM company shares only a small proportion of it to a few individuals at the very top of the MLM participant pyramid. Participants, other than the few individuals at the top, provide nothing more than their own financial loss for the company's own profit and the profit of the top few individual participants. Financial independence The main sales pitch of MLM companies to their participants and prospective participants is not the MLM company's products or services. The products/services are largely peripheral to the MLM model. Rather, the true sales pitch and emphasis is on a confidence given to participants of potential financial independence through participation in the MLM, luring with phrases like \\"the lifestyle you deserve\\" or \\"independent distributor.\\" Erik German's memoir My Father's Dream documents the real life failures of German's father as he is lured into \\"get-rich-quick\\" schemes such as Amway. The memoir illustrates the multi-level marketing sales principle known as \\"selling the dream\\". Although the emphasis is always made on the potential of success and the positive life change that \\"might\\" or \\"could\\" (not \\"will\\" or \\"can\\") result, it is only in otherwise difficult to find disclosure statements (or at the very least, challenging to read and interpret disclosure statements). MLM participants are given fine print disclaimers that they, as participants, should not rely on the earning results of other participants in the highest levels of the MLM participant pyramid as an indication of what they should expect to earn. MLMs rarely emphasize the extreme likelihood of failure, or the extreme likelihood of financial loss, from participation in MLM. MLMs are also seldom forthcoming about the fact that any significant success of the few individuals at the top of the MLM participant pyramid is, in fact, dependent on the continued financial loss and failure of all other participants below them in the MLM pyramid. Comparisons to pyramid schemes MLMs have been made illegal in some jurisdictions as a mere variation of the traditional pyramid scheme, including in China. In jurisdictions where MLMs have not been made illegal, many illegal pyramid schemes attempt to present themselves as MLM businesses. Given that the overwhelming majority of MLM participants cannot realistically make a net profit, let alone a significant net profit, but instead overwhelmingly operate at net losses, some sources have defined all MLMs as a type of pyramid scheme, even if they have not been made illegal like traditional pyramid schemes through legislative statutes. MLMs are designed to make profit for the owners/shareholders of the company and a few individual participants at the top levels of the MLM pyramid of participants. According to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), some MLM companies already constitute illegal pyramid schemes even by the narrower existing legislation, exploiting members of the organization. Lawsuits Companies that use the MLM business model have been a frequent subject of criticism and lawsuits. Legal claims against MLMs have included, among other things: *their similarity to traditional illegal pyramid schemes *price fixing of products or services, *collusion and racketeering in backroom deals where secret compensation packages are created between the MLM company and a few individual participants, to the detriment of others *high initial entry costs (for marketing kit and first products), *emphasis on recruitment of others over actual sales (especially sales to non-participants) *encouraging if not requiring members to purchase and use the company's products, *exploitation of personal relationships as both sales and recruiting targets, *complex and exaggerated compensation schemes, *false product claims *the company or leading distributors making major money off participant- attended conventions, training events and materials, advertising materials, and *cult-like techniques which some groups use to enhance their members' enthusiasm and devotion. Direct selling versus network marketing \\"Network marketing\\" and \\"multi-level marketing\\" (MLM) have been described by author Dominique Xardel as being synonymous, with it being a type of direct selling. Some sources emphasize that multi-level marketing is merely one form of direct selling, rather than being direct selling. Other terms that are sometimes used to describe multi-level marketing include \\"word-of-mouth marketing\\", \\"interactive distribution\\", and \\"relationship marketing\\". Critics have argued that the use of these and other different terms and \\"buzzwords\\" is an effort to distinguish multi-level marketing from illegal Ponzi schemes, chain letters, and consumer fraud scams. The Direct Selling Association (DSA), a lobbying group for the MLM industry, reported that in 1990 only 25% of DSA members used the MLM business model. By 1999, this had grown to 77.3%. (citing Neil Offen, president of the Direct Selling Association) By 2009, 94.2% of DSA members were using MLM, accounting for 99.6% of sellers, and 97.1% of sales. Companies such as Avon, Electrolux, Tupperware, and Kirby were all originally single-level marketing companies, using that traditional and uncontroversial direct selling business model (distinct from MLM) to sell their goods. However, they later introduced multi- level compensation plans, becoming MLMs. The DSA has approximately 200 members while it is estimated there are over 1,000 firms using multi-level marketing in the United States alone. History The origin of multi-level marketing is often disputed; but multi-level marketing style businesses existed in the 1920s, 1930s California Vitamin Company, (later named Nutrilite) or California Perfume Company (renamed as \\"Avon Products\\"). Setup A typical Multi-level marketing MLM binary tree structure. The blue individual will receive compensation from the sales of the downline red members. Independent non- salaried participants, referred to as distributors (variously called \\"associates\\", \\"independent business owners\\", \\"independent agents\\", etc.), are authorized to distribute the company's products or services. They are awarded their own immediate retail profit from customers plus commission from the company, not downlines, through a multi-level marketing compensation plan, which is based upon the volume of products sold through their own sales efforts as well as that of their downline organization. Independent distributors develop their organizations by either building an active consumer network, who buy direct from the company, or by recruiting a downline of independent distributors who also build a consumer network base, thereby expanding the overall organization. The combined number of recruits from these cycles are the sales force which is referred to as the salesperson's \\"downline\\". This \\"downline\\" is the pyramid in MLM's multiple level structure of compensation. Income levels Several sources have commented on the income level of specific MLMs or MLMs in general: *The Times: \\"The Government investigation claims to have revealed that just 10% of Amway's agents in Britain make any profit, with less than one in ten selling a single item of the group's products.\\" *Eric Scheibeler, a high level \\"Emerald\\" Amway member: \\"UK Justice Norris found in 2008 that out of an IBO [Independent Business Owners] population of 33,000, 'only about 90 made sufficient incomes to cover the costs of actively building their business.' That's a 99.7 percent loss rate for investors.\\" (in reference to BERR vs Amway (Case No:2651, 2652 and 2653 of 2007) in point of objectionability\\"c\\") *Newsweek: based on Mona Vie's own 2007 income disclosure statement \\"fewer than 1 percent qualified for commissions and of those, only 10 percent made more than $100 a week.\\" *Business Students Focus on Ethics: \\"In the USA, the average annual income from MLM for 90% MLM members is no more than US $5,000, which is far from being a sufficient means of making a living (San Lian Life Weekly 1998)\\" *USA Today has had several articles: :*\\"While earning potential varies by company and sales ability, DSA says the median annual income for those in direct sales is $2,400.\\" :*In an October 15, 2010 article, it was stated that documents of a MLM called Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing reveal that 30 percent of its representatives make no money and that 54 percent of the remaining 70 percent only make $93 a month, before costs. Fortune was under investigation by the Attorneys General of Texas, Kentucky, North Dakota, and North Carolina with Missouri, South Carolina, Illinois, and Florida following up complaints against the company. The FTC eventually stated that Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing was a pyramid scheme and that checks totaling more than $3.7 million were being mailed to the victims.FTC (8 November 2016) \\"FTC Returns More Than $3.7 Million to People Harmed by Pyramid Scheme\\" :*A February 10, 2011 article stated \\"It can be very difficult, if not impossible, for most individuals to make a lot of money through the direct sale of products to consumers. And big money is what recruiters often allude to in their pitches.\\" :*\\"Roland Whitsell, a former business professor who spent 40 years researching and teaching the pitfalls of multilevel marketing\\": \\"You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone making over $1.50 an hour, (t)he primary product is opportunity. The strongest, most powerful motivational force today is false hope.\\" *Based on the results of a 2018 poll conducted with 1,049 MLM sellers, the majority (60%) earned an average of less than $100 in sales over a five year period, and 20% never made a single sale. The majority of sellers made less than 70 cents per hour. Nearly 32 percent of those polled acquired credit card debt to finance their MLM involvement. Legality and legitimacy=Bangladesh In 2015, the Government of Bangladesh banned all types of domestic and foreign MLM trade in Bangladesh. China Multi-level marketing () was first introduced to mainland China by American, Taiwanese, and Japanese companies following the Chinese economic reform of 1978. This rise in multi-level marketing's popularity coincided with economic uncertainty and a new shift towards individual consumerism. Multi-level marketing was banned on the mainland by the government in 1998, citing social, economic, and taxation issues. Further regulation \\"Prohibition of Chuanxiao\\" (where MLM is a type of Chuanxiao was enacted in 2005, clause 3 of Chapter 2 of the regulation states having downlines is illegal). O'Regan wrote 'With this regulation China makes clear that while Direct Sales is permitted in the mainland, Multi-Level Marketing is not'. MLM companies have been trying to find ways around China's prohibitions, or have been developing other methods, such as direct sales, to take their products to China through retail operations. The Direct Sales Regulations limit direct selling to cosmetics, health food, sanitary products, bodybuilding equipment and kitchen utensils. And the Regulations require Chinese or foreign companies (\\"FIEs\\") who intend to engage into direct sale business in mainland China to apply for and obtain direct selling license from the Ministry of Commerce (\\"MOFCOM\\"). In 2016, there are 73 companies, including domestic and foreign companies, that have obtained the direct selling license. Some multi-level marketing sellers have circumvented this ban by establishing addresses and bank accounts in Hong Kong, where the practice is legal, while selling and recruiting on the mainland. It was not until August 23, 2005 that the State Council promulgated rules that dealt specifically with direct sale operation- Administration of Direct Sales (entered into effect on 1 December 2005) and the Regulations for the Prohibition of Chuanxiao (entered into effect on 1 November 2005). When direct selling is allowed, it will only be permitted under the most stringent requirements, in order to ensure the operations are not pyramid schemes, MLM, or fly-by-night operations. Saudi Arabia MLM marketing is banned in Saudi Arabia by imposing religious fatwa nationally, for this reason MLM companies like Amway, Mary Kay, Oriflame and Herbalife sell their products by online selling method instead of MLM. United States MLM businesses operate in all 50 U.S. states. Businesses may use terms such as \\"affiliate marketing\\" or \\"home-based business franchising\\". Many pyramid schemes attempt to present themselves as legitimate MLM businesses. Some sources say that all MLMs are essentially pyramid schemes, even if they are legal. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states: \\"Steer clear of multilevel marketing plans that pay commissions for recruiting new distributors. They're actually illegal pyramid schemes. Why is pyramiding dangerous? Because plans that pay commissions for recruiting new distributors inevitably collapse when no new distributors can be recruited. And when a plan collapses, most people—except perhaps those at the very top of the pyramid—end up empty-handed.\\" In a 2004 Staff Advisory letter to the Direct Selling Association, the FTC states: > Much has been made of the personal, or internal, consumption issue in recent > years. In fact, the amount of internal consumption in any multi-level > compensation business does not determine whether or not the FTC will > consider the plan a pyramid scheme. The critical question for the FTC is > whether the revenues that primarily support the commissions paid to all > participants are generated from purchases of goods and services that are not > simply incidental to the purchase of the right to participate in a money- > making venture. The Federal Trade Commission warns \\"Not all multilevel marketing plans are legitimate. Some are pyramid schemes. It's best not to get involved in plans where the money you make is based primarily on the number of distributors you recruit and your sales to them, rather than on your sales to people outside the plan who intend to use the products.\\" The Federal Trade Commission issued a decision, In re Amway Corp., in 1979 in which it indicated that multi-level marketing was not illegal per se in the United States. However, Amway was found guilty of price fixing (by effectively requiring \\"independent\\" distributors to sell at the same fixed price) and making exaggerated income claims. The FTC advises that multi-level marketing organizations with greater incentives for recruitment than product sales are to be viewed skeptically. The FTC also warns that the practice of getting commissions from recruiting new members is outlawed in most states as \\"pyramiding\\". Walter J. Carl stated in a 2004 Western Journal of Communication article that \\"MLM organizations have been described by some as cults (Butterfield, 1985),Stephen Butterfield, Amway, the Cult of Free Enterprise (Boston: South End Press, 1985). pyramid schemes (Fitzpatrick & Reynolds, 1997),; Robert L. FitzPatrick & Joyce K. Reynolds, False Profits: Seeking Financial and Spiritual Deliverance in Multi- Level Marketing and Pyramid Schemes (Herald Pr, 1997). or organizations rife with misleading, deceptive, and unethical behavior (Carter, 1999),Ruth Carter, Amway Motivational Organizations: Behind the Smoke and Mirrors (Winter Park, Fla.: Backstreet Publishing, 1999). such as the questionable use of evangelical discourse to promote the business (Höpfl & Maddrell, 1996),H. Höpfl & J. Maddrell, “Can You Resist a Dream? Evangelical Metaphors and the Appropriation of Emotion”, Metaphor and Organizations, eds. D. Grant & C. Oswick (Thousand Oaks, Cal.: Sage, 1996), 200–12. and the exploitation of personal relationships for financial gain (Fitzpatrick & Reynolds, 1997)\\". In China, volunteers working to rescue people from the schemes have been physically attacked. MLMs are also criticized for being unable to fulfill their promises for the majority of participants due to basic conflicts with Western cultural norms. There are even claims that the success rate for breaking even or even making money are far worse than other types of businesses: \\"The vast majority of MLMs are recruiting MLMs, in which participants must recruit aggressively to profit. Based on available data from the companies themselves, the loss rate for recruiting MLMs is approximately 99.9%; i.e., 99.9% of participants lose money after subtracting all expenses, including purchases from the company.\\" In part, this is because encouraging recruits to further \\"recruit people to compete with [them]\\" leads to \\"market saturation.\\" It has also been claimed \\"(b)y its very nature, MLM is completely devoid of any scientific foundations.\\" Because of the encouraging of recruits to further recruit their competitors, some people have even gone so far as to say at best modern MLMs are nothing more than legalized pyramid schemes with one stating \\"Multi-level marketing companies have become an accepted and legally sanctioned form of pyramid scheme in the United States\\" while another states \\"Multi-Level Marketing, a form of Pyramid Scheme, is not necessarily fraudulent.\\" In October 2010 it was reported that multilevel marketing companies were being investigated by a number of state attorneys general amid allegations that salespeople were primarily paid for recruiting and that more recent recruits cannot earn anything near what early entrants do. Industry critic Robert L. FitzPatrick has called multi-level marketing \\"the Main Street bubble\\" that will eventually burst. Religious views=Islam Many Islamic jurists and religious bodies including Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta of Saudi Arabia have considered MLM trade to be prohibited or haram, the reasons behind which are as follows: In this process, followings are related - exchange without labor and labor without exchange, contract on another contract or condition on another condition, similarity with Riba (interest), similarity with gambling, widespread uncertainty of profits and losses, not everyone benefiting equally, financial fraud and torture, lying and exaggeration, etc. See also *Binary option *Destiny Group *Get-rich-quick scheme *List of multi-level marketing companies *Ponzi scheme *Pyramid scheme *Saradha Group financial scandal *Tiens References  External links  *Federal Trade Commission article Category:Business models Category:Direct marketing Category:Direct selling Category:Types of marketing ","title":"Multi-level marketing"},{"id":"10447184","text":"Donald Brown may refer to: Academics * Donald F.

It was created by Howard L. Chace circa 1940, and he later collected his stories and poems in the book Anguish Languish (Prentice- Hall, 1956).Chace, Howard L. Anguish Languish, Prentice-Hall, 1967. It is not really a language but rather humorous homophonic transformation. Example: \\"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\\" means \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and \\"Mural: Yonder nor sorghum stenches shut ladle gulls stopper torque wet strainers\\" means: Moral: Under no circumstances should little girls stop to talk with strangers. Chace offered this description: \\"The Anguish Languish consists only of the purest of English words, and its chief raison d'être is to demonstrate the marvelous versatility of a language in which almost anything can, if necessary, be made to mean something else.\\" His story \\"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\\" is \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" re-written with similar-sounding words substituting for the original folk tale. A professor of French, Chace wrote \\"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\\" in 1940 to demonstrate that the intonation of spoken English is almost as important to the meaning as the words themselves. It was first published in Gene Sherman's \\"Cityside\\" column in the Los Angeles Times in 1953, reprinted in the San Francisco Chronicle and in the first issue of Sports Illustrated in 1954. Book First edition (publ. Prentice-Hall) After Arthur Godfrey read \\"Ladle Rat Rotten Hut\\" on one of his programs, thousands of requests for copies of the story prompted the publication of Chace's stories and nursery rhymes in Anguish Languish, illustrated with cartoons by Hal Doremus. In the Anguish Languish, a single word replaces several in the correct version (e.g., \\"evanescent\\" from \\"if it isn't\\"), and sometimes several words replace one longer word (\\"on forger nut\\" for \\"unfortunate\\"). Every word can be found in most collegiate dictionaries, with the exception of \\"icer\\" (which is in Merriam-Webster's Unabridged). Although written with a serious purpose in mind, the humorous aspects cannot be ignored, especially with Chace's additions of phrases not in the traditional stories (\\"A nervous sausage bag ice!\\" for \\"I never saw such big eyes!\\") and added plot twists.

Beginning his working life as a mathematically trained civilian instructor for the Royal Navy, he later became Professor of Modern History at King's College London and a co-founder of the Navy Records Society. A prolific writer of lives, he penned the biographies of more than 900 naval personalities for the Dictionary of National Biography.The Dictionary of National Biography 1912–1921 by Oxford pages 324 + 325 Family Laughton was born in Liverpool on 23 April 1830, the second son and youngest child of a former Master Mariner, James Laughton of Liverpool (1777–1859). In 1866, Laughton married his first wife, Isabella, daughter of John Carr of Dunfermline. They had two sons, Leonard and Arthur, and three daughters - Elsbeth, Mary and Dorothy. In 1886, Laughton married his second wife, Maria Josefa, daughter of Eugenio di Alberti, of Cádiz, Spain; they had three sons and two daughters, one of whom was Dame Vera Laughton Mathews. Sir John Knox Laughton died at his home at Wimbledon on 14 September 1915, aged 85. Academic career Laughton was educated at the Royal Institution School, Liverpool, and then at Caius College, Cambridge, graduating BA (34th wrangler) in 1852. He served with the Royal Navy as a civilian shipboard instructor teaching mathematics, science and navigation, and saw combat in the Baltic and Far East campaigns.Adamiak, Stanley J. 'The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession', Review of book by Professor Andrew Lambert, Journal of Military History Vol. 64, No. 4 (October 2000) pp. 1169–1170 In 1866 he finished his sea days by going ashore to teach at the Royal Naval College in Portsmouth. When the College moved to the new Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1873, Laughton moved with it to become Head of the Department of Meteorology and Marine Surveying. In the 1870s Laughton turned more and more to teaching and lecturing on history, delivering a now famous lecture to the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in 1874 on the importance of actually analysing historical events, rather than merely reporting events chronologically. This was a new idea at the time and would not have been seen then as stating the obvious, as perhaps it would today.John Hattendorf, The Caird Lecture, 2000: The Anglo-French Naval Wars (1689–1815) in twentieth century naval thought Journal for Maritime Research. http://www.jmr.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conJmrArticle.30/viewPage/2 – URL last accessed 3 April 2007 With this new approach, Laughton ‘acted as a catalyst for [the] entire intellectual development' of naval history as an independent discipline.Andrew Lambert (1998) The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession (London: Chatham House), p. 11 During his time as a lecturer in naval history, Laughton was undoubtedly an influence on the more famous naval historian-strategists of his age – Alfred Thayer Mahan, Julian Corbett and Herbert Richmond. Mahan, who has been described as \\"one of Laughton's disciples\\", wrote of him that \\"He probably knows more naval history than any English speaking man living\\".R.J.B. Knight (2000) The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession, Review of book by Professor Andrew Lambert in the Institute for Historical Research's Reviews in History series. (London: Institute for Historical Research) http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/paper/knight.html – URL last accessed 3 April 2007 In 1885 he left the Royal Navy to accept the position of Professor of Modern History at King's College, London. He succeeded in convincing the Admiralty to allow limited public access to their archives. Together with Admiral Cyprian Bridge, Laughton co-founded the Navy Records Society in 1893. He was the Society's first Secretary, and was knighted for his work in 1907. Laughton died at the age of 85 on 14 September 1915 and was buried at sea in the Thames Estuary from the decks of . Legacy and influence Laughton's contributions to naval history were largely forgotten until the pioneering work by Canadian naval historian Donald Mackenzie Schurman The Education of a Navy: The Development of British Naval Strategic Thought, 1867–1914 (1965) resurrected his memory. Professor Andrew Lambert has since added to this with a work, The Foundations of Naval History: John Knox Laughton, the Royal Navy and the Historical Profession. Unlike Mahan and Corbett, Laughton never wrote a major work, and the body of work that he did leave behind went out of print and until online editions became available was very difficult to come by. The measure of his significance comes by looking at the people he influenced and the institutions which he left behind after his death. Through 'long-term influence and personal contact' with other thinkers in the field and British admirals, he managed to sow the seeds in influential people’s minds that naval history was a subject worth studying, something which had relevance and bearing on modern naval affairs.Lambert (1998), p. 193 The Navy Records Society remains a key part of the discipline of naval history. In recognition of his importance, King's College Department of War Studies has named its naval history chair as the Laughton Professor, and naval historians in the department belong to the Laughton Unit .http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/research/groups/lnu/index.aspx/ Honours * Knight Bachelor in 1907 * Chesney Gold Medal in 1910 * Professorship, granted in 1885 by King's College London Works * Physical Geography in Its Relation to the Prevailing Winds and Currents (London: Potter, 1873) read online * Recollections of James Anthony Gardner [1770–1846], Commander R.

The sleeves are the most immediately notable difference when comparing the bliaut to other female outer clothing of the Middle Ages. They fit closely from the shoulder to approximately the elbow, and then widen from the elbow to drape to floor- or nearly floor-length. This garment's usage appears to be geographically limited to areas of French influence, with some works depicting the garment or the garment in transition as far away as Rome and modern Germany. Evolution of the bliaut=Women's bliaut Examples of this garment and its evolution appear as early as the Bayeaux Tapestry, wherein a female figure wears a garment which is loose in the body, but has the extended sleeve that would be an identifying characteristic of the style after its transition.Boucher, François. 20,000 Years of Fashion: The History of Costume and Personal Adornment Paintings and illuminated items that depict the item as well include a miniature called Ladder of Virtue dated to the twelfth centuryKlapisch-Zuber, Christiane, editor. A History of Women: Silences of the Middle Ages. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1995 (Original 1990) and the work of Claricia, a nun and illuminator who appears to be wearing one in her small self-portrait in a South German Psalter dated c. 1200, currently in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. Earlier depictions of bliauts appear to be cut in one piece, such as an example at Angers Cathedral, which is cinched at the natural waistline. The statue at Angers also shows visible lacing at the sides. Later examples of statuary such as the jambs of the Cathedral of Chartres west façade portals show the full accomplishment of the bliaut on female saints and patrons, such as the \\"Lady With Embroidered Hem,\\" appearing on the left, beside the left portal.Sullivan, Mary Ann. \\"Images of Chartres Cathedral, Chartres, France -- page 5\\" Bluffton College, Bluffton, OH: Sullivan, Mary Ann. Retrieved 3 April 2007 from the World Wide Web: http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/chartreswest/jambs.html These later bliauts, usually shown on statues carved between the 1130s and 1160s, are termed the bliaut girone, and unlike their predecessors, were cut in two pieces. The bliaut girone consisted of a fitted bodice (cors) and skirt (girone), which was pleated into a low waistband and fell down in vertical folds. It was often paired with a girdle, or ceinture, which was wrapped around the stomach, emphasising the womb. The bliaut girone was frequently worn at court and can be seen on the seals of Eleanor of Aquitaine, Marie of France, Countess of Champagne and Agnes de Champagne. Lanval, an 1160s poem by Marie de France, makes reference to 'tightly laced dresses of dark purple'. Men's bliaut The men's bliaut was more loosely fitted than the women's, and was cut in one piece with a flared skirt. Gores were inserted into the skirt to produce vertical folds. Materials The fabrics available in this time would have been limited to woolens, linens, and silks. A fine wool or silk seems to be the best option, as linen is rather more difficult to dye a permanent color, and colored depictions of this item show a great deal of color.Duby, Georges. France in the Middle Ages 987 - 1460. Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishers, Inc., 2000 (Original French 1987) Construction The historic costuming community remains divided over the method by which the abdominal folds are achieved. Theories range from cut to lacing to fabric manipulation methods. # Patterning an extended torso from underbust to waist or just above the hip, which when worn would achieve a number of wrinkles in the area. # Patterning for a tight abdomen. A garment sewn to fit tightly across the abdomen creates horizontal wrinkles due to tension. # Cutting a rather narrow abdomen and lacing the sides of the garment to create tensioned horizontal wrinkling. # What is modernly termed lattice or \\"honeycomb\\" smocking, which is a form of gathered fabric manipulation executed on the underside/interior. # Narrow pleats created by the plissé technique-gathering fabric with stitches, wetting the fabric, and \\"setting\\" the pleats by allowing the wet fabric to dry under weight or tension-were found on linen chemises or smocks in the 10th century Viking graves in Birka.Owen-Crocker, Gale R., Dress in Anglo-Saxon England, revised edition, Boydell Press, 2004, , pp. 42, 218 The achievement of skirt volume is also debated, ranging from a hipline seam with attached wide skirt to the addition of gores/godets to expand the hemline.

It was the first album credited solely to Hornsby, without his previous backing band, the Range. The record showcased Hornsby in a more jazz-oriented setting and featured an all-star lineup, including Pat Metheny, Branford Marsalis, Jerry Garcia, Phil Collins and Bonnie Raitt. Unlike earlier albums, Harbor Lights allowed more space for Hornsby's and guest-players' \\"extended instrumental\\" solos to \\"flow naturally\\" out of the songs. The tone was set by the opening title track, which after 50 seconds of expansive solo piano lurches into an up-tempo jazz number, ending with Metheny's guitar runs. The album closes in a similar fashion with \\"Pastures of Plenty\\", this time with an extended guitar solo from Garcia intertwined with Hornsby's piano. Hornsby also quotes the main musical phrase from the Grateful Dead's \\"Dark Star\\" as the jazz head to his song about tensions surrounding a biracial relationship, \\"Talk of the Town\\". The mid-tempo \\"Fields of Gray\\", written for Hornsby's recently born twin sons, received some modest radio airplay, peaking at #69 on the Billboard Hot 100. Harbor Lights was well received by critics and fans, who praised it for its \\"cooler, jazzier sound\\" and its \\"affinity for sincere portraits of American life, love, and heartache.\\" The album cover uses Edward Hopper's 1951 painting Rooms By the Sea.

The halt was situated ¾ mile south of Broadstone, 1½ miles from Poole town centre and 116 miles 79 chains from London Waterloo. The original line had been opened on 2 December 1872 by the L&SWR;, and had closed completely by 2 May 1977; the halt itself opened on 19 June 1933 and closed on 7 March 1966. Construction Consisting of two platforms prefabricated in concrete at the railway's own concrete works near Exmouth Junction, the station inherited a pre-cast concrete footbridge from somewhere else. A glazed waiting shelter was situated on each platform, as were enamel running in boards and several totems. One such totem reached £890 in auction in 2007, and a corroded running in board has also been very highly valued. Two window frames, totems and the nearby wooden, crossing keepers' box was preserved by the Creekmoor Light Railway in 1969 at their narrow gauge line 200 yards down the nearby lane. To the front of the down platform (from Bournemouth West) lay a siding serving Sykes Pottery. The ground frame was taken out of use in June 1969 and the track was removed on 18 October 1970. A siding on the other line served the Ministry of Supply's Munitions Factory from 13 September 1940 until the facility was taken out of use in July 1959. The site today The site today lies under the route of the A349 Broadstone Way. The construction of this road means there is now no sign that the halt ever existed.

It operated from 1925 through 1942, when it was closed temporarily due to wartime meat shortages. It never reopened. Early years Founders Charles and Muriel Gay were Anglo-French circus performers who arrived in Los Angeles in 1914. They established an attraction in MacArthur Park (then known as Westlake Park) where the public could watch Charles Gay working with three adult lions. The lions were trained as animal actors in the burgeoning motion picture industry. Needing more room for their animals, the Gays found a large plot of un-zoned property in El Monte, east of Los Angeles, where in 1925 they opened Gay's Lion Farm, a public attraction dedicated to the breeding, training and exhibition of African lions. The Farm quickly became one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Southland, doing a brisk trade in souvenir photographic postcards. Among the famous animals raised on the Farm were Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studio lions Slats (1924–1927, died of appendicitis and was stuffed) and his lookalike successor Jackie, and the celebrated comic lion Numa (1912–1930, died of cancer and was stuffed), named for the lion in the Tarzan books and a co-star in Charlie Chaplin's \\"The Circus\\" (1928). The farm with its thatched roof, African- inspired architecture (a likely inspiration for Walt Disney's Adventureland), was a U-shaped compound, with separate cages for each adult cat, a nursery, and a central caged arena where Charles Gay, with whip and gun, performed a classic lion tamer act for the crowds. Feedings were also a big draw, with a ton of meat being consumed daily. In 1925, El Monte High School adopted the Lions name for its teams, and the Gays provided a lion mascot for big games. Visitors Starting in 1927, the Farm hosted organized visits from men's clubs, such as the Lions Club and the Adventurers Club. These events centered on outdoor banquets set in a clearing among the animal cages, at which guests were served small samples of barbecued lion meat in addition to steak and chicken. An honored guest at these meals, toasted and encouraged to walk the length of the table, was Numa the lion.Los Angeles Times When Greta Garbo first came to Hollywood in 1926, she didn't speak much English. Publicist Don Gillum arranged a publicity stunt at the Farm where the actress was to be photographed cuddling lion cubs, and in a stunt cage so it looked like she was sitting with Numa. Although Gillum told her what she would be doing, Garbo didn't recognize the word lion, and so didn't realize what was in store for her until she was almost in the cage, at which point she shrieked \\"Oh! Dos terrible animals!\\" But she was a good sport and posed for the pictures. Other well-known visitors included Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt and Marie Dressler. Lions escape In September 1928, while the Gays were traveling in Europe, a trainer failed to close a runway while lions, Ike and Short-Tail were being moved between cages. The Lion made a dash for freedom, and slashed the arm of farm manager John Rounan at the moment Rounan fired a shot at the animal; the wound required 100 stitches, and Rounan later died. Trainer Joe Hoffman took off after the lion and felled him with a bullet in the brain. Short-Tail walked into an open cage, and Hoffman was able to lock him in. But Ike got shot in the leg and ran around the farm in a rage, menacing a cow, a cage full of baby lions and arriving police officers. Ike finally died in a hail of bullets from many guns. This incident provided inspiration for hard- boiled author James M. Cain's short story \\"The Baby in the Icebox,\\" which in turn inspired his celebrated novel The Postman Always Rings Twice. The late years At its high point, there were more than 200 adult lions living at the Farm. The farm closed in December 1942, when wartime rationing made it impossible to get the ton of horse meat required daily for the cats, and the lions were loaned to zoos around the country. But by the time the war ended, Charles Gay was too ill to reclaim his cats. He retired to Balboa Island, where he died in 1950. He is buried at San Gabriel Cemetery. The site of the Farm is now an overpass of Interstate 10, the location distinguished by a life-sized bronze statue of a male lion behind a chain link fence beside the sidewalk. A larger lion statue, which commissioned for the Farm, stands in front of nearby El Monte High School.

Belgrade, the capital of Serbia currently consists of 17 municipalities, 10 urban and 7 suburban, but after World War II, over 30 more municipalities were created, abolished and merged with each other. Metropolitan area of the City of Belgrade (click to enlarge)  Territorial changes  It took 27 years (from 1944 to 1971) to territorially shape the modern metropolitan area of the City of Belgrade. Even after 1971 some changes occurred, but due to the internal reorganization, leaving the outer borders of the area intact. Certain ideas of the enlarging further the metropolitan area appeared in the early 1990s but were not realized (see \\"Further expansion\\" below). Some of the most important changes include: * after 1944 - Belgrade consisted of the City of Belgrade, which covered the urban area (divided into raions), and the Zemun and Vračar districts (srez), which covered the suburban areas. As the city expanded, almost entire area of the Vračar District today also makes urban section. * 1952 - Raions were abolished and the urban section was divided into municipalities. * 1955 - City of Belgrade and parts of the Zemun, Vračar and Podunavlje districts merged into the new, Belgrade District. At this point, the area was enlarged to 2,090 km², followed by the creation of many new urban municipalities. * 1957 - New reorganization of the municipalities which reduced their number by merger. * 1960 - Another reorganization and abolition of some municipalities (including Rakovica which was annexed to Čukarica). Metropolitan area enlarged as many municipalities from the bordering districts were annexed to the Belgrade's municipalities. * 1965 - Abolition of the municipalities of Surčin (annexed to Zemun) and Krnjača (annexed to Palilula), reducing number of municipalities to 13: Barajevo, Čukarica, Grocka, Novi Beograd, Obrenovac, Palilula, Savski Venac, Sopot, Stari Grad, Voždovac, Vračar, Zemun and Zvezdara. * 1971 - Fourteenth and fifteenth municipalities, Lazarevac and Mladenovac, annexed to the City of Belgrade, shaping its present territory (3,222 km²). * 1974 - Sixteenth municipality, Rakovica, split from Čukarica. * 2003 - Seventeenth municipality, Surčin, split from Zemun.

Population: 4,642 in 1953. * Železnik - now part of the municipality of Čukarica (see Posavski Venac below). Population: 6,758 in 1953.  Proposed municipalities  With successful 2000-2002 campaigning for Surčin's split from the municipality of Zemun (proclaimed separate municipality on 24 November 2003, separate administration from November 3, 2004), several other motions for the creation of new municipalities appeared. Acting mayor of Belgrade Zoran Alimpić stated in November 2007 that probably no new municipalities will be created before 2011 or 2012.Politika, November 4, 2007, p.23 As of October 2017 none have been created. * Avalski Venac - a movement originated from 1996. A motion for the re-creation of the municipality of Ripanj appeared in 2002. It sought the split from the municipality of Voždovac of its distant, suburban settlements in the area of the Avala mountain: Ripanj, Beli Potok, Pinosava and Zuce. Later, a motion for Vrčin's split from the municipality of Grocka and creation of a joint sub-Avalan municipality also appeared, but wasn't that much vocal. If created, the new municipality would have a population of 28,949 (2011). In September 2007 an official motion was started by the municipality of Voždovac to create this new municipality, which would also include Resnik from the municipality of Rakovica which would raise population to 52,332.Politika, 20 October 2007, p.27Politika, 29 October 2007, p.27 It was supported by the local administration headed by the Democratic Party at the time, but not by the members of the same party on the city level. It was also proposed by the political party G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015. * Batajnica - a movement was very active in 2002, when Surčin also campaigned, but wasn't that much in the public media. Proposed municipality of Batajnica would split from the municipality of Zemun and comprise Batajnica and Ugrinovci (with Busije and Grmovac), with a population of 43,660 in 2011. The notion was supported by G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015. * Bežanijska Kosa - separation from the municipality of New Belgrade, which is considered too large anyway. Combined population of Bežanijska Kosa, Bežanija and Ledine is 45,017 (2011). Also proposed by G17 Plus in 2010. * Dobanovci - a motion for splitting from Zemun ceased when Surčin split from Zemun in 2003. * Dunavski Venac - the most vocal of all movements, asking for the area on the left bank of the Danube to split from the municipality of Palilula and basically re-create the municipality of Krnjača (under the new name), abolished in 1965. In 2003 a petition signed by 17,000 inhabitants from the area was handed to the Belgrade City Assembly which, at the time, judged that conditions for creation of new municipality were not fulfilled. The movement continued gaining a momentum until in 2005 Municipal assembly of Palilula finally accepted to support the move but later decided the opposite so the organization of the establishment of the municipality of Dunavski Venac announced it will sue the municipality of Palilula. The proposed new municipality, if accepted and confirmed by the Belgrade City assembly, would have an area of 407 km² and a population of 86,841 (2011). Supported by G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015. * Kaluđerica - distant from its municipal seat Grocka, and with the population of 26,904 in 2011 three times larger, Kaluđerica makes one urban area with Belgrade. In 2010 G17 Plus proposed new municipality of Kaluđerica, which would also contain Leštane. In 2015, Nova Stranka proposed the detachment of Kaluđerica into separate municipality. * Mirijevo - a movement which gained momentum during the ongoing protest from the local population against construction of the power transformer in the center of the neighborhood. Municipality, which would have a population of 41,407 (2011 Census), and comprise the neighborhood of Mirijevo, should split from the municipality of Zvezdara. However, the idea is on hiatus at the moment. * New Belgrade I and New Belgrade II - proposed division of New Belgrade in two municipalities. Proposed by G17 Plus in 2010. * Posavski Venac - a movement began in 2006 for separation from the municipality of Čukarica. Basically, it soughts the re- creation of the former Umka municipality (that is, section that belongs to Čukarica). It should consist of Železnik, Rušanj, Sremčica, Umka, Velika Moštanica, Pećani, Rucka, Ostružnica and Makiš, with a population of 61,590 in 2011. Also proposed by G17 Plus in 2010. * Sremčica - to split from the municipality of Čukarica, if not as a part of the Posavski Venac. It has a population of 21,001 in 2011. * Vinča - a motion, as a result of big economic and demographic discrepancy between the western and eastern parts of the municipality of Grocka, mentions Vinča as the possible seat of the future municipality formed from the western part of the municipality of Grocka, comprising also Kaluđerica, Boleč, Leštane, and Ritopek, with a population of 53,179 in 2011. * Žarkovo - proposed by Nova Stranka in 2015 to split from Čukarica. * Železnik - proposed by Nova Stranka in 2015. Apart from the neighborhood of Železnik, it was to include all separate settlements in the municipality of Čukarica, making it equal to the proposed Posavski Venac municipality.  Future changes  * Čenta - the village in the Vojvodina's municipality of Zrenjanin (population of 3,050 in 2011) is located on the northern border of the municipality of Palilula. Now and then, motions by the locals, not very vocal though, appear, asking for Čenta to be annexed to the City of Belgrade. Majority of population work on the territory of Belgrade and one regular bus line of the Belgrade City public transportation is connecting Čenta to Belgrade. * Opovo - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 10,440 in 2011, considered by the state government for the incorporation into the City of Belgrade in 1992. * Pančevo - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 123,414 in 2011, considered by the state government for the incorporation into the City of Belgrade in 1992. Though a city and large industrial center of its own (76,203 inhabitants in 2011), Pančevo already functions as de facto Belgrade's suburb: only 16 kilometer away from Belgrade, many people from Pančevo work in Belgrade with a very dense commuting, including a railway line \\"Beovoz\\" (Belgrade train) which connects the two cities, and two cities also make an almost continuous built-up area as the Belgrade spawned along the road which connects them (the industrial zone of the Belgrade's neighborhood of Krnjača). During the 1929-1941 period in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Pančevo, together with Belgrade and Zemun formed the Area of the City of Belgrade, official administrative entity within the kingdom. In 1957 idea of establishing trolleybus line Pančevo-Belgrade appeared in connection with future development of Pančevo industrial zone, but was dropped later.Politika, 1 November 2007, p.27 (reprint from 1957 edition) * Stara Pazova - the municipality in Vojvodina with a population of 65,792 in 2011, it was one of the fastest growing in the province. Not officially considered for incorporation into the Belgrade, being on the outskirts of the city's metropolitan area, just like Pančevo, gravitates toward Belgrade. A commuter railway line \\"Beovoz\\" connects Stara Pazova, Belgrade and Pančevo and some of the largest settlements in the municipality, like Nova Pazova or Novi Banovci, almost make one continuous built-up area with the Belgrade's extreme north-western extension of Batajnica in the municipality of Zemun. Expansion of the metropolitan area of Belgrade was actual in the 1991-1992 when a new territorial reorganization was prepared for the entire Serbia. The government of Radoman Božović proposed the detachment of the municipality of Mladenovac, for example, but also the incorporation of the municipalities of the province of Vojvodina (Opovo and Pančevo) into Belgrade. A new map, with such borders was even printed in the daily newspaper of Večernje novosti at the time, but in the end the borders remained unchanged. In an interview in April 2008, regarding the upcoming general elections, jointly with the local and provincial as well, former mayor of Belgrade in 2000-2001 period, Milan St. Protić stated that rural municipalities (like Obrenovac and Mladenovac) should be detached from Belgrade as they can't funcion efficiently as part of urban agglomeration.Politika, 20 April 2008, p.14 In 2010, political party G17 Plus, which was part of the ruling coalition in the city, proposed a new division with 24 municipalities. New proposed 7 municipalities were Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Bežanijska Kosa, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica (including Leštane), New Belgrade I and II (division of present municipality in two) and Posavski Venac. \\"Nova stranka\\", a political party formed by the former prime minister Zoran Živković, proposed a new administrative division in the late 2015, which was to exclude the municipalities of Lazarevac, Obrenovac and Mladenovac from the City of Belgrade, and creation of new urban municipalities: Avalski Venac, Batajnica, Dunavski Venac, Kaluđerica, Žarkovo and Železnik. After the change in city government in 2014, a commission for the change of the City Statute was formed. It was announced in 2015 and 2016 that the new statute will also deal with the administrative division, return of the division of the municipalities within the city on urban and suburban, change in the municipal jurisdiction, etc., but as of October 2017 nothing changed. In October 2017, Belgrade's Administrative secretariat disclosed that the notions for Dunavski Venac, Avalski Venac and Kaluđerica were applied, but that all three were in a discord with the City Statute.

History=Early years Wisma46, BNI Headquarter in Jakarta Bank Negara Indonesia was established on 5 July 1946. It was prepared to be the Central Bank of Indonesia with the task of issuing and handling Indonesian currency. A few months after its establishment, Bank Negara Indonesia officially distributed the first official currency of Indonesia - ORI or Oeang Republik Indonesia.Bank Negara Indonesia: Company Profile Following the appointment of De Javasche Bank as the Central Bank of Indonesia, Bank Negara Indonesia had its role shifted to that of a development bank, and was later given the right to serve as a foreign exchange bank. Following increased capitalization in 1955, the legal status of Bank Negara Indonesia was changed into that of a commercial bank through a jurisdicial assignment under Emergency Law number 2 of the year 1955. Also in 1955, Bank Negara Indonesia officially opened its first foreign branch in Singapore. Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 After a merger period with several other commercial banks, the function and individuality of the Bank were restored in 1968. The status was resumed to that of a state-run commercial bank. The official name was changed to 'Bank Negara Indonesia 1946'. Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 conducted an operational restructuring program, by formulating the 'Performance Improvement Program' to facilitate a more dynamic role in facing the continuously-changing environment. The program covered various aspects, including the improvement of the Corporate Vision and Mission, the refinement of strategic plans, as well as the development of technology and human resources. Bank Negara Indonesia Former Bank Negara Indonesia logo from 1988 to 2004 Signifying the determination of Bank Negara Indonesia 1946 to create a new image and attitudes in line with its aspiration to play a more international role and to respond to the challenges of globalization, the Bank changed its corporate logo into a 'Sailing Boat' and introduced the nickname of 'Bank BNI'. The law number 7 of the year 1992 opened-up opportunities for state-run banks to change their legal status into Limited State-Owned Corporations (or Persero). With this change in legal status, the Bank's name was officially replaced with 'PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero)'. In 1996, Bank Negara Indonesia's decision to become a public company was manifested through an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares through the stock exchange. Bank Negara Indonesia was the first government bank in Indonesia which listed its shares on both the Jakarta Stock Exchange (now Indonesia Stock Exchange) and the Surabaya Stock Exchange. The corporate name was amended to 'PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk', to show its status as a public company. The government's banking recapitalization program, launched after the economic crisis, provided Bank Negara Indonesia with additional capital of IDR 61,2 trillion.

Stellmach (on left); 1959 Biography Stelmach was born in Petah Tikva, British Mandate of Palestine (now Israel), to a Jewish family. He was chosen third by Yediot Aharonot's greatest Israeli footballers. He made a name for himself as the leader of Hapoel Petah Tikva. At the height of his career in Hapoel Petah Tikva, Stelmach received offers to sign for Arsenal and Fenerbahçe but declined due to his loyalty to the team. He led his team to five national championships, four of them consecutive. His most recognizable attribute was the quality of his headers, with which he scored most of his international goals. As a result, he was commonly nicknamed \\"the golden head\\" in Israel. He scored what was arguably his most famous goal for the Israeli national football team in an Olympic qualifier against The USSR, with Lev Yashin as goalkeeper at the Ramat Gan Stadium on 1956. Despite the fact that Israel lost the game 2:1 (his goal was a temporary equalizer), and that the game was not televised, that goal is widely considered a defining moment in the history of Israel's national team's early years. Coach He was the trainer of Hapoel Haifa in the 1970s, while training the international stars Yochanan Vollach and Itzhak Englander.

Walking, for example, involves shifting of the body's weight from one foot to another, so freeing the first so that it may be lifted and moved forward. This process is a 'natural' movement in humans and other animals, but is in effect a complex process of biomechanics. In the full weight transfer, the center of gravity becomes vertically projected onto another body part (e.g., foot) freeing the first one so that it may be freely lifted or moved. (In fact, lifting the foot off the ground is a simple test often suggested for the beginners to ensure that they have completed the practiced dance move and their weight is on the proper foot.) In partial weight transfer the center of gravity is shifted to project between the old and new support body part. In some dance moves, such as ball change, the force produced by pushing with the new supporting foot at the moment of the partial weight transfer makes it possible to lift the previous support foot for a short time, followed by the drop back onto the first supporting foot subject to the gravity force. Partner dancing Control of weight transfers is an important part of the partner dance technique. In general, important components of foot action during a dance step are foot movement, foot placement, and weight transfer. Weight transfers of the leader are important cues in leading and following.

Designed by leading Cincinnati architect Samuel Hannaford and completed in 1880, it was the home of the first German Methodist church to be established anywhere in the world,Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 600-601. and it was declared a historic site in the late twentieth century. Organic history Sanctuary Born in 1807 in the city of Stuttgart in Germany, William Nast immigrated to the United States at the age of . After teaching at the United States Military Academy and at Kenyon College, he joined the Methodist Episcopal Church at the age of and was soon ordained to the Methodist ministry. Starting in Cincinnati in 1837, he began a process of organizing Methodist churches among German immigrants throughout the United States. Although the members of the new First German Methodist Episcopal Church originally worshipped in the nearby Wesley Chapel, they soon acquired the Race Street property on which the present church building is located. Eventually named Nast Methodist Church for its founder, the congregation merged with Trinity Methodist Church in 1958, and the two churches' names were mingled. Trinity Methodist was older than Nast Methodist, having been established in 1835.OTR church celebrates 175 years in the community, WCPO, 2010-08-29. Accessed 2010-11-17. Its founding members had come together from several older Methodist Episcopal churches in various parts of the city, including Wesley Chapel; because the denomination lacked churches in the city's downtown, a lot was purchased on Ninth Street and the Trinity congregation's building erected there. Over the years, Trinity was weakened multiple times by the establishment of several other congregations by some of its former members; more than half of its members left to found Walnut Hills Methodist Church in 1870, and the 1892 creation of Clifton Methodist Episcopal Church resulted in the departure of three-fourths of Trinity's leading members. By the middle of the twentieth century, the neighborhood surrounding Trinity's church building had become part of Cincinnati's central business district, and the congregation was continuing to shrink in both membership and money; as a result, it merged with Nast Methodist Church.Church History, Nast Trinity United Methodist Church, 2009.

Accessed 2010-11-17. Two-and-a-half stories tall, the church features a prominent front gable with a grand tympanum created in the Norman style. Numerous courses of undressed stone appear on the exterior, which is furthermore distinguished by a semi-Palladian window, an elaborate Romanesque Revival arch, multiple small circular windows, and small porches on both sides of the facade. By choosing Samuel Hannaford (who was a member of the Winton Place Methodist Episcopal Church in the village of Winton PlaceOwen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 691.) to design their new structure in 1881, Nast Methodist Episcopal Church selected one of Cincinnati's most prominent architects. Having completed the grand Cincinnati Music Hall in the 1870s, Hannaford was at the pinnacle of his career in the early 1880s. At this time, Cincinnati was experiencing significant growth, and Hannaford's services were in demand throughout the city and its suburbs.Gordon, Stephen C., and Elisabeth H. Tuttle. '. National Park Service, 1978-12-11. Accessed 2010-11-17. Many other churches in the region commissioned buildings from Hannaford during this period of his life; more than a dozen survive today, and nearly all of these structures feature walls of ashlar with undressed exteriors, like that of Nast Trinity. Conversely, few of these church buildings are designed in the conventional Romanesque Revival style of Nast Trinity; the majority are Gothic Revival buildings, and several others are examples of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Such a variation in styles was not restricted to religious buildings; as popular tastes changed, Hannaford willingly employed a wide range of architectural styles in all types of buildings. Historic site In recognition of its historically significant architecture, the National Park Service listed the former First German Methodist Episcopal Church on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was part of a multiple property submission of structures designed by Samuel Hannaford in Cincinnati and the surrounding metropolitan area, which included thirteen different religious buildings and more than fifty buildings overall. Its designation as a historic site is particularly significant because of its religious nature, for churches and other religious properties are not typically considered eligible for inclusion on the Register.National Register Criteria for Evaluation, National Park Service.

It was founded and edited by Sebastian Chan, with current editors Bob Baker Fish, Chris Downton and Peter Hollo. It covers independent electronic music, avant- rock, experimental sound art and left field hip hop. History and profile The magazine started as a photocopied zine in 1998, as an offshoot of the weekly Sydney club night Frigid, run by Chan and co-editor/designer Dale Harrison. Chan and Harrison had met at university and edited the university newspaper together. Harrison, now the bass player for Sydney band The Herd, resigned after Issue 12 (October 2005) and was replaced by designer Bim Ricketson. Matthew Levinson joined Chan as editor. Each issue featured local and international music feature articles. Until Issue 16, comprehensive reviews covering CDs, DVDs and vinyl were also found in the print version of the magazine. After this issue, these continued on the website. The magazine also had a record sleeve design reviews section and a guest cover designer. Past cover designers include Rinzen, Bim Ricketson and Build. The magazine also incorporated a music listening club where CDs were posted to subscribers. The magazine was published three times a year with a print run of 5000. It was available free in selected record stores and other outlets across Australia distributed by Inertia Distribution. The website contains an archive of the issues in PDF format. In 2003, Cyclic Defrost, the Australian youth media art festival's noise project and SBS Radio's Alchemy program worked together on a project called Sonic Allsorts which featured non-English speaking music artists. A CD was produced and distributed in the magazine, and the artists were played on SBS Radio. The National Library of Australia's Pandora Archive project has preserved the Cyclic Defrost website since 2004. In 2005, the Australian Council for the Arts and Austrade assisted Cyclic Defrost to attend Sónar electronic music festival in Barcelona. A special sampler CD of music from Australian electronic music artists and producers, as well as the magazine itself, were distributed at the conference to help introduce Australian music and publications to overseas audiences. Cyclic Defrost was chosen as a case study for the Australia Council for the Arts' Fuel 4 Arts' Protein project in 2005 based on it receiving a 'New Audiences' grant in 2002. Anna Poletti, in her book Intimate Ephemera: Reading Young Lives in Australian Zine Culture listed Cyclic Defrost as an example of Australian DIY culture, describing it as, > Contemporary Australian DIY culture has an equally strong interest in skill- > sharing and development, non-commercial modes of circulation and > distribution, and practices of craft and thrift as sources of pleasure and > community-building which seek no greater effect than their own existence. Sound and media artist Shannon O'Neill, writing for RealTime Arts, called the magazine, a key participant in Australian music discourse. In June 2013, after 47 issues, the final print issue was published. The online version remains in publication. Following Cyclic Defrost's transition to a digital-only magazine in July 2013, Bob Baker Fish, Chris Downton and Peter Hollo assumed editorial duties for the website.

The contribution of goods and services to Australia's current account (in $Millions) since 1959. In trade terms, the Australian economy has had persistently large current account deficits for more than 50 years.Downwonder Economist.com, 29 March 2007 One single factor that undermines balance of payments is Australia's narrow export base. Dependent upon commodities, the Australian government has endeavoured to redevelop the Australian manufacturing sector. This initiative, also known as microeconomic reform, has helped Australian manufacturing to grow from 10.1% in 1983–1984 to 17.8% in 2003–2004.Leading Edge, R: \\"Australia in the Global Economy\\", Tim Dixon and John O'Mahomy, page 133 There are other factors that have contributed to the extremely high current account deficit that Australia has today. Lack of international competitiveness and heavy reliance on capital goods from overseas might increase Australia's current account deficit in the future. Low levels of national savings also contribute to high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by borrowing from the domestic sector. Economists refer to the 'crowding out effect' to explain this economic situation. When governments borrow from the domestic sector, they force the private sector to 'crowd out'. Since there aren't enough funds available within the domestic economy, the private sector is forced to borrow funds from overseas. The borrowing of funds is simply typed into the borrowers account at interest to the lender and the fractional reserve banking system kicks in via computerised lendings. Borrowing from overseas causes Australia's current account deficit to increase, leading to a major increase in credit debt expansion. On the other hand, there is nothing wrong with the debt growing if Gross Domestic Product grows at the same time. That is, current account deficit has to stay within a range of 4–5% in order to meet regular interest repayments on foreign debt whilst maintaining perpetual servitude of the borrower and interest repayments to the lender. However, excessive current account deficit, combined with low investor confidence and the possibility of a currency crisis, may force the central bank to implement contractionary macroeconomic policies to restrict economic growth. When economic growth or activity is being restricted, low investment and low levels of expenditure will generally restrain the current account from growing. Nevertheless, Australia's current account deficit needs a long-term solution in order to secure the Australian economy's viability. Many economists , notably John Pitchford, argued that choices whether to borrow or lend are dealt with between private or 'consenting adults' and in consequence no governmental intervention is necessary. There are also other experts who argue that Australia's high current account deficit will undermine the Australian dollar and that it might experience a similar crisis experienced by the Thai currency that foreshadowed major economic crisis.  Effects on wider economy  There are multiple complications that result if countries have a high sustained current account deficit and high foreign debt. While sustainable foreign debt is not a major problem, an unsustainable current account deficit can have serious repercussions for the Australian economy. In December 2007, Australia's deficit hit $23.3 billion which was an 18 per cent increase from three months earlier.Record deficit blow-out 5 March 2008  See also  * Ausbuy * Balance of payments * Economy of Australia * Fractional Reserve Banking * Products manufactured in Australia  References  External links  * Balance of Payments and International Investment Position, Australia, Mar 2015, Australian Bureau of Statistics Category:Economy of Australia Australia Category:International finance ","title":"Balance of payments of Australia"},{"id":"10447743","text":"Abgent is a global biotechnology company based in San Diego, California, US with offices in Maidenhead, UK and Suzhou, China and distributors around the world.

Tools=SUMOplot Analysis Program SUMOplot is a tool used to predict sumoylation sites, an important post-translational modification of proteins. SUMO-modified proteins contain the tetrapeptide motif B-K-x-D/E where B is a hydrophobic residue, K is the lysine conjugated to SUMO, x is any amino acid (aa), D or E is an acidic residue. Substrate specificity appears to be derived directly from Ubc9 and the respective substrate motif. SUMOplot predicts the probability for the SUMO consensus sequence (SUMO-CS) to be engaged in SUMO attachment. The SUMOplot score system is based on two criteria: first, direct amino acid match to the SUMO-CS observed and shown to bind Ubc9, and second, substitution of the consensus amino acid residues with amino acid residues exhibiting similar hydrophobicity. SUMOplot has been used in the past to predict Ubc9 dependent sites.Gramatikoff K. et al.

Known autophagy receptors are characterized by short linear sequence motifs (autophagy receptor motifs, or ARMs) responsible for the interaction with the Atg8/LC3 family. Many ARM-containing proteins (ARM-CPs) are also involved in autophagosome formation and maturation and a few of them in regulating signaling pathways. Autophagy Receptor Motif Plotter assists in the identification of novel ARM-CPs. Users input a given an amino acid sequence into the web-enabled tool, and the program identifies internal sequences matching a pattern within the 3 classes of the extended ARM motif (x6-W/F/Yxxx-x2). The program then computes and lists the top four scores for each motif class (W-, F-, Y-). The full sequence of the ARM-CP is displayed, where ARMs are colored by their score and ranked score-values are presented in tabular form.Noda et al (2010) FEBS Letters 584: 1379-85 Birgisdottir et al (2013) J Cell Sci 126: 3237-47 Rogov et al (2014) Molecular Cell 53: 167-78 See also * Antibodies * Autophagy database * Neurodegenerative disorders * Stem cell marker * SUMO protein ReferencesExternal links *Abgent Official Website * Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States Category:Companies based in San Diego Category:Biotechnology companies established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in California Category:Biotechnology companies disestablished in 2010 Category:2010 disestablishments in California ","title":"Abgent"},{"id":"10447764","text":"The de Havilland Gipsy Six is a British six-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted inline piston engine developed for aircraft use in the 1930s. It was based on the cylinders of the four-cylinder Gipsy Major and went on to spawn a whole series of similar aero engines that were still in common use until the 1980s. The engines were of particular note for their exceptionally low cross- sectional area, a drag-reducing feature which made them ideal for the many racing aircraft of that period. In 1934, the basic bronze-headed Gipsy Six, rated at 185 horsepower (138 kW) at 2,100 rpm was modified for use in the DH.88 Comet air racer as the Gipsy Six \\"R\\" which produced 223 horsepower (166 kW) at 2,400 rpm for takeoff. Many Gipsy Six engines remain in service powering vintage aircraft types today. Design and development The de Havilland company had hoped to produce a version of the basic engine capable of utilising a hydraulically actuated variable-pitch (VP) airscrew based on the American Hamilton \\"Bracket-Type\\" in time for the 1934 MacRobertson Race. Since there was so little time to perfect this installation, as a compromise, a French \\"Ratier\\" VP airscrew was fitted to the Comets' \\"R\\" engines, which utilised a simple air-filled bladder for a once-per-flight automatic pitch change. Later on, Comets were fitted with the Series II engine, which eliminated this crude system. Power for the \\"R\\" was increased to a takeoff rating of by increasing the compression ratios from 5.25:1 to 6.5:1, while fitting aluminium alloy cylinder heads, domed-pistons and modified valve gear. Production of the basic fixed-pitch Gipsy Six unit began in 1935, with the engines rated at at 2,400 rpm for takeoff. This was quickly followed by production of the Gipsy Six Series II for use with the hydraulically actuated airscrews that de Havilland were by then producing under a licence acquired from Hamilton Standard in 1934. This was effectively the engine that the company did not have time to develop for the 1934 MacRobertson race, but without the significant increase in compression-ratio needed for the Comet. The Series II unit, while superficially similar to its predecessor, utilised a hollow, splined crankshaft to permit the fitting of the VP airscrew utilising boosted pressurised oil from the engine's dry-sump lubrication system via a pilot-operated control valve. As well as differences to the crankcase and crankshaft, different cylinder barrels, pistons and aluminium cylinder heads were utilised. There was also an added, very limited ability provided on the Series II to run accessories. The \\"pilot-friendly\\" constant speed units (CSUs) were not available for these engines until 1939. The Series II was also equipped with AMC (Automatic Mixture Control) a barometric device, without which it was exceedingly difficult to adjust for a correct mixture with a CSU fitted. This feature was also carried over onto the similar Queen II. Pilots were then able to simply select the required RPM and Boost pressure required. This reduction in over-leaning also tended to extend the TBO (time between overhauls). The twin down-draught, Claudel-Hobson A.I.48 carburetters were common to all these engines. The induction system was designed to automatically obviate the effects of carburetter icing - a dangerous problem that still plagues most piston engines in current worldwide use in 2008, more than 70 years later. Alfa Romeo built two engine types based on the Gipsy Six design, the Alfa Romeo 110 and Alfa Romeo 115. Type history The series of engines proved to be reliable, and the time between overhaul (TBO) was more than doubled within a few years. The Achilles' heel of the earlier units, namely the lack of facilities for running ancillary items, an increasing requirement during the 1930s, was addressed later on the Queen engines. These engines powered many, if not most of the racing and record-setting aircraft of the 1930s. The engines were subsequently developed into the similar de Havilland Gipsy Queen III and Queen II for military applications. Later developments, such as the postwar Queen 30 and Queen 70 series engines took the rated power from up to nearly , and, while being entirely new designs, still used all of the same basic configuration of the original Gipsy Six of the mid-1930s and were in use by operators such as the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy (RN) until the 1980s. Today, with de Havilland having long disappeared, very few of these engines remain in use and only a few specialist facilities can carry out overhauls.

The military historian Antony Beevor wrote that when the 11th SS Panzer Army was created the available units at best could constitute a corps, \\"'But panzer army' observed Hans-Georg Eismann 'has a better ring to it'\\". It also allowed Himmler to promote SS officers to senior staff and field commands within the formation. Obergruppenführer Felix Steiner was named its commander.Beevor p.88 The Army was officially listed as the 11th Army but it was also known as SS Panzer-Armeeoberkommando 11Tessin p.194 and is often referred to in English as the 11th SS Panzer Army. After taking part in Operation Solstice (a counter-attack) east of the Oder River during February 1945, the 11th was assigned to OB West and reorganized in March 1945. Many of the units formerly subordinated to the 11th SS Panzer Army were transferred to the 3rd Panzer Army and other units were assigned to the 11th Army for operations against the Western Allies. After defending the Weser River and the Harz Mountains, the 11th surrendered to the Western Allies on 21 April.

Hitler hoped that the units assigned to Steiner would be able to stage an effective counterattack against the northern pincer of the Soviet assault on Berlin, but Steiner refused to attack upon realizing the units were inadequate. It was the failure of this offensive that led Hitler to make his first ever declaration that Germany had lost the war. History On the second day of the Battle of Berlin, 17 April, Generaloberst Gotthard Heinrici, the Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, stripped Steiner's III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps (the Army Group's reserve) of its two strongest divisions, the SS Nordland Division and the SS Nederland Division. He placed them under the command of General der Infanterie Theodor Busse, commander of the Ninth Army, as Busse had most of the other units in the III Corps. The Nordland was sent to join Helmuth Weidling's LVI Panzer Corps defending the Seelow Heights, to stiffen the sector held by the 9th Parachute Division. The Nederland Division was sent south-west of Frankfurt (Oder) and assigned to the V SS Mountain Corps, where it was destined to be destroyed in the Battle of Halbe.Beevor p. 141 Heinrici ordered the III SS Panzer Corps, reduced to three battalions and a few tanks, to scrape together whatever forces it could find to set up a screening line along the Finow Canal to protect the southern flank of the Third Panzer Army from an attack by the Soviet Marshal Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front, which had broken through the Seelow Heights' defences and was encircling Berlin.Beevor pp. 267–268Ziemke pp. 87–88 By 21 April Adolf Hitler, ignoring the facts, started to call the ragtag units that came under Steiner's command \\"Army Detachment Steiner\\". He ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the huge salient created by the 1st Belorussian Front's breakout. Simultaneously the Ninth Army, which had been pushed south of the salient, was to attack north in a pincer attack. To facilitate this attack Steiner was assigned the three divisions of the Ninth Army's CI Army Corps, the 4th SS Polizei Division, the 5th Jäger Division, the 25th Panzergrenadier Division — all were north of the Finow CanalTo assign units on the far side of an enemy salient from their own command to that of the local command is not unusual. For example in the Battle of the Bulge General Eisenhower reassigned the US First and US Ninth armies on the north side of the salient to the 21st Army Group (also on the north side), because it was now fighting side by side with the armies of the 21st Army Group, while its parent army group (the 12th) was on the south side of the salient with the rest of the 12th's armies. — and Weidling's LVI Panzer Corps, which was still east of Berlin with its northern flank just below Werneuchen. The three divisions to the north were to attack south from Eberswalde (on the Finow Canal and 24 km (15 miles) east of Berlin) towards the LVI Panzer Corps, so cutting the 1st Belorussian Front's salient in two. Steiner called Heinrici and informed him that the plan could not be implemented because the 5th Jäger Division and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division were deployed defensively and could not be redeployed until the 2nd Naval Division arrived from the coast to relieve them. This left only two battalions of the 4th SS Police Division available, and they had no combat weapons. Heinrici called Hans Krebs, Chief German General Staff of (OKH), told him that the plan could not be implemented and asked to speak to Hitler, but was told Hitler was too busy to take his call. When, on 22 April, at his afternoon conference Hitler became convinced that Steiner was not going to attack, he fell into a tearful rage against his generals. He declared that the war was lost, blamed the generals and announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.Beevor p. 275Ziemke p. 89 After 22 April \\"Army Detachment Steiner\\" was little mentioned in the Führerbunker.Beevor p. 298 Order of battle *III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps *4th SS Polizei Division *5th Jager Division *25th Panzergrenadier Division In popular culture Hitler's rage at Steiner's failure to mount the attack was made famous by its depiction in a scene from the 2004 movie Downfall. The scene has been made into numerous parody videos in which new subtitles are added that typically have no correlation to what the characters are actually saying in German.

The Eleventh was assigned to OB West and reorganized (and given the command of new units) for combat against the Western Allies in March 1945. Steiner remained in command of the III (Germanic) SS Panzer Corps and it remained in Army Group Vistula, transferring from the Eleventh to Third Panzer Army. As Steiner also commanded the Eleventh army during 1945, it can easily be confused with Army Detachment Steiner. References Notes Footnotes Bibliography * Beevor, Antony.

The card is valid on most transit systems in the Seattle metropolitan area, including Sound Transit, local bus agencies, Washington State Ferries, the King County Water Taxi, and Kitsap Fast Ferries. It was launched in 2009 and is managed by the Central Puget Sound Regional Fare Coordination Project, a board composed of local transit agencies. The card is able to be loaded with \\"e-purse\\" value, similar to a debit card, and monthly passes. Cards are sold and reloaded at participating grocery stores, customer service centers, and ticket vending machines at transit stations. ORCA cards offer free transfers between transit systems within a two-hour window.  History  Central Puget Sound transit agencies have collaborated in a region-wide fare system since 1991 with the introduction of U-PASS and later FlexPass. In 1996, voters approved Sound Move, which called for an integrated regional fare policy for a \\"one-ticket ride\\".Sound Transit. \\"Sound Move—The 10-Year Regional Transit System Plan\\". 1996. That goal led to the creation of the PugetPass in 1999, which allowed transit riders to use a single pass for five transit agencies. (via Archive.org) On April 29, 2003, an agreement to implement a smart card system between the seven agencies in the Central Puget Sound Regional Fare Coordination Project (Sound Transit, King County Metro, Community Transit, Everett Transit, Pierce Transit, Kitsap Transit, and Washington State Ferries) was signed along with a US$43 million contract awarded to ERG Transit Systems (now Vix Technology) as the vendor and system integrator of the project. The ORCA card was originally anticipated to be operational in 2006. Introductory phase On Friday, April 17, 2009, ORCA announced a limited rollout of the regional smart card beginning April 20, 2009. The limited rollout allowed remaining technical issues in the system to be resolved. An extensive rollout and public outreach campaign followed in June 2009. Blank cards were available at no charge during the introductory period, but as of March 1, 2010, the card cost $5 ($3 for reduced fare permit holders). Users of PugetPasses, FlexPasses, and other passes were to be gradually transitioned to ORCA. =Launch timeline= The ORCA launch press kit gave a launch timeline as follows:Seattle Transit Blog - ORCA Rollout Begins Monday * April 17, 2009 – Press release announcing launch of ORCA. * April 20, 2009 – Orcacard.com and 1-888-988-ORCA call center launches.

The maximum value that can be stored in an E-purse is $300.ORCA: Fare Products/Card Types PugetPass PugetPass is a regional monthly pass that lets passengers travel on nearly every transit service in the region for a calendar month. A PugetPass is valid for payment of trip fares up to the value of the pass. Trip fares above the value of the pass may be paid with E-purse value. (Example: a passenger who has a $2.50 PugetPass and rides a service that costs $3.75 would have $2.50 covered by the PugetPass and $1.25 would be deducted from their E-Purse). Washington State Ferries does not accept the PugetPass. Pass values available range from 50¢ to $5.75.ORCA Products List Passes are priced at $36 per $1 of fare value. Regional 24-Hour Pass This pass costs $8 or $4.50 (senior/disabled and youth only) and cover up to $3.50 or $1.75 (senior/disabled and youth only) of fare value per trip on any transit service that honours the PugetPass within 24 hours of first boarding. Agency specific products and pass An agency pass covers rides on a specific transit agency's service. Examples include Washington State Ferries' monthly passes, Metro ACCESS paratransit passes, and Metro vanpool passes. Business products Employers may purchase one of two products for their employees: =ORCA Business Passport= The ORCA Business Passport is comprehensive, annual transportation pass program. Employers pay a flat annual cost per employee and each receives an ORCA card that covers almost all transit services in the Puget Sound, including Vanpool. Employers must cover all employees. =ORCA Business Choice= The ORCA Business Choice allows businesses to add funds to employee ORCA cards on a monthly basis in the form of an E-voucher. The E-voucher can be used to purchase a monthly PugetPass or E-purse value. Any unused E-voucher amount at the end of the month is removed from the employee ORCA cards and refunded to the business.ORCA Business - Products Available for Sale =Seattle Public Schools= Mayor Jenny Durkan of Seattle has proposed free ORCA cards for students enrolled in Seattle Public Schools.

If an E-purse or regional pass was used to pay fare, transfers are allowed on any bus or rail system in the region. If an agency pass was used, transfers are allowed only on services within that agency. Transfers are stored on the card and automatically calculated for the user. Transfers are not given or accepted on Washington State Ferries.ORCA: Transfer Questions Fare preset ORCA card users paying with an E-purse can set their zone preference for King County Metro and Sound Transit services. Since July 2018, King County Metro is single-zone only.ORCA FAQ: Fare Questions Card registration Several features of the ORCA card are only available when it is registered. =Balance protection= Balance protection protects the user from losing any value on the card when it is lost or stolen. A replacement card is issued with its value restored for the cost of a new card if the card is registered.ORCA FAQ: Password and Account Questions =Autoload= An Autoload automatically adds transportation products to an ORCA card on a regular basis using a Visa or MasterCard. Examples of autoloads are adding value to an E-purse when its balance falls below a certain amount and recurring purchases of monthly passes.ORCA FAQ: Revalue Questions =My ORCA account= A My ORCA account can be created on the ORCA website to monitor and manage ORCA cards. The account lets the user view transportation products stored on their card (E-purse balance, validity period of passes), transaction history, purchase additional ORCA cards for others, set up an Autoload, set fare presets, and report lost, stolen, or damaged cards.  Low-income fare  The ORCA LIFT program discounts fares to $1.50 per ride for users of the ORCA card earning less than 200% of the federal poverty level. Criticism=High cost As of March 2016, an adult ORCA card costs $5, one of the highest prices for a public transportation smart card in the United States. The King County Council has requested a study on the impact of either eliminating the $5 fee or adding $5 in value to all newly purchased cards. The report will be due in February 2017. Delay in applying credit to an ORCA card E-purse It takes between 24–48 hours for an online credit to apply to an E-purse, whether you do it directly via the web page or call customer service. The only way to get an immediate credit is to go to one of the transit stations that sell ORCA cards and reload the card via a Ticket Vending Machine or visit a customer service center or authorized retailer in person. Privacy concerns The ORCA card, especially subsidized ones, may be used to track users. Information regarding a card user's trips may be released to third parties including employers who subsidize the cards. Other parties may also obtain detailed trip information.

He is the first Italian to achieve the title of Grandmaster, which FIDE awarded him in 1974. Career Born in Florence, he became the Italian junior champion in 1965 at Turin and in 1969 at San Benedetto, the full Italian Champion. One of his greatest tournament successes followed in 1971, when he finished second at Venice (after Walter Browne and ahead of Vlastimil Hort, Lubomir Kavalek and Svetozar Gligorić). Mariotti represented his country at the Chess Olympiad in 1972, 1974, 1986 and 1988. At the Olympiad of 1974, held in Nice, he scored a double success. A board one score of 73.7% (+12 =4 −3) earned him the individual bronze medal (behind Anatoly Karpov and Delgado, jointly with Eugenio Torre) also securing his final grandmaster norm. As no Italian before him had achieved the title of International Grandmaster, he gained overnight celebrity status when the honour was bestowed on him the same year. Around this time, British Chess Magazine nicknamed him \\"The Italian Fury\\", due mainly to his formidable collection of tournament wins, but also for his enterprising, tactical style of play. He was victorious in many international tournaments, including Naples 1968, La Spezia 1969, Naples 1969, Reggio Emilia 1970, San Benedetto 1970, Bari 1971, and Rovigo 1976. He won the Rilton Cup (Stockholm) in 1976/77 and triumphed at Lugano in 1979. With regard to world championship qualification attempts, he won at the Caorle zonal of 1975, to qualify for the prestigious Manila Interzonal of 1976, where he finished joint 10th (with Boris Spassky, Wolfgang Uhlmann and Florin Gheorghiu). The result was insufficiently good to advance to the Candidates Matches. At the Praia da Rocha zonal tournament of 1978, he finished fourth, one place away from Interzonal qualification. His choice of chess opening often revolved around the Sicilian Defence or Ruy Lopez, where he was comfortable with either colour. Occasionally, his fans were treated to old-fashioned, romantic openings such as the Evans Gambit and Albin Counter Gambit and these brought him surprising success. Mariotti became an advisor for an Italian publisher and worked for the Italian Chess Federation (FSI), where he was President between 1994 and 1996. As a precursor to the Turin Olympiad of 2006, he played a website game against the 'Rest of the World' and won in 48 moves. He played again a match against the 'Rest of the World' between October 2018 and March 2019; this second match ended in a draw in 20 moves.

Although it is not a census-designated place, the ZIP Code Tabulation Area for the ZIP Code (37878) that serves Happy Valley had a population of 529 as of the 2000 U.S. Census.U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, \\"Zip Code Tabulation Area 37878 Fact Sheet.\\" Retrieved: 28 April 2008. Geography Happy Valley Missionary Baptist Church Happy Valley is situated in a narrow valley of the same name on the northwestern fringe of the Great Smoky Mountains. Chilhowee Mountain-- an elongate ridge stretching for roughly between the Little Tennessee River and the Little Pigeon River watersheds-- spans Happy Valley to the north. The valley is walled off to the south by several low ridges-- namely Pine Mountain to the southwest and Hatcher Mountain to the southeast-- which run roughly parallel to Chilhowee Mountain. Cades Cove is located opposite Hatcher and Pine Mountain to the south. Happy Valley Ridge provides the valley's eastern barrier, splitting it off from Lake in the Sky and the Top of The World community. Gregory Bald and the main crest of the western Smokies rises beyond Pine Mountain approximately to the southwest. Abrams Creek, which rises in Cades Cove, flows northwestward through the gap between Pine Mountain and Hatcher Mountain. Before it reaches Happy Valley, the creek turns southwestward and flows for several more miles before emptying into the Chilhowee Lake impoundment of the Little Tennessee River. Happy Valley's two major streams-- Mill Creek and Bell Branch-- are tributaries of Abrams Creek. Happy Valley Road, which connects U.S. Route 129 with the Look Rock section of Foothills Parkway, is the only major road access for Happy Valley. The road is accessible immediately southeast of the parkway's terminus along US-129. History=Early history Happy Valley (left) and the crest of Chilhowee Mountain (right), viewed from Foothills Parkway An expedition led by Spanish explorer Juan Pardo is believed to have passed through Happy Valley in October 1567. Pardo was attempting to reach the village of Coosa in northern Georgia via the Tennessee Valley. He left Chiaha (on Zimmerman's Island, now submerged by Douglas Lake) on October 13, marching southwest across the Foothills of the Great Smokies. He crossed Little River at what is now Walland, and camped at what is now Lake in the Sky. From there, he proceeded across Happy Valley en route to the village of Chalahume at the mouth of Abrams Creek.Charles Hudson, The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566-1568 (Tuscaloosa, Ala.: University of Alabama Press, 2005), 38. In the 18th century, Happy Valley was likely part of a Cherokee trail system connecting the Overhill towns along the Little Tennessee to the Tuckaleechee Villages in modern Townsend and tribal hunting grounds in Cades Cove.Information obtained from Tennessee Historical Commission marker IE 15 along US-321 in Townsend, Tennessee. The Overhill town of Chilhowee was situated opposite the mouth of Abrams Creek, and likely succeeded the village of Chalahume reported by Pardo.Hudson, 105. Abrams Creek was named after Old Abraham of Chilhowee, a prominent Overhill chief in the 1780s.Durwood Dunn, Cades Cove: The Life and Death of An Appalachian Community (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 260. Settlement Chilhowee Primitive Baptist Church, nicknamed \\"Red Top\\" Happy Valley's first permanent Euro-American settler, Robert Rhea, arrived in the valley sometime around 1823. Rhea was a veteran of the American Revolution and the War of 1812, and sought the land as an ideal place to spend his waning years. For nearly 40 years after Rhea's arrival, Happy Valley was known as Rhea's Valley.Inez Burns, History of Blount County, Tennessee: From War Trail to Landing Strip, 1795-1955 (Nashville: Benson Print Co., 1957), 278. In the 1830s, Cades Cove entrepreneur Daniel Davis Foute financed the construction of a road connecting his iron forge in Cades Cove with his resort hotel at Montvale Springs. Known as the Cooper Road after its builder, Joe Cooper, the road followed Abrams Creek from Cades Cove into Happy Valley, crossed Chilhowee Mountain at Murray Gap (near Look Rock), and descended to Montvale Springs. Throughout the 19th century and early 20th century, Cades Cove residents used this road to drive cattle back and forth between markets in Maryville and the grassy balds atop the western Smokies.Burns, 79-80.Michal Strutin, History Hikes of the Smokies (Gatlinburg, Tenn.: Great Smoky Mountains Association, 2003), 180. In the years following the American Civil War (1861–1865), a large number of settlers migrated from Carter County, Tennessee to Happy Valley. The valley-- which had been known as Rhea Valley-- obtained the name \\"Happy Valley\\" around this time. The name might have been inspired by Happy Valley in Carter County, which was the original home of many of the post-Civil War migrants.Burns, 247, 278. The national park and preservation The Abrams Creek entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park In 1926, conservation groups began buying up land for the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which opened in 1934. The park boundary parallels the valley to the south, and includes all of Abrams Creek. A campground and ranger station are now situated at the confluence of Kingfisher Creek and Abrams Creek. Several of the old roads, including the Cooper Road to Cades Cove, the Cane Creek Road to Walland, and the cattle drovers' paths to Gregory Bald, were converted into hiking trails.Strutin, 180-184. In 2006, a group of conservationists known as \\"Save Chilhowee Mountain\\" attempted unsuccessfully to block an 80-home development project initiated by Harmony Property Group. Save Chilhowee Mountain argued that drainage from the homes would pollute Abrams Creek, threatening three endangered species of fish. The construction group denied the accusation, claiming it had complied with all local, state, and federal regulations, and had sought technical guidance from independent environmental firms. The group received preliminary approval for construction from the Blount County Planning Commission in May 2006.Sonu Wasu, \\"Development gets Blount Co. green light, despite protest.\\" 22 June 2006.

Officine Panerai designs, manufactures and markets watches through authorized dealers and company-owned stores worldwide. Giovanni Panerai (1825–1897) founded Officine Panerai in Florence, Italy in 1860. The company is headquartered in Geneva and manufactures watches in Neuchâtel, Switzerland using both movements manufactured in-house and movements manufactured by ETA S.A. Panerai watches, designed and manufactured by Rolex SA, played a role in assisting the frogmen of the Decima Flottiglia MAS in their operations during World War II. Notable products include the Luminor and Radiomir wristwatches. History Employee of Panerai in front of the watch store in Florence in 1860 Giovanni Panerai (1825–1897) opened up his first watch shop in Florence, Italy in 1860. Giovanni's grandson Guido Panerai (1873–1934) expanded the watch shop \\"Orologeria Svizzera\\"https://perezcope.com/2018/02/22/orologeria- svizzera-the-watch-shop/ and took over his wife's family business, a mechanical workshop. In 1915, Guido Panerai invented gun sights that were illuminated by a radium-226/zinc sulfide powder enclosed in small, hermetically sealed vessels.https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/032676034/publication/GB191512270A?q=GB191512270 Radiomir, the name for the radium-based luminous mixture is derived from \\"radio mire\\", which is Italian for \\"radium sights\\". Panerai became an official supplier to the Regia Marina (the Royal Italian Navy), supplying all kinds of technical equipment and precision instruments. All Panerai watches, except for the GPF 2/56 were designed and manufactured by Rolex SA using pocket watch movements made by Swiss manufacturer Cortébert. The main driving forces behind the production of the first professional diving watches were Hans Wilsdorf of Rolex and Giuseppe Panerai. The Florence-based workshop produced wrist-worn diving instruments and, between 1935 and 1970, delivered around 1,600 watches (c. 35 2533s, 1000 3646s, 24 6152s, 36 6154s, 500 6152/1s, and 60 GPF 2/56s), most of them to the Italian Marina Militare. All watches, except for the GPF 2/56, were made by Rolex, and G. Panerai e Figlio produced only the dials for these watches. Panerai dials were rendered luminous with Radiomir, a highly radioactive radium-based self-luminous compound, and later in around 1965, with Luminor, a harmless compound activated by tritium.https://perezcope.com/2019/11/30/luminor-2020-debunking-panerais- fictional-history-of-tritium-based-lume/ The GPF 2/56 (Egiziano Grosso) was produced for the Egyptian Navy in 1956. By 1970, the company ceased to provide watches to the Marina Militare, as they were neither cost-effective nor met the naval specifications. In 1993 it then moved to launch its products in the civilian market. Following its acquisition of Panerai, Richemont repositioned Panerai as a luxury watch brand and increased prices. One of the rarest Panerai watches is a Second World War Military Diver watch. This historic watch was acquired by a British soldier named George H. Rowson in WW2 where he obtained it via a German frogman during a thwarted attempt by the Germans to destroy the Nijmegen Bridge in the Netherlands, in September 1944.

The company issues Special Editions by year. For example, in 2006 issued the 1936 California Dial Radiomir special edition, a reissue of the first Panerai model presented to the Italian Marina Militare with production limited to 1936 units. Ferrari branded Panerai products When Ferrari's contract with rival watchmaker Girard-Perregaux expired in 2005, Ferrari and Panerai entered into a five-year agreement to design, manufacture and distribute Panerai watches carrying the Ferrari trademark. The collection was branded Ferrari engineered by Panerai and consisted of two product lines marketed as \\"Granturismo\\" and \\"Scuderia\\". The collection consisted of 11 models priced between US$5,000 and US$30,000.. The Panerai- ferrari partnership ended in 2010.

The village is in the wine region known as Ribera del Arlanza, 22 km from Lerma.  History  Santa María Del Campo was rebuilt in 1440 in the Lombard-Gothic style, having already existed in the 12th century under the name of Saint Maria of the Perch. The church is located in the highest area of the town at more than 800 meters above sea level. The boundaries of the municipality of Santa María del Campo are established in approximately 60 square kilometers, and includes the town of Escuderos (with a current population of about 650 inhabitants) under its administration.  Architecture  Santa María Del Campo was built in a Latin cross plan consisting of three naves as well as two chapels on each side. The building itself is mostly a combination of two construction stages. The part located at the foot of the ships is archaic with its 13th century principles, and has a small cloister dating back to 1425. In Bishop Acuña's time at the end of the 15th century, it became a new more slender and luminous head with a cover in each end of the cruise. Among one of the greatest works of this church is the monumental tower built by Diego de Siloe in 1527 having defeated Felipe Vigarny in the contest called for its construction. The entrance to the church is covered with a barrel vault with casetones, and is flanked, externally, by half Corinthian columns, which leaves space for niches in which statues are placed. The church has a total of three entrances with the main one located under the tower and the other two located in the cruise. The northern portal was carved beginning in the 16th century. The choir was dismantled in 1757 and moved to the central nave. The masonry at the end of the 15th century, is decorated with a series of geometric motifs of an advanced Gothic style. The presbytery is located at a higher level compared to the rest of the church. Attached to one of the transept pillars is a plaster pulpit that was built during the beginning of the 16th century.  Art  The very simple yet elegant interior hosts interesting paintings, frescoes and stuccoes by local artists of the 16th and 17th centuries, including the work of Giovanni Battista Crespi (Mercy and Musiciant Angels) and the Madonna del latte by Tommasino from Mortara which is an object of great devotion, following some miracles that were attributed to Her. The main altarpiece was created by José Valdán and Joaquín de Villandiego in the 18th century. Six painting boards of different altarpieces were assembled in order to form the current altar of the trascoro, in front of the main entrance door to the church. The tables of the Degollación of San Juan Bautista and The Baptism of Christ are works of Pedro Berruguete.  Holidays  March 18 to 19, a festival is celebrated in honor of San José. In mid- August the patron saint festivities take place in honor of Our Lady of the Assumption and of San Roque. Pilgrimage of Our Lady of Squires, held on September 24.

The show transferred to the Arts Theatre in the West End for a limited season, opening on February 10, 2010 following a single preview on February 9, 2010, running until 27 February 2010.Shenton, Mark. \\"Ahrens and Flaherty's 'A Man of No Importance' to Transfer to West End's Arts Theatre\\" Playbill, January 8, 2010 Synopsis ;Act 1 In 1964 in Dublin, Ireland, Alfie Byrne is the director of an amateur theatre troupe that has been shut down by Father Kenny. The group, The St. Imelda's Players, is based at the church. Alfie, a bus conductor, wants to stage a production of Oscar Wilde's Salome at his church, despite the objections of church authorities. As he reflects on events, the actors in the troupe become, in effect, a Greek chorus and take him through a typical day of \\"A Man of No Importance\\", in the form of a play in which he is not the director but the star. As the \\"play\\" unfolds, the people in Alfie's life appear: his sister Lily, a handsome bus driver Robbie Fay, and newcomer Adele Rice. Alfie \\"performs\\" by speaking Wilde's words to Adele, impressing the bus passengers (who are members of the acting group). As Alfie prepares dinner for himself and Lily, he tells her that he has met a woman. Lily has delayed marriage with her boyfriend Mr. Carney to take care of Alfie until he marries, and is happy for him (\\"Burden of Life\\"). Alfie explains that he is not interested in marriage to Adele – he wants her to act in 'Salome'. Frustrated, Lily castigates Alfie for wasting his time in amateur theatre. The next day, Alfie goes around to Mr. Carney and the other troupe members to offer them parts in \\"Salome\\". Everyone is extremely excited about a new show starting, and each member shows their acting resume as they sing about their excitement (\\"Going Up!\\"). The next day, Alfie delays the bus from leaving just to allow Adele to catch the bus, which she was late for due to an appointment with the doctor. He attempts to convince her to be Princess Salome, the titular character of \\"Salome\\", by reading some verses of the play to her. Adele believes that Alfie is making fun of her like many in her old town and storms out of the bus. Confused, Alfie follows her out of the bus. Despite her fears that she, a regular common girl from Roscommon, would never be able to portray a princess, Adele is touched by his words and agrees to be in the play (\\"Princess\\"). After the first reading, Alfie attempts to talk Robbie into being \\"Salome\\"'s main romantic lead of John the Baptist. Robbie dismisses Alfie's attempts to get him involved, and conversely invites him to take a step into his own world, convincing Alfie to explore the streets of Dublin and to go to a pub with his pals (\\"Streets of Dublin\\"). At the pub, Alfie goes through several traditions for newcomers, including ordering a pint and singing a song in front of Robbie's pals (\\"Love's Never Lost\\"). Robbie's pals are not impressed, leading to Alfie to wander off where he is propositioned by Breton Beret. Alfie is flustered by Breton and returns home, troubled about his true identity. Meanwhile, Mr. Carney is with Lily at her and Alfie's home, condemning \\"Salome\\" as horrid pornography. Shortly after, Mr. Carney and Lily share some private drinks as they discuss Alfie's 'odd' habit of reading books and cooking foreign dishes; Mr. Carney attempts to woo Lily all the while, but Lily refuses to marry \\"till [Alfie's] wed\\" (\\"Books\\"). Alfie interrupts them as he returns home, and storms up to his room. As he gazes at himself in the mirror, he sees Oscar Wilde in a dream, and admits that he loves Robbie (\\"Man in the Mirror\\"). After a rehearsal of 'Salome', Lily invites Adele for Sunday dinner, saying that Alfie is hesitant to speak for himself (\\"Burden of Life\\" – Reprise). As Alfie is walking her home, Adele tells him that in her home town she has a boyfriend, John, and starts crying when she can't explain why he isn't here with her. Understanding about secrets, Alfie advises her that everything's alright (\\"Love Who You Love\\"). Alfie bumps into Breton Beret again after he's escorted Adele home, and he propositions Alfie again before going on his way. Alfie is trapped between his own shame and desire, but Oscar Wilde again advises him that the way to eliminate temptation is by giving in. ;Act 2 As Mrs. Patrick sings a hymn (\\"Our Father\\"), Alfie is confessing to Father Kenny, as he tells about his minor sins. Alfie hears Robbie in a disembodied voice, but he cannot confess to his feelings (\\"Confession\\"). After church, Alfie leaves Lily and Mr. Carney to pay respects at their father's grave; there he meets Baldy, who brings a bouquet of white lilies to lay at his wife Mary's grave, reminiscing about the \\"Cuddles that Mary Gave\\" before encouraging Alfie to find a wife of his own. One and a half weeks before the opening night, the troupe is rehearsing and going through some interesting ideas on how to address the problems of props, costumes, lighting, promotion, and choreography (\\"Art\\"). Struggling through the lines of the final scene where Princess Salome professes her love to the severed head of John the Baptist, Adele suddenly cries and tells Alfie that she is pregnant, then leaves after Alfie awkwardly confirms that she is unmarried. Alfie is called to an emergency Sodality meeting organized by Mr. Carney, where the play 'Salome' is deemed blasphemous (\\"A Man of No Importance (Reprise)/Confusing Times\\"); Monsignor cancels it and orders that the St. Imelda's Players be ended. Alfie, feeling sad, goes to the bus station where he catches Robbie engaging in extramarital affairs with Mrs. Patrick. Shocked, Alfie questions Robbie's professed love to Mrs. Patrick, as she is married with 3 children. Robbie is furious at Alfie's judgments and berates Alfie for judging him when Alfie has lived a loveless life, before leaving Alfie alone (\\"Love who you Love (Robbie's Reprise)\\"). Going home to his room, Alfie is visited by a multitude of visions of the townfolk, Robbie, and Oscar Wilde, who tell him how to dress and how to express his hidden self (\\"Man in the Mirror\\"). Convinced that \\"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it\\" and newly dressed in clothes that indicate his sexuality, Alfie goes to the pub and propositions Breton Beret. Breton takes Alfie's hand, caresses him, but suddenly punches Alfie in the next moment. Breton calls others over to beat him as well. As they beat him, Alfie cries out in pain for Robbie and Breton reveals that they regularly use this method to hunt for \\"poofters\\". He and the others only stop beating him and run away when a policeman comes over to investigate. Lily and Carney find Alfie with the policeman and take Alfie home, but not before the policeman reveals that Alfie won't press charges for assault because it would reveal that Alfie is gay. The next morning, Lily and Alfie are having breakfast when they erupt into an argument after Lily refuses to eat what may be \\"tainted\\" food, with Alfie venomously explaining that he's never had any opportunity to be tainted by homosexual relations. Lily responds with both fury and despair, bemoaning the wasted years looking after her brother and asking why he never told her the truth. He leaves in the middle of her argument, leaving her alone as she ends with \\"you must have known I'd love you all the same\\" (\\"Tell me Why\\"). The news spreads that Alfie is gay and he finds that many people now treat him with contempt and disgust, including his abusive supervisor and new bus driver who they claim was to take the spot of Robbie who \\"fled as far as he could when he heard the news\\". Adele comes to see Alfie one last time before she goes to England to have her baby, showing true empathy for his situation and encouraging him as Alfie once encouraged her (\\"Love who you Love (Adele's Reprise)\\"). Finally, Alfie is alone at St. Imelda's hall and thinks back on his life, coming to know that he can no longer hide (\\"Welcome to the World\\"). A ray of sunlight enters the dimly lit room as Robbie walks in, and he explains that he's here to play the part of John the Baptist and that he was forcefully placed in another station by the supervisor. He is followed by most of the members of St. Imelda's Players (other than Mr. Carney), who reveal that they don't care about his sexuality as they know that Alfie is a good and kind man. Lily enters as well, bringing refreshments stolen from Mr. Carney. Now a member of the new acting troupe, Robbie reads a passage from Oscar Wilde's \\"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\\" (\\"Poem\\").

Search engine optimization professionals first research keywords, and then align web pages with these keywords to achieve better rankings in search engines. Once they find a niche keyword, they expand on it to find similar keywords. Keyword suggestion tools usually aid the process, like the Google Ads Keyword Planner, which offers a thesaurus and alternative keyword suggestions. Google's first party data also aids this research through the likes of Google autocomplete or People Also Ask. Importance of research= Keyword research  The objective of keyword research is to generate, with good precision and recall, a large number of terms that are highly relevant yet non-obvious to the given input keyword. The process of keyword research involves brainstorming and the use of keyword research tools. To achieve the best SEO results, it is important to optimize a website's content as well as backlinks for the most relevant keywords. It is good practice to search for related keywords that have low competition and still a high number of searches. This makes it easier to achieve a higher rank in search engines which usually results in higher web traffic. The downside of this practice is that the website is optimized for alternative keywords instead of the main keyword; main keywords might be very difficult to rank for due to high competition. There are three essential concepts to consider when conducting keyword research. Good keywords are closely related to the subject of the website. Most search engines use an internal quality system to check website relevance related to possible keywords, a non-relevant keyword is unlikely to rank well for a website. Good keywords that are highly competitive are less likely to rank in the top. Keywords that have no monthly searches are believed to generate little to no traffic and therefore of little value for SEO. Keyword stuffing in a web page should be avoided.  Types of keywords  Keywords are divided into two primary groups based on search volume. * Short-Tail Keywords: Short-Tail Keywords are the most commonly searched 20% of keywords. These are typically extremely competitive. * Long-Tail Keywords: Long-Tail Keywords consist of the other 80% of search traffic. They are more likely to consist of phrases and typically have far fewer average searches per month.  Research examples  A very popular and highly competitive keyword on Google search engine is \\"making money.\\" It has 4,700,000,000 search results, meaning that billions of websites are relevant or competing for that keyword. Keyword research starts with finding all possible word combinations that are relevant to the \\"making money\\" keyword. For example, a keyword \\"acquiring money\\" has significantly fewer search results, only 116,000,000, but it has the same meaning as \\"making money.\\" Another way is to be more specific about a keyword by adding additional filters. For example the keyword \\"making money online from home in Canada\\" is less competitive on a global scale and therefore easier to rank for. Furthermore, keywords also have various intents which can affect whether the marketer would want to target that keyword. Multiple tools are available (both free and commercial) to find keywords and analyze them.  Keyword research tools = Google Ads Keyword Planner  Google offers free tools to do some basic keyword analysis. All the results are based on data of the Google search engine. Google recently released an update to the Google keyword planner and changes some of its policy by which the first campaign must be set in order to get the keyword planner back. This is a type of Google Ads account that is used by agencies and consultants to manage many different advertising accounts. Features of Google Ads Keyword Planner: * Get search volume estimates for the keyword. * Generate new keywords by combining different keyword lists. * Create new keyword variations based on primary keyword. * Provides Keywords used for websites – useful for competitive analysis. Limitations of Google Ads Keyword Planner: * Hides long tail keywords data as the tool is made for Google Ads and not for SEO purposes. * Keywords generated by the device may not produce good results as the tool is targeted towards advertisers and not SEO. * The search volume displayed received a change in 2016, Google started limiting the output options to advertisers (or accounts) with lower or no monthly spending.  Google Suggest  Google has introduced Google Suggest in 2012. Google Suggest is typically used as a live feature while a user is typing a search phrase into the browser or Google website. Google Suggest uses the organic search input of billions of users and try to \\"guess\\" that way what a user might be searching for even before he completed entering the query or all the words of a keyword phrase. This makes Google Suggest a relevant source for keyword research, it contains a large amount of organic keywords very closely related to a full or partial keyword and can be used to find additional most searched appending keywords that make the whole keyword less competitive. Google Suggest can be researched through the Google Search website or through a compatible browser for a small amount of keywords but also in large scale using free scraper tools.  Bing Ads Keyword Planner  The Bing Ads Keyword Planner provides keyword and ad group suggestions and shows average monthly search volume trends, relative competition and suggested bids. Features of Bing Keyword Planner: * Get search volume data and trends. * Get performance and cost estimates. * Multiply keyword lists to get new keywords. Limitations of Bing Ads Keyword Planner: * Bing holds only 20 percent of the U.S. search engine market share, the data provided may not be reliable at least not for optimizing websites for Google search engine. * Similar to Google Ads Keyword Planner, data furnished by the tool is for helping advertisers and not publishers.

Plot summary This historical detective story features a young police inspector, Erast Fandorin. Fandorin's adventures take place in the Russian Empire of the late 19th century, and he regularly finds himself at the center of key historical events, including development of Masonic and Revolutionary movements. The hero is a young man, newly enlisted in the police force of the 1870s. This is a world with no forensic science, a rigid social structure and rigid proprieties, and police investigation techniques which respect the intuition of the intelligent amateur or newcomer. Fandorin is inexperienced, naive, downwardly mobile (the family fortune having evaporated), but cultured, intelligent, diligent, and desperately enthusiastic. He doesn't so much want to impress as want to succeed ... by a process of blind self-confidence and a youthful self-delusion that he is acting logically and scientifically. Fandorin is invited to investigate the suicide of a rich student. The young man has shot himself in public, but something seems strange about the suicide. Fandorin quickly exposes the murderous intrigue which has led to the death ... and opens up a can of worms which will have him crossing Europe in search of a mastermind ... or maybe even the godfathers behind a terrorist plot.

It is Hornsby's second solo album and his fifth overall studio release (three previously with The Range). \\"Walk in the Sun\\" and \\"Cruise Control\\", from the album, were released as singles (with radio edits). The album's cover art, featuring an imagined jam session between bluegrass legend Bill Monroe and jazz legend Charlie Parker, served as an apt metaphor for the rich fusion of musical styles Hornsby was developing and expanding. The album found Hornsby expanding upon the foray into jazz sound from Harbor Lights, this time reintroducing elements of bluegrass from A Night On The Town and his earlier collaborations. Much like the socially conscious lyrics of his earlier work, the underlying messages behind the catchy tunes are often very dark, such as on \\"Country Doctor\\", \\"Hot House Ball\\" and \\"White Wheeled Limousine\\", where story-telling lyrics build around spousal murder, nuclear disaster, and wedding-day adultery, respectively. The album featured many of Harbor Lights' guests, such as Pat Metheny and Jimmy Haslip. Béla Fleck also collaborates again on banjo. The album's closing track, \\"Cruise Control,\\" is the last Hornsby song on which Jerry Garcia played guitar; at a concert he performed in Buffalo, New York, in August 2008 on the anniversary of Garcia's death, Hornsby said Garcia had wanted to play on \\"Country Doctor\\", but was given an easier tune to play because of his poor health. \\"White Wheeled Limousine\\" had debuted five years earlier as an encore to Branford Marsalis's opening act for the Grateful Dead's New Year's Concert on December 31, 1990, when Marsalis and Rob Wasserman joined Hornsby in the performance. The Hot House version of \\"White Wheeled Limousine\\" pairs Pat Metheny's guitar with Béla Fleck's banjo for a blisteringly intricate call-and-response alongside Hornsby's piano runs. Hot House also makes an homage to Hornsby's years with the Dead via his recasting of the chorus/bridge of the Dead's song \\"Estimated Prophet\\" as the newly lyricized Hornsby tune \\"Tango King.\\" The album also boasts a more prominent role for Harbor Lights alum John D'earth on trumpet and introduces Bobby Read on woodwinds and J. V. Collier on bass. Read and Collier continue to perform with Hornsby.

University Hall is a white granite building designed by the great early American architect Charles Bulfinch and built by the noted early engineer Loammi Baldwin, Jr. It is located in Harvard Yard on the campus of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance. The hall was designed by Bulfinch, class of 1781, and built between 1813–1815 of white Chelmsford granite, probably using rock cut to size at the Charlestown Prison. It consists of a partial basement story, plus three full stories raised above ground as well as an additional story set within the roofline. The long east and west facades are very similar, and symmetrically arranged with two entrances per facade, each flanked by pilasters; smaller north and south facades present rows of windows. Total construction cost was $65,000 of which $53,000 was paid by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. University Hall, west facade in 1869. University Hall's first floor contained the College Commons (dining room) until 1849. The building also contained a library and philosophical (scientific) apparatus, as well as a chapel within the second and third floors. A massive portico with stone pillars was added to the western facade soon after completion, but removed in 1842. In 1849 the first floor was partitioned into classrooms; in 1867 the chapel was partitioned as well. In 1896 the chapel was restored and used for meetings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In 1924 Daniel Chester French's bronze statue of John Harvard was moved to the western façade from its original location near Memorial Hall.  1969 Occupation  In protest of the Vietnam War and Harvard's connections to it, students occupied University Hall on the night of April 8 to 9, 1969, forcing out Harvard officials and staff. In the early morning hours of April 10 the occupiers were ejected and some 100 to 300 persons arrested; about 50 were injured.

In both countries, men's field lacrosse and women's lacrosse are played at both the varsity and club levels. College lacrosse in Canada is sponsored by the Canadian University Field Lacrosse Association (CUFLA) and Maritime University Field Lacrosse League (MUFLL), while in the United States, varsity men's and women's lacrosse is governed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). There are also university lacrosse programs in the United Kingdom sponsored by British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) and programs in Japan. In the U.S., as of the 2019–20 academic year, there were 74 NCAA-sanctioned Division I men's lacrosse teams, 75 Division II men's lacrosse teams, and 248 Division III men's lacrosse teams. There are 117 Division I women's lacrosse teams, 114 Division II women's lacrosse teams, and 293 Division III women's lacrosse teams. There were also 21 men's programs and 11 women's programs at two-year community colleges organized by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and a growing number of National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) four-year small college programs. As of 2016–17, there were 184 collegiate men's club teams competing through the Men's Collegiate Lacrosse Association (MCLA), including most major universities in the United States without NCAA men's programs, organized into two divisions and ten conferences. Schools that feature an NCAA Division I FBS football team must play in Division 1, while most other teams compete in Division 2. There are 225 collegiate club teams for women organized by the Women's Collegiate Lacrosse Associates (WCLA). History of college lacrosse The first intercollegiate game in the United States was played on November 22, 1877 between New York University and Manhattan College. Lacrosse had been introduced in upstate New York in the 1860s. Lacrosse was further introduced to the Baltimore area in the 1890s. These two areas continue to be hotbeds of college lacrosse in the U.S. An organizing body for the sport, the U. S. National Amateur Lacrosse Association, was founded in 1879. The first intercollegiate lacrosse tournament was held in 1881, with Harvard beating Princeton, 3–0, in the championship game. New York University and Columbia University also participated. In 1882 three colleges formed a league called the Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (ILA), which four other colleges soon joined. From this point through 1931, collegiate lacrosse associations chose an annual champion based on season records. In 1894, the Inter-University Lacrosse League (IULL) began play using slightly different rules. The two leagues merged in December 1905 to form the 8-team United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse League. The USILL was a closed-membership league, which excluded several lacrosse powers, such as the U.S. Naval Academy. The national championship was officially bestowed only upon teams that were included in the membership of these organizations. In 1912, the USILL established Northern and Southern Divisions and began conducting a post-season playoff. Harvard defeated Swarthmore, 7–3, in the first formal playoff. This system continued through 1925. As Navy was not a member of the USILL, its teams were not eligible for the championship, even though Navy had the best collegiate record in many of those years. Navy was undefeated from 1917 through 1923, a stretch of 40 games with one tie. The USILL was replaced by the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association in March, 1926, as an open-membership governing body. Six more teams became new USILA members, in addition to the former USILL teams. The USILA bestowed gold medals upon the teams that it selected as national champions through the 1931 season. No official champions were named from 1932 through 1935. In 1936, an award was established in the memory of a Baltimore sportswriter to recognize annually the most outstanding teams. From 1936 through 1972, the USILA executive board awarded the Wingate Memorial Trophy to the national champions. From at least 1951, if not earlier, lacrosse divisions were officially named after legendary lacrosse-men. These were the Cy Miller, Laurie D. Cox, and Roy Taylor Divisions. They were more commonly referred to Division I, or A; Division II, or B; and Division III, or C. All college teams were placed in one of the three divisions, dependent upon their records, schedules, and success for the preceding five years, and a point system was created. Any team of the three divisions was eligible to win the national championship, but this was virtually impossible for non-Division I teams. A Division II team, playing several Division I teams, might have been able to achieve it. A team's record was required to include six games against teams in its own division. Teams were realigned every three years, again reflecting their records. All schools were eligible for the national rankings. The team that achieved the highest point total each year, however, was not guaranteed a solo national championship. The system served as guidance to the USILA executive board, who chose co-champions on frequent occasions. This point system prevailed with modifications until the NCAA in the early 1970s established the playoff system for determining champions. At its 1969 annual meeting in Baltimore, the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association voted for its first playoff tournament to determine a national champion. In 1971, the NCAA began sponsoring men's lacrosse and began holding an annual championship tournament for Division I schools. The USILA conducted a small college tournament for non-Division I schools in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, the NCAA took over the sponsorship of this tournament through the 1979 season, with separate tournaments being conducted in both 1980 and 1981 for Divisions II and III teams. The Division II tournament then was discontinued until returning in 1993.  Scholarships  In some circumstances, D-1 schools can offer several scholarships that cover up to 50% of tuition costs. As of 2018, the average awarded D-1 men's lacrosse scholarship is about $12,000 a year.  NCAA Men's Lacrosse  NCAA Lacrosse logo The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is the largest association and governing body of collegiate athletics in the United States. The NCAA holds lacrosse championships for all three Divisions in men's and women's lacrosse. Currently the NCAA has 397 men's lacrosse programs and 524 women's lacrosse programs.  Division I Men's Lacrosse  A map of NCAA Division I men's lacrosse teams. UNC vs. Duke (2009). Division I men's lacrosse currently has the smallest number of teams compared to the Division II and Division III levels. The 2020 NCAA lacrosse season, canceled in progress due to coronavirus concerns, involved 74 NCAA Division I men's lacrosse teams, with 71 of them organized into 10 conferences, and three teams playing as independent D-I programs without a conference affiliation. These teams are heavily concentrated in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, and only four teams are not in the Eastern Time Zone. From 1936 through 1970 the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) selected the Wingate Memorial Trophy winners as national champions based on regular season records. Beginning in 1971, the National Collegiate Athletic Association began holding an annual championship tournament. The most recent national champions from 2019 are the Virginia Cavaliers. The most recent changes to men's lacrosse conferences occurred in the 2014 off-season. The Big Ten Conference sponsored the sport for the first time in 2015. The Big Ten move, along with other changes stemming from the early-2010s NCAA conference realignment, led to the demise of ECAC Lacrosse. The Southern Conference (SoCon) took over men's lacrosse sponsorship from the Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN), which itself had only added the sport for the 2013–14 school year. This was a friendly takeover, as the two conferences had agreed in January 2014 to form a lacrosse alliance under which they would divide lacrosse sponsorship, with men's shifting to the SoCon and women's remaining with the ASUN. In September 2018 the NCAA rules committee implemented an 80-second shot clock that begins upon possession. A team must advance the ball across midfield within the first 20 seconds, and then 60 seconds to shoot the ball once across midfield. The clock will only reset if the ball hits the goalie or the post. Failure to score before the shot clock runs out results in a change of possession. ;Conferences * America East Conference * Atlantic Coast Conference * Big East Conference * Big Ten Conference * Colonial Athletic Association * Independents — Three schools, all relatively new varsity programs, were independents in the abbreviated 2020 season.

Division II lacrosse is made up of 75 teams, mainly located in the Northeast and Southeast. The USILA conducted a \\"small college\\" lacrosse championship tournament in 1972 and 1973. Division II men's lacrosse held its first NCAA tournament in 1974 with an eight-team bracket. The format remained the same until 1980, when the field dropped to just two teams as the Division III tournament was inaugurated. From 1982 through 1992, a Division II playoff was not conducted. In 2001, a four-team bracket was instituted. The Division II men’s lacrosse championship bracket expanded from four to eight teams starting with the 2013 season. Adelphi University currently holds the record for the number of D-II championships, with seven and also appeared in the championship a record 11 times. NCAA Division II lacrosse programs are organized into eight conferences, as well as independent programs consisting of mainly new D-II lacrosse teams. The newest addition to the roster of Division II men's lacrosse conferences came in 2017–18 when the Great Lakes Valley Conference began sponsoring men's lacrosse. On December 2, 2014; the University of Alabama In Huntsville (UAH) announced the additional of Men's and Women's Lacrosse programs. These programs began competition with the 2016 season, initially as independents. The most recent Division II men's national champions are the Merrimack Warriors, which could not defend their title as they began a transition to Division I immediately after the 2019 season.

The NCAA Division III championship originally was combined with Division II from 1974–1979, before the NCAA split the non-Division I schools into separate Division II and III tournaments in 1980. Hobart has made a record 15 appearances in the championship game and won a total of 13 championships. Hobart lacrosse also won the championship the first 12 years it was held from 1980–1991. The 12 consecutive championships are an NCAA record but Hobart has not won again since 1993, and now plays at the Division I level. Salisbury University now follows closely with 12 non-consecutive championships and 17 appearances.

The NCAA holds lacrosse championships for all three divisions and currently has 524 women's lacrosse programs. Women's collegiate lacrosse was originally governed by the U.S. Women's Lacrosse Association, which joined with the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) to determine an annual champion. The USWLA and AIAW conducted championships from 1978–1982 before being usurped by the NCAA. The NCAA began sponsoring a Division III championship in 1985 and added a Division II championship in 2001.  Division I Women's Lacrosse  A map of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse teams. The NCAA began sponsoring a women's lacrosse championship in 1982. Lacrosse has grown into 117 NCAA Division I women's lacrosse teams organized into 16 conferences. Only 13 programs are located outside the Eastern Time Zone—Northwestern, Vanderbilt, Denver, six Pac-12 Conference members, and four California schools outside the Pac-12. Of these 13 schools, only Denver also sponsors varsity men's lacrosse. The most recent change to the lineup of women's lacrosse conferences came during the 2020 offseason, when the Mid-American Conference (MAC) added women's lacrosse for the 2021 season. The newest Division I women's lacrosse school is Youngstown State, which starts play in the 2021 season as a single-sport member of the MAC. Two other schools will begin play in the 2022 season, both playing the sport in their respective all-sports homes—Eastern Michigan in the MAC and Pittsburgh in the ACC.

Division II women's lacrosse is one of the newest championships sponsored by the NCAA. The first Division II women's lacrosse championship was held in 2001, when C.W. Post beat West Chester 13–9. Since then, the Division II level has been dominated, much like its men's counterpart, by Adelphi University with nine national championships, most recently in 2019. The 114 NCAA Division II women's lacrosse programs are organized into 10 conferences, as well as independent programs. The defending Division II national champion is Adelphi.

As of October, 2016, There are a 39 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) schools that offer men’s and/or women’s varsity lacrosse, Lacrosse is an officially recognized sport by the NAIA. NAIA programs are currently in year two of NAIA invitational sport status. During this phase of recognition, teams compete to participate in a post season championship called the NAIA National Invitational. Each conference and A.I.I group receive one automatic qualifier with the remaining four bids going to the highest remaining teams from the NAIA national ranking. NAIA programs also regularly compete against NCAA DII and DIII teams. The Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference (WHAC) announced on January 27, 2012, the addition of lacrosse for both men and women as conference sports effective the fall of 2012. The WHAC was the first conference in the NAIA to offer lacrosse as a conference championship sport. The Appalachian Athletics Conference and the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference recognized lacrosse as a conference sport in the Fall of 2015.  NJCAA Lacrosse  The National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) is the primary governing body of community college athletic programs in the USA and currently oversees 21 men's and 11 women's lacrosse programs predominately in the Northeastern United States. The NJCAA lacrosse programs do not compete in their regular conferences, but instead are ranked within their NJCAA Regions. The NJCAA has sponsored a men's lacrosse championship since 1970 and a women's lacrosse championship since 2004. There are also new lacrosse programs at community colleges that are not members of the NJCAA, such as the California Community College Athletic Association, which does not sponsor the sport at this time.

The incident was made into the crime drama film Dog Day Afternoon (1975), directed by Sidney Lumet. The character Leon Shermer, played by Chris Sarandon, is loosely based on Eden. Early life Eden was born on August 19, 1946, in Ozone Park, Queens. Relationship with Wojtowicz  In 1971, she and Wojtowicz met at the Feast of San Gennaro in New York City. The two, Elizabeth in a bridal gown and John in military attire, wed in a public ceremony that year. Following a series of suicide attempts, which Wojtowicz attributed to Eden's despondency over her inability to afford gender affirming surgery, Eden was admitted to a psychiatric institution. The following year, on August 22, 1972, Wojtowicz attempted to rob a Chase Manhattan bank branch in Gravesend, Brooklyn. Eden was not aware of the plans. Wojtowicz was sentenced to 20 years, but released in 1978. Wojtowicz did two more stretches in prison for parole violations in 1984 and 1986-87. He said he was released in April 1987, and Eden visited him in New York about once a month. The film Dog Day Afternoon shows Sonny (the Wojtowicz character) making out a will to give Leon (Eden's character) his life insurance so that even if he were killed, \\"Leon\\" could pay for the operation. The real-life Wojtowicz was paid $7500, plus 1% of the film's net profits, for the rights to his story, from which he gave Eden enough money to pay for the surgery.

Featuring lyrics written by Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker about an ex- girlfriend, the song sees the narrator mock his ex-girlfriend for leading a dull life after dumping him. \\"Razzmatazz\\" was the band's final single for Gift Records, charting at number 80 in the UK. The single was released independently of an album, although it appeared as a bonus track at the end of the US version of His 'n' Hers. Since its release, the song has seen positive critical reception and has appeared on multiple compilation albums. Background The lyrics to \\"Razzmatazz\\" were written by Jarvis Cocker about a former girlfriend. Cocker explained, \\"Yeah, I did have a girlfriend when I was at college who I wrote this song, 'Razzmatazz,' about. And then I was kind of embarrassed, I bumped into her a few years later and she twigged that it was about her and it wasn't very complementary. Actually, we ended up laughing about it; it was all right.\\" When asked about the song's lyrics, Cocker stated, \\"I don't think they're seedy. They're just true to life. I think they're deadpan and down to earth. I don't think they're strange. Razzmatazz is a bit sad.\\" Cocker explained in Melody Maker, \\"It's the most bitter song we've ever done, but however harsh I am about the people in 'Razzmatazz', I’m not writing from above their level. I've got a lot of experience of being as sad as them, if not more so.\\" Cocker was critical of the song's original production, stating, \\"I had some problems with the initial mix—it sounded a little A Flock of Seagulls-like, so we remixed it with Phil Vinall early in '93.\\" Lyrics and music According to The National, the song features \\"a wry, bitter take on intimacy.\\" In \\"Razzmatazz,\\" the narrator is depicted as having been dumped by a girlfriend who demanded a more glamorous lifestyle, only to relish in how his ex-girlfriend has let herself go and is living a dull life. Notable for its bitter, witty lyrics, the song features the narrator mocking his ex-girlfriend for \\"getting fatter\\" after their relationship, for leaving parties alone, and for \\"going with some kid who looks like some bad comedian.\\" \\"Razzmatazz\\" features what The Guardian described as a \\"dark disco-charged melody, flavoured impeccably by Cocker's witty, withering vinegar.\\" Stereogum noted that the song has a \\"gloss that pointed towards the more thorough production standards of the following year's His 'n' Hers.\\" Release \\"Razzmatazz\\" was released as the third and final single by the band on their new label, Gift Records. The B-side of the single was the suite of songs Inside Susan – A Story in 3 Parts; Cocker explained, \\"You follow this character from early adolescence through to early thirties and married to an architect somewhere in South London. The last part, \\"59 Lyndhurst Grove\\", was inspired by a party I'd been to the weekend before.\\" Upon its release, the song was named the Melody Maker single of the week. In the UK, the single charted at number 80, the highest singles chart position for the band up to that point. After its single release, the song was included as the final track on the American release of His 'n' Hers. It has also appeared on the compilations Intro – The Gift Recordings and Hits. A music video for the song was also released to promote the song. Reception \\"Razzmatazz\\" has seen critical acclaim and has been labelled by many writers as one of Pulp's best songs. Brad Sanders of Stereogum called it \\"arguably [His 'n' Hers] very best track.\\" Sarah Dempster of NME called the song a \\"Formica-topped, sad-eyed, retro-unique delight.\\" NME readers ranked the song as Pulp's fourth best in a fan vote, writing, \\"Yes it's angry and bitter, but it was also eloquently angry, and scabrously witty to boot – Jarvis doing his modern day, indie Oscar Wilde thing brilliantly.\\" Stereogum's Ryan Leas ranked it as the band's third best, calling the song \\"one of their finest achievements\\" and writing, \\"While it isn't as sonically rough as what they’d explore later, 'Razzmatazz' has a mean intensity in it not so often seen in their mid '90s work.\\" The Guardian named it as one of Pulp's ten best songs, dubbing it \\"a supreme pop single with its spinning, dark disco-charged melody, flavoured impeccably by Cocker's witty, withering vinegar.\\" Orange County Weekly named the song as the number nine Pulp song for beginners. \\"Razzmatazz\\" was also been voted as the fourth best indie song of all time on 23indie's 'All Time Indie Top 50'.

About the same time his father began teaching him clarinet on the \\"Albert Method\\". Devoting himself to practice, Gallodoro earned a spot with Romeo and His Juliets and made his first stage appearance at Birmingham's Lyric Theatre in 1926. The next summer he toured the Gulf Coast with Birmingham banjo player George Evans and decided to settle in New Orleans, Louisiana, where his family joined him. After six years of playing nightclubs, speakeasies and vaudeville shows at the Orpheum Theater, Gallodoro moved to New York City and worked in radio bands. In 1933 he briefly joined Isham Jones' big band, making one record session with it. In 1936 he was hired to play lead alto saxophone in Paul Whiteman's orchestra, among the most popular performing groups of the era. After that group disbanded in 1940 he was hired to play bass clarinet in the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini. Among his credits is the famed opening clarinet glissando from the 1945 Warner Brothers film Rhapsody in Blue.

Gallodoro contributed countless saxophone solos to that station's programs over two decades and continued to do live radio work throughout his life. Known for effortlessly transitioning from classical to jazz idioms and for a clean and virtuosic style, Gallodoro was much in demand as a session recording artist. Composer Ferde Grofé tailored his Gallodoro’s Serenade for Saxophone and Piano for him in 1958, which he recorded in 2004 (Grofe and Gershwin: Symphonic Jazz).

It is north-west of the centreof the town of Ashford, Kent, UK.  Description  Godinton House is an ancient brick house with a Jacobean-style exterior. The roof has a distinctive system of Dutch gables (also called semi-classical gables). The Jacobean house was built around a medieval great hall. Of particular note is the elaborate carvings in chestnut wood on the main staircase. The gardens include one of the longest Yew hedges in England, as well as having spectacular displays of delphiniums, irises, wild flowers and roses. The house also has a Steinway piano. It hosts one of the best private collections of porcelain in the South of England. The Last Day in the Old Home, a composite of rooms at Godinton  History  Godinton House was the seat of the Toke family for about 455 years from 1440 to 1895. Around the turn of the century (19th/20th) then owner Mr. Ashley Dodd hired the architect Sir Reginald Blomfield to update the house and redesign the gardens. Blomfield planted the famous yew hedge, shaped to repeat the gable form seen on the house. In 1991 Major Alan Wyndham-Green, the last owner of Godinton, established the Godinton House Preservation Trust. Since Major Wyndham-Green's passing in 1996 the Trust has continued to preserve, restore, and enhance the house and parklands.

Rankin had died one month earlier, on 8 October 1973. Rankin had held the seat since 1955. With the exception of a narrow Conservative victory in 1950, the seat had been solidly Labour-held since 1918. For the by-election the Labour Party nominated Harry Selby, a veteran activist in Glasgow and a former Trotskyist. It was later reported that Selby's selection had been controversial with some Labour members who felt that at the age of 61 he was too old to be starting a parliamentary career. The Conservative Party, long the main opposition in the constituency, nominated John Mair, but as they were in mid-term government, they expected little from the election. Party support had also suffered after refusing the important local employer Upper Clyde Shipbuilders a government loan to continue operations. The Scottish National Party (SNP) had barely won 10% of the vote in the constituency at the 1970 general election. Nonetheless, nationalist sentiment had increased following the discovery of North Sea Oil, and the party had performed very well in the 1971 Stirling and Falkirk by-election, and the 1973 Dundee East by-election. The SNP nominated the young teacher Margo MacDonald. The Liberal Party, despite having held the constituency for considerable periods prior to 1918, had little base in Glasgow and had not even contested it in 1970. They stood Peter McMillan. The withdrawal of the Liberal Party allowed the Communist Party of Great Britain to poll fourth in 1970, with only 326 votes. With such a low count, they chose not to contest the 1973 by-election. Results MacDonald won a shock victory for the SNP; this was the party's fourth Parliamentary election victory, after the 1945 Motherwell by-election, the 1967 Hamilton by-election, and the Western Isles seat in 1970. The party gained an additional 31.2% of the vote, and MacDonald sat alongside Donald Stewart, SNP MP for the Western Isles, in the British House of Commons. The Glasgow Herald described the result as a \\"debacle\\" for Labour, which proved that \\"no Labour seat is safe from Nationalist assault.\\" The Labour vote fell sharply, in an ominous defeat for the party, given that a general election was expected soon. The Conservative vote halved, and the party lost its deposit, placing only just ahead of the Liberals. In the aftermath of the defeat it was reported that there was criticism of the Labour members of Glasgow Croporation for failing to support Selby's campaign. The leader of the Labour group on the Council, the Rev. Geoffrey Shaw conceded that there had been an element of complacency about the campaign, though argued that this was among the Labour Party as a whole, rather than just among councillors. MacDonald lost the seat at the February 1974 general election to Selby, who himself stood down after only five years. However, the SNP were able to win seven other seats at the 1974 election, and established themselves as a permanent grouping in the British Parliament.

The Triple Nine Society accepts a minimum qualifying score of 157 (raw) for membership in its ranks, but only if the test was taken prior to 1976. Also, the TNS accepts a minimum qualifying score of 74 from the similar Naval General Classification Test (NGCT), but only from the years 1954–1977.

The Army Alpha and Beta Intelligence Tests Intelligence testing plays a very important role in how school psychologists and special educators evaluate and assess children for placement in special education programs. Many Educational systems in the modern society use the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children to assess the intellectual functioning of children. However, just because intelligence testing is a phenomenon in the education world, the creation of intelligence testing was not intended for educational use. Rather, the first intelligence tests were created during World War I to screen the thousands of soldiers being recruited by the United States Military. Robert Yerkes and a committee of six representatives developed two intelligence tests; the Army Alpha test and the Army Beta test to help the United States Military screen incoming soldiers for \\"intellectual deficiencies, psychopathic tendencies, nervous intangibility, and inadequate self-control\\". The Alpha test was a verbal test for literate recruits and was divided into eight test categories, which included: following oral directions, arithmetical problems, practical judgments, synonyms and antonyms, disarranged sentences, number series completion, analogies and information, whereas the Beta test was a nonverbal test used for testing illiterate or non-English speaking recruits. The Beta test did not require those being tested to use written language, but rather the examinees completed tasks by using visual aids. The Beta Intelligence test was divided into seven subtests, which included: \\"Test 1- assessed the ability of army recruits to trace the path of a maze; Test 2- assessed the ability of cube analysis; Test 3-assessed the ability of pattern analysis using an X-O series; Test 4- assessed the ability of coding digits with symbols; Test 5- assessed the ability of number checking; Test 6-assessed the ability of pictorial completion; and Test 7- assessed the ability of geometrical construction\\". Overall, the Army Alpha and the Army Beta tests were designed to find the mental age of military recruits and to assess incoming recruits for success in the US Military by testing one's ability to understand language, to perform reasoning with semantic and quantitative relationships, to make practical judgments, to infer rules and regulations, and to recall general information. The Army Alpha and the Army Beta tests were heavily criticized for being biased and for not predicting the actual success of incoming soldiers. Nevertheless, Robert Yerkes's innovations in standardized testing and the use of psychometrics to calculate those standardized tests are still seen in intelligence testing today.

Hermes was educated at the Kneiphöfischen Gymnasium. He undertook his Abitur (final examination) at the school in 1866. After completing his secondary education, he studied mathematics from 1866 to 1870, mostly in Königsberg. His studies were interrupted due to his participation in the Franco-Prussian War between 1870 and 1871.  Education  On 14 December 1872, Hermes complete his studies in mathematics earned a degree in mathematics. On 5 April 1879, Hermes received a doctorate degree and his dissertation was on the \\"Reduction of the problem of cyclotomy on linear equations (for prime numbers of the form 2m+1)\\" (German: \\"Zurückführung des Problems der Kreistheilung auf lineare Gleichungen (für Primzahlen von der Form 2m+1)\\").

Legal issues over environmental impact statements and protests from residents of Maui and Kauai temporarily delayed the implementation of service, but service between Oahu and Maui began in December 2007. The company had hoped to return service to Nawiliwili Harbor on Kauai and additionally planned to eventually provide service to Kawaihae Harbor on the Big Island. Ferry operations were suspended in March, 2009 after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that a state law allowing the Superferry to operate without a second complete environmental impact statement was unconstitutional. The company went bankrupt as a result of these actions preventing service in Hawaii. On July 2, 2009 a Delaware Bankruptcy Court granted the company's motion to abandon both the ships Alakai and Huakai, ending all possibilities that the company might return to Hawaii; the ships were bought by the US Maritime Administration in 2010. The United States Navy eventually purchased the craft for a total of $35M, a small fraction of their original $180M cost. Vessels Alakai docking in Honolulu Harbor The vessel used by Hawaii Superferry was an aluminum-hulled catamaran with drive-on / drive-off vehicle capability or fast ferry service. It is designed and built in the United States Mobile, AL by Austal USA, a division of the world's largest fast-ferry builder, Australia-based shipbuilder Austal. The vessel is powered by environmentally clean MTU Friedrichshafen engines running on ultra- low sulfur diesel using waterjet propulsion which the company claimed will minimize impact to marine mammals. It was capable of transporting up to 866 passengers and 282 subcompact cars. The first ship, Alakai, arrived in Honolulu Harbor on June 30, 2007. The second ship, Huakai, was scheduled for completion in 2009, but due to state court ruling halting service, Huakai was abandoned along with Alakai. History An aerial view of Alakai at Nawiliwili Harbor on Kauai during her Open House on August 19, 2007 Private steamships and ferries were the sole way of traveling between the islands from the 19th century until the 1950s and they have returned twice since statehood. The first attempt to re-establish service was the vehicle ferries in 1959-1960s between Oahu, Maui and Big Island -- aboard which surfer Eddie Aikau moved with his family from Maui to Oahu. The second attempt was made by Seaflite, which operated fast 50 knot hydrofoils between the major islands in the mid-1970s. There is currently only one passenger ferry service remaining in Hawaii, from the island of Maui (Lahaina) and Lanai (Manele). The route is operated daily by Expeditions, a company based in Lahaina. The concept of the Superferry was founded in 2001 and first announced by founders Timothy Dick, John Garibaldi, and Robert \\"Terry\\" White in September 2003 after more than two years of planning. Hawaii Superferry stated its plans to operate a daily service between the newly built interisland ferry terminal at Pier 19 in Honolulu Harbor to Kahului on Maui and Nawiliwili on Kauai, with later expansion of service to Kawaihae near Kona on the Big Island. The company claimed fares for a family trip to be similar to the equivalent airfare, car rental, and parking. In January 2004, the company formed a partnership with Austal to build two high-speed catamarans. Construction on the first ship began in June 2004. Meanwhile, the company secured its first investors, including Maui Land & Pineapple Company, Grove Farm on Kauai, and a MARAD loan guarantee of $140 million Inaugural voyage The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled on August 23, 2007 that the state Department of Transportation had erred in not requiring a second environmental impact assessment for harbor improvements at Kahului Harbor, reversing an earlier ruling in 2005 by Maui Circuit Court Judge Joseph Cardoza. Superferry then announced that it would accelerate its launch to August 26, 2007, two days earlier than its originally scheduled launch date. Service began with inaugural $5 fares. The inaugural voyages were sold out. The voyage to Maui was smooth and uneventful with a few environmental protesters observing peacefully at Kahului Harbor. However, about a dozen protesters on surfboards blockaded the ferry at Nawiliwili Harbor on Kauai. The Coast Guard cleared the ferry's path after 90 minutes. Upon docking, protesters vandalized cars and confronted passengers, including Kauai residents. Several protesters were arrested. Suspension of service On August 27, 2007, Judge Cardoza issued a temporary restraining order barring the Superferry from accessing Kahului Harbor, causing Maui service to be suspended. Meanwhile, the Superferry was forced to turn back from its second trip to Kauai after protestors again blockaded the Nawiliwili Harbor resulting in several more arrests. Superferry passengers were forced to remain on board for 9 hours, while Kauai residents were denied the ability to board the ferry. The company subsequently suspended services to Kauai. The protesters' concerns were that a ferry of this size traveling at speeds of about could strike and kill whales during its voyages despite this never occurring during the years the faster (50 mph) Seaflite interisland ferries operated. Other concerns included the potential to import invasive species between islands, and the potential to bring drugs and homeless people to Kauai although it is unclear whether such risk was any different from the interisland airlines. In a meeting with State Senate President Colleen Hanabusa on September 14, 2007, the company stated that it may have to find another home for the ferry in order to pay operating expenses, repay debt, and provide return on the investments made. Describing their meeting, Hanabusa commented that they would have staying power for \\"a month—outside, a month and a half.\\" Superferry officials, while declining to elaborate, did not dispute this. On October 9, 2007 Maui Judge Joseph Cardoza ruled the ferry could not resume service while the state conducts an environmental impact assessment. Two days later Superferry CEO John Garibaldi announced that the company would lay off 249 employees. Fifty-nine workers remained on the job to handle administrative and operational duties. The maritime community was disturbed by the loss of jobs for U.S. mariners. Special legislative session In mid October 2007, Governor Linda Lingle met with the leaders of the Hawaii State Legislature to propose a special legislative session to allow the ferry to operate while the state completed an environmental impact assessment. Senate and House leaders agreed. Governor Lingle called the Legislature into special session on October 24, 2007. In preparation for the session, legislators made trips to Kauai, Maui, and The Big Island to get reactions. On Kauai, the meeting was calm, but on Maui the meeting was more emotionally charged.Maui Meeting Gets Heated On Monday October 29, 2007 the State Senate approved a bill to allow \\"large capacity ferry vessels\\" to operate between ports in the Hawaiian Islands while an environmental statement is prepared. The House passed the bill on October 31 on a vote of 39-11.House gives final OK to Hawaii Superferry bill Governor Lingle signed the bill into law on November 2, 2007. Restarting service On Wednesday November 14, 2007, Maui Court Judge Cardoza lifted the injunction banning the ferry from sailing to Kahului Harbor consistent with the new law. Hawaii Superferry's CEO John Garibaldi released this statement: \\"On behalf of Hawaii Superferry's family of employees, we are pleased with the judge's decision today. We are grateful for the support shown by the governor, legislature, and residents of Hawaii and look forward to commencing service soon.\\" Superferry restarted daily round trip service to Maui on December 14. Re-suspension of service In December 2008, environmental groups and the company returned to court for an appeal of the previous ruling. On March 16, 2009 the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that allowing the Superferry to operate prior to completion of the environmental study was unconstitutional.Sierra Club v. Dep't of Transp., 120 Hawai\`i 181, 202 P.3d 1226 (2009) The company immediately suspended service and laid off its 236 employees.Many affected by loss of Hawaii Superferry Bankruptcy On May 30, 2009, two months after suspending service, Hawaii Superferry filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection.Hawaii Superferry files for bankruptcyHawaii Superferry Goes Bankrupt The company would then abandon the vessels ending all possibilities to return service. Revival attempts On February 8, 2010 state lawmakers announced the introduction of a bill that would buy or lease both Alakai and Huakai and possibly start a state-run ferry service; the bill was killed two months later. The revival resurfaced in July 2010 when former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann introduced a \\"10-point action plan to boost the state's economy if he is elected governor.\\" Hannemann said he was in talks with a group of investors interested in buying both Alakai and Huakai. On March 21, 2011, the Hawaii State senate committee approved a planned proposal to establish a state-run ferry authority with the power to borrow money and purchase a high- speed ferry for interisland service. House Bill 1239, introduced by state Rep. Joe Souki of Maui, would set up the Hawaii State Ferry System and a special fund for its operation. However, there were mixed reaction as to how it will be structured and to how it will be run.\\"Senate committee approves measure for state-run ferries\\" from Honolulu Star-Advertiser (March 22, 2011) On February 4, 2016, the Honolulu Advertiser reported that lawmakers have directed the Department of Transportation to conduct a feasibility study to establish a ferry system.

He was actively involved and proactive in literary and intellectual circles of Kabul. He was a co-ordinator of the first congress of People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the first main leftist democratic party in Afghanistan. He left the party in 1967 after the membership of Hafizullah Amin who had a suspected prehistory of ethno-centric chauvinist activities in the south of the country and recently returned from the United States. He arranged a circle named \\"Mahfele Entezar\\" (Waiting circle) movement and later the \\"Revolutionary Organisation of Workers of Afghanistan\\" or SAZA Political movement, speaking out for the basic political rights for all citizens and for improvement of economic and educational conditions of the people.  Ideas  There has been little systematic and systemic research on core ideas and thoughts of Taher Badakhshi in recent years. The lack of serious academic studies on his legacy is remarkable. This epistemic void might be caused by different factors. Rarely you will find any university in the Western hemisphere performing systematic research on modernism in Afghanistan with the specific focus on the liberal, ideas of liberalism, the heterogeneous leftist movements there and, on the contextualization of the relevant events since 1945 till end of the century. This obvious research gap of academic institutions in the Western hemisphere seems to be the real world insight of the protagonist and experts, especially when it comes to the pivotal and formative years between 1955 and 1975. On has to express the amazement why Western academia has been neglecting the real world dynamics of the intellectual history of the liberal, ideas of liberalism, the heterogeneous leftist movements in Afghanistan. Recently there has been founded a \\"Taher Badakhshi Institute\\" exactly to cover up a significant epistemic gap in research on of the liberal, ideas of liberalism, the heterogeneous leftist movements in Afghanistan. The institute has gathered a significant body of evidence, including the political memories of Taher Badakhshi and most significant writings and will consecutively publish them in order to create a new field of research on a specific version of modernisms in Afghanistan. The research, so the scholars of the institute, will be designed, \\"to measure the real world outcome on four levels. First level will contain relevant general statements and targeted and specific information on the notion of modernism. A version of modernism in a national geographic framework that is called Afghanistan and on a historic spotlight that encompasses South & West as well Central Asia (according to the UNESCO). Second level will contain a body of ideas, ideologies and policies in AFG between 1945 and 2017 that had been related to the liberal and liberalism with all their implications and variations. Not the superficial term of a \\"liberal\\" group or organization is meant here, but ideas based on the notion of principle justice, political emancipation and freedom as such and in AFG. Ideologies backing liberal connotations and struggles and, ultimately, those policies leading to a certain degree of statehood/nationhood, justice and freedom. A certain degree means any fine and discrete difference had been made by these ideas, ideologies and policies. Third level will contain the notion of the left/leftist movements that are, of course, the peak of any liberal understanding and liberalism aiming and desiring principle justice, political emancipation and freedom as such and in Afghanistan. Fourth level will be explicitly concentrated on ideas, communications and actions of Taher Badakhshi. Why Taher Badakhshi, because there is today, under the current circumstances in Afghanistan, and because of the peculiar conditions there, an urgent need to do so, to recapitulate and to revise his ideas, communications and actions from the 1960s until his violent disappearance in 1979.\\"  Politics  The main political background was built by third world freedom movements like in Vietnam, Palestine, or African anti-colonial fights and it was orientated on Non-Aligned Movement. The political activities between 1965 and 1978 were mainly focussed on basic reformative goals toward a liberal (republican and democratic) system in which basic human rights of all inhabitants of the country, independent of their ethnic or economic background, would be respected. A special regard was concentrated on the obvious and objective antagonism of ethnic disparity and inequality in favour of Pashtuns and, in evident disfavor of other ethnic groups as they are Uzbeks, Hazaras and to some extent even Tajiks. Activities were directed against the Pashtun ethnic-dominance and elitism in relevant fields of politics, finance, military, police; asking for equal rights of all other ethnicities in Afghanistan. The political organization he led was labeled as Setami Milli (National Oppression) by the royal family and, at the same time, by the \\"leftist\\" functionaries, mainly by Pashtun activists of the \\"People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan\\". He came because of his opposition to the system into political detention many times in his life, for days, weeks or multiple months: during the times of King Zahir Shah, during the first republic of Muhammad Daoud. In the meantime, he worked in the Ministry of Education, where he kept working during the regime of Nur Muhammad Taraki after the leftist coup d état in April 1978 too. His cultural work and productivity in terms of writing multiple newspapers, journals and magazines on poetry, prose, philosophy and theology had been documented well, but mostly got lost in the years of the war that came after 1980. The theoretical work done by Taher Badakhshi in the meantime extended from poetry and prose to solid concepts of political thinking and action that are yet in urgent need to be studied. Experts in area studies from the Global North (or the Western hemisphere) are at the beginning of research.  Legacy  His political and theoretical legacy in the years to come experienced heterogeneous transformation, often by good will or by theoretical misunderstandings, it remains still a current issue in the politics and concepts of politics in Afghanistan. The memorials for his legacy take place each year in the country by local and regional personalities and outside of the country by diaspora intellegentia. The last large-scale event in 2017 took in Canada and Afghanistan.

Biography  John Billings was born in Melbourne and was educated at Xavier College, and at the University of Melbourne where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree. In 1953, he began work on a method of natural family planning, involving observation of several indicators of fertility and infertility, gradually focusing on the changes to cervical mucus patterns of sensation. His wife, Evelyn, became involved from 1963. The couple founded the World Organisation of the Ovulation Method Billings (WOOMB) as the body responsible for teaching the method throughout the world. Although Billings maintained his career as a consulting neurologist to St Vincent's Hospital, he and his wife spent a large part of each year traveling to other countries, and training teachers in the Billings Ovulation Method, lecturing to doctors and students, and establishing teaching centers. The Method pioneered by the Billings was approved by both the Catholic Church and used by the World Health Organization. It was the only natural method accepted by the Chinese Government. Honours In 1969, John Billings was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great (KCSG) by Pope Paul VI. In 2003, Pope John Paul II added a star to this papal knighthood (KC*SG). He was also made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1991. In 2003, Evelyn Billings was made a Dame Commander of the Order of St Gregory the Great.

Set during the reign of Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys (died 1160), its composition is typically dated to somewhere between the late 12th through the late 14th century.Stephenson, David, Medieval Powys: Kingdom, Principality and Lordships, 1132-1293, Boydell & Brewer, 2016, pp. 306-310. It survives in only one manuscript, the Red Book of Hergest, and has been associated with the Mabinogion since its publication by Lady Charlotte Guest in the 19th century. The bulk of the narrative describes a dream vision experienced by its central character, Rhonabwy, a retainer of Madog, in which he visits the time of King Arthur. Narrative The frame story tells that Madog sends Rhonabwy and two companions to find the prince's rebellious brother Iorwerth. One night during the pursuit they seek shelter with Heilyn the Red, but find his longhouse filthy and his beds full of fleas. Lying down on a yellow ox-skin, Rhonabwy experiences a dream of Arthur and his time. Serving as his guide is one of Arthur's followers, Iddawg the Churn of Britain, so called because he sparked the Battle of Camlann when he distorted the king's messages of peace he was supposed to deliver to the enemy Medrawd (Mordred). Iddawg introduces Rhonabwy and his friends to Arthur, who regrets that Wales has been inherited by such tiny men. Iddawg reveals that Arthur's men are assembled to meet the Saxons at the Battle of Mount Badon. However, Arthur is more concerned with a game of gwyddbwyll (a chess-like board game) he is playing against his follower Owain mab Urien (Ywain). While they play, messengers arrive declaring that Arthur's squires are attacking Owain's ravens; when Owain asks that this be stopped Arthur only responds, \\"your move\\". Finally Owain orders his ravens to attack Arthur's servants; when Arthur asks him to call them off, Owain says \\"your move, lord\\". Eventually Arthur crushes the chess pieces into dust, and the two declare peace between their forces. After this the Saxons send a contingent asking for a truce, which Arthur grants after consulting his advisors. Cai (Kay) declares that any who wish to follow Arthur should come to Cornwall. The noise of the troops moving wakes Rhonabwy, who realizes he has slept for three days. Interpretation There is no consensus about the ultimate meaning of The Dream of Rhonabwy. On one hand it derides Madoc's time, which is critically compared to the illustrious Arthurian age. However, Arthur's time is portrayed as illogical and silly, leading to suggestions that this is a satire on both contemporary times and the myth of a heroic age.Roberts, Brynley F. (1991). \\"The Dream of Rhonabwy.\\" In Lacy, Norris J., The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, p. 120–121. New York: Garland. . Rhonabwy is the most literary of the medieval Welsh prose tales; it may have also been the last written. A colophon at the end declares that no one is able to recite the work in full without a book, the level of detail being too much for the memory to handle. The comment suggests the work was not popular with storytellers, though this was more likely due to its position as a literary tale rather than a traditional one.

Recycling timber is a practice that was popularized in the early 1990s as issues such as deforestation and climate change prompted both timber suppliers and consumers to turn to a more sustainable timber source. Recycling timber is the environmentally friendliest form of timber production and is very common in countries such as Australia and New Zealand where supplies of old wooden structures are plentiful. Timber can be chipped down into wood chips which can be used to power homes or power plants. Benefits Example of recycled timber as a final product Recycling timber has become popular due to its image as an environmentally friendly product. Common belief among consumers is that by purchasing recycled wood, the demand for \\"green timber\\" will fall and ultimately benefit the environment. Greenpeace also view recycled timber as an environmentally friendly product, citing it as the most preferable timber source on their website. The arrival of recycled timber as a construction product has been important in both raising industry and consumer awareness towards deforestation and promoting timber mills to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. Recycling one ton of wood can save up to 18,000,000 btus of energy. Drawbacks Some hurdles facing the widespread adoption of recycled timber: sometimes the ends of wall studs need to be trimmed off to stop decay and cracking, thus resulting in a shorter piece of wood; this trimming may result in pieces of wood that do not meet building codes. Though the price may be less than for new wood, the process of selecting usable pieces of salvaged wood, pulling out nails, and refinishing for a new use can be laborious and time-consuming. Demolition must happen in such a way as to preserve as much of the timber as possible in a building, which means more time spent dismantling a building rather than just tearing it down quickly. The trade in recycled timber is not well-established everywhere, so a reliable supply of usable wood may be hard to come by for builders. There may be a stigma associated with using \\"used\\" or \\"cheap\\" wood that is perceived to be of not as high quality as \\"new\\" wood. Not all pieces of wood in a dismantled building will fit in a new building, and it may be cheaper and easier, from a design and labor perspective, to simply get new wood (ex: wood from a 6-foot (1.8 m) deck being used in a 7-foot (2.1 m) deck). Of course, none of these issues are insurmountable, and they are issues of convenience and logistics rather than structural integrity, but many builders find it easier and less time-consuming to simply get new wood in standard uniform sizes. Recycling timber Trat, Thailand, is applied to make a new roof. Recycled timber most commonly comes from old buildings, bridges and wharfs, where it is carefully stripped out and put aside by demolishers. At the same time any usable dimension stone is set aside for reuse. The demolishers then sell the salvaged timber to merchants who then re-mill the timber by manually scanning it with a metal detector, which allows the timber to be de-nailed and sawn to size. Once re-milled the timber is commonly sold to consumers in the form of timber flooring, beams and decking. Examples Use of recycling timber is not new. As early as 1948, the 100 metre tall tower of Golm transmitter near Potsdam, Germany was built from recycled timber. It stood for 31 years. It was common to reuse wood of dismantled radio towers in the 1930s in Germany, e.g. the former tower of Koblenz radio transmitter was built of wood from a dismantled tower, which carried a T-antenna at Transmitter Muehlacker. The upper parts of the 157-metre-tall wood tower of Ismaning radio transmitter, which stood for 49 years, were built of wood from a smaller radio tower dismantled in 1934.

For example, a right-handed pull hitter, who bats from the left side of the plate, will usually hit the ball to the left side of the field, termed \\"left field\\", from the batter's perspective. The opposite of pull hitting is known as \\"hitting to the opposite field.\\" Hitters who rarely hit to the opposite field or \\"up the middle\\" are often described as dead pull hitters. Shifting When a pull hitter with a high batting average is at the plate, it is common for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive tactic known as \\"shifting,\\" moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field to which the batter usually hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the increase in likelihood of the batter's hitting to that side of the field. For a left-handed power hitter such as the Chicago White Sox' Harold Baines or the Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full \\"shift\\" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second basemen, usually in shallow right field; the left fielder in left- center or center field; and the center fielder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call for the opposite shift when a strong right- handed pull hitter is at bat for the opposing team.

It tells Emily Ebers's side of the story in Stanford Wong Flunks Big-Time and Millicent Min, Girl Genius.  Plot  Moving is not a pleasant experience- especially moving to the other side of the country with a moody mother who insists on stopping at every museum along the way. The road from Allendale, New Jersey, to Rancho Rosetta, California, is not a smooth one for fun-loving Emily Ebers. The only reason she had to move was because her parents divorced, and it was all because of Alice, her boring journalist mother. It was she who wanted to divorce, to tear the family apart, and to sell the house that Emily loved. Alice definitely cares about Emily. Emily only chose to live with Alice because if she lived with her father, she would get in his way- and the way of his band, Talky Boys, which is touring the East Coast. Just when her summer looked like it couldn't get any worse, Emily is signed up for volleyball by Alice. During these torture sessions, Emily must learn to hit the ball over the net, live with the awful Coach Gowin, and endure and reflect insults from popular girl, Julie and her \\"back-up singers.\\" However, in a twist of fate, she meets Millicent Min, a home-schooled Chinese girl who was forced to play volleyball because there wasn't a gym at home. Surprisingly, Millie and Emily become best friends instantly, and Millie even goes to Emily's for a sleepover. But here's where the problem arises- is it possible for Alice to dematerialize so that her ugly hippie clothing and boring talk about journalism doesn't embarrass Emily? Luckily, Millie fakes interest in Alice and is safely whisked off to Emily's room before Alice can drone on about her newest articles. After this sleepover, everything gets even better for Emily. First, she meets the other Mins- Mr. and Mrs. Min and Grandma Maddie- who are actually normal humans, unlike Alice. Then, she meets the boy of her dreams- Stanford Wong, who is athletic, smart, and handsome. He's the only seventh grader on the A-team for basketball, Millie's tutor, and someone that would \\"never do anything to hurt anyone.\\" Emily's life is now back to normal, and even volleyball isn't so excruciating as it first was now that she has Millie. However, everything she didn't give a second thought about now comes back to her- why Millie used large words and carried a briefcase, why she was so uncomfortable talking about school, and why another girl on the volleyball team calls her a \\"genius\\". During the morning of a sleepover at Millie's, Emily uncovers everything she needs to know to fit the pieces of the puzzle together- trophies, plaques, certificates, diplomas, and newspaper articles labeled 'Millicent Min'. She realizes that Millicent isn't stupid, homeschooled, or tutored by Stanford Wong. She is a genius, whereas Stanford Wong is failing language arts. \\"Best friends don't lie to each other,\\" she thinks. How could they have lied to her the entire time? Disgusted with her \\"friends,\\" Emily decides to start anew and find real buddies who won't lie to her. First, she decides to become closer to Wendy, the other nice girl in volleyball. Through Wendy, she learns about Julie and her back up singers- how they could either \\"make or break\\" Emily when she started school. Though she isn't the type to join the popular clique, Wendy encourages her to start school with a good reputation. Plus, being popular can't harm her, can it? Thus, the two of them attend Julie's pedicure party (popular girls only) where Emily is encouraged to look at herself in a different way- that is, comparing themselves to ultra- thin models. Emily starts dieting (though she isn't fat) and plucking her eyebrows (though they aren't ugly). In this quest to find out who she really is, Emily is pressured to buy six identical purses, $112 each, for each of the six popular girls (Julie and her Triple A backup singers Alyssa, Ariel, and Ariana, plus Emily and Wendy) with her dad's credit card. That day, Emily not only spent $672 (plus tax), but also one of her final tokens of tolerance for the so-called popular clique. Though Wendy is a nice girl, no one beats Millie's \\"deadpan sense of humor\\" and the way she always had something to talk about. The timing was always perfect for Millie and Emily. Luckily, it still is. In an awkward telephone conversation, the two former best friends decide to meet at the mall. Though it takes some time for Millie to figure out that she had not \\"sorely misjudged the dynamics\\" of their relationship, but rather misjudged Emily's ability to look beyond IQ, she does figure out that Emily was and will always be her friend despite the intellectual barrier that had caused Millie to be friendless in the first place. With Millie back, Emily is able to face the fact that her dad is no father of the year. When he finally calls for the second time the entire summer, it's about the credit card, to \\"confirm the purchase of six [expensive] purses\\" and to tell Emily to stop using the credit card. Emily is heartbroken; she had believed that her father had been extremely busy with his band and that he still loved her very much. Fortunately, when the truth hits her, Millie is right next to her, handing her tissues. But that's not all that Millie does- she even asks for the makeover that Emily's always wanted to do to cheer Millie up. Emily also finds out that Alice had turned down a prestigious assignment to Paris, just to be with her for the summer! After realizing her serious error, Emily apologizes to her mother, saying, \\"I'm so sorry,...about this summer and life and everything. I've been so mean to you.\\" Finally, after an entire summer, Emily is able to engage in an intimate relationship with her mother who she doesn't call \\"Alice\\" anymore, but \\"mom\\"- short, sweet, and daughterly. After Millie's perfect definition of \\"true friend\\" in that noble act, Emily is able to break her bonds with Julie and the Triple A's. \\"I may have been slow, but I finally figured out what a true friend is, and Julie never was one,\\" she declares. When Julie attempts to persuade Emily that what she has been doing for Emily is all for Emily's own good (e.g. the dieting), even meek Wendy sticks up for Emily. With one more true friend, Julie can't break her in school. That's another problem solved and just one more to go. Although Stanford called almost every day, he never said anything or left a message. He never apologized, and Emily thinks it's because he never liked her. However, several days before summer vacation ends, the two make it up to each other. In an ice cream shop, Emily kisses Stanford on the cheek and they become boyfriend and girlfriend. And finally, with a sweet letter to her father, Emily completes her diary. She is finally \\"home\\", as wise old Maddie says. External links *Lisa Yee's Official Website *So Totally Emily Ebers Official Website on Arthur A.

Peggy Lee recorded the song on November 25, 1947, with Dave Barbour's orchestra as backing. Released by Capitol Records (catalog number 15022), it became her biggest chart hit. For the week ending January 23, 1948, the single entered Billboard's Best Sellers chart, where it spent 21 weeks, nine of those at number one. Mañana is Spanish for \\"tomorrow\\" (though it also means \\"morning\\"). The theme of the humorous song is the singer wanting to put off urgent tasks until the next day. The song is typically performed with stereotypical Hispanic accents, and with a Latin flavor to the backup band. Lee's autobiography emphasized that the song was her portrait of a single happy-go-lucky individual, written during a relaxing Mexican vacation, and she regretted that some listeners perceived it as cultural mockery. Notable covers The following artists have covered the song: * The Mills Brothers recorded the song on December 31, 1947 for Decca Records (catalog No. 24333).

Normally, through a process called fatty acid oxidation, several enzymes work in a step-wise fashion to metabolize fats and convert them to energy. People with 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency have inadequate levels of an enzyme required for a step that metabolizes groups of fats called medium chain fatty acids and short chain fatty acids; for this reason this disorder is sometimes called medium- and short-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (M/SCHAD) deficiency. Signs and symptoms Typically, initial signs and symptoms of this disorder occur during infancy or early childhood and can include poor appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, liver problems, and hyperinsulinism (high levels of insulin). Insulin controls the amount of sugar that moves from the blood into cells for conversion to energy. Individuals with 3-hydroxyacyl- coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency are also at risk for complications such as seizures, life-threatening heart and breathing problems, coma, and sudden unexpected death. Problems related to 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency can be triggered by periods of fasting or by illnesses such as viral infections. This disorder is sometimes mistaken for Reye syndrome, a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. Most cases of Reye syndrome are associated with the use of aspirin during these viral infections. Genetics Mutations in the HADH gene lead to inadequate levels of an enzyme called 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase. Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized and processed properly without sufficient levels of this enzyme. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to characteristic features of this disorder, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the liver, heart, and muscles, causing more serious complications. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder each carry one copy of the altered gene but do not show signs and symptoms of the disorder.

The sensors, called transducers, can pick up speech even in extremely noisy or windy environments, such as on a motorcycle or in a nightclub. Other types of microphones do not function well under these conditions because of high levels of background noise. Advanced laryngophones are able to pick up whispers, and therefore perform well in environments where communicating with others at a distance in silence is required, such as during covert military or law enforcement operations. Throat microphones are also very useful when helmets or respiratory protection is required. Many full-face SCBA, CABA, SAR respirator, PAPR, or re-breather masks do not have a provision for a microphone inside the mask. The throat microphone can be used safely, as it is positioned outside the mask's face seal and as such does not compromise the respiratory protection provided by the mask, nor does it violate mask approvals and certification.  History  In 1934, aviator Wiley Post incorporated earphones and a throat mic into the design of the world's first pressure suit to explore the limits of high-altitude, long-distance flight. During World War II, German Luftwaffe pilotsReitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, and panzer crews used the first throat microphones. Soon after, they were adopted by the Allied air forces—the USAAF with the T-20 and T-30 and the RAF with the Mark II. Later, Soviet pilots relied on LA-3 and LA-5 models. Starting in the 1970s, researchers explored the use of throat microphones in speech therapy, especially to relieve stuttering. Throat microphones have maintained their presence in the military, law enforcement, and emergency services. Newer single-transducer designs are available that make the throat microphone much more comfortable to wear than earlier units and also better balance transmission quality. Additionally, this next generation of throat microphones provides varying outputs and frequency responses to accommodate a wide variety of professional communication devices such as digital and analog portable radios and Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) and P25 systems. Several throat microphones now exist for mobile devices.

Early life  Jones was born in Fort Monroe, Virginia. At a young age he moved with his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he completed his early education. Returning to Virginia, he took up studies at Norfolk Mission College and a year later went to complete his education at Virginia Union University, though he did not graduate.  Police career  Jones began service with the Washington Metropolitan Police Department in January 1905. He rose from being a footman to a horseman then a motorcycle policeman. His work resulted in being promoted to detective. During this time he and his wife Ethel T. (Peters) Jones became the parents of three children. Their son John B. Jones was born in 1910. Another son, Amos W. Jones, was born in 1911. Their daughter Mildred Theodora Jones was born in 1915.  Military exploits  In 1917 Jones joined the United States Army. He attended the Officers' Training School in Des Moines, Iowa, and once his training was complete he was given a commission as a Captain. He was assigned to the 368th Infantry Regiment (United States), 92nd Division, in command of Company F. After his company was sent to France in 1918, he saw action in the Vosges Mountains, Argonne Sector, and the Metz front. During that time he became an instructor with the 92nd Division School of Specialists. His work there resulted in his being promoted to senior instructor. With the war's end in 1918 he resigned his post and resumed his work at the Metropolitan Police.  FBI and Marcus Garvey  Jones's application to join the FBI Jones was appointed as the first African-American special agent on November 19, 1919, by Bureau of Investigation director A. Bruce Bielaski. Jones was assigned to a new section of the Justice Department created to track the activities of groups perceived as subversive. His work there was under the direct supervision of J. Edgar Hoover. During his time in the FBI, Jones served in New York City and Pittsburgh. In New York he was assigned to infiltrate the Universal Negro Improvement Association under the leadership of Marcus Garvey. Although he was seeking evidence of subversive activities during the \\"Red Scare\\" of 1919, Jones' work led to the arrest and trial of Garvey on mail fraud charges. While conducting his surveillance, Jones adopted the code number 800 for his reports, and was also known as agent \\"800\\". He apparently knew that his clandestine role was not well concealed. During a March 1920 speech at the UNIA Liberty Hall he took special pains to point out to the audience that he was indeed of African ancestry, although he had the appearance of a person of Caucasian or European ancestry. Nevertheless, he engendered the trust of the UNIA leadership to such an extent that he was able to gain responsibility for registering all incoming correspondence. His access to UNIA correspondence along with his position as Adjutant General in the African Legion were essential in enabling his information gathering activities. In August 1921 Jones began conducting similar surveillance on the African Blood Brotherhood. Eventually recognized as an ex-police officer, Jones was no longer an asset as a clandestine agent and he resigned from the Bureau on April 14, 1923. Jones died on December 11, 1958, in Dormont, Pennsylvania. Further reading *Athan G. Theoharis, The FBI: A Comprehensive Reference Guide, 1998 (409 pages), p. 335. *Robert A.

In August 2008, Yemen’s Interior Minister Mutahar al-Masri supported the launch of a new feature film to educate the public about the consequences of Islamist extremism. The Losing Bet was produced by Fadl al- Olfi. The plot follows two Yemeni jihadis, who return from years living abroad.

It is a double album comprising songs recorded between 1998 and New Year's Eve 1999/2000. It was Hornsby's first album with his touring act the Noisemakers. The album not only captures the ambience of one of Hornsby’s concerts, but also reflects the vibrant temperament and true stylistic diversity with which he approaches his craft, treating the live performance like a journey in search of the perfect musical moment. With this album, Hornsby is determined to create a hybrid style that encompasses rock, jazz, and classical music within a jam band mentality. The concert musical experience captured on the album embodied the gestures towards complete improvisatory musical spontaneity and towards recasting old songs as unrecognizably new that so much of Hornsby's solo work had been forecasting, this time in a full band setting. The album covers pieces by many of Hornsby's musical influences, George Gershwin, Samuel Barber, Bill Evans, Bud Powell and Bob Dylan among them. Hornsby directly acknowledges the influence of the Grateful Dead by performing their songs \\"Lady with a Fan\\" and \\"Black Muddy River\\" and by including a version of \\"The Valley Road\\" that seems to have \\"emerged from the Grateful Dead's \\"Wharf Rat.\\" Track listing All songs by Bruce Hornsby, except where noted.

The first Flemings stores were opened in 1930 by Jim Fleming Sr. and George Fleming. They initially traded under the name \\"E.L. Lakin\\". Following World War II, the name changed to \\"Fleming's Fabulous Food Stores\\" and there were 100 stores. In June 1960, Jim Fleming Jr. and his father sold their 55 Flemings stores to Woolworths Limited for $10 million. In the early 1970s, Jim Fleming Jr. acquired Warman's Stores in New South Wales. Fleming gave it a new name, Jewel Food Stores, and pushed it into the same discount end of the grocery retailing business as Flemings. The final \\"Flemings Food Stores\\" logo was launched in the early 1990s . From the late 1990s, Flemings stores were internally rebranded to Woolworths featuring the same marketing materials and the same home brand products. The external branding didn't change until the late 2000s. Some Flemings stores closed and the remaining were rebranded as Woolworths or Woolworths Metro. The last of these were the Pendle Hill store which was refurbished and rebranded Woolworths in late 2009. Umina Beach on the Central Coast closed on 17 June 2010 and was replaced by a Woolworths, opposite the old Flemings store. The Bexley North store was rebadged as a Woolworths Metro store in 2017. The last Flemings store in Jannali closed on 19 May 2020 and was replaced by a Woolworths Metro.

It oversees handling of record labels assigned to UMG's Capitol Records division and was inherited from its acquisition of EMI's catalog [with the exception of Parlophone, which was sold to Warner Music Group (WMG) in 2013]. It is one of five umbrella labels owned by UMG, the other four being Interscope Geffen A&M;, Island Records, Def Jam Recordings, and Republic Records. Labels distributed under the CMG brand include Capitol Records, EMI Records, Virgin Records, Motown Records, Blue Note Records, Astralwerks, Harvest Records, Capitol Christian Music Group, Priority Records, Atom Factory Entertainment, and Deep Well Records. History The Capitol Music Group's headquarters are located at the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood. Capitol Music Group was formed in February 2007 as a merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records America in an effort by EMI to restructure and save an average of $217 million yearly. Both Virgin Records and Capitol Records, however, remained imprints of the label. Virgin Records CEO Jason Flom was named the head of the division, with Capitol Records CEO Andy Slater resigning after receiving a pension reportedly worth more than $15 million. As the head of the label, Flom reported directly to EMI Group CEO Eric Nicoli. A total of 283 artists signed to Capitol Music Group, including Mims, LeToya Luckett, J. Holiday, Royal Bliss, Mack 10, Faith Evans, Fat Joe, and since 2007, Katy Perry, Ferras, and Rucka Rucka Ali. In 2014 both Morrissey and Neil Diamond were confirmed to have signed with Capitol Records, Morrissey having signed a two-album deal. However, the latter was given to Parlophone as a result of that label's sale to Warner Music. In 2010, Virgin Records was spun off from Capitol Music Group to form Virgin Music Group; as of 2013, however, the Virgin Music Group was dissolved, resulting in Virgin Records returning to its placement under CMG. In November 2012, it was announced that Steve Barnett would become the chairman and CEO of the company. With EMI's absorption (sans Parlophone) into Universal Music Group complete, Capitol Music Group is now part of UMG's five label units in the UK. The Beatles have been confirmed to appear on Capitol UK. In April 2013, Robbie McIntosh was named head of Capitol's international operations. In November 2016, the company's chairman and CEO Steve Barnett announced that the company has three endeavors planned out that include music, film and literary projects that pay tribute to eight decades' worth of artists signed to the label.

The greater the quantity delivered, the larger the dose. Doses are most commonly measured for compounds in medicine. The term is usually applied to the quantity of a drug or other agent administered for therapeutic purposes, but may be used to describe any case where a substance is introduced to the body. In nutrition, the term is usually applied to how much of a specific nutrient is in a person's diet or in a particular food, meal, or dietary supplement. For bacterial or viral agents, dose typically refers to the amount of the pathogen required to infect a host. For information on dosage of toxic substances, see Toxicology. For information on excessive intake of pharmaceutical agents, see Drug overdose. In clinical pharmacology, dose refers to dosage or amount of dose administered to a person, whereas exposure means the time-dependent concentration (often in the circulatory blood or plasma) or concentration-derived parameters such as AUC (area under the concentration curve) and Cmax (peak level of the concentration curve) of the drug after its administration. This is in contrast to their interchangeable use in other fields.  Factors affecting dose  A ‘dose’ of any chemical or biological agent (active ingredient) has several factors which are critical to its effectiveness. The first is concentration, that is, how much of the agent is being administered to the body at once. Another factor is the duration of exposure. Some drugs or supplements have a slow-release feature in which portions of the medication are metabolized at different times, which changes the impacts the active ingredients have on the body. Some substances are meant to be taken in small doses over large periods of time to maintain a constant level in the body, while others are meant to have a large impact once and be expelled from the body after its work is done. It's entirely dependent on the function of the drug or supplement. The route of administration is important as well. Whether a drug is ingested orally, injected into a muscle or vein, absorbed through a mucous membrane, or any of the other types of administration routes, affects how quickly the substance will be metabolized by the body and thus effects the concentration of the active ingredient(s). Dose-response curves may illustrate the relationship of these metabolic effects.  Medicines = Over-the-counter medications  In over-the-counter medicines, dosage is based on age. Typically, different doses are recommended for children 6 years and under, children aged 6 to 12 years, and persons 12 years and older, but outside of those ranges the guidance is slim. This can lead to serial under or overdosing, as smaller people take more than they should and larger people take less. Over-the- counter medications are typically accompanied by a set of instructions directing the patient to take a certain small dose, followed by another small dose if their symptoms don't subside. Under-dosing is a common problem in pharmacy, as predicting an average dose that is effective for all individuals is extremely challenging because body weight and size impacts how the dose acts within the body.  Prescription drugs  Prescription drug dosage is based typically on body weight.http://www.lahc.edu/classes/nursing/nurs302/chapter14.pdf Drugs come with a recommended dose in milligrams or micrograms per kilogram of body weight, and that is used in conjunction with the patient's body weight to determine a safe dosage. In single dosage scenarios, the patient's body weight and the drug's recommended dose per kilogram are used to determine a safe one- time dose. In drugs where multiple doses of treatment are needed in a day, the physician must take into account information regarding the total amount of the drug which is safe to use in one day, and how that should be broken up into intervals for the most effective treatment for the patient. Medication underdosing occurs commonly when physicians write prescriptions for a dosage that is correct for a certain time, but fails to increase the dosage as the patient needs (i.e. weight based dosing in children, or increasing dosages of chemotherapy drugs if a patient's condition worsens).  Medical cannabis  Medical cannabis is used to treat the symptoms of a wide variety of diseases and conditions. The dose of cannabis depends on the individual, the condition being treated, and the ratio of cannabidiol (CBD) to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the cannabis. CBD is a chemical component of cannabis that is not intoxicating and used to treat conditions like epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric disorders. THC is a chemical component of cannabis that is psychoactive. It has been used to treat nausea and discomfort in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment. For anxiety, depression, and other mental health ailments, a CBD to THC ratio of 10 to 1 is recommended.https://www.projectcbd.org/sites/projectcbd/files/downloads/pcbd_dosingguide_2-12-2015_2.pdf For cancer and neurological conditions, a CBD to THC ratio of 1 to 1 is recommended. The correct dosage for a patient is dependent on their individual reaction to both chemicals, and therefore the dosing must be continually adjusted once treatment is initiated to find the right balance. There is limited consensus throughout the scientific community regarding the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis.  Cancer  Calculating drug dosages for treatment for more serious diseases like cancer is commonly done through measuring the Body Surface Area of the patient. There are approximately 25 different formulae for measuring a patient's body surface area, none of them exact. See also Body surface area. Because of the variety of methods to select when determining a patient's body surface area, studies show that choosing the best method for an individual patient is a difficult task, and often a patient receives too much or too little medication based on physical anomalies that don't necessarily fit perfectly with the portfolio of the body surface area. Because these methods are inexact, they are typically adjusted by what's known as ‘toxicity-adjusting dosing’ where physicians monitor the immune suppression and adjust dosing according to the results to minimize either under and overdosing. This trial-and-error method has been shown to be risky to the patient and costly to healthcare companies, as well as inefficient, because of the constant monitoring that is required. Research is occurring constantly to develop new dosing methods that are more accurate and safe for the consumer.  Ongoing research  Another approach that's been investigated recently is dosing on a molecular level, either through conventional delivery systems, nanoparticle delivery, light-triggered delivery, or other less known/used methods. By combining these drugs with a system that detects the concentration of drug particles in the blood, proper dosing could be achieved for each individual patient. Research in this field was initiated with monitoring of small-molecule cocaine levels in undiluted blood serum with electrochemical aptamer-based sensing. DNA aptamers, which are peptides that have with specific target molecules that they search for, fold in response to the molecule when they find it, and this technology was used in a microfluidic detection system to create an electrochemical signal that physicians can read. Researchers tested it on cocaine detection and found that it successfully found trace amounts of cocaine in blood. This research was expanded upon and led to the creation of a product called MEDIC (microfluidic electrochemical detector for in vivo continuous monitoring) developed by faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara. MEDIC is an instrument that can continuously determine the concentrations of different molecules in the blood. The blood doesn't have to be mixed with anything prior to testing to create a ‘serum’ as the first device did. MEDIC can detect a wide variety of drug molecules and biomarkers. In trials, early models of the device failed after about half an hour because the proteins in whole blood clung to the sensors and clogged the components. This problem was solved via a second chamber that allowed a liquid buffer to flow over the sensors with the blood, without mixing or disturbing the blood, so the results remained unchanged. The device is still in clinical trials and actual implementation in medicine is likely years away, however in the interim, its creators estimate that it could also be used in the pharmaceutical industry to allow for better testing in Phase 3 clinical trials.  Vaccines  Vaccinations (see Vaccine) are typically dosed in milliliters because most are administered as liquids. Each individual vaccine comes with constraints regarding at what age they should be administered, how many doses must be given, and over what period of time. There are 15 vaccines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend every person (in the United States and Canada) receive between birth and 18 years of age to protect against various infectious agents that may affect long-term health. Most vaccines require multiple doses for full immunity, given in recommended intervals depending on the vaccine. There are several typical vaccination routes: * Intramuscular injection: the needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin into the muscle, beneath the skin and (subcutaneous) tissues that rest on top. * Subcutaneous injection: the needle is inserted at a 45 degree angle into the (subcutaneous) tissue between the outer layer of the skin and the muscle. * Nasal: the vaccine is sprayed into the nose and absorbed through the nasal passage. * Oral: the vaccine is swallowed and ingested.  Nutrition  For healthy humans, experts recommend daily intake quantities of certain vitamins and minerals. The Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, and National Academy of Sciences sets a recommended Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) in several forms: # Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily intake which adequately meets the nutrient requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals. # Adequate Intake (AI): established when the evidence gathered for an RDA is inconclusive, An AI is assumed to recommend a daily amount to meet nutritional adequacy. # Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): maximum amount of a nutrient which can be consumed without causing adverse impacts to an individual's health. DRIs are established for elements, vitamins, and macronutrients. Common elemental and vitamin dosages are milligrams per day (mg/d) or micrograms per day (μg/d). Common macronutrient dosages are in grams per day (g/d). Dosages for all three are established by both gender and age. Individuals take vitamin and mineral supplements to promote healthier lifestyles and prevent development of chronic diseases. There is no conclusive evidence linking continued vitamin and mineral supplement intake with longevity of life. Infectious dose The infectious dose of a pathogen is the number of cells required to infect the host. All pathogens have an infectious dose typically given in number of cells. The infectious dose varies by organism and can be dependent on the specific type of strain. Some pathogens can infect a host with only a few cells, while others require millions or billions. Examples of infectious doses, ranked loosely in increasing order:https://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/Atlanta2010/Slides_FSEC_JGreig_Doses.pdf?redirecthttp=true * Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (causes hemorrhaging of the intestines): 10 bacteria cells * Hepatitis A: 10-100 virus particles * Norovirus (commonly called ‘a stomach bug’): 10-100 virus particles * Rotavirus (severe diarrhea, can be fatal): 10-100 virus particles * Shigella (shigellosis): 500 bacteria cells * Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A strep throat): 1000 bacteria cells * Salmonella: varies by strain, 100-1 billion bacteria cells * Vibrio cholerae (Cholera): 1000-100,000,000 bacteria cells Typically, stomach acids can kill bacteria below the infectious dosing range for a given pathogen and keep the host from feeling symptoms or falling ill. Complexes constructed by fat can protect infectious agents from stomach acid, making fatty foods more likely to contain pathogens that successfully infect the host. For individuals with low or reduced stomach acid concentrations, in infectious dosage for a pathogen will be lower than normal. Rather than being administered by a physician or individual, infectious dosages are transmitted to a person from other persons or the environment, are generally accidental, and result in adverse side effects until the pathogen is defeated by the individual's immune system or flushed out of the individual's system by excretory processes.

Therefore, DNA inserted into a shuttle vector can be tested or manipulated in two different cell types. The main advantage of these vectors is they can be manipulated in E. coli, then used in a system which is more difficult or slower to use (e.g. yeast). Shuttle vectors include plasmids that can propagate in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (e.g. both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli) or in different species of bacteria (e.g. both E. coli and Rhodococcus erythropolis). There are also adenovirus shuttle vectors, which can propagate in E. coli and mammals. Shuttle vectors are frequently used to quickly make multiple copies of the gene in E. coli (amplification). They can also be used for in vitro experiments and modifications (e.g. mutagenesis, PCR). One of the most common types of shuttle vectors is the yeast shuttle vector. Almost all commonly used S. cerevisiae vectors are shuttle vectors. Yeast shuttle vectors have components that allow for replication and selection in both E. coli cells and yeast cells. The E. coli component of a yeast shuttle vector includes an origin of replication and a selectable marker, e.g. antibiotic resistance, beta lactamase, beta galactosidase. The yeast component of a yeast shuttle vector includes an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a yeast centromere (CEN), and a yeast selectable marker (e.g. URA3, a gene that encodes an enzyme for uracil synthesis, Lodish et al. 2007).

Description  Microhyla achatina is a small species with a narrow head. its eyes are small and the feet have partially webbed digits. Males have a snout-to-vent length around and females are a little larger. It is yellowish brown on the dorsal side with two dark stripes, with a symmetric arrow-shaped mark and sometimes a narrow pale line along the spine. The sides are dark.  Habitat and distribution  This is a frog of primary and secondary forest, sometimes found around human developments, such as paddy fields and forest gardens. This species is found at altitudes up to above sea level. This frog is endemic to Java and is found in the central and western parts of the island. Biology The diet of this frog consists of ants, termites and many other tiny insects. It breeds in ponds, permanent pools or marshy areas and the males call at night, several neighboring frogs making a chorus and producing a song that sounds like the sounds made by crickets. The call has a frequency of between 3 and 3.2 kHz, with a pulse rate of 14–20 pulses per second, and a duration of less than a second. Females lay small clutches of about 20 eggs. Status This frog has a relatively wide range and the population seems to be stable so the IUCN rates it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline, if any, is insufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. It is to some extent tolerant of forest degradation and no particular threats to this species have been identified.

The lodge was built in 1929 by Emil Wanatka on land he acquired that same year. Little Bohemia gained fame and infamy as the setting of a botched raid by the FBI (then called the Division of Investigation) against the John Dillinger Gang. The historic rustic lodge remains as it was at the time of the federal raid and along with original bullet holes from the gun battle still in the walls and windows, Little Bohemia Lodge has a collection of memorabilia from the gun battle.Little Bohemia Lodge/John Dillinger The Gun Battle On the afternoon of April 20, 1934, Baby Face Nelson, John Dillinger, Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll, John Hamilton, and gang associate (errand-runner) Pat Reilly, accompanied by Nelson's wife Helen and three girlfriends of the other men, arrived at the secluded Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin, for a weekend of rest. The gang's connection to the resort apparently came from the past dealings between Dillinger's attorney, Louis Piquett, and lodge owner Emil Wanatka. Though gang members greeted him by name, Wanatka maintained that he was unaware of their identities until some time on Friday night. According to Bryan Burrough's book Public Enemies: America's Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933–34, this most likely happened when Wanatka was playing cards with Dillinger, Nelson, and Hamilton. When Dillinger won a round and raked in the pot, Wanatka caught a glimpse of Dillinger's pistol concealed in his coat, and noticed that Nelson and the others also had shoulder holsters. The following day, while she was away from the lodge with her young son at a children's birthday party, Wanatka's wife informed a friend, Henry Voss, that the Dillinger gang was at the lodge, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was subsequently given the tip early on April 22. FBI agent Melvin Purvis and a number of his fellow colleagues arrived by plane from Chicago. Because the gang's departure was imminent, the agents moved in with little preparation, and without notifying or obtaining help from local authorities. Wanatka offered a one-dollar dinner special on Sunday nights, and the last of a crowd estimated at 75 people were leaving as the agents arrived in the front driveway. A 1933 Chevrolet coupé was leaving at that moment with three departing lodge customers, John Hoffman, Eugene Boisneau and John Morris. The agents shouted at the men to stop, but the shouting was apparently not heard over the car radio and the men began to drive away. The agents quickly opened fire on them, instantly killing Boisneau and wounding the others, and alerting the gang members inside. Adding to the chaos, Pat Reilly returned to the lodge after an out-of-town errand for Van Meter at the same time, accompanied by one of the gang's girlfriends, Pat Cherrington. Accosted by the agents, Reilly and Cherrington backed out and escaped under fire, after a number of misfortunes. Dillinger, Van Meter, Hamilton, and Carroll immediately escaped through the back of the lodge, which was unguarded, and made their way north on foot through woods and past a lake to commandeer a car and a driver at a resort a mile away. Carroll was not far behind them. He made it to Manitowish and stole a car, making it uneventfully to St. Paul. Nelson was outside the lodge in the adjacent cabin, and he characteristically attacked the raiding party head on. He exchanged fire with Purvis before retreating into the lodge under a return volley from other agents. He slipped out the back and fled in the opposite direction from the others. Emerging from the woods ninety minutes later, a mile away from Little Bohemia, Nelson kidnapped the Lange couple from their home and ordered them to drive him away. Apparently dissatisfied with the car's speed, he ordered them to pull up at a brightly-lit house. It was the home of switchboard operator Alvin Koerner. Already aware of the ongoing events, Koerner phoned authorities at one of the involved lodges to report a suspicious vehicle in front of his home. Shortly after this, Nelson entered the home, taking the Koerners hostage. Emil Wanatka arrived with his brother-in-law George LaPorte and a lodge employee. A fourth man remained in the car. The three new arrivals were also taken prisoner. Nelson ordered Koerner and Wanatka back into the vehicle, where the fourth man remained unnoticed in the back seat. As they were preparing to leave, with Wanatka driving at gunpoint, another car arrived with federal agents W. Carter Baum and Jay Newman, and a local constable, Carl Christensen. Nelson asked the men who they were and upon the agents identifying themselves, Nelson opened fire with a custom-converted machine gun pistol, severely wounding Christensen (who was seriously wounded 9 times in the chest, arms and legs) and Newman (who was seriously wounded by a single gunshot wound in the head) and killing Baum, who was shot three times in the neck. Nelson was later quoted as having said that Baum had him \\"cold\\" and couldn't understand why he hadn't fired. It was later discovered that the safety catch on Baum's gun was on. Nelson then stole the FBI car. Less than 15 miles away, the car suffered a flat tire and became mired in mud as Nelson attempted unsuccessfully to change it. Back on foot, he wandered into the woods and took up residence with a Chippewa family in their secluded cabin for several days before making his final escape in another commandeered vehicle. Three of the women who had accompanied the gang, including Nelson's wife Helen Gillis, were captured inside the lodge. After grueling interrogation by the FBI, the three were ultimately convicted on harboring charges and released on parole. With a federal agent and a civilian dead, and four more severely wounded, including two more civilians, and the complete escape of the Dillinger gang, the FBI came under severe criticism, with calls for FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's resignation and a widely circulated petition demanding Purvis's suspension. Public Enemies In the summer of 2008, some scenes from the Michael Mann film Public Enemies were filmed on location at Little Bohemia. The events of the shootout were drastically altered for artistic purposes, such as showing Nelson and Van Meter being gunned down by Purvis in a grassy field near Little Bohemia, when in reality, Van Meter was killed in August 1934 in St. Paul, and Nelson was killed in November 1934 in a shootout that also led to the deaths of agents Samuel P. Cowley and Herman Hollis. Today Little Bohemia remains operational today as a restaurant and gathering place. A historic display of artifacts and memorabilia from the Dillinger gun battle is available for public viewing along with recent memorabilia and autographs from the filming of Public Enemies.

Her early work, The Civilized Demons, reinterprets the heavenly battle between the Asuras and the Devas described in the Rigveda as a historical record of an earthly war in the Indus Valley between the Asuras (identified by her as being the Assyrian people) already living in the valley as the Harappan Civilization, and the invading Devas (identified by her with the Aryans). Her 1997 book The Language of the Harappans extends this theory by claiming that the unknown Harappan language was the Akkadian language of Mesopotamia, and that Sanskrit is a descendant of Akkadian.

Background From 1978 to 1983, the marathon was run at Otis Air Force Base and Camp Edwards in neighboring Bourne, Massachusetts. From 1984 the marathon has been held in Falmouth under the auspices of the Falmouth Track Club. The course of the Cape Cod Marathon is a certified Boston Marathon qualifying event and is sanctioned by USA Track and Field (USATF) New England division. Runner's World Magazine has named the Cape Cod Marathon one of the ten most scenic marathons in North America. Course The course includes both flat portions, including all of the first ten miles and final three miles, and rolling mounds at points between the 11th and 23rd miles. The maximum course elevation is about . The marathon passes through several of Falmouth's historic villages and residential hamlets. The course begins at the village green in Falmouth proper. It proceeds east along Nantucket Sound, an extension of the Atlantic Ocean, along the high bluffs of the Victorian resort of Falmouth Heights, across the rivers cutting through the beaches of Menauhant to the wooded lanes of the community of Davisville. There it turns north and moves by estuarine overlooks on Waquoit Bay towards the village green of Waquoit. Rolling inland, runners pass cranberry bogs on the path to the village of East Falmouth and through pine forest before reaching Hatchville. Straight west to the shore of Buzzards Bay, the course turns south of the modern resort of North Falmouth in favor of the serrated rises rounding the inlets of West Falmouth village. Proceeding south, runners pass through secluded Beebe Woods and by kettle holes that separate the exclusive settlements of Chappaquoit, Wood Neck, Sippewissett, and Quissett on rocky waterfront outcroppings abutted by salt marshes. The course rounds the southern tip of the town as it winds through the bustling streets in the port village of Woods Hole, otherwise renowned for its world-class scientific community. In Woods Hole, the route joins that of the Falmouth Road Race for a time, including the hallmark passing of Nobska Light, a celebrated lighthouse dating to 1829, in the 22nd mile. Silvery oyster ponds line the course along Vineyard Sound before runners reach the flat boulevards leading back through to Falmouth's village green and the finish line. Bands and an Elvis Presley- themed water stop in the 23rd mile line the course. The men's course record is held by Randy Thomas of Medway, Massachusetts: two hours, 17 minutes, 35 seconds (2:17:35) in 1986. Thomas was a multiple world and American record holder in distance running events. The women's course record is held by Cathy Schiro, now Cathy Schiro-O'Brien, of Dover, New Hampshire: two hours, 37 minutes, six seconds (2:37:06) in 1987. Schiro-O'Brien was a marathon runner in the 1992 Summer Olympics. Sponsorship The Cape Cod Marathon benefits from many sponsors, most of which are local businesses from Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the greater area. Dunkin' Donuts, based in Canton, Massachusetts, has been the titular sponsor in recent runnings.

The name is derived from the word jovem, which means \\"young\\", and Pan-american. The latter comes from the name of one of the earliest radio stations in Brazil, Rádio Panamericana, which began broadcasting from São Paulo on May 3, 1944 and was purchased in November of the same year by entrepreneur and sports executive Paulo Machado de Carvalho. History The idea to start an FM station began with Antonio Augusto Amaral de Carvalho Filho, (better known by his nickname, \\"Tutinha\\"), and began transmitting on July 1, 1976. The name \\"Jovem Pan\\", however, was coined in 1965 by Tutinha's father, Paulo. Tutinha's ideas were new to Brazilian FM radio. These ideas included new approaches to the DJ's delivery and the scope of music programming. They quickly put Jovem Pan near the top of the ratings. In July 1994, Jovem Pan started syndicating via satellite. The service (known as Jovem Pan Sat) was an immediate success and currently has over 75 affiliated stations.  Programs on Jovem Pan FM Sat  * Pânico: Since 1993, it is currently the most famous Brazilian radio program that is displayed every day at 12:00, the success of the program is so great that in 2003 it won its TV version continuing until 2012, soon after signing with another broadcaster of radio until 2017. Currently, the program is transmitted only by radio and internet through YouTube, by the application of the radio station or also by the site of Jovem Pan, in the hourly time of 12h.

The station was originally built in 1984, after the razing of the large depot just south of the current site. It is located north of the large BNSF Classification yard. Just south the Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg diverge via the Quincy main line which bypasses the yard on the east side. The California Zephyr and the Southwest Chief continue to the southwest side of Galesburg near Knox College. There are three tracks with one island platform and one side platform. Trains to California normally arrive on the track closest to the depot, known as track one. Trains between Quincy and Chicago arrive on track two and platform on the island platform as trains divert from the main line just south of the station and eventually on to the Brookfield Subdivision. In the early 2010s, the island platform received a yellow tactile warning strip that complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The project was funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 at an estimated cost of $75,000. The side platform already had a tactile warning strip.

A GE Evolution Series locomotive is also put on a side track for visitors to look at. The Galesburg Railroad Museum is next to the property. History The Nebraska Zephyr stopping at the depot in 1968 The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad was established in 1849 to rival the Galena & Chicago Union Railroad. Five years later, in 1854, the CB&Q; reached Galesburg a depot was constructed in the \\"Five Points\\" area, near Knox College. The wooden building had two stories, with offices on the second floor, and was connected to a hotel. In 1858, Stephen Douglass traveled through this station on his way to debate future president Abraham Lincoln. On March 1, 1881, the depot fell victim to a fire. 1884 saw the construction of a new CB&Q; depot on Seminary St. in Galesburg. The station, unlike the station at Five Points, was made of red brick. The structure was two stories tall, and included a clock tower in the center, with a steam locomotive weather-vane. It also had several platforms and tracks. Soon after the completion of the new depot, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway arrived in Galesburg and a Santa Fe depot was built just blocks away from the CB&Q; depot, a depot, which, by the mid-20th century, would see such notable trains as the Super Chief and El Capitan. Ironically, despite being built of brick, unlike its predecessor, it wound up falling victim to a similar fate almost exactly 30 years later. On May 27, 1911, a fire began in the attic of the building and the structure burned to the ground. Work began on a third structure soon after, and the building opened the following year. The third depot was 16,000 square feet, of reddish-brown brick and white limestone trim. Extra buildings would be added for freight and restaurants at each end of the main station house. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the CB&Q; introduced their famous Zephyr trains this depot became a station on several of the trains, including the Nebraska Zephyr, Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr and Denver Zephyr. It was also a station on the Exposition Flyer, operated jointly between the CB&Q;, Denver & Rio Grande Western and Western Pacific railroads between Chicago and Oakland, a train which would later be replaced by the famed California Zephyr. The depot eventually would serve Burlington Northern trains between 1970 and 1971 and later Amtrak trains post 1971. By the early 1980s, however, Burlington Northern officials began to question the necessity and practicality of having such a large depot in the face of declining passenger service. Following a study that stated that it would cost $1.5 million to renovate the building, the building was demolished overnight on May 13, 1983. In 1984, a one-story Amtrak station was built with funds donated partially by the passenger railroad and the Illinois Department of Transportation.

The game is an introductory level product with an emphasis on playability over simulation value. Simulations Publications, Inc. (SPI) issued Chinese Farm in 1975 as one of four games included in the Modern Battles Quad and individually in a folio format as part of its Modern Battles Series.  Game play  The Israeli player seeks to establish a bridgehead across the Suez Canal while the Egyptian player attempts to block this. Games are usually concluded in 1-2 hours. Chinese Farm contains three scenarios. Scenario one focuses on the Israeli approach to and initial crossing of the Suez Canal. Scenario two broadens the first scenario to include Israeli efforts to secure the west bank of the Suez Canal, and adds IAF air strikes and Egyptian SAM defences. Scenario three reorients the Egyptian positions to allow a better defense, and is ahistoric in this regard. Each scenario is subject to the standard rules developed for Modern Battle Folio Series games but also contains scenario-specific rules and victory conditions. Play is divided into eight 12-hour turns (scenarios two and three both have 12 turns) governed by the standard move-shoot sequence, zones of control, a terrain effects chart, and two differential combat results tables (CRT). Each player at the start of a new combat phase opts for either the Active or the Mobile CRT, reflecting differing levels of aggressiveness and risk of unit elimination. Air power is abstract and naval power is not simulated. The Egyptian player fields foot and mechanized infantry battalions, armored brigades, artillery, and mobile and static surface-to-air units and the Israeli player is provided armored and mechanized infantry battalions, limited artillery, and an engineer unit to bridge the Suez Canal. Units begin the game at set locations and both sides later receive reinforcements. Victory is achieved by receiving the most points based on a combination of territorial objectives, enemy units destroyed, and unit ending locations.  Components  100 die-cut counters representing Egyptian and Israeli units; a 17\\" by 22\\" hexagon-patterned paper map, two sets of random number chits, one standard rulebook for Modern Battle Folio Series games, and one exclusive rulebook for Chinese Farm.

With skilled military action, he came to control more than half of the island of Sardinia. By his control of the vast central plains and the rich deposits of precious metals, he increased the riches of his giudicato and staved off the general economic decline affecting the rest of Europe at the time. Biography He was the son and successor of Peter II of Arborea of the Bas-Serra family and a local woman named Sardinia. He succeeded to the throne at a young age under the regency of William of Capraia, a distant relative. William was the son of Bina de Lacon, widow of Peter I, and Hugh of Capraia, Count of Prato. William and his brothers Anselm and Berthold were pupils at the court of Peter II, who designated William regent for his son. On William's death in 1264, Marianus did not take the full reins of power, but instead had to recognize the co-dominion of William's son Nicholas. In 1270, he imprisoned Nicholas, and in 1274 had him killed and began to govern himself, though he was soon opposed by Berthold's son Anselm, who held Cagliari. Marianus was a close ally of the Republic of Pisa, the most powerful force on Sardinia in the mid-thirteenth century, and received Pisan citizenship on 17 June 1265. He often lived in Pisa and there he met his wife, a daughter of Andreotto Saraceno Caldera. In 1287, he married his son John with Giacomina, daughter of Ugolino della Gherardesca, of whom he was a partisan. Marianus was widowed by 1293. In 1274, he embarked on a series of belligerent adventures to extend his power into Cagliari and Logudoro. He conquered the castle of Monforte on the Nurra and restored it, leaving an epigraph now in the museum of Sassari. In 1277, his conquests were recognised by Pope John XXI. He had annexed part of Montiferru as far as Monte Acuto with all its castles. He thus divided the Logudorese giudicato into a south and north. He was appointed vicar general of Logudoro. In 1284, Marianus solicited the aid of Peter III of Aragon to retake Cagliari. In 1287, Anselm was defeated and killed. On 4 January 1295, he made a political about turn and left the third part of Cagliari to Pisa. A little later, he took part with his Gherardeschi in-laws in the siege of Villa di Chiesa, defended by the Guelphs of Donoratico. He was wounded and took refuge in San Leonardo di Siete Fuentes, where, according to some sources, he was poisoned in 1297 by the Pisans who wanted to extend their authority in Cagliari to the Argentiera of Cixerri. Asides from his son and successor, John, he left a daughter and an illegitimate son named Barisone (died 1305).

Gledden was born at Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, County Durham, England. As a youth Gledden spent many years in Germany, Finland and other continental countries, and became a good linguist. He moved to Australia around 1890 and was licensed as a surveyor in Queensland. He went to Perth, Western Australia, about the beginning of 1892, and after practising for a few months as a surveyor was asked by William Marmion, then the minister of lands, to take charge of mining surveys at Coolgardie. He made a preliminary survey there and about a year later laid out the site of Kalgoorlie. Gledden acted as mining registrar and warden at different times and was well acquainted with all the early pioneers at the goldfields. Having a good memory and a keen sense of humour his reminiscences of life during the early days of the goldfields were found very interesting in later years. Gledden retired in 1900 and spent much time travelling with his wife before settling at Caulfield near Melbourne. After his wife died about 1921, Gleddon continued to travel, but kept his interest in Western Australia and spent a good deal of his time there. Gledden died at Perth on 5 November 1927, there were no children. He was a good business man and made money largely out of investing in land in Western Australia. His will provided that the whole of his estate, subject to three annuities, should go to the University of Western Australia to provide scholarships in applied science, beginning 10 years after his death. The amount made available to the university was about £55,000, and the income is used mainly to provide the Robert Gledden and Maud Gledden travelling fellowships of £750 a year. In addition there are Gledden studentships to enable engineers or surveyors to travel to other parts of Australia, and Gledden scholarships to assist students in engineering, surveying or the applied sciences generally. The Gledden Building in Perth was named in his honour.

The company is now owned by Metcash and operates as IGA. The chain was originally owned and operated by the Fleming family, and was not related to the \\"Jewel\\" supermarket chain in the United States. History  The Fleming family sold their Sydney-based Flemings supermarkets chain to Woolworths Limited in June 1960. They continued operating that chain through Woolworths for the next 10 years before acquiring the 42-store Warmans grocery chain and relaunching it as a discount supermarket under the \\"Jewel Food Stores\\" name. Its generic product range was called \\"No Name\\". Jewel was pitched as a low-price supermarket chain similar to Flemings. It was credited with bringing the food barn concept to Australia through the Jewel Food Barn format, which sold dry groceries and frozen foods only. The stores had a downmarket look similar to its major rival Franklins, another discount supermarket chain based and established in Sydney. To a lesser extent, it also competed with the Newcastle-based Shoeys discount supermarkets, later to be taken over by BI-LO from South Australia. While Jewel found limited success in New South Wales against long-time incumbent Franklins, Jewel entered Victoria a few years before Franklins and found more success there. In the early 1990s, Jewel launched Jewel Country Fresh in response to Franklins and BI-LO launching market-style full-line discount supermarkets. Jewel also acquired the Rainbow supermarket in Doonside, Western Sydney. These formats carried not only dry groceries and frozen foods, but also fresh foods in a market-style environment. In 1995, Jewel Food Stores Pty Ltd was acquired by Davids Holdings (which later became Metcash Trading Ltd. In 1998 Davids sold its chain of 130 Jewel supermarkets to Independent Retailers for about $100 million. A number of stores closed. The Jewel name disappeared completely when Independent Retailers rationalised their 29 different grocery banners to form one, Independent Grocers of Australia (IGA). This said, a Jewel branded IGA supermarket existed in Sunshine, Victoria until about 2000, and one in Lalor Park NSW retained its branding until 2011 according to Google street view. Advertising As it was a discount supermarket, Jewel usually only advertised specials in-store, rather than advertise the specials everywhere. However, in 1995, Jewel did have an advertising campaign, emphasising on its low-price positioning. This was in the same year that the Fleming family sold the 130 Jewel supermarkets to what is now Metcash (then Davids).

Formed in 1979 by guitarist Radovan Jovićević, keyboardist Zoran Živanović and vocalist Zana Nimani, Zana's first releases saw large mainstream popularity. Until the mid-1980s the band had moved from their initial new wave and synthpop sound towards pop rock. After the departure of Zana Nimani in 1984, Jovićević and Živanović continued to lead the band, changing vocalists. During the 1990s, Zana worked as a trio consisting of Jovićević, Živanović and vocalist Jelena Galonić, moving towards pop and away from Serbian rock scene. In 1999, Jovićević left the group, leaving Živanović and Galonić as the only official members of Zana. In the 2010s, Živanović and Galonić formed a new lineup, making a return to pop rock format. History=The beginnings (1976-1979) The guitarist Radovan Jovićević and the keyboardist Jovan Živanović \\"Kikamac\\" started to work together in 1976, playing in several high school bands. On a dance in Saint Sava elementary school in Belgrade, on which their band Suton (Dusk) performed, Jovićević brought his girlfriend at the time Zana Nimani. She sang, having her first performance with Jovićević and Živanović. They soon got a term to record in Radio Belgrade's Studio VI, where they were spotted by lyricist Marina Tucaković, who had previously worked with Srđan Marjanović, DAG, YU Grupa, Bisera Veletanlić, Ambasadori, Dado Topić, Slađana Milošević and other acts.Marina Tucaković writing credits at Discogs She got interested in the band, and soon became not only their lyricist, but also their official member. In 1979, Jovićević, Živanović and Nimani started to perform under the name Zana. The first lineup of Zana also featured the guitarist Igor Jovanović, the bass guitarist Bogdan Dragović and the drummer Aleksandar Ivanov. Zana Nimani years (1979-1984) In 1980, Zana recorded their first 7\\" single with the songs \\"Nastavnice\\" (\\"Hey, Teacher\\") and \\"Sveta\\". They were declined by PGP-RTB, but soon after signed by Jugoton, which released the single, on which a children choir made a guest appearance. The band started performing live, with alternative music saxophonist Paul Pignon occasionally performing with them. They had their first public performance in Belgrade in November 1980, performing as an opening act on Generacija 5 concert in Pionir Hall. In 1981, Jugoton refused to give Zana unlimited period to record their debut album, so the band moved to PGP-RTB, for which they released the single \\"Leto\\" (\\"Summer\\"), intentionally releasing it in May. As \\"Leto\\" had success on the market, Jugoton agreed to Zana's terms, so the band signed back to Jugoton. The band's debut album, Loše vesti uz rege za pivsku flašu (Bad News Accompanied by Reggae for a Beer Bottle) was released in 1981. It was recorded in Jugoton's Studio VI, and produced by the band members themselves. On the album, Živanović was signed as \\"Kikamac\\" only, because prior to the album release his fees were by mistake often paid to Zoran Živanović \\"Hoze\\" of the band Mama Co Co. The album brought hits \\"Jutro me podseća na to\\" (\\"Morning Reminds Me of It\\"), \\"On\\" (\\"He\\"), \\"Miševi beli celu noć\\" (\\"White Mice All Night\\") and \\"Loše vesti\\" (\\"Bad News\\"), the latter featuring altered lyrics, because Jugoton demanded the original politically provocative lyrics to be changed. The band promoted the album with a concert in Dadov Theatre. On a fund-raising concert in Sarajevo they performed as an opening act for Bijelo Dugme. The December 1981 mini-tour across Serbia was ended when Aleksandar Ivanov left the band due to his army obligations, but he was soon replaced by Pavle Nikolić. The band's second album, Dodirni mi kolena (Touch My Knees) was recorded in Sweden during May 1982, with the help of saxophonist Goran Nillson, percussionist Byl Gunnar Byllin, and multi instrumentalist, recorder and producer Tini Varga, who also coauthored lyrics for two songs on the album. During the album recording, Tucaković stopped being the band's official member, but continued to write lyrics for them. The album brought synthpop-oriented hits \\"Dodirni mi kolena\\", \\"Majstor za poljupce\\" (\\"Kisses Maestro\\"), \\"13 je moj srećan broj\\" (\\"13 Is My Lucky Number\\"), and the album saw high number sales. In September, the same month when the album was released, Jovanović left the band due to his army obligations, and was replaced by Aleksandar Radulović \\"Futa\\". At the end of 1982, the band went on a tour across Serbia, Macedonia, Herzegovina and Dalmatia, however, the concerts saw bad reviews, as the band failed to reach standards of the studio recordings. In May 1983, Jovanović and Ivanov returned to the band, and Dragović and Radulović left. After leaving Zana, Dragović and Radulović formed the band Zamba (which also featured the guitarist Nikola Čuturilo and the drummer Predrag \\"Bata\\" Jakovljević). The band's new bass guitarist became Miloš Stojisavljević \\"Cajger\\", a former member of Generacija 5. In August 1983, Zana recorded their new studio album, entitled Natrag na voz (Back to the Train), also recorded in Sweden and produced by Tini Varga. The album's biggest hits were the duet \\"Jabuke i vino\\" (\\"Apples and Wine\\"), sung by Nimani and Željko Bebek (although the band initially considered Daniel, Oliver Mandić, Jura Stublić, or Branimir \\"Džoni\\" Štulić for the song) and \\"Mladiću moj\\" (\\"My Boy\\"). At the time of album release, the end of 1983, Ivanov left the band, and was replaced by Predrag Jakovljević (formerly of Zamba). In February 1984, Zana went on a promotional tour, but as the audience showed little interest in their concerts, they ended the tour in March. Soon after, Jovičić and Kikamac went to serve the army, the band went on hiatus, and Nimani decided to start a solo career. After the release of her only solo album Noćas pevam samo tebi (Tonight I Sing only for You) in 1986, she retired from music. Nataša Gajović and Nataša Živković years (1985-1990) In 1985, Jovićević and Živanović reunited Zana with the new vocalist, Nataša Gajović. With the album Zana, also known as Crvene lale (Red Tulips), released in 1985 and produced by Saša Habić, they moved towards pop sound. The album brought the hit \\"A što, a što\\" (\\"Why, Oh Why\\"). Their next album, Otkinimo noćas zajedno (Let's Get Crazy Tonight Together), released in 1987 and produced by Dušan Petrović \\"Šane\\", brought folk-inspired hit \\"Vejte snegovi\\" (\\"Fall Heavily, Snows\\"), which featured Boki Milošević on clarinet. The 1988 album Zana, produced by Tini Varga, featured Mladen Vojičić Tifa and Laza Ristovski as guest musicians. The album brought hits \\"Oženićeš se ti, udaću se ja\\" (\\"You Will Get Married, I Will Get Married\\"), \\"Vojna pošta\\" (\\"Military Post\\") and \\"Vlak\\" (\\"Train\\"). In 1989, Gajović left the band, retiring from music and moving to Saudi Arabia. Most of the members also left the band, so Jovićević and Živanović recorded the album Zana, also known as Rukuju se, rukuju (They're Saying Goodbye, They're Saying Goodbye) after its biggest hit with the new vocalist, Nataša Živković, and studio musicians. . The album was produced by Jovićević, Živanović and Laza Ristovski and released in 1989. The track \\"E, moj doktore\\" (\\"Oh, Doctor\\") featured folk singer Dragana Mirković on vocals, and the song \\"Napravite mostove\\" (\\"Build Bridges\\") featured the girl group Šarmerke on vocals. After only two years spent with Zana, Živković joined Hare Krishna and withdrawn from the scene. In 1990, to celebrate ten years of activity, Jovićević and Živanović released the compilation album Najlepše pesme 1980-1990 (Most Beautiful Songs 1980 - 1990). Jelena Galonić years (1991-1999) With Zana's fourth singer, Jelena Galonić, Jovićević and Živanović recorded the albums Zana, released in 1991, featuring the hit \\"Nisam, nisam (Devojka tvoga druga)\\" (\\"I'm Not, I'm Not (Your Friend's Girlfriend)\\"), and Tražim (I'm Searching), released in 1993, featuring the hit \\"Priča se, priča (Da Rusi dolaze)\\" (\\"They're Saying, They're Saying (That the Russians are Coming)\\"). At the beginning of 1996, the compilation album Zlatni hitovi 1980 - 1995 (Golden Hits 1980 - 1995) was released, featuring two new songs, \\"Modrice\\" (\\"Bruises\\") and \\"Gušti, gušti\\" (a cover of the song by Istrian singer Alan Vitasović), the videos for which were recorded at Thailand. The album Zanomanija (Zanomania), released in 1997, featured a remixed version of \\"Modirce\\" and a cover of Time song \\"Da li znaš da te volim\\" (\\"Did You Know that I Love You\\"). In the autumn of 1998, they released the live album Zana uživo (Zana Live), recorded on their concert held in Sava Centar on 1 November 1997. The album featured singer Brankica Vasić as guest. In 1999, they released the album Prijatelji (Friends), which featured sound resembling their early works. On the song \\"40\\", which deals with the life of a middle aged man, Živanović sang for the first time. Beside Zana members, the authors of the lyrics were Marina Tucaković and Bora Đorđević. Zana as a duo (1999-2015) In 1999, Jovićević moved to the United States, leaving Živanović and Galonić as Zana's only official members. In 2001, the two released album 21, featuring songs composed by Živanović on the lyrics by Galonić and Marina Tucaković. The album was produced by Žika Filipović and Živanović and Galonić themselves. In 2006, the two released the album Kao nekad (Just like Before), which featured remixes of \\"Vejte snegovi\\" and \\"Dodirni mi kolena\\". In June 2008, Živanović and Galonić got married. On 29 April 2010, Zana celebrated thirty years of work with a concert in Sava Centar. Nataša Gajović and Nataša Živković made guest appearances on the concert. Return to rock format (2015 - present) In 2015, after a five- year hiatus in their work, the band, in the lineup consisting of Galonić, Živanović, Milica Rančić (drums), Dejan Trajković (guitar), Miljan Davidović (klavijature), Zoran Jakšić (bass guitar), released the single \\"Maco\\" (\\"Honey\\").\\"POSLE 15 GODINA Grupa \\"Zana\\" vraća se na muzičku scenu\\", blic.rs; accessed 8 January 2017.

It is only meant for those people who are already in mainstay civilian professions; in fact, gainful employment or self-employment in a civil profession is a prerequisite for joining the Territorial Army. Volunteers of the Territorial Army usually serve in uniform for 2-3 months every year, so that they can bear arms for national defence in times of dire need or national emergencies. History The Indian Defence Force (IDF), incorporating Europeans and Indians in separate sections, was formed by the British on 9 October 1917. It was established in order to release regular troops from garrison duties during the First World War. It was divided into British and Indian sections. Like the Indian Army of the time, units in the Indian section consisted primarily of British officers and Indian other ranks. Units in the British section were all British. The Indians were volunteers, but many of the Europeans were conscripted, as the Indian Defence Force Act 1917 made military service compulsory for all Europeans permanently residing in British India (including the princely states) between the ages of 16 and 50.\\"Indian Defence Force\\", The Times, 3 March 1917 Boys between 16 and 18 were only obliged to undertake training and men over 40 only had to serve in their local district, but men between 19 and 40 were obliged to serve anywhere required within the country. Only the clergy were exempt.\\"Compulsory Service in India: The New Defence Force\\", The Times, 7 March 1917 The IDF was generally unpopular among the British conscripts. It was replaced by the Auxiliary Force (for Europeans and Eurasians) and the Indian Territorial Force (for Indians) in 1920.\\"Indian Auxiliary Force: First Year's Success\\", The Times, 12 October 1921 The modern Territorial Army was inaugurated by the first Indian Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari, on 9 October 1949 after the Independence Territorial Army Act was passed in 1948. The annual Prime Minister's Territorial Army Day Parade takes place on 9 October. The Territorial Army initially had various types of units such as armoured regiments, infantry battalions, air defence, medical regiments, engineers field park companies, signal regiments, Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) workshops, coast batteries, Army Service Corps GT Coy, ASC Compo Pl, and AMC field ambulances. By 1972, these units were either disbanded or converted to Regular Army units with the exception of infantry battalions. Territorial Army units were actively involved in military operations in 1962, 1965 and 1971. The \\"Terriers\\" have also taken part in Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka, Operation Rakshak in Punjab & J&K;, Operation Rhino and Operation Bajrang in the North East. Departmental units came to the aid of the civil authorities during industrial unrest and natural calamities, most famous being earthquake in Latur (Maharashtra), Uttarkashi in Garhwal Himalaya and the super cyclone in Odisha. The Ecological units have arrested man-made environmental degradation by planting 2.5 crore trees over 20,000 hectare of land in Mussoorie hills and Pithoragarh (Uttarakhand), Bikaner and Jaisalmer (Rajasthan) and ravines of Chambal in Madhya Pradesh. Force structure The Territorial Army is a part of the regular Indian Army. The present role of the Territorial Army is to relieve the Regular Army from static duties and assist civil administration in dealing with natural calamities and maintenance of essential services in situations where life of the communities is affected or the security of the country is threatened, and to provide units for the Regular Army as and when required. The Territorial Army has a strength of approximately 40,000 first- line troops (and 160,000 second line troops) comprising departmental Territorial Army units such as railway, IOC, ONGC, telecommunication and General Hospital, and the non-departmental Territorial Army units of infantry battalions and ecological battalions affiliated to various infantry regiments.

Returning to America at the age of 17, she pursued a bachelor's degree in Communications from the University of Iowa, where she was a member of the undergraduate Iowa Writers Workshop.  Career  After graduation, Caldwell moved to Chicago, Illinois to work as a producer/writer. Whilst in Chicago, she became involved with an inner city tutoring program, resulting in the production of her first documentary, 'Cabrini Green... what you don't see' which aired on the Chicago PBS station. She eventually became an original founder and board director for the Tutor/Mentor Connection. Caldwell moved to Washington, DC in 1989 to work for WORLDNET, a division of USIA. Here, she was a writer/producer for live interactive broadcasts to Africa, East Asia, and the Middle East. She then worked at Motion Masters in Charleston, WV for six months before returning to Chicago in 1991 to form Amphion Productions. She then worked as a freelance writer/producer on hundreds of projects and was a 1997 competition winner for the Chicago/Illinois Screenplay Contest. She moved her company to Los Angeles in 1998 and has since written three books on screenwriting/film production topics. She is also a professor of film/screenwriting courses at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California and the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandizing (FIDM) in Los Angeles. In 2010 she partnered with her husband Walter Gorey to form House of Gorey Productions. In 2018, she penned her first young adult novel, Raven Dock, to be published by White Bird Publications. The novel is part of a series known as Dark Coven. She also co- wrote/produced/directed the YouTube comedy web series, BOOMERS.  Personal life  Caldwell lives in Valencia, California.

Product line  Aplets & Cotlets are Liberty Orchards' oldest and best known products. These two types of confection are mainly sold together in a single box; they are produced from a recipe for locoum using local apples and apricots. Other flavors produced by the company include pineapple with macadamia nuts, strawberry with walnuts, orange with walnuts, peach with pecans, blueberry with pecans, and raspberry with pecans. They also produce sugar-free, nut-free and chocolate-covered varieties, as well as a number of traditional filled chocolates (truffle, caramel, and mint, for example). In 2009, the company has introduced a cherry-pecan locoum, as well as four varieties (mango, strawberry, watermelon and papaya) dusted with a sweet-sour-spicy coating. Although many of these confections are marketed under American-style brand-names, they are referred to on product packaging as \\"Rahat Locoum.\\" Since 2012, the company has also marketed a line of confections with special packaging under the name \\"Turkish Delights,\\" which includes traditional Middle Eastern flavors such as rose-pistachio, orange- blossom-walnut, mint, and rose-lemon.  Local community interaction Liberty Orchard products are widely distributed via national chain stores and on the internet. In September 1997 Liberty Orchards was criticized for threatening to move production out of Cashmere unless the town met certain demands that the company hoped would increase their brand profile. These were reported by The New York Times at the time: :\\"They want all road signs and official correspondence by the city to say 'Cashmere, Home of Aplets and Cotlets'. They have asked that one of the two main streets in town be changed to Cotlets Avenue, and the other one be renamed Aplets Avenue. The candy maker also wants the Mayor and Council to sell City Hall to them, build new parking lots and possibly go to the bond market to start a tourism campaign on behalf of the worldwide headquarters of a company that says its story is 'America in a nutshell'.\\"  Notes  External links  * Liberty Orchards Category:Companies based in Chelan County, Washington ","title":"Liberty Orchards"},{"id":"10450214","text":"One Show may refer to: *The One Club, an American non-profit organization *The One Show, a British television newsmagazine programme ","title":"One Show"},{"id":"10450242","text":"is a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Root, and published by Orbit, also known for the creation of the Yami to Bōshi to Hon no Tabibito visual novel. The game was released in Japan on May 25, 2007 in regular and deluxe editions. A PlayStation 2 version, called , was released on October 1, 2009, with adult content removed. A manga adaptation was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq. A 26-episode anime adaptation produced by Studio Deen aired between April and September 2007. The series is a spin-off of Moonlight Lady, and as such the original name of the game was . The title was later shortened to simply Tōka Gettan and the subtitle was removed. Plot Tōka Gettan is set in the land of Kamitsumihara, where traces of magic and legend can still be seen. The land has been under the protection of the Kamiazuma clan since it was founded. The story revolves around Tōka Kamiazuma, the main protagonist, and his encounter with a young girl named Momoka Kawakabe who comes to stay with the clan. Their meeting sets off a chain of events that would bring an ancient legend to life. Characters ; : (PC), Daisuke Kishio (PS2), Mariya Ise (anime) :Tōka is the protagonist of the series and the adopted child of Yumiko Kamiazuma. He has a sacred, soul-eating blade, called the Stone Sword within his chest. Some believe him to be the reincarnation of Isamihiko, the former wielder of the Stone Sword. In reality, he is a non-human replacement of Yumiko's lost daughter, (who was also named Tōka) and the Stone Sword is an integral part of his body, since he was specifically born to wield it. :Tōka has two different forms in the series. As Yumiko's \\"daughter\\", he has long hair and wears a red kimono, while normally he is short-haired and wears a casual black shirt and trousers, or a school uniform. Regardless of his outer appearance, his personality is always rather blunt, callous and short-spoken. The only people he seems to care about are his adoptive mother, Yumiko, and Momoka. Despite loving Momoka he plans to end the curse, no matter the sacrifices he must do. ; : (PC), Tae Okajima (PS2), Saori Hayami (anime) :Momoka is the female protagonist who embodies the goddess Sei. Her most outstanding quality is her infinite appetite as she often seen with food in her mouth; she is also comparable to a puppy with her very accurate ability to catch food in her mouth. She is very infatuated with Tōka and has a very bright personality compared to Tōka's gloomy attitude. Later it is hinted that she, as Sei, was the one who killed Isamihiko, the former wielder of the Sword Stone. It is revealed at the end that she is a character created in the story of Yumiko, and so, she only can exist as Momoka inside the Land of Kamitsumihara. Also, as a goddess she is needed to break the curse but that would make her disappear along with her sisters, the other goddesses. Still, she is willing to help Touka, and promises him that if they ever meet again she will definitely not hesitate in making their love come true. ; : (PC), Airi Yoshida (PS2), Miki Itou (anime) :Yumiko is Tōka's adoptive mother and the daughter of Kiyoharu and Yuriko. She is a novelist and her writings usually have a supernatural effect over the land. She has a very childish personality which causes problems for her maid, Nene. Her attitude is very erotic and she sometimes molests Tōka. She is the current host for the goddess Juna. Due to mental scars caused by her traumatic childhood, Yumiko is unable to live normally without the presence of Juna. In episode 19, it is disclosed that she has suffered from sexual abuse at the hands of Kiyotsugu, who- since he believes he is Kiyoharu (Yumiko's father)- also believes that Yumiko is her mother Yuriko, who Kiyoharu also molested. ; :Yuriko is Yumiko's mother. It is revealed that since childhood, she was sexually abused by her brother Kiyoharu, escalating to the point he raped and impregnated her. Despite this, however, Yuriko refused to abort and raised Yumiko on her own. ; : (PC), Hitomi (PS2), Ayumi Fujimura (anime) :Nene is Yumiko's maid who has magical powers. Her lifespan is different from ordinary humans, and has enabled her to live for thousands of years. She is a wise person, excellent cook and has knowledge of various medicines. Her mother is an immortal witch, Yukihime, and she has three sisters, Kaya, Anna, and Sarara (who was an incarnation of Eve). ; : (PC), Kaori Mizuhashi (PS2), Eri Kitamura (anime) :Makoto is a young girl who attends Tōka's Academy, and has the spirit of the Great Dragon inside of her. She seems to have an attraction to Momoka, similar to Shoko's attraction to her. When playing her flute, she can wield the Dragon's power, which resonates with the Stone sword within Tōka. She tends to add Italian words or phrases to her speech, often music-related. ; : (PC), Yuuhi Mayama (PS2), Yu Kobayashi (anime) :Shōko is the chairperson of the Lotus Association. She often has disputes with the Butterfly Triplets. She drives an indestructible, flying car, often in places where cars should not go (i.e. school hallways). Her personality turns rough when she loses her glasses. She has an obsessive attraction to Makoto, as she often fantasizes about her and the latter in romantic and even perverted scenarios. ; : (PC), Haruka Shimazaki (PS2), Yu Kobayashi (anime) :Kikyō is the head of the Student Council. She is the immortal guardian of the land of Kamiazuma who has been fending off powers of Darkness since the early ages. ; : (PC), Takahiro Mizushima (PS2), Kenji Nomura (anime) :Haruhiko is the son of Kiyotsugu Kamiazuma. He is a major playboy, although his confidence with his own attractiveness is usually shown to be rather exaggerated, making him serve mainly as a comedic relief. He has a scar on his back that was caused by the Stone Sword when he was a child. ; : (PC), Ken Narita (PS2), Shou Hayami (anime) :Kiyotsugu is the father of Haruhiko, and the uncle of Yumiko. Due to an incident in the past, his brother Kiyoharu, who had gone insane, implanted a shard of a magical mask into Kiyotsugu's eye. The shard, containing Kiyoharu's memories, caused Kiyotsugu to believe that he was his brother. As Kiyoharu, he has mistaken Yumiko for his sister Yuriko, and has put her through the same sexual abuse that Kiyoharu had put Yuriko through. ; :They are the demonic sisters that head the society in opposition to the Lotus Association. Their followers are mainly seen with black veils over their faces. They can transform into butterflies (hence their name) and they usually openly display their demonic powers. For a certain duration of the series, they had an interest in publishing yaoi dōjinshi featuring Tōka. :; :: (PC), Oma Ichimura (PS2), Maria Yamamoto (anime) :; :: (PC), Oma Ichimura (PS2), Akeno Watanabe (anime) :; :: (PC), Oma Ichimura (PS2), Noriko Shitaya (anime) Media=Manga A manga adaptation titled , written by Aguri Soragata and illustrated by Yukio Kumoya, was serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Comptiq between December 10, 2005 and 2008.

He was known also as the Abbé de Lévignac. He was of noble birth, being a member of the MacCarthy Reagh family of Springhouse, Bansha, Co. Tipperary in Ireland who were Princes of Carbery and who subsequently became Counts of Toulouse in France. Biography Nicholas was born in Dublin, but left Ireland for Toulouse with his parents when he was four years of age.New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia Over the succeeding six decades he dedicated his life to preaching throughout France and Europe. Tuite MacCarthy, who grew up at the family's palatial townhouse at 3, Rue Mage in the city of Toulouse was profoundly affected by the death in child-birth of a sister-in-law, wife of Viscount (later Count) Robert MacCarthy, deputy for the Drome in 1815-20. He then resolved to study for the priesthood, which he did, firstly in the College du Plessis, and afterwards at the Sorbonne, Paris. On account of the Revolution, which broke out in France in May, 1789, and subsequently as the result of an accident whereby his spine was strained when he fell from a rickety stairs as he was carrying an immense bundle of firewood, to a frail old woman in an attic, his college career was interrupted. When his health had sufficiently improved, he resumed his theological studies in 1813, at the age of forty-four years in the seminary of Chambéry, Savoie, and returned to complete his studies in Paris. He was ordained to the priesthood on 19 June 1814, in his forty-sixth year. On his ordination, his strength was restored sufficiently for the exercise of his sacerdotal duties. Toulouse was the scene of his first missionary labours, and he became known as l'Abbe MacCarthy, and was referred to also as l'Abbe de Levignac, after an estate which his father had purchased near Bordeaux, Gironde. In a short time he became famous as a preacher and theologian, and besides his eminent qualifications as an ecclesiastic, he was endowed with poetical talent, and composed Latin verse of a high order of merit. He preached in the presence of many distinguished audiences, even in Switzerland and in Rome. Louis XVIII, King of France, nominated him, in accordance with a privilege then existing in that country, to the Bishopric of Montauban, Tarn et Garonne, and the nomination was confirmed by Pope Pius VII. In his deep humility, Abbe MacCarthy did not accept the episcopal office, and when close to fifty years old, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1818. After a course of Lenten sermons at Annecy, Savoie, concluding on Easter Sunday, 7 April 1833, he was taken ill, and having expired in the Bishop's Palace in his 64th year, he was buried in the Cathedral there. Background Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy was the second son of the eleven children of Count Justin MacCarthy of Toulouse (18 August 1744 – 1811), who was born at Spring House, near Bansha in County Tipperary and Maria (Mary) Winifred Tuite (Sept 1747-1822), daughter of Nicholas Tuite of St. Croix having relocated from the island of Montserrat.Genealogical Office of Ireland Manuscript Collection, N.L.I., (GO Mss 175, pp 61-64) Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy's uncle, Robert Tuite, was chamberlain to the King of Denmark Genealogical Office of Ireland Manuscript Collection, N.L.I., (GO Mss 175, p 61.) The Catholic Encyclopedia mistakenly says that Nicholas's maternal grandfather was chamberlain to the King of Denmark. His maternal grandfather, Nicholas Tuite of St Croix, was the son of Richard Tuite of Tuitestown in County Westmeath. It was this Richard who fled Ireland as part of the Wild Geese in 1691 following an extraordinary family background in Ireland.Genealogical Office of Ireland Manuscript Collection, N.L.I., (GO Mss 161, p. 95) Richard was one of only two surviving sons (the other being Robert) of Walter Tuite of Tuitestown and his wife, Margaret O'More, daughter of David O'More of Portallen in County Laois. Richard's remaining eleven brothers, Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy's great granduncles, were all killed in the wars in Ireland in 1691.John Lodge Peerage of Ireland, Volume 3, 1789, pp. 25-28 References Category:Irish Jesuits Category:People from Dublin (city) Category:University of Paris alumni Category:1769 births Category:1833 deaths Category:MacCarthy dynasty Category:Irish emigrants to France Category:People from County Dublin Category:18th-century Irish clergy Category:19th-century Irish clergy ","title":"Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy"},{"id":"10450315","text":"Jerson Vanencio Monteiro (born April 28, 1985 in Luanda, Angola) is a professional soccer player.

It featured the vocal duo of tenor Billy Jones and bass/baritone Ernie Hare, who sang novelty songs. Career Jones and Hare were already established as soloists on phonograph records. One of Jones's better solos was \\"Mary Lou\\", while Hare scored with the Yuletide novelty \\"Santa Claus Hides in the Phonograph\\". In 1920 recording executive Gus Haenschen had them sing an accompaniment on a Brunswick recording. They went on to do numerous recordings for Brunswick Records, Edison, and other companies. Similarities between the two singers were often noted: same height, same weight, birthdays a few days apart. Fred Rabinstein, who worked with Edison, recalled: :They had amused themselves by singing opera in a burlesque fashion, as they [later] did in their 1922 record of \\"Operatic Syncopation\\"...They seemed to have everything in common except that Jones was a bachelor (he took a wife after his mother's death) and Hare was married, with a little girl named Marilyn, who was to serve for a short time as Jones's singing partner after her father's death in 1939... both had mothers whose maiden names were Roberts; both were five feet and seven inches tall; both had voices of operatic calibre that perfectly complemented each other, and both had had operatic experience.Gracyk, Tim. Popular Acoustic Era Recording Artists, \\"The Happiness Boys -- Comic Team of Billy Jones and Ernest Hare.\\" They began on radio October 18, 1921 on WJZ (Newark, New Jersey), where they were sponsored by the chain of Happiness Candy stores. Listeners mailed in their comments about the singers on cards supplied to retailers by Happiness Candy.Banks, Michael A. \\"Collector's Corner: Early Radio Applause Cards,\\" Auction Bytes #180, December 3, 2006. Beginning August 22, 1923, the Happiness Boys broadcast on New York's WEAF, moving to NBC from a run from 1926 to 1929. The duo sang popular tunes, mostly light fare and comic songs, and they engaged in humorous repartee between numbers. Their theme song was \\"How Do You Do\\" (1924). However, only the words to this song were new at that time. The melody had been used for a variety of other songs in the past and is still used in the camp favorite \\"If You're Happy and You Know It (Clap Your Hands)\\". Edison Records \\"Diamond Disc\\" label, early 1920s, featuring the Happiness Boys Dave Kaplan was usually the team's pianist on records. Kaplan was in charge of Edison's popular music division (and led the company's house dance bands \\"Kaplan's Melodists\\", the anagrammatical \\"McNalpak's Dance Orchestra\\", and \\"Atlantic Dance Orchestra\\"), but his contract as Edison's bandleader did not restrict his piano accompaniment work on other labels; he was so identified with Jones and Hare that they were jocularly referred to as \\"The Happiness Boys with Dave Kaplan at the Piano\\" in a single phrase. Fannie Heinline, regarded as the best American female banjoist at the turn of the century, made guest appearances on The Happiness Boys as banjoist and vocalist. By 1928, Jones and Hare were the highest paid singers in radio, earning $1,250 a week. They also made highly successful personal appearances in the United States and Europe. (They mention the European tour fondly in their recording of \\"We Don't Like It, Not Much\\".) Jones and Hare specialized in comic songs that commented on trends and popular culture. When the song \\"Collegiate\\" swept the country and prompted a host of similar tunes, Jones and Hare countered with \\"We Ain't Never Been to College\\". Gracious living and social propriety were skewered in Jones and Hare's \\"Etiquette Blues\\". America's fascination with radio triggered the pungent parody \\"Twisting the Dials\\", probably the very first comedy sketch of its kind: Billy and Ernie simulate tuning a radio and getting snatches of random radio programs (Ernie's stentorian recitation of \\"Gunga Din\\" interrupted by Billy singing a fast Hawaiian song, Billy saccharinely introducing children's storyteller \\"Daddy Scarem\\" [Ernie] who turns out to be pretty grim, an incomprehensible boxing match, etc., punctuated by frequent time-outs for station identifications and time signals). One of their most pointed satires, recorded with a full orchestra, was \\"We Can't Sleep in the Movies Anymore\\". Jones and Hare demonstrate how talking pictures have changed a restful evening in a theater into a noisy onslaught of \\"sneezes, squawks, and squeals\\". The lyrics also note that the actors' voices seldom matched their silent screen images: HARE: The sheik is from the ghetto. I thought he came from Spain. JONES: His voice is high falsetto! And he sounds like he's in pain! Jones and Hare kidded the \\"talkies\\", but were featured in A Movietone Divertissement (MGM, 1928) and Rambling 'Round Radio Row #4 (Warner Brothers/Vitaphone, 1932), both sound short subjects. Radio's \\"Happiness Boys\\" changed their identities and allegiance whenever they changed sponsors. For Taystee Bread, for example, Jones and Hare became \\"The Taystee Loafers\\", and for Interwoven Socks they became \\"The Interwoven Pair\\". Regardless of their affiliation, they continued with their songs and jokes through the 1930s. The partnership ended with Ernie Hare's death on March 9, 1939. Hare's 16-year-old daughter, Marilyn Hare, joined Jones at the microphone, allowing the act to continue as \\"Jones and Hare\\" for about a year, until she left to pursue a movie career in Hollywood. In 1953, a classic vaudeville performance by the Happiness Boys was included in The Ford 50th Anniversary Show, a live television audience of 60 million persons (broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks). The audio of the Happiness Boys was accompanied by a pantomime performance by Mary Martin and Ethel Merman. Billy Jones and Ernie Hare's music was recently reissued on the Living Era CD (AJA 5628), How Do You Do?, which brings together two dozen of their more popular hits, including \\"Barney Google\\" (lyrics by Billy Rose), \\"Does the Spearmint Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost Overnight?\\" (1924, revived in 1959 by Lonnie Donegan), \\"I've Never Seen a Straight Banana\\", \\"Etiquette Blues\\", \\"I Miss My Swiss (My Swiss Miss Misses Me)\\", \\"Twisting the Dials\\", \\"The Village Blacksmith Owns the Village Now\\", \\"Yes! We Have No Bananas\\" (Billy Jones solo), and \\"She's the Sweetheart of Six Other Guys\\" (parody of \\"Sweetheart of Sigma Chi\\").

McColligan's footballing career started when he was a seventeen- year-old, in the youth ranks of Celtic, where he was a squad member from 1997 to 2001. Having made one appearance for Celtic, during the 1999–2000 season, he was signed on loan by Stenhousemuir halfway through the 2000–01 season. A successful three-month spell saw him score one goal, against future club Queen of the South, from deep in midfield. Subsequently, McColligan's career was to take him away from Celtic Park and to Clydebank, who he joined in September 2001. At Clydebank he scored once against Morton. In the close season of 2002 McColligan signed for Queen of the South, who had just been promoted from Division Two. This was the perfect opportunity for the team to build on the squad with which they wished to consolidate their league status, and McColligan, along with then-teammates Eric Paton and Martin Glancy, was to prove part of the team's plans. Queen of the South were, in that same season, to win the Scottish League Challenge Cup, with McColligan a member of the victorious final team. McColligan lasted in the Queen of the South team until November 2005. Immediately after what was to prove his final game, a 5–2 defeat to Hamilton Academical, in which he was sent off, McColligan signed for Alloa Athletic, in an attempt to save the team from relegation. While Alloa finished second-bottom in the 2005–06 table, they won the playoff final against Berwick Rangers, consolidating their position in the Second Division. While Alloa continue to occupy the lower half of Division Two, McColligan struggles for goal-scoring form, something which has eluded him since his days at Queen of the South. McColligan remains a tough-tackling midfielder who gels the team together with his attacking attitude as much as his popularity with the fans. In July 2007 McColligan left Alloa to sign for Bathgate Thistle. He won the Scottish Junior Cup in 2008 with Thistle, after the team defeated Cumnock Juniors 2–1 at Rugby Park.

He was the oldest son of the founding emperor Emperor Gaozu (Li Yuan) and the crown prince after the founding of the dynasty in 618 CE. Li Jiancheng was murdered by his younger brother, Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin, in the Xuanwu Gate indident in 626. His sons were subsequently executed or excluded from the imperial clan. After Li Shimin took the throne, Li Jiancheng was posthumously stripped of his crown prince status and granted the title \\"Prince Yin of Xi\\" (息隐王). Later, he was buried with the ceremonies due to an imperial prince. In 642, Li Jiancheng's title of Crown Prince Yin (隐太子) was restored.  Background  Li Jiancheng was born in 589 during the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui. He was the oldest son of Li Yuan, then Duke of Tang, who was a hereditary noble, and Li Yuan's wife Duchess Dou, who was the daughter of Dou Yi (竇毅), the Duke of Shenwu and Northern Zhou's Princess Xiangyang. Duchess Dou would subsequently give birth to three of Li Jiancheng's younger brothers: Li Shimin, Li Xuanba (李玄霸, who died in 614), and Li Yuanji. She also gave birth to a girl child who eventually became Princess Pingyang, although it is not clear whether she was older or younger than Li Jiancheng. At some point, Li Jiancheng received the title of Heir Apparent of Tang.  Participation in Tang's founding =The rebellion against Sui rule In 616, with rebellions beginning to engulf northern China and frequent Eastern Tujue incursions across the border, Emperor Yang of Sui commissioned Li Yuan to be the commander of Taiyuan, guarding it against both rebels and the Eastern Tujue. As the chief commander of Taiyuan, Li Yuan was obligated by law to leave his family behind. Li Jiancheng was therefore put in charge of the estate and became the head of the house of Hedong (河東, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) while Li Yuan was away.The New Book of Tang, Scroll 79.《新唐書》卷七十九：“...留建成護家...” Li Yuan took his younger son Li Shimin with him to the city Jinyang, which was the administrative center of Taiyuan. According to the traditional narrative in the official historical records, in 617 Li Yuan was persuaded by Li Shimin to rebel against Sui rule (see \\"Historical sources\\" below). Another source, Wen Daya (溫大雅)'s Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu (大唐創業起居注), attributes the decision to revolt to Li Yuan himself.Wen Daya 溫大雅, Da Tang chuangye qiju zhu 大唐創業起居注 (ca. 626; Shanghai: Shanghai guji publishing house, 1983), 1.2. When Li Yuan was initially assigned to Jinyang in 616, he was pleased and regarded his assignment as a divinely-granted opportunity.Wen Daya 溫大雅, Da Tang chuangye qiju zhu 大唐創業起居注：\\"私喜此行，以為天授。\\" But just one year later, in 617, Li Yuan said to Li Shimin: \\"The Sui Empire is about to collapse and the next family to rule this country will be us. The only reason I haven't yet started a rebellion is because your brothers are still in Hedong\\".Wen Daya 溫大雅, Da Tang chuangye qiju zhu 大唐創業起居注：”隋历将尽，吾家继膺符命，不早起兵者，顾尔兄弟未集耳。今遭羑里之厄(意指遭受囚禁)，尔昆季须会盟津之师，不得同受孥戮，家破身亡，为英雄所笑。“ Li Yuan sent secret messengers to Hedong to transfer his family to Jinyang. During the journey one of Li Jiancheng's younger brothers, Li Zhiyun, died. He also summoned his son-in-law Chai Shao from Chang'an. At the urging of Li Yuan's daughter, Chai Shao left Chang'an on his own while she went into hiding. Even before Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and Chai Shao arrived at Jinyang, Li Yuan rebelled, declaring that he intended to support Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You, the Prince of Dai, as emperor, while honoring Emperor Yang as Taishang Huang (retired emperor). Yang You was nominally in charge of the capital city Chang'an at the time. Li Yuan made both Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin key generals, and in nine days they captured Xihe Commandery (西河, roughly modern Lüliang, Shanxi), impressing their father. Subsequently, Li Yuan divided his forces into six armies, giving Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin command of three armies each. He also made Li Jiancheng the Duke of Longxi and Li Shimin the Duke of Dunhuang. Li Yuan then advanced toward Chang'an. As he approached Hedong, torrential rains prevented his army from advancing further. With rumors running rampant that Liu Wuzhou and the Eastern Tujue were about to attack Taiyuan, Li Yuan initially ordered a retreat back to Taiyuan. However, Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin argued that this would mean sure defeat, and Li Yuan changed his mind. Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin then captured the fortress of Huoyi (霍邑, in modern Linfen, Shanxi), eventually convincing Li Yuan to bypass Hedong and directly advance toward Chang'an. After he crossed the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang'an region), he sent Li Jiancheng with Liu Wenjing (劉文靜) east to guard Tong Pass and Yongfeng Storage (永豐倉) and to stop any potential Sui reinforcements from the eastern capital Luoyang. He also sent Li Shimin north of the Wei River to seize territory. Once Li Yuan himself approached Chang'an, he summoned both Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin to join him in a siege of Chang'an. In the winter of 617, Li Yuan captured Chang'an and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong). He was created Prince of Tang, and became the regent for Yang You. In the spring of 618, Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin toward Luoyang, which was then under attack by the rebel leader Li Mi, Duke of Wei, ostensibly to help the Sui forces there. The Sui forces rejected the overture, and Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin returned to Chang'an. Tang imperial reunification Later in the spring of 618, Emperor Yang, then at Jiangdu (江都, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), was killed in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When this news arrived at Chang'an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him. He established the Tang Dynasty, and declared himself the Emperor Gaozu. He also made Li Jiancheng crown prince. In 619, Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng to attack the peasant rebel leader Zhu Shanhai (祝山海), the Duke of Huxiang. Li Jiancheng defeated Zhu. Later that year Li Gui, the Emperor of Liang, was captured in a coup by his official An Xinggui (安興貴), who then surrendered to Tang. Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng to welcome An and to escort Li Gui to Chang'an, where An was executed by Li Yuan. Meanwhile, Li Jiancheng was developing a reputation for leniency but was addicted to drinking and hunting. Li Yuan was worried that he was ignorant about politics and uninterested in working for the state. He added his key ministers Li Gang (李綱) and Zheng Shanguo (鄭善果) to Li Jiancheng's staff. Campaigns against Tujue On July 1, 620, Li Shimin was sent to fight Wang Shichong. In the fall of 620, reports came in that Li Zhongwen (李仲文), who was then in charge at Taiyuan, was planning to rebel. Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng to Pufan (蒲反, i.e., Hedong) to guard against Li Zhongwen, while summoning Li Zhongwen back to the capital. Li Zhongwen complied and was later executed. In spring 621 the Xiongnu chieftain Liu Xiancheng (劉仚成) harassed Tang's border territory. Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng to attack Liu. Li Jiancheng captured a number of the Xiongnu and released their leaders. This led them to surrender in large numbers, and he then massacred them. Only Liu escaped and fled to Liang Shidu, the Emperor of Liang. In 622, Li Jiancheng was one of the commanders that Li Yuan sent, along with Li Shimin, Li Zihe (李子和), and Duan Decao (段德操), to counter an Eastern Tujue incursion.  Rivalry with Li Shimin  Meanwhile, an intense rivalry had developed between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, who now carried the title Prince of Qin. Although Li Jiancheng had made contributions towards Tang's reunification of China, Li Shimin had defeated a number of the most important contenders including Xue Rengao, the Emperor of Qin, Wang Shichong, the Emperor of Zheng, and Dou Jiande, the Prince of Xia. Li Shimin therefore had a stronger reputation in the army. Li Yuanji was also often relied on by Li Yuan as a general and had been created the Prince of Qi. He supported Li Jiancheng in his rivalry with Li Shimin, and often pushed Li Jiancheng toward a more hard-line position, wanting to be crown prince when Li Jiancheng became emperor. Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had better relations with Li Yuan's favored young concubines than Li Shimin did (their mother Duchess Dou had died before Tang's establishment), and those concubines helped rehabilitate Li Jiancheng's standing before Li Yuan. Li Yuan had considered making Li Shimin crown prince instead of Li Jiancheng, but his concubines persuaded him not to. By winter 622, the only remaining major threat against Tang rule was Liu Heita, the Prince of Handong. He had been a Xia general, and rose against Tang after Li Yuan had executed Dou Jiande. He had been defeated by Li Shimin earlier in the year. Li Jiancheng's staff members Wang Gui and Wei Zheng argued to him that he needed some victories to establish his reputation, and Li Jiancheng volunteered to command the army against Liu Heita. Li Yuan sent Li Jiancheng to attack Liu, assisted by Li Yuanji. Around the turn of the year, Liu's forces were bogged down while attacking Tang's Wei Prefecture (魏州, in modern Handan, Hebei). Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji engaged him at Guantao, crushing him. Liu fled north toward the Eastern Tujue, but was ambushed and captured by his own official Zhuge Dewei (諸葛德威), who delivered him to Li Jiancheng. Li Jiancheng executed Liu. China was by this point almost completely unified by Tang. In 623, when the Eastern Tujue made another incursion into Tang territory, Li Yuan again sent Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin to guard against the attack. Meanwhile Li Yuanji suggested to Li Jiancheng that he could have Li Shimin assassinated when Li Shimin was visiting Li Yuanji's mansion, but Li Jiancheng refused, not having the heart to kill a brother. In 624, Li Jiancheng requisitioned a number of soldiers from the general Li Yi, the Prince of Yan, to supplement his guard corps. This was against Li Yuan's regulations. Li Yuan rebuked Li Jiancheng when he found out, and exiled his guard commander Keda Zhi (可達志). Nevertheless, Li Jiancheng later requested the commandant at Qing Prefecture (慶州, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), Yang Wen'gan (楊文幹) to conscript troops, presumably to guard against Li Shimin. The officers Erzhu Huan (爾朱煥) and Qiao Gongshan (橋公山) informed Li Yuan that Li Jiancheng was encouraging Yang to start a rebellion so that they could seize power together. Li Yuan, then at Renzhi Palace (仁智宮, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi), was incensed, and summoned Li Jiancheng, then at Chang'an, to Renzhi Palace. Li Jiancheng briefly flirted with the idea of occupying Chang'an instead of accepting the order, but eventually reported to Renzhi Palace to request forgiveness. Li Yuan put him under arrest. When Yang heard this, Yang rebelled, and Li Yuan sent Li Shimin to attack Yang. Li Yuan promised Li Shimin that he would replace Li Jiancheng as crown prince, and that Li Jiancheng would be sent to the modern Sichuan region as the Prince of Shu. After Li Shimin left, however, Li Yuanji, Li Yuan's concubines, and the chancellor Feng Deyi, all spoke on Li Jiancheng's behalf, and Li Yuan changed his mind, released Li Jiancheng, and allowed him to return to Chang'an as crown prince. Li Yuan then blamed the discord between his sons on Li Jiancheng's staff members Wang Gui and Wei Ting (韋挺), and Li Shimin's staff member Du Yan, exiling them. Yang was subsequently assassinated by his own subordinates. Later that year, Li Yuan, troubled by repeated Eastern Tujue incursions, seriously considered burning Chang'an to the ground and moving the capital to Fancheng, a suggestion that Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and the chancellor Pei Ji agreed with. Li Shimin opposed the plan, however, and it was not carried out. Meanwhile, Li Shimin sent his confidants to Luoyang to build up personal control of the army there. The Poisoned Wine at Eastern Palace According to Zizhi Tongjian,Zizhi Tongjian, Scroll 191.《资治通鉴·卷第一百九十一·唐纪七》 on the first day of the 6th lunar month of 626, three days before the Xuanwu Gate incident, Li Jiancheng hosted a banquet for Li Shimin and Li Yuanji at his residence, the Eastern Palace. Li Shimin was carried back home after a night of drinking. Li Shimin reported through officials at his residence that he started vomiting a lot of blood after returning home. Li Yuan sent a royal decree to Li Jiancheng: \\"The prince of Qin (Li Shimin) has a low alcohol tolerance, therefore, he is forbidden to go out drinking at night.\\" Li Shimin apparently interpreted the wine as an assassination attempt, but Li Yuan did not mention poison in his decree to Li Jiancheng. Li Yuan considered sending Li Shimin to guard Luoyang to prevent further conflict, but Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji opposed the plan because they believed that this would give Li Shimin an opportunity to build up his personal power. They expressed their concerns to Li Yuan's ministers, who explained to him that this plan could escalate a brotherly rivalry into a civil conflict. Li Yuan therefore did not carry out the plan. The date and the veracity of this event are both disputed. According to Zizhi Tongjian, it happened 3 days before the Xuanwu Gate incident. In Li Jiancheng's biography from the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, it took place after the Yang Wen'gan incident but several months before the Xuanwu Gate incident. However, in Fang Xuanling's biography from the Old Book of Tang, it happened before the founding of Tang, and wine was not mentioned.Fang Xuanling biography in \\"the Old Book of Tang\\"《旧唐书·房玄龄传》 It remains a mystery whether or not someone attempted to poison Li Shimin at the Eastern Palace.  Death  By 626, Li Shimin was fearful that he would be killed by Li Jiancheng, and his staff members Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Zhangsun Wuji were encouraging Li Shimin to attack Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji first. Similarly, Wei Zheng was encouraging Li Jiancheng to attack Li Shimin first. Li Jiancheng persuaded Li Yuan to remove Fang and Du, as well as Li Shimin's trusted guard officers Yuchi Gong and Cheng Zhijie (程知節), from Li Shimin's staff. Zhangsun, who remained on Li Shimin's staff, continued to try to persuade Li Shimin to attack first. In summer 626, the Eastern Tujue were making another attack. Li Yuan was initially inclined to send Li Shimin to resist them, but at Li Jiancheng's suggestion sent Li Yuanji instead. Li Yuanji was given command of much of the army previously under Li Shimin's control. This further troubled Li Shimin, who believed that with the army in Li Yuanji's hands he would be unable to resist an attack. Li Shimin had Yuchi secretly summon Fang and Du back to his mansion, then sent an accusation to Li Yuan that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were committing adultery with Li Yuan's concubines. Li Yuan responded by issuing summonses to Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji for the next morning, convening the senior officials Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, and Chen Shuda to examine Li Shimin's accusations. As Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached the central gate leading to Li Yuan's palace, Xuanwu Gate (玄武門), Li Shimin ambushed them. He personally fired the arrow that killed Li Jiancheng, and Yuchi killed Li Yuanji. Li Shimin's forces entered the palace and, under this intimidation, Li Yuan agreed to make Li Shimin crown prince. Two months later, Li Shimin succeeded to the throne. Li Jiancheng's five sons were all executed. Li Jiancheng was initially reduced to commoner rank. After Emperor Taizong took the throne, he posthumously granted Li Jiancheng the title of Prince of Xi and assigned his own son Li Fu (李福) into Li Jiancheng's lineage as Li Jiancheng's heir. He also buried Li Jiancheng with the ceremonies due to an imperial prince. In 642, he restored Li Jiancheng's crown prince title. However, Li Jiancheng was never fully rehabilitated and his daughters still had the status of daughters of a common prince, rather than a crown prince.  Historical sources =Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu \\"Qijuzhu\\" is a type of imperial diary which records the emperor's daily activities that appeared as early as the Han dynasty. The purpose of Qijuzhu is to help govern the emperor's behavior by faithfully recording the actions and words of the Emperor in court. The emperor must not read or ask about the Qijuzhu. In the Tang dynasty, imperial diarists were in charge of the Qijuzhu. According to convention, the Qijuzhu should be edited and the original diary destroyed after the death of the emperor.Li Bingzhong, Wei Canjin, Lin Conglong, ed. (1990). 簡明文史知識詞典 (Xi'an: Shaanxi renmin chubanshe), 694. The author of Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu (大唐创业起居注, \\"Imperial diary of the foundation of the Great Tang\\") was Wen Daya (c. 572 - 629 CE). He served as Li Yuan's staff of records and witnessed the establishment of Tang dynasty in 618. Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu was a three-chapter book with a detailed narrative and a firsthand account of the 357 days of insurrection. His work was finished before Li Shimin began censoring the official imperial records. Since Wen Daya was a supporter of Li Shimin,Wen Dayai's biography is in the old book of Tang 《旧唐书·温大雅传》 he did not feel a need to exaggerate Li Jiancheng's contribution to Tang's founding. As the only complete original court diary left from pre-Qing times, Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu is now generally considered a more reliable source on early Tang Dynasty..Bingham, Woodbridge. \\"Wen Ta-ya: The First Recorder of T'ang History.\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 57 (1937): 368-74. Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu emphasizes that Li Yuan was the mastermind of the revolt against the Sui. Li Shimin, who was a teenager at the time, served only a secondary role in these events. Li Shimin made no greater contribution than Li Jiancheng to the founding of the Tang empire. In the official histories, Li Jiancheng was described as an incompetent crown prince, alcoholic spendthrift and playboy, spending most of his time hunting for fun.Li Jian cheng biography in \\"the Old Book of Tang\\"《旧唐书·隐太子建成传》: “资简弛...” Li Yuan was also described as incompetent, a mediocre coward lacking ambition in the official histories. However, Wen Daya portrayed a different Li Jiancheng: a capable leader, generous and open-minded. He knew how to recruit talented people and did well in his early political career as a crown prince. Li Yuan, in Wen Daya's narrative, was a fearless leader with vision, courage and strategic planning. In recent years historians have re-examined the evidence for events contained in the official histories (the Old Book of Tang, the New Book of Tang and Zizhi Tongjian) and have concluded that important elements were probably fabricated during the reign of Li Shimin at his order. On the basis of other material, most importantly Da-Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu, historians have been able to correct some of the bias and distortions of the official histories about the founding of the Tang dynasty.Lo Hsiang-lin, T'ang-tai wen- huashih (Taipei, 1955), pp. 1-29Li Shu-t'ung 李樹桐, Tangsbih k'ao-pien 唐史考辨 (Taipei 台北, 1965), pp. 1-98, 276-30Fukui Shigemasa, 'Dai To sogyo kikyo-chu ko', Shikan, 63.4 (1961) 83-8The Cambridge History of China, Volume 3, \\"Sui and T'ang. China, 589-906, Part I,\\" edited by Denis Twitchett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979 Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu provides a clear example of how Li Shimin, who murdered his own brothers and deposed his father, had history rewritten in his own favor. It also explains many self- contradictions found in the official histories. The truth that had intentionally been distorted and ignored by later official historians can be found in the Da Tang Chuangye Qijuzhu.Zhang Zexian (1992). \\"Da-Tang chuangye qijuzhu 大唐創業起居注\\", in Encyclopedia of China 中国大百科全书, Chinese history 中国历史 (Beijing/Shanghai: Encyclopedia of China Publishing House), Vol. 1, 146.

She was built especially for the Inside Passage to Alaska and was reputedly the most luxurious steamer engaged on that run. As a consequence, she was favoured by many wealthy businessmen, speculators, bankers, railroad tycoons and the like who had a stake in the lucrative Klondike gold fields. Wreck of Islander Headline announcing sinking of Islander, reporting 65 lives lost On 14 August 1901, Islander departed Skagway, Alaska for Victoria, British Columbia, filled to capacity with passengers and carrying a cargo of gold bullion valued at over $6,000,000 in 1901 dollars. Sometime after 2:00 am on 15 August 1901 while sailing down the narrow Lynn Canal south of Juneau, she struck what was reported to be an iceberg that stove a large hole in her forward port quarter. Attempts to steer the foundering vessel ashore on nearby Douglas Island were in vain; within five minutes, the tremendous weight of the water filling the ship's forward compartments had forced her bow underwater and her stern, rudder and propellers completely out of the water. After drifting for about 15 minutes in a strong southerly outbound tide, Islander began her final plunge to the bottom and sank quickly. She was reported to have carried 107 passengers and a crew of 61 during the last voyage. In total, 40 lives were lost, including the wife and daughter of politician James Hamilton Ross. Salvage attempts Reports concerning the substantial value of the ship's cargo led to many early salvage attempts and also several lawsuits. No sooner had Islander sunk than efforts began to locate the wreck. Within days, another ship, the SS Haling, was sounding the area in order to determine the wreck's depth. The first attempt to locate Islander was a failure. In 1902 Henry Finch, an experienced diver with 40 years' experience, dragged the bottom of the Lynn Canal for the wreck. He located the hull but was not able to proceed with an actual salvage attempt. 1904 In 1904, equipped with a specially designed barge and diving bell, Finch succeeded in locating the wreck of Islander in of water and reported a \\"gaping hole\\" in the ship's bow. Unfortunately, Finch did not have the means to gain access to the reported location of the gold in the Purser's Office amidships and as a result only a section of deck rail and grating were recovered. Over the next 25 years at least a dozen separate salvage attempts were made on Islander. Every operation succeeded in reaching the wreck, but none proved able to penetrate the ship's hold or recover any of the gold. Apart from the adverse weather conditions, the strong currents, and extremely cold temperatures, salvage from the depth at which the wreck lay was virtually unknown in the early 20th century. 1929 In 1929 Captain Wiley of Seattle teamed up with Frank Curtis, a professional housemover with experience in moving and transporting large structures. Their scheme involved leading 20 steel cables beneath the sunken liner that were to be connected to surface vessels. The cables were then to be tightened at each low tide, inching the wreck towards shore with each high tide. This challenging operation occupied two complete salvage seasons until, on 20 July 1934, Islander surfaced near Green's Cove, Admiralty Island, Alaska. The \\"gaping hole\\" first noted by Henry Finch in 1904 turned out to be more significant than suspected: of the Islander's bow, including the Mail and Storage Room, had been completely sheared off. However, it was the Purser's Office in the midsection of the vessel where Islander's gold was expected to be found. Disappointingly, when the wreck was cleared, Islander yielded only $75,000 worth of gold nuggets and gold dust. The Purser's Office disclosed none of the strongboxes of bullion that were expected; its safe contained just a handful of US $10 and $20 gold coins and some waterlogged paper currency. According to statements made by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) constables who were aboard the ship to guard the shipment of gold, the bullion had been stowed in a locker on the port side of the forward well deck, just abaft the break of the focsle – an area located within the \\"missing\\" bow section which was not located until August 1996. 1996 In 1996, OceanMar Inc. of Seattle raised capital in the USA and the UK to charter a suitable vessel and mount a salvage expedition equipped with an extensive sidescan sonar suite, and a \\"Surveyor\\" Remotely Operated Vehicle.Nick Messinger, SS Islander 1996 expedition On their arrival at Juneau, the expedition's ship, the MV Jolly Roger, was boarded by a US Deputy Marshal, and the expedition was served with a Temporary Restraining Order, obtained by a rival salvage company, Yukon Recovery of Seattle. Yukon Recovery claimed rights to the wreck on the grounds that they had salvaged a light fitting and a bottle, under the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act. OceanMar, who had extensively researched Islander asserted that the wreck had never been abandoned and their Salvage Agreement which was with the original insurers consequently took precedence. OceanMar were also able to show that they had located the bow section long before Yukon appeared on the scene. A meeting in Anchorage with a judge who was an expert in maritime law resulted in OceanMar being granted permission to survey and video the wreck site, on the strict understanding that nothing was to be removed from the wreck. Jolly Roger and her crew spent the following five weeks recording every aspect of the bow section and side-scanning the debris field lying between the original point of impact and the ship's final resting place. Islander's bow section was located on the 95th anniversary of the sinking, almost to the hour. OceanMar then found themselves involved in four years of legal action with Yukon Recovery, resulting in the United States courts of appeals finding in favour of OceanMar on 7 March 2000. In 2004, the company was still trying to raise the capital needed to mount a new salvage effort.Via Internet Archive NotesReferences * SS Islander 1996 expedition at nickmessinger.co.uk; retrieved 6 October 2020 * Category:1888 ships Category:1901 in Alaska Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:Maritime incidents in 1901 Category:Shipwrecks of the Alaska coast Category:Steamships of Canada Category:Ships sunk by icebergs ","title":"SS Islander"},{"id":"10450444","text":"Dr. Santos station is an under construction on the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1.

The continuous problem is broken into n discrete intervals; quadrature or numerical integration determines the weights and locations of representative points for the integral. The problem becomes a system of linear equations with n equations and n unknowns, and the underlying function is implicitly represented by an interpolation using the chosen quadrature rule. This discrete problem may be ill-conditioned, depending on the original problem and the chosen quadrature rule. Since the linear equations require O(n^3) operations to solve, high-order quadrature rules perform better because low-order quadrature rules require large n for a given accuracy. Gaussian quadrature is normally a good choice for smooth, non- singular problems.  Discretization of the integral  Standard quadrature methods seek to represent an integral as a weighed sum in the following manner: :\\\\int_a^b h (x) \\\\;\\\\mathrm d x \\\\approx \\\\sum_{k=1}^n w_k h (x_k) where w_k are the weights of the quadrature rule, and points x_k are the abscissas.  Example  Applying this to the inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the second kind :f (x) = \\\\lambda u (x) - \\\\int_a^b K (x, x') f (x') \\\\;\\\\mathrm d x', results in :f (x) \\\\approx \\\\lambda u (x) - \\\\sum_{k=1}^n w_k K (x, x_k) f (x_k).

At Pro Tour Los Angeles, Tsumura made the top eight for a third time in one season, once again losing to the eventual winner, Antoine Ruel, this time in the semifinals. In addition to his three Pro Tour top eights, Tsumura also reached the top eight of four Grand Prix events. At the end of the season, he earned the Player of the Year award, besting Olivier Ruel 84 points to 83. He did so without ever having made day two of a Limited format Pro Tour, so he made it his goal to improve in this format the following season. He succeeded with this goal, winning back to back Grand Prix events at Kuala Lumpur and Toulouse, both of which were Limited.

Preface  The preface of the book includes a story often referred to as \\"God made man because He loves stories.\\" The story imagines that a series of historical Hasidic leaders each followed a 3-step ritual for accomplishing the rescue of his respective community through a miracle. The founder of the tradition was Yisroel ben Eliezer (Baal Shem Tov and the three steps were to go to a specific area of a forest to meditate, say a specific prayer and light a fire. However, each of the subsequent leaders each forgot a step of the ritual that had been passed on to him. Dov Ber of Mezeritch remembered two of the three steps, Moshe-leib of Sasov knew one of the two steps passed on to him, but Israel Friedman of Ruzhyn couldn't even remember the single step that he had been given. He said to God, \\"...All I can do is to tell the story....\\" Yet even just remembering the story about the tradition was, as he hoped, sufficient for obtaining the needed miracle.

The film was written and directed by Jacques Demy, with music composed by his regular collaborator Michel Legrand. The French-Japanese co-production was produced by Mataichiro Yamamoto for Kitty Films, Nippon TV, and Toho, and was filmed on location in France. Catriona MacColl stars as the eponymous Oscar François de Jarjayes, with Barry Stokes as her lover André Grandier, alongside Jonas Bergström, Christine Böhm, Mark Kingston, Georges Wilson, Sue Lloyd, Martin Potter, and Anouska Hempel. A young Lambert Wilson appears in a minor role. Plot Oscar François de Jarjayes is a young woman whose father, a career military man, wanted a boy. After she was born her father took to dressing Oscar in boy's clothes and raising her as a man. Privately Oscar acknowledges her feminine side, she dresses as a man and gains an honored position as a guard of Marie Antoinette. In her youth, Oscar is in love with Andre, the son of the family's housekeeper. Years later, when the French Revolution begins, Oscar and Andre's paths cross for the first time in years. With the assault on the Bastille, Oscar and Andre find themselves fighting on opposite sides of the revolution. CastProduction The major sponsor of the film was Shiseido, a cosmetics company, and Catriona McColl promoted a red lipstick for the spring cosmetic line that year. Frederik L. Schodt and Jared Cook translated the entire manga series into English as a reference for the producers of this film, but gave the only copy of the translation to them and it was lost. The production was based at Auditel Studios in Paris, with filming locations including Jossigny, Senlis, and the Palace of Versailles. Reception The film was not a commercial success, and MacColl's portrayal of Oscar, in particular, was criticized; it was felt by some critics that she was not androgynous enough to play Oscar. On Midnight Eye, Jasper Sharp says the film \\"is one of those works that is so compellingly awful that entire dissertations could be written about what exactly went wrong.\\" Anne Duggan chooses to view Lady Oscar within the context of Demy's other films. Duggan describes Ikeda's Oscar as having \\"much more self-knowledge\\" than the Oscar of the film, describing Demy's Oscar as being \\"in denial about sexual and class issues\\". Duggan feels that if agency is taken away from Oscar, it is given to lower- class characters in the film, in particular Andre. Variety described the film as recalling early Hollywood epics, and praised Catriona McColl's depiction of Oscar as a \\"woman waiting to burst out of a man's clothing\\".https://variety.com/1978/film/reviews/lady-oscar-1117792425/ Kevin Thomas, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described the film as a typical Jacques Demy film, noting its preoccupation with contrasting the lives of the aristocrats and the lives of the poor.

The company operated between 1957 and 1998. Founded by Professor Luigi Pascale, Partenavia became a limited company in 1959, and was acquired by the Italian state-owned aerospace firm Aeritalia during 1981. During the 1980s, the firm concentrated activity on the production of two aircraft, the P.68 twin-engined multi-mission transport and the P.66C Charlie trainer aircraft. During 1991, Partenavia was sold to Aercosmos; seven years later, the firm was declared bankrupt and was dissolved. Much of its assets were acquired by rival aircraft manufacturer Vulcanair, who continued the production and development of some parts of the company's former product range. History Partenavia was established in 1957 by Professor Luigi Pascale of Naples University; Pascale had been motivated to found the company with the purpose to creating aircraft that would be accessible to all people. That same year, the company acquired an existing factory located at Arzano in the Metropolitan City of Naples. Partenavia headquartered itself in the city as well. During 1959, it was reorganised as a limited company. P.68R in flight The first major aircraft to be produced by the company was the P.57 Fachiro, a four-seat high wing aircraft principally intended for the flying club sector. Several years later, an all-metal version, the Oscar, replaced the Fachiro on the production lines. Pascale proceeded to develop and produce a wide range of inhouse-designed aircraft. Perhaps the most well recognised of its designs was the twin-engined P.68, a light multi-mission transport aircraft that made its maiden flight during 1970. During 1981, Partenavia became a part of the Italian state-owned aerospace group Aeritalia; despite its new ownership, the firm received little financial support from its parent company. Thereafter, Partenavia concentrated its resources on the P.66C Charlie monoplane trainer aircraft, producing in excess of 100 for the Aero Club d'Italia. By 1986, the firm reportedly employed around 150 workers to manufacture two aircraft models, the P.66 and P.68. During the 1980s, the P68 was re-engined and marketed in the North American market under the Spartacus brand as a business aircraft, where roughly half of yearly sales were being made by this point in time. During 1993, Alenia sold the company to Aercosmos. Two years later, Indian firm Taneja Aerospace and Aviation assembled the first of its P.68 which it was building under licence in India. However, the company did not perform well overall under its new owner. In March 1998, Partenavia was declared bankrupt. During the company's liquidation, aircraft manufacturer Vulcanair, which was also founded by Pascale, acquired all of Partenavia's former assets, including design rights and trademarks. In addition to supporting the type, Vulcanair subsequently put the P.68 back into production under its own brand. Various upgrades and enhancements to former Partenavia aircraft have been implemented by Vulcanair.

He was originally trained in medicine by his father, a surgeon-major at a local military hospital. As a young man he moved to Paris, where he served as gagnant-maîtrise at the Salpêtrière. In 1750 he was appointed professor of physiology, a position he held for 40 years. In 1764 he was appointed lifetime secretary to the Académie Royale de Chirurgie. Louis published numerous articles on surgery, including several biographies of surgeons who died in his lifetime. He also published the surgical aphorisms of Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave (1668–1738). Louis is credited with designing a prototype of the guillotine. For a period of time after its invention, the guillotine was called a louisette. However, it was later named after French physician Joseph Ignace Guillotin (1738–1814), whose advocacy of a more humane method of capital punishment prompted the guillotine's design. The \\"angle of Louis\\" is another name for the sternal angle, which is the point of junction between the manubrium and the body of the sternum.

Born in Hithadhoo, Addu Atoll, Afeef was an educated and well-respected individual from a family of notables. Owing to his knowledge of the English language, he served as a translator to the British military at Gan airbase in the same atoll. His local name was Elha Didige Ali Didige Afifu. Abdullah Afeef was the breakaway nation's first and only president. The Suvadive government was unceremoniously dismantled by the British and the Maldive Islands' government representatives in 1963. Following this, Abdullah Afeef was exiled to the Seychelles where he died about 40 years later. Southern islanders still remember him fondly as \\"our Afeefu\\". Insurrection of the Addu Islanders During the 1950s, the government of the Maldive Islands (now Maldives) sought to implement certain centralizing measures. As a result, there was discontent in the Southern Atolls. In Addu Atoll there were riots against the central Maldive government in the year 1958. Among those who were involved in the uprising against the militiamen of the central government posted in Addu was Abdullah Afeefu. In Addu Atoll there was a British air base in the island of Gan. The new prime minister of the Maldive Islands had appointed Abdullah Afeef as the liaison officer between the British and the locals. Shortly afterwards, in December 1958, the government announced plans for a new tax on boats. This caused riots throughout the atoll again, leading to several attacks on Maldive government buildings. Once again, the officials of the Government of the Maldive Islands were forced to retreat to the safety of the British barracks. This time Abdullah Afeef saved the lives of the Maldive officials by warning them of the impending unrest. Afeef chosen as President of the Suvadive Islands Four days later, on a delegation of the Addu people arrived on Gan and declared their independence to the British. The delegation also demanded that Adullah Afeef be their leader. Afeef was chosen to lead the nascent Suvadive government because of British insistence that a trustworthy leader whom they were familiar with be chosen, as a precondition for them being able to back the secession. It is said that Afeef initially refused, and that he accepted the role of becoming the executive head of the new state only under heavy pressure. The fledgling Suvadive state was soon joined by the other two Southern Atolls, Huvadu and Fua Mulaku. In his first year as President, Afeef pleaded for support and recognition from Britain in the edition of The Times of London However, Afeefu's pleas went unheeded and the British Government never recognized the \\"United Suvadive Islands\\". Instead the initial British measure of lukewarm support for the small breakaway nation was withdrawn in 1961, when the British signed a treaty with the Maldive Islands without involving Afeef. Following that treaty the Suvadives had to endure an economic embargo and attacks from gunboats sent by the Maldive government. Without the support of the British, the Suvadive republic was on the brink of collapse. Exile Finally, in October 1963 the United Suvadive Republic was unceremoniously dismantled and the flag was hoisted over the main Suvadive government building in Hithadoo Island. Abdullah Afeef went into exile to the Seychelles with his immediate family aboard the British warship HMS Loch Lomond. The blame of the Suvadive \\"Rebellion\\" (Baghaavaiy) as it is still known in Maldives, was put squarely on Afeefu's shoulders and on the British. There was not much persecution by the Malé government afterwards and the Suvadive nation was slowly forgotten. Afeef was officially declared a traitor to the Maldives, and a puppet of the British. Still, most Southern Maldivians have a lot of respect for Afeef and claim that he was a gentleman, a man of integrity who did what he had to do in the circumstances. Despite having studied in Cairo, Egypt, Afeef had a secular and progressive outlook. Owing to his secularism and his admiration for the British, he was abjectly ridiculed and mocked as a \\"Kafir\\" or infidel by the press in Malé. But Afeef was an honest and kind person and was not like the typical corrupt, devious and self- righteous present-day politician. After 1963 Abdullah Afeef lived in Victoria, Mahe Island, in the Seychelles with his wife and children. From the Seychelles Afeef made repeated requests to the Maldive government to visit his home island Hitadhoo, to see his family, but the Maldivian authorities persistently ignored his requests. The Government in Malé didn't want to allow Abdullah Afeef to set foot in the Maldives again. Shortly before his death on , when he was old and in a precarious health condition, Afeef was permitted to travel to Addu to see his relatives. However, an official pardon was not granted. Perfidious Albion? The controversy around the Suvadive still endures and touches sensitive fibers of many Maldivians. The general blame for the secession is put on the scheming British and their fork-tonguedness. This is not only convenient, but it also has a ring of truth, for it would be not the first time that the British have played the role of villain behind the scenes. On one hand the British gave hopes to the trusting Suvadive islanders, legitimately afflicted by centralism and neglect. But on the other hand the same British later betrayed the Suvadive people by making a separate agreement with the government of the Maldive Islands behind the back of the islanders who trusted them fully. The inhabitants of the neighboring atoll group, the Chagossian Islanders or Ilois were ditched similarly by the British Government when the USA agreed to pay handsomely to lease the island of Diego Garcia as long as there would be no bothering natives close by. Genealogy President Afeef Didi was the son of Ali Didi son of Hithadhoo Elha Didi (Mohamed Didi) son of Kalhihaaru Dhon Ali Thakurufan of Meedhoo son of Dhondhiyege Faathumaifaan daughter of Elhagedharige Hussein Thakurufaan son of Kudhuraniage Ibrahim Thakurufan son of Kudhuraniage Faathumafaan daughter of Ibrahim Naib Thakurufaan son of Vazeeul Kabeer Mohamed Bodufuiy Thakurufaan son of Chief Justice Hussein Quthubuddeen son of Chief Justice Mohamed Shamsuddeen (also known as Addu Bodu Fandiyaaru Thakurufan).

Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930 (2007), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, ruling that criminal defendants sentenced to death may not be executed if they do not understand the reason for their imminent execution, and that once the state has set an execution date death-row inmates may litigate their competency to be executed in habeas corpus proceedings.. This decision reaffirmed the Court's prior holdings in Ford v. Wainwright,. and Stewart v. Martinez-Villareal.. Background In 1992 Scott Panetti killed his mother-in-law and his father-in-law, the parents of his second wife, Sonja Alvarado. He then held his wife and daughter hostage for the night, and surrendered to police the next morning. Three years later, Panetti was tried in a Texas state court for capital murder. Panetti sought to represent himself, and so the trial court ordered a competency hearing. Panetti was found to be suffering from a \\"fragmented personality, delusions, and hallucinations\\" for which he had been hospitalized over 12 times and for which he had been prescribed high doses of powerful psychiatric drugs for schizophrenia. Panetti's ex-wife testified at the competency hearing and described one of Panetti's psychotic episodes in 1986. During that episode, Panetti had \\"become convinced the devil had possessed their home and, in an effort to cleanse their surroundings, Panetti had buried a number of valuables next to the house and engaged in other rituals.\\" Even with this testimony, Panetti was found competent to be tried and to waive his right to counsel. A veteran of the US Navy, Panetti's defense at trial was that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. Standby counsel related that Panetti's behavior was \\"scary\\", \\"bizarre\\", and \\"trance-like.\\" It was evident to standby counsel, based on Panetti's behavior both in private and before the jury, that Panetti was not competent, and that his behavior made a farce and mockery of the judicial process. Panetti had also allegedly stopped taking his medication a few months before the trial. Indeed, two months after the end of the trial, the trial court found Panetti incompetent to waive his right to state habeas counsel. Nevertheless, Panetti was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. Panetti sought appellate review in the Texas courts, as well as state habeas relief. All these efforts were fruitless. The U.S. Supreme Court twice declined to review Panetti's case. Panetti then filed a federal habeas petition, which was denied, and that denial was affirmed by the Fifth Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court again declined to review the case. Once these federal habeas proceedings had ended, the state trial judge, Steven Ables, set an execution date of February 5, 2004. At this point, Panetti claimed that he was incompetent to be executed. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Panetti's appeal, and Panetti filed another federal habeas petition. On February 4, 2004, the federal district court stayed Panetti's execution in order to allow the state courts to adjudicate Panetti's claim of mental incompetence. The state trial court, in turn, appointed two mental health experts to evaluate Panetti. Lawyers defending Panetti were given a one-week notice to also acquire mental health experts to also evaluate Panetti. Both of the experts for the state concluded that Panetti was malingering in order to avoid execution. Panetti responded by arguing that the trial court's procedures did not comply with the procedures set forth in Ford v. Wainwright. The state trial court responded by closing the case, ruling that Panetti did not show he was incompetent to be executed. He did not appeal to either the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, he returned to federal court, where another hearing was held. After the hearing the district court concluded that the state courts had not complied with the procedural requirements of Ford. Nevertheless, it denied relief because, under Fifth Circuit precedent, it was enough that Panetti know simply that he was about to be executed and the \\"factual predicate\\" for the execution. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of Panetti's habeas petition, and on January 4, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on April 17, 2007, with Texas Solicitor General Ted Cruz appearing for the state.https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-6407 Opinion of the Court On June 27, 2008, the last day of the term, the Supreme Court reversed and remanded by a vote of 5-4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing for the majority. Jurisdiction The Court began its opinion by considering its jurisdiction. Panetti had not raised his claim that he was not competent to be executed – what lawyers call a Ford claim – in his first federal habeas petition. The Court therefore lacked jurisdiction to entertain it unless he could overcome the bar on \\"second or successive\\" habeas petitions imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). The term \\"second or successive\\" is a term of art; not every subsequent habeas petition is subject to AEDPA's bar on second or successive habeas petitions. The Court ruled that Panetti's petition was not barred as \\"second or successive\\" because his Ford claim did not become ripe until his execution was imminent. It rejected the State's contrary argument because of the perverse results it would have generated – inmates could be forced to litigate their competency to be executed before any signs of mental illness had set in. \\"An empty formality requiring prisoners to file unripe Ford claims neither respects the limited legal resources available to the States nor encourages the exhaustion of state remedies.\\" Accordingly, Panetti's Ford claim was not barred by the second-or- successive rule, and the Court had jurisdiction to entertain Panetti's appeal. Procedures for determining a Death Row inmate's competence to be executed Under Ford, once a prisoner seeking a stay of execution makes a \\"substantial threshold showing of insanity\\", he must be afforded a fair hearing at which the question of his competence to be executed can be resolved. This means he must have an \\"opportunity to be heard\\" by an impartial decisionmaker. In other words, the legal determination of his competence to be executed cannot rest solely on the determination of experts, because doing so would prevent the inmate from offering evidence to rebut any expert's opinion that he was competent to be executed. The Texas courts did not comply with these minimal procedures in Panetti's case. Panetti was entitled to the procedural protections of Ford because he had made the required threshold showing; indeed, if he had not done so, why had the state trial court appointed the mental health experts to evaluate him? The state courts refused to transcribe the proceedings, failed to keep Panetti's counsel apprised of the progress of Panetti's claim of incompetence, and arguably failed to hold the competency hearing required by Texas law. Most importantly, however, the Texas courts did not afford Panetti an opportunity to refute the opinions of the court-appointed experts. Although counsel had asked the trial court to give him money to hire experts of his own, the trial court ended the case without ruling on that request. These deficiencies in the procedures the Texas courts used to determine that Panetti was competent to be executed led the Court to conclude that Panetti did not receive the minimal process due him under Ford. Under AEDPA's standard for granting relief on a federal constitutional claim, the state court's resolution of that claim must be contrary to, or involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. Ford supplied the clearly established law by which to evaluate the Texas courts' treatment of Panetti's claim. And even though the Ford standard is stated in general terms, it was clear to the Court that the procedures the Texas courts employed did not fit the bill. Because the Texas courts had unreasonably applied Ford when they adjudicated Panetti's claim of incompetence, the Court was free to determine what the proper procedure should have been, and whether Panetti was, in fact, not competent to be executed. Substantive competency determinations under Ford At an evidentiary hearing in the federal district court, four experts testified on Panetti's behalf. One expert opined that Panetti suffered from schizo-affective disorder, resulting in a genuine delusion regarding the reason for his execution. The expert stated that Panetti believed that his execution was part of \\"spiritual warfare\\" between the \\"demons and the forces of the darkness and God and the angels and the forces of light.\\" Panetti understands that the State claims it is executing him for the murders, but believes that the State's reason is a sham and the real reason is that the State wants to stop Panetti from preaching. Panetti's other experts testified to similar conclusions. The State's witnesses conceded that Panetti was mentally ill, although they resisted the conclusion that Panetti was not competent to be executed. They pointed to the fact that at times Panetti was \\"clear and lucid\\", and could understand \\"certain concepts\\". Panetti's experts reminded the court that schizophrenia does not diminish a person's cognitive abilities, such that during short interactions the patient may appear lucid. Over time, however, the patient's mental illness would become apparent. Based on this testimony, the Fifth Circuit had held that Panetti's delusions did not render him incompetent. But the Court held that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of Ford had been \\"flawed\\". For the Fifth Circuit, three of the district conclusions were sufficient to sustain the ruling that Panetti was competent. First, Panetti knew that he had committed the murders. Second, Panetti knew that he was about to be executed. And third, Panetti knew that the State's given reason for executing him was the fact that he had committed the murders. These three facts allowed the Fifth Circuit to ignore the delusions that prevented Panetti from understanding that the reason for his execution was the fact that he had committed the murders. In the Fifth Circuit's view, Ford required mere awareness of the State's reason rather than a rational understanding of it. The Eighth Amendment forbids executing the insane because doing so offends human decency in that it serves neither the goal of retribution or deterrence. \\"The potential for a prisoner's recognition of the severity of the offense and the objective of community vindication are called into question, however, if the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.\\" This is what the Court in Ford was referring to when it held that an inmate who lacks a rational understanding of the reason for his execution. A death-row inmate who is \\"so callous as to be unrepentant, so self-centered and devoid of compassion as to lack all sense of guilt, so adept at transferring blame to others as to be considered, at least in the colloquial sense, to be out of touch with reality\\" may still have a \\"rational understanding\\" of the reason for his execution. Panetti's claim was that, by virtue of his mental illness, his psychotic disorder, he lacked such a \\"rational understanding\\". Both the Texas courts' procedural missteps and the Fifth Circuit's substantive definition of incompetence precluded consideration of this contention. Dissenting opinion Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from all three of the Court's legal conclusions – that Panetti's Ford claim was not second or successive, that the Texas courts did not afford Panetti the procedural protections required by Ford, and that the Fifth Circuit did not apply the correct substantive standard under Ford.

Ritvik representative of the Acharya In 1993, Hansadutta published a collection of essays, letters and articles under the title Srila Prabhupada, His Movement and You, in which he presented arguments and evidence in support of continuation of the parampara (disciplic succession) as a \\"ritvik\\", or representative, of Bhaktivedanta Swami. At this time Hansadutta redirected all his former \\"disciples\\" to regard Bhaktivedanta Swami as their spiritual master, and began to initiate new disciples on behalf of Bhaktivedanta Swami, as \\"ritvik representative of the Acharya\\". BBT courtcase In 1997, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust International, Inc. and ISKCON of California, Inc. initiated legal action against Hansadutta, seeking court declaration that Bhaktivedanta Swami's Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (California, 1972) was not a legal entity and/or Hansadutta was not a legal trustee of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust. On 13 November 1998, Hansadutta agreed to a stipulated court settlement that effectively terminated any claims he might have had to being a trustee of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust conditional upon receipt of an undisclosed cash settlement and license to publish the original, unrevised books of Bhaktivedanta Swami. Personal life Hansadutta's parents immigrated from Germany to the United States when he was nine or ten years old. Hansadutta was raised in New York City. At the age of 17, he joined the Navy, where he served from 1957 to 1961. In the early 1960s he and his first wife, Himavati devi dasi, were aspiring artists living in Hoboken, New Jersey, when they met Hare Krishna devotees at 26, Second Avenue in the lower East Side of Manhattan. In March, 1967 Hansadutta and Himavati moved to Montreal to assist with establishing the Hare Krishna center, and in May of the same year they were initiated by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, ISKCON Founder-Acharya, in New York. In 1976 Hansadutta took the order of sannyasa, and Himavati remarried a few years later. In 1984, Hansadutta married Lakshmi Kary-Rana, with whom he had three children. They later divorced. In 2003, Hansadutta suffered a heart attack. On 25 April 2020, Hansadutta passed from pancreatic cancer.

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) lists two variant names for the Entiat River: En-ti-at-kwa River and Entiatqua River. The river's name is derived from the Columbia-Moses (Salishan) term /nt'yátkw/ [nt'iátkw], meaning \\"place of grassy water\\"; another source states that it was called Enteatqua which means \\"Rapid Water\\" or \\"Rushing Water.\\" The name, spelled \\"Entiat\\", was selected for the river in 1958 by the Chelan County Public Utility District. The Entiat River is located entirely within Chelan County, in Washington state in the United States. Over 90% of the drainage basin of the Entiat River and its tributaries is publicly owned property, mostly the Wenatchee National Forest. A large number of place names in the Entiat River basin were given by Albert H. Sylvester. Course The Entiat River's headwaters lie in the Glacier Peak Wilderness of the Wenatchee National Forest. Its main source comes from the slopes of Mount Maude and Seven Fingered Jack, and Entiat Glacier. From there the river flows east through Entiat Meadows before turning south. It flows south and southeast between the Entiat Mountains on the west and the Chelan Mountains on the east. Downstream from the main river's confluence with the North Fork Entiat River, the Entiat River falls over Entiat Falls. It collects the waters of many small tributary creeks, including the Mad River. In its final miles, the Entiat River turns east to join the Columbia River at Columbia river mile 483.7, just south of the small city of Entiat. At this point the Columbia River is a reservoir created by Rocky Reach Dam. The reservoir's name is Lake Entiat. Fern Lake is located at the headwaters of the North Fork Entiat. Entiat Glacier, located in a cirque on the eastern side of Mount Maude and Seven Fingered Jack, is the headwaters of the Entiat River. Flora and fauna The Entiat River supports populations of Chinook salmon, steelhead trout, bull trout and Lamprey. The populations are relatively small due to the scarcity of juvenile-rearing habitat in the lower Entiat River, However due to the Entiat National Fish Hatchery (USFWS) there is a robust Summer Chinook fishery.

Moderation and organization The community forums, known as Conferences are supervised by conference hosts who guide conversations and may enforce conference rules on civility and/or appropriateness. All hosts are selected by TMN moderators. Overall support and supervision of the conferencing services is by core unpaid members, often referred to collectively, as conference organizers. Conference organizers have more system operational powers than conference hosts, along with the additional social authority of selecting featured conference hosts and (rarely) closing accounts for abuse. TMN requires registration and use of one's real name. TMN can only be accessed by registered users. TMN members use a consistent login name when posting messages, and a non-fixed pseudonym field alongside it. The pseudonym defaults to the user's real name, but can be changed at will but this is neither common nor is it encouraged. Although TMN is name based, the user's real name can be easily looked up using their login name. TMN members are not anonymous. TMN is divided into general subject areas known as conferences, which reflect member interests. Within conferences, members open separate conversational threads called topics for specific items of interest. \\"Public\\" conferences are open to all members, while \\"private\\" conferences are restricted to a list of users controlled by the conference hosts. Some private conferences (such as \\"Spirit\\" for women and \\"Fire\\" for men) are listed in TMN's directory, but are access restricted for privacy or membership-restriction reasons.

Her mother, similar to Nancy Drew's, had died some years before, so she was raised by the Parker housekeeper, Mrs. Weems. On her cases she is sometimes aided by her close friend, brunette Louise Sidell, and occasionally Jerry Livingston or Salt Sommers who were, respectively, a reporter and photographer for her father's paper. Benson's Reaction and Similarities to her life Benson, who was a newspaper reporter herself, favored Penny Parker over all the other books she wrote, including Nancy Drew. Her obituary quoted her as saying, \\" 'I always thought Penny Parker was a better Nancy Drew than Nancy is,' Mrs. Benson said in 1993.\\".

Revivals The first four books were lightly revised and reprinted in 1958; the project went no further, and Benson decided not to do Nancy-Drew-like updates on her own series (the first revised titles came out the next year). In 1980, when the court case between the Stratemeyer Syndicate and Grossest & Dunlap, a Penny Parker revival was in the process, but the plans never came into fruition. In 2010 to 2011, Halcyon Press reprinted the complete 17 book series in Kindle format as The Penny Parker Mystery Series volumes I and II. In 2012, Wildside Press reprinted numbers 3-17 of the series in the Penny Parker Megapack. Individual titles are also available in Kindle format. Characters Penny Parker- a high-school student with a skill at reporting and getting involved in mystery. Her impulsiveness can get her into hot water. She is the daughter of Anthony Parker and was first introduced in Tale of the Witch Doll and appeared in all seventeen books. Anthony Parker- Penny's widowed father and the owner of The Riverview Star. He gives her much freedom but rather disapproves of her sleuthing. First introduced in Tale of the Witch Doll, he appeared in every book. Mrs. Maude Weems- the Parker family housekeeper; since the death of Mrs. Parker, she has cared for Penny as her own. Like Penny's father, she disapproves of the girl's sleuthing. Mrs. Weems made her first appearance in Tale of the Witch Doll and showed up in fifteen other books. Louise Sidell- Penny's \\"closest friend\\", Louise is more cautious and less athletic than her chum. Though often reluctant to join Penny, she almost always gives in. She enjoys teasing Penny about Jerry Livingston. Louise debuted in Tale of the Witch Doll and made appearances in sixteen books overall, (all but Guilt of the Brass Thieves). Jerry Livingston- a \\"crack reporter\\" on The Riverview Star, Jerry serves as a love interest for Penny. Showing up in fourteen books, Jerry's first appearance was a brief one in Tale of the Witch Doll. Salt Sommers- a photographer on The Riverview Star and part-time airplane spotter, he is a good friend of Penny's. Salt appeared in eleven books, debuting in Danger at the Drawbridge. Mr. DeWitt (sometimes spelled Dewitt) - the Star's gruff but competent city editor. He was first introduced in Tale of the Witch Doll and appeared in thirteen books overall. Character Notes * Penny and her father were the only members of the main cast to appear in every book. Salt missed six, Mr. DeWitt missed four, Jerry missed three, and Louise and Mrs. Weems each missed one. * Salt was the only main cast member not introduced in the first book, Tale of the Witch Doll. He didn't appear until the third installment of the series, Danger at the Drawbridge. * Penny has blonde hair and blue eyes in most of the stories and is considered slim and athletic. However, she is said to have “auburn” hair in “Saboteurs on the River.” She is revealed to be fifteen years-old in “Voice from the Cave.” * Louise is a brunette, and described as plump. Like Penny, her age is never revealed. * In Danger at the Drawbridge, Salt is described as having a deep scar on his left cheek. * In Saboteurs on the River, Louise said she was going to be a nurse. * Louise has a younger brother, Ted, who is only mentioned in the first book. * Jerry was absent for two books (Hoofbeats on the Turnpike and Signal in the Dark) on military leave. Though it is not explicitly stated, it is presumed that he is also on leave during The Guilt of the Brass Thieves, considering the succession of the books.

Early life right right right right Austen Ballard Crehore was born in Hackensack, New Jersey January 9, 1893, the son of the innovative civil engineer William Williams Crehore, who was responsible for many major engineering innovations in bridge and skyscraper design and construction. (The senior Crehor helped designed 150 Nassau Street in New York City, often called the first true skyscraper.) Crehore's mother was Anna (Ballard) Crehore. Crehore attended Hackensack Public Schools until March 1, 1917. He tried to enter the US Army Air Service and then the US Naval Aviation. His application was repeatedly rejected by the American Examining Board because of a hearing problem. Crehore refused to take “no” for an answer and shortly after sailed directly for France to join the larger and at the time more established French Air Corps (Armée de l'Air). Military career On July 16, 1917, Crehore enlisted in France’s Service Aéronautique Militaire (Armée de l'Air), or Lafayette Flying Corps. He attended French aviation schools from July 21 to July 28, 1917 at Avord, Tours, Pau, and G.D.E. He received his brevet on the Caudron France, September 30, 1917. Crehore was known for bulldog-like tenacity. Even while suffering with appendicitis he continued to fly until he got his first victory over the enemy, bringing down a German aircraft. Only then did he permit himself any rest or to go to the hospital to have his appendix removed. Starting December 1, 1917 until the November 1918 armistice, Crehore, badge #8983, served at the front with the Escadrille SPAD 94. They were known as \\"The Grim Reaper\\", painting its likeness prominently on the entire side of each of the Squadron 94's planes. Crehore earned verified credit with the downing of two enemy aircraft and was awarded France’s Croix de guerre with two palms for his fine record serving the French Flying Corps during the war. He was later awarded France’s Legion d’Honneur. Serbian volunteer Lt. Petar (Pierre) Marinovich was Crehore's frequent flying partner and best friend. Marinovich had 22 confirmed shoot downs and credited Crehore with saving his life early in his career as a German plane was on Marinovich's tail, machine gunning it to shreds. Crehore rolled in behind the German and took it out for one of his first confirmed victories over the enemy. Marinovich died in a plane crash in 1919 performing for the king and queen of Belgium after the war. Later life On August 26, 1919, after his return from France, Crehore entered the New York to Toronto First International Air Race, promoted by one of New York City's major daily newspapers. He departed Mineola, New York (on Long Island) in an Ansaldo S.V.A. (Ansaldo A.300) and was by far the leader of the first leg of the air race. As he approached the first fuel stop in upstate New York the hordes of onlookers and admirers, not understanding about airplanes, ran out on the airfield as he approached the landing strip to greet the leader. Crehore had no choice but to pull up out of his landing procedure to save the lives of the onlookers, and crashed into a group of trees. The accident nearly killed him and very few of the people present understood that they caused the crash until they read the papers the next day. Crehore spent more than three months recovering from numerous broken bones. After he was released from the hospital in Albany, he announced that he would retire from flying and concentrate on building the Crehore and Richardson Agency, an insurance and brokerage firm in New York. On January 14, 1924 he married Katherine Dennis in New York City. They had three children, Katherine June Crehore (now June Crehore Gulick), Austen Crehore Jr (died within a few days of birth) and Thomas Oliver Crehore (a playwright). Crehore continued to develop his company successfully through the Great Depression without difficulty. Years later he sold the Crehore and Richardson Agency to Eifert, French and Company of New York, where he served as President until his retirement in 1960. After that he served as president of the Lafayette Flying Corps Association, and was the director of the American Society of French Legion of Honor. A resident of Warren Township, New Jersey, Crehore died surrounded by his family in Scotch Plains on August 20, 1962, at age 69.\\"A.B. CREHORE DIES; INSURANCE MAN; Official of Firm Here Led Lafayette Escadrille Unit\\", The New York Times, August 22, 1962.

His uniform is now part of the permanent collection at the Westfield Historical Society in New Jersey, and his numerous metals and awards are kept at the International Aviation Museum in Colorado. The Crehore family was a family of very early aviators. Three of his brothers were highly accomplished pilots, and two of his brothers served the US Army Air Service in World War I at the same time as he was serving in the French Air Corps. All the Crehore brothers survived the war.

Personal life José Arsenio Vicente del Carmen was born on 19 July 1806 in Santiago de Veraguas, then part of the Viceroyalty of the New Granada, to Domingo Blas de Obaldía y Latatu, a Spaniard native of Álava, and Juana María de Orejuela Cordero, a Criollo of Spanish descent. In 1842 he married Ana María Gallegos Candanedo with whom he had four children: José Arístides, José Domingo, José Lorenzo, and Ana Josefa, the last two dying before reaching puberty. Vice Presidency (1851—1855) Obaldía was elected in 1851 to succeed Rufino Cuervo y Barreto as the 7th Vice President of New Granada; he took office on 1 April 1851 as President José Hilario López Valdéz's 2nd Vice President. From 14 October 1851 to 21 January 1852 Vice President Obaldía became Acting President in charge of the Executive Power while President López was out of the capital until his return. On 1 April 1853 José María Obando del Campo succeeded López to the Presidency, Obaldía remained as Vice President as the elections for President and Vice President were held two years apart. Although Obando and Obaldía both belonged to the newly created Liberal party, they belonged to different ideological camps, Obando was of the Draconian faction (pragmatist but defenders of the death penalty), and Obaldía was of the Golgothian faction (radical liberal reformers) this brought them into conflict from the start as the Golgothians had opposed Obando's nomination in the first place. In April 1854, Golgothians in congress moved to reduce the size and influence of the armed forces, thus provoking a coup by General José María Melo y Ortiz, commander of the Bogotá garrison. General Melo hoped that Obando would welcome the uprise and move to suspend Congress, but when President Obando refused, Melo assumed the presidency himself establishing a dictatorship and imprisoning Obando. Vice President Obaldía managed to escape by taking refuge in the US Legation in Bogotá headed by James S. Green, the United States Chargé d'Affaire to New Granada. Obaldía and the rest of the Melo opposition reconvened in Ibagué where they headed the government-in-exile and the military campaign to take Melo from power. On 22 September, Congress convened in Ibagué impeached President Obando for irresponsible negligence in not preventing the coup and formally removed from office. On 5 August Vice President Obaldía, who had testified against Obando in his trial before Congress, was left in charge of the Executive Power as Acting President of the Government acting in rebellion against the Dictatorship of Melo. On 4 December the constitutional forces marched into Bogotá, deposed Melo and left Vice President Obaldía as Acting President of the constitutional government now in power. On 1 April 1855 Obaldía's term came to an end and Congress elected Conservative Congressman Manuel María Mallarino Ibargüen to succeed Obaldía as Vice President and to finish Obando's term as Acting President.

The National Office is in Toronto. The chief aim of the College is to promote a high standard of organ playing, choral directing, church music and composition. To this end, it holds examinations and grants diplomas, encourages musical events such as workshops and recitals, commissions new works, affords opportunities for discussion, and provides advice on being a professional musician. The College holds an annual summer convention. Recent conventions were held in Kingston ON (2016) and Montreal QC (2017). Upcoming conventions will occur in Calgary AB (2018) and Halifax NS (2019). The College is registered as a charitable organization in Canada. History On 27 October 1909, a resolution recognising \\"the importance of establishing a college of organists, similar to that of England, in Canada\\" was passed at the Conservatory of Music in Brantford, Ontario and in December of that year, the Canadian Guild of Organists was founded. In 1920 the Guild was renamed as the Canadian College of Organists, and in 1959 it was granted the prefix Royal, in recognition of the fiftieth anniversary of the College. Publications From October 1968 to June 2009, The American Organist, published monthly by the American Guild of Organists (AGO), was the official journal of the RCCO as well as of the AGO. In September 2009, because of changes in United States Postal Service regulations, the RCCO began to publish its own official journal. Its quarterly newsletter Organ Canada/Orgue Canada was redesigned as a glossy bimonthly publication, with the purpose of \\"celebrating excellence in Canadian organ building, performance, composition, and education\\".Cross, Bruce. \\"RCCO Publications: A Brief History\\", The American Organist, June 2009, vol. 43 (no. 6), p. 11. The American Organist, while no longer the official journal of the RCCO, remains available to members by subscription, along with a selection of other choral and organ publications, at group rates. Since 2000 the RCCO has also published a range of choral and organ music by Canadian composers.  Diplomas  The College grants several levels of accreditation, for which it holds examinations annually: * Colleague Diploma (CRCCO) * Associate Diploma (ARCCO) * Fellow Diploma (FRCCO) * Professional Diploma in Choral Conducting (Ch.RCCO) * Service Playing certificate * Worship Accompanist certificate * Choir Training certificate The College offers printed materials and recordings on topics including organ study, choir training, preparation for examinations, commissioning of compositions, purchase of organs, employment and ethics. It holds composition competitions and organ playing competitions, and awards prizes and scholarships.

Biography Zana Nimani was born in 1961 in Belgrade, to Albanian parents from the town of Đakovica. Nimani started her career in 1976, when she started to sing with the band Suton, in which her (at the time) boyfriend Radovan Jovićević played guitar. Since 1979, the band started to perform under the name Zana. The band's debut album, Loše vesti uz rege za pivsku flašu (\\"Bad News Accompanied by Reggae for a Beer Bottle\\"), released in 1981, brought them nationwide popularity. The following two albums, Dodirni mi kolena (\\"Touch My Knees\\"), released in 1982,Dodirni mi kolena, discogs. Retrieved 8 December 2016. and Natrag na voz (\\"Back to the Train\\"), released in 1983,Natrag na voz at Discogs were also well received. However, when Zana went on a hiatus in 1984, Nimani decided to leave the band (which would continue to work under the name Zana). In 1986, she released her only solo album, Noćas pevam samo tebi (\\"Tonight I Sing Only for You\\"). The album was recorded in Sweden and featured Swedish studio musicians. It was produced by Tini Varga, who also authored part of the songs. Other authors on the album were Nimani herself and former Zana members Marina Tucaković, Aleksandar Radulović \\"Futa\\" and Bogdan Dragović. The album brought such minor hits as Što ne znam gde si sad (\\"Why Don't I Know Where You Are Now\\") and Miško zna (\\"Miško Knows\\").

It is listed on the National Register of Historic PlacesNational Register of Historical Places - MASSACHUSETTS (MA), Berkshire County and until July 2012 was owned and operated as a hotel by descendants of the original owners. Elm Court was built as the Berkshire summer home of William Douglas Sloane and Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, a member of the wealthy American Vanderbilt family. Designed by premier architectural firm Peabody and Stearns, with gardens and landscape design by Frederick Law Olmsted, Elm Court is the largest Shingle style house in the United States, with 106 rooms. Commercial use, decline and restoration Owners Colonel Helm George Wildehgwilde and his wife Marjorie Field Wilde [great-great-granddaughter of William H. Vanderbilt] opened Elm Court in 1948 as an Inn ('Elm Court Club, Inc.) with an accommodation for up to 60 people. Dancing and dinner open to the public Saturday nights made for a popular spot for many years. Knott Hotels Corporation were retained as the operators of the Inn. The Wildes - who also owned the neighboring High Lawn manor (designed by Delano and Aldrich) and farm \\\\- pursued the Inn concept in order to preserve the estate and provide summer employment for the area's many teachers. The Inn eventually faltered and due to overwhelming operational costs the house shuttered in 1957. While some fine furnishings were removed the house was largely left merely locked up but intact as it had been in the 1950s. Unoccupied, secluded, and only lightly patrolled it fell prey over the years to massive vandalism, outright looting, some arson, and a general derelict state by the end of the 20th century. The massive elm tree on the grounds for which the property was named died in the early 1960s of disease. Upon the death of George Wilde in 1998 the Elm Court passed to his daughter Lila Wilde Berle of Stockbridge. Lila's husband, Peter A. A. Berle (1937–2007), was a highly respected environmentalist, New York State assemblyman, commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation and president of the National Audubon Society She in turn sold the estate in 1999 to her son, Robert Berle, great-great-grandson of the Sloanes, and his wife, Sonya, for just under $1 million. They undertook a major restoration effort, repairing original details and adding new wiring, plumbing, heating, and opened the property as a luxury Inn while portions of the home remained a work in progress with restoration. In August 2005 the estate - with the manor house, greenhouse, carriage house and cottage - was placed on the market for sale for an asking price of $21,500,000 on . By comparison the highest price for any Berkshire County property sold was recorded January, 2007 for Southmayd Farm for $6.9 millionStockbridge estate fetches $3.2M - Berkshire Eagle Online The property was reduced to an asking price of $17.5 million in July 2006 and a contract was signed for sale to a Florida-based hotel business ('The Kessler Collection') however that deal fell through and was mutually terminated by both parties.Home - Berkshire Eagle Online Last listed at $14 million, it was taken off the market at the end of 2006. As of August 2009 the property was taken off the market. In the Spring of 2010 the Town of Stockbridge approved a permit for an 18-room hotel in the mansion. The Town of Lenox approved a sign permit for the property in the summer of 2010. These permits are in addition to the restaurant permit for the original horse Stable, already in place. (Town of Stockbridge, MA; Board of Selectmen Special Permit Hearing January 6, 2003). New roofs have been installed on the Butler's Cottage, the Gardner's Cottage, Stable and other support buildings at the estate. A new septic system for the entire property has been installed. The frontage of the property has been cleared of brush and invasive plant species. The Mansion and other buildings can now be viewed from Old Stockbridge Road, as well as the lake in the distance. Commercial sale in 2012; ending the last of the Berkshire cottages held by family In July 2012 it was announced that the property in its entirety (55,000-square foot mansion on 44 acres) was sold to a Colorado-based group for $9.8 million. That is believed to be the highest price paid for a residential property in Berkshire County history. Elm Court Realty LLC, which includes the property's longtime owners, Robert and Sonya Berle, sold Elm Court to Front Yard LLC of Denver, according to documents on file at the Middle Berkshire Registry of Deeds. The Berles have retained a small percentage of ownership in the property. Elm Court had been the last of the Berkshire cottages to have remained in the family of its original owners. Robert Berle is a descendant of William Douglas Sloane and Emily Vanderbilt. A $50 million renovation of the property is due to take place in 2020.

It was constructed in 1931 at a cost of $6.5 million and designed by the firm of Irwin S. Chanin. The Century is designed in the Art Deco style, unlike many of its neighbors, which are designed in the Beaux-Arts style. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places, as a contributing property to the Central Park West Historic District, in 1982. The building, also part of a local historic district designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, is one of the three tallest structures within the boundaries of the district. A tenant-landlord dispute at the Century was ongoing for most of the 1980s. By 2010, units in the building were being sold for millions of dollars. History The Century apartment building is located on the site of the Century Theatre at 25 Central Park West.Brockmann, Jorg et al. (2002). Architect Irwin S. Chanin's office executed a US$1.25 million bond to guarantee the construction of a 29-floor apartment building at the theater site on October 25, 1930. The Century Theatre was initially backed by many wealthy New Yorkers but it quickly became unprofitable. The theater was still being demolished in late October 1930 when Chanin's firm secured a $6.5 million loan from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for the construction of the Century. As the moves to begin the Century project were occurring, Chanin's The Majestic was already under construction nearby, in the 100 block of Central Park West. Theater demolition pushed forward through early November. In the November 9, 1930 edition of the New York Times Irwin Chanin remarked regarding construction of The Majestic and the Century. He noted that, together, the two projects would employ a daily average of 3,000 men with rates of pay identical \\"those in vogue during the boom days of 1927 when we were erecting the Chanin Building.\\" In January 1931, with demolition at the theater site winding down, a time capsule was pulled from the cornerstone of the Century Theatre. Among its contents was a congratulatory letter from U.S. President at the time of the theater's construction, Theodore Roosevelt. The construction was handled by another Chanin company, Chanin Construction Company. Construction would require over of electrical wiring, three times what was required for the 56-story Chanin Building. By October 1930 it was predicted that the building would be complete by October 31, 1931. Construction began in April 1931, and by the end of the next month, the steel structure for the Century was complete up to its 15th floor. Within thirty days the entire steel structure was complete. The rapid progress was made possible by, according to Irwin Chanin \\"coordination and overlapping of various trades employed.\\" A June 1931 newspaper article reported that the average number of workers since the beginning of construction was 1,050, with up to 1,400 employed at one time. Original predictions, by Chanin, estimated 1,500 men would be employed, on average per day, for a period of one year during construction. By September 1931 work on the Century was nearing completion and apartments were already being offered for rent.  1980s controversy  The building was purchased in 1982 by an investment group, which proposed 13 months later to create a cooperative corporation for the Century. The proposal offered to sell the building, purchased for $36 million, to the tenants for $110 million. That proposal was quickly nixed by the New York State Attorney General's office but it engendered a long running \\"kill or be killed relationship\\" between the building's tenants and its owners. In 1983 tenants accused owners of neglecting to maintain the property and sought court action against the owners. Lawyers representing about 200 tenants described the building as a slum \\"with crumbling walls both inside and out, vermin infestation, extensive leaks, and virtually everything else that can go wrong with a structure.\\" The move was one in a tenant-owner dispute that would last until 1989 when an agreement was finally reached. The New York Times called the dispute, \\"one of the longest, bitterest conversion fights in Manhattan apartment house history.\\" It ended with a compromise that allowed tenants in 229 of the 410 apartments to purchase their apartments at prices which were estimated to be one half or one third the market rate. By February 1989 several of the apartments new owners had sold their individual properties at profits exceeding $1 million. The investment group that purchased the building in 1982, Century Apartment Associates, saw their investment rise in value from $36 million to around $140 million.  21st century  In the 21st century, as it has been historically, the Century is largely an upscale apartment house. In May 2010 six bedroom apartments in the Century sold for around $19 million with one bedrooms selling for between $875,000 and $1.675 million. Architecture The Century, along with its one-year-older sister building, The Majestic, was among the first residential buildings to use what had been predominantly an office building style of architecture. Both the Century and The Majestic stand 30-stories and their Art Deco motifs stand in contrast to the Beaux-Arts buildings that surround them.Lehman, Arnold. \\"New York Skyscrapers: The Jazz Modern Neo-American Beautilitarian Style,\\" The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 29, No. 8. (April 1971), pp. 363–370. Retrieved 3 April 2007. The building was designed by the Office of Irwin S. Chanin, with Architectural Director Jacques Delamarre at the head of the design team. It was then constructed in 1930 and/or 1931, sources vary slightly.Central Park West Historic District, National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form, New York's State and National Registers of Historic Places Document Imaging Project, New York State Historic Preservation Office. Retrieved 2 April 2007. The Century features art deco \\"machine-inspired\\" towers and cantilevered floor slabs. The floor slabs prevent the necessity of corner columns thus allowing the building to be fitted with large corner windows. The three ornate entrances face Central Park West, 62nd, and 63rd Streets. During the 1980s the building held 410 apartments, ranging in size from one to eight bedrooms; 52 of the apartments had large terraces. The main lobby, on the ground floor, houses professional offices. Significance The building is a contributing property to the Central Park West Historic District, which was recognized by the U.S. National Register of Historic Places when its nomination was accepted on November 9, 1982. It is one of four \\"twin-towered\\" structures in the historic district, including The Eldorado, The San Remo, and The Majestic. Collectively these buildings contribute to the unique skyline of the Upper West Side along Central Park West. The Century was designated a local landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on July 10, 1985. The designation subjects improvements and changes to the property to various local regulations and rules administered by the Landmarks Commission. Upon its designation as a local landmark the Commission staff remarked that the Century was a \\"sophisticated essay in Art Deco design exhibiting a complex balance of horizontal and vertical elements.\\" At 30 floors it and two other structures hold the title of the tallest building in the federally designated Central Park West Historic District. The height of the buildings were shaped primarily by the Multiple Dwelling Act of 1929 which allowed apartment buildings no higher than 19 stories. The law provided an exclusion for taller buildings, such as the Century, if a building site was sufficiently large and the building itself occupied no more than 20% of the site.

The company offered quality measurement technology that estimated the experienced quality that would be measured by a mean opinion score (MOS) resulting from subjective tests using actual human test subjects. Digital video systems exploit properties of the human visual system to reduce the bit rate at which a video sequence is coded. Video quality assessment tools based on network quality metrics such as packet loss, MDI and PSNR do not correlate well with a perceived visual quality due to the nonlinear behavior of the human visual system. As a result, accurate prediction of the perceived quality of the output video should also take the human visual system properties into account. Genista Corporation’s patented technology was the result of research done by Stefan Winkler in the field of vision models and metrics.

Andy Razaf wrote the lyrics to a score by Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller and Harry Brooks for the Broadway musical comedy play Connie's Hot Chocolates. First performances The song was first performed at the premiere of Connie's Hot Chocolates in Harlem at Connie's Inn as an opening song by Paul Bass and Margaret Simms, and repeated later in the musical by Russell Wooding's Hallelujah Singers. Connie's Hot Chocolates was transferred to the Hudson Theatre on Broadway during June 1929, where it was renamed to Hot Chocolates and where Louis Armstrong became the orchestra director. The script also required Armstrong to play \\"Ain't Misbehavin\\" in a trumpet solo, and although this was initially slated only to be a reprise of the opening song, Armstrong's performance was so well received that the trumpeter was asked to climb out of the orchestra pit and play the piece on stage. As noted by Thomas Brothers in his book Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism, Armstrong was first taught \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\" by Waller himself, \\"woodshedding\\" it until he could \\"play all around it\\"; he cherished it \\"because it was 'one of those songs you could cut loose and swing with.'\\" Recordings During the first half of the 20th century, when a tune was successful in terms of sheet music sold, it was typically recorded by several different artists. All six \\"Ain't Misbehavin\\" recordings of 1929 were successes in the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) rankings for that year: * Leo Reisman and his orchestra (with vocals by Lew Conrad, #2). * Louis Armstrong (#7). * Bill Robinson (with Irving Mills & his Hotsy Totsy Gang, #8). * Gene Austin (with Leonard Joy & his orchestra, #9). * Ruth Etting (#16). * Fats Waller (instrumental version, #17). Waller re- recorded the song with vocals for the 1943 movie Stormy Weather. Waller's recording received the Grammy Hall of Fame Award during 1984, during 2001, it was one of 365 Songs of the Century selected by the RIAA, and it was one of fifty recordings selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress during 2004. Ain't Misbehavin has been recorded by many other performers over the years, including Anita O'Day, Sarah Vaughan (for \\"Sarah Vaughan in Hi-Fi\\"; 1950), Bing Crosby (for \\"Songs I Wish I Had Sung the First Time Around\\"), Billie Holiday, Eartha Kitt, Ella Fitzgerald, Carol Channing, Django Reinhardt, Harry James, Miles Davis, Kay Starr, Frankie Laine, Art Tatum, Floyd Pepper, Sonny Stitt, Sam Cooke, Johnnie Ray, Sidney Bechet, Ray Charles, Nat King Cole, Elkie Brooks, Eyran Katsenelenbogen, Willie Nelson, Kermit Ruffins, Leon Redbone, Freddie White, Dave Brubeck, Johnny Hartman, Robson Green and Jerome Flynn (Mini tv series UK, 1997), and Bill Haley & His Comets (who recorded a rock and roll version during 1957). Johnnie Ray's version scored number 17 in the UK Singles Chart during May 1956. In 1960, Tommy Bruce and the Bruisers had a number 3 hit in the UK Singles Chart with their cover version of the song. During 1976, Leon Redbone performed the song on Saturday Night Live. It served as the title song of the successful 1978 musical Ain't Misbehavin'. Country music artist Hank Williams Jr. recorded a version for his 1985 studio album Five-O. Released as a single, the song peaked at #1 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart and earned Williams a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.

This is the residence, where all who have not succeeded to get Rajaship remain under the management of the eldest resident male or female member of that particular branch of the family. In North Malabar region, this is pronounced as Kolom ().Agrarian relations in late medieval malabar by M.T Narayanan (2003) Swatantra Bharath Press A chief princely lineage of Kerala consists of several Kovilakams representing different matrilineal branches of the same family from which the individual members could ascend to the status of Raja in accordance to their seniority in age within the lineage. The Kovilakam-residences are usually large beautiful manors or palaces with extensive wood work and mural paintings in the traditional medieval Kerala architecture style. A Kovilakam was usually endowed with estates and properties (crown lands) sufficient to the maintenance of its constituent members. At the very moment when a member ascends to any dignity/station (stanam), he/she loses his residence in the Kovilakam and is usually brought up and lived apart on the property set apart for his dignity/station (stanam). However there are instances when such members on ascending to a station have preferred to stay back in their Kovilakams of birth. It was not uncommon where in due to internal squabbles and manoeuvres within different Kovilakams of a ruling princely family, a certain Kovilakam(s) may usurp and centralize the sole right to inherit the Rajaship and deprive the other Kovilakams within the princely lineage of its inheritance to the station of Raja.A collection of treaties, engagements, and other papers of importance by William LoganThe book of Duarte Barbosa: an account of the countries bordering on the Indian Ocean and their inhabitants by Duarte Barbosa Examples The Kottayam Royal Princely State lineage of North Malabar had three branches; viz.: * Kizhakke Kovilakam (Eastern Palace) * Thekke Kovilakam (Southern Palace) * Patinjare Kovilakam (Western Palace) References Category:Culture of Kerala ","title":"Kovilakam"},{"id":"10451611","text":"Irene Loughlin was born on May 20, 1967 in Hamilton, Canada. Loughlin is known for her performance artwork, writings, and cultural work.  Biography  Her art embodies real life images of feminism, health activism, to even anti- poverty movements. As Loughlin has practiced her art over the last 15 years, the artworks created have focused more on images to challenge many social constructs such as mental illnesses, visual metaphors of medicine, and ecological landscapes in order to comment on contemporary emotive discourses. The works of art created all stem from images drawn from Loughlin's experiences or witnessed throughout her life such as areas regarding childhood, spiritualism, labour, exercise, depression, diagnosis, sexual abuse, processed foods, rehabilitation, happiness and nourishment, hope, class distinction, sexuality, desire, speech, addiction, therapy, silence, and historical re-enactments. Loughlin further developed her practice as an artist in Vancouver near the historic Downtown Eastside neighborhood. There she has contributed to the activist and disability community through gallery Gachet, VANDU, and the Carnegie Centre. Loughlin has had the opportunity to display and talk about her artwork in multiple national and international contexts.

He graduated from Princeton University in 1924 and received a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from Columbia Law School in 1932. He founded Chicago & Southern Airlines in 1933 which, in 1953, merged with Delta Air Lines. Putnam later served as chief executive officer of Delta Air Lines and held a seat on its board of directors until his death.  Life and career  Putnam was born to a prominent family from New England, his mother Louise Carleton Putnam, was the daughter of New York publishing magnate George W. Carleton. Paternally, he was a lineal descendant of American Revolutionary War general Israel Putnam. He was also related to the physical anthropologist Carleton Coon, with whom he corresponded closely regarding theories of anatomical and biological differences between human races. He was raised as part of the American Episcopal Church and remained a lifelong member. His best known book is entitled Race and Reason (1961), an advocacy of racial segregation that originated in a letter he wrote to President Dwight Eisenhower protesting the end of segregation in U.S. public schools. According to Putnam, the immediate impetus for his letter to Eisenhower was the concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter in Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958), which Putnam refers to as \\"the recent Little Rock case\\". Elsewhere in the book Putnam critiques Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), calling for its reversal. Psychologist Henry Garrett wrote the introduction. In this book, Putnam wrote: > In the next 500,000,000,000 years I would be quite prepared to concede the > possibility the Negro may, through normal processes of mutation and natural > selection within his own race, eventually overtake and even surpass the > white race. [...] When the Negro has bred out his limitations over hundreds, > or thousands, of years, it will be time enough to consider absorbing him in > any such massive doses as would be involved in the South today. > The mulatto who was bent on making the nation mulatto was the real danger. > His alliance with the white equalitarian often combined men who had nothing > in common save a belief that they had a grudge against society. They > regarded every Southerner who sensed the genetic truth as a bigot [...]. > Here were the men who needed to be reminded of the debt the Negro owed to > white civilization. Putnam also wrote a biographical book on Theodore Roosevelt's youth that was praised by Edmund Morris, the author of the best known biography of that president. Putnam admired Roosevelt's belief that \\"Teutonic (and) English blood is the source of American greatness\\". Carleton Putnam died of pneumonia on Mar. 5, 1998. He was survived by his wife, Esther Mackenzie Willcox Auchincloss, a daughter, three grandchildren, a stepdaughter, and three step- grandchildren. He was previously married to Lucy Chapman Putnam.

Plot Taking place in 2012, the player assumes the role of a futuristic grave robber/archaeologist called a \\"raptor\\", who has come to explore a recently opened cavern in Scotland rumoured to contain the Holy Grail. Development Ken Haywood produced the original concept for the game and worked with Intelligent Games's own Richard Guy on the final design. The original design called for a Myst-style pre-rendered environment. As development progressed, the team switched to real-time 3D. The game features music written by Ray Shulman and Kerry Minnear, both former members of Gentle Giant. Reception Both GameSpot and Next Generation commented that the control interface is highly counterintuitive, especially the inverted cursor movement, and cannot be changed. GameSpot reviewer Tal Blevins opined that the game is otherwise well-worth playing, citing the atmospheric music, entertaining story, and good integration of the puzzles into the plot. He was particularly pleased with the graphic design, remarking that \\"the game is steeped in shadow that hides a subtle richness; it may take several game sessions for you to truly appreciate the brilliant artistic design included.\\" The Next Generation reviewer agreed that the story is gripping but was somewhat less impressed, summarizing, \\"Azrael's Tear brings adventure, high-resolution graphics, and a smattering of action to what is essentially a Myst clone, adding a little life - just a little - to a genre that sorely needs it.\\" Nicholas Petreley of InfoWorld wrote, \\"Azrael's Tear is not a crowd-pleaser, and I'm grateful for it. It is for those people who like to lose themselves in an entirely different world. If you're among that camp, prepare to enter the world of Azrael's Tear and rarely come up for air.\\" Andy Butcher reviewed Azrael's Tear for Arcane magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"If you take the time to get into it [...] Azrael's Tear is atmospheric and extremely satisfying.\\" In a 2002 retrospective review for Just Adventure, Michael Necasek commented, \\"The story of Azrael's Tear revolves around props far from unusual in adventure games: the Holy Grail, the Knights Templar, secret conspiracies to rule the world. These all are almost clichés. But like other good games (Gabriel Knight 3 comes to mind), Azrael's Tear manages to explain them with unexpected twists.\\" Azrael's Tear was not a commercial success.

The performance was recorded in December 2004 at the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in Chico, California. The album was released along with a separate DVD in 2005 by Rhino Records. This was the last album the band made with saxophonist Ron Stallings, who died in 2009. Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic says Live at 25 \\"is designed to be less a historical document than a nostalgic souvenir for longtime fans, capturing the group at a quarter-century mark.\\" He believes \\"the song selection is good, the band sounds tight and professional, the production is clean and punchy, and while it's never especially engaging, it is an enjoyable performance.\\"  Track listing  Track listings and personnel adapted from the album and DVD's liner notes.

It is a staple of the Maldivian cuisine, Sri Lankan cuisine, as well as the cuisine of the Southern Indian states and territories of Lakshadweep, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and in the past it was one of the main exports from Maldives to Sri Lanka, where it is known as masikaruvadu umbalakaḍa .Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom, Barcelona 1999, The abundant sea harvest of the Indian Ocean around the Atolls of the Maldives and, Lakshadweep in India yields many pelagic fishes, like skipjack, yellowfin tuna, little tunny (known locally as laṭṭi) and frigate mackerel. All these fishes have been traditionally processed on the Maldive Islands as a main source of food as well as income for Maldivians. Processing method On a good night, given a large shoal of bonito, the fishermen, using simple bamboo poles, catch about 600–1,000 fish in two to three hours, an average of one a minute. Every fish is gutted, skinned and cut following a traditional pattern. The gills and some of the innards are thrown away. The head and backbone are removed, and the belly piece is separated. Then the fish is divided into four longitudinal pieces called ari. These long pieces can be cut into smaller sections (foti) in case of large yellowfin tunas. Next these pieces of tuna are processed by means of boiling, smoking and sun-drying until they acquire a wood-like appearance. Being dried in this manner, the fish can be kept indefinitely without refrigeration. This was important in the past, when there was no other way to preserve and store the fish for Maldivians. Derived products Historically, Maldive fish used to be sold by the piece (ari) - a long fillet as hard as a block of wood. Defective pieces were pounded with a huge mortar and pestle (a standard piece of local kitchen equipment) until it was powdered into fine splinters. The resulting product was traditionally used in Maldivian cuisine to flavour local dishes such as mas huni. The process of making Maldive fish produces a by- product called Rihaakuru. This is made of the stock remnant after the boiling of fish. Maldive fish is widely used in Maldivian cuisine in dishes such as curries, mas huni, gulha and bōkiba. Use in Sri Lankan cuisine Many Sri Lankan dishes, especially vegetable curries, also include Maldive fish, which acts as a thickening, flavouring and protein component. It is also an essential ingredient in coconut sambol, which is a staple of Sri Lankan cuisine. In other dishes it is used in such small quantities that the flavor is undetectable, adding a certain character to the food. Maldive fish is the Sri Lankan answer to the shrimp pastes and fish sauces of South East Asia. This powdered tuna is packed nowadays in small plastic packets, already pounded or crushed. Maldive fish is used in a number of Sri Lankan dishes, sometimes retaining its strong flavor as the main ingredient, like in Sini Sambal, which keeps indefinitely stored in an airtight jar.

As military commander of New Orleans when the city unexpectedly fell to the Union Navy in 1862, Lovell was fiercely criticized by local citizens for failing to predict a naval invasion. The Confederate government also heaped blame on him, to deflect attention from their own error in leaving so few troops to defend the city. A Court of Enquiry later cleared him of charges of incompetence, but his reputation never recovered. Early life Lovell was born in the District of Columbia. His father was Joseph Lovell, the eighth Surgeon General of the United States Army. His great grandfather, James Lovell, was an active member of the Whig organization in Boston before the American Revolution, and was a member of the Continental Congress from 1777–1782. He was one of the prime movers in the scheme to supplant General George Washington as commander-in- chief by General Horatio Gates and an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. Lovell graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. artillery. He was severely wounded at Belén Gate during the Battle of Chapultepec in the Mexican–American War, receiving a brevet appointment to captain for his service in that battle. After serving on a variety of minor posts, he resigned from the army in 1854 to join the abortive Cuban expedition of General John A. Quitman. He then moved to New York City, where he engaged in business and served as deputy street commissioner.Eicher, p. 355. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, Lovell left New York City and enlisted in the Confederate army. He was appointed as a major general on October 7, 1861, to replace Maj. Gen. David Twiggs in command at New Orleans, who had asked to be relieved because of health issues. According to the historian John D. Winters, the New Orleans citizenry expressed great disappointment over the Lovell appointment, for they had preferred either P.G.T. Beauregard or Braxton Bragg. At the time Bragg was in command of Confederate forces in Pensacola, Florida. Outraged at being passed over for the command, Bragg wrote to Governor of Louisiana Thomas Overton Moore: \\"The command at New Orleans was rightly mine. I feel myself degraded by the action of the government and shall take care they know my sentiments.\\"John D. Winters, The Civil War in Louisiana, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1963, , p. 64 Two weeks later Bragg wrote Moore that he considered Lovell \\"very competent, and but for his insubordinate vanity would be a fine soldier Still we could do as well without him and he can't make me believe he was not bought.\\"Winters, p. 64 By the time Lovell was posted to New Orleans, Abraham Lincoln had approved plans for a Union Navy attempt to capture New Orleans by entering the Mississippi River at its mouth and sailing northward 80 miles to the city. Neither Lovell, or the city's officials or the Navy Department in Richmond thought this was a credible option and concentrated on plans to repel Union land forces from approaching the city from the Upper Mississippi area. Forts Jackson and St. Philip, the two Confederate forts at the mouth of the river, were believed sufficient to discourage an up-river assault in the unlikely event such a tactic was planned. From the beginning of the war, believing the city safe, much of its fighting forces were sent to other Southern battlefields, depleting the city of all but a small number of its Confederate Army defenders. When fishermen brought news of the landing of the Union ships off the Louisiana coast in February 1862, the inability of the Confederates to hold the city if the forts failed became obvious. When the forts could not be captured after several days' bombardment, Farragut's fleet slipped past them under cover of darkness and within four days appeared at the city's docks. While these ships were en route, the decision was made to evacuate the land defenses from New Orleans for use in fighting in the Louisiana interior and other parts of the Confederacy. It is believed Lovell's preparations to protect the city from a land invasion were sound, but Farragut's threat to bombard the vulnerable city with his formidable gunships once the fleet landed brought an end to Confederate New Orleans. Lovell's uniform, Louisiana State Museum, The Cabildo Lovell grave marker, Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx General Lovell was roundly criticized for his failure to prevent the fall of the city even though he did not have sufficient men or materiel to repulse the Union forces. He then commanded an infantry division under Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn at the Second Battle of Corinth in Mississippi. He was later relieved of command as a consequence of his poor performance at New Orleans. Stung by this reprimand, he demanded a court of inquiry, which met in April 1863 and declared him innocent of charges of incompetence. However, he was not given any assignments for the rest of the war.Bergeron, pp. 101–02. In his book about Confederate New Orleans, The Night the War Was Lost, author/historian Charles L. Dufour blames Jefferson Davis and in particular Naval Secretary Mallory for deciding that the land war in Virginia took greater precedence over giving more attention to the valuable port city of New Orleans. Its unanticipated fall into Union hands sent shockwaves not only through the Confederacy but Europe as well, where, next to New York City, it was the best-known of American cities. According to Dufour, the Davis government deflected blame onto Lovell for the loss of New Orleans in an effort to avoid being blamed by the Southern public. Lovell's valiant efforts to clear his name never really accomplished their goal. His honor and career were seen by Dufour as having been sadly sacrificed to the political power and reality of war. Postbellum life Lovell farmed a rice plantation near Savannah, Georgia, immediately after the war, but a tidal wave destroyed his first crop, forcing him to return with his family to New York City. He resumed his career as a civil engineer and surveyor. Lovell worked under the supervision of former Union general John Newton on a project to clear obstructions from the East River at Hell Gate. He died in New York City and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

Lawrence Ferlinghetti described him as \\"one of the greats of post-World-War-Two San Francisco poets and musicians\\".quoted in the back-cover blurb in the Penguin Selected Poems from 2005, David's Copy Meltzer came to prominence with inclusion of his work in the anthology, The New American Poetry 1945–1960. Biography=Early life Meltzer was born in Rochester, New York, the son of a cellist and a harpist. In 1940, the family moved to Brooklyn. At the age of 11, he wrote his first poem, on the topic of the New York City subway system. He performed on radio and TV in The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour. The family moved once again to Rockville Centre. His parents separated, and he accompanied his father to Los Angeles in 1954. In 1957, he moved to San Francisco and became part of a circle of writers based around Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan. In 1958, he recorded an album of his poems with a jazz combo featuring pianist Bob Dorough for Jim Dickson on Dickson's Vaja label. The album was not released but finally saw the light of day in 2006 on Sierra Records titled \\"David Meltzer: Poet w/ Jazz 1958.\\" Jim Dickson had earlier recorded Lord Buckley, Lenny Bruce and the Page Cavanaugh Trio. Later Jim would be A&R; producer for World Pacific and Elektra Records as well as discovering and producing the rock group, The Byrds. In 1968, Meltzer signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post Work One of the key poets of the Beat generation, Meltzer was also a jazz guitarist, Kabbalist scholar, and the author of more than 50 books of poetry and prose. 2005 saw the publication of David's Copy: The Selected Poems of David Meltzer (edited by Michael Rothenberg and with an introduction by Jerome Rothenberg), which provides a current overview of Meltzer's work. Meltzer's Beat Thing (La Alameda Press) is his epic poem on the Beat generation. Jack Hirschman said of it: Meltzer's other books include, No Eyes, poems on Lester Young, and a book of interviews, San Francisco Beat: Talking with the Poets (City Lights Books). Meltzer taught at the New College of California in the Poetics Program, which was founded by Duncan McNaughton. With his singer-musician wife Tina Meltzer, David recorded as a duo and then with their group, The Serpent Power. With his second wife, poet Julie Rogers, Meltzer frequently performed at poetry venues. The two produced a CD, \\"Two-Tone,\\" in collaboration with tenor saxophonist, Zan Stewart. released on Pureland Audio in 2016  Death  He spent most of his life in the San Francisco Bay Area. Meltzer died on December 31, 2016, after suffering a stroke at his home in Oakland.

Sullivan completed this work to open the Royal Albert Hall, and it was performed at the opening of the London International Exhibition of art and industry on 1 May 1871. The concert featured works commissioned from Italy, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Charles Gounod was the French representative. Background The cantata has an appropriately international flavour, telling of war and reunion, based on a 16th-century conflict between Christians and Moors at a time when conflict raged between the Saracen settlements in Northern Africa and the Christian states of the Mediterranean, especially Genoa. The theme is the sorrows and separations that are always incidental to war. The central characters are a sailor and his love, who are separated when he goes to battle, and later reunited. The final chorus, \\"Sink and Scatter, Clouds of War,\\" was later renamed \\"The Song of Peace\\" and was played separately as a concert item. The same year as On Shore and Sea premiered, W. S. Gilbert first worked together with Sullivan, on a burleque-style comic opera, Thespis. Four years later, in 1875, Gilbert and Sullivan's second work together, Trial by Jury, would also be described as \\"a dramatic cantata,\\" and this was Sullivan's only work, other than On Shore and Sea to be so described. On Shore and Sea was finally professionally recorded in 2014, by Victorian Opera Northwest, conducted by Richard Bonynge.Arthur Sullivan: \\"On Shore and Sea\\" & \\"Kenilworth\\" , Dutton Vocalion (CDLX 7310), accessed 2 July 2014 A review of the recording notes that the cantata and a companion piece, The Masque at Kenilworth, \\"emerge in good heart under veteran Richard Bonynge's life-ebullient conviction. The singers, solo and ensemble and orchestra deliver fully satisfactory results ... and more.\\"Barnett, Rob. Review: \\"On Shore and Sea\\" and \\"Kenilworth\\", MusicWeb International, September 14, 2014 Synopsis Near a small seaport on the Italian Riviera near 16th century Genoa, the fleet weighs anchor to the sounds of a joyous song of the sailors as they heave at the windlass and spread the sail. Their brave declaration of their determination to sweep the Saracens from the sea is contrasted with the lament of the wives and mothers, sisters and sweethearts, left sorrowing on the shore. At sea, aboard one of the galleys, in the midnight watch, the thoughts and prayers of Il Marinajo go back to the loved ones left behind and invoke for them the protection of our Lady, Star of the Sea. \\"What doth now the maid I love?\\" he wonders. \\"Does she sleep and dream of me? / Or prays she her aint above Shield of her sailor to be? / Sending her heart, like a dove, / Hither across the sea!\\" Months pass. The fleet appears on the horizon, and the crowd flocks to the port to greet its triumphant return. La Sposina faithfully awaits the return of Il Marinajo, her lover. She looks for him hopefully, but the galley aboard which her sailor served is missing: it has been taken by Moorish sea rovers. Her beloved is captive, or slain. She gives expression to her desolation, amid the sympathizing sorrow of her companions. Her lover, however, is not slain, but a slave, toiling at the oar, under the lash of his Moorish captors. While the Moors are celebrating their triumphs with song and feasting, he obtains the key to the chain securing all the prisoners and exhorts his fellow prisoners to strike for their liberty. The galley slaves rise up against their captors bolstered by their Christian faith and their love for their wives and mothers ashore. They overwhelm their captors, master the galley and steer homewards. Re-entering the port, they are welcomed by their beloved ones. The sorrow of separation is turned to rejoicing; La Sposina and Il Marinajo will live and die in each other's arms. The cantata ends with a paean to the blessedness of Peace, inviting all nations to her temple.

The Nahm equations are formally analogous to the algebraic equations in the ADHM construction of instantons, where finite order matrices are replaced by differential operators. Deep study of the Nahm equations was carried out by Nigel Hitchin and Simon Donaldson. Conceptually, the equations arise in the process of infinite-dimensional hyperkähler reduction. Among their many applications we can mention: Hitchin's construction of monopoles, where this approach is critical for establishing nonsingularity of monopole solutions; Donaldson's description of the moduli space of monopoles; and the existence of hyperkähler structure on coadjoint orbits of complex semisimple Lie groups, proved by Peter Kronheimer, Olivier Biquard, and A.G. Kovalev.  Equations  Let T1(z),T2(z), T3(z) be three matrix-valued meromorphic functions of a complex variable z. The Nahm equations are a system of matrix differential equations : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{dT_1}{dz}&=[T_2,T_3]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] \\\\frac{dT_2}{dz}&=[T_3,T_1]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] \\\\frac{dT_3}{dz}&=[T_1,T_2], \\\\end{align} together with certain analyticity properties, reality conditions, and boundary conditions. The three equations can be written concisely using the Levi-Civita symbol, in the form :\\\\frac{dT_i}{dz}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sum_{j,k}\\\\epsilon_{ijk}[T_j,T_k]=\\\\sum_{j,k}\\\\epsilon_{ijk}T_j T_k. More generally, instead of considering N by N matrices, one can consider Nahm's equations with values in a Lie algebra g.  Additional conditions  The variable z is restricted to the open interval (0,2), and the following conditions are imposed: # T^*_i = -T_i; # T_i(2-z)=T_i(z)^{T};\\\\, # Ti can be continued to a meromorphic function of z in a neighborhood of the closed interval [0,2], analytic outside of 0 and 2, and with simple poles at z = 0 and z = 2; and # At the poles, the residues of (T1,T2, T3) form an irreducible representation of the group SU(2).  Nahm-Hitchin description of monopoles  There is a natural equivalence between # the monopoles of charge k for the group SU(2), modulo gauge transformations, and # the solutions of Nahm equations satisfying the additional conditions above, modulo the simultaneous conjugation of T1,T2, T3 by the group O(k,R).  Lax representation  The Nahm equations can be written in the Lax form as follows. Set : \\\\begin{align} & A_0=T_1+iT_2, \\\\quad A_1=-2i T_3, \\\\quad A_2=T_1-iT_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3 pt] & A(\\\\zeta)=A_0+\\\\zeta A_1+\\\\zeta^2 A_2, \\\\quad B(\\\\zeta)=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\frac{dA}{d\\\\zeta}=\\\\frac{1}{2}A_1+\\\\zeta A_2, \\\\end{align} then the system of Nahm equations is equivalent to the Lax equation : \\\\frac{dA}{dz}=[A,B]. As an immediate corollary, we obtain that the spectrum of the matrix A does not depend on z. Therefore, the characteristic equation : \\\\det(\\\\lambda I+A(\\\\zeta,z))=0, which determines the so-called spectral curve in the twistor space TP1, is invariant under the flow in z.

Hosteen Klah (, 1867– February 27, 1937) was a Navajo artist and medicine man. He documented aspects of Navajo religion and related ceremonial practices. As a traditional nádleehi person, he was both a ceremonial singer and master weaver. Background Hosteen Klah, also spelled Hastiin Klah, was born in 1867 at Bear Mountain, near Fort Wingate, New Mexico. His name essentially means Sir Left Handed in Navajo; in his youth, he was called Ahway Eskay (). Hoksay Nolyae was his father and Ahson Tsosie, of the Clan, was his mother.Lapahie, Harrison, Jr. Hosteen Klah (Sir Left Handed). Lapahie.com. 2001 (retrieved 19 Oct 2009) Klah was born after the Navajos’ return to their homelands from forced government internment at Bosque Redondo. Klah avoided attending government school;Berlo and Philips, 34 rather, he received training in the traditionally male realm of ceremonial practices (chanting and sandpainting) from his uncle. While most individuals master only one or two complete chants, Klah mastered at least eight. Gender Hosteen Klah is most commonly believed to be intersex. An influential figure in the development of Navajo weaving, Klah was relatively unique in that, among the Navajo, weavers are typically women, and ceremonial singers () are usually male. Hosteen Klah, however, was both a weaver and a singer. This was possible because of his particular gender status as a ' (meaning \\"one who is transformed\\" or \\"one who changes\\"). are unique to Navajo culture, and can be born male or intersex. Weaving Identified as a in adolescence, Klah began his training in the traditionally female craft of weaving with his mother and sister in the 1880s. Klah wove his first complete weaving at the 1892–1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he was probably part of a sandpainting demonstration. In 1916, Klah wove imagery from the dance into a rug. He incorporated more representations of Navajo religion into his weaving, including sandpainting imagery by 1919. This practice was regarded as sacrilegious by many Navajo traditionalists and is regarded as such by some Navajo people today. Klah taught his two nieces both his weaving techniques and designs. Wheelwright Museum In 1921, Hosteen Klah was introduced to Mary Cabot Wheelwright, a Boston heiress. The two became friends and collaborated in founding the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Fearing for the future of Navajo religion after witnessing decades of assimilationist assaults on traditional culture by missionaries and the US government, Klah wanted to document Navajo religion and make it available for future generations. The museum was initially called the Navajo House of Prayer and House of Navajo Religion, but then renamed the Museum of Navajo Ceremonial Art, and ultimately renamed in 1977, when the museum repatriated sensitive cultural patrimony back to the Navajo Nation.\\"About the Museum.\\" Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.

Tírechán was a 7th-century Irish bishop from north Connacht, specifically the Killala Bay area, in what is now County Mayo. Background Based on a knowledge of Irish customs of the times, historian Terry O’Hagan has concluded that Tírechán was probably from a wealthy, elite family. Sometime in the 650s, he was sent to Ardbraccan in County Meath as a “fosterling” and student of Ultan, bishop of Ardbraccan. References to numerous geographical areas and to sites such as holy wells, cemeteries, crosses, and churches have led O’Hagan to call Tírechán one of the most “widely travelled” of early medieval writers. Works Tírechán is best known for “Collections,” writings about St. Patrick which have been preserved in the Book of Armagh. The narrative is presented in the first person, as if Patrick himself were the narrator. To research his subject, Tírechán read and interviewed Ultan, and studied the “Confessio” of St. Patrick, the work “Commemoratio Laborum,” and narratives in the oral tradition passed down from “seniors” and “wise ancients.” He seems to have been motivated not only by his esteem for the saint, but also by indignation at the attacks on Patrick’s successors and representatives, the coarbs, perpetrated by “deserters and robber chiefs and soldiers” in Armagh. In addition, Tírechán has been credited as the author of the anonymous Catalogus Sanctorum Hiberniae, which is considered a worthy source of information about early Christianity. However this is unlikely as Grosjean dates it to c.900.'Edition et Commentaire du Catalogus Sanctorum Hiberniae Secundum Diversa Tempora ou de Tribus Ordinibus Sanctorum Hiberniae', by Paul Grosjean Likewise, another of his works, entitled \\"Tripartite Life,\\" provides information about St. Tigris, the sister of St. Patrick. Historians have also used Tírechán for knowledge of the Gaelic manner of dating Easter and the chronology of Irish Christianity. For example, he gave the date of St. Patrick’s death as 469, twenty-five years distant from the commonly assigned date of 493. In addition, the quality of his work is considered reliable enough to serve as a standard of comparison with other primary sources of the period, such as the Acts of St. Ailbe. Tírechán wrote in Latin, and historian Terry O’Hagan indicates that Tírechán’s work should be considered “a work in progress” in that he probably died before his work was complete. His work is often compared to that of his contemporary, Muirchú, who wrote Vita Sancti Patricii (Life of St. Patrick). Floruit Historians have dated Tírechán’s work to the second half of the seventh century based on the date of his tutor’s death (656) and references in his works to events known to have occurred in that period—e. g., plagues, ecclesiastical controversies, and the warring of Irish dynasties. Considering these elements, O’Hagan has placed Tírechán’s active period between 664 and 684.

The \\"Back to the Future Overture\\" on the original album is made up of the following cues as released on the subsequent score album: # Marty's Letter # Clocktower (:50 - 5:35) # '85 Lone Pine Mall (1:41 - end) A 1999 CD release entitled The Back to the Future Trilogy featured additional compositions by Silvestri from the first film. However, these were re-recordings by the Scottish National Orchestra and not Silvestri's original recordings.  \\"Johnny B. Goode\\"  The musical material ostensibly performed by the characters Marty McFly, Marvin Berry and the Starlighters in the film, was recorded by Harry Waters, Jr. as Marvin Berry and Mark Campbell as Marty McFly, and the guitar solo by Tim May. (Campbell and May received a \\"Special Thanks\\" acknowledgment in the film's end credits, with the recording credit going to the fictional characters.) Berry's group also plays the song \\"Night Train\\", first recorded by Jimmy Forrest in 1951. In the film, Marvin Berry, a fictitious cousin of Chuck Berry, phones Chuck and lets him listen to the music. The real \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" was released only three years after the time it is played in the film.  Miscellaneous  The film's musical score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, who later wrote music for Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump and numerous other films, many of them directed by Robert Zemeckis. The memorable themes in his \\"Back to the Future Overture\\" have since been heard in the film's sequels (also scored by Silvestri), in Back to the Future: The Ride, and as ambient music at the Universal Studios theme parks. A remix of the main theme was heard in the opening sequence for MCA-Universal Home Video from 1990 to 1997. The upbeat soundtrack, featuring two new songs by Huey Lewis and the News, also contributed to the film's popularity. \\"The Power of Love\\" became the band's first song to hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated for an Academy Award. Huey Lewis portrayed the high-school band audition judge who rejects Marty McFly's band, the Pinheads, as they perform the short instrumental hard-rock version of \\"The Power of Love\\". There is also another album version of the soundtrack, with only the original score by Silvestri. The only legitimate release was by independent label Intrada, but another so-called \\"DeLorean\\" version released in the 1990s was an unauthorized bootleg.  Score album  In November 2009, Intrada released an official two-disc album containing Silvestri's complete score. The first disc contained the complete orchestral score as recorded for the finished film, along with two source cues that Silvestri wrote. The second disc consisted of alternate approaches that Silvestri took with a large portion of the score, with a darker, more serious tone. None of the songs from the first album are included in this score-only album, and for moments in the film where Silvestri's score was shortened (i.e. the final moments of \\"Einstein Disintegrated\\" and \\"Peabody Barn; Marty Ditches DeLorean\\"), replaced with source music (\\"Town Square\\") or unused (\\"Logo\\"), the full score cue is presented as originally recorded. The set was a limited edition of 10,000 units and sold nearly 6,000 by the end of January 2010. It sold out in August 2014; however, on October 12, 2015 it was made available as an unlimited release in a single-disc edition, featuring the music on disc one of the two- disc set.

He has been described as \\"one of the most important artists to have emerged from the former USSR.\\"Christine Toomey, \\"The barefaced cheek of Boris Mikhailov\\", The Sunday Times, June 3, 2007. Life and work Born in the former Soviet Union, Mykhailov lived and worked for several decades in his hometown of Kharkiv, Ukraine. He received an education as an engineer and started to teach himself photography. Today he is one of the most successful and well known among the photographers who were already active in the Soviet era. His work combines conceptual art and social documentary photography. Mykhailov had his first exhibition at the end of the 1960s. After the KGB found nude pictures of his wife he was laid off his job as an engineer and started to work full-time as a photographer. From 1968 to 1975 he shot several series documenting everyday scenes, the best known of them being the Red Series. In these photographs he mainly used the colour red, to picture people, groups and city-life. Red symbolized the October Revolution, political party and the social system of Soviet society. It is often said that within those works critical elements toward the existing political circumstances can be found. In Mykhailov's Klebrigkeit (1982), he added explanatory notes, or diary-like text. In Case History, considered an important part of contemporary art, he examines the consequences of the breakdown of the Soviet Union for its people. He systematically took pictures of homeless people. It shows the situation of people who after the breakdown of the Soviet Union were not able to find their place in a secure social system. In a very direct way Mykhailov points out his critique against the \\"mask of beauty\\" of the emerging post- Soviet capitalistic way of life. In 2004 Mykhailov first exhibited in Berlin in an exhibition concerning people living at the edge of society. Publications *If I were a German.

The Quietus, Albert Freeman, April 2nd, 2015 Oddie and West created the Xcreteria cassette label to release and distribute recordings from Orphx and related projects. West left in 1995 to focus on the noise project Tropism. By 1997, Oddie and Sealey were working closely with Germany's Hands label and performing regularly in Europe as part of the \\"rhythmic noise\\" scene. Most studio recordings between 1997 and 2008 are credited to Oddie, while more recent recordings are often attributed to both Oddie and Sealey. Since 2009, Orphx has been working primarily with the Sonic Groove label and has become more prominent within the worldwide techno scene. They have appeared at international festivals and celebrated venues around the world, including Berghain, Berlin Atonal, Katharsis, Khidi, Labyrinth, Movement, Mutek, Rural Festival, Unsound, and Tresor. In 2008, Sealey began experimenting with modular synthesizers, which quickly became a key feature of their live performances and recordings. Orphx was featured in I Dream of Wires, a 2014 documentary on the resurgence of modular synthesizers, and Industrial Soundtrack For The Urban Decay, a 2015 documentary on the history of industrial music. Orphx have released sixteen albums and numerous singles on cassette, CD, and vinyl, as well as video releases. In recent years, they have created many remixes for other artists including Conrad Schnitzler, Front Line Assembly, Oscar Mulero, Nomeansno, Perc, and Svreca. Existing side projects include Eschaton (Orphx + Ancient Methods), O/H (Rich Oddie + Dave Foster), Oureboros (Rich Oddie + Aron West), and collaborative live performances and releases with JK Flesh (Justin Broadrick). Orphx releases are often based around social, political or psychological / spiritual themes. Circuitbreaking (Hymen, 2004) was a political commentary on economic globalization, Insurgent Flows (Hands, 2005) was a response to US imperialism in Iraq, and Pitch Black Mirror (Sonic Groove / Hands, 2016) explored themes of depression and redemption.\\"Orphx :: Circuitbreaking (Hymen, CD)\\".

Because the Charter Party is not recognized by the state of Ohio as an official party, Bortz is a registered Republican. He currently serves as the chair of the council's Strategic Growth Committee. Bortz was born in Cincinnati and attended Cincinnati Country Day School for high school; he attended Tufts University for his undergraduate education, and received a J.D. from the University of Arizona. Before his time on the City Council, Bortz served on the Charter Committee Board since 1997, as well as the Cincinnati Electoral Reform Commission, a panel created to study Cincinnati government. Early career Bortz attended high school at Cincinnati Country Day School and later went on to graduate from Tufts University in Boston and studied Jacobean theater at the British American Drama Academy. Upon finishing college, Bortz became a teacher at Country Day for sixth-grade English and 8th grade Philosophy. He accepted a position as the Dean of Faculty for Summerbridge Cincinnati, a summer school program designed to give academically qualified, yet underprivileged students the opportunity to advance their education in a rigorous, nurturing academic environment. Besides his role as teacher and Dean of Faculty for Summerbridge, Chris also coached the football, track, baseball and wrestling teams. After graduating from law school at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Bortz moved to Cincinnati and took on a new role at Towne Properties (a real estate developer) as General Counsel and Special Projects Director. He worked on converting the historic Shillito’s department store into modern residential living. On this and many other projects, Chris worked closely with his uncle, Arn Bortz, who served nine years on the Cincinnati City Council and one term as Mayor of Cincinnati in the early 1980s. His work at Towne Properties has raised controversy where it intersects with his service on the council—a local attorney has pushed for censure of Bortz, since Towne Properties may benefit from a tax increment financing district passed by the council (Bortz abstained from the vote). The same issue has also plagued his vote on Cincinnati's streetcar system, which would serve several properties owned by the company. Cincinnati City Council 2005–2011 Bortz was a co-founder of the GO Cincinnati plan for economic development. In May 2006, he signed onto a motion along with Laketa Cole that created an automatic tax exemption for LEED Certified Silver, Gold, or Platinum standards in order to encourage more sustainable development in Cincinnati. The motion created a Community Development Block Grant as well to help finance structures for builders. He has also been a major advocate for shared services, sitting on the steering committee for GCEP (Government Cooperation and Efficiency Project) In April 2008, Bortz signed onto the motion that moved for $50,000 be allocated for a professional services contact with the Regional Planning Commission in order to match Hamilton County's $50,000. The goal of the motion was to not create a regional government, but to reduce the cost of government while also improving the quality of services provided. In September 2010, Councilman Bortz signed on to a motion to increase economic development in and attract businesses to Cincinnati to enter into a contractual agreement with the Port Authority to implement the GO Cincinnati Plan. As the motion stated, \\"the Port Authority will become the catalytic development corporation tasked with concentrating development expertise and financial resources required to implement GO Cincinnati, creating jobs and private investment in the City of Cincinnati. Bortz ran for reelection in 2011 and received 22,044 votes. He received the tenth most votes out of nine possible spots on city council, and was not re-elected.

Education  Haussler studied art briefly at the Academy of Art in San Francisco in 1971 and then psychotherapy at Immaculate Heart College in Hollywood until 1973, when he transferred to Connecticut College, finishing in 1975 with a major in mathematics and minor in physics. He earned an MS in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo in 1979. Haussler received his PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1982.  Career and research During summers while he was in college, Haussler worked for his brother, Mark Haussler, a biochemist at the University of Arizona studying vitamin D metabolism. They were the first to measure the levels of Calcitriol, the hormonal form of vitamin D, in the human bloodstream. Between 1975 and 1979 he traveled and worked a variety of jobs, including a job at a petroleum refinery in Burghausen, Germany, tomato farming on Crete, and farming kiwifruit, almonds, and walnuts in Templeton, CA. While in Templeton he worked on his Master's degree at nearby California Polytechnic University. Haussler was an assistant professor in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Denver in Colorado from 1982-1986. From 1986 to the present, he has been at UC Santa Cruz, initially in the Computer Science Department, and in 2004 as an inaugural member of the Biomolecular Engineering Department. While pursuing his doctorate in theoretical computer science at the University of Colorado, Haussler became interested in the mathematical analysis of DNA along with fellow students Gene Myers, Gary Stormo, and Manfred Warmuth. Haussler's current research stems from his early work in machine learning. In 1988 he organized the first Workshop on Computational learning Theory with Leonard Pitt. With Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, and Warmuth he introduced the Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework to computational learning theory, solving some problems posed by Leslie Valiant. In the 1990s he obtained various results in information theory, empirical processes, artificial intelligence, neural networks, statistical decision theory, and pattern recognition. Haussler’s research combines mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. He develops new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular function and evolution of the human genome, integrating cross-species comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation.Biello, David. \\"Scientists Identify Gene Difference Between Humans and Chimps\\".

The installation is made up of water collected from Icelandic glaciers. The \\"Library of Water\\" is housed in a former library building in Stykkisholmur on the west coast of Iceland. Horn noticed the building in the 1990s. It is located at the high point of the town, overlooking the harbour and the sea. It was conceived by Horn in 2004 as a sculpture installation and a community center. In 2004, Hauser & Wirth in London was the location of an installation by Horn entitled Agua Viva for the exhibition Rings of Lispector. The installation consisted of interconnecting rubber tiles into which fragments of text from Hélène Cixous' English translation of Clarice Lispector's Agua Viva (The Stream of Life) were embedded into the floor in contrasting shades of tan-colored rubber. Horn manipulated passages of the text to shape partial and overlapping rings and loops, playing with the order and coherence of Lispector's text. The rubber floor's dimensions at Hauser & Wirth London were approximately 1,500 square feet, with each rubber tile 69 inches square. It contained 25 \\"rubber floor drawings\\" with additional plain tiles so that the piece would fit wall to wall.Horn, Roni and Hélène Cixous. Rings of Lispector (Agua Viva). Göttigen: Steidl, 2005.

There has been a great deal of activity in the study of this problem since the early 20th century. A notable advance in this field was a 1941 paper by the American mathematician Jesse Douglas, in which he provided necessary and sufficient conditions for the problem to have a solution; these conditions are now known as the Helmholtz conditions, after the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. Background and statement of the problem The usual set-up of Lagrangian mechanics on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn is as follows. Consider a differentiable path u : [0, T] → Rn. The action of the path u, denoted S(u), is given by :S(u) = \\\\int_{0}^{T} L(t, u(t), \\\\dot{u}(t)) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d} t, where L is a function of time, position and velocity known as the Lagrangian. The principle of least action states that, given an initial state x0 and a final state x1 in Rn, the trajectory that the system determined by L will actually follow must be a minimizer of the action functional S satisfying the boundary conditions u(0) = x0, u(T) = x1. Furthermore, the critical points (and hence minimizers) of S must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations for S: :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial \\\\dot{u}^{i}} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial L}{\\\\partial u^{i}} = 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{for } 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n, where the upper indices i denote the components of u = (u1, ..., un). In the classical case :T(\\\\dot{u}) = \\\\frac{1}{2} m  \\\\dot{u} ^{2}, :V : [0, T] \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, :L(t, u, \\\\dot{u}) = T(\\\\dot{u}) - V(t, u), the Euler-Lagrange equations are the second-order ordinary differential equations better known as Newton's laws of motion: :m \\\\ddot{u}^{i} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial V(t, u)}{\\\\partial u^{i}} \\\\quad \\\\text{for } 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n, :\\\\mbox{i.e. }m \\\\ddot{u} = - abla_{u} V(t, u). The inverse problem of Lagrangian mechanics is as follows: given a system of second-order ordinary differential equations :\\\\ddot{u}^{i} = f^{i} (u^{j}, \\\\dot{u}^{j}) \\\\quad \\\\text{for } 1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n, \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(E)} that holds for times 0 ≤ t ≤ T, does there exist a Lagrangian L : [0, T] × Rn × Rn → R for which these ordinary differential equations (E) are the Euler-Lagrange equations? In general, this problem is posed not on Euclidean space Rn, but on an n-dimensional manifold M, and the Lagrangian is a function L : [0, T] × TM → R, where TM denotes the tangent bundle of M. Douglas' theorem and the Helmholtz conditions To simplify the notation, let :v^{i} = \\\\dot{u}^{i} and define a collection of n2 functions Φji by :\\\\Phi_{j}^{i} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{i}}{\\\\partial v^{j}} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{i}}{\\\\partial u^{j}} - \\\\frac{1}{4} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{i}}{\\\\partial v^{k}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{k}}{\\\\partial v^{j}}. Theorem. (Douglas 1941) There exists a Lagrangian L : [0, T] × TM → R such that the equations (E) are its Euler-Lagrange equations if and only if there exists a non-singular symmetric matrix g with entries gij depending on both u and v satisfying the following three Helmholtz conditions: :g \\\\Phi = (g \\\\Phi)^{\\\\top}, \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(H1)} :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} g_{ij}}{\\\\mathrm{d} t} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{k}}{\\\\partial v^{i}} g_{kj} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial f^{k}}{\\\\partial v^{j}} g_{ki} = 0 \\\\mbox{ for } 1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n, \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(H2)} :\\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ij}}{\\\\partial v^{k}} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial g_{ik}}{\\\\partial v^{j}} \\\\mbox{ for } 1 \\\\leq i, j, k \\\\leq n. \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(H3)} (The Einstein summation convention is in use for the repeated indices.) Applying Douglas' theorem At first glance, solving the Helmholtz equations (H1)-(H3) seems to be an extremely difficult task. Condition (H1) is the easiest to solve: it is always possible to find a g that satisfies (H1), and it alone will not imply that the Lagrangian is singular. Equation (H2) is a system of ordinary differential equations: the usual theorems on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations imply that it is, in principle, possible to solve (H2). Integration does not yield additional constants but instead first integrals of the system (E), so this step becomes difficult in practice unless (E) has enough explicit first integrals. In certain well-behaved cases (e.g. the geodesic flow for the canonical connection on a Lie group), this condition is satisfied. The final and most difficult step is to solve equation (H3), called the closure conditions since (H3) is the condition that the differential 1-form gi is a closed form for each i. The reason why this is so daunting is that (H3) constitutes a large system of coupled partial differential equations: for n degrees of freedom, (H3) constitutes a system of :2 \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n + 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) partial differential equations in the 2n independent variables that are the components gij of g, where :\\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) denotes the binomial coefficient. In order to construct the most general possible Lagrangian, one must solve this huge system! Fortunately, there are some auxiliary conditions that can be imposed in order to help in solving the Helmholtz conditions. First, (H1) is a purely algebraic condition on the unknown matrix g. Auxiliary algebraic conditions on g can be given as follows: define functions :Ψjki by :\\\\Psi_{jk}^{i} = \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_{j}^{i}}{\\\\partial v^{k}} - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Phi_{k}^{i}}{\\\\partial v^{j}} \\\\right). The auxiliary condition on g is then :g_{mi} \\\\Psi_{jk}^{m} + g_{mk} \\\\Psi_{ij}^{m} + g_{mj} \\\\Psi_{ki}^{m} = 0 \\\\mbox{ for } 1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n. \\\\quad \\\\mbox{(A)} In fact, the equations (H2) and (A) are just the first in an infinite hierarchy of similar algebraic conditions. In the case of a parallel connection (such as the canonical connection on a Lie group), the higher order conditions are always satisfied, so only (H2) and (A) are of interest. Note that (A) comprises :\\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) conditions whereas (H1) comprises :\\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) conditions. Thus, it is possible that (H1) and (A) together imply that the Lagrangian function is singular. As of 2006, there is no general theorem to circumvent this difficulty in arbitrary dimension, although certain special cases have been resolved. A second avenue of attack is to see whether the system (E) admits a submersion onto a lower-dimensional system and to try to \\"lift\\" a Lagrangian for the lower-dimensional system up to the higher- dimensional one. This is not really an attempt to solve the Helmholtz conditions so much as it is an attempt to construct a Lagrangian and then show that its Euler-Lagrange equations are indeed the system (E).

Career Schaaf weighed in his prime which was average in that era. In the 1930s he went 2 wins, 1 loss with Tommy Loughran, easily outpointed two future heavyweight world champions in Max Baer in their first fight in 1930 and James J. Braddock in 1931. He also outpointed future title challengers Young Stribling and Tony Galento in 1932. During a second fight with Baer, on 31 August 1932, Schaaf suffered a severe beating and knockout in the final round, hitting the mat two seconds before the final bell, which saved him from an official knockout - Baer won on points. It took several minutes for Schaaf to be revived. Schaaf complained of headaches thereafter, and some observers believe that he suffered brain damage. Six months later, on 10 February 1933, Schaaf fought the huge (more than ) Primo Carnera, and suffered a knockout loss in the 13th round of 15. He fell into a coma, and was rushed to the hospital to undergo surgery. He died on Valentine's Day. An autopsy revealed that Schaaf had meningitis, a swelling of the brain, and he was still recovering from a severe case of influenza when he entered the ring with Carnera. Record Schaaf has an official record of 55–13–2 with 1 no contest and 4 no decisions, but the no-decision bouts are due to the scoring practices of the era.

History Opened on April 26, 1982 it is currently the only entry/exit point between the two countries that handles tourists. The site is at the bottom of Mount Tallul and was close to Raffi Nelson's Nelson Village and the Sonesta Hotel which both closed due to the handing over of the Sinai to Egyptian control in exchange for normalization of relations. Under terms of the deal, Israelis would be able to visit the Red Sea coast from Taba to Sharm el-Sheikh (and Saint Catherine's Monastery) visa free for visits up to fourteen days. In 1999, the terminal handled a record amount of 1,038,828 tourists and 89,422 vehicles. The terminal is open 24 hours a day, every day of the year except for the holidays of Eid ul-Adha and Yom Kippur. In February 2014, a coach taking tourists to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai exploded in Taba shortly before crossing the border to Israel. Three South Korean nationals and one Egyptian national were killed, while 14 South Koreans were injured; the blast was blamed on terrorists. In September 2016, the Israeli side of the crossing was renamed to \\"Menachem Begin Crossing\\" after the late prime minister, who signed the peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.

The New York Times reported: \\"Waltraud Meier, bringing her acclaimed performance as Kundry to the Met for the first time, was seductive and gentle in her first approach to Parsifal, holding in reserve a strength and determination that gave her singing an eerie calm.\\"Edward Rothstein, Review/Opera; A 'Parsifal' at the Met With Meier and Jerusalem, The New York Times, 14 March 1992. The following year, Meier returned to the Met as Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana. Of that performance, The New York Times wrote: > As Santuzza in \\"Cavalleria\\", Waltraud Meier was superb at the first > performance on Friday evening, singing clearly and evenly throughout her > range, carrying lines smoothly and coloring her tone richly. She gradually > worked an incisive, telling edge into her voice without sacrificing its > basic beauty; even her shrieks were musical. And she projected a riveting > dramatic presence, convincingly fragile as well as ferocious.James R. > Oestreich, Review/Opera; 'Cav' and 'Pag' Return to the Met, The New York > Times, 18 February 1993. During the 1990s, Meier also moved into roles within the dramatic soprano repertoire. Between 1993 and 1999, she appeared at Bayreuth as Isolde in Tristan und Isolde staged by Heiner Müller and conducted by Daniel Barenboim. In 1998 she added additional dramatic soprano roles, debuting as Leonore in Fidelio with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, again under the direction of Barenboim, and also appearing as Ortrud in a new Lohengrin production at the Bavarian State Opera. 2000s In 2000, Meier appeared again at Bayreuth, performing the role of Sieglinde in Die Walküre in the \\"Millennium Ring\\" at the 2000 festival staged by Jürgen Flimm and conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli with Plácido Domingo. She also appeared that year as Isolde at the Salzburg Festival, with Lorin Maazel conducting. In 2001 at the opening of the Munich Opera Festival, the singer made her debut in the role of Didon in Hector Berlioz's Les Troyens with Zubin Mehta conducting. In 2003 Meier shared a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording for her contributions as Venus in Tannhäuser under the direction of Daniel Barenboim. She devoted her 2003-2004 season exclusively to recitals and concerts. She performed in Bach's St Matthew Passion and toured throughout Europe, Russia and the United States with a recital program featuring works by Brahms, Schubert and Hugo Wolf. She returned to the opera stage in 2004-2005, including appearances as Carmen in a new production at the Semper Oper in Dresden directed by Katarina Lauterbach. In 2005, she appeared again as Isolde, this time in a new production at the Opéra Bastille in Paris, staged by Peter Sellars and conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen. She also returned to the Vienna State Opera as Kundry in Parsifal. She returned as Kundry in the Met's Parsifal in 2006, appearing opposite Ben Heppner. The New York Times wrote: > The role of Kundry is that of a lone woman surrounded by men, but Waltraud > Meier made it the star turn of the evening. Known as volatile both onstage > and off, Ms. Meier is suited to the part, propelling herself into it like a > wide-bore, high-explosive cannon shell.

In July 2008, Meier appeared as Venus in a production of Tannhäuser in Baden-Baden, directed by Nikolaus Lehnhoff, conducted by Philippe Jordan, and also starring Robert Gambill (Tannhäuser), Stephen Milling (Herrmann), and Camilla Nylund (Elisabeth). The New York Times reported that \\"Ms. Meier, a musician with deep reserves of force and a gift for madness, was the perfect Venus.\\" Michael Kimmelman, History vx. Modernity in German Opera Season, The New York Times, 30 July 2008. On 22 August 2009, she appeared in a televised concert performance of Fidelio at a Henry Wood Promenade Concert in London's Albert Hall in which she also spoke a narration. This was reported as her 2,000th professional engagement. It was conducted by Daniel Barenboim with the West-Eastern Divan (orchestra). In the London Daily Telegraph Rupert Christiansen wrote: > She looked wonderfully elegant and was in good voice - some wild top notes > seemed a small price to pay for her total musical and dramatic involvement > in Leonore's fate.

Their family roots and humble origins began in a very small town named Jalostotitlán, Jalisco, Mexico where meals from the four basic food groups (dairy, meat, grains, and vegetables) were not common to the Gonzalez family. The five brothers were raised on a meager farm the majority of their impressionable years. The parents instilled into their children at very young ages a strong work ethic which enabled them to overcome any obstacles that came their way. Subsistent farming was a normal way of life in this part of the world; everyone had to contribute to the daily activities to make ends meet for the household. When the opportunity arose to immigrate to the United States in the 1960s, the Gonzalez family was thankful to stake their claim in the “land of opportunity”, the United States of America. The five brothers’ strong work ethic was immediately put to use by accepting jobs in restaurants, either as short order cooks or bussing tables. Even though some of the brothers were younger and still going to school, they all were working for wages to help the family make ends meet. In 1985 Enrique Gonzalez Sr. began his journey into the grocery business when he opened the first Vallarta Supermarket (Carniceria Vallarta) in a comfortable 1,000 square foot market in Van Nuys, CA. With weekly sales of $3,500 - $5,000 and 5 employees, it was difficult to maintain. With the opening of the second store in Van Nuys, the other Gonzalez brothers began to get involved in the business. Vallarta Supermarkets embarked on an arduous, but successful adventure to build a reputation of service and excellence. The key to Vallarta’s success was the dedication of the ownership to focus on customer service with a smile and to offer only the highest quality products to its customers. The Gonzalez family capitalized on serving the Hispanic community, a niche that was not addressed by the big chain stores. Vallarta Supermarkets offered a wide variety of Latin foods and products which could only be found at its store: meat cut to order Latin style (ranchera, diesmillo, lomo de res), spices, hot foods ready to eat, sweet breads made daily, and fresh produce in addition to everything else you would expect from a traditional grocery store. Since then, Vallarta Supermarkets has grown to a total of 52 stores throughout California (Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Kern, San Diego, Santa Barbara, Tulare, Orange, Fresno and Madera counties). The company employs approximately 8,000 employees. Vallarta Supermarkets intends to positively impact 100 communities by the year 2030. That means opening new stores at a rate of 3 locations per year. As the business has grown, great customer service and providing the highest quality products at great prices has remained their constant goal. The Gonzalez family has adhered to their strong work ethic and has made it part of their company culture ensuring that all their employees strive for excellence. For over 25 years Vallarta Supermarkets has maintained an image characterized by family values, service, cleanliness, beautiful decor, a pleasant shopping ambiance, and a large variety of products in all departments. Vallarta Supermarkets offers its clientele exceptional quality, outstanding service, and great prices that keep them coming back to the stores. The Gonzalez partners meet weekly to discuss business strategies and how to continue improving customer service. Vallarta offers the following departments: * Full and Self Service Meat (Carniceria) - Wide variety of beef, pork, and chicken * Seafood * Freshly made Tortillas (Tortilleria) * Mexican Kitchen (Taqueria) - Hot Foods with in-store dining area * Bakery (Panaderia) * La Isla (The Island) - Aguas Frescas/Drinks, Ice Cream. Juice Bar/Jugos Frescos/Atoles y Champurrados * Cremeria (Salsas, yogurts, Latin style cheeses, store prepared “chorizo”) - Sliced deli meats * Deli * Produce * Health & Beauty Care and General Merchandise * Grocery * Specialty foods from Mexico, Central & South America Vallarta supports the Children’s Miracle Network, Aisles of Smiles, and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. In addition, Vallarta is very involved in the communities where the stores are located.

He was a founding member of Australian rock group Zoot in 1965, with Beeb Birtles, and were later joined by Rick Brewer and Rick Springfield. As a solo artist Cotton released the albums, Best Seat in the House (1980), It's Rock 'n' Good Fun (1984) and Let the Children Sing (1994). In April 1980 his biggest solo hit, \\"Same Old Girl\\", which was co-written by Cotton, peaked at No. 6 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. He acted in the TV soap opera, The Young Doctors (1979), and on stage as Joseph in the theatre production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat (1983). He presented TV shows, Summer Rock (1979 and 1980) and The Early Bird Show (1985 to 1989). In 1996 he formed Burns Cotton & Morris with fellow 1960s pop singers, Ronnie Burns and Russell Morris. In 2000 Burns retired from the trio and, with Jim Keays, they became Cotton Keays & Morris. In May 2012, Cotton was diagnosed with liver cancer and died on 27 July 2012, aged 62. Biography Darryl Grant Cotton was born on 4 September 1949 in Adelaide and grew up in the suburb of Christies Beach. His mother was Gloria. In 1965 Cotton was the lead vocalist for The Murmen, when he formed a pop rock covers band, Down the Line, with local rivals, Times Unlimited's Gerard Bertelkamp (later known as Beeb Birtles) on vocals and bass guitar, John D'Arcy on guitar and vocals, and Ted Higgins on drums. In mid-1967 the group changed their name to Zoot and increased the original content played. They entered the South Australian heats of Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, finishing second in a tense contest to The Masters Apprentices. In mid-1968, Zoot relocated to Melbourne, where their management promoted them under the slogan \\"Think Pink – Think Zoot\\" – all band members wore pink costumes; Cotton's car was repainted pink; his pet dog, Monty, had its fur dyed pink; and the venue, Birties Disco, was pink-themed throughout. In September Rick Brewer, Cotton's bandmate from The Murmen, joined on drums. Cotton and Birtles co-wrote \\"Little Roland Lost\\" which was issued as the B-side on Zoot's June 1969 single, \\"Monty & Me\\". The A-side was produced by Go-Set writer, Ian Meldrum (later hosted TV pop music series, Countdown), while the B-side was produced by Terry Britten. \\"Monty & Me\\" – referenced Cotton's dog – which reached the Go-Set Top 40. Zoot were voted Top Australian Group in Go-Set's pop poll published in June, just ahead of The Masters Apprentices and Brisbane group, The Avengers. In the same poll Russell Morris was most popular Male Vocal. In July they undertook a tour through the eastern Australian states with Ronnie Burns, The Sect and Jon Blanchfield on the bill. In September Rick Springfield (ex-Wickedy Wak) joined on lead guitar and vocals. Zoot undertook the Operation Starlift Tour with other Australian artists including Johnny Farnham, The Masters Apprentices, Burns, Morris, Johnny Young and The Valentines. For Zoot, the national tour brought increased media ridicule, peer envy and scorn from detractors – much of the criticism was homophobic, for their continuing use of pink outfits, where they were described as \\"pretty pink pansies\\". In December when the tour reached Brisbane, Cotton was injured in an assault by street toughs. Early in 1970 Zoot finally discarded their pink outfits and attempted to shift their image and music towards heavier rock from the earlier teeny-bopper pop. In December that year, they released their most successful single, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", which was a hard rock cover version of The Beatles' ballad and by March 1971 it had peaked in the top five. On Go-Sets Top Records for the Year of 1971 it finished at No. 12. In May 1971 despite the top 30 charting of their next single, \\"Freak\\", the group disbanded. Cotton and Birtles formed Darryl and Beeb as a pop, soft rock duo but soon changed their name to Frieze when they were sponsored by Frieze Brothers (a clothing company). In September they issued a cover version of the Mann-Weil track, \\"Feelings\\", on Sparmac Records. In March 1972, the Cotton-penned single, \\"Try Yourself\\", was issued under the name, Darryl and Beeb Frieze. In May they followed with their debut album, 1972 B. C., on Warner Brothers, using session musicians. By June Frieze had disbanded and Cotton issued \\"Why Do Little Kids Have to Die\\", from 1972 B. C. as his debut solo single. In July Cotton travelled to the United Kingdom while Birtles joined Mississippi (previously known as Allison Gros and then as Drummond), which, in 1975, evolved into Little River Band. Early in 1973 Cotton joined United States-based group, Friends, with Michael Lloyd and Australian-raised singer-songwriter Steve Kipner (ex-Steve and the Board, Tin Tin). They issued a single, \\"Gonna Have a Good Time\\" (a cover of The Easybeats's song \\"Good Times\\") backed by \\"Would You Laugh\\" which was co- written by Cotton with Lloyd and Kipner. Friends followed with self-titled album before Cotton and Lloyd left to form a vocal trio, Cotton, Lloyd and Christian with Chris Christian. In 1975 the trio issued a self titled album, and the single, \\"I Go to Pieces\\", which reached the Billboard Hot 100. Their second album, Number Two, appeared in 1976. In April 1977 they released another single, \\"Crying in the Rain\\". Cotton based himself in Los Angeles where he also worked as a singer and songwriter and performed with Olivia Newton-John, The Osmonds, Shaun Cassidy and Cliff Richard. His songwriting credits include work for Donny Osmond and Marie Osmond, Engelbert Humperdinck and The New Seekers. In early 1978 Cotton returned to Australia, signed with Oz Records and, in August, released a solo single, \\"Don't Let It Get to You\\", which later appeared on his solo album Best Seat in the House (1980). From January 1979 Cotton hosted a TV music series, Summer Rock, on Adelaide's Nine Network. Other solo singles followed, \\"I Don't Want to Lose You\\" (February 1979) and \\"Glamour Girl\\" (July). At about that time Cotton acted on the Australian soap opera The Young Doctors for one season and followed with another series of Summer Rock in early 1980. In February 1980, he released his most successful solo single, \\"Same Old Girl\\", which reached top ten on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. \\"Same Old Girl\\" was co-written with former band mate Christian. Cotton's work in 1980 earned him an award for Best Solo Male Performance, 10 years after Zoot had won a similar award for a group. Best Seat in the House was issued on EMI Records and was produced by Christian. Cotton formed a backing band, The Charts, with Joey Amenta on lead guitar (ex-Taste, Redhouse, Russell Morris Band), Andy Buchanan on drums, Randy Bulpin on guitar (Mondo Rock), Terry Davidson on keyboards and Simon Gyllies on bass guitar (Mondo Rock). They toured the pub and club circuit and by 1981 were retitled as The Divers with Amenta, Davidson, Spiro Philipas on bass guitar and Robert Ross on drums. From May 1980 to November 1981 Cotton issued three more singles but none charted. In 1983 Cotton appeared in the lead role of the Australian stage production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In 1984 he released his second solo album, It's Rock 'n' Good Fun on Hammard Records. From 1985 to 1989 Cotton was a co-host, with Marie Van Maaren, on Network Ten's The Early Bird Show, a Saturday morning children's TV variety show, where he worked alongside Marty the Monster. In 1989, Cotton was awarded the Advance Australia Award for his services to the community, acknowledging his support and assistance to numerous charities and public organisations. He also sang the lyrics to the song \\"Surfin\\" from the TV programme Pugwall's Summer. In 1994 Cotton released a children's album, Just for Kids, on DC Records. In 1996 he formed Burns Cotton & Morris with fellow 1960s pop singers, Ronnie Burns and Russell Morris, which issued a self-titled album. The album included three tracks from each artist's earlier career and three new songs. In 2000 Burns retired from the trio and, with Jim Keays (ex-The Masters Apprentices), they became Cotton Keays & Morris, which also released a self-titled album. From 1987 Cotton performed with the Australian Youth Choir and in 2001 they released an album, Celebrating Federation, Cotton was also the patron of the associated National Institute of Youth Performing Arts Australia. His solo performances were backed by the Darryl Cotton Band, which, in 2005, consisted of Ashley Robinson on guitar and backing vocals, Peter Valentine on keyboards and backing vocals, Alejandro Vega on drums and percussion, Tim Wilson on saxophone, flute and backing vocals; and were sometimes augmented by Lisa Edwards and Wendy Stapleton on vocals. Darry Cotton Band performed at corporate functions with a repertoire that included music from 1960s pop to 1990s and early 2000s work. In 2011 Zoot reunited for a short performance cruise out from Miami with the line-up of Cotton joined by Birtles, Brewer and Springfield. In May 2012, Cotton was diagnosed with liver cancer, his manager Jeff Joseph announced that Cotton was receiving chemotherapy \\"[h]e is resting comfortably and letting the treatment take its course\\". On 27 July 2012 Cotton died. On 12 May he had performed his last gig, with Cotton Keays & Morris, at a Sydney RSL club. In July Keays recalled, \\"[a]bout six weeks ago... we were up in Sydney, he's an asthmatic and used to cough a lot, [...] we were driving back from the gig and he was just coughing so badly, and Russell was driving, and said 'Do you want us to drive you to the hospital?'\\". Personal life On 16 July 1977 Darryl Cotton married Cheryl Forehead; the couple had two children. Cotton died on 27 July 2012, eleven days after the couple's 35th anniversary, aged 62.

Festivals Chamundi Temple atop Chamundi Hill at Mysore A lit up Mysore Palace, the center of all Dasara festivities held in Mysore Dasara Dasara is the Nadahabba (state-festival) of the state of Karnataka. It is also known as Navaratri (Nava-ratri = nine-nights) and is a 10-day festival with the last day being Vijayadashami, the most auspicious day of Dasara. Dasara usually falls in the month of September or October. According to a legend, Vijayadashami denotes the victory of truth over evil and was the day when the Hindu Goddess Chamundeshwari killed the demon Mahishasura. Mahishasura is the demon from whose name Mysore has been derived. The Dasara festivities were first started by the Wodeyar King, Raja Wodeyar I (1578–1617 CE) in 1610.Detailed account of the Dasara festival celebrated at Mysore is provided by The Mysore Palace is lit up on all the 10 days of Dasara. The festivities begin with the Wodeyar royal couple performing a special puja to Goddess Chamundeshwari in the Chamundi Temple located on the top of Chamundi Hill at Mysore. This would be followed by a special durbar (royal assembly).Kings wore the traditional Mysore Peta as headgear during the Durbar (court of Indian or princely state's kings) time or in a ceremonial procession during the Dasara celebrations. It was during the reign of Krishnaraja Wodeyar III in 1805, when the king started the tradition of having a special durbar in the Mysore Palace during Dasara; which was attended by members of the royal family, special invitees, officials and the masses. The King and men attending King's court wore the conventional attire called the durbar dress which comprised a black long coat with white trousers and a compulsory Mysore Peta.

Squirell hair was used as a brush by tying the hair with a silken thread and inserting them into the narrow end of a quill. A cloth spread over a wooden plank formed the painting board. Properly burnt tamarind sticks were used as a sketching charcoal. The main attraction of these paintings was the gesso work in which gold foils were pasted on appropriate regions on the painting. Gesso was used for depicting intricate designs of clothes, jewellery and architectural details. Stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Bhagavata Purana and Jain epics formed the basis of these paintings. Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar (Krishnaraja Wodeyar III) was instrumental in the growth of the Mysore painting form and is said to have commissioned more than 1000 portraits during his reign.

In 2009 Siren released the band from their deal and their self promoted 2011 album \\"Until The End Of Time\\" is yet to achieve any certification. Annabel Fay was signed to Siren from 2005 until 2011. Annabel's debut single, \\"Lovin' You Baby\\", was released to the New Zealand market in late 2006. It peaked at #9 and spent 8 weeks on the New Zealand Top 40 Singles chart. Following her second single, \\"Shake It Off\\", the album release date was in August 2007 to coincide with the release of her third single, \\"Strong\\". This self-titled album was recorded with producer Brady Blade, formerly Emmylou Harris's drummer, who also produced Brooke Fraser's debut album. Annabel Fay debuted on the Official New Zealand Top 40 Albums Chart on August 27, 2007 and peaked at #30. She earned her a Vodafone NZ Music Award nomination for Best Female Artist in 2008. Her second album, Show Me the Right Way, was released by EMI on April 11, 2011. The album's lead single, \\"River\\", received massive airplay and peaked at #10 on the New Zealand Top 40 Singles Chart. The album peaked on the Official New Zealand Top 40 Albums Chart at #8 and stayed on the chart for five weeks. Distribution in New Zealand is through Universal.

Built between 1979 and 1982, it was the stumbling block in negotiations between Israel and Egypt over the final border between the two countries. After months of negotiation and a decision by the UN to grant Egypt the tiny strip of land, the hotel was finally sold to Egypt. The hotel was part of the Hilton brand for nearly 30 years from 1990 until 2017, when it was renovated and reopened as the Taba Hotel & Nelson Village by Deutsche Hospitality. History Eliyahu Paposchado built the property as the Aviya Sonesta Beach Hotel () beginning in 1979, from Eilat and next to Raffi Nelson's Kfar Nelson (), while the Sinai was under Israeli control. It was immediately considered one of Israel's premier hotels and would later prove to be a problem in the ensuing talks between the two nations. After the peace agreements were signed in 1979 between the two nations, the status of the hotel and village were to be decided on future negotiations. In 1986, an international panel ruled that the land would be returned to Egypt, but that Israelis would be free to visit the tiny strip without paying a tax (to this day tourists do not pay a tax when travelling between Eilat and the hotel). In January 1989 the hotel and adjacent village was turned over to Egypt. Remnants of the hotel's past are still prominent within the hotel. On the bottom floor, there is an high wall relief, made in 1980–81 with a Hebrew inscription by the Jerusalem sculptor, Daniel Kafri. The hotel became the Hilton Taba in 1990. Hilton Taba (view from the Gulf of Aqaba) It was very popular with Israeli tourists until it was targeted by terrorists in the 2004 Sinai Bombings. 34 people died and hundreds were wounded in the attack. Since then, the hotel has undergone major renovations and has seen a drastic drop in Israeli tourists. Hilton Hotels International denied liability to the victims of the terror attack on its grounds and refused to compensate its guests. Some victims sought compensation through legal challenges in Miami and New York, but the lawsuits were ultimately dismissed for forum non conveniens. Subsequently an Israeli court ruled that the victims were not entitled to compensation by the Hilton corporation. In 2017, the hotel was purchased by Deutsche Hospitality, renovated, and reopened as the Taba Hotel & Nelson Village. The operator is Steigenberger Hotels and Resorts.

It focuses on issues surrounding the Resource Management Act 1991 and is made up of resource management professionals who are committed to improving environmental outcomes within New Zealand. History EDS was established in 1971 by a group of law students and scientists. The idea behind EDS was to bring together the disciplines of science, law and planning to advocate for the environment. Since its inception, EDS has had a long and largely successful history of litigating environmentally significant cases. Early cases EDS was involved in include the Huntly water rights case, litigation concerning LPG terminals, the Aramoana Smelter, the Clyde High Dam, several Think Big projects and a proposed resort development at Karikari in the Far North. During the 1980s EDS began a substantive involvement in mining cases and was instrumental in persuading the New Zealand government to change the law to enable better public involvement and more emphasis on the environmental effects of mining. There was a special focus on the Coromandel Peninsula, where EDS was instrumental in preventing a proposed large-scale open-cast mine from proceeding at Otama Beach. EDS has a long history of involvement in cases concerning water. The Society was involved with other groups in an effort to get water conservation orders established in law after a successful opposition to a series of dams on the Motu River. Indeed, EDS assisted the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust to obtain the first ever national water conservation order for that wild and scenic river and went on to support similar orders over the Ahuriri and Rakaia Rivers in the South Island. In 2002, EDS litigated on the climate change impacts and the carbon dioxide from Otahuhu Power Station gas thermal power station. EDS appealed the Otahuhu C resource consents granted by Auckland Regional Council. EDS argued that the predicted annual emissions of 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide would contribute to climate change via the greenhouse effect and that the consent conditions should require complete carbon offsetting by planting of new forests. The Environment Court agreed with the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change and concluded that the proposed CO2 emissions would be an \\"adverse effect of some consequence\\". The court declined to impose the forest offsetting condition due to concerns over its \\"efficacy, appropriateness and reasonableness\\".Environmental Defence Society (Incorporated) v Auckland Regional Council and Contact Energy A183/2002 NZEnvC 315;NZRMA 492;(2003) 9 ELRNZ 1 (6 September 2002) More recently EDS has become increasingly involved in providing support and capacity building for individuals, community organisations and councils; in undertaking research and policy analysis on key environmental issues; and in profiling key issues through seminars and conferences. EDS is now implementing a major new initiative on oceans to chart the way forward for reform. EDS is looking at policy framework for marine mammals protection, marine protected areas and marine spatial planning. In its research and policy work EDS seeks to build constructive partnerships and relationships with business, government and other groups across civil society.

This novel and four others (A Countess Below Stairs, A Company of Swans, The Reluctant Heiress, and The Morning Gift) were reissued between 2007 and 2009 for the young adult market.Eva Ibbotson at Fantastic Fiction Synopsis Set in early 1940s Austria, the novel centers around a young English woman named Ellen Carr. Raised in a family of prominent suffragettes, Ellen, to the surprise of all friends and family, grows up with a great love of all things domestic. Inspired by Henny, the servant/partner of her grandfather, she enjoys cooking, cleaning and the various other chores that her mother and aunts have abandoned in their academic and feminist pursuits. While Ellen attends University to please her family, she leaves school before her final exams when Henny contracts cancer in order to be at her side. After Henny's death, Ellen travels to Henny's homeland of Austria to become housemother at Hallendorf School, a progressive school for children stocked with characters of all sorts. Ellen soon finds that everything is not as it should be— the school is based on the Arts and is an institution for wealthy children; however, the parents of many of these children have used the school simply as a place out of sight and mind, in which to dump children that they see as nuisances. Ellen takes on the role of mother to these children, giving them the love and encouragement that they deserve. In the beautiful Austrian countryside Ellen discovers an eccentric world occupied by wild children and even wilder teachers, experimental dancers and a tortoise on wheels. And then there is the particularly intriguing, enigmatic, and very handsome Marek: part-time gardener, fencing teacher, and the most romantic, compelling, swoon-worthy hero figure since Mr Darcy. Ellen is instantly attracted to the mysterious gardener, but Hitler’s Reich is already threatening their peaceful world. But when she discovers that Marek is actually a famous musician working with various Resistances to smuggle Jews to safety, Ellen begins to realize the depth of her feelings for him—and the danger their newfound love faces in the shadow of war.

Traffic signs may provide information about the law, warn about dangerous conditions and guide roadway users. Traffic signs vary depending upon their use, using different symbols, colors and shapes for easy identification. Types of signs=Regulatory signs on the road No left turn Regulatory signs “give a direction that must be obeyed.” Often these signs show content or action that is either mandatory or prohibited and these two modes are signified by colour (i.e. blue and red), orientation (i.e. filled circle and an open circle with diagonal line through the centre) and/or shape (i.e. square and triangle).Ministry of Transportation of Ontario. (2002). The Official Driver’s Handbook. Queen’s Printer for Ontario Warning signs Warning signs give a warning of that there are dangerous or unusual conditions ahead. Often these signs have a greater more conspicuous presence than a regulatory sign. These signs often do not have much text on them, as they should be internationally understood due to the nature of the message that they are conveying. Information/directional signs Shows route to airport Information signs give information about direction and distance, usually guiding drivers to destinations, facilities, services and attractions. Often these signs have names of locations with an arrow pointing towards the direction of the destination and a number giving the approximate distance. Temporary condition signs These non-permanent temporary signs are erected to warn drivers of unexpected conditions such as road work zones, diversions, detours, lane closures and traffic control. Often these signs are portable and can also be digital variable message signs. Interaction design and traffic signs When designing traffic signs it is recommended to follow the four basic steps of interaction design: Identifying needs and establishing user requirements, developing alternative designs, building interactive versions, evaluating the designs.Preece, Jennifer; Rogers, Yvonne; Sharp, Helen. (2002). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Identifying needs and establishing requirements Drivers, cyclists, pedestrians and other types of pedestrians are the users that will be interacting with traffic signs. These users are using the roadways for transportation purposes and must receive information about the roadways and their destinations as they are traveling. Developing alternative designs This task is divided into two categories: conceptual design and physical design. Conceptual design will be the discussion of alternative traffic signs and ways of conveying information to the users. Physical design will be the discussion of what physical aspects (i.e. colour, shape, orientation) will be on the sign to convey the messages identified during the conceptual design. Building interactive versions This task is the actual building of traffic signs. These can be prototypes of a very low or very high fidelity. Evaluating designs This task is the testing of the prototypes and actual signs in order to determine if they convey the desired message in the desired time by the appropriate users. This will let the users know the usability of their signs. Design principles Traffic sign comprehension and understandability are higher when the signs comply with ergonomic principles.Shinar, David; Dewar, Robert E.; Summala, Heikki; Zakowska, Lidia. (2003). Traffic Symbol Comprehension: A Cross-Cultural Study. Ergonomics 46(15), p 1549-1565 It is recommended to follow the below principles in order to increase driver comprehension and understandability. Spatial compatibility The matching between the physical symbols on a sign with the literal directions/information the sign is trying to convey. “The physical arrangement in space, relative to the position of information and directions.” :*Application: Having a regulatory sign that informs a driver they must turn right, have an image of an arrow that curves to the right. Conceptual compatibility The correct association between the physical symbols on a sign and the information the sign is trying to convey. Good conceptual compatibility means that a driver will know the meaning of a symbol without having to reflect and interpret its meaning. :*Application: Having an information sign that represents an airport, have an image of an airplane. Physical representation The similarity between the information that is being represented and the actual content on a sign. Good physical representation means that a driver will experience what is shown on a sign. :*Application: Having a warning sign that means to watch for pedestrians have an image a person. Frequency The frequency that which a sign appears will determine how familiar it is to drivers. Good frequency means that the sign is used often and that the meaning of its contents is well known. :*Application: Having a regulatory sign that informs drivers of the current speed limit of the roadway be frequently placed along every road. Standardization The extent to which any sign can be grouped into a type of sign with similar or equal shape, colour and orientation. Good standardization means that all signs of the same type have the same template of shape, colour and orientation. Ideally standardization should be across cities, regions and countries.\\\\- Ben-Bassat, Tamar, and David Shinar. (2006). Ergonomic guidelines for traffic sign design increase sign comprehension. Human Factors, 48(1), p 182-195 :*Application: Having all warning signs have a diamond shape with a black border and a yellow background. Singular functionality The representation of only a single meaning for a single sign. Good singular functionality means that a sign that gives information should not also imply a regulatory meaning or another piece of related information. :*Application: Having an information sign that signifies the beginning of a school zone should not also be meant to imply that the speed limit in this area is reduced. Visibility The extent to which any sign can be seen. It should be visible by drivers of all age groups from an appropriate distance that will allow the driver to react to the signs contents. Visibility also means that the sign has enough contrast with the background to be conspicuous and that the contents on the sign have enough contrast with the background of the sign to be conspicuous.Wickens, Christopher D.; Gordon, Sallie E.; Liu, Yili. (1998). An Introduction to Human Factors Engineering. New York: Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers Inc. :*Application: Having a white regulatory sign have a black border with a black symbol and a red highlight. “Solar-powered smart street signs that light up for easy reading at night, can add to readability.” Stridger, Ruth W. (2003). How Readable Are Your Street Signs? Better Roads, 73(8), p 36-38 Conclusion It has been shown that following these principles when designing traffic signs will make the signs more comprehensible. Minimizing the time and effort it takes drivers to interpret traffic signs may help to reduce driver mental workload and frustration. It is also especially important to attempt to follow the standardization principle because, due to the increase in globalization, many drivers may be visiting internationally. It is also particularly important to follow the principle of visibility because of the increasing average age, and thus vision difficulties, of drivers.

It was acquired in 2016 by Citizen Holdings of Tokyo, Japan.https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-interview-geneva-based-frederique- constants-ceo-monnier The company was established in 1988 by Peter Stas and Aletta Stas-Bax (a Dutch married couple). Frédérique Constant Art Deco series Before the sale to Citizen, Frédérique Constant SA was owned by Union Horlogère Holding B.V., which also owned Alpina Watches International SA, and Ateliers deMonaco SA, and was, in turn, owned by Frédérique Constant Holding SA. History The company was founded in 1988 by Aletta Francoise Frédérique Stas-Bax and Peter Constant Stas (a Dutch married couple). Its name is derived from the names of great-grandparents of each founder – specifically Frédérique Schreiner (1881–1969) and Constant Stas (1880–1967), the latter of whom founded a company producing watch dials in 1904.Barquero, J.D.

Frederique Constant has grown into one of the larger Swiss watch manufacturers. In 2011, production reached over 120,000 watches, sold in over 2,700 points of sale in more than 100 countries. Frederique Constant positions itself in the accessible luxury segment, with most of its watches selling in the price range of CHF 1,000–5,000 retail. In 2011, the company said that it expected to continue growing at an annual rate of 25%, doubling in size every three years. In 2013, Aletta and Peter Stas (with two other contributors) wrote a book Live your passion – Building a watch manufacture, about their passion for watchmaking and the history of Frederique Constant. In May 2016, Citizen Holdings (which also owns Bulova) announced its intention to acquire Frederique Constant Holding SA, which included Union Horlogère Holding B.V., which in turn included Frederique Constant SA, Alpina Watches International SA, and Ateliers deMonaco SA.The same year, the Frederique Constant Group acquires its main distributors, including its largest market, Macher SA in Switzerland, founded in 2002 by Alexis Gouten. Manufacture facilities Frederique Constant operates a manufacture in Plan-les-Ouates measuring 3200 square metres, divided over four floors, with sectors for movement component production, movement assembly, watch assembly, and quality control. Numerically controlled machinery is located in a large workshop in the basement, where all component manufacturing is concentrated. Movement and watch assembly, as well as quality control, are primarily organized on the first floor. Frederique Constant extends Geneva manufacturing facility with an additional 3000 m2 space, bringing the Frederique Constant Group’s headquarters up to 6200 m2. Ownership structure and sister brands Prior to the sale to Citizen, Frederique Constant Holding SA owned Union Horlogère Holding B.V., which also owned Alpina Watches International SA, a watch manufacture founded in 1883 by Gottlieb Hauser, a watchmaker in Winterthur who founded the Swiss Watchmakers Corporation (\\"Union Horlogère Suisse\\"). Additionally, Union Horlogère Holding B.V. also owned Ateliers deMonaco SA, a watch manufacture founded in 2008 (the same year as Frédérique Constant SA) by Peter Stas with two other partners. All three companies (Frédérique Constant SA, Alpina Watches International SA, and Ateliers deMonaco SA) are based in Plan-les-Ouates, Geneva, Switzerland. These companies have together been referred to as the Frederique Constant Group. Products and product features=Heart Beat movement In 2001, Frederique Constant began the development of its first watch movement in cooperation with the École d'Horlogerie de Genève, École d'Ingenieurs de Genève and the Horloge Vakschool Zadkine. The Heart Beat Manufacture has a characteristic bridge for the balance wheel on the front side of the movement. Having the bridge for the balance wheel on the front side made it possible to have the spiral and fine regulation on the front side as well, creating the company's \\"Heart Beat\\" design. The company patented this construction as an innovation in watch design technology. The company's \\"Heart Beat Manufacture\\" won the \\"Watch of the Year\\" Award of Horloges Magazine in the category up to €3000 in 2005. As of 2014, the company has brought 15 distinct movements to the market, starting with the introduction of its original Heart Beat in 2004. Silicon escapement wheel Frederique Constant escapement wheel made of silicon In February 2007, Frederique Constant began production of the Silicon escapement wheel (first introduced to the industry by Patek Philippe in 2005). The company introduced the Heart Beat Calibre FC 935 Silicium in October 2007. It implements new high-tech materials to create better, more precise and more reliable mechanical watches. Deep reactive-ion etching is used to shape silicon wafers into escapement wheels, pallets, and plateaus. Silicon is lighter, harder and stronger than metal. Etched into tiny skeletal structures that would be impossible to form with metal, it becomes the featherweight heart of a mechanism that can run at a far higher accuracy. The silicon parts are virtually frictionless, so need no lubrication, and are immune to most external forces. And when bonded with a carbon coating, silicon's only real drawback, brittleness, can also be overcome. Tourbillon  Frederique Constant escapement made of silicon; anker, wheel and plateau In April 2008, Frederique Constant created a tourbillon with a silicon escape-wheel and, for the first time, an amplitude of over 300 degrees between its vertical and horizontal positions. Coupled with rapid oscillation, this gives the watch an unusually high level of precision. Manufacture Frederique Constant offers 15 manufacture (in-house) movements in addition to their mainstream line of ETA-powered watches. The high-end handwinding FC-910 caliber, introduced in 2004, was joined by Tourbillon in 2008 and a mainstream FC-7xx caliber range in 2009. The addition of the second-generation manufacture movements makes the company unusual in offering a complete in-house watch for under €2,000 MSRP. Watches with in-house movements are identified with the word, \\"Manufacture\\" in their model name, or can be identified by looking for the tourbillon, FC-9xx, or FC-7xx movement in their specifications. Worldtimer  Frederique Constant introduced a Worldtimer watch in 2012 with a unique mechanism, adjusted solely via the crown. The Worldtimer function is used by selecting the desired city and placing it at the 12 o'clock position on the dial. Internal discs automatically synchronise, and after that, it is possible to see what time it is in any of the 24 cities on the dial. In addition, thin discs also indicate at a glance whether it is day (white disc) or night (black disc). Frederique Constant Runabout Runabout product line The Runabout range is a main collection of Frederique Constant and is designed to pay tribute to the runabout gentlemen's sports boats of the Roaring Twenties. The company has sponsored the Hélice Classique Genève and Lake Tahoe Concours d'Elegance boating events, which have showcased vintage wood boats. Vintage rally line and sponsorships Since 2004, Frederique Constant has sponsored several classic car rallies worldwide, and it develops limited-edition watches for each of these sponsorships.

Horological Smartwatch In 2015, the Frederique Constant and Alpina brands introduced the \\"Horological Smartwatch\\", a smartwatch product with motion and sleep tracking functions that uses a secondary analog dial rather than a screen for its display – giving the timepiece a more classic look than other such devices. The lack of a display screen also provides significant power saving – enabling a battery life of two years or more, in contrast to other smartwatches that must be charged daily. This product line uses \\"MotionX\\" core technology, licensed from the California-based company Fullpower Technologies and was developed in a joint venture known as Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT). Hybrid Manufacture Smartwatch In 2018, Frederique Constant reveals the world's first mechanical smartwatch, the Hybrid Manufacture that fuses smartwatch technology with a mechanical movement.

Against Kansas State University, he set a school single-game record with 3 returns for 1,515 yards, including a 99-yarder for a touchdown and tied the NCAA single-game record with 247 total kick returns yards. As a junior, he opened the season as a starter at split end, but suffered a broken wrist in the eighth game against the University of Colorado Boulder. The injury forced him to switch to cornerback for the final 4 games. He tallied 12 receptions for 208 yards and 2 touchdowns, while ranking third in the conference in kickoff returns (16) and second in return yards (338).

Hughes was a special teams standout, leading the Big Eight Conference in kickoff returns in each of his last three years and his team in each of his four seasons. He finished as the school's record-holder in kickoff returns and second all-time in career punt returns. He finished his college career with 31 receptions for 451 yards, 33 carries for 81 yards, 5 receiving touchdowns, a 12.3-yard average on 68 punt returns, a 23.4-yard average and a touchdown on 65 kickoff returns.

Professional career=New Orleans Saints Hughes was selected by the New Orleans Saints in the fifth round (137th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft, with the intention of playing him at cornerback. As a rookie, he played mostly on special teams and only saw time on defense until the season finale, when he was forced into action because of injuries. He had four special teams tackles in the season. In the fifth game against the Los Angeles Rams, he returned a punt 74 yards for a touchdown and his 128 total punt return yards were third-most in Saints history.

He became the fourth rookie in franchise history to earn Pro Bowl recognition. He also received NFL All-rookie honors as a returner. In 1994, the Saints continued the process of trying to convert him into a cornerback under the tutelage of the secondary assistant coach Jim Mora Jr., with mixed results. It proved to be his best season, as he started in 4 games at right cornerback and one as part of a 6 defensive back set. He recorded 36 tackles (31 solo), 2 interceptions, 7 passes defensed, 2 fumble recoveries and 2 fumbles returned for touchdowns.

It was founded in 2000 by Shaolin monk Shifu Shi Yanzi, and is located in North London, England, between the Tufnell Park and Archway Northern Line tube stations. Shaolin Temple UK is an official emissary of the 1,500-year-old Shaolin Temple in Henan Province in China, by direct mandate from the Abbot Venerable Shi Yong Xin. Classes are taught by Shifu Shi Yanlei and 35th generation disciples: Shi Hengdao, Hengjiu, Hengshang and Hengdi.. http://www.shaolintepleuk.org The school emphasises balanced training both in the external and internal martial arts. Students typically train both in Gong Fu and Qigong.  Gong Fu-Ch'an  Shaolin Temple UK is most well known for Gong Fu (or Kung Fu), and participates in national and international fighting competitions, as well as interclub fights with Muay Thai fighters. Gong Fu classes focus on Sanshou training - one to one hand-to-hand combat - which can be considered to be China's form of kickboxing. This is the style of fighting which the temple's students use in competition. The temple's founder and main teacher Shifu Yanzi was Chinese National Champion for 15 years in the art. Students first train for three months in \\"Preparation\\" class, with a focus on building strength, stamina, flexibility, and learning fundamentals. Beginner level students train without contact. Students are encouraged to try to pass a quarterly grading exam at their first opportunity. Shaolin Temple UK's higher classes are semi-contact and full-contact, students train with gloves and pads, and also spar.  Qigong  There are beginners and advanced Qigong classes. Beginners practice a form (sequence of movements) called Ba Duan Jin, which translates as \\"Eight Pieces of Brocade\\", so called because the form consists of 8 movements. While advanced students will practice body conditioning using bamboo sticks, and an advanced form featuring 12 movements.  Ch'an Buddhism  Ch'an is a branch of Buddhism in which talking in teaching is not encouraged, instead students are encouraged to be sharp and quick learning observers. These qualities are shared with fighters and martial artists. Ch'an Buddhist training involves sitting meditation (Zazen in Japanese) and walking meditation. Although there are also separate Ch'an Meditation classes held, it is also emphasised that Gong Fu training is in fact inseparable from Ch'an Buddhism in its essence and goal.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1969 to 1981, representing the Liberal Party, and served as a minister in the McMahon and Fraser Governments. He later served as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1981 to 1983. Early life Garland was born in 1934 and grew up in Perth, Western Australia. He was educated at Hale School and the University of Western Australia, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Economics. He followed his father into the accounting profession, practising as a chartered accountant from 1958 to 1969. He served as a councillor for the South Ward of the Town of Claremont from 1963 to 1970, finishing as deputy mayor. Confirms his election on 3 May 1963 to the South Ward, succeeding Bill Crommelin. * Confirms his resignation from council, being succeeded at a by-election held on 12 September 1970. He joined the Liberal Party in 1957, and served in several branch and administrative roles. He was the Curtin division president in 1960–1961 and president of the Claremont branch from 1965. At the time of his preselection in 1969, he was senior vice-president of the Liberal Party's Western Australian Division. Politics=Early career When Paul Hasluck resigned from Parliament in 1969 to become Governor-General of Australia, Garland succeeded him as the member for Curtin, a comfortably safe Liberal seat in Perth's wealthy beachside suburbs. Following a cabinet reshuffle in August 1971, Garland was appointed Minister for Supply in the McMahon Government. Aged 37, he became the second-youngest member of the ministry after Andrew Peacock. In March 1972, he was also appointed Minister assisting the Treasurer, in place of Peacock. He retained his positions until the defeat of the government at the 1972 federal election. Notably, as supply minister he authorised the purchase of ten new Westland Sea King helicopters to replace the Westland Wessex as Australia's anti-submarine warfare helicopters. He also unsuccessfully attempted to convince cabinet to purchase Dassault Mirage F1 fighter jets from France, which would have been manufactured in Australia. Garland was named in Billy Snedden's interim opposition executive after the election, but failed to win election to the shadow ministry when a vote was held in January 1973. However, in June 1974 he succeeded Max Fox as Chief Opposition Whip. Fraser Government After the Coalition's victory at the 1975 federal election, Garland was appointed Minister for Post and Telecommunications in the Fraser Government. He was the first person to hold the title, which replaced the earlier position of Postmaster-General. Garland resigned from the ministry on 6 February 1976, when the Commonwealth Police began an investigation into allegations that he had violated the electoral act. He and former senator George Branson were alleged to have paid $500 to cover the electoral expenses of Michael Cavanough, an independent Senate candidate in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), on the condition that he direct his preferences to the Liberal candidate John Knight. The allegations were first publicised by The Canberra Times in the lead-up to the election. Garland and Branson denied that they had engaged in bribery, as they were of the belief that Cavanough had already agreed to give his preferences to Knight. The charges were dismissed at a committal hearing in the Magistrates Court of the Australian Capital Territory on 8 March, with the chief magistrate stating that there was a prima facie case against the pair but that \\"a jury properly directed would not convict the defendants\\". The Canberra Times was critical of the decision to discharge the defendants without a trial, stating that it left doubt as to the legality of their conduct and also deprived them of the vindication of an acquittal. For several months Garland remained a backbencher before being appointed the first Chairman of the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee (1976–1977), Minister for Veterans' Affairs (1977–1978),Fraser's initial choice was Senator Glen Sheil. However, after Sheil publicly professed his support for the South African apartheid regime, which was very much at odds with the Fraser government's position, Fraser decided not to proceed with Sheil's appointment to the Ministry, and his appointment as an Executive Councillor was terminated. Garland was asked to remain as Minister for Veterans' Affairs (as well as his new appointment as Minister for Special Trade Representations) and was appointed in his place. Minister for Special Trade Representations (1978–1979) and Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (1979–1980). Later life Following the November 1980 federal election, Garland resigned from Parliament on 22 January 1981 to accept appointment as Australian High Commissioner in the United Kingdom, a post he held from 1981 to 1983. In 1982, he became a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).

Coupled with the nearby 22-bed Novant Health Medical Park Hospital, Forsyth Medical Center gives Winston- Salem one of the largest, best-equipped hospital facilities in the state. Forsyth Medical Center is accredited by The Joint Commission and is a member of the American Hospital Association. Novant Health Forsyth Medical Center and Novant Health Medical Park Hospital perform close to 40,000 surgical procedures each year, including more than 6,500 general surgery procedures, 7,000 orthopaedic and neurological procedures and 700 open-heart surgeries. Forsyth Medical Center is also active in a number of different clinical areas, including cancer diagnoses, stroke treatments and the delivery of babies.  History  In 1887, women in the then separate towns of Winston and Salem formed a small group and organized the Ladies Twin City Hospital Association to raise funds for the community's first hospital. Within six months, they had used money saved from their household funds to open up a 10-bed hospital inside a home, known as the Grogan House, where patients could be hospitalized for $5 a week. They went to people's homes and community meetings to raise money from anyone who would give them a contribution, and they asked the mayors of both Winston and of Salem to give $12 a month toward the effort. By the early 1890s, the Grogan House was in desperate need of repair. The women increased their fundraising efforts and began to show people in the two towns how their money had been used in the past and described in detail how many people they had helped. They were able to raise $5,000 and open the Twin City Hospital with 12 private rooms, two wards and an operating room. Then, in 1912, after moving to a larger building due to overcrowding and insufficient funding, Winston voters approved bonds for a modern hospital to be constructed in the downtown area of what had become Winston-Salem. The modern City Memorial Hospital on East Fourth Street accepted its first patient in less than two years in 1914. In 1959, voters approved a bond referendum to build a modern hospital on along Silas Creek Parkway. Forsyth Memorial Hospital, which was owned and managed by Forsyth County, opened in 1964, replacing City Memorial Hospital. Twenty years later, in 1984, Carolina Medicorp Inc. (CMI), a non-profit organization, bought the deed for the hospital property from Forsyth County. As part of the transfer agreement, the new organization was required to provide indigent care for citizens of Forsyth County. In 1997, CMI and Presbyterian Healthcare in Charlotte, North Carolina merged to form Novant Health, which currently includes 13 hospitals, six philanthropic foundations, a free-standing emergency department, physician clinics, outpatient surgery and diagnostic centers, rehabilitation programs and community health outreach programs in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, and the national MedQuest organization with 100 diagnostic imaging centers in 10 states. Novant Health is ranked 17th nationally among the 2010 Top 100 Integrated Healthcare Networks, according to an analysis by the SDI health informatics company. On February 11, 2014, Forsyth Medical Center reported to 18 patients who underwent neurosurgery that they may have been exposed to Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease from improperly sterilized surgical instruments. The CDC and hospital officials say that the chances of the patients contracting the disease is rare, since Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease hasn't been contracted from improperly sterilized instruments since 1976.

Manufactured and marketed by Tenix Datagate, the Interactive Link hardware products have been evaluated to the highest level under international security criteria with a strong focus on maintaining the confidentiality of the secure network. The technology underlying the products is drawn from Starlight Technology, developed by the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group.  History  The Interactive Link product suite is a commercialized version of Starlight Technology. This technology, developed as a way to transfer data from a lower classification (Low Side) network to a highly classified (High Side) computer without compromising sensitive information, was formed inside the Australian DSTO as a research project. The technology also allowed users to view and interact on a Low Side network from a High Side computer. The Starlight Technology included a data diode, accompanying server software and Desktop-based equipment. Seen as having commercial merit and after a prototype was developed, the technology was licensed to Vision Abell (later acquired by Tenix) in 1996 for development and supply to Australian government under the brand “Interactive Link”.Australian Defense Minister's Award for Achievement in DSTO Speech, the Hon. John Moore MP, 10 December 1998Transforming Government - Achievements in E-government \\"Securing Systems With Starlight\\", Australian Department of Finance and Administration, 2003 The objective of these products was to increase productivity and to reduce the deskspace required by users working on more than one network, while not compromising the existing security. In 2002, DSTO signed a long-term agreement for the newly formed Tenix Datagate division of Tenix to market, manufacture and further develop the Interactive Link product worldwide. Tenix Datagate subsequently set up offices in the UK and US in addition to their Australian presence. Tenix Defence was acquired by BAE Systems Australia in 2008, including ownership of the Interactive Link products. Due to its high level of certification, the Interactive Link product suite has been deployed to numerous western nations. Products The Interactive Link Product Suite includes the following: The Interactive Link Data Diode Device (IL-DD) - a trusted platform providing a strictly unidirectional data path between two networks. The device allows the transmission of information from Low Side to High Side networks but not vice versa. Data is transmitted by means of optical fibre technology that reduces the risk of data interception by TEMPEST attack. The Interactive Link Keyboard Switch (IL-KBS) – The IL-KBS is a desktop device that allows users of a High Side computer to access a Low Side Thin Client session. Used in conjunction with the IL-DD, no High Side Data is sent down to the Low Side network. Users are able to view and interact with the Low Side inside a window on their High side computer. Interactive Link Multiple Computer Switch (IL-MCS) – a highly secure KVM to switch between two desktop computers of differing security classification levels from a single keyboard, mouse and monitor. Its level of certification (ITSEC E6) means it is the most thoroughly evaluated KVM presently available. Interactive Link Data Pump Applications (IL-DPAs) – These are software applications that send file, email, clipboard and file data over the IL-DD. These may be used independently of the desktop devices. These consist of the File Transfer Application,Email Transfer Application, Clipboard and File Transfer Application and Data Forwarding Application.  Evaluation/certification  High levels of evaluation under relevant security criteria are distinctive features of the Interactive Link hardware. They have been certified under the following criteria: ITSEC – The IL-MCS,IL-MCS entry in the Defence Signals Directorate Evaluated Products List IL-DD IL-DD entry in the Defence Signals Directorate Evaluated Products List and IL-KBS IL-KBS entry in the Defence Signals Directorate Evaluated Products List have all been evaluated to the level of E6 under ITSEC, the highest level possible under this criteria. This evaluation was performed under the Australian Information Security Evaluation Programme,Defence Signals Directorate Information Security Evaluation and mutually recognised in a large number of nations. Common Criteria – The IL-DD has been certified to EAL7 under the Common Criteria in the United States, the highest level possible. IL-DD Entry in the US Common Criteria Validated Products List The IL-KBS has been certified to EAL5.  Potential uses of interactive link products  The IL-KBS and IL-MCS units are used primarily where users need to access two separate networks from a single desktop while maintaining strict security separation between the two domains. Examples of this would include accessing Classified and Unclassified networks in a military setting. The IL-DD and IL-DPAs are versatile in their applicability, primarily they are used where data in various forms needs to be sent in a strictly unidirectional manner. This could include automated sending internet data to an otherwise isolated network, a unidirectional email gateway and one-way dispatch of log files for secure storage. Another potential setting is where the IL-DD is \\"turned around\\" to push data from a secure source to an insecure destination.

Early life Olga Breeskin was born in Mexico City. She is the daughter of Russian violinist and conductor Elias Breeskin. She and her brother as children learned to play the violin from their father. When Breeskin was 13 years old; she and her brother were forced to support the family and began to play their violins for tips in restaurants. Breeskin later confessed that she kept some of the tip money for herself by hiding it in her shoe.

The route went from Osaka through the Seto Inland Sea and the Kanmon Straits to ports in Hokuriku on the Sea of Japan and later to Hokkaidō. Kaga Domain, which sold about 70,000 koku of rice every year in Osaka, succeeded in sending 100 koku by boat through this route in 1639. The Tokugawa shogunate also received rice from Dewa Province through merchant Kawamura Zuiken in 1672, but it is thought to be a response from these ships. Japanese ships at the time normally could make only one trip per year, but with the arrival of Western schooners in the Meiji era, ships were able to make up to four trips annually. The Meiji Restoration also brought the end of the feudal system and the introduction of the telegraph, removing gaps between regional markets and making it difficult for the shipping routes to make large profits. The national construction of railroads further led to the end of the kitamaebune.

He continued to play well for the team in a lower-order position, despite Somerset finishing 2006 dead last in Division Two of the County Championship. Spurway remained in the team for the start of the 2007 season, as the team were enjoying a current upturn in their fortunes. The lower-order batsman, who was the preferred wicket-keeper over team-mate Carl Gazzard, continued to pull in impressive performances in the lower-order, none more so than when he was halted in the middle of a run towards his first half-century on 44* in a record-setting Somerset innings of 850-7 declared in April 2007. However, Craig Kieswetter became Somerset's first-choice wicketkeeper after some impressive performances in the one-day side. The club now maintains a policy to have only two wicketkeepers in their squad, which meant that Kieswetter and Gazzard were retained, at the expense of Spurway.

By June 22 it was still forming near Kamenka in the Kiev Military District and its order of battle was as follows: * 685th Rifle Regiment * 883rd Rifle Regiment * 895th Rifle Regiment * 384th Light Artillery Regiment * 393rd Howitzer Regiment * 50th Antitank Battalion * 4th Sapper BattalionNiehorster: Soviet Rifle Divisions Nos.150-199, accessed February 2008Charles S. Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed Before June 1942, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. VIII, Nafziger, 1996, p 93 The division, commanded by Colonel A.K. Berestov, joined with the 195th and 200th Rifle Divisions to form the 31st Rifle Corps. At the onset of the German invasion this corps was under direct command of the Kiev Special Military District, soon renamed Southwestern Front, and was positioned in the second echelon southeast of Sarny.Artem Drabkin and Alexei Isaev, Barbarossa Through Soviet Eyes, trans. C. Summerville, Pen & Sword Books, Ltd., Barnsley, UK, 2012, pp xiii, 178 On June 28 the Corps was assigned to 5th Army and the 193rd went into battle at Rozhits and Kivertsy. By July 8 it was down to 3,500 men and less than 35 guns and mortars of all types. On August 19, as 5th Army began its retreat, the division had only 600 men remaining; the following week it took in reservists and volunteers to a total of 4,500 men, but was almost completely lacking heavy weapons. In September the 193rd was surrounded with 5th Army in the Kiev Pocket and destroyed. The division's number was officially stricken from the Soviet order of battle on Dec. 27.Sharp, \\"Red Legions\\", p 93  2nd Formation  The division was reformed at Sorochinsk, in the South Urals Military District, from December 1941 to 3 January 1942. It comprised: * 685th Rifle Regiment * 883rd Rifle Regiment * 895th Rifle Regiment * 384th Artillery Regiment * 50th Antitank Battalion * 4th Sapper Battalion * 320th Reconnaissance Company.Charles C. Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p 75. Note that Sharp misnumbers two of the rifle regiments, although he gives them correctly in \\"Red Legions\\". They are also given as stated here in other sources such as Smekhotvorov and Chuikov. In June the division went to the Voronezh Front reserves, but was still far from complete at that time. Stalingrad Monument to Mikhail Panikakha in Volgograd. On 17 September the division, commanded by Col. F. N. Smekhotvorov, was assigned to the 62nd Army and fought during the Battle of Stalingrad. On 22 Sept., the 685th Regiment was ferried from the east to the west bank of the Volga into central Stalingrad and five nights later, on the 27th, the other two regiments joined it. The 883rd and 895th were deployed in the Red October factory complex. The following day, the 883rd was attacked by German tanks. Anti-tank rifleman Mikhail Panikakha was attempting to defend his position with Molotov cocktails. A German bullet ignited one of his bombs, setting him alight. He then threw himself against a tank with his remaining bomb and destroyed it, at the cost of his own life. Panikakha was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union in 1990. The division was mauled and pushed back in a fierce German attack on 1 Oct. A day later, it was defending the western part of the Red October Factory, which included the kitchens, the bath house and workers' flats; it also counter-attacked Hill 107.5.Chuikov, 1963; Fowler, 2005 The regiments, down to 200 men, were unequal to the task and were pushed back by German tanks and infantry. Chuikov, writing in 1963, said that between 13 and 20 Nov. the survivors of the 193rd Rifle Division (Smekhotvorov)Smekhotvorov's account can be read at http://rkka193rdrifles.homestead.com/193rdHistory.html were consolidated into the 685th Rifle Regiment - the grand total was 250 soldiers.Chuikov, V. I. (1963). The Beginning of the Road: The story for the Battle for Stalingrad (Macgibbon and Kee) However the historian John Erickson says that by 11 Nov. the division was reduced to 1,000 personnel.John Erickson (historian), The Road to Stalingrad, Cassel Military Paperbacks, 2004, p.460-1 At 2300 hrs. on November 12, Col. Smekhotvorov received orders from Maj. Gen. N.I. Krylov, chief-of-staff of 62nd Army, to withdraw his divisional headquarters and those of its subordinate regiments to the east bank of the Volga. The composite regiment was subordinated to the 138th Rifle Division, and the divisional artillery likewise to the chief of 62nd Army's artillery. This order officially ended the division's participation in the battle.David M. Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 660. Glantz states that the composite regiment numbered 289 men on this date. Kursk The rebuilding division was assigned to the 65th Army (former 4th Tank Army) in February 1943; it was under the command of Lieutenant General Pavel Batov, part of Colonel General K. K. Rokossovski's Central Front. The 193rd would remain under these commanders for the duration of the war.Sharp, p 75 The Front was redeployed to the Kursk area, where the division, now with a strength of 9,000 troops,Glantz, David M., After Stalingrad, The Red Army's Winter Offensive 1942 - 1943, Helion and Co., 2009, p 285 made gains in a gap between the German 2nd Army and 2nd Panzer Army until German reserves brought the advance to a halt.Glantz, p 314 The 193rd remained in the Kursk salient through the following months, including Operation Zitadelle. At this time the division was part of the 27th Rifle Corps, and was commanded by Major General F. N. Zhobrev. Zhobrev was replaced by Colonel A. G. Frolenkov on Aug. 28. p 21 Frolenkov was eventually promoted to Maj. Gen. and named a Hero of the Soviet Union;Litvin, Nikolai, 800 Days on the Eastern Front, University Press of Kansas, 2007, p 104 he remained in command for the rest of the war. After the German defeat at Kursk, the Red Army launched its first summer offensive. The 193rd staged a successful assault crossing of the Dnepr River on October 15, with divisional and army artillery firing 1,000 shells per minute in support. For this action the division was awarded the honorific title Dnepr. In February, 1944 the division received 1,700 replacements from the 218th Reserve Rifle Regiment,Sharp, p 76 but remained well understrength for some time. The 193rd was joined with the 354th Rifle Division in April to form the 105th Rifle Corps, commanded by General D. F. Alekseev, where it would remain for the duration of the war. Advance As part of Rokossovski's 1st Belorussian Front, the 193rd took part in Operation Bagration, also known as the Destruction of Army Group Centre. The 193rd assisted the 354th in liberating the city of Bobruisk from the German 9th Army on 29 June 1944, and on 8 July was credited with liberating the city of Baranovichi. Racing ahead, forward detachments of the division penetrated the Bialowiecz Forest, and onwards to the Western Bug River where it was temporarily halted in late July by counterattacks by the 5th SS Panzer Division (Wiking).Litvin, p 85 Continuing to advance, the depleted 65th Army managed to carve out a bridgehead over the Narev River, north of Warsaw between Serotsk and Pultusk, on 5 September.Litvin, pp 90-91 This bridgehead was subjected to a major surprise counterattack by German forces on 5 October, but the 193rd was successful in helping to narrowly hold it.Litvin, pp 94-99 During the next three months the division was brought up to strength again, and on 14 January 1945 participated in the massive breakout of the now-renumbered 2nd Belorussian Front from the bridgehead.Litvin, pp 113-14 The 193rd reached the Vistula River on 26 January, and participated in the liberation of Danzig (Gdańsk) at the end of March.Litvin, p 132 In a final series of operations, the division advanced to the Oder River and helped stage an assault crossing beginning on 20 April near Stettin. The city officials surrendered to the 193rd at dawn on 26 April.Litvin, pp 138-39 Division honorifics were - Russian: Днепровская краснознаменная, орденов Ленина, Суворова, Кутузова. (English: Dnepr, Red Banner, Order of Lenin, Order of Suvorov, Order of Kutuzov.)  Cold War service  By 1955 the division was reflagged as the 22nd Mechanized Division, and in 1957 was reflagged again as the 36th Tank Division. The division was restored to its World War II number - the 193rd Tank Division, on 11 January 1965 4.Michael Holm, 193rd Tank Division, 2015. In 1991-2 the 193rd Tank Division incorporated the 251st, 262nd, 264th Tank, 297th Motor Rifle, 852nd Artillery (Self-propelled), 929th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiments, 52nd Reconnaissance Battalion, and other non-combat units. The 193rd Tank Division was stationed at Bobruisk (Киселевичи \\"Бобруйск-25\\", Kiselevichi) in the Belarussian Military District with the 5th Guards Tank Army. In 1991 it became the 193rd Base for Storage of Weapons & Equipment (although the number needs confirmation); it came under the Armed Forces of Belarus in March 1992. It was disbanded some years later.

Interwar period  The division traced its history back to the formation of the 82nd Territorial Rifle Division in 1932 from personnel of the 57th Rifle Division's 169th Rifle Regiment, which had relocated to the Transbaikal region. Formed in the Perm area, the 82nd relocated to the Ural Military District in May 1935. In May 1939, the 82nd Rifle was mobilized and sent to the Transbaikal. From July, it fought in the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against Japanese troops. After the end of the fighting, the 82nd was stationed at Bayantümen. For their actions, the 601st Rifle and 82nd Artillery Regiments of the division were awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 17 November. By a directive of the People's Commissariat of Defense of 15 January 1940, the division was converted into the 82nd Motor Rifle Division with 12,000 men. Its 82nd Red Banner Artillery Regiment was formed from the 82nd Red Banner Howitzer Artillery Regiment and the 82nd Light Artillery Regiment. It included the 210th, 289th, and 601st Motor Rifle Regiments in addition to the artillery regiment. Then-Colonel Ivan Fedyuninsky commanded the division before the war. On 1 November 1940, the division included 11,755 men and 240 BT tanks. In March 1941, the 82nd was converted into the 82nd Motorized Division, joining the 29th Mechanized Corps. It included the 210th and 601st Motorized Regiments as well as the 123rd Tank and 82nd Artillery Regiments. However, this assignment proved to be brief, as the corps disbanded in May and the division became a separate unit of the 17th Army. On 1 June, it included 200 BT and T-26 tanks and seventeen T-37, T-38, and T-40 amphibious tanks for a total of 217 tanks.  World War II  In July and August, the division was reorganized into the 82nd Motor Rifle Division again. Its 123rd Tank Regiment was used to form the 111th Tank Division, leaving the 82nd with the 210th, 250th, and 601st Motor Rifle Regiments and the 82nd Artillery Regiment. As a result of German advances following the beginning of their invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, on 22 June, the 82nd was sent to the Western Front in October. It departed the Far East on 7 October and arrived at the front on 25 October. It was reinforced with the 27th Separate Tank Battalion, and fought in the Battle of Moscow as part of the 5th Army. The 82nd fought in fighting at Dorokhovo and in the capture of Mozhaysk. For its actions, the division was made an elite Guards unit, the 3rd Guards Motor Rifle Division, on 17 March 1942, and received the Order of the Red Banner. It took part in the summer battles of 1942 with the Western Front and the failed Operation Mars in November/December 1942. After moving back into Stavka Reserves in June 1943, it was reorganized into the 6th Guards Mechanized Corps on 28 June 1943, being merged with the 49th Mechanised Brigade. The new Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Akimov, became part of the 4th Tank Army under Lieutenant General Vasily Badanov. Its first action was at Orel, the counterattack (Operation Kutuzov) on the northern side of the Kursk bulge after the German defeat at the Battle of Kursk proper. John Erickson writes that '..at 1100 on 26 July, two of Badanov's corps (11th Tank and 6th Guards Mechanised) put in a ragged attack towards Bolkhov. For the next few hours, under the very gaze of Bagramyan [commander of 11th Guards Army, whose sector 4th Tank was attacking through] and Badanov, both corps were heavily battered by the concealed German tanks and assault guns.'John Erickson, 'Road to Berlin,' 1982, p.115 For the remainder of 1943, it was in reserve. It took part in the winter battles in the Ukraine in 1944 (Proskurov-Chernovitsy), then the Lvov-Sanodmierz Operation in the summer. It then participated in the Lower Silesia, Upper Silesia, Berlin, and Prague operations. In August 1944 it was given the honorific 'Lvov' for its part in the liberation of that city.  Cold War  The Corps then became the 6th Guards Mechanised Division (1945–57) and then 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division (17 May 1957 – 1982, GSFG). The division was based at Bernau and was part of the 20th Guards Army. In May 1958, the division was reorganized. The 930th Guards Artillery Regiment moved to the 11th Guards Motor Rifle Division and was replaced by the 400th Artillery Regiment. The 1106th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment and 22nd Separate Guards Sapper Battalion were also transferred to the 11th Guards and replaced by that division's 288th Guards Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment and 122nd Separate Guards Sapper Battalion. The 351st Separate Missile Battalion was activated in 1961. On 19 February 1962, the 32nd Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion was activated. In May, the 10th Separate Tank Battalion was formed. The 122nd Separate Guards Sapper Battalion became an engineer-sapper battalion in 1968 and the 465th Separate Anti-Tank Artillery Battalion was activated. The chemical defence company became the 120th Separate Chemical Defence Battalion in 1972. The 686th Separate Motor Transport Battalion became the 1122nd Separate Material Supply Battalion in 1980. Troops of the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division on parade in Bernau, 1985 On 8 February 1985, the 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division became the 90th Guards Tank Division. A new 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division was formed from the previous 90th Guards Tank Division in Poland. The new 90th Guards Tank Division's 16th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment became the 6th Guards Tank Regiment. Its 82nd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment was transferred to the new 6th Guards in Poland and replaced by that division's 215th Guards Tank Regiment. The 10th Separate Tank Battalion was disbanded, and the 465th Separate Anti- Tank Artillery Battalion transferred to the new 6th Guards. On 28 August 1988, the 351st Separate Missile Battalion was transferred to the 464th Missile Brigade. On 1 July 1989, the 215th Guards Tank Regiment was moved to the 25th Tank Division and replaced by that division's 803rd Motor Rifle Regiment. During its last years in Germany the Division consisted of the 6th and 68th Guards Tank Regiments, the 81st Guards Motor Rifle Regiment, and the 803rd Motor Rifle Regiment . Also part of the Division were the 400th SP Artillery Regiment, the 288th Air defence Missile Regiment, and smaller supporting units. In January 1991, the 803rd Motor Rifle Regiment transferred back to the Soviet Union and was replaced by the 35th Motor Rifle Division's 69th Motor Rifle Regiment. The division became part of the 2nd Guards Tank Army in May.  Russian service  In August 1992, the division moved to Chernorechye (now Roshchinsky) in Samara Oblast, becoming part of the Volga Military District, declining to a very low strength. In 1993, the 69th Motor Rifle Regiment became the 169th Tank Regiment. Between December 1993 and May 1998, the division was part of the 2nd Guards Army. Between 14 December 1994 and 9 April 1995 the 81st Guards Motor Rifle Regiment fought in the First Chechen War. In December 1997, the division became the 5968th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base. The 81st Guards Motor Rifle Regiment was sent to the 27th Guards Motor Rifle Division.

This triptych once hung in the Church of San Lorenzo, Florence. The four saints may represent (from left to right) St. Amata, St. Concordia, St. Andrew, and Pope St. Mark, each of whose relics are in San Lorenzo. Jacopo di Cione (c. 1325 – after 1390) was an Italian Gothic period painter in the Republic of Florence. Life and career Born in Florence between 1320 and 1330, he is closely associated with his three older brothers Andrea di Cione di Arcangelo (called Orcagna), Nardo di Cione and Matteo di Cione. The di Cione (pronounced dee choh’ nay) brothers often worked collaboratively. Jacopo lived in the popolo Sancte Marie Novelle and, later in life, in the popolo Sancti Laurentii. In 1366–68 Jacopo worked on a large chamber in the guildhall of the judges and notaries, Florence (a surviving altarpiece with Crucifixion is in the National Gallery, London). After Andrea's death in 1368 Jacopo took over some of his brother's commissions, for example guaranteeing to complete a painting of the Virgin and assuming responsibility for the altarpiece of St Matthew, both for the Orsanmichele, Florence. He enrolled in the Arte dei Medici e Speziali in 1369, and was one of the consuls of the guild in 1384, 1387 and 1392. Jacopo also worked regularly with the painter Niccolò di Pietro Gerini. In 1370–71 they produced the polyptych for the high altar of the church of San Pier Maggiore, Florence. Niccolò was paid for the overall design, while Jacopo seems to have been responsible for the narratives. The altarpiece is one of the largest commissioned in fourteenth-century Florence, and was probably commissioned by the Albizzi family. The twelve main panels of the altarpiece are in the National Gallery, London, but the predella showing scenes from the life of Saint Peter has been dispersed. The two painters again collaborated in 1372–73 on the large panel of the Coronation of the Virgin commissioned by the mint of Florence, and in 1386 they received the commission for a fresco of the Annunciation for the council chamber in the Palazzo dei Priori, Volterra. Between 1378 and 1380 Jacopo worked in the Florence Cathedral – he is recorded as Matteo guarantor – and continued to procure marble for the cathedral workshop after his brother's death. Later Jacopo probably also executed gilding decoration for twelve marble statues for the jamb of the main porch, and completed other work in the cathedral. In 1382 and 1385 Jacopo is recorded working at the Loggia dei Priori, Florence, and in 1386 he provided four panel paintings to the Avignon office of the merchant Francesco di Marco Datini from Prato. In 1391 Jacopo painted the altar for the Church of San Lorenzo in Florence (now in the Honolulu Museum of Art). He died in Florence, after 2 May 1398 and before 1400.

Biography Berthiaume was born in Laval, Quebec, on May 9, 1931. He died of cancer (June 23, 2009) in Montreal (Québec) after being hospitalized for 10 days. He studied piano and saxophone at College Laval. In 1948, he created an instrumental group named The Three Bars. The owner of the bar in which they performed suggested they select a vocalist, knowing that a singer would make the group more popular. Berthiaume was chosen, and became the group's vocalist. The move seemed to work, and the group was soon hailed as the best in the city. They played in the high-class nightclub El Morocco, where Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, and Vic Damone had all performed. In 1954, the music label RCA Victor signed the trio, and they performed the Italian hit N'oublie Jamais (Never Forget), in French. This became a hit for the group, selling nearly 40,000 copies Despite the fame, Berthiaume preferred to spend time in recording studios then on stage. In 1956, Berthiaume began to record music for advertising, notably Sweet Caporal cigarettes. On the back of this performance, he was in high demand to perform in commercials for other companies.

The design was first proposed in 1986 and subsequently described by Gray and Wheatley as a method for obtaining unbiased estimates of the effects of a putative causal variable without conducting a traditional randomised trial. These authors also coined the term Mendelian randomization. The design has a powerful control for reverse causation and confounding, which often impede or mislead epidemiological studies. Motivation An important focus of observational epidemiology is to identify modifiable causes of diseases of public health concern. In order to have firm evidence that some prospective intervention will have the desired beneficial effect on public health, the association observed between the particular risk factor and disease must imply that the risk factor either aggravates or actually causes the disease. Well-known successes include the identified causal links between smoking and lung cancer, and between blood pressure and stroke. However, there have also been notable failures when identified exposures were later shown by randomised controlled trials to be non-causal. For instance, it was previously thought that hormone replacement would prevent cardiovascular disease, but it is now known to have no such benefit and may even adversely affect health. Spurious findings in observational epidemiology are most likely caused by social, behavioural, or physiological confounding factors, which are particularly difficult to measure accurately and difficult to control for. Moreover, many epidemiological findings cannot be ethically replicated in clinical trials. Randomization approach > “Genetics is indeed in a peculiarly favoured condition in that Providence > has shielded the geneticist from many of the difficulties of a reliably > controlled comparison. The different genotypes possible from the same mating > have been beautifully randomised by the meiotic process. A more perfect > control of conditions is scarcely possible, than that of different genotypes > appearing in the same litter.” — R.A. Fisher Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method that allows one to test for, or in certain cases to estimate, a causal effect from observational data in the presence of confounding factors. It uses common genetic polymorphisms with well-understood effects on exposure patterns (e.g., propensity to drink alcohol) or effects that mimic those produced by modifiable exposures (e.g., raised blood cholesterol). Importantly, the genotype must only affect the disease status indirectly via its effect on the exposure of interest. Because genotypes are assigned randomly when passed from parents to offspring during meiosis, if we assume that mate choice is not associated with genotype (panmixia), then the population genotype distribution should be unrelated to the confounding factors that typically plague observational epidemiology studies. In this regard, Mendelian randomization can be thought of as a “naturally” randomized controlled trial. Because the polymorphism is the instrument, Mendelian randomization is dependent on prior genetic association studies having provided good candidate genes for response to risk exposure. Statistical analysis From a statistical perspective, Mendelian randomization (MR) is an application of the technique of instrumental variables with genotype acting as an instrument for the exposure of interest. The method has also been used in economic research studying the effects of obesity on earnings, and other labor market outcomes. Accuracy of MR depends on a number of assumptions: That there is no direct relationship between the instrumental variable and the dependent variables, and that there are no direct relations between the instrumental variable and any possible confounding variables. In addition to being misled by direct effects of the instrument on the disease, the analyst may also be misled by linkage disequilibrium with unmeasured directly-causal variants, genetic heterogeneity, pleiotropy (often detected as a genetic correlation), or population stratification. Mendelian randomization is widely used in analyzing data of the large-scale Genome-wide association study, which usually adopts a case-control design. The conventional assumptions for instrumental variables under a case-control design are instead made in the population of controls. Ignoring the ascertainment bias of a case-control study when performing a Mendelian randomization can suffer from a considerable bias in the causal effect estimation.

He has played 25 games and scored three goals for the Denmark national under-21 football team. Biography Born in Ebeltoft, Peter Degn started his career for local amateur team Ebeltoft IF in 1994. In 1996, he moved to Aarhus Gymnastik Forening (AGF) in the top-flight Danish Superliga championship. He got his national breakthrough in the 1996 Danish Cup final, when he scored the first goal in the 2–0 win against Brøndby IF. He was subsequently called up for the Danish national youth selections, and played a total 26 youth national games until December 1999. In February 1999, Degn was bought by English club Everton in the top-flight FA Premier League. Never a success at Everton, he played four league games as a substitute in his two-and-a-half seasons at the club. He was loaned out to his former club AGF in October 2000, but even though AGF wanted to sign a permanent transfer deal with Degn, they could not agree on the price with Everton. In July 2001, Degn moved back to Denmark, when he signed a four-year contract with Superliga team Brøndby IF. Out of form, Degn did not find much playing time at Brøndby either. He was loaned out to Vejle Boldklub in the secondary Danish 1st Division in the fall 2002. He made his debut in September 2002, and quickly secured a place in Vejle's starting line-up. At the end of the season, Brøndby showed no interest in using Degn. He was loaned out to Vejle yet again, where he was named team captain. Having played little more than a year at Vejle, he moved back to the top-flight Superliga in January 2004, when he was bought by Silkeborg IF. These days Peter is still a little active in football, now playing for his childhood club, Ebeltoft I.F. in his spare time. He is also now the owner of a pub in Ebeltoft.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Rudy Larriva. The short was released on February 19, 1966, and stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. Plot Wile E. tries to capture the Road Runner by covering the road with tar, but the bird simply runs directly over it. He stops himself from leaping into the tar (in anticipation of the Road Runner being stuck), and accidentally walks into the road where the tar is located to ascertain where his enemy has gone. Wile E. manages to free himself from the tar pit, but is now stuck in the bucket of tar. The coyote hops across the road, stuck in the bucket, until he has to outrun a truck coming from that direction. Ultimately, he fails to do so when he gets himself stuck in the tar pit a second time, and then gets flattened. Hoping to get the Road Runner to run into it, Wile E. places a mirror on a curve on the very edge of a mountain, but soon discovers that his reflection is mocking him. To figure out where the \\"reflection\\" is coming from, the coyote snakes around the mirror to the side and discovers nothing there. Puzzled, the coyote retracts his neck, and soon suffers gravity due to his location in thin air. But in the dump where he falls is an inspiration: Wile E. scavenges a wealth of spare parts and takes them offscreen where construction noises are heard. Road Runner is left curious as to what his opponent is doing and curiously looks around the rock Wile is working behind. However, curiosity quickly turns to outright terror when Wile E. unveils his creation: a blue robotic coyote at least five times as tall as himself. Using a dial-operated remote control, Wile E. gives the robot the following commands (with electric bolts coming out of robot's ears before executing each command): WALK: The robot does so, but will not stop or change direction to avoid smashing his creator. Therefore... STOP/HALT: However, the robot fails to stop, crushing Wile E. underfoot. LOWER HAND for Wile E. to climb on, then LIFT HAND for him to get a bird's eye-view of the landscape. HUNT: Robot gets \\"on his mark\\" and \\"set\\", hears the Road Runner coming, and starts chasing him as he passes by (a rendition of \\"Charge\\" is played every time the robot begins the chase). The Road Runner is uncharacteristically shocked at the sight of his enemy on the robot, and Wile E. is soon in striking distance to issue STRIKE. The robot turns his hand around (unfortunately for Wile E., it is the one he is standing on) and attempts to crush the Road Runner, but misses each time and ends up flattening the Coyote like a pancake. Standing between the robot's ears, Wile E. hears the Road Runner coming and orders the robot to ATTACK, but the electric bolts from its ears burn him to a crisp. Wile E. adds fangs to the robot's mouth, gives the order to HUNT, and the chase is on again. This time, the robot miraculously succeeds in catching the Road Runner. However, Wile E. fails to recognize the sensitive personality of his creation. He enters the command to EAT, but when this fails to prompt the robot, he fine-tunes one of the knobs to add the word STUPID. The robot promptly opens its mouth and throws Wile E. inside, giving the Road Runner a chance to escape. Crawling out of one of the robot's ears, and obviously irked, Wile E. flatly commands ONE MORE TRY, YOU IDIOT! Again, the robot starts after Road Runner, who is now standing on the other side of a collapsed road. Horrified, Wile E. tries vainly to stop the robot (TURN, STOP, HALT, BACK, WHOA, REVERSE, HEEL), but all commands go unanswered and both he and the robot fall into the chasm, destroying the robot upon impact with the ground and leaving Wile E. in the same heap of junk that he started with. Notes The Solid Tin Coyote breaks several of the conventions of the Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote series. Whereas most of the films in the series focus on a series of rapid-fire gags, the majority of this film is focused on one: the construction and use of the titular solid tin coyote. Furthermore, this is the only film in the series in which the Road Runner shows any form of alarm at Wile E. Coyote's schemes. It also is unique in that Wile E. Coyote successfully, if only temporarily, captures the Road Runner; however, in keeping with the spirit of the series, he does not succeed in eating him, and the Road Runner escapes unharmed.

Its name Bubungan Tinggi refers to the steep roof (45 degrees). In the old kingdom time, this house was the core building within a palace complex, where the King and his family resided. Since 1850, there were various buildings added around it with their own respective functions. Later this type of house became so popular, that people which were not part of the royalty also took interest in building it. Today, there are houses of this type of architecture all over South Kalimantan, and even crossing the borders of Central Kalimantan and East Kalimantan. Due to ancient ties between this region and the island of Madagascar a similar style can be observed in some parts of that island. As it is more expensive than a usual house, it is only affordable for the more wealthy people. Construction Elements The main construction elements of the Rumah Bubungan Tinggi are: * The main building part in the middle. * Anjung, the constructions on the right (Anjung Kanan) and the left side (Anjung Kiwa) of the central part. * The central part of the roof that is very steep, the Bubungan Tinggi. * Front roof is Sindang Langit, rear roof is called Hambin Awan. Rooms * Palatar, the front room which is the first room someone would encounter after climbing the stairs * Panampik Kacil, a small room after someone enters Lawang Hadapan (front door). The floor is higher than Palatar. This floor border is called Watun Sambutan. * Panampik Tangah, a bigger room than Panampik Kacil, with a higher floor. The floor border is called Watun Jajakan. * Panampik Basar or Ambin Sayup, the in oppose of the Tawing Halat (middle wall), with an even higher floor. The floor border is called the same thing with the Panampik Tangah, Watun Jajakan. * Palidangan or Ambin Dalam, the inner part of the house which borders the Panampik Basar. The floor is the same height with Panampik Basar (but in some houses, the floor of Panampik Basar is lower than Palidangan’s). The border is called Watun Langkahan. In this room is the large pillars that hold the Bubungan Tinggi (there are 8 of them). These pillars are called Tihang Pitugur or Tihang Guru. * Panampik Dalam or Panampik Bawah is a quite large room with floor lower than Palidangan’s and has the same height with Panampik Tangah. The border of this floor is called Watun Jajakan. * Padapuran or Padu, the last room in the rear. The floor is lower than Panampik Bawah. The floor border is called Watun Juntaian. This part of the house is used for kitchening. Atangan part is the part for cooking, Salaian part is for drying the woods use for cooking, Pajijiban and Pagaduran are the parts for dishwashing and laundrying. Ornaments Carvings decorate fundamental parts such as the pillars, the stair railings, etc. Banjarese-style decoration are strongly influenced by Islam which forbids the depiction of human or animal. So the common motives are floral. There are motives that incorporates features of naga and other mystical animals, but they are stylized in a way of floral form. Contemporary Use Nowadays most Banjar people have little interest in building Bubungan Tinggi. Beside the fact that it is expensive to build, people prefer the \\"modern\\" type of house. Its cultural values, however, are still appreciated. It is the main figure in both South Kalimantan and Banjarmasin's coat of arms. Many of the modern governmental buildings are built with its traits.

Burrows was born in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He is first recorded as turning out for Holbeck in 1877, when like many of his team he was bowled by W. G. Grace. He played for Holbeck again in 1878. In 1880, he made his debut for the Yorkshire side against Middlesex, when he opened the batting in the first innings. After making four runs, he moved down the order in the second innings, when he made his highest score of 23. He played five more matches for Yorkshire in the season, but his only game for the club in 1881 was not of first-class status. In the 1884 season, Burrows played one match for Derbyshire against Surrey. In seven first-class matches he scored 95 runs at 7.91, with a best of 23. He bowled 10 balls of round arm fast medium without success.Matthew Burrows at Cricket Archive Burrows died in Beeston, Leeds aged 37.

Minneapolis, Minnesota, June 12, 1892; d. Albuquerque, New Mexico, January 6, 1989) was an American composer, ethnomusicologist, arts administrator, and attorney from New Mexico. Biography=Early life A symphony concert in his hometown of Minneapolis when he was a pre-teen planted the seed for Robb's lifelong desire to be a composer. He began studying cello, and then pipe organ. While pursuing an undergraduate degree in English literature at Yale University, Robb continued his music education, including a course taught by Horatio Parker. Despite his passion for music, Robb turned to a career in the law. He attended both the University of Minnesota Law School and Harvard Law School . Robb worked as an international bond lawyer in New York City, but always made time for his music aspirations. During a 1935–36 leave of absence from his law firm, he studied composition with Nadia Boulanger at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France. It was her encouragement that gave him the confidence to pursue his dream of being a composer. Throughout his life, he made time to study composition; his teachers included Horatio Parker, Darius Milhaud, Roy Harris, Paul Hindemith, and Nadia Boulanger (; ; ). The educator In 1941, after 18 years as a lawyer, Robb left his successful New York law practice to become a professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of his first achievements was to establish the University of New Mexico Symphony Orchestra, which continued to thrive in 2013. He played a major role in building the college's Department of Music. Among the many composition students he influenced are Halim El-Dabh and John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet Robb served as Dean of the university's College of Fine Arts from 1942 to 1957 . He became known as Dean Robb, a title that stayed with him for the rest of his life. In 1986, he received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the University of New Mexico . The folk-song collector Not long after arriving in New Mexico, Robb became enamored of the Hispanic and indigenous cultures, in particular their distinctive music. On many weekends, he and his wife, Harriet, would hop in their car and head to the rural communities that dotted the state. Sometimes Robb had appointments set up, but other times, they just happened upon community gatherings. With permission of the performers, Robb would pull out his Wollensak wire recorder, hook it up to his car battery and record the musicians' impromptu performances. \\"From the offices in the UNM Music Department to the dance hall across the street from the Rainbow Bar in Cuba, New Mexico, Robb recorded anyone who was willing to spend the time singing and playing for him\\" . This effort would ultimately result in nearly 3,000 field recordings of traditional music from the American Southwest, Nepal, and South America, which form the core of the John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music at the University of New Mexico . The composer In addition to a commitment to preserve traditional songs and song forms that might otherwise be lost, Robb turned to those songs as inspiration for his own compositions. His regional opera, Little Jo, written in 1947–48, best shows how Robb drew from Hispanic folk music in his compositions. Another ambitious work, Joy Comes to Deadhorse, also illustrates Robb's fascination with his adopted home. The musical was set on two adjoining ranches in the Southwest, and centers around an Anglo boy and an Hispanic girl who fall in love with each other, despite the machinations to the contrary of their fathers. The play did not receive the national attention Robb had hoped for, and he turned to Tom Jones, a young unknown lyricist, who showed interest. After years of unsuccessful collaboration, Robb agreed to relinquish his rights to the work to Jones, who reworked it with Harvey Schmidt into a non- Hispanic version. The result was The Fantasticks, which ran for 42 years at the Sullivan Theater in New York for a total of 17,162 performances . Robb composed a large body of music, including two operas, symphonic and chamber music, and electronic music . His orchestral works have been played by many major orchestras in the United States and abroad under conductors, such as Hans Lange, Maurice Bonney, Maurice Abravanel, Leonard Slatkin, Gilberto Orellano, Yoshimi Takeda, Guillermo Figueroa, James Richards and Franz Vote . The electronic music pioneer Robb was in his 70s when he discovered an entirely new medium for his musical compositions. In the summer of 1965 he attended a seminar hosted by Robert Moog in upstate New York to learn more about a revolutionary new instrument, which came to be known as the Moog synthesizer. Shortly thereafter he became one of the first to purchase the synthesizer and set about to create a new body of electronic music. In all, Robb composed more than 65 electronic works . At a 1969 concert, he collaborated with the Albuquerque Symphony Orchestra to present \\"Transmutation for Orchestra and Electronic Instrument\\", one of his compositions that involved both the Moog synthesizer and an orchestra. A selection of his electronic works was presented at a 1969 international music festival in Trieste, Italy. As a pioneer in this new medium, he spoke at conferences around the world. In 2012, Robb was recognized as one of 12 pioneers of electronic music featured in the Moog Foundation's 2012 wall calendar . Robb died in 1989 at the age of 97, within 10 days of the death of his beloved wife, Harriet. They had been married for 68 years . He was active as a composer well into his 90s and completed his Requiem, which was his last major composition, when he was 93. The archives Four distinct collections make up the John Donald Robb Archives in the UNM University Libraries' Center for Southwest Research. They are the John Donald Robb Field Recordings, which can be listened to online; the John Donald Robb Photograph Collection, the John Donald Robb Papers, which include original Robb's original music manuscripts, and the John Donald Robb Musical Trust Records. Also included in the archives are collections preserved by Robb's associates. This list includes Hispanic music, Native American chants, music from South America and Europe, and oral histories . Publications In 1954, Robb published Hispanic Folk Songs of New Mexico (UNM Press), a book that presents a selection of songs along with insightful background of the different genres of the music. The book was revised in 2008. More Hispanic Folk Songs of New Mexico was planned for publication in 2014. His magnum opus, often referred to as the Big Book, is the authoritative, Hispanic Folk Music of New Mexico and the Southwest: A Self-Portrait of a People, which was out of print for many years and achieved \\"collectable\\" status. A revised edition, from UNM Press, was published in March 2014. Here is what University of Oklahoma Press wrote when the book was first published in 1980: \\"In some 700 songs and melodies, most with English translations and musical transcriptions, the author presents the Hispanic folk music of the Southwestern United States in all its rich variety. This is truly a panoramic survey of Hispanic folk music, including representation of every formal type and dozens of subjects, both secular and religious, from Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. Ethnomusicologists and folklorists will value this comprehensive work both for its unrivaled scope and for its musical emphasis. Those exploring Hispanic cultural heritage will find this book a treasure trove\\" . UNM John Donald Robb Musical Trust Upon the deaths of Robb and his wife, Harriet, in 1989, the Trust was established at the University of New Mexico College of Fine Arts by a self-supporting endowment. Managed by an all-volunteer board of directors, the Trust in collaboration with UNM works to further his inspiring commitment to education, and to advance the understanding of music in the Southwest by supporting the performance of Hispanic folk songs, along with the performance, study, promotion and dissemination of Robb's own music. Among its initiatives, the Trust co-sponsors the annual UNM John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium (see details below). The Trust also supports the biennial UNM John Donald Robb Commission Competition, which is open to composers from around the world. All entries must be built on folk-song source material from the John Donald Robb Archive of Southwestern Music. The winning composition is performed during the following UNM Composers' Symposium (University of New Mexico 2014). Past recipients have included Carl Donsbach (2004: Palomita: Canción for Piano Trio) ; Dr. Gary Smart (2008: Song of the Holy Ground for piano and string quartet) ; Colin Holter (2010: The Recording You Will Now Hear for piccolo, contrabass clarinet, clarinet, piano, vibraphone, violin and cello) ; Paul Clift (2012: 1950c for restrung classical guitar) ; Luke Dahn (2014: Buffalo Dance for alto saxophone and piano) ; Marta Gentilucci (2016: Dance, for flute, clarinet, violin, viola, cello, piano and percussion) ; and Kyong Mee Choi (2018: \\"Adiós a lo conocido\\" (Goodbye to the known) for violin, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, piano, and percussion) (; ). In addition, the Trust supports a graduate assistantship and small grants that advance the mission of the Trust . UNM John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium The Composers' Symposium brings internationally acclaimed composers to the UNM campus every spring for four days of concerts, master classes and seminars in one of the longest-running festivals of new music in the world (University of New Mexico 2013, 23). The symposium began in 1972 when UNM Music Professor William Wood invited his former teacher, Norman Lockwood, to the campus, where his compositions were performed, along with the works of UNM music composition students . In 1999, the symposium was renamed the John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium. The symposium is now presented jointly by the Trust and the UNM Department of Music. Included among the many distinguished guests have been Milton Babbitt, John Cage, Raven Chacon, Michael Colgrass, George Crumb, Joseph Daley, Julio Estrada, Lukas Foss, Alan Hovhaness, Karel Husa, Betsy Jolas, Ernst Krenek, John Lewis, Gordon Mumma, Thea Musgrave, Pauline Oliveros, Hilda Paredes, Vincent Persichetti, Ned Rorem, Joan Tower, Cecil Taylor, August Read Thomas, Hans Tutschku, Hildegard Westerkamp, Christian Wolff, and Chen Yi. Recent directors of the Symposium have included Christopher Shultis and, since 2012, Co-Artistic Directors Peter Gilbert and Karola Obermüller. Symposia have changed focus to a more interdisciplinary and theme-oriented format, including \\"Here Comes Everybody\\": A Celebration of the New Mexico Centennial was the theme of the 41st annual festival, which featured the contributions of New Mexico composers, both past and present (2012); the centenary of Igor Stravinsky's Rite of Spring (2013); the centerpiece of the 43rd annual Composers' Symposium was Cuatro Corridos, a one-hour chamber opera that told the true story of women trapped in a cycle of prostitution and slavery across the U.S.-Mexico border (2014); Musical Retellings explored folk and classical music in new ways (2015); Indigenizing Art Music: Experiencing the sound of Native American influences in new music (2016) featured guest composers Curt Cacioppo, Raven Chacon, Valerie Naranjo, Trevor Reed, and Christopher Shultis; the 46th annual John Donald Robb Composers' Symposium was a festival of contemporary music that brought together forty-seven composers and numerous ensembles and soloists from around the globe (2017), while the 2019 edition hosted the Society of Composers, Inc. National Conference . In 2020, Egbert Hiller, producer at the Deutschlandfunk, presented a 40-minute feature on the Composers' Symposium and the New Music scene in New Mexico and published an article in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik that discusses the Symposium in the context of New Music in New Mexico..

It is mainly resident, but partially migratory in the north-east of its range. Habitat This sunbird is common in gardens, fynbos, forests and coastal scrub. The southern double-collared sunbird breeds from April to December, depending on region. The closed oval nest is constructed from grass, lichen and other plant material, bound together with spider webs. It has a side entrance which sometimes has a porch, and is lined with wool, plant down and feathers. Identification Female The southern double-collared sunbird is 12 cm long. The adult male has a glossy, metallic green head, throat upper breast and back. It has a brilliant red band across the chest, separated from the green breast by a narrow metallic blue band. The rest of the underparts are whitish. When displaying, yellow feather tufts can be seen on the shoulders. As with other sunbirds the bill is long and decurved. The bill, legs and feet are black. The eye is dark brown. The male can be distinguished from the similar greater double-collared sunbird by its smaller size, narrower red chest band and shorter bill. The female southern double-collared sunbird has brown upperparts and yellowish-grey underparts. The juvenile resembles the female. The female is greyer below than the female orange-breasted sunbird, and darker below than the female dusky sunbird.Male, Kirstenbosch, South Africa. Behaviour The southern double-collared sunbird is usually seen singly or in small groups. Its flight is fast and direct on short wings. It lives mainly on nectar from flowers, but takes some fruit, and, especially when feeding young, insects and spiders. It can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perches to feed most of the time. The call is a hard chee-chee, and the song is high pitched jumble of tinkling notes, rising and falling in pitch and tempo for 3–5 seconds or more.

Part of CWO's original purpose was to explore orchestral music by women composers for TWP. Today, CWO is an independent and growing entity. It continues to focus on encouraging women in music, and includes at least one work by a woman composer on each of its programs. An assistant conductor is appointed annually in an effort to create more opportunities for women conductors, and Strings Attached - an entry-level ensemble - encourages the participation of women instrumentalists of varying abilities. In addition to its own concert season of three full concerts and a chamber music event, CWO appeared at four concerts at Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall as guests of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus (SFGMC), 2005-2008. Also in 2008, the CWO toured to Miami, Florida, to perform at the quadrennial GALA Choruses Festival. Mission The Community Women's Orchestra creates a welcoming environment to engage, inspire, and celebrate women in classical music. Women's music The CWO has been responsible for numerous regional, national, and world premieres of works by women composers, including Juliette Folville and Dame Ethel Smyth. In its 25th season (2009–2010), the CWO commissioned and premiered three new works by composers Martha Stoddard, Hilary Tann, and Mary Watkins, and premiered a newly orchestrated work by June Bonacich. CWO was the first contemporary orchestra to play Fanny Mendelssohn's Overture In C, when conductor JoAnn Falletta was in the process of reconstructing the work.See Letter From JoAnn Falletta , May 12, 2010 Dana Sadava was selected as CWO's new Musical Director for the 30th anniversary season. Dana Sadava served as Assistant Conductor during the 2007-2008 season. Ms. Sadava’s recent engagements include Wexford Festival Opera, the Boulder Chamber Orchestra, Pensacola Opera, Indianapolis Opera, the new music ensemble Zero Blue, and Banff Opera as Theatre, where she was a faculty member of the opera training program. She has been featured in master classes with Marin Alsop, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Gustav Meier. Ms. Sadava has a Bachelor of Science degree from the California Institute of Technology. She subsequently studied conducting with Michael Morgan and Alasdair Neale at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and with Kenneth Kiesler at the University of Michigan.

The eldest of two daughters born to Robert Mifflin Wade (1874–1944) and Lola Heller Hess Wade (1878–1941), her family called her by her middle name, Jean, and she followed that tradition through adulthood.Jean Wade Rindlaub Papers, 1899–1991; MC 693, folders #1.1–1.2. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Jean and her younger sister, Mary Emily (1911–1973), were schooled at home by their father who operated the Pennsylvania Business and Shorthand College. Jean learned shorthand and typing at a young age and by age eleven could type 50 words per minute. As a young adult she worked as a secretary to the advertising manager of the local Armstrong Cork Company. Within a short time, she began assisting with copywriting.Jean Wade Rindlaub Papers, 1899–1991; MC 693, folders #1.3–1.6. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Rindlaub left Pennsylvania in 1930, relocating to New York City to marry Willard W. Rindlaub (1903–1983). Within a month she began working at the prestigious advertising agency, Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BBDO). Though Rindlaub worked full-time during her long marriage she and her husband had two children, John Wade Rindlaub (born 1934) and Anne Rindlaub Dow (1938–2003). Career Though hired as a secretary, Jean Rindlaub was quickly promoted to copywriter as an expert on \\"woman’s viewpoint.\\" Throughout her 33-year career at BBDO, she conducted extensive market research that surveyed thousands of women about their needs and reactions to products.Rothenberg, Randall (December 18, 1989).

New York Times She worked on over fifty major accounts in the areas of food (including convenience foods and kitchen equipment), cosmetics, clothing, and other products targeted to women consumers. Her early clients included Bond Bread, Duff's Gingerbread, Enna Jettick shoes, and Strutwear. She led successful advertising campaigns for some of the most influential manufacturing companies in America, including Campbell Soup Company, Carter’s clothing, General Mills, Oneida Limited silverware and United Fruit Company. The first campaign that won Jean Rindlaub widespread critical acclaim promoted Oneida silverware during WWII. Called “Back Home for Keeps,” the ads featured young couples in love, planning for future happiness, once the war ended and soldiers were back in the United States. The ads provided a symbol of hope for both young women at home and soldiers abroad who used them as pin-up posters.Jean Wade Rindlaub Papers, 1899–1991; MC 693, folder #1.8. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. After the war, Rindlaub specialized in food ads. She founded BBDO’s first test kitchen to develop new recipes and products for General Mills and United Fruit. She oversaw one of many revisions of Betty Crocker's image and invested considerable effort in marketing Betty Crocker cake mixes which, at the time, lagged behind Pillsbury and Duncan Hines. Under her guidance, Betty Crocker cake mixes led the consumer market. One of the most influential women in advertising, Rindlaub served as a director of Advertising Women of New York (AANY). In 1944, she became the first woman elected vice president of BBDO. In 1951, the Advertising Federation of America named her “Advertising Woman of the Year,” shortly thereafter she became the first woman elected to BBDO’s board of directors (1954).\\"First Woman Director Is Elected by Agency,\\" New York Times, March 2, 1954, 40.

Rindlaub's career at BBDO was marked by successive awards before she retired in 1963. During retirement she worked as an advertising consultant and became increasingly active in community work for several groups, including the National Council of Women, Women of Christ Church and the Girl Scouts. In 1989 the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame inducted Rindlaub as an honoree.

Life Braund was born in Bideford, Devon, England and was educated at Bideford Grammar School and migrated with his family to New South Wales, when he was 15. In 1889 his family moved to Armidale. In 1893, Braund was commissioned second lieutenant in the Armidale company, 4th Australian Infantry Regiment and promoted to captain in 1899, major in 1912 and lieutenant-colonel in 1914. He was a magistrate and for many years was president of the Armidale Chamber of Commerce. Braund was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1913, representing Armidale for the Liberal Party. War service With the outbreak of the Great War and the creation of the Australian Imperial Force, Braund was appointed to raise and train the 2nd Infantry Battalion and he became its commander in August 1914. He was the first member of an Australian parliament to enlist in the war. On 25 April 1915, the first day of the landing at Anzac Cove, he landed with his troops and under sustained fire took and held a vital but isolated position. After midnight on 4 May, while returning to brigade headquarters, he took a short cut through scrub and apparently failed to hear a challenge from a sentry, who then shot him dead. He was one of only two serving Australian members of parliament to die in the Great War. Braund was survived by a wife, two sons and a daughter. Honours He was posthumously mentioned in dispatches. On 30 November 1915 in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly the Speaker unveiled a commemorative tablet in honour of Braund and Sergeant Edward Larkin, the Member for Willoughby who also fell at Gallipoli.

The devoted Portuguese nurse took a journey only to find herself lost in abstract drama. There she finds that \\"she brought a living man among the dead.\\"Quoted from the distributor's official synopsis Costa made the film in a densely minimalist style. Cryptic ellipses, cinematographic precision, narrative abstraction and lingering imagery of people and place, notably Mount Fogo, the highest active volcano of Cape Verde, are features in this melancholic meditation on love and loneliness.

He was an All-Skyline Conference and an honorable mention All- American basketball player in 1951. He was also invited and competed in the 1952 United States Men's Olympic Basketball Team tryouts in New York City. Andersen was hired in 1956 as an assistant coach for University of Utah coach Jack Gardner. Andersen left the Utes in 1961 to become head coach of his alma mater. Andersen as a player for the Utah State Aggies men's basketball team, circa 1951. During his tenure as the Aggies head coach, Utah State made four appearances in the NCAA Basketball Tournament including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1970, losing to eventual champion UCLA. Andersen also led them to two appearances in the National Invitation Tournament. He compiled a record of 176–96 (.647) at the school from 1961 to 1971. Former LSU coaching great Dale Brown served as an assistant coach during Andersen's tenure. Andersen recommended Brown as his successor, but when USU officials rejected the idea, Brown went to Washington State for one season as an assistant before succeeding Press Maravich as LSU's coach, where he remained for 25 seasons (1972–97), compiling a 448-301 record. Andersen was also the head coach of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars for two seasons (1971–72 and 1972–73). Andersen had success with the team and led them to two Western Division regular season titles but both seasons were ended by the Indiana Pacers in the Western Division playoff finals. Andersen compiled a 115–43 (.684) regular season coaching record with the Stars. Despite his success with the Stars, Andersen resigned after his second season with the team. He returned to Utah State University and was appointed as the school's athletic director in 1973. Andersen held the post for ten years until he was lured back into coaching again in 1983 for Brigham Young University (BYU). Andersen coached the Cougars for six years and compiled a 114–71 (.616) record. BYU made four post season appearances including three in the NCAA Basketball Tournament and one in the National Invitation Tournament. He resigned as BYU head coach in 1989 and was replaced by Roger Reid. Andersen continued to be involved in basketball acting as a scout and consultant for the NBA's Utah Jazz organization, partly because of his connections with former Utah State player and longtime Jazz assistant Phil Johnson. It is believed that he was the person who scouted John Stockton and encouraged the Jazz to draft him when they did. Andersen died on December 29, 2019 at age 90.

Left to right: Ensigns Emi and Yumi Hanner, Lt. (junior grade) Kojiro Sakai; Lt. K. Kim; Lt. Makoto Yamamoto; Lt. Commander Justy Ueki Tylor; Lt. Commander Yuriko Star; Lt. H. Katori; Master Sgt. M. Cryburn; First Lt. K. B. Andresen; Petty Officer Harumi; and Naval Surgeon H. Kitaguchi. This list contains the primary and notable secondary characters in The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, a Japanese anime series.  Characters = United Planets Space Force  * ': The mysterious, irresponsible man. Tylor, age 20, joined the United Planets Space Force for, what he hoped would be, an easy life. Originally assigned to the Pension department, he unwittingly foiled a terrorist plot to kidnap and kill a retired UPSF admiral when he tried to deliver a late check by hand. For saving the war hero's life, Tylor was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and placed in command of the destroyer Soyokaze (the UPSF dumping ground for trouble makers and the unwanted). Tylor has, as his superiors have put it, 'The Devil's own luck' and usually can get out of any situation relatively unscathed, avoiding multiple assassination attempts and defeating enemy groups of vastly superior numbers. He is very laid back and does not really care for the rules, using his authority as captain to change whatever regulations seem too uptight for him. He is also easily led by his crew, who are able to convince him to allow them to wear comfortable clothes on watch, hold a swimsuit competition, and let the surgeon drink while on duty. The UPSF and the Ralgon Empire are constantly debating whether Tylor possesses the most brilliant military mind or whether he is just a lucky moron. Tylor's name is a reference both to Hitoshi Ueki and to the role Ueki played in Toho's 1960s Irresponsible Man series, Hitoshi Taira (Taira and Tylor are homophones in Japanese). * Lt. Makoto Yamamoto: A very strait-laced, by-the-book military man. Yamamoto is the first officer on the Soyokaze and tried mightily to interject an air of professionalism to the outfit. Constantly enraged by Tylor's lack of discipline and his loose command of the troops, Yamamoto spends much of his free time in the medic's office taking tranquilizers and making use of the neuro-cleanser. Yamamoto sees Tylor for what he is, a bumbling fool, but is torn between the unwritten soldier's code of supporting and obeying your superior officer, and telling the UPSF brass what is REALLY going on. He is always on the lookout for a chance to get some form of command, hoping to get a ship of his own one day. By the end of the series, Yamamoto begins to warm up to and respect Tylor. * Lt. Commander Yuriko Star: Another by-the-book officer. Yuriko joined the UPSF to give her life structure, and applied for the Soyokaze, a ship known as a dump for disruptive elements, in order to reform its crew into proper soldiers. She attempts to obey the rules in almost every situation, and refuses to mix work and private life, to some degree even going as far as not having a life outside the uniform herself. She, unlike Yamamoto, has no problem telling Tylor that he has done something wrong, and spends as much effort trying to reform him as she spends on the rest of the crew together. During the OVA, we see a relationship develop between Tylor and herself, Yuriko even going as far as asking Tylor to meet up with her on Christmas Eve. * Lt. Kyunghwa Kim: Helm and Communications Officer to the Soyokaze. Looking for purpose in life, Lt. Kim joined the UPSF because she believed that putting her life in danger would put her future into focus. Like the rest of the crew, she sees Tylor as an irresponsible leader with only luck saving him. However she does use this to her advantage by wearing non-regulatory clothing on board the ship as Tylor does not object to it. Kim is up to date with the latest fashion and, while on leave, does do some modelling in her spare time. * Lt. Harold Katori: Pilot and Navigator to the Soyokaze. Katori is a well-mannered helmsman who is confident in his navigational skills. He sometimes refers to the way of the Buddha when making a point but it is still a surprise when it is revealed that he is actually bald and wears a blonde wig. * Nurse Petty Officer Harumi: Assigned to the Soyokaze as the doctor's assistant, the beautiful Harumi has every man on board lining up at the infirmary for minor things like cut fingers or stomach aches. Harumi is very professional with all of them, but seems to take a large interest in the captain. It turns out that she is a Raalgon spy, first sent to learn about, then to track, and eventually to kill Tylor. He manages to talk her out of her assassination plans (further impressing the Raalgon military) and feeds her just enough information to make it look like her spying is working, but not enough to endanger the Soyokaze and her crew. Her role in the light novel is much smaller than in the animated television series. In episode 14, she openly confesses that she is in fact not \\"human\\", but an android, which was already shortly mentioned in episode 12 and the preview to episode 14. * The Marines: Soldiers led by First Lt. Andressen and Master Sergeant Cryborne, the Marines are a rough and crude bunch who are always spoiling for a fight. They usually keep to themselves in their section of the ship and run that part pretty much as they see fit, bristling whenever Yamamoto or Yuriko venture down and demand a cleanup. The Marines use yellow powered exoskeletons (pink for Cryborne) which are so small that the marines have to crouch inside to pilot them. * Lt. (junior grade) Kojiro: The star pilot of the Soyokaze. Kojiro is famous on board for his misogyny, not allowing any women near his plane or himself, but this is more gynophobia, being aggressive to any women trying to get physically close to him. Despite this, Kojiro later volunteers to teach the twins how to be fighter pilots when he sees their natural abilities in the cockpit. Kojiro is also very hot- headed, getting into fights with the Marines at the slightest provocation. * Ensigns Emi and Yumi Hanner: Daughters of Admiral Hanner, one of the UPSF's most decorated war heroes, the twins first came into contact with Tylor when he came to deliver their father's pension check and saved them from being killed by the terrorist's bomb. They immediately signed up with the UPSF and used their father's influence to get themselves assigned to the Soyokaze to be with Tylor. Once aboard, they trained to be pilots under Kojiro, who recognized that they had natural talent that exceeded what a standardized pilot's test could measure. These twins are never seen apart, and in fact each have one half of their hairstyle. They are strong supporters of Tylor, even wanting to become his lovers. * The Brass: Admirals Mifune and Fuji are Tylor's superior officers in the UPSF. They know that Tylor is not qualified to be a captain, or even to work in the Pension department, but his successes keep forcing them to commend and promote him. Mifune and Fuji tried to kill Tylor on a couple of occasions, but later shunted he and his crew out to the Demotion Sector, far from the fighting and, more importantly, far away from UPSF headquarters. Ironically, it is Mifune, the admiral who dislikes him most, whom comes to appreciate him for his unconventional (and thus non- stagnant) approach to warfare. This becomes most evident in the later productions in the Tylor universe, where a grudging Mifune frequently turns to Tylor as a troubleshooter for sticky situations.  The Holy Raalgon Empire  The Raalgon Empire is based on elf-like people commonly wearing eastern clothes such as turbans, often with horns on their head attire. Their technology seems techno-organic. * Azalyn: The 16-year-old empress of the Holy Raalgon Empire. Azalyn is a child, forced into the unenviable situation of having to assume power of the empire once her parents are murdered. Prompted by her advisors, she gives the command to attack the UPSF (assuming that they were behind the assassination plot). Having not had a chance to be a child, Azalyn must now be strong for the entire empire, and it's a task that she is afraid of taking, but even more afraid of failing. * Wang: Chief advisor to the Empress, Wang yearns for greater power. He is a master at twisting the opinions of the court, forcing Azalyn to take his suggestions, in effect letting Wang control things as he sees fit. Even this is not enough and Wang makes a couple of attempts on Azalyn's life in hopes that the reins of power will fall to him. * Captain Dom: Dom is the commander of one of the Raalgon fleets. He speaks candidly with the Empress, in stark contrast to the bowing and scraping and lying of the rest of her court. Dom gains Azalyn's trust and becomes one of her more valued advisors. Dom is also very interested in Tylor, feeling that Tylor would be not only a worthy adversary, but also a challenge for anyone to decipher and defeat. It is Dom who assigned Harumi to spy on the Soyokaze's enigmatic captain, but even with the constant data coming in from his valued spy, Dom is still unsure whether Tylor really knows what he is doing or if he is just a fool. During the OVA his personality goes further, hitting on Yuriko when she and the Soyokaze crew were captured, as well as whipping Tylor after believing him to repeatedly make emotional and sexual assaults on Azalyn. *Shia Has: a Raalgon commander, and often partnered with Dom. Wears a bikini, a cape, and a horned helmet. She is unswervingly loyal to the Raalgon Empire. Like Dom, she is sent to deal with the Soyokaze, but after being tricked by Tylor, she becomes far more critical of him than others. Oddly, she never shows any relationship with Dom other than strong comradeship. During the OVA, she tries to use her sexual wiles on the captured Kojiro only for him to faint from a nosebleed.

It is grown for their edible tubers, though it has smaller tubers than the more widely-cultivated Dioscorea alata and is usually spiny. Names In Vietnam, it is called khoai từ or củ từ. It is used to make chè củ từ, also referred to as chè khoai từ. In Tagalog, it is known as tugi, while in Cebuano it is called apali. It is cultivated in Kerala, Goa, Konkan parts of Maharashtra India. In Malayalam, it is known as nana kizhangu or nheruvalli kizhangu or Cheru Kizhangu\\". In Goa it is called Kaate Kanaga (काटे कणगा ), It is a climber which needs support and goes coiling around the support. History of cultivation The lesser yam is the second most important yam crop among Austronesians. Like D. alata, it requires minimal processing, unlike the other more bitter yam species. However, it has smaller tubers than D. alata and is usually spiny. Like D. alata it was introduced to Madagascar and the Comoros by Austronesians, where it spread to the East African coast. They are also a dominant crop in Near Oceania, However, it did not reach to the furthest islands in Polynesia, being absent in Hawaii and New Zealand. Starch grains identified to be from the lesser yam have been recovered from archaeological sites of the Lapita culture in Viti Levu, Fiji, dated to around 3,050 to 2,500 cal BP. D. esculenta is believed to have been introduced by the Lapita culture into New Guinea, along with agricultural innovations like wet cultivation. Traces of D. esculenta (along with D. alata, D. bulbifera, D. nummularia and D. pentaphylla) yams have also been identified from the Mé Auré Cave site in Moindou, New Caledonia, dated to around 2,700 to 1,800 BP. Remains of D. esculenta have also been recovered from archaeological sites in Guam, dated to around 1031 CE.  Taxonomy  Belonging to the genus Dioscorea, Dioscorea esculenta describes the plant's ability to produce edible roots. Description The plant's stems are round and thin, with big, black compound spines that are 2–4 cm long. The leaves are soft, heart-shaped, and 5–8 cm long and 6–8 cm wide.

It is measured in length over time, such as \\"mm/second\\" or \\"inches/second\\". Among the variables affecting burn rate are pressure and temperature. Burn rate is an important parameter especially in the area of propellants because it determines the rate at which exhaust gases are generated from the burning propellant which in turn decides the rate of flow through the nozzle. The thrust generated in the rocket of missile depends on this rate of flow. Thus Knowing quantitatively the burning rate of a propellant, and how it changes under various conditions, is of fundamental importance in the successful design of a solid rocket motor. The concept of Burning rate is also relevant in case of liquid propellants. Measurement One device for measuring burning rate is a V shaped metal channel about 1–2 feet long wherein a sample is placed, with a cross-sectional dimension of approximately 6 mm or 1/4\\". The sample is ignited on one end and time is measured until the flame front gets to the other end. Burn rate (typically expressed in 'mm/s' or 'in/s') is the sample length over time at a given pressure and temperature. For solid fuel propellant, the most common method of measuring burn rate is the Crawford Type Strand Burning Rate Bomb Systemhttp://www.ditusa.com/strand_burner.php Crawford Burner System (Strand Burner) for Testing Burn Rate (also known as the Crawford Burner or Strand Burner), as described in MIL-STD-286C.http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL- STD-0100-0299/MIL-STD-286C_8618/  Characterisation  A substance is characterised through burn rate vs pressure chart and burn rate vs temperature chart. * Higher burn rate than the speed of sound in the material (usually several km/s): \\"detonation\\" * A few meters per second: \\"deflagration\\" * A few centimeters per second: \\"burn\\" or \\"smoulder\\" * 0.01 mm/s to 100 mm/s: \\"decomposing rapidly\\" to characterise it. However, there is difference in opinion in differentiating the three in absence of firm numbers at given pressure or temperature.

The man standing highlighted at center on Rembrandt's Night Watch painting is Frans Banning Cocq. He was Mayor of Amsterdam, Lord of Purmerland and Ilpendam and Lord of castle Ilpenstein. During the Dutch Golden Age the country surrounding villages like these was Amsterdam's breadbasket, as the draining of bogland created bountiful fertile soil. However, the draining of the soil caused it to shrink, until it reached the water level of the Zuiderzee only a few miles to the east. Soil erosion thus brought about the demise of Purmerland's limited prominence. Nowadays the population is largely made up of town people seeking a country retreat in a small village now characterised by large mansions which have replaced the orihinal smaller cottages.

He was notable for his involvement in the controversial resignation of architect Jørn Utzon from the Sydney Opera House project in 1966. Early life Hughes was born in Launceston, Tasmania and was educated at Launceston High School and the University of Tasmania, although he did not graduate. He married Joan Johnson in 1940 and they had one son and two daughters. He was a school teacher in Tasmania from 1927 until 1935, at Caulfield Grammar in Melbourne, from 1936 until he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and at The Armidale School from 1947 until 1950. He served in the RAAF from 1939 until 1945, achieving the rank of squadron leader. Political career Hughes was elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Armidale from 1950 to 1953 and 1956 to 1973 for the Country Party. He was chosen to lead the party in 1958, but his term of office was brief because he was forced to resign in 1959 after it was revealed that he did not have the university degree which he claimed. Hughes criticized Sydney Opera House construction management With the election of the Askin government in 1965, Hughes became Minister for Public Works, with responsibility for, among other things, the completion of the Sydney Opera House. Hughes refused to accept Jørn Utzon's approach to managing the Opera House project and, specifically, the construction of plywood prototypes for its interiors. Hughes refused to pay a fee claim for £51,000, which meant that Utzon could not pay his staff. After a heated discussion about the claim, Utzon sent a letter of withdrawal to Hughes on 28 February 1966, stating: \\"You have forced me to the leave the job\\".P.Drew, 1999. p.350 In his media announcement made only hours after receiving the letter, Hughes stated it was Utzon's 'resignation'. The Opera House was completed by another architect, Peter Hall, an ex-government architect from Sydney. Taking on the project, Hall deemed Utzon's seating plan as unsafe, to improve this he subsequently made radical changes to the interior design, a decision that he would be largely criticised for. Despite this, the Opera House was completed under his watch and it eventually opened in 1973. Upon his resignation from parliament in January 1973, Hughes was appointed NSW Agent-General in London. He died at Erina, New South Wales.  Later life  Hughes died in Erina, New South Wales on 16 March 2003, aged 92.  Honours  Hughes was knighted in 1975, two years after resigning from parliament.

He was a member of the Baroda Group and gained international recognition for his work. Works Khakhar was a self-trained artist, and started his career as a painter relatively late in his life. His works were figurative in nature, concerned with the human body and its identity. An openly gay artist,BBC news the problem of gender definitions and gender identity were major themes of his work. His paintings often contained references to Indian mythology and mythological themes. Early life Bhupen Khakhar was born in Bombay and spent his boyhood in the area called Khetwadi with his parents and three siblings. He was the youngest of four children, and his father, Parmanand, was an engineer and was an external examiner at VJTI matunga, Mumbai. Parmanand drank heavily and died when Bhupen was only four years old. His mother Mahalaxmi was a housewife, and she soon invested all of her hopes in her youngest child. The Khakhars were originally artisans who came from the Portuguese colony of Diu. At home they spoke Gujarati, Marathi and Hindi, but not much English. Bhupen was the first of his family to attend the University of Bombay, where he took a B.A., with Economics and Political Sciences as his special subjects. At his family's insistence he went on to take a Bachelor of Commerce from Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics and qualified as a Chartered Accountant. Khakhar worked as an accountant for many years partnering with Bharat Parikh & Associates in Baroda Gujarat India., pursuing his artistic inclinations in his free time. He became well versed in Hindi mythology and literature, and well informed about the visual arts. In 1958, Khakhar met the young Gujarati poet and painter Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, who encouraged Khakhar's latent interest in art and encouraged him to come to the newly founded Faculty of Fine Arts in Baroda.Bhupen Khakhar, Timothy Hyman, Chemould Publications and Mapin Publishing, 1998, Career Khakhar's oil paintings were often narrative and autobiographical. His first exhibited works presented deities cut from popular prints, glued onto mirrors, supplemented by graffiti and gestural marks. He began to mount solo exhibitions as early as 1965. Though the artist had been largely self-taught, his work soon garnered attention and critical praise. By the 1980s Khakhar was enjoying solo shows in places as far away as London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Tokyo.Vadehra Art Gallery, 20th Century Museum of Contemporary Art www.contemporaryindianart.com The artist's work celebrated the day to day struggles of India's common man. Khakhar's early paintings depicted average people, such as the barber, the watch repairman, and even an assistant accountant with whom he worked. The painter took special care to reproduce the environments of small Indian shops in these paintings, and revealed a talent for seeing the intriguing within the mundane.Bhupen Khakhar, A Retrospective, Timothy Hyman, The National Gallery of Modern Art and the Fine Art Resource, 2003 His work has been compared to that of David Hockney. He was a long standing personal friend of Howard Hodgkin who regularly came to stay with him after meeting in 1975.Though he was influenced by the British Pop movement, Khakhar understood that western versions of Pop Art would not have the same resonance in India.Contemporary Art in Baroda, Tulika Publishers, 1997, Khakhar's often openly homosexual themes attracted special notice. Homosexuality was something that at the time was rarely addressed in India. The artist explored his own homosexuality in extremely personal ways, touching upon both its cultural implications and its amorous and erotic manifestations. Khakhar painted homosexual love, life, and encounters from a distinctively Indian perspective.Bhupen Khakhar, Timothy Hyman, Chemould Publications and Mapin Publishing, 1998, In the 1990s Khakhar began experimenting more with watercolours and grew increasingly confident in both expression and technique.A Guide to 101 Modern and Contemporary Indian Artists, Amrita Jhaveri, India Book House, 2005 He found himself portrayed as \\"the accountant\\" in Salman Rushdie's novel The Moor's Last Sigh.

Cox, also a true crime author, wrote an unpublished manuscript entitled The Associates in which the main character traveled the country to perpetrate a mortgage fraud similar to the one Cox ran. Cox falsified documents to make it appear that he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages on them for five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern and southwestern United States, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He was released from prison in July 2019. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.

In one instance he used the social security number of a toddler, and all of his documents—references, bank letters, rent receipts, W-2s from nonexistent employees—were counterfeit. He used his skills as an artist to decorate the properties with elaborate art deco-style murals.

Cox charmed Alison Arnold, a young local married woman, into believing he could give her a wealthy and luxurious life. While courting Arnold she said he took her to crime films such as The Italian Job and Catch Me if You Can—which he reportedly adored and watched several times—and detailed his criminal plans to her. Cox often filed fraudulent mortgage documents, and in several cases was able to mortgage properties for five to six times their actual worth. In this practice, known as \\"shotgunning\\" in the real estate community, Cox either himself forged or had accomplices attain inflated appraisals to increase the value of the mortgages.

His partners claimed to be unaware of Cox's dealings, and they were financially ruined by the collapse of the company. This article coincided with Cox getting a tip from a friend that a task force had been put together at the Tampa PD to investigate him, and the case had just been handed over to the FBI for further investigation. Part of what gave Cox' scheme away at this time is that all the synthetic identities he had created were based on the names of the characters of Quentin Tarantino's gangster film Reservoir Dogs and had obvious last names such as Red, Blue, Green and so on. Cox had used these different identities to create a false impression of a quickly appreciating neighborhood, and was able to fool banks and appraisers into believing that homes that were worth $40,000 were actually worth $190,000.

During this period, he traveled to Mobile, Alabama, and using the identity of a former co-worker, acquired credit cards and the credit needed to rent a home. After filing false documents that indicated he owned the house, Cox took out mortgages on the property for several hundred thousand dollars. He took out one mortgage under the name of The Simpsons character \\"C. Montgomery Burns\\". Cox acquired several more properties, then the couple moved to the Tallahassee, Florida area. Authorities in the Atlanta area discovered Cox's activities, and eventually his identity. On August 6, 2004, the United States Secret Service issued arrest warrants for Cox, alleging conspiracy, identity theft, mail and wire fraud, money laundering, and social security number fraud.Most wanted poster Matthew Cox (PDF), United States Secret Service, accessed April 5, 2007.

At this point, due to remorse and anxiety, Arnold called the FBI and confessed. She was sentenced to two years in prison for numerous offenses, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud and identity theft. Arnold was also ordered to pay $300,000 in restitution to her victims. Shortly thereafter, Cox filed multiple mortgages on two houses for $886,318 in Columbia, South Carolina in less than a week. An abstractor noticed this, and a fraud alert was issued on one of Cox's money-laundering bank accounts.

Before capture, fugitive cruised Greek isles, St. Petersburg Times, November 22, 2006, accessed December 14, 2010. Cox used a falsified passport to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor, suspected something about \\"Carter\\" didn't add up. When she found out he was originally from Florida, she researched him online and eventually discovered that the man she knew as \\"Joseph Carter\\" was really Matthew Cox. Fearing for the safety of Gardner's son, Taylor reached out to Jeff Testerman of the St. Petersburg Times, who had closely followed Cox for more than three years. Testerman in turn put Taylor in touch with Rebecca Hauck's lawyer. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence.Testerman, Jeff. Sitter's fears set arrest in motion, St. Petersburg Times, November 17, 2006, accessed April 4, 2007. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events.

On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and credit history, but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson could give him a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months as a result of her assistance in Cox's capture.Testerman, Jeff.

Cox was serving a 26-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), a low-security facility in Coleman, Florida. He was ordered to pay $5.97 million in restitution, and testify against his co-conspirators. As of 2010, the United States Attorney's office has not brought charges against any of his 13 Tampa-area cohorts, even though Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert A.

As mortgage fraud runs rampant, meaningful prosecutions in short supply, St. Petersburg Times, January 3, 2010, accessed October 25, 2010. While in prison, Cox mailed several letters to the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused politician Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White told him he could not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them.Testerman, Jeff. Swindler: I forged illegal deal with Tampa candidate, St. Petersburg Times, August 6, 2008, accessed December 14, 2010. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent.Testerman, Jeff. White's denial leaves too many questions, St. Petersburg Times, August 28, 2008, accessed December 14, 2010. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations \\"the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man.\\" White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights.Testerman, Jeff. Hillsborough commissioner again denies taking payoffs, St. Petersburg Times, August 8, 2008, accessed December 14, 2010. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations.Carlton, Sue. Let's use courts to clean our own house, St. Petersburg Times, August 8, 2008, accessed December 14, 2010. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison. During his time in prison, Cox introduced himself to arms trader Efraim Diveroli after reading a Rolling Stone article on him, and encouraged him to write a memoir. Diveroli agreed to let Cox write the memoir, as he had \\"boxes of evidence\\" under his bed while fighting his own trial. When Diveroli left the complex, he took the manuscript with him and Cox claims to not have been compensated for it since; as of 2019 the two are in a mediated settlement process. After writing this memoir, other inmates approached Cox to write their stories down, resulting in a number of true crime manuscripts being written by Cox in prison. He was released from federal prison in July 2019.https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2019/08/06/matthew-cox-emerges- from-prison-as-a-new-man-and-great-author/#70ecf8476b17  Unpublished novel  Authorities were amazed by the similarities between Cox's actual crimes and his unpublished manuscript, The Associates, which they found several years before Cox was arrested. The novel's protagonist, Christian, is 5 ft 7 in (170 cm), has brown hair and blue eyes. Cox is 5 ft 6 in (168 cm), has brown hair and green eyes. Both the protagonist and Cox drove a silver Audi TT, illegally acquired Tampa real estate worth $2.7 million, were alumni of the University of South Florida, had an intense fear of Interpol, and formerly worked as insurance seller. In the novel, the protagonist and a female accomplice rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta.'The Associates', NBC News.msn.com, April 1, 2007, accessed April 4, 2007. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area so that he can use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox was imprisoned for this same crime. It is believed that Cox researched the book and consulted lawyers and real estate professionals to \\"research for a book about a con man\\" - but used the insights he gained during these interviews not only for his book, but to prepare his actual fraudulent plans.

Pivot provides a simple, easy to use interface with a few features. It uses fixed-length 'sticks' to ensure size consistency during animation. Development and history=Peter Bone Peter Bone began programming when he was around 15 years old in IBM BASIC. Bone's father taught some basics and then the rest. He made some very simple games but learnt all of the basics of programming. Later, Bone did an engineering degree. Bone had the idea around 2001. Bone's step brother was attempting to create stickman animations using MS Paint. Bone would draw a stickman, save the file and then draw it again slightly moved and repeat. Bone would then use some video editing software to combine the frames into a movie. Apart from taking a very long time, one of the problems was keeping the proportions of the stickman constant. Peter Bone thought there must be an easier way but he couldn’t find anything online apart from very complex and expensive animation software such as Flash. A couple of months later the first version of Pivot was born. The name was created when he first saved the project after creating one line pivoting on another line and the name stuck. Bone then began uses Delphi to create his own programs named Pivot Animator. First release The first version of Pivot Animator had several software bugs. Stick figures were limited to one type of stick figure, the default stick figure. Animations could be saved in the PIV (Pivot Project File) or exported as Animated .GIFs (Graphics Interchangeable Format). Users were given few options of image optimization, compression or resizing when saving their animation. This was one of the first animation programs available on the computer. Pivot 2.2 The second major release of the Pivot Stickfigure Animator. This version implemented the 'Stick Figure Builder', which allowed users to create their own stick figure designs saved in the STK format. This allowed a much wider scope of animation choice for Pivot users. It also fixed a few minor bugs, added the buttons to the main interface to bring a stick figure in front or behind other figures, and could automatically check to make sure the user didn't lose any unsaved projects. Pivot 3.1 Beta This release was sent intentionally to the Pivot Animation groups for testing but the Beta was leaked from various unofficial sources to the general public. There was an improved interface, with new icons, a better default stickman with bolder arms and legs and a reorganization of the features. New features included the ability to import any image as a to be moved around in the animation like a stick figure. Another added feature was the ability to have multiple backgrounds in an animation. When a user saves a .piv file, the frame rate is saved with it. Pivot 4.1 Pivot 4.1 beta was released on January 2, 2013, with new features including. * Figure opacity * Extended canvas area * Multi-select and edit figures * Stretch segments using the Ctrl key * Rotate/scale figures using the Alt key * Image based figure and background selector * Split a segment into 2 in the figure builder * Copy and paste frames * Improved Gif export options and quality * Avi video export * Join figures tool * Png support for sprites and backgrounds * Keyboard shortcuts * Multiple languages and the ability to create your own translation * Multiple frame onion skins (0-9) * Undo / redo * Image preview of Stk files when loading figures Pivot Animator 4.1.10 was released as the \\"stable\\" version of 4.1 and is still the latest non-beta version so far (as of October 2015). Pivot 4.2 was announced on December 23, 2014 followed by a beta release on January 1, 2015. New features include copying and pasting selected stick figures and sprites, a transparent figure builder window, and the ability to export images in the Scalable Vector Graphics format.

He was a member of a notable landholding family of Kurdish origin in northern Syria. Early life and education Hananu was born to a wealthy family in Kafr Takharim and raised in Aleppo. There is dispute on his birth date: one source mentions he was born in 1879, while another mentions he was born in 1869. He studied at the Imperial High School in Aleppo, and continued his studies at the Ottoman Law Academy of the prestigious Mülkiye school in Constantinople. As a student, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress, the political organ that later took stage following the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Early career and views Upon graduation, Hananu briefly taught at the military academy. Later, he joined the bureaucracy of the Ottoman Empire, only to retire and manage his estates. One Syrian source from the United Arab Republic era indicates that having embraced nationalism when the Arab Revolt broke out in 1916, Hananu joined the Arab army of Faisal I and entered Aleppo with the Allies in 1918.Adham al-Jundi, Tarikh al-thawrat al- suriyya fi 'ahd al-intidab al-faransi, Damascus, 1960. Supposedly, he also joined the secret nationalist society al-Fatat, though there is no corroborating evidence for this. Along with many of the prominent merchants in Aleppo, Hananu became associated with the League of National Defense and the Arab Club of Aleppo. The Hananu Revolt Breaking out in the autumn of 1919 in the countryside surrounding Aleppo, when the French army had landed on the Syrian coast and was preparing to occupy all of Syria, Hananu launched his revolt, bringing Aleppo, Idlib and Antioch into a coordinated campaign against French forces. Hananu was responsible for the disarmament of many French troops, the destruction of railroads and telegraph lines, the sabotage of tanks, and the foiling of French attacks on Aleppo. On July 23, 1920, when the French army successfully attacked Aleppo, Hananu was forced to retreat back to his village of Kafr Takharim Nahiyah and began to reorganize the revolt with Najeb Awad. The rebels decided to form a civilian government based in Armanaz, and sent Hananu to Turkey as a representative of the new civilian government to request for aid in fighting against the French. He received aid from the Turkish nationalist movement of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, which was battling the French army of the Levant for control of Cilicia and southern Anatolia. With the withdrawal of Turkish military assistance following the signing of the Franklin-Bouillon Agreement in October 1921, Hananu and his men could no longer sustain a revolt, and their struggle collapsed. Despite the failure of the revolt, the organization of the northern areas of Syria with Turkish help has been interpreted as a prototype for self-government that Hananu and other Syrians built upon in later years.James Gelvin, Divided Loyalties: Nationalism and Mass Politics in Syria at the Close of the Empire, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA, 1998, pp. 133-134. Trial In 1922 Ibrahim Hananu was arrested and presented to the French military criminal court on charges of criminal acts, and the first sessions was on 15 March 1922 . One of the best lawyers at that time, Fathallah Saqqal defended Hananu, advocated for Hananu's innocence, and argued that Hananu was a political opponent not a criminal. On 25 March 1922 the French Attorney General requested the execution of Hananu, and he said \\"if Hananu has seven heads I will cut them all\\", but the French judge ultimately released Hananu following an agreement between him and the French government. Later years Hananu was put under house arrest following the trial and his movements were monitored by the French intelligence. However, Hananu was released after the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925. Hananu went on to play an active role in the Syrian national movement. He was one of the founding fathers of the National Bloc which steered the course of the independence struggle in Syria until its achievement in 1946. He was a member of the National Bloc's permanent council and chief of its political bureau. In 1928, Hananu held office on the Constitutional Assembly that drafted the first republican constitution for Syria. In the 1930s, he affirmed his reputation as a hard-liner, refusing to negotiate with the French until they pledged complete unconditional independence for Syria.Philip Khoury, Syria and the French Mandate, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1987. Assassination attempt In September 1933, an individual named Nazi Al-Kousa shot Hananu in the legs in his village, Kafr Tkharem. Regarded as an assassination attempt, the shooter was sentenced to 10 years in jail. The French commissioner later pardoned Nazi al- Kousa. Death Hananu died in 1935 in Aleppo. His death was attributed to tuberculosis. The three-day mourning period began the day after with newspapers and magazines being published in a black cover. He is considered to be one of the most celebrated individuals in the resistance against the French Mandate.

He played 426 games between 1966 and 1989, making 19005 runs at a batting average of 30.55 with 28 hundreds. David Turner played for Hampshire in 24 consecutive seasons, which, with the impact of the First World War on certain players, is the longest unbroken run in their history. He is also the only Hampshire cricketer to have been in sides that won the Championship, Sunday League and a Lord’s Final. Hampshire were not the only county who sought to sign the promising young left-hander but he came to the county, making his first-class debut in August 1966, when just 17. He was not a regular member of the side in the early seasons, but in August 1969, scored 181* at the Oval, still Hampshire’s highest maiden century in a Championship match. In the next two seasons, he passed 1,000 runs with more centuries, and in mid-May, 1972, he impressed the touring Australians, taking 131 off their attack, including Lillee, at Southampton. He was spoken of as a Test prospect, but a few weeks later at Basingstoke retired hurt with an eye injury from a short ball, which seemed to dent his confidence. He was nonetheless back in the side as an ever-present with 1,000 runs as Hampshire won the title in 1973 - from then until he retired in 1989, he continued to score runs in both formats and by the end he had passed 1,000 runs in nine seasons. With the covering of pitches in his later years, his average rose into the 40s, and to 49.18 in his ‘Indian Summer’ of 1987 – for Hampshire he finished with 18,683 first-class runs and 27 centuries. He scored almost 10,000 limited-overs runs for Hampshire, and fittingly was at the wicket with his captain when Hampshire won their first Lord’s Final in 1988. He was also a very fine out-fielder with a fierce accurate throw, and while he was no bowler, in the 1960s, when the authorities briefly revived single-wicket competitions among county cricketers, he, rather than Hampshire’s all-rounders or big-hitting bowlers, was the county’s champion in 1967 & 1968\\\\. In addition, in 1981, he took a hat-trick in a limited-overs ‘Lambert & Butler’s’ tournament. He retired to take over the family shoe business, back home in Wiltshire. His highest score was 184 not out against Gloucestershire at Gloucester in 1987, when he and Gordon Greenidge put on 311 for the third wicket, and Hampshire won by an innings.Wisden 1988, p. 414.

It took till 2001 for the band to take shape when at Sevenoaks School in Kent, Cooke and von Bülow-Quirk came together with Chris Porter and JP Duncan to form The Fingerprints. The Fingerprints set about their musical career by self-recording two albums; Cards on the Table, Clothes on the Floor and Miranda. Tracks such as \\"Tangerine\\" appeared on local radio stations such as BBC Radio Kent and KMFM. The band also started gigging locally in the South-East during this time, with regular gigs at the Tunbridge Wells Forum helping them to develop a modest regional fanbase, performing in front of 8,000 people on one eventful Christmas. The Fingerprints disbanded in late 2004 when their bassist left. The band decided to continue as a four-piece and on the day of their first rehearsal \\"Walk With Me\\" was created. The band continued to write more songs but this time they had a maturer more electronic-influenced sound. The sessions created tracks for the Valves and Robots EP such as \\"Passchendaele\\" and \\"Isabella\\" which not only became fan favourites but impressed influential members of the industry and in late 2005 the band signed a deal for a one-off single with indie label Transgressive Records. The following months saw GoodBooks establishing a place within the UK alternative scene on a wider scale with gigs all over the country, notably supporting Art Brut and a gig with The Magic Numbers in Sweden. \\"Walk With Me\\" was rerecorded and was released as the band's debut single on Transgressive on 3 April 2006 on 7\\" vinyl and cassette only (one of only a very small number of cassette singles released that year). The video was shown on MTV2 and NME awarded it Runner-Up in its track of the week section, proclaiming GoodBooks \\"the best new band in Britain\\".NME Magazine - 15 April 2006, Tracks - p39. The band were approached by Columbia Records at the start of 2006 and signed a deal in May, releasing the singles \\"Turn it Back\\" and \\"Leni\\" in the second half of 2006 as well as making important and well-received performances at the Carling Reading and Leeds Festivals and the Truck Festival; their debut album, Control, was released on 30 July 2007 in the UK.An Interview with the band on the Tom Robinson show, BBC 6 Music - 1 May 2007. The band maintained a Myspace page with updates on their progress. This page reported that their second album, with the working title 'Cry Of The Hunters', was completed and would be released in Summer 2009. NME claimed that this would occur on 4 May, although the album has yet to be released. GoodBooks disbanded after Glastonbury 2009, where they played their last set on the John Peel Stage on 28 June 2009.

Used as an additive in many forms of artwork, Liquin is produced by Winsor & Newton and has a number of uses. Origin Alkyd resin medium for artists was first invented in the 1970s by Arthur DeCosta, a longtime professor at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. DeCosta's medium, Turco Classic, was sold only locally at the Academy's school store, the Philadelphia Utrecht Linen art supply store, and one or two other privately owned art supply stores. DeCosta believed his medium had similar qualities to Maroger medium (Jacques Maroger), the fast drying, supposed medium of the Old Masters. Because Maroger medium must be cooked with lead, Turco lacked its inherent danger and had a similar, if not faster, drying time. \\"The Kid,\\" as DeCosta called the young man responsible for the manufacture of Turco, often made poor batches of the product and DeCosta, being a full-time professor as well as a prominent Philadelphia painter (notable for his portrait of former mayor Frank Rizzo), gave up on the enterprise sometime in the early 1980s. Since then many companies have produced similar products, Liquin being the most popular. Method Winsor & Newton suggests the use of Liquin as a fat or flexible agent, to increase the flexibility subsequent layers.Winsor & Newton:Understanding The 3 Oil Painting Rules While Liquin Original, and Liquin Light Gel Medium are mixtures of petroleum distillates, Liquin Oleopasto, and Liquin Impasto are mixtures of alkyd resin and petroleum distillates. Innovation Notably, it is used to speed the drying time in oil painting, though it may also be used as a barrier layer to achieve some effects. Painted over the top of etchings, Indian-ink drawings and other line art, it enables the application of colours by tinting with thin glazes of oil paint. This technique was first discovered by the artist Patrick Woodroffe and is outlined in his book A Closer Look (Paper Tiger, 1986, ). Liquin also permits the creation of \\"save\\" layers in painting. Painted over all, or part, of an artwork in progress (and left to dry), Liquin allows the artist to scrape or wipe back subsequent work to the Liquin layer, while preserving all work beneath. It can also be used as a simple carrier base and, when compressed together with paint under a layer of plastic wrap, produces effective decalcomania.

Her first novel, The Thousand Faces of Night, won the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for the best first novel in 1993. Her other works include the short story collection The Art of Dying(1993); the novels The Ghosts of Vasu Master (1994), When Dreams Travel (1999), In Times of Siege(2003), Fugitive Histories(2009) and I Have Become the Tide (2019) and a collection of essays entitled Almost Home: Cities and Other Places (2014). Hariharan has written children's stories and co-edited a collection for children called Sorry, Best Friend! (2012). She has also edited a collection of translated short fiction, A Southern Harvest (1993), the essay collection From India to Palestine: Essays in Solidarity (2014) and co-edited Battling for India: A Citizen’s Reader (2019).  Recent Work  Her recent novel I Have Become the Tide, published in 2019 in India, includes three distinctive narratives that intertwine past and present in compelling ways to raise an urgent voice against the cruelties of caste, and the destructive forces that crush dissent. But they also celebrate the joy of resistance, the redemptive beauty of words, and the courage to be found in friendship and love. I Have Become the Tide is deeply political, but it never loses sight of humour, tenderness—or the human spirit. Her recent edited book, Battling for India: A Citizen’s Reader(co- edited with Salim Yusufji) was published in 2019 by Speaking Tiger in India. The reader is a necessary collection that brings us the voices and experiences of those who are battling for India through their private struggles and public activism: Alivelamma, a woman farmer. Huchangi, Rohith, Ravan—poet, scholar, activist; all dalit. Sukalo, Rajkishor, Leelabati—activist, poet, singer; adivasis. Eighteen-year-old Muddu Thirthahalli and ninety-one-year-old Nayantara, both writers; Amarjeet, Sonia and 2000 others gathered at a workers’ rally. Salima, Hafiz, Aslah, who refuse to be second-class citizens. Among them, and with them, are the voices of journalists, artists, teachers and students. Together, they speak to us of the many ways in which state and extra-state forces have been excluding more and more citizens from India. Together, they show us ways to re-make the nation envisioned by our Constitution—a nation whose people can, without exception, live as free and equal citizens. Early life Githa Hariharan was born in Coimbatore, India, and she grew up in Bombay and Manila. She was educated in these two cities and later in the United States. She got a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree in English Literature and Psychology from Bombay University in 1974; and a Master of Arts in Communications from the Graduate School of Corporate and Political Communication, Fairfield University, Connecticut, 1977. She worked as a staff writer in WNET-Channel 13 in New York, and from 1979 to 1984, she worked as an editor in the Mumbai, Chennai and New Delhi offices of Orient Longman, where she was responsible for the social science, fiction and women's studies lists. From 1985 to 2005, she worked as a freelance professional editor for a range of academic institutions and foundations. She is, at present, a writer based in New Delhi. In 1995, Hariharan challenged the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act as discriminatory against women. The case, Githa Hariharan and Another vs. Reserve Bank of India and Another, led to a Supreme Court judgment in 1999 on guardianship. Career Hariharan first worked in the Public Broadcasting System in New York and then with a publishing firm as an editor in India.Hariharan, Githa 1954 -. (1999). In The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English She is currently, a full-time writer.http://www.rigzin.freeservers.com/indoanglianlit3.htm Hariharan's fiction has been translated into a number of languages including French, Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, Greek, Urdu and Vietnamese; her essays and fiction have also been included in anthologies such as Salman Rushdie's Mirrorwork: 50 Years of Indian Writing 1947-1997. She wrote a monthly column for many years on different aspects of culture and their political and social underpinnings, in The Telegraph, Kolkata. She has been Visiting Professor or Writer-in-Residence in several universities, including Dartmouth College and George Washington University in the United States, the University of Canterbury at Kent in the UK, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, and in India, Jamia Millia Islamia and Goa University. Hariharan is also a founder member of the Indian Writers’ Forum, a public trust set up to promote Indian diversity and freedom of expression; and address, through discussion, debate and participation in public events and campaigns, current issues in the overlapping practice of culture, academics, art and politics. The Forum runs two sites, the Indian Cultural Forum which focuses on cultural politics; and Guftugu, an online journal that showcases diverse cultural, artistic and academic practice in India. Gita Hariharan's novels A Thousand Faces of Night (1992) and The Ghost of Vasu Master (1994) are concerned with rewriting folk tales and children's stories. In The Ghost of Vasu Master (1994) a retired schoolteacher, Vasu Master, succeeds in winning over the problem child Mani by storytelling. The stories are reworking of the Panchtantra. Vasu comes to recognize 'the necessity of reconstruction' from the dismantled parts of various ideas, beliefs, models' that are his inheritance. A Thousand Faces of Night deals with the positioning of Indian Women in relation to this orientalist idea of tradition. Hariharn herself returned to India after attending graduate school in the United States and this novel is an account of the foreign returned Devi's attempt to find aa way of living in contemporary India.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer affecting blood cells that eventually develop into non-lymphocyte white blood cells. The disease originates from the bone marrow, the soft inner portion of select bones where blood stem cells develop into either lymphocyte or in this particular condition, myeloid cells. This acute disease prevents bone marrow cells from properly maturing, thus causing an accumulation of immature myeloblast cells in the bone marrow. Acute myeloid leukemia is more lethal than chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease that affects the same myeloid cells, but at a different pace. Many of the immature blast cells in acute myeloid leukemia have a higher loss of function and thus, a higher inability to carry out normal functions than those more developed immature myeloblast cells in chronic myeloid leukemia (O’Donnell et al. 2012). Acute in acute myeloid leukemia means that the amounts of blast cells are increasing at a very high rate. Myeloid refers to the type of white blood cells that are affected by the condition. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common acute leukemia that is affecting the adult population. The 5-year survival rate for the cancer stands at around 26% (ACS, 2016). M2 acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation refers to the subtype of acute myeloid leukemia characterized by the maturation stages of the myeloid cell development and the location of the AML1 gene. One of the hallmarks of M2 subtype acute myeloid leukemia is the formation of a fusion protein, AML1-ETO or RUNX1-RUNX1T1, due to a translocation of chromosome 8 to chromosome 21 or t(8;21) (Miyoshi et al., 1991, Andrieu et al., 1996). This cytogenetic abnormality has been found in 90% of M2 acute myeloblastic leukemia; while the other 10% constitutes a mix of M1 and M4 acute myeloid leukemia (GFHC, 1990). Another translocation between chromosome 6p23 and chromosome 9q34 is also associated with the M2 subtype. The t(6;9) causes the formation of a fusion oncogene made of DEK (6p23) and CAN/NUP214 (9q34). This rare translocation has a poor prognosis compared to the t(8;21) because 70% of t(6;9) acute myeloid leukemia patients have the FLT3-ITD mutation (Schwartz et al., 1983, Kottaridis, 2001). The FLT- ITD mutation is one of the most lethal mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (Chi et al., 2008). M2 acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation, as classified by the FAB system, constitutes 25% of adult AML (Wiki Main article: AML). Cause This subtype is characterized by a translocation of a part of chromosome 8 to chromosome 21, written as t(8;21). On both sides of the splice the DNA coded for different proteins, RUNX1 and ETO, These two sequences are then transcribed and translated into a single large protein, \\"M2 AML\\" which allows the cell to divide unchecked, leading to cancer. Genetics Acute myeloid leukemia is a very heterogeneous disease, composed of a variety of translocations and mutations. However, one tenth of all acute myeloid leukemia cases diagnosed have the AML1-ETO fusion oncoprotein due to the t(8;21) translocation. AML1 or RUNX1 is a DNA-binding transcription factor located at the 21q22. ETO is a protein with transcriptional repressing abilities located at the 8q22. Less than 1% of acute myeloid leukemia patients have the t(6;9) mutation. The rare translocation causes the formation of fusion oncoprotein DEK-NUP214 (Huret, 2005). DEK functions as a transcriptional repressor by interfering with histone acetyl transferases, regulator for a number of stem cells, and activates gene expression in myeloid cells (Koleva et al., 2012). The NUP214 protein is involved in mRNA export as well as nuclear membrane localization and nuclear pore complex (Koser et al., 2011). Molecular mechanism Figure 1. Overview of major interaction with tumor suppressor p14ARF and downstream effects of fusion protein AML1-ETO in M2 acute myeloid leukemia. Elimination of the tumor suppressor ARF gene is often seen in cancer cells. In adult M2 acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation, ARF expression is suppressed via chromosome translocations that fuse AML1 or Runx1 to an ETO gene. The AML1 or Runx1 gene is in charge of activating transcription of the ARF gene while the ETO protein is involved in transcriptional repression. The AML1-ETO fusion protein ultimately causes transcriptional repression of the p14ARF gene, which deregulates the expression levels of Mdm2 and p53. The down regulation of ARF, increases Mdm2 levels due to the lack of regulation by the ARF gene. Unregulated, overexpressed Mdm2 will suppress p53 levels. The suppression of p53 levels is an anti-apoptotic mechanism for cancer cells to survive (Elagib, 2006, Weinberg, 2014).The fusion oncoprotein involves the gene AML1 (now known as RUNX1) and ETO (now known as RUNX1T1). AML1, located at the 21q22, normally has the ability to activate transcription of the ARF gene and ETO, located at the 8q22, normally has the ability to repress transcription. The fusion protein AML1-ETO is commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia patients. p14ARF is a well known tumor suppressor that serves as the safety net when p53 tumor suppressor's functions are inhibited. Many cancers recognize the potential of the p14ARF tumor suppressor to block cell growth so it is commonly mutated or inhibited in cancer cells. The AML1-ETO is incapable of p14ARF transcription as the fusion protein took on AML1's involvement with ARF gene expression and ETO's transcription repression. The Akt/PKB signaling is a pathway that is pro-survival and growth. By activating Mdm2, the signal transduction pathway will trigger the anti-apoptotic downstream effects of Mdm2. With no p14ARF to regulate and inhibit Mdm2, there will be an increased level of suppression of p53. Mdm2 is a proto-oncogene that directly antagonizes p53 to ubiquitination (Figure 1). The p53 protein is known as the “guardian of the genome” due to its ability to induce DNA repair enzymes and regulate cell cycle advancements. The down regulation of p53 by Mdm2 would lead to unchecked proliferative growth. The direct consequence of having the fusion protein, AML1-ETO, is the lack of p53 regulation in pre-leukemic cells. Therefore, there are an increased number of immature cells that are unable to carry out normal function, which is essentially cancer (Faderi et al., 2000, Song et al. 2005, Weinberg, 2014). Autophagy in M2 AML Autophagy is an innate pathway used for degradation of cellular components (Kobayashi, 2015). In recent studies, scientists recognize the significance of autophagy both as a potential anti-apoptotic response to cancer treatments as well as a potential mechanism for getting rid of undesirable fusion proteins such as AML1-ETO. In a 2013 study, scientists demonstrated that the degradation of fusion oncoprotein AML1-ETO is not mediated by autophagy through a set of drug dosage trials testing the levels of AML1-ETO protein expression. The acute myeloid leukemia Kasumi-1 cell line was selected for the experiment due to its AML1-ETO positive characteristics. These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of each histone deacetylase inhibitors – valproic acid (VPA) (epileptic and bipolar drug) or vorinostat (cutaneous T cell lymphoma drug), which are known to induce autophagy associated with loss of the fusion protein. The two inhibitors were added to the cell line in doses of 0, 0.38 uM, 0.74 uM, and 1.5 uM. The cell lysates were then treated with autophagy inhibitors Baf or CQ, or control. Through immunoblotting, there is no reduction of AML1-ETO observed across the different concentrations of VPA or vorinostat. The results indicate that AML1-ETO degradation is not mediated by autophagy, but there is an observed pro-survival autophagy in the leukemic cells (Torgersen et al., 2013). Thus, an inhibition of autophagy would be a viable treatment method for subtype M2 acute myeloid leukemia. Diagnosis The first red flag that indicates M2 acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation is the skewed ratio of white blood cells to red blood cells. Leukemia is initially diagnosed by a peripheral blood smear, a procedure used to check for cell count and cell shapes. Then a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy would be conducted to collect and view the bone, bone marrow, and blood under a microscope. Cytogenetic assays, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) would help evaluate the structure and function of the cell's chromosomes. The criteria for an acute myeloid leukemia case to fall under the M2 subtype is the following: 20%+ nonerythroid cells in peripheral blood or bone marrow are myeloblasts; monocytic precursors are < 20% in bone marrow and granulocytes are 10%+ of cells (Mihova, 2013). Treatments Generally, acute myeloid leukemia is treated using chemotherapy consisting of an induction phase and consolidation phase (Dohner et al., 2009). Patients may also consider hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a second mode of tackling the cancer. The most novel research is being done in tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however M2 acute myeloid leukemia treatment research involves molecules that inhibit the fusion oncoprotein AML1-ETO. Therefore, in terms of M2 subtype acute myeloid leukemia, the most prominent target is the abnormal AML1-ETO fusion protein. Similarly, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is comparable to acute myeloid leukemia M2 because it also forms a fusion oncoprotein – BCR-Abl. The developed tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, has had a tremendous effect on stopping cancer progression in the majority of chronic myeloid leukemia patients. BCR-Abl is constitutively active due chromosome translocation; therefore it over-phosphorylates the tyrosine kinase. Imatinib mesylate works to block BCR-Abl's activity by blocking the active kinase domain (Fava et al., 2011). Celastrol is a compound extracted from Tripterygium wilfordii that has anti-cancer properties. It was found to inhibit cell proliferation through the down regulation of AML1-ETO fusion oncoprotein. Celastrol inhibits the fusion oncoprotein by inducing mitochondrial instability and initiating caspase activity The decrease of AML1-ETO also results in lower levels of C-KIT kinases, Akt/PKB, STAT3, and Erk1/2 – all of which are involved in cell signaling and gene transcription (Yu et al., 2016). Histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid (VPA), vorinostat, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are effective in targeting acute myeloid leukemia with the AML1-ETO fusion protein. The HDAC inhibitors are known to induce apoptosis through accumulation of DNA damage, inhibition of DNA repair, and activation of caspases. These inhibitors are extra sensitive to the fusion proteins. Vorinostat has been proven to cause a greater accumulation of DNA damage in fusion protein expressing cells and is directly correlated with the reduction of DNA repair enzymes (Garcia et al., 2008). Romidepsin, a drug in phase two clinical trials, has demonstrated higher efficacy in patients with AML1-ETO fusion protein leukemia (Odenike et al., 2008). Although many clinical evaluations have proven HDAC inhibitors have a promising effect on M2 subtype acute myeloid leukemia, it has not been approved as an official treatment. In t(6;9) acute myeloid leukemia, FLT3-ITD and the DEK-NUP214 protein are potential targets for treatment. Sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor used as a treatment for kidney and liver cancer. The kinase inhibitor blocks serine-threonine kinase RAF-1 as well as FLT-ITD (Kindler, 2010). The drug has been proven to be effective in reducing FLT3-ITD overexpression (Metzelder et al., 2009). In patients with DEK-NUP214, it was found that the fusion oncoprotein caused an upregulation of mTORC1 (Sanden et al., 2013). Thus, a mTORC inhibitor could be a potential treatment.

He is best known for helping to spread William Tyndale's New Testament and for writing the vehemently anti-clerical pamphlet Supplication for the Beggars (A Supplycacion for the Beggars) which the Roman Catholic Church condemned as heretical on 24 May 1530. His pamphlet can be seen as a precursor to the English Reformation and the Protestant Reformation. Fish was eventually arrested in London on charges of heresy, but he was stricken with bubonic plague and died before he could stand trial. His widow married vocal reformer James Bainham, and then became a widow again in April 1532 when Bainham was burned at the stake as a heretic. Supplication for the Beggars Fish wrote his incendiary pamphlet Supplication for the Beggars during his second exile in Antwerp. The 16-page pamphlet accused the Roman Catholic Church of everything from avarice to murder to treason. Johannes Grapheus of Antwerp was probably the printer, but that is unconfirmed. The Supplication was smuggled into England from Antwerp, penetrating the country's borders despite its prohibition. Fish had dedicated it to King Henry VIII. According to John Foxe, Fish's Supplication arrived in England on 2 February 1529. Economic Argument Fish's pamphlet cries out to the king on behalf of the poor and accuses the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy of increasing their miseries. > Most lamentably compleyneth theyre wofull mysery vnto youre highnes youre > poore daily bedemen the wretched hidous monstres (on whome scarcely for > horror any yie dare loke) the foule vnhappy sort of lepres, and other sore > people, needy, impotent, blinde, lame, and sike that live onely by almesse, > howe that theyre nombre is daily so sore encreased that all the almesse of > all the weldisposed people of this youre realme is not half ynough for to > susteine theim, but that for verey contreint they die for hunger.Fish, > Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. > Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. > New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),1. Fish argues that the clergy and the Roman Catholic Church hold a disproportionate share of England's resources, alleging that they hold half of England's wealth while only representing 1/100 of the male population and only 1/400 of the total population. The monasteries, he claims, further compound the Church's corruption by heaping taxes on the poor instead of helping them. Fish calculates that the English clergy own 1/3 of the land and 1/10 of all farm produce and live stock, and simultaneously receive 1/10 of all servants' wages within England. The pamphlet finds that, if there were ten households for each of the 52,000 parish churches in England, then just one of five orders of mendicant friars alone would take in an annual £43.333 6s. 8de. These economic arguments compose the bulk of his pamphlet's claims, and they might have gained further strength because an economic crisis had crippled all of Europe by 1529. Theological Argument Fish's pamphlet also lodges specific theological objections against the Roman Catholic Church. His two principal arguments contest the existence of purgatory and the sale of indulgences. =Against the Doctrine of Purgatory= Fish expends few words on theological matters. With regard to purgatory, he simply contends that \\"there is not one word spoken of hit in al holy scripture\\", making an argument in line with the Reformation idea of Sola Scriptura. To contest the doctrine of purgatory, he continues to state that \\"we have no command from God to pray for the dead\\".Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),8. Beyond these statements, however, Fish furnishes no further details in defence of his position. Fish also rejects the sale of indulgences and argues that the supposed act of penance was merely a ruse to fill the clergy's coffers. > They sey also that if there were a purgatory, and also if that the pope with > his pardons for money may deliuer one soule thens: he may deluer him aswel > without money: if he may deliuer one, he may deliuer a thousand: yf he may > deluer a thousand he may deliuer theim all, and so destroy purgatory. And > then is he a cruell tyraunt without all charitie if he kepe theim there in > prison and in paine till men will giue him money.Fish, Simon. Supplycacion > for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale > Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale > University Press, 1990),5. He calls all Catholic clerics \\"tyrauntes\\" who \\"lakke charite\\"Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),5–6. because they would withhold prayers for a person who could not pay for them. Anti-Clerical Argument Fish claims that the clergy is attempting to usurp the power of the state. At present, Fish holds that the power of the clergy has surpassed that of the state, creating their own sovereign, subversive state. Despite attempts by the state to enact laws to restrain the clergy, these laws remained ineffective. Fish references the ancient kings of the Britons, likely in an attempt to play off of Henry's own Welsh background. These kings, Fish explains, never allowed themselves to be subjugated by the clergy or assent to taxation by foreign representatives. Rather, they kept a firm hand on such external powers. Fish explains that it was thanks to “so many clerical parasites among them as now infest the realm of England”Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),7.

The Supplycacion warns Henry that should he fail to meet the needs of the poor, they will rise up against as they did with King John. =Anti-Clerical Charges: The Case of Richard Hunne= To make his anti-clerical case, Fish cites the case of Richard Hunne, which at the time was a sensational story. It is not surprising, then, that in More's response to Fish's historical claims, the Hunne scandal merited more ink than any of Fish's other historical contention. The controversy began in 1514 when Hunne, a wealthy Londoner, refused to pay a burial fee to his parish priest for the burial of Hunne's child. The priest sued Hunne in ecclesiastical court; Hunne counter-sued, insisting that the case fell within the jurisdictional purview of common law, not ecclesiastical law. Upon filing his suit, Hunne was seized on charges of heresy and taken to the Bishop of London's prison. Hunne was found two days later in his cell, dead, hanging by a rope. The clergy claimed Hunne had committed suicide, but the coroner's investigation found signs of foul play. The evidence later collected suggested that the chancellor of the Bishop of London, Dr. Horsey, was responsible for the death. Dr. Horsey, however, never stood trial because the Bishop of London obtained a royal pardon on his behalf. Fish uses this incident to argue that the clergy used the brand of heresy to persecute.Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),9. =Anti-Clerical Charges: Treachery and Corruption= Fish's pamphlet declares the clergy treasonous and corrupt. The clergy, according to Fish, levy crippling taxes that sap the population of funds they could otherwise use to support the king and finance defence measures. Moreover, the clergy themselves are excluded from the government's tax base. The clergy's resulting largess provides them with the requisite power to oppose the king, which Fish dubs the clergy's “treason fund.”Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),3. This charge of treason against the clergy, according to the pamphlet, is rooted in fact that the clergy have “placed themselves above the law of the realm.”Fish, Simon. Supplycacion for the Beggar. 1529 in Carroll, Gerald L. and Joseph B. Murray. The Yale Edition of the Complete Works of St. Thomas More. Vol. 7. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),10. The mere existence of ecclesiastical courts is another sign of this treason. Hunne was murdered, Fish maintains, because he properly recognise the king's authority as existing above that of the clergy. As for the clergy's corruption, Fish launches an assault against the clergy based upon their inability to marry. His pamphlet asserts that this requirement moves the clergy, with their expendable wealth, to entice women to lead lives of sin. > \\"By all the sleyghtes they may to haue to do with euery mannes wife, euery > mannes daughter, and euery mannes mayde, that cukkoldrie and baudrie shulde > reigne ouer all among your sibiectres, that noman shoulde knowe his owne > childe, that theyre bastardes…These be they that by theire absteyning from > marriage do let the generation of the people whereby all the realme at > length if it should be continued shall be made desert and inhabitable.\\" Fish's shocking claims continue with arguments that priests’ deplorable sexual promiscuity spreads diseases thereby corrupting “the hole generation of mankind yn your realme, that catche the pokes of one woman,” and who “catch the lepry of one woman, and bere it to an other…” Supplycatyon of Soulys: St. Thomas More’s Response to Simon Fish Within months of the circulation of Fish's pamphlet, St. Thomas More produced a response in defence of the Catholic Church, entitled The Supplycatyon of Soulys. The response, printed by October 1529, came in two books, the first addressing the social and economic concerns raised by Fish, and the second defending the doctrine of purgatory. More's lengthy, legalistic and logic-driven response was ten-times longer than Fish's sixteen-page pamphlet. Fish's Legacy Fish's legacy continues through his famous pamphlet. Its repeated printings, either despite or because of its banned status, show the sustained interest in the piece throughout the sixteenth-century. After its initial circulation, the Supplycacion is known to have been reprinted five times in the nineteenth century and twice in the twentieth century, not counting its repeated inclusion in various editions of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments that reach up into the present. Fish's propagandistic pamphlet functioned within a broader, international clash that entangled politics and religion. Joining in a growing anti-clerical movement, Fish's pamphlet, however inflammatory, demonstrates some of the popular objections to the Roman Catholic Church in the years preceding the English Reformation.

It followed from their manifesto commitment made during the 1997 general election campaign to impose a \\"windfall levy\\" on the privatised utilities. The tax came after 18 years of Conservative government, which had seen the privatization of many state-owned assets, at prices which many considered too low. It aimed to \\"put right the bad deal which customers and taxpayers got from the privatisation of the utilities\\". The tax produced an estimated one off income to the government of £5 billion, which was used to fund the New Deal, a welfare-to-work program that sought to tackle long-term unemployment, as well as providing capital investment for schools and the University for Industry (Learndirect).  The tax  The tax was calculated by means of a 9 times P/E ratio, whereby the average post-tax profit in the four years after privatization was multiplied by 9 to give the value for the purposes of the tax. The difference between this value and the total market capitalisation based on the company's flotation price was subject to a 23% \\"windfall tax\\". The tax was charged to the company and was payable in two instalments on 1 December 1997 and 1 December 1998. The companies affected were those privatized by the Telecommunications Act 1984, the Airports Act 1986, the Gas Act 1986, the Water Act 1989, the Electricity Act 1989 (and the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992) and the Railways Act 1993. The firms affected were BAA, British Energy, British Gas (now BG plc and Centrica), British Telecom, National Power, Northern Ireland Electricity, Powergen, Scottish Hydro, Scottish Power and Railtrack, the regional electricity companies and the privatized water and sewerage companies (including such companies now forming part of Hyder, United Utilities and Scottish Power). Since 1997, no further windfall taxes have been levied in the UK. However, calls have been made for new windfall taxes. The Financial Times reported in January 2008 that the government was considering ways of maximising returns to the treasury from the sale of the troubled Northern Rock bank, which could include a windfall tax or the government taking an equity stake. In the event, the bank was not sold on to private investors, but instead came under UK government ownership. It was returned to the private sector in the 2010s.  Windfall tax on energy companies  Calls were made for a windfall tax on energy companies during the summer of 2008 in the wake of energy price rises and the environmental record of the oil and gas industry. 120 Labour MPs supported the call, as well as columnist for The Guardian newspaper Polly Toynbee and the left-wing pressure group Compass. There were conflicting reports in the media over whether the government was looking into implementing the tax, with suggestions that government ministers were both interested in and opposed to the idea. Despite the BBC later reporting in early September that such a windfall tax was \\"still an option\\", then Prime Minister Gordon Brown confirmed at the Labour Party conference later that month that the idea had been scrapped. The issue was raised again in 2013, led by former Prime Minister John Major, who described the recent energy price rises of more than 10% \\"unacceptable\\", calling for a one-off emergency tax. 2019 Labour proposal for windfall tax A windfall tax on oil and gas companies featured in the Labour manifesto in the 2019 general election.

In addition to copper domestic coins, silver coins were made for some of the colonies, and various trade tokens and medals were struck.Old and New Birmingham: A History of the Town and its People, Robert Kirkup Dent, Published by Houghton and Hammond, Scotland Passage, Birmingham, 1880 Among the medals produced were the Seringapatam medal, made for the East India Company in 1801–2 to reward participants of the Battle of Seringapatam, and a medal for the Battle of Trafalgar, which Matthew Boulton produced at his own expense and gave to all those present at the 1805 battle.

Soho mint mark (the word 'SOHO' below-right of the shield) on a cartwheel twopence In order to differentiate his proposed copper coins from counterfeits Boulton specified them as follows: ;twopence: weight, diameter 8 to the foot () ;penny:, diameter 17 to two feet () ;half- penny:, diameter 10 to a foot () ;farthing:, diameter 12 to a foot () Cartwheel twopence coins made at the Soho Mint in 1797. Their weight in pure copper should be so close to the intrinsic value of the material that counterfeiting would be uneconomic. The diameter was made strictly defined by striking within a collar so that diameter, thickness and weight could be used to prove the quality of the metal. In 1797 the first, and only, copper twopence and the first penny coins were produced under contract although the smaller denominations did not follow until later.British Coins Market Values, Link House Magazines Ltd, 1993, These coins were comparatively large, having a broad raised rim with the inscription pressed below the surface and became known as the cartwheel pennies.

It is a famous Norwich landmark and features the Briton's Arms coffee house, The Stranger's Club, Pettus House (Elm Hill Collectables),The Tea House (in Wrights Court) and the Dormouse Bookshop. It has been used as a location for television and film productions, most notably for the 2007 film StardustFilm locations Retrieved 6 November 2011 and also Netflix's 2020 film Jingle Jangle. All we know so far about Netflix’s Jingle Jangle filmed in Norwich History= Toponymy  Elm Hill acquired its name from the elm trees that have successively stood in the square since the first quarter of the 16th century when the Churchwardens of St Peter Hungate Church planted the first one. (The tree you see today is not an elm because of the presence of Dutch elm disease in the UK). The parish pump, though not the original, is sited near the tree.  First mention  There is no record of the date when Elm Hill first came into being, but there is some evidence for its existence around 1200. Very few buildings now standing in Elm Hill are of an earlier date than 1507, when a disastrous fire destroyed over 700 houses in Norwich. The Britons Arms was the only building to survive, so is much older. Elm Hill used to continue in a straight line past Britons Arms and intersect with St Georges Street but was re-aligned in the 15th century to permit the construction of St Andrew's & Blackfriars Halls which were originally the home of the Dominican friars. Elm Hill today extends from the Church of St. Peter Hungate where the top of Elm Hill meets Princes Street, to the Church of St. Simon and St. Jude, sited at the bottom of Elm Hill on the corner with Wensum Street. Although it may not be immediately apparent today, the North side of Elm Hill runs parallel to the river Wensum and in the past many of the merchant houses had their own quays. During the 15th and 16th centuries Elm Hill and the river were important commercial thoroughfares. The river was the route from which raw materials were imported and finished products exported via Great Yarmouth. At this time there was industrial prosperity in Norwich due largely to the arrival of religious refugees from Europe and the settlement of a large number of weavers, dyers, goldsmiths and other skilled craftsmen. Many wealthy merchants had their houses facing Elm Hill with their factories and workshops at the rear. Between them and the river were the homes of their workpeople. Elm Hill has provided sixteen recorded citizens to serve Norwich as Mayor or Sheriff.  Potential demolition in 1926  With the gradual decline of Norwich as a centre of the weaving industry in the 19th century, Elm Hill lost its importance and slowly degenerated into a slum area. By 1926 where once stood the fine houses of the merchants there was only neglect and decay. The areas leading down to the river, whilst still inhabited, were scenes of poverty and squalor. The Norwich Corporation wanted to demolish and build a swimming pool on the north side of the street but at the last moment was persuaded to adopt the ideas from the Norwich Society. In 1927 the Norwich Society, carried out a detailed survey and report on Elm Hill, forwarding this, with their recommendations, to the Norwich Corporation for their consideration. The report made it clear that despite the shocking condition of the Elm Hill area there still remained much of historic and architectural value and that with a general clearance of the slums, and sympathetic renovation of some of the more important buildings, it could once again become an important area of interest. Renovation work commenced in 1927. The Corporation purchased some of the properties, the slums were largely demolished and further purchases were made after the war. Today, with a few exceptions, Norwich City Council still owns most the buildings.  Norwich keyboard  The keyboard artwork In 1999, Molly Sole, then a student at the Norwich School of Art and Design, created a \\"fossilized keyboard\\" as an art project. It is located on the corner of Princes Street and Elm Hill. The artwork sparked several urban legends, from being the impression of a keyboard that fell into the fresh cement of the pavement in the 1980s, to being the remains of a typewriter.

Distribution and habitat  Monomorium antarcticum is endemic to New Zealand, found across the North and South Islands, as well as Stewart Island and smaller offshore islands, the Three Kings Islands, the Chatham Islands, the Kermandec Islands and the Austral Islands. Monomorium antarcticum are found throughout many habitats including native forest, grasslands, wetlands, pastureland, household gardens as well as horticultural and industrial habitats. There is some evidence to suggest that the range of Monomorium antarcticum in urban habitats may be restricted due to competition with exotic ant species, at least in northern parts of New Zealand.  Identification  Worker specimens are variable in size, usually 3-5mm in length, with head width varying from 0.60-0.88mm. The antennae have 12 segments, with a three segmented club. Metanotal groove present, either distinctly or weakly impressed. Spines on propodeum are either blunt or absent. Colour highly variable across colonies (but usually consistent within colonies), from orange, light to dark brown and black. References This Myrmicinae-related article is a stub.

It is thought to be unique in being the only such trading hall in Northern Europe to be owned by one man. The building stands on what was the main road through the city in the fifteenth century, with river transport links via Great Yarmouth to the Low Countries. Dragon Hall is now acknowledged as one of Norwich’s medieval architectural gems and an iconic building in the city. The Great Hall on the first floor was built in the 15th century, but some parts of the site are older. Archaeological research shows evidence of an Anglo-Saxon hut 1000 beneath the Hall. On the northern part of the site, in the late 13th century, the abbey at Woburn, Bedfordshire had a fish processing operation with various outbuildings and a track to a staithe or quay. There was also a boundary wall with a large brick arch to give access to King Street. In about 1330 an L-shaped domestic 'hall house' owned by John Page was built on the southern part of the site with an undercroft and an entrance on the south side from Old Barge Yard. In about 1427 Robert Toppes, a Norwich merchant, re-developed the site as a commercial complex. He built his first floor trading hall on top of part of the 14th century domestic hall house and on top of the existing boundary wall and brick arch. He retained the 14th century entrance to the hall house for his customers. From the entrance passage his customers went up a new staircase to the first floor trading hall. This was a timber construction of seven bays with a crown post roof, decorated with carvings in the spandrels of 14 dragons. The hall was constructed with English oak, using some 1,000 trees. At the rear of the building he created a yard space with access to the river for his imports and exports, a warehouse area under the hall and a new stairway down to the extended undercroft from the yard. Part of the hall house was retained as a ground floor reception area. Robert Toppes Little is known of Robert Toppes, who during the 1420s bought the land where Dragon Hall now stands. He was an exporter of worsted and an importer of finished textiles, iron goods, wine and spices. He rose to become an important figure in the politics of the city of Norwich, becoming the city's Treasurer before he was 30, and later becoming Sheriff. He became mayor on four separate occasions and represented the city as its member of parliament four times. He was involved a disputed election which resulted in him exiled to Bristol. and was indicted in the aftermath of the 'Gladman's Insurrection'. Toppes' second wife, Joan Knyvett was related to the Pastons, who were linked with the Paston Letters. He owned numerous properties throughout East Anglia. He paid for a large stained-glass window in the church of St Peter Mancroft, panels of which have survived. When he died in 1467, he provided priests to pray for his soul, paying for this by the sale of his property on King Street. 1467 to 1960s After being sold in 1467, the hall was gradually divided into smaller and smaller houses, and the original bay windows were replaced with doors and sash windows. The internal structure was redesigned, with the insertion of new floors and cellars. The building became known as the Old Barge Building, named after the nearby pub. Poor quality housing built up around the spaces adjoining the building. By the 19th century some 150 people were known be living there. In 1937 a Slum Clearance programme was implemented, which removed most of the slum housing at the back of the site. By the 1950s the front of the hall building looking onto King Street had been adapted for use as a butcher's shop, with a rectory situated behind it, and the Old Barge pub at the southern end. In 1954 the building it was warded Listed Building status: Grade 1. Restoration 1970s to 2006 Following deeper examination by the Norwich Survey, based at the University of East Anglia, architectural historians and other interested people realised that the building was of great historical importance and a committee was set up to restore the hall. In 1979 Norwich City Council bought the building which was by then uninhabited and a major programme of fund raising, restoration and research began. The Norfolk and Norwich Heritage Trust was formed to run the hall; partition walls, attic floors, chimneys and fireplaces were removed and the hall was restored to something like its original state. In 1986 it was renamed as 'Dragon Hall' and became a heritage attraction, a resource for the local community and an educational centre. In 1997/98 there was a major archaeological investigation of the area behind the Hall. Following a major Heritage Lottery Fund grant in 2005/06, further improvements were made, including the addition of a north wing with displays, a lift, offices, a kitchen and a meeting room. The National Centre for Writing In 2015 the lease of the premises was taken over by the Writers’ Centre Norwich, and in 2016 the Norfolk and Norwich Heritage Trust was wound up. In 2018 the Writers Centre Norwich became the National Centre for Writing, and they added a new North Wing with extensive office and meeting spaces. An existing 19th century cottage on the site was also converted as a residential facility for visiting writers and translators. The Dragon Hall Volunteers were re-constituted as the Dragon Hall Heritage Volunteers and they continue to act as tour guides, to give external talks to local clubs and societies and to act as guardians and promoters of the heritage of Dragon Hall by the creation of an on-line archive of documents and photographs. They also have a Local History Study Group and a Mummers group. Public access Bookable, guided tours of Dragon Hall are normally available twice a month. On the Heritage Open Days in September, additional tours have in previous years been organised, and special tours and bookings by groups can also be arranged.

Built between 1398 and 1399 by the city authorities in response to the threat from France and indigenous English rebels, the tower was intended to defend the north-eastern approach to Norwich with hand cannons and bombards. It stood apart from the main city walls, close to the river where its height would have allowed it to fire onto the higher ground opposite the city. The tower was designed to hold a garrison when required and was well furnished, probably using different floors for dining and sleeping. It was maintained throughout the 15th century, and played a role in Kett's Rebellion of 1549, when the rebels attacked Norwich, deploying artillery and damaging the tower's parapets. Repairs to the tower's walls in the late 19th century inadvertently caused long-term damage, and in 1953 it was taken into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who stabilised its condition in a five- year conservation project. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof of the building have been lost. The circular tower is across, high and divided into three storeys. Its walls are thick at the base, with a core of flint stone, faced on the inside and outside with brick; the archaeologist T. P. Smith considers it to feature some \\"of the finest medieval brickwork\\" in England. The walls have gunports for the smaller pieces of artillery and the roof would have supported the heavier bombards, with wide embrasures giving the weapons adequate firing space. The Cow Tower was specially designed to support the use of gunpowder artillery, making it a very rare structure in England for this period: the only close equivalents are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. History=14th century Cow Tower is an artillery tower that was built in the city of Norwich, Norfolk, England, between 1398 and 1399. Norwich was a prosperous city in the late 14th century, with a population of around 5,000 involved in key medieval industries and forming a centre for international trade.; Between 1297 and 1350 the city had erected a circuit of defensive stone walls and ditches, both to impress upon outsiders the status of Norwich as a great city, but also to defend against invasion or civil disorder.; Fears grew about the threat of French raids across England from the 1380s onward.; The citizens of Norwich were particularly concerned about the potential of a French raid on the city, drawing parallels between the position of Norwich and the experience of Southampton, another trading city that had been devastated by a French attack in 1338. This threat, combined with the recent events of the Peasant Revolt of 1381 when the rebels had looted the city, encouraged the local government to improve the city's defences.; ; The interior of the tower, showing the various gunports Gunpowder weapons had begun to be introduced into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and city walls was well understood and specialised facilities had begun to be built.; Norwich had acquired gunpowder weapons and a team of gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty gunpowder pieces for use along its city walls. Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards. The tower was built on one of the approaches to Norwich in a bend in the River Wensum, in a meadow called Cowholme, from where it acquired its current name.; When first built, however, it was initially called the Dungeon, and then the \\"tower in the Hospital meadows\\", as the surrounding land was part of the St Giles Hospital. It was intended to function as a specialised artillery tower, housing gunpowder weaponry capable of suppressing attackers on the far side of the river. The Wensum was quite narrow at this point, however, and the tower's defences would have been of relatively limited value if the enemy successfully crossed over.; There are fragmentary historical references to an earlier tower in the area, responsible for collecting tolls and acting as a prison, but it is unclear if this was on the same site as the Cow Tower, or refers to a different tower in the area.; The Cow Tower was one of several fortifications along this stretch of the river, with the gatehouse of Bishop Bridge lying just to the south, followed by two boom towers that controlled access to the waterway a further down-river, and with another tower positioned up-river to the north. Although the Cow Tower was not directly part of the city walls, a protective timber palisade linked the tower with the line of the city wall to the north-west, and ran south to meet Bishop Bridge. The city's accounts show the details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 bricks, stone, sand, lime, a hoist and various equipment.; At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the bricks may have been brought to the site along the river by boat, while some of the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth.; ; The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of bricks used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some bricks on the location before the build.; 15th–16th centuries bombards and stone cannonballs from the early 15th century Cow Tower formed part of the city defences during the 15th century, with the Crown occasionally issuing instructions that it should be repaired. In 1450 St Giles Hospital formally transferred any rights they had to the tower and the immediately surrounding land to the city. The population of Norwich grew significantly from 1500 onwards and the city continued to maintain the urban defences; like other towers and gatehouses belonging to the city, however, by this period the Cow Tower was probably leased out to a merchant or craftsman when not in military use.; In 1549, Robert Kett led an uprising in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east side of the river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, in an attempt to take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he turned on the Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower does not seem to have required extensive repairs. 17th–21st centuries Most of Norwich's city walls, and all of the gatehouses, were demolished in the late 18th and 19th century as the city industrialised, but the Cow Tower avoided destruction. The tower was now owned by the Trustees of the Great Hospital, who carried out repairs to the structure in the late 19th century, and in 1904, the British Army considered repairing the tower for use as an ammunition depot.; The repairs in the 19th century had used modern concrete when patching the walls, and this, combined with erosion from the river, soon caused extensive damage: wide splits formed up and down the tower along its northern side. The Ministry of Works took the tower into its guardianship in 1953 to address the problems, and promptly undertook an extensive sequence of repairs that lasted until 1958. No archaeological investigation was carried out during these works, however, and a full architectural survey of the building was only carried out between 1985 and 1986, by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission.; In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof have been lost. The tower is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument. Architecture Plan of the tower: (left to right) ground floor, first floor, second floor Cow Tower is a three- story circular building with a protruding turret, the main building being across and tall, tapering towards the top. Its walls, thick at the base, are made of a core of flint stone, faced on the inside and outside with brick, and various putlog holes can still be seen in the walls. The turret, which contained a spiral staircase, would originally have been higher than the parapets, forming a look-out position. The walls rest on a stone plinth and several layers of mortared flint. The bricks were probably made at the St Benet's Abbey in Norfolk, with the stone coming from chalk pits near Norwich's southern Conesford Gates. The brickwork, particularly on the stairwell, is particularly well executed, and archaeologist T. P. Smith considers the tower to feature some \\"of the finest medieval brickwork\\" in England. It is the earliest known use of brick in an external load-capacity in Norwich. The use of brick in this sort of fortification was both prestigious and practical, as brick absorbed the impact of artillery fire better than stone. The river bends around about from the bottom of the tower, and its base may have been underpinned with timber piles during its original construction. The Cow Tower was deliberately designed to house gunpowder artillery when it was first built, making it a very rare form of defensive structure for its time: the only equivalents in England are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. The archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham go so far as to consider the building to be unique within Britain, as God's House was an extension of an existing building, and the West Gate part of the city's walled circuit. The concept of an isolated artillery tower was more common in France, where they were used as temporary and permanent defensive features during the Hundred Years War between the English and the French kings. Chasing and sockets in the walls of the ground floor The quatrefoil gunports in the lower levels could have been used for both hand cannons and crossbows, with overlapping fields of fire. The roof was reinforced with large timber joints, and could have supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to reach across the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city.; ; Getting the bombards onto the roof may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399. The tower's gun installations were intended to be used to deal with an external threat approaching from the far side of the river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire.; The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected.; The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land. The tower was designed to be able to maintain a garrison when required and was well furnished.; The ground floor and second floor had fireplaces, with the first and second floors also having garderobes. The ground floor may have formed a dining area, with the floors above being used for military purposes and sleeping accommodation. The walls of the ground floor have chasing and sockets cut into them. It is unclear what these were: theories include that they contained timbers to support brickwork that in turn supported the first floor; that they were held timbers that supported the joists of the first floor; or they are the remains of an ammunition store, retrofitted in the tower in the 16th century.

Cajun Dance Party's debut album was entitled The Colourful Life, and released in April 2008. The band recorded the album sessions with Bernard Butler at the recording studio, West Heath Yard, owned by Edwyn Collins.
