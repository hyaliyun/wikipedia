The mill was founded along the Buttahatchee River in the 1840s, before being abandoned during the Civil War. James P. Pearce returned to the mill in 1865 and developed it into an economic center in the region. At its height in the 1870s, the complex hosted a general store with a post office, a gristmill, sawmill, flour mill, and cotton gin, in addition to the family house. Pearce's mule teams carried the mills' production to market in Tuscumbia. as improved roads and railroads drove commerce to Hamilton and other nearby towns, the store closed in 1930, and the mills ceased operation in 1959. See also: The mills were demolished in 1970 for safety reasons, however the dam and portions of the gristmill remain. The family home, built in 1878, was initially a two-room dogtrot structure. Rooms were added in the early 1900s and in 1916, a second floor was constructed. Stone fireplaces were added in the 1930s by the Works Progress Administration. Other remaining structures on the site include the two-story Victorian general store, built in the early 1870s; a tenant farmers' house; a former blacksmith shop; a barn; a shed; the family cemetery; and an abandoned bridge.

Daniel Coxe Jr. was appointed a member of the New Jersey Provincial Council on November 29, 1705 replacing the late Edward Hunloke.

In 1731, he claimed that he possessed superior title to that of the West Jersey Society, via a superseding deed that his father had recorded years earlier; the courts upheld Coxe's claim. Hundreds of families were forced to repurchase their own property from Col. Coxe or be forcibly evicted. The ensuing scandal was one of many injustices that inflamed American anger against the British during the years leading up the Revolutionary War. There were lawsuits and riots; Col. Coxe was burned in effigy; but to no avail. As a result, many Hopewell residents left New Jersey, either unable to pay Col. Coxe or disgusted with the colony's rampant political corruption. One group of Hopewell expatriates settled on the Yadkin River in what was then Rowan County, North Carolina. This community, the Jersey Settlement, continued to attract new settlers from the Hopewell area for several decades.

The game's music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu.  Gameplay  Players explore an Egyptian town and ruins from a first-person perspective. The game combines role-playing game elements with an adventure game-like interface. Players may purchase items from shops, though some shopkeepers must be defeated in battle before trading. Battles are turn-based, with options to fight, use items, or flee. Players accumulate experience points by succeeding in battle and \\"level up\\" after gaining enough experience, which increases their stamina. Randomly encountered battles with enemies may happen at any time, including when paused to examine the inventory.  Plot  The player character, Daisuke Kusano, is the son of an archaeologist who disappeared while searching for the Tears of Isis, artifacts once owned by Cleopatra. During the man's excavation for the Tears, demons appeared and abducted him. The boy soon learns that he must find the Tears in order to save his father. Over the course of the adventure, Daisuke visits the Great Sphinx of Giza, the Temple of Kom Ombo, a tower of sand, and an underground labyrinth. At the end of the game, he discovers that the demons had been disguised as the kindly shopkeeper. Daisuke receives the last Tear of Isis upon defeating the demons, which summons the ghost of Cleopatra, who releases Daisuke's father from imprisonment. Development Nobuo Uematsu composed the music for the game. When developing the game for both the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System (FDS), there were technical differences such as a smaller amount of memory on the FDS which led to a more difficult process creating the same graphics.  Reception  Famitsu appreciated the game's graphics and animations, and called the characters \\"cute\\". ITmedia Gamez also complimented the game's animations, though felt that too much of the disk's capacity was devoted to these animations at the cost of game length.

While working for the University of New Hampshire as a lecturer, Zhang submitted an article to the Annals of Mathematics in 2013 which established the first finite bound on the least gap between consecutive primes that is attained infinitely often. This work led to a 2014 MacArthur awardYitang Zhang, Mathematician, MacArthur Fellows Program, MacArthur Foundation, September 17, 2014 and his appointment as a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Education  Zhang was born in Pinghu, Zhejiang and lived there until he was 13 years old. At around the age of nine, he found a proof of the Pythagorean theorem. He first learned about Fermat‚Äôs last theorem and the Goldbach conjecture when he was 10. During the Cultural Revolution, he and his mother were sent to the countryside to work in the fields. He worked as a laborer for 10 years and was unable to attend high school. After the Cultural Revolution ended, Zhang entered Peking University in 1978 as an undergraduate student and received his B.S. degree in mathematics in 1982. He became a graduate student of Professor Pan Chengbiao, a number theorist at Peking University, and obtained his M.S. degree in mathematics in 1984. After receiving his master's degree in mathematics, with recommendations from Professor Ding Shisun, the President of Peking University, and Professor Deng Donggao, Chair of the university's Math Department, Zhang was granted a full scholarship at Purdue University. Zhang arrived at Purdue in January 1985, studied there for six and a half years, and obtained his Ph.D. in mathematics in December 1991.  Career  Zhang's Ph.D. work was on the Jacobian conjecture. After graduation, Zhang had a hard time finding an academic position. In a 2013 interview with Nautilus magazine, Zhang said he did not get a job after graduation. \\"During that period it was difficult to find a job in academics. That was a job market problem. Also, my advisor did not write me letters of recommendation.\\" Zhang made this claim again in George Csicsery‚Äôs documentary film Counting From Infinity while discussing his difficulties at Purdue and in the years that followed. Moh claimed that Zhang never came back to him requesting recommendation letters. In a detailed profile published in The New Yorker magazine in February 2015, Alec Wilkinson wrote Zhang \\"parted unhappily\\" with Moh, and that Zhang \\"left Purdue without Moh‚Äôs support, and, having published no papers, was unable to find an academic job\\". In 2018, responding to reports of his treatment of Zhang, Moh posted an update on his website. Moh wrote that Zhang \\"failed miserably\\" in proving Jacobian conjecture, \\"never published any paper on algebraic geometry\\" after leaving Purdue, and \\"wasted 7 years of his [Zhang's] own life and my [Moh's] time\\".https://www.math.purdue.edu/~ttm/ZhangYt.pdf After some years, Zhang managed to find a position as a lecturer at the University of New Hampshire, where he was hired by Kenneth Appel in 1999. Prior to getting back to academia, he worked for several years as an accountant and a delivery worker for a New York City restaurant. He also worked in a motel in Kentucky and in a Subway sandwich shop. A profile published in the Quanta Magazine reports that Zhang used to live in his car during the initial job-hunting days. He served as lecturer at UNH from 1999 until around January 2014, when UNH appointed him to a full professorship as a result of his breakthrough on prime numbers. Zhang stayed for a semester in Princeton University in 2014, and in Fall 2015, Zhang joined the University of California, Santa Barbara.http://dailynexus.com/2015-09-17/celebrity- mathematician-joins-ucsb-faculty/  Research  : On April 17, 2013, Zhang announced a proof that states there are infinitely many pairs of prime numbers that differ by 70 million or less. This result implies the existence of an infinitely repeatable prime 2-tuple, thus establishing a theorem akin to the twin prime conjecture. Zhang's paper was accepted by Annals of Mathematics in early May 2013, his first publication since his last paper in 2001. The proof was refereed by leading experts in analytic number theory. Zhang's result set off a flurry of activity in the field, such as the Polymath8 project. If P(N) stands for the proposition that there is an infinitude of pairs of prime numbers (not necessarily consecutive primes) that differ by exactly N, then Zhang's result is equivalent to the statement that there exists at least one even integer k < 70,000,000 such that P(k) is true. The classical form of the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to P(2); and in fact it has been conjectured that P(k) holds for all even integers k. While these stronger conjectures remain unproven, a result due to James Maynard in November 2013, employing a different technique, showed that P(k) holds for some k ‚â§ 600. Subsequently, in April 2014, the Polymath project 8 lowered the bound to k ‚â§ 246. With current methods k ‚â§ 6 is the best attainable, and in fact k ‚â§ 12 and k ‚â§ 6 follow using current methods if the Elliott‚ÄìHalberstam conjecture and its generalisation, respectively, hold.  Honors and awards  Zhang was awarded the 2013 Morningside Special Achievement Award in Mathematics, the 2013 Ostrowski Prize, the 2014 Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, and the 2014 Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics. He is a recipient of the 2014 MacArthur award, and was elected as an Academia Sinica Fellow during the same year. He was an invited speaker at the 2014 International Congress of Mathematicians.  Political views  In 1989 Zhang joined a group interested in Chinese democracy (‰∏≠ÂõΩÊ∞ëËÅî). In a 2013 interview, he affirmed that his political views on the subject hadn't changed since.

The Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology is a museum and reference collection in Schaumburg, Illinois dedicated to the history of anesthesiology. It was founded in 1933 by Dr Paul Meyer Wood, who was then Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Initially based at a series of temporary locations, it moved to its permanent home in Schaumburg in 2014. Since 1971 it has been a nonprofit educational organization operating as part of the ASA. History Founding Paul M. Wood M.D. joined the American Society of Anesthesiologists in 1925 and was made its Secretary-Treasurer in 1929. However in 1932 he became seriously ill and was unable to work, either as a practicing doctor or for the ASA. While convalescing Wood began to catalogue his personal library, which he had been building since he was a medical student, and told ASA founder Dr. Adolph Frederick ErdmannScience Service Smithsonian, The \\"Silent\\" Phonograph, retrieved 21 May 2013. that he wanted to create a museum dedicated to the history of anesthesiology. Erdmann gave him a collection of books and anesthesiology apparatus to add to his own library as the nucleus of the project. In 1933 Wood donated the entire collection to the ASA. The Society asked him to keep it at his home and appointed him librarian and curator for life.Anesthesiology, Volume 22, July/August 1961, pp 618-635, Historical Development of the Library-Museum, Albert M. Betcher M.D., retrieved 21 May 2013. They also named the new collection the Wood Library- Museum of Anesthesiology.Wood Library-Museum, Paul Wood, M.D. 1894-1963, retrieved 21 May 2013. By 1934 Wood was well enough to return to work. One of the first things he did was to approach Robert H. Ferguson, a retired anesthesiologist whom Erdmann had told him owned the largest collection of specialist books and apparatus in the USA. Ferguson was sympathetic but, still being in good health, preferred to keep his collection at home. Wood turned his attention to the minutes of the Society's meetings, which were now being recorded by a stenographer. As well as discussing ASA business these also contained much information about advances in anesthesiology, and Wood thought they would be a useful resource. He began to make copies and distribute them to the members, and began archiving them in the Library-Museum. In 1938 this system was developed into the ASA's official newsletter. Exhibitions In 1936 the ASA was approached by the organizers of the 1939 New York World's Fair and asked if they could present an exhibit on anesthesiology. The ASA agreed. The next year they received another invitation, this time to create an exhibit for the American Medical Association's annual meeting in San Francisco in June 1938. Again the invitation was accepted. The Library-Museum, which by now had expanded from its original 70 books to over 160 thanks to donations from ASA members (and had also greatly enlarged its collection of apparatus) provided the core of both exhibits. Expansion By 1937 the collection was growing too large for Wood to keep at home and he began looking for a permanent location for it. Still trying to obtain Ferguson's collection he approached a New York City company Ferguson had been associated with, E.R. Squibb and Sons, and suggested that the museum could be located in vacant space in their office building. As bait he proposed that it be called the Robert H. Ferguson Memorial Library. Ferguson didn't take the bait but Squibb did, and the Wood Library-Museum was moved to their building. More books were donated, including 30 from Ferguson, and the collection continued to grow. The larger location had space for more apparatus and members soon started making gifts of their old equipment, including some very early anesthetic delivery systems. The ASA was also now funding the collection through voluntary donations from members. In 1950 the Wood Library-Museum of Anesthesiology was officially incorporated in New York as a nonprofit educational institution. It moved to Park Ridge, Illinois in 1963, and again to its permanent home at 1061 American Lane, Schaumburg, IL 60173-4973 in 2014. In 1971 the New York incorporation was dissolved, making the Library-Museum officially part of the ASA, and in 1987 it was incorporated in Illinois as a nonprofit under ASA auspices. Collection Library The main library is both a historical record and an active specialist medical library. The collection has now expanded to around 13,000 books, and the library also contains both US and international medical journals (over 50,) newsletters, biographical material and archives of photos and digital images. A rare book room preserves older titles as well as letters and other material. Many of these are being digitized to allow them to be read without risking the original copies.Wood Library-Museum, The Library, retrieved 21 May 2013. The John W.

Sch√ºtz set the text of the biblical words in their context, framed by two stanzas from Johann B√∂schenstein's hymn \\"Da Jesus an dem Kreuze stund\\", as an oratorio or Passion cantata. He scored it for five voices (SATTB), five instrumental parts and continuo. The original title reads: Die Sieben Worte unsers lieben Erl√∂sers u. Seeligmachers Jesu Christi, so er am Stamm des Hl.

In the narrative central part, the Evangelist's words are set for one to four voices, SATB, while the second tenor is the vox Christi, the voice of Christ. According to an early manuscript, the instruments play only in the sinfonia and with the vox Christi, while the introduction, Evangelist and conclusion are accompanied only by the continuo. The instruments are not specified, and can be a choir of viols, or strings, or woodwind instruments. The two groups of performers can be placed apart in performance. The narrative and the dialogue, in which the Seven Words appear, are composed like contemporary operatic recitative in a style that Sch√ºtz had learned in Venice. The sinfonia is one of few surviving instrumental works by Sch√ºtz. The work is a precursor of his Passions. The treatment of the vox Christi with obbligato instruments was used by Bach in his St Matthew Passion. The music for the dialogues is rhetoric, following the text.  Recordings  The work was first recorded in 1966 by Archiv: Peter Schreier and Theo Adam soloed with the Dresdner Kreuzchor under Rudolf Mauersberger. It was again recorded for Naxos in 2001 along with other sacred music by Sch√ºtz, conducted by Wolfgang Helbich. A reviewer described the work as a \\"distinctive and expansive score\\", and noted: \\"The depth of feeling offered by the principals is exceptional, with significant dramatic expression combined with conviction and appropriate reverence.\\"Michael Cookson: Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Musicalisches Exequien (German Requiem) musicweb-international.com June 2004 The Dresdner Kammerchor recorded the work, along with Passions by Sch√ºtz, with soloists and a viol choir conducted by Hans-Christoph Rademann in 2012.

It was a birthday cantata composed for Joachim Friederich von Flemming, governor of Leipzig, and was first performed in Leipzig on 25 August 1726. The cantata text was written by Picander. Count Flemming is also associated with a later Bach cantata O angenehme Melodei, BWV 210a.  Possible relationship with the Easter Oratorio  The number assigned to Verjaget, zerstreuet, zerr√ºttet, ihr Sterne in the BWV catalogue indicates that some twentieth-century scholars thought the work was related to the Easter Oratorio BWV 249, which was first performed in 1725 at Easter. The case for this linkage is based on Bach's habit of recycling music for \\"one-off\\" occasions in a process called parody. The Easter Oratorio is an example of parody, being based on a lost work, Entfliehet, verschwindet, entweichet, ihr Sorgen, BWV 249a, premiered in February 1725. BWV 249a, like BWV 249b, was a birthday cantata with a text by Picander. It has been possible to reconstruct the music of BWV 249a, matching the score of the Easter Oratorio to Picander's secular text. However, in the case of Verjaget, zerstreuet, zerr√ºttet, ihr Sterne there is no known reconstruction.

Lobregat, Jr. (born March 20, 1948), is a Filipino politician having served as Zamboanga City's mayor and congressman.http://www.zamboanga.com/z/index.php?title=Celso_L._Lobregat Early life and careerhttp://www.zamboanga.com/html/celso_featured_house_member.htm Lobregat comes from a long line of landlord-politicians from Mindanao. His grandfather Pablo Lorenzo, was once Mayor of Zamboanga City and a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1934. In the Quirino administration, Don Pablo Lorenzo held several cabinet positions, which included Secretary of Education and Secretary of Public Works. During the Macapagal administration, he was chair of the Development Bank of the Philippines. Celso's mother, Maria Clara Lobregat, was a Delegate to the 1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention and was a three-term Congresswoman of Zamboanga City, starting 1987. She was elected City Mayor in 1998 and reelected in 2001. She was also among the Marcos crony-masterminds of the Coco Levy Scam, having served as the president of COCOFED, a government-sanctioned organization officially meant to represent coconut farmers. Educational life Celso finished his grade school and high school at De La Salle University, Manila. Thereafter, he enrolled at the Ateneo de Manila University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in Economics with honors. He took up his post graduate studies at the Asian Institute of Management graduating in 1972 with a Masters in Business Management. Before entering public service, agriculture and business had been Celso's field of concentration and expertise. He worked for the Elizalde group of companies for eleven years and held several key executive positions such as Marketing Manager for Elizalde International, and managing director and general manager of Tanduay Distillery. It was during Celso's watch that the firm exported its products for the first time to the US market and won several medals and awards in various international competitions of wines and spirits. Political career Congressman (1998‚Äì2004) In 1998, he ran for Congress under the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino representing the Lone District of Zamboanga City and won with her mother as Mayor. During his first term 1998 ‚Äì 2001, national projects worth over P2.2 billion were initiated and/or implemented. Cong. Lobregat has always exercised vociferous opposition to Bangsamoro self-determination, starting from his active participation in the No SPCPD Campaign in 1996 up to his present efforts to stall and derail the passage of a Bangsamoro Basic law. He continues his mother's legacy of trying to keep Coco Levy Scam money out of the hands of poor farmers and invested, instead, with the UCPB and COCOFED. This is despite the UCPB testifying in Congress that it has no desire to manage the fund. As a private citizen he spearheaded the move against the former mayor to spend P434 million of city funds to improve the Quiniput-Licomo Road, a national road which the Development Bank has already agreed to finance, together with the national government, without cost to the city. Mayor (2004‚Äì13) He was elected mayor for three terms, replacing his mother Maria Clara Lobregat. Congressman (2013‚Äì19) He was elected again for Congressman of District I, under Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino and Liberal Party. In 2019, he ran for city mayor but was lost to Maria Isabelle Climaco Salazar.

Dead Trigger 2 utilizes the Unity game engine. It was released as a free-to-play game; microtransactions are included in the final product, but the developers had tested the game without in-app purchases to make sure the core gameplay works without them.MWC 2013: Dead Trigger 2 will be F2P but provide pure gameplay and is being tested without IAP  Dead Trigger 2 news  Android  Pocket Gamer Gameplay Dead Trigger 2 is a zombie-apocalypse-themed first-person shooter with survival horror and action role-playing elements, currently available on iOS, Android and recently on Windows Phone 8.1 mobile devices. Running on the Unity game engine, the game features a progression system, numerous environments, unlockable and upgradable weapons, and various story-based and quick-play mission types. Dead Trigger 2 is a free-movement shooter; rather than the on- rails gameplay typical of mobile zombie shooters, the player controls the character's movement like a typical console or PC FPS. The game features two dramatically different control paradigms; with the default controls, the player merely aims at zombies - his or her weapons will attack automatically when a zombie is underneath the crosshair. The advanced control scheme functions like the first game - the player presses a button to fire the weapon, and an additional button lets the player aim down the weapon's sights for increased accuracy. Gameplay typically revolves around completing objectives while killing zombies (occasionally killing zombies is the only objective). The player has a limited amount of health that is refreshed at the start of each mission. The player loses health when hit by zombies or by certain environmental hazards (i.e. radiation). The player can regain health by taking healing pills or getting a health power up from a special zombie. Enemies come in two flavors, standard zombies and special zombies. Standard zombies often plod along at a slow pace and attack with their arms, but some may sprint or carry melee weapons for increased damage. Special zombies have distinct appearances and unique traits; they are deadlier and tougher to kill, but drop blueprints or large amounts of cash (and sometimes health) when killed. In addition to carrying two primary weapons, the player also carries a melee weapon and up to three types of consumable items. Consumables include health pills, grenades, exploding chickens and others.  Reception  Dead Trigger 2 received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Metacritic provides a score of 77 out of 100 based on 12 critics.

Early life He was born on 2 August 1937 in Sanawan, Muzaffargarh District, Punjab to a wealthy landlord family and he belongs to the Jat Tribe. He received his education from Aitchison College, Lahore. Politics Ghulam Mustafa Khar won his first National Assembly election in 1962 at the age of 24. He remained on posts of Minister of Water and Power, Chief Minister and Governor. In 1967 Khar joined Zulfikar Ali Bhutto as one of the founding members of the Pakistan Peoples Party as a close personal friend and political ally. He was appointed Governor and Martial Law Administrator of Punjab, the most electorally powerful province in the country by the newly sworn in President Bhutto following the collapse of Yahya Khan's military government. When the 1973 constitution was adopted in August and Bhutto became Prime Minister of Pakistan, Khar was given the portfolio of Chief Minister of Punjab Province.The Terrorist Prince: The Life and Death of Murtuza Bhutto 1997 p12 \\"Punjab, admittedly, was Bhutto's power base, but after a revolt by his most trusted deputy, Malik Ghulam Mustafa Khar, in 1974 he no longer felt too easy with the country's largest and most formidable province.\\" Thanks to complaints from within the PPP, Khar was replaced by the far more left-leaning and intellectual Hanif Ramay. Khar was briefly reappointed Governor in March 1975 before being finally dismissed in July 1975. Bhutto's suspicions over Khar's ambitions as well as the deep divisions within the PPP in the Punjab led to his refusal to allow Khar to run for Ramay's seat in Lahore. Khar's attempts to run for the seat as an independent ended in failure. By 1976 former rivals within the PPP, Khar and Ramay were working together within the Pir of Pagaro's Pakistan Muslim League (F). In April 2017, he joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and he is considered to be on the left-wing of the PTI. Personal life Khar married eight times. One of Khar's marriages was to Tehmina Durrani, a Pakistani women's rights activist and author. Her first book, My Feudal Lord, released by Vanguard Books of Lahore in June 1991 caused controversy in Pakistan's society by describing her abusive and traumatic marriage to Ghulam Mustafa Khar. His daughter Aaminah Haq is a Pakistani model and actress noted as a Lux model and for her role in the television drama Mehndi. Hina Rabbani Khar, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, is the daughter of his brother Ghulam Noor Rabbani. His son, Bilal Mustafa Khar was accused by his former wife Fakhra Younus of pouring acid over her face. Later, his son was acquitted of the charges. Four witnesses testified to seeing his son enter Fakhra's home on the day of the attack complained of receiving death threats. Later, they retracted their statements due to serious threats. In December 2003, judge dismissed the charges. Khar continued to protest his son's innocence, claiming the perpetrator was a pimp with whom his wife had been having an affair.

The leaves are oppositely arranged. The blades are up to 8 to 10 centimeters long, oval in shape with sharply toothed edges, and rough-textured or wrinkly on the upper surfaces. The inflorescence is a very narrow spike up to 40 to 45 centimeters long covered in pointed bracts. Occasional flower corollas bloom from between the bracts.

Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk (HEAR). 2007. It is well-adapted to disturbed, cultivated, and wasted land. It grows in pastures, on cropland, and on roadsides. In grazed fields it propagates rapidly because livestock find it distasteful, avoid it, and selectively graze out the other vegetation. In rainy areas it can form thick beds, but it easily persists in dry areas. In Florida, this Stachytarpheta is often confused with a closely related native species, S. jamaicensis.

Intentional plantings for ornamental purposes are a common way that this plant spreads. It is also introduced when the seed is transported in garden waste, rainwater, fodder, and contaminated seed shipments, and on vehicles. Methods of control include keeping the plants cut down or pulling them up, taking care to remove the large roots. Herbicides such as glyphosate are used. This plant has some uses in traditional medicine. Several Latin American peoples recognize extracts of the plant as a treatment to ease the symptoms of malaria.

When Gabe reveals his cancer has come back, he tells Aidan that he's decided to put the rest of his money into a new stem cell treatment, meaning his grandchildren can no longer afford to attend their school. After school administrator Rabbi Twersky refuses to provide any aid to the Blooms, Sarah suggests that Aidan homeschool his kids, and their adventure of self-discovery begins. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn't find. His brother Noah is a virtual shut-in who can only be bribed to babysit for his brother and refuses to see his dying father, from whom he is estranged. Noah falls for his neighbour Janine who is a furry costume maker, which gives him the idea to impress her by making a costume for San Diego Comic-Con. As Gabe nears death, Aidan grows closer to his wife and children, his faith through the support of young Rabbi Rosenberg, his brother and his father. Cast Production On April 24, 2013, director Zach Braff launched a Kickstarter campaign for his comedy film Wish I Was Here, aiming to make $2 million to boost the project, based on a script he co-wrote with his brother Adam J. Braff. Cinematographer Larry Sher was set as director of photography and producers Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher were set to produce the project. The campaign raised $2 million 3 days after the project was launched. On May 15, 2013, Worldview Entertainment stepped in to gap finance the project, which at that point had raised over $2.6 million. The campaign ended on May 24, 2013, and raised $3,105,473 from 46,520 people. At the film's New York premiere, actress Joey King stated that she donated money to the film on Kickstarter before she was even attached as a cast member. Casting At the time the Kickstarter was launched, Zach Braff and Jim Parsons had already been cast. Braff plays Aidan Bloom, a struggling actor, husband and father trying to find his purpose. On May 14, 2013, Mandy Patinkin joined the cast, playing Gabe Bloom, Aidan's father. Josh Gad also joined the cast to play the role of Aidan's brother. On May 15, Anna Kendrick signed on to play Janine, a young woman who is into Cosplay. Kate Hudson joined on May 20 to play Sarah Bloom, Aidan's wife. Joey King was set to play Grace Bloom, the 12-year-old daughter of Aidan and Sarah Bloom, on July 2, 2013. Pierce Gagnon was added to the cast on July 9, to play Tucker Bloom, son of Aidan and Sarah. On July 17, it was announced that Ashley Greene would replace Anna Kendrick as Janine. Filming Principal photography took 25 days, beginning on August 5, 2013 in Los Angeles and ending on September 6, 2013. Release The film's first trailer was released on April 9, 2014. The film had its world premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival in January 2014, 10 years after the premiere of Braff's directorial debut Garden State. Focus Features bought the distribution rights for $2.75 million. After its opening at Sundance, it was announced that the film would open on July 18, 2014, exclusively in New York and Los Angeles. The release ended up a bit wider, playing in 68 theaters during its opening weekend. The release then expanded on July 25. The special preview screening in London was attended by Kate Hudson and Zach Braff on September 18, 2014. Critical reception Wish I Was Here received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval of 46%, based on 127 reviews, with the site's consensus reading: \\"There's no denying Wish I Was Here is heartfelt, but it covers narrative ground that's already been well trod ‚Äì particularly by director Zach Braff's previous features.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

He helped his Japanese gymnastics team claim a gold medal in the all-around competition at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Career Nakano started a sporting career under the influence of his sister and his parents, both of whom were former gymnasts. He attended Nippon Sport Science University in Setagaya, Tokyo, and grew as an independent gymnast. He had a natural talent for the sport, and the physical ability to try a \\"triple back\\" dismount on the parallel bars. Even though he had a good potential, Nakano could not produce a satisfied result because he committed numerous mistakes in the sport. In 1999, Nakano broke a thighbone at the Japanese national championships, almost prompting his decision to desist the sport. Nakano was named to the Japanese gymnastics team for the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, but he injured a left anterior cruciate ligament at the national championships which made him impossible to compete. In 2003, Nakano made his official debut at the Summer Universiade in Daegu, where he placed third as a member of the Japanese team in the team all-around competition. Nakano qualified as part of the Japanese gymnastics team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens by receiving an official place from the NHK Cup in Tokyo. On the first day of the Games, he occupied one of the top two spots in the horizontal bar (9.775) and in the parallel bars (9.800), after producing stellar performances for each in the prelim stage. In the team all- around, Nakano ended a 28-year-old drought to capture the gold medal for Japan, joining on top of the podium by Isao Yoneda, Hiroyuki Tomita, Naoya Tsukahara, Hisashi Mizutori, and Takehiro Kashima. During the competition, Nakano performed only a floor exercise in a score of 9.412 to sum up the team's total of 173.821. During the individual stages, Nakano failed to medal in any of his apparatus exercises, finishing fifth in the parallel bars (9.762), sixth in the floor (9.712), and ninth in the horizontal bar (8.750).

Members *Ames *Cedar Falls *Fort Dodge *Marshalltown *Mason City *Newton *Waterloo East *Waterloo West History The Big Eight Conference was formed in 1963 when Des Moines North and Des Moines East left the old Big Six Conference to compete in the Metropolitan Conference. The league's four remaining members (Fort Dodge, Mason City, and the Waterloo schools) reached out to other large schools in central Iowa to rebuild the conference. Cedar Falls joined from the Northeast Iowa Conference and Ames, Marshalltown, and Newton joined from the Central Iowa Conference. The conference became known as the Big Nine Conference when Waterloo Central opened in 1972. The name would be changed back to the Big Eight Conference in 1988 when Waterloo Central, as part of a school district reorganization, was converted to a junior high school. From the onset, the league was one of the strongest in the state. In its first year of competition, league schools captured state championships in four of the seven sports the IHSAA conducted championships for at the time. The league also claimed the first two 5-on-5 girls' basketball titles in state history (for many years the IGHSAU only sponsored 6-on-6 basketball). Among other notable achievements, the league also had a stronghold on the boys' cross country title for 12 years, winning a state title all but one year from 1964 to 1975. The league was stable until the late 1980s when Newton and Ames left to join the Central Iowa Metro League. Soon after, the other members of the conference began looking for new homes. Marshalltown found a home in the CIML. Cedar Falls, Waterloo East, and Waterloo West then joined the Mississippi Valley Conference and Fort Dodge and Mason City, geographic outliers to among the rest of the state's largest schools, followed Marshalltown, Ames, and Newton to the CIML after being originally being declined membership in the league.

During the first performance, Lucien Guitry played the role of Jean Roule.  A militant anarchist  Lucien Guitry As suggested by the name he adopts symbolically, Jean Roule is a rouleur, that is a proleterian with no attachments, who slogs away whenever he finds work, but does not put down roots. He is also a militant libertarian, who, wherever he goes, tries to raise the consciousness of his brothers in misery, the workers, often too exhausted from their work and too fatalistic to actively involve themselves in the struggle to change their status as slaves, for example, the elder Thieux who, at the beginning of the play, has lost his wife, worn out and destroyed by her work. This is what Jean Roule does upon his arrival at the Hargand factory, from which infernal smoke ascends, and more specifically, by converting to his ideal the young Madeleine, Thieux‚Äôs daughter, who reacts with sensitivity to his sincerity, his solidarity with the miners, and his charisma. He ends up persuading his co-workers to stage a strike, in hopes of achieving through their struggle, not only tangible improvements to salaries, working conditions, and workplace safety, but also the right to culture and beauty.¬´ Si pauvre qu'il soit, un homme ne vit pas que de pain... Il a droit, comme les riches, √† de la beaut√© !... ¬ª (Les Mauvais bergers, III,5). Unfortunately, the boss Hargand proves inflexible, hunger grips the strikers, and Jean Roule makes the mistake of refusing help offered by socialist deputies, who are no more in his eyes than mauvais bergers (bad sheperds) desiring only to \\"maintain and increase their electoral power\\".¬´ Je n'ai pas voulu que, sous pr√©texte de vous d√©fendre, des intrigants viennent nous imposer des combinaisons o√π vous n'√™tes ‚Äî entendez- vous ‚Äî qu'un moyen pour maintenir et accro√Ætre leur puissance √©lectorale... et qu'une proie pour satisfaire leurs app√©tits politiques !...

Leurs int√©r√™ts ne se confondent pas plus dans les v√¥tres... que ceux de l'usurier et de son d√©biteur... de l'assassin et de sa victime!... ¬ª (Les Mauvais bergers, IV, 2). Jean Roule then risks being lynched by members of the angry crowd, who blame him for the failure of their struggle, but he is saved by the intervention of Madeleine. When armed soldiers, called on by Hargand, fire on the unarmed crowd, however, Jean Roule is killed, and Madeleine, pregnant and wounded, dies, collapsing on his cadavre; Jean Roule‚Äôs child, who could have embodied hope for a future emancipation of the workers, dies with its mother. Octave Mirbeau, who was also an anarchist,¬´ Anarchie ¬ª, in Dictionnaire Octave Mirbeau. shared the claims put forward by Jean Roule and he admired his energy, his determination and his sacrifice. But he nevertheless considered him to be yet another mauvais berger because, through his instransigeance and refusal of all compromise, he leads the workers to their deaths.Octave Mirbeau, ¬´ Un mot personnel ¬ª, Le Journal, 12/19/1897.

Timeline  On 7 April 2000, Delhi police Crime Branch officer Ishwar Singh Redhu revealed they had a recording of a conversation between Cronje and Sanjay Chawla, a representative of an Indian betting syndicate, over match-fixing allegations. Three other players, Herschelle Gibbs, Nicky Boje, and Pieter Strydom, were also implicated. On 8 April 2000, the United Cricket Board of South Africa denied their players were involved in match-fixing. Cronje said \\"the allegations are completely without substance\\". However, on 11 April Cronje was sacked as captain after confessing to Ali Bacher that he had not been \\"entirely honest\\". He admitted accepting between $10,000 to $15,000 from a London-based bookmaker for 'forecasting' results, not match fixing, during the recent one day series in India. On 7 June, the King Commission began. The following day, Gibbs revealed that Cronje had offered him $15,000 to score less than 20 runs in the 5th ODI at Nagpur. He also admitted another offer of $15,000 to Henry Williams to concede more than 50 runs in that same match. Gibbs scored 74 off 53 balls and Williams injured his shoulder and couldn't complete his second over, so neither received the $15,000. Off-spinner Derek Crookes, who was also a witness, admitted being surprised to open the bowling at Nagpur. On 15 June, Cronje released a statement that revealed all his contact with bookmakers. In 1996 during the third Test in Kanpur, he was introduced to Mukesh Gupta by Mohammad Azharuddin. Gupta gave Cronje $30,000 to persuade the South Africans to lose wickets on the last day to lose the match. South Africa were 127/5 chasing 460, Cronje was already out and spoke to no other players. \\"I had received money for doing nothing.\\" During the return tour, Cronje received $50,000 from Gupta for team information. In the 2000 Centurion Test, Marlon Aronstam contacted him offering R500,000 (approximately ¬£50,000 at the time) for the charity of his choice together with a gift if Cronje declared and made a game of it. He also admitted asking Pieter Strydom to place a R50 bet on South Africa to win for him. After the match Aronstam visited Cronje, giving him two amounts of money (R30,000 and R20,000) together with a leather jacket. The promised R500,000 did not materialise. Before the one-day series, Cronje received repeated calls from \\"Sanjay\\" asking him to fix a match. Cronje gave him the names of Gibbs, Strydom and Boje to try to get rid of him. Cronje was offered $140,000 for the fifth ODI if Gibbs scored under 20, Williams went for more than 50 and South Africa scored around 270. On 28 August, Gibbs and Williams were suspended from international cricket for six months. Gibbs was fined R60,000 and Williams R10,000. Strydom received no punishment. On 11 October, Cronje was banned from playing or coaching cricket for life. He challenged his life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001, his application was dismissed. Cronje was killed in a private plane accident in 2002.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1396132/Banned- South-African-cricket-captain-is-killed-in-plane-crash.html Subsequent reporting on Cronje's involvement in match-fixing revealed that Cronje had more than 70 bank accounts in the Cayman Islands which were, because they were not declared to the South African Revenue Service, illegal. The South African investigation was terminated at his death: but the implication of the multiple accounts was that the match-fixing was much more widespread than had been revealed to the King Commission. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/2398030/Revealed-the-great-Cronje- cover-up.html After 13 years on July 22, 2013 the Delhi Police registered an FIR for match-fixing in 2000, the chargesheet in the case involving a few South African cricketers including its former captain Hansie Cronje, was finally filed.

It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historic Places in El Paso County, Colorado. American Dreams. Retrieved May 21, 2013. Judson Moss Bemis family Judson Moss Bemis and his wife, Alice Cogswell Bemis, moved to Colorado Springs in 1881 for her health. She may have had tuberculosis. (See Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs). The house was built in 1885 and became the permanent home of Alice Bemis and their daughter, Alice; Judson Moss Bemis lived in the home several months a year and conducted business and lived the rest of the year in Boston. He was the founder of J. M. Bemis Company. In Colorado Springs, Bemis founded the Business Administration and Banking School, was a trustee of Colorado College and donated monies for the Jackson and Bemis Halls. Alice Cogswell Bemis founded the Day Care Center in 1897. The couple's daughter, Alice Bemis Taylor, donated monies to Colorado College, helped fund the construction of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and the Colorado Springs Day Nursery, and provided scholarships. She was the first woman trustee of Colorado College, founded the Bemis-Taylor Child Guidance Clinic, and in 2010 was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame. The house The Bemis House, designed by W. F. Ellis, is a blend of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Colonial Revival and Stick architectural styles. The three story home originally had 10 rooms and a partial basement, and received additions in 1886 and 1887. In 1935, the home was converted into an apartment house with 10 apartments based upon designs by architects MacLaren and Thomas. Hearthstone Inn Dot Williams and Ruth Williams purchased the Bemis House and the neighboring historic home to create Hearthstone Inn. The second house was built in 1900. For a period of time it was a boarding house for individuals with tuberculosis. The buildings were restored and renovated as an inn with a restaurant and 25 rooms. The architects for the project were Al Feinstein of Colorado Springs and William Odum of Dallas. The inn and its antiques were purchased by David and Nancy Oxenhandler in 1999 for $1,925,000. In 2005 it was sold to Griffis/ Blessing Investment Services.

From the age of eighteen he took private organ and harmony lessons with Alexandre Guilmant. At the Conservatoire de Paris he studied counterpoint, fugue and composition with Th√©odore Dubois. For his compositions he was twice awarded the gold medal at the Grand Prix Pleyel. In the following years he performed as a concert organist throughout France.

The program purpose was to collect intelligence cycle on potential contingency plans of Carter administration sabotaging of certain bomb-related installations and facilities. The program was initiated in 1979 by Imtiaz Ahmed, then chief of Intelligence Bureau. The Sun Rising was downscaled with the arrest and conviction of an agent working for CIA and the declaration of a few undercover CIA agents and US diplomats as personae non gratae and their return. The program remained highly secretive for several years after its operational activities activated since 1979. The program's existence was discovered by espionage investigative journalist, Ansar Abbasi of the News International in 2009.

It was discovered in 2007 with the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank's Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in a drift-scan survey. In 2013, a mass measurement for this neutron star was announced: . This measurement was done with a combination of radio timing and precise spectroscopy of the white dwarf companion. This is slightly higher than, but statistically indistinguishable from, the mass of PSR J1614‚àí2230, which was measured using the Shapiro delay. This measurement confirmed the existence of such massive neutron stars using a different measuring technique. The notable feature of this binary pulsar is its combination of high neutron star mass and short orbital period: 2 hours and 27 minutes. This allowed a measurement of the orbital decay due to the emission of gravitational waves, as observed for PSR B1913+16 and PSR J0737‚àí3039. Background The first radio pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell and her adviser, Antony Hewish using the Interplanetary Scintillation Array. Franco Pacini and Thomas Gold quickly put forth the idea that pulsars are highly magnetized rotating neutron stars, which form as a result of a supernova at the end of the life of stars more massive than about 10 times the mass of the Sun (). The radiation emitted by pulsars is caused by interaction of the plasma surrounding the neutron star with its rapidly rotating magnetic field. This interaction leads to emission \\"in the pattern of a rotating beacon,\\" as emission escapes along the magnetic poles of the neutron star. The \\"rotating beacon\\" property of pulsars arises from the misalignment of their magnetic poles with their rotational poles. Historically, pulsars have been discovered at radio wavelengths where emission is strong, but space telescopes that operate in the gamma ray wavelengths have also discovered pulsars. Observations In 2007, the Green Bank Telescope underwent track repair, and was unable to track for several months. An international team of astronomers was nevertheless able to record the data from the antenna, letting the Earth do the job of moving the beam of the telescope across the sky, a process known as a drift scan survey. They found a total of 35 new pulsars, including 7 new millisecond pulsars and PSR J0348+0432. In 2011 the white dwarf companion to the pulsar was observed with the FORS2 spectrograph of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope, in Chile. These data were combined with radio observations to determine the mass of the white dwarf and the pulsar. Radio timing of the pulsar with the 305-m radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory and the Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope soon also detected the orbital decay of the system due to the emission of gravitational waves. This matched the rate predicted by general relativity. Significance The combination of a large neutron star mass, low white dwarf mass (mass ratio ~ 1:11.7) and short orbital period (2 hours and 27 minutes) allows astronomers to test general relativity in a regime of extreme gravitational fields, where it has never been tested before. The result also has implications for the direct detection of gravitational waves and for understanding of stellar evolution. The measured mass of 2.01 \\\\pm 0.04 M_\\\\odot puts an empirical lower bound on the value of the Tolman‚ÄìOppenheimer‚ÄìVolkoff limit. PSR J0348+0432 is also a candidate for a hyperon star, a massive neutron star containing hyperons.

Cinechile.cl. Encyclopedia of Chilean film (in Spanish). Retrieved 21 May 2013.The Summer of Flying Fish. Alpha Violet. Retrieved 21 May 2013. Brief Review The Chilean female director, Marcela Said, very delicately handles the theme of the storyline based on the long-standing conflict between the native Mapuche and the white land owners of European descent, and very skillfully depicts the drama and emotion in the film in a lifelike reality, which is further complemented by her choice of actors who have no experience in film acting. The overall effect of the film is a blend of both fiction and non-fiction. Apart from making an effort to give the story a graphic touch, the director appears to have tried bringing to light the gross injustice meted out by the rich white settlers to the native South American Mapuche tribesmen. The film based on a socio-political theme may draw a distinctive section of the cinema crowd but not much on the commercial market. The debut directorial venture of ex-documentary director, however, has had some critical reviews too on the media coverage following the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. Although very successful in building up on-the- edge-of-your-seat sequences, the movie suffers from poor narrative, shallow characterization and vague motivation.

He was the eldest son of Shrimant Sardar Tukoji Rao Holkar, from his first wife. Life The death of Tukoji Rao proved disastrous to the interests of the Holkars, as it marked the commencement of a period of prolonged strife between his four sons Kashi Rao Holkar, Malhar Rao Holkar, Yashwant Rao Holkar and Vithoji Rao Holkar. But for securing the gaddi of the Holkars, Tukoji left two sons, Kashi Rao and Malhar Rao. Tukoji Rao during his lifetime, residing in pune, declared Kashi Rao as his successor but he was handicapped and adulterous and due to this reason, the public and the soldiers also did not like Kashi Rao and preferred Malhar Rao as a ruler. Since Malhar Rao had all the qualities of a good administrator and as a good military leader, Malhar Rao, Vitthoji Rao, and Yashwant Rao opposed Kashi Rao and demanded that Malhar Rao should be the leader of the Holkar dynasty succeeding Shreemant Tukoji Rao. Kashi Rao was also a man of weak intellect. His brother Malhar Rao was cast in a different mould. He was a man of great activity and energy and was of a turbulent disposition. He had, in 1791-92, given great trouble by raiding and devastating lands belonging both to the Holkars and other neighboring chiefs. He was finally brought under control by a force under Rao Rao Appaji and Dudrenec. His father was very furious and in one letter complained to Ahilya Bai of his bad bringing up. Malcolm states that Ahilya Bai and Tukoji desired Kashi Rao and Malhar Rao to occupy positions similar to those occupied by themselves - Kashi Rao to be the administrative head of Maheshwar, and Malhar Rao to become the commander-in-chief of the troops. The correspondence in the State records, however, in no way bears out this contemplated arrangement; on the contrary, it shows concussively that after the death of Ahilya Bai, Tukoji was bent on securing the succession of Kashi Rao. There are numerous letters written by Tukoji to Kashi Rao, when his health began to decline, urging him to come to him so that his succession to the gaddi of the Holkars may be secured, upbringing him for his delay and asserting that he had obtained Scindia's support for him. In 1796, he appeared before his father and was formally invested with a khilat as his heir. Kashi Rao wrote to Ram Rao Appaji on Tuesday 8 November 1796. \\"My father has been very ill, and I came here by forced marches to visit him. He presented me with a dress of honour, recognizing me as his successor. This has enraged Malhar Rao so much that he has left our camp, and is halting close to the Peshwa. I do not know what his intentions are. Please take steps to watch his actions.\\" From the moment of their father's death Kashi Rao and Malhar Rao, the two brothers, commenced contending for the gaddi. Malhar Rao threw himself on the protection of the Peshwa, while Kashi Rao secured the support of Scindia through the instrumentality of the latter's Minister Sarje Rao Ghatke. A reconciliation was, however, effected between the two brothers on the pretext of avoiding a civil war, which was sworn to by the most solemn oaths. When Kashi Rao felt that his authority was in danger, he sought the help of Daulat Rao Scindia of Gwalior who was considered jealous of the Holkars, due to the growing prominence and rising power of Holkars in North India. On 14 September 1797, Daulat Rao Scindia suddenly attacked Malhar Rao and killed him. His infant son fell into Scindia's hands, who at once put him into safe custody. Yashwant Rao and his brother Vithoji, however, escaped, the former to Nagpur and the latter to Kolhapur. Yashwantrao Holkar took shelter at Nagpur's Raghoji II Bhonsle. When Scindia learned this, he asked Raghoji II Bhonsle to arrest Yashwantrao Holkar. Yashwantrao was arrested on 20 February 1798. Bhawani Shankar Khatri, who was with Yashwantrao, helped him to escape, and both of them escaped from Nagpur on 6 April 1798. The public support for Yashwant Rao Holkar was growing. Many courageous soldiers also joined the army of Yashwantrao Holkar. Anandrao Pawar the King of Dhar also helped Yashwant Rao since he was also proved helpful to Anandrao in curbing the rebellion of one of his ministers, Rangnath. Yashwant Rao Holkar defeated the army of Shevelier Duddres near Kasrawad and captured Maheshwar. In January 1799 Yashwant Rao was crowned King of the Holkar Dynasty as per Hindu Vedic rites and succeeded Kashirao from February 1799 as sixth ruler of the Holkar Kingdom.

Biography   Early life and education  Born in Durham, England, Lancelot Booth was the son of Lancelot Parker Booth, colliery owner, and his wife, Anne Hedley. He emigrated to New Zealand in the 1870s and moved to Australia in 1876.  Career  In the early 1870s Booth worked on the stage in New Zealand, marrying actress Eliza Frances Eltham at the Union Hotel in Dunedin on 29 January 1873. During Booth's period in New Zealand his works for stage included: Guided by Public Opinion, or the Fortunes of a New-Chum (farce), Crime in the Clouds (drama), Formosa Married (farce), and New Magdalene.http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A)iv?idtype=oldid He moved to Australia in 1876, where he initially worked on the Sydney stage. He made his first appearance at the Royal Victoria Theatre on 24 July 1876 as Count De Rivera in the Italian drama, Society, or a Mistake in Education. Booth was a prolific performer, appearing in more than 70 productions between 1876 and 1880, many of them alongside fellow actor Bland Holt, mainly in the Victoria Theatre and Queen's Theatre. The two first appeared together in The Steeplechase at the Royal Victoria on 28 October 1876 in Holt's first appearance in Sydney. During the early to mid-1880s, he lived in Brisbane, where he was connected with the Brisbane Theatre Royal, appearing in more than 20 productions. Booth returned to Sydney sometime after 1885 and from that time made only rare appearances on stage. He appeared as Charles Beeswing in the farce, Taming a Tiger, at the Royal Standard on 28 November 1892 and in July 1898 joined with several old actors to perform Othello to raise money for the benefit of retired actors. Booth also wrote a number of plays including Crime in the Clouds, performed at the Royal Standard Theatre in Sydney in January 1898 by Henry's Sydney and Suburban Company and Outlaw Kelly (1899) a four Act melodrama, first performed in Tasmania in September 1899 by the Henry Dramatic Company. In addition to writing plays, he published short stories, poetry and children's fiction as well as two popular novels: The Devil's Nightcap (1912), an Australian bushranging adventure of the Frank Gardiner‚ÄìBen Hall gang, and Tools of Satan (1914), a murder mystery in an English setting, both published by the NSW Bookstall Company. Many of his short stories and poems were published in The Queenslander. Favourite subjects were bushranging and life on the gold diggings, with many themes exploring encounters between migrants from the 'old country' and the Australian bush. In May 1903 at the age of 58, Booth commenced on a walking tour of the north coast of New South Wales, starting at the Hunter River and ending at the Tweed River on the Queensland border and then back again. His plan was to publish an account of his travels and although he duly completed this endeavour, the account appears to have never found its way into print.Northern Star 19 August 1903  Death and afterward  Booth died on 20 May 1913 in Balmain aged 67 and is buried in Rookwood Cemetery in Sydney. His wife, Eliza, pre-deceased him 20 years earlier on 4 September 1893. Together, they had ten children: Mark, George, Harry, Francis, Ada, Ernest, Ruby, William, Archibald, Harold and Mary.

Macroscopically, the superposition state of the material results in an optical polarization, i.e., a rapidly oscillating dipole density. The optical polarization is a genuine non-equilibrium quantity that decays to zero when the excited system relaxes to its equilibrium state after the electromagnetic pulse is switched off. Due to this decay which is called dephasing, coherent effects are observable only for a certain temporal duration after pulsed photoexcitation. Various materials such as atoms, molecules, metals, insulators, semiconductors are studied using coherent optical spectroscopy and such experiments and their theoretical analysis has revealed a wealth of insights on the involved matter states and their dynamical evolution.

Physical Review B 37 (2): 941‚Äì955. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.37.941 which are able to theoretically describe coherent semiconductor optics on the basis of a fully microscopic many-body quantum theory are introduced. Then, a few prominent examples for coherent effects in semiconductor optics are described all of which can be understood theoretically on the basis of the SBEs. Starting point Macroscopically, Maxwell's equations show that in the absence of free charges and currents an electromagnetic field interacts with matter via the optical polarization {\\\\mathbf P}. The wave equation for the electric field {\\\\mathbf E} reads ( abla \\\\cdot abla - \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}) {\\\\mathbf E}({\\\\mathbf r},t) = \\\\mu_0 \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2} {\\\\mathbf P}({\\\\mathbf r},t) and shows that the second derivative with respect to time of {\\\\mathbf P}, i.e., \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}{\\\\mathbf P}, appears as a source term in the wave equation for the electric field {\\\\mathbf E}. Thus, for optically thin samples and measurements performed in the far-field, i.e., at distances significantly exceeding the optical wavelength \\\\lambda, the emitted electric field resulting from the polarization is proportional to its second time derivative, i.e., {\\\\mathbf E} \\\\propto \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}{\\\\mathbf P}. Therefore, measuring the dynamics of the emitted field {\\\\mathbf E}(t) provides direct information on the temporal evolution of the optical material polarization {\\\\mathbf P}(t). Microscopically, the optical polarization arises from quantum mechanical transitions between different states of the material system. For the case of semiconductors, electromagnetic radiation with optical frequencies is able to move electrons from the valence (v) to the conduction (c) band. The macroscopic polarization {\\\\mathbf P} is computed by summing over all microscopic transition dipoles p_{cv} via {\\\\mathbf P} = \\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\sum_{c,v} ({\\\\mathbf d}_{cv} p_{cv} + \\\\mathrm{c.c.} ), where {\\\\mathbf d}_{cv} is the dipole matrix element which determines the strength of individual transitions between the states v and c, \\\\mathrm{c.c.} denotes the complex conjugate, and V is the appropriately chosen system's volume. If \\\\epsilon_c and \\\\epsilon_v are the energies of the conduction and valence band states, their dynamic quantum mechanical evolution is according to the Schr√∂dinger equation given by phase factors \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\epsilon_c \\\\, t/\\\\hbar} and \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\epsilon_v \\\\, t/\\\\hbar}, respectively. The superposition state described by p_{cv} is evolving in time according to \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} (\\\\epsilon_c - \\\\epsilon_v) t/\\\\hbar}. Assuming that we start at t=0 with p_{cv}(t=0) = p_{cv,0}, we have for the optical polarization {\\\\mathbf P} (t) = \\\\sum_{c,v} ( {\\\\mathbf d}_{cv} p_{cv,0} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} (\\\\epsilon_c - \\\\epsilon_v) t/\\\\hbar} + \\\\mathrm{c.c.} ). Thus, {\\\\mathbf P} (t) is given by a summation over the microscopic transition dipoles which all oscillate with frequencies corresponding to the energy differences between the involved quantum states. Clearly, the optical polarization {\\\\mathbf P} (t) is a coherent quantity which is characterized by an amplitude and a phase. Depending on the phase relationships of the microscopic transition dipoles, one may obtain constructive or destructive interference, in which the microscopic dipoles are in or out of phase, respectively, and temporal interference phenomena like quantum beats, in which the modulus of {\\\\mathbf P} (t) varies as function of time. Ignoring many-body effects and the coupling to other quasi particles and to reservoirs, the dynamics of photoexcited two-level systems can be described by a set of two equations, the so-called optical Bloch equations. Allen, L.; Eberly, J. H. (1987). Optical Resonance and Two-Level Atoms. Dover Publications. . These equations are named after Felix Bloch who formulated them in order to analyze the dynamics of spin systems in nuclear magnetic resonance. The two-level Bloch equations read \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} p_{cv} = \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon \\\\, p_{cv} + {\\\\mathbf E} \\\\cdot {\\\\mathbf d} I and \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} I = 2 {\\\\mathbf E} \\\\cdot {\\\\mathbf d} ( p_{cv} - p_{cv}^\\\\star ). Here, \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon=(\\\\epsilon_c - \\\\epsilon_v) denotes the energy difference between the two states and I is the inversion, i.e., the difference in the occupations of the upper and the lower states. The electric field {\\\\mathbf E} couples the microscopic polarization p to the product of the Rabi energy {\\\\mathbf E} \\\\cdot {\\\\mathbf d} and the inversion I. In the absence of the driving electric field, i.e., for {\\\\mathbf E} = \\\\mathbf{0}, the Bloch equation for p describes an oscillation, i.e., p_{cv} (t) \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\Delta \\\\epsilon \\\\, t/\\\\hbar}. The optical Bloch equations enable a transparent analysis of several nonlinear optical experiments. They are, however, only well suited for systems with optical transitions between isolated levels in which many-body interactions are of minor importance as is sometimes the case in atoms or small molecules. In solid state systems, such as semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures, an adequate description of the many-body Coulomb interaction and the coupling to additional degrees of freedom is essential and thus the optical Bloch equations are not applicable. The semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) For a realistic description of optical processes in solid materials, it is essential to go beyond the simple picture of the optical Bloch equations and to treat many-body interactions that describe the coupling among the elementary material excitations by, e.g., the see article Coulomb interaction between the electrons and the coupling to other degrees of freedom, such as lattice vibrations, i.e., the electron-phonon coupling. Within a semiclassical approach, where the light field is treated as a classical electromagnetic field and the material excitations are described quantum mechanically, all above mentioned effects can be treated microscopically on the basis of a many- body quantum theory. For semiconductors the resulting system of equations are known as the semiconductor Bloch equations. For the simplest case of a two- band model of a semiconductor, the SBEs can be written schematically as \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} p_{\\\\mathbf k} = \\\\Delta \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\mathbf k} \\\\, p_{\\\\mathbf k} + \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k} \\\\, (n^c_{\\\\mathbf k} - n^v_{\\\\mathbf k}) \\\\+ \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} p_{\\\\mathbf k}_{\\\\text{corr}} \\\\, , \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} n^c_{\\\\mathbf k} = ( \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k}^\\\\star \\\\, p_{\\\\mathbf k} - \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k} \\\\, p_{\\\\mathbf k}^\\\\star ) \\\\+ \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} n^c_{\\\\mathbf k}_{\\\\text{corr}} \\\\, , \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} n^v_{\\\\mathbf k} = \\\\- ( \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k}^\\\\star \\\\, p_{\\\\mathbf k} - \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k} \\\\, p_{\\\\mathbf k}^\\\\star ) \\\\+ \\\\mathrm{i} \\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} n^v_{\\\\mathbf k}_{\\\\text{corr}} \\\\, . Here p_{\\\\mathbf k} is the microscopic polarization and n^c_{\\\\mathbf k} and n^v_{\\\\mathbf k} are the electron occupations in the conduction and valence bands (c and v), respectively, and \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf k} denotes the crystal momentum. As a result of the many-body Coulomb interaction and possibly further interaction processes, the transition energy \\\\Delta \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\mathbf k} and the Rabi energy \\\\Omega_{\\\\mathbf k} both depend on the state of the excited system, i.e., they are functions of the time- dependent polarizations p_{\\\\mathbf k'} and occupations n^c_{\\\\mathbf k'} and n^v_{\\\\mathbf k'}, respectively, at all crystal momenta \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf k'}. Due to this coupling among the excitations for all values of the crystal momentum \\\\hbar {\\\\mathbf k}, the optical excitations in semiconductor cannot be described on the level of isolated optical transitions but have to be treated as an interacting many-body quantum system. A prominent and important result of the Coulomb interaction among the photoexcitations is the appearance of strongly absorbing discrete excitonic resonances which show up in the absorption spectra of semiconductors spectrally below the fundamental band gap frequency. Since an exciton consists of a negatively charged conduction band electron and a positively charged valence band hole (i.e., an electron missing in the valence band) which attract each other via the Coulomb interaction, excitons have a hydrogenic series of discrete absorption lines. Due to the optical selection rules of typical III-V semiconductors such as Galliumarsenide (GaAs) only the s-states, i.e., 1s, 2s, etc., can be optically excited and detected, see article on Wannier equation. The many-body Coulomb interaction leads to significant complications since it results in an infinite hierarchy of dynamic equations for the microscopic correlation functions that describe the nonlinear optical response. The terms given explicitly in the SBEs above arise from a treatment of the Coulomb interaction in the time- dependent Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation. Whereas this level is sufficient to describe excitonic resonances, there are several further effects, e.g., excitation-induced dephasing, contributions from higher-order correlations like excitonic populations and biexcitonic resonances, which require one to treat so-called many-body correlation effects that are by definition beyond the Hartree‚ÄìFock level. These contributions are formally included in the SBEs given above in the terms denoted by _\\\\text{corr}. The systematic truncation of the many-body hierarchy and the development and the analysis of controlled approximations schemes is an important topic in the microscopic theory of the optical processes in condensed matter systems. Depending on the particular system and the excitation conditions several approximations schemes have been developed and applied. For highly excited systems, it is often sufficient to describe many-body Coulomb correlations using the second order Born approximation.Jahnke, F.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Tai, K. (1996). \\"Excitonic Nonlinearities of Semiconductor Microcavities in the Nonperturbative Regime\\".

W. (2011). Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. . in which the nonlinear optical response is classified by correlation functions which explicitly take into account interactions between a certain maximum number of particles and factorize larger correlation functions into products of lower order ones. Selected coherent effects By nonlinear optical spectroscopy using ultrafast laser pulses with durations on the order of ten to hundreds of femtoseconds, several coherent effects have been observed and interpreted. Such studies and their proper theoretical analysis have revealed a wealth of information on the nature of the photoexcited quantum states, the coupling among them, and their dynamical evolution on ultrashort time scales. In the following, a few important effects are briefly described. Quantum beats involving excitons and exciton complexes Quantum beats are observable in systems in which the total optical polarization is due to a finite number of discrete transition frequencies which are quantum mechanically coupled, e.g., by common ground or excited states. Koch, M.; Feldmann, J.; von Plessen, G.; G√∂bel, E.; Thomas, P.; K√∂hler, K. (1992). \\"Quantum beats versus polarization interference: An experimental distinction\\".

Chemical Physics 210 (1-2): 367‚Äì388. doi:10.1016/0301-0104(96)00135-8 Assuming for simplicity that all these transitions have the same dipole matrix element, after excitation with a short laser pulse at t=0 the optical polarization {\\\\mathbf P} (t) of the system evolves as \\\\sum_l \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\mathrm{i} \\\\Delta \\\\omega_{l} t}, where the index l labels the participating transitions. A finite number of frequencies results in temporal modulations of the squared modulus of the polarization {\\\\mathbf P} (t)^2 and thus of the intensity of the emitted electromagnetic field {\\\\mathbf E} (t)^2 with time periods 2 \\\\pi/(\\\\Delta \\\\omega_{l} - \\\\Delta \\\\omega_{j}). For the case of just two frequencies the squared modulus of the polarization is proportional to [1+\\\\cos((\\\\Delta \\\\omega_1 - \\\\Delta \\\\omega_2)t)], i.e., due to the interference of two contributions with the same amplitude but different frequencies, the polarization varies between a maximum and zero. In semiconductors and semiconductor heterostructures, such as quantum wells, nonlinear optical quantum-beat spectroscopy has been widely used to investigate the temporal dynamics of excitonic resonances. In particular, the consequences of many-body effects which depending on the excitation conditions may lead to, e.g., a coupling among different excitonic resonances via biexcitons and other Coulomb correlation contributions and to a decay of the coherent dynamics by scattering and dephasing processes, has been explored in many pump-probe and four-wave-mixing measurements. The theoretical analysis of such experiments in semiconductors requires a treatment on the basis of quantum mechanical many-body theory as is provided by the SBEs with many-body correlations incorporated on an adequate level. Photon echoes of excitons In nonlinear optics it is possible to reverse the destructive interference of so-called inhomogeneously broadened systems which contain a distribution of uncoupled subsystems with different resonance frequencies. For example, consider a four-wave-mixing experiment in which the first short laser pulse excites all transitions at t=0. As a result of the destructive interference between the different frequencies the overall polarization decays to zero. A second pulse arriving at t=\\\\tau>0 is able to conjugate the phases of the individual microscopic polarizations, i.e., p \\\\rightarrow p^\\\\star, of the inhomogeneously broadened system. The subsequent unperturbed dynamical evolution of the polarizations leads to rephasing such that all polarization are in phase at t=2\\\\tau which results in a measurable macroscopic signal. Thus, this so-called photon echo occurs since all individual polarizations are in phase and add up constructively at t=2\\\\tau. Since the rephasing is only possible if the polarizations remain coherent, the loss of coherence can be determined by measuring the decay of the photon echo amplitude with increasing time delay. When photon echo experiments are performed in semiconductors with exciton resonances,Noll, G.; Siegner, U.; Shevel, S.; G√∂bel, E. (1990). \\"Picosecond stimulated photon echo due to intrinsic excitations in semiconductor mixed crystals\\".

Physical Review B 47 (3): 1532‚Äì1539. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.47.1532 it is essential to include many-body effects in the theoretical analysis since they may qualitatively alter the dynamics. For example, numerical solutions of the SBEs have demonstrated that the dynamical reduction of the band gap which originates from the Coulomb interaction among the photoexcited electrons and holes is able to generate a photon echo even for resonant excitation of a single discrete exciton resonance with a pulse of sufficient intensity.Lindberg, M.; Binder, R.; Koch, S. (1992). \\"Theory of the semiconductor photon echo\\". Physical Review A 45 (3): 1865‚Äì1875. doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.45.1865 Besides the rather simple effect of inhomogeneous broadening, spatial fluctuations of the energy, i.e., disorder, which in semiconductor nanostructure may, e.g., arise from imperfection of the interfaces between different materials, can also lead to a decay of the photon echo amplitude with increasing time delay. To consistently treat this phenomenon of disorder induced dephasing the SBEs need to be solved including biexciton correlations. As shown in Ref.Weiser, S.; Meier, T.; M√∂bius, J.; Euteneuer, A.; Mayer, E.; Stolz, W.; Hofmann, M.; R√ºhle, W.; Thomas, P.; Koch, S. (2000). \\"Disorder-induced dephasing in semiconductors\\". Physical Review B 61 (19): 13088‚Äì13098. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.61.13088 such a microscopic theoretical approach is able to describe disorder induced dephasing in good agreement with experimental results. The excitonic optical Stark effect In a pump-probe experiment one excites the system with a pump pulse (E_p) and probes its dynamics with a (weak) test pulse (E_t). With such experiments one can measure the so-called differential absorption \\\\Delta \\\\alpha (\\\\omega) which is defined as the difference between the probe absorption in the presence of the pump \\\\alpha_{\\\\text{pump on}} (\\\\omega) and the probe absorption without the pump \\\\alpha_{\\\\text{pump off}} (\\\\omega). For resonant pumping of an optical resonance and when the pump precedes the test, the absorption change \\\\Delta \\\\alpha is usually negative in the vicinity of the resonance frequency. This effect called bleaching arises from the fact that the excitation of the system with the pump pulse reduces the absorbance of the test pulse. There may also be positive contributions to \\\\Delta \\\\alpha spectrally near the original absorption line due to resonance broadening and at other spectral positions due to excited-state absorption, i.e., optical transitions to states such as biexcitons which are only possible if the system is in an excited state. The bleaching and the positive contributions are generally present in both coherent and incoherent situations where the polarization vanishes but occupations in excited states are present. For detuned pumping, i.e., when the frequency of the pump field is not identical with the frequency of the material transition, the resonance frequency shifts as a result of the light- matter coupling, an effect known as the optical Stark effect. The optical Stark effect requires coherence i.e., a non vanishing optical polarization induced be the pump pulse, and thus decreases with increasing time delay between the pump and probe pulses and vanishes if the system has returned to its ground state. As can be shown by solving the optical Bloch equations for a two-level system due to the optical Stark effect the resonance frequency should shift to higher values, if the pump frequency is smaller than the resonance frequency and vice versa. This is also the typical result of experiments performed on excitons in semiconductors. Fr√∂hlich, D.; N√∂the, A.; Reimann, K. (1985). \\"Observation of the Resonant Optical Stark Effect in a Semiconductor\\".

(1986). \\"Optical Stark effect on excitons in GaAs quantum wells\\". Optics Letters 11 (10): 609. doi:10.1364/OL.11.000609 The fact that in certain situations such predictions which are based on simple models fail to even qualitatively describe experiments in semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures has received significant attention. Such deviations are because in semiconductors typically many-body effects dominate the optical response and therefore it is required to solve the SBEs instead of the optical Bloch equations to obtain an adequate understanding. An important example was presented in Ref.Sieh, C.; Meier, T.; Jahnke, F.; Knorr, A.; Koch, S.; Brick, P.; H√ºbner, M.; Ell, C.; Prineas, J.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. (1999). \\"Coulomb Memory Signatures in the Excitonic Optical Stark Effect\\". Physical Review Letters 82 (15): 3112‚Äì3115. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.82.3112 where it was shown that many-body correlations arising from biexcitons are able to reverse the sign of the optical Stark effect. In contrast to the optical Bloch equations, the SBEs including coherent biexcitonic correlations were able to properly describe the experiments performed on semiconductor quantum wells. Superradiance of excitons Consider N two-level systems at different positions in space. Maxwell's equations lead to a coupling among all the optical resonances since the field emitted from a specific resonance interferes with the emitted fields of all other resonances. As a result, the system is characterized by N eigenmodes originating from the radiatively coupled optical resonances. A spectacular situation arises if N identical two- level systems are regularly arranged with distances that equals an integer multiple of \\\\lambda/2, where \\\\lambda is the optical wavelength. In this case, the emitted fields of all resonances interfere constructively and the system behaves effectively as a single system with a N-times stronger optical polarization. Since the intensity of the emitted electromagnetic field is proportional to the squared modulus of the polarization, it scales initially as N^2. Due to the cooperativity that originates from the coherent coupling of the subsystems, the radiative decay rate \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} is increased by N, i.e., \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{rad}} = N \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{rad},0} where \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{rad},0} is the radiative decay of a single two-level system. Thus the coherent optical polarization decays N-times faster proportional to \\\\mathrm{e}^{- N \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathrm{rad},0} \\\\, t} than that of an isolated system. As a result the time integrated emitted field intensity scales as N, since the initial N^2 factor is multiplied by \\\\frac{1}{N} which arises from the time integral over the enhanced radiative decay. This effect of superradianceDicke, R. (1954). \\"Coherence in Spontaneous Radiation Processes\\". Physical Review 93 (1): 99‚Äì110. doi:10.1103/PhysRev.93.99 has been demonstrated by monitoring the decay of the exciton polarization in suitably arranged semiconductor multiple quantum wells. Due to superradiance introduced by the coherent radiative coupling among the quantum wells, the decay rate increases proportional to the number of quantum wells and is thus significantly more rapid than for a single quantum well.

Physical Review Letters 76 (22): 4199‚Äì4202. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.4199 The theoretical analysis of this phenomenon requires a consistent solution of Maxwell's equations together with the SBEs. Concluding remarks The few examples given above represent only a small subset of several further phenomena which demonstrate that the coherent optical response of semiconductors and semiconductor nanostructures is strongly influenced by many-body effects. Other interesting research directions which similarly require an adequate theoretical analysis including many-body interactions are, e.g., phototransport phenomena where optical fields generate and/or probe electronic currents, the combined spectroscopy with optical and Terahertz field, see article Terahertz spectroscopy and technology, and the rapidly developing area of semiconductor quantum optics, see article Semiconductor quantum optics with dots.

He was the adopted son of Malhar Rao Holkar, he was the second son of Shrimant Tanuji Holkar, a nephew of Malhar Rao Holkar. Thus he was also the grand-nephew of Malhar Rao Holkar. He married two wives. He had four sons Malhar Rao, Kashirao, Vithojirao & Yashwantrao Holkar. Life After the demise of Ahilyabai Holkar, Tukojirao was the only suitable person who could preserve the splendour of Holkar kingdom intact. He became the fourth ruler of the kingdom for a short period from 1795 to 1797 and protected the province as a courageous soldier. The credit of all triumphant Devi Ahilya enjoyed during her regime actually goes to Shremant Tukojirao Holkar. It was a time of crisis when Shreemant Tukojirao received the responsibility of the Holkar Kingdom. Shreemant Khanderao, husband of Devi Ahilyabai had already lost his life in Kumbher war of 1754. Shreemant Tujojirao Holkar was the most trustworthy commander-in-chief of Shreemant Malharrao Holkar. While on death bed, Malhar Rao's appreciation of Tukoji further intensified his loyalty to the royal house of Holkars. Malharrao said \\"You are the only one who can uphold my name and protect Prince Male Rao Holkar (grandson of Malharrao) after my death\\". But, Malerao also had a very short-life span. He died on 13 March 1767 due to sickness. At this juncture, it was Tukojirao who has submitted himself to the service of Devi Ahilyabai and she could withstand with the challenges she had in the service of her people of Malwa. Ahilyabai also respected him as her brother-in-law as Tukojirao was the adopted son of Shreemant Malhar Rao Holkar I. The remarkable and sincere services rendered by Tukoji Rao Holkar I during the reign of Malhar Rao Holkar I as a Commander in his army and during Ahilyabai Holkar as a Commander-in-Chief could congregate much recognition to his extraordinary talents in administration and as a Chief of the armed forces. He, in the meantime, never forgot for a moment his original sense of obligation to the royal house of Holkars. He was more than obedient; he was dutiful, and all his actions were directed to please and conciliate the royal chair to which he was solely indebted for his high station. The people of Malwa felt themselves secure in the hands of Tukojirao Holkar I and the territories comprising the Holkar State continued to be prosperous for nearly two years after the death of Ahilya Bai. One of his famous conquests was the Battle of Lahore, Attock, and Peshawar in which he commanded many of the Maratha forces in the Punjab region and the frontier regions of Attock and Peshawar. Tukoji Rao died on 15 August 1797. He left behind him \\"the character of a good soldier, a plain, unaffected man and one whose courage was superior to his craft.

Venzke qualified for the Olympic final at 1500 meters in 1936 and set indoor world records at both 1500 meters and the mile. Career Gene Venzke had a long career, placing in the top five at the national outdoor championships ten times between 1930 and 1940. His greatest successes, however, came indoors, as he was national champion in 1932, 1933 and 1936 and also set a number of world records. Venzke was in excellent shape during the 1932 indoor season. On February 6 he broke the indoor mile world record of Paavo Nurmi and Joie Ray with a clocking of 4:11.2 at the Millrose Games in New York. He improved to 4:10.0 eleven days later at the Baxter Mile, also in New York. On February 27 he broke the 1500 m world record with a time of 3:53.4. Despite his age he was still in high school at the time, having dropped out for several years. On June 18 Venzke broke the American outdoor record at Cambridge, running 3:52.6. He was considered extremely likely to make the Olympic team. However, he had already lost his best shape, having pulled a muscle in training, and at the Olympic Trials he only placed 4th, missing out by one place; he was still among the leaders with a hundred yards to go, but was passed in the final straight by Norwood Hallowell, Frank Crowley and finally Glenn Cunningham. At the 1933 indoor championships Venzke beat the Olympic fourth placer, Cunningham, in 3:55.4. But again he failed to maintain his best shape into the summer; at the outdoor championships he was only third and Cunningham broke his American record. Venzke's main rivals in 1934 and 1935 were Cunningham and Princeton University's Bill Bonthron. At the 1934 NCAA championships Venzke, now a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, placed third behind these two. At the national championships Venzke ran 1500 meters in 3:50.5; however, this was only good enough for third place as Bonthron broke the world record. At the 1935 championships he took second behind Cunningham. Venzke regained his national indoor title in 1936, scoring a close win over Cunningham in a world record time of 3:49.9. At the outdoor championships he was again beaten to third behind Cunningham and Emporia State's Archie San Romani; however, he defeated Bonthron, who was fourth. At the Olympic Trials the following week the same men took the four top spots in the same order, with Venzke in third making the Olympic team ahead of Bonthron. At the Olympics Venzke won his heat and placed 9th in the final. After the Olympics, he was part of a United States relay team (with Chuck Hornbostel, San Romani and Cunningham) that set a new world record of 17:17.2 in the 4 x Mile relay. He stayed in good shape for many more years, running his personal mile best of 4:08.2 in 1940. Originally from a poor family, Venzke made money as an investor and opened a golf range in Reiffton, Pennsylvania after finally retiring from running.

Metastasio based the background of the story on late Classical works by Cassius Dio (Book 19 of the Roman History) and Elio Sparziano (Vita Hadriani Caesaris). The aria Che fa il mio bene? also known as L'amante impaziente, sung by the character Emirena, was set to music by Ludwig van Beethoven in his Opus 82: 4 Arietten und ein Duett. Performances Bust of Sabina (Collection of the Getty Center, Los Angeles) The libretto was composed for Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and premiered in the Theater am K√§rntnertor in Vienna on 4 November 1732. The scenes were designed by Antonio Galli da Bibiena (1697‚Äì1774). A revised version was first performed in 1733, with music by Giacomelli. Some of the later operas based on this libretto were also created for royal festivities: the version by Pergolesi was intended for the birthday of Elisabeth Farnese, the Queen of Spain, and premiered at the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples on 25 October 1734, with the castrato Caffarelli singing the part of Farnaspe, which was radically altered from the first version of just two years earlier. In the yet again altered version of 1735 by Francesco Maria Veracini, written for the short-lived but ambitious Opera of the Nobility in London, the same role was sung by Farinelli, joined in an all-star cast by Senesino, Francesca Cuzzoni and Antonio Montagnana (Burden 2007, 31). George Frederic Handel was present at the premiere in Haymarket Theatre. Charles Jennens liked the opera and ordered a score; Lord Hervey, not known for his musical perception, and Henry Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth were bored (Dean 2006, 278‚Äì79; Van Til 2007, 121). However, the work enjoyed a run of twenty performances over six months (Helyard 2000). In 1768-69, Ignaz Holzbauer also composed an opera based on the libretto by Metastasio, this time to be performed at the royal wedding between Amalie of Zweibr√ºcken-Birkenfeld and Frederick Augustus I of Saxony on 29 January 1769. The 1765 version by Johann Christian Bach, while not especially created for a royal occasion, was even visited twice by George III of the United Kingdom and his wife Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz when it was performed in London in 1765. As a royalist or even imperialist opera, it was badly received by Republicans and revolutionaries. In 1792, √âtienne M√©hul had finished his version Adrien with a libretto by Fran√ßois-Beno√Æt Hoffman based on Metastasio; it was set to premier at the Paris Opera on 6 March 1792, but the Commune opposed it, as the opera was written by an Austrian (Anti- Austrian sentiments were running high at the time and France would declare war on Austria the next month), and the theme was imperialistic, which went against the ideals of the French Revolution. The premier was postponed for a week, and Hoffman defended his work in an open letter, but to no avail, as the work was banned on 12 March 1792. It finally premiered in 1799, but was again shut down by the Directory after four performances. Roles Parthian Empire *Adriano: governor of Syria, in love with Emirena *Emirena: prisoner of Adriano, in love with Farnaspe *Farnaspe: friend of Osroa and prince of the Parths, in love with and betrothed to Emirena *Osroa: King of the Parthian Empire, father of Emirena *Sabina: in love with and betrothed to Adriano *Aquilio: tribune, friend of Adriano and secretly in love with Sabina Synopsis Set in Antioch against the historic background of the time the future Roman Emperor Hadrian spent as Governor of Syria, it tells a fictional love story, where the virtue of Adriano is tested by his infatuation with Emirena, a Parthian princess, both before and after his marriage to Sabina. One of the subplots in the story is the attempt by Osroa to kill Adriano in a fire. Eventually, all ends well, Osroa is spared, Farnaspe marries Emirena, and Adriano returns to the love of his wife Sabina.

Between 1922 and 1945 the building was used as a school house, church and community center building. The school closed in 1945. It was a residence for a county worker and his family from 1947 to 1977. The Friends of the Black Forest Log School was formed to save and restore the building. By 2000, the restoration of the school house was completed and, it is now used for community activities and tours. History School house The one-room school house was built in 1920-1921 by Black Forest community residents, who also provided the land and building materials. It was the first public building in the Black Forest area. The building, 32 by 22 feet, was constructed with Ponderosa logs. The school room was heated by a coal burning stove with a red brick chimney. It had a well and an outhouse. Children were taught the first to eighth grades beginning in the fall of 1922. In addition to education of children, the building was also used as a church on Sundays, a summer Bible school for children in the summer, and for other events. In 1925, an addition was added to the front of the building for a cloakroom and to store coal. The school closed in 1945 and was consolidated with other rural schools, such as the Forest View School which was 5 miles to the southeast of the Black Forest School. Residence From 1947 to 1977 the school house was the residence of a man who worked for the county road commission and his family. In 1947, the building was converted to a 2 bedroom home with a living room and kitchen. Electricity was brought into the home, a septic system was added and a new well was dug for the home. Indoor plumbing was installed in one side of the addition in 1951, and a utility room was added to the other side in 1975. The property was abandoned by the county in 1981. Restoration After the school house had been abandoned, the volunteer Friends of the Black Forest Log School began work to have the school restored. In 1992, they submitted an application to the National Register of Historic Places. Community residents volunteered time and donated monies to restore the school. Boy scouts replaced chinking and stained the logs. The Colorado Historical Fund provided funds for much of the major renovation work. It took 2 years to complete the work on the interior. Some of the original structure remains, such as all but 2 of the original logs and the wooden floor. A new foundation was built to solve a drainage problem. The school house was restored by 2000 with a pot-bellied stove, chalkboard, desks, coal, toys and school supplies. The school house is used for community activities, such as \\"pot lucks, story times and holiday events.\\" Tours are given by the Friends of the Black Forest Log School from 12 to 3 on Thursdays in the summer. The Friends of the Black Forest Log School was incorporated in 2009. Anniversary celebration In 2012, a 90th anniversary celebration was held during the summer. The building had several public openings and celebrations, including games of hopscotch, tug of war and jump rope. Other log buildings Near the school house are other log buildings, including a Black Forest store built in the late 1920s, a Community Hall completed in 1929, and a log church completed in 1940.

Until September 2010 a contingent of United States Air Force personnel of the 607th Materiel Maintenance Squadron served in a co-located operating base on Gimhae Air Base. History The base was originally established during the Korean War as Pusan West (K-1) Air Base and hosted United States Air Force and United States Marine Corps units. On 25 June 1950, 10 divisions of the North Korean People's Army attacked the Republic of Korea. The North Koreans quickly overwhelmed the South Korean Army and moved south. Following the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 83 on 27 June 1950, President Truman ordered US forces to defend the Republic of Korea. On 30 June 1950 C-54s of the Fifth Air Force began transporting a battalion of the 24th Infantry Division from Itazuke Air Base to K-1, however the weight of the C-54s damaged the runway and later flights were made using C-47s. On 2 July the Battalion, known as Task Force Smith, boarded trains to Taejon and was destroyed on 4 July in the Battle of Osan. On 7 July 1950 two L-5s and an SC-47 from the 3rd Air Rescue Squadron (3rd ARS) deployed to K-1 from Ashiya AB in Japan, but the aircraft proved unsuitable for the terrain and returned to Japan on 16 July. On 30 August, the 3rd ARS formally organized Detachment F, with six H-5s at K-1. Following the success of the Inchon landing Detachment F moved north to Seoul (K-16) Air Base. On 24 December 1950 the Air Defense Section of Marine Tactical Air Control Squadron 2 was deployed to K-1 to establish a tactical air command center. By April 1951 K-1 served as the headquarters of the First Marine Air Wing and Marine Aircraft Group 12 was based at K-1 to provide aircraft for combat missions and special missions. VMA-513 flying F7Fs and F4U-5Ns were flying out of K-1 and providing the sole night fighter air defense and interdiction support to all UN forces in Korea. On 31 May 1951 a US Navy R5D-3 #56513 hit a mountain at the end of the base killing all 5 passengers and crew. In November 1951 the 1903rd Aviation Engineer Battalion arrived at K-1 and relieved the First Marine Air Wing of all responsibilities for maintaining the base and runways. Maintenance responsibility was later assumed by the 366th Aviation Battalion. A ROKAF Tachikawa Ki-9 at K-1 in 1951 From October to December 1952, the 17th Bombardment Wing was based at K-1 to allow for the resurfacing of the Pusan East (K-9) Air Base runway from PSP to asphalt.

Despot S. Bad≈æoviƒá (, ) (1850 ‚Äî 30 November 1930) was a teacher and an activist of the Serbian national movement in Macedonia. Badzovic was also one of the early Macedonists, who developed some kind of pro-Serbian Slav Macedonian identity.Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov eds., Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, Balkan Studies Library, RILL, 2013, , p. 317.  Teacher in Kru≈°evo  Despot Bad≈æoviƒá and his brother ƒêorƒëe graduated at the Second Department of the Belgrade Orthodox Seminary founded by Milo≈° Milojeviƒá. In 1871 Bad≈æoviƒá opened a Serbian school in Kru≈°evo for about 60 students where he and his brother ƒêorƒëe were the first teachers. ƒêorƒëe left the school in 1875 to become a teacher in Smilevo, and Despot left in 1876 to live in Serbia. Their brother Kuzman and his wife, Jelena Bad≈æoviƒá, replaced them as teachers.  Move to Serbia  During the Serbian-Ottoman War Bad≈æoviƒá distinguished himself by mobilizing volunteers who illegally crossed the border to join Serbian forces and as a company commander. After the war ended in February 1877, Despot became a scribe in the Pƒçinja District. On 20 May 1877 Bad≈æoviƒá was in the delegation of ‚ÄúSerbs of Old Serbia\\" who asked the government of Serbia to liberate and unite Old Serbia with the Principality of Serbia. They also informed representatives of the Great Powers and the Emperor of Russia of their demands. In the same year Bad≈æoviƒá became a member of the Committee for the Liberation of Old Serbia and Macedonia. On 20 May 1879 Bad≈æoviƒá suggested to the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs that Serbian forces should enter Macedonia to incite rebellion against the Ottomans.  Alphabet books  At the end of 1879, with approval of Matija Ban, Bad≈æoviƒá published the 'Alphabet Book for Serbo-Macedonian Primary Schools' () written on \\"Serbo-Macedonian dialect\\". Matija Ban proposed to the government of Serbia to establish the Main Board with eight members who would maintain the connection with smaller sub boards in smaller places in the Old Serbia and Macedonia. Minister of Education Vladan ƒêorƒëeviƒá engaged Bad≈æoviƒá to participate in composing of the alphabet book for the Serbian Schools in Macedonia.

In the Ottoman Empire, Muslim Turkish women were not allowed to play on stage by a decree of the Ministry of the Interior. Only non-Muslim women of Greek, Armenian, or Jewish minorities were eligible for being cast. Afife's father was against a theatre career of her because he considered it unsound. For this reason, she ran away from her parents‚Äô house. She entered as a trainee the theatre of the newly established city conservatory (). The Conservatory had opened up a course to train Muslim women actresses with the rationale to play for women audience only. Afife debuted on stage in 1920, acting as \\"Emel\\" in the theatre play \\"Yamalar\\" written by H√ºseyin Suat. The role had become vacant as the Armenian Eliza Binemeciyan had gone abroad.

She had to be hidden at least twice by her non- Muslim co-actors during police raids in the middle of the play. The management of the conservatory was warned of the restriction that led to her discharge from the theatre in 1921. She then played in some other theatre companies under various stage names. She found herself in financial trouble, and began suffering acute headache. She became addicted to morphine after her doctor applied a morphine based therapy to her. In 1923, Mustafa Kemal, the founder of the newly proclaimed Republic, lifted the Ottoman-era ban on stage acting by Muslim women. This led to the end of Afife's fears. She joined the theatre again, and toured in Anatolia. However, her drug addiction caused the worsening of her health that ultimately led to her retirement from the theatre. Family life She was born in 1902 in Istanbul to Hidayet and his wife Methiye. She had a sister Behiye and a brother Sal√¢h. Afife Jale became impoverished after leaving her acting career. In 1928, she met Selahattin Pƒ±nar (1902‚Äì1960), a tambur virtuoso, at a Turkish classical music concert she attended. The couple married in 1929, and moved to an apartment in Fatih district of Istanbul. The marriage life did not go well, and the couple divorced in 1935 when Afife's morphine addiction affected their marriage negatively. Selahattin Pƒ±nar composed a number of musical pieces, which later became classical, referring to his relationship with her wife during their marriage. Concerned about her substance dependence, Jale's friends from the conservatory took her to the Bakƒ±rk√∂y Psychiatric Hospital for therapy. She spent her last years in the hospital, where she died on July 24, 1941. Her burial place was forgotten. Legacy In 1987, journalist Nezihe Araz (1922‚Äì2009) wrote a theatre play titled \\"Afife Jale\\", which was played on stage and turned into a film. Afife Jale's tragic life was depicted twice in the cinema, first in the 1987 movie Afife Jale directed by ≈ûahin Kaygun, and later in Ceyda Aslƒ± Kƒ±lƒ±√ßkƒ±ran's 2008 movie Kilit, with M√ºjde Ar starring in both. Premiering in December 1998, the \\"Modern Dance Company\\" of the Turkish State Opera and Ballet performed a contemporary ballet suite Afife composed by Turgay Erdener and choreographed by Beyhan Murphy. The two-act work dramatizes Afife's life in four scenes with the colors of gold (youth), red (struggle), purple (addiction), and silver (death). The ballet was performed again in 2012 at the S√ºreyya Opera House in Kadƒ±k√∂y. The 2000 released music album Afife contains classical music song by soprano Selva Erdener accompanied by Tchaikovsky Symphony Orchestra of Moscow Radio. A documentary movie \\"Y√ºzyƒ±lƒ±n a≈üklarƒ±: Afife ve Selahattin\\" by Can D√ºndar, depicting her marriage with Selahattin Pƒ±nar, was broadcast in 2004 on the channel CNN T√ºrk. At the Ortak√∂y neighborhood of the Be≈üikta≈ü district of Istanbul, a cultural center, the \\"Afife Jale K√ºlt√ºr Merkezi\\", and a theatre stage, the \\"Afife Jale Sahnesi\\", are named after her. Since 1997, the Afife Jale Theatre Award, established by the insurance company Yapƒ± Kredi Sigorta, is given to distinguished theatre actors annually in her honor.

In the first of these, the pastor Benigno is called by Mary of Nazareth and Joseph to take care of the newborn baby Jesus, who proves to be a brat. He performs a spiteful miracle series, including that of floating in the tub where he has to swim. Benigno confesses to the baby to being hopelessly in love with Mary, but he has to resign, because the Madonna has now taken a husband. The tramp Benigno desperately searches for his beloved angel of heaven named Angela. When he gets information from other angels about the pure soul, Benigno discovers that she is in love with God, and that the two are getting married. The unemployed Benigno goes to the bank to get a loan for the purchase of a home. He is sent by the bank manager, but Benigno doesn't understand the system of bank lending, leading to a series of comical misunderstandings. At the end the manager is exasperated and orders to put Benigno in jail. The two soldiers Benigno and Claudio are doing the night guard in Rome, at the Altar of the Fatherland, the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

He then received his law degree from Georgetown University Law Center and was admitted to the Connecticut Bar. He practiced law in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1973, he was appointed to the Connecticut Superior Court, and later held the office of Chief Administrative Judge for the Connecticut Judicial Marshal Services. Early years After graduating from St Patrick's School in 1951, Ford attended high school at Fairfield College Preparatory School, Connecticut. Following graduation from the University of Notre Dame, he became a law graduate from the Georgetown University in 1958 and joined the Connecticut Bar in February 1959. Career span Ford worked for law firms like the Keogh and Candee in Norwalk and the Bridgeport law firm of Clancy and Kenney, also becoming a partner in the latter. 1962 saw his appointment to public defender in Fairfield County and Superior Court Judge in 1973, as designated by Governor Thomas J. Meskill. He became a Senior Judge in 2003. Judge Ford, reputed for his \\"fair but firm\\" justice, has been described as \\"Mr. Clean in a black robe\\". Notable cases * In 1967 Ford was assistant public defender for Harlis Miller, in a case that had national coverage. * In 1987 Ford presided over the trial of serial killer Michael Ross. The accounts of Karen Clarke of The Day are stored at the Connecticut State Library in Hartford. * In 1997 Ford was the sole dissenter in the 11-1 censure vote of Harold H. Dean, at the time the state's most senior Superior Court judge. * In 2000 Ford presided on the Adrian Peeler case and also split Adrian Peeler's case from his brother Russell Peeler, due to evidence in the shooting of the witnesses. Ford also presided on the case against Russell Peeler who was found guilty of ordering two murders. Ford's imposition of a life sentence when the jury deadlocked on a decision on the death penalty was later overturned in 2004 by the Connecticut Supreme Court which ordered a new sentencing hearing after appeal by the prosecutors on the case. The conviction, itself, was upheld. At a new sentencing hearing in 2007, Russell Peeler was sentenced to death, and later, in 2016, became the second formerly condemned prisoner resentenced to life in prison after Connecticut abolished the death penalty for already sentenced prisoners in 2015. Said Ford at Russell Peeler's sentencing: He doesn't deserve any consideration. He cannot be expected to be rehabilitated and be put back on the street and stay away from the criminal element. ... I'd be a fool to expect that. * In 2001, Ford presided over an unusual incident where a not guilty verdict was delivered but the accused had fled the courthouse.

In 1924 he was designated a Meritorious Artist of the Republic. Biography Israil Levenson was born in the town of Kobeliaky, Poltava Governorate, to the family of a Jewish teacher. Aged twelve he made a journey to Kiev where he started to perform, singing in cafes and restaurants. One of the musicians he made friends with, Ippolit Pryanishnikov helped the young man to join the Kiev opera choir. After studying for two years under Camille Everardi, in 1892 Alexander Davydov made his debut at the Tiflis opera. Then he developed a passion to operetta and started travelling from one city to another, performing in local theatres. In 1900 he joined the Saint Petersburg's Mariinsky Theatre and made his debut there as Hermann in The Queen of Spades to huge critical and popular acclaim. Davydov, the most popular male Russian singer of his generation, made about 400 gramophone recordings in 1901-1912. His huge repertoire included 85 operas and 30 operettas. In 1909 Sergey Dyagilev invited now famous Davydov to take part in his Russian Seasons in Paris. In 1914 due to progressing deafness Davydov was forced to quit opera but continued to perform, singing popular songs and romances. In 1924 he departed to France and was invited by Fyodor Chalyapin to become the artistic director of his opera troupe. In 1935 Davydov returned to the USSR. In his later years he taught vocals at Mariinsky Theatre (known at the time as the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre) and published memoirs on Tchaikovsky and Chalyapin, among many other musicians and composers he'd met.

Plot It should be an easy day's work for former black ops operative Cross (Steven Seagal) and his partner Manning (Stone Cold Steve Austin). They and their group have been hired to oversee and orchestrate the decommissioning of a secret military penal facility, and organize the transport of the inmates to their new civilian prison. Cross shows who's boss early on by beating up a large inmate who steps out of line, while Manning is given the task of running the prison's garbage facility. The day gets worse when a rolled up note is found that was accidentally dropped by an inmate, detailing times and locations for an attack on the facility. Cross, on his way back to the prison from running an errand, and Manning, still dealing with that garbage facility, are suddenly involved in a foothold situation as Chris Blake (Michael Pare) and his mercenaries, posing as marshals, take over the complex. Blake and his men are after the two newest inmates‚ÄîSamantha Mendez (Steph Song) and Charlotte Walker (Aliyah O'Brien)‚Äîfor their own purposes‚ÄîBlake wants the information that's in an implant that's inside of Samantha, who is a CIA courier, because it could lead to a lot of money for Blake, and it turns out that Charlotte is working for Blake. It's up to Cross, Manning, and their team to stop Blake and his men. MP Fields turns out to be a traitor and kills two of the others. Blake cuts off Warden Samuel's finger to force him to know where the detainees are. Manning is attacked Collins and his team. He manages to kill two and flee the area. Cross returns to the complex and kills two of Blake's men. Blake holds Warden Samuels hostage, forcing him to do anything so Blake can reach Charlotte. Later on Charlotte escapes as she wants to get paid. Eventually both sides meet up. Blake thinks he has Cross and Manning outgunned and then flees the scene, with Cross pursuing him. Manning catches up with Collins and kills him by impaling him on a bench. Samantha kills Charlotte, while the remnants of Blake's mercenaries including MP Fields are killed by Bradley and the others. Cross and Blake exchange gunshots till both run out of ammo. Blake attempts to strike Cross only to be thrashed around and badly injured. Cross talks to him about being a warrior in which Blake replies 'well that's me im the f***ing bad guy'. Cross says he's the good guy then hurls Blake into the laser trip wires, killing him. He reunites with Samantha and Manning. He jokes that 'in ain't over till we're dead'.

This method is well suited for producing a closed set of numerically computable equations that can be applied to analyze a great variety of many-body and/or quantum-optical problems. For example, it is widely applied in semiconductor quantum opticsKira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. and it can be applied to generalize the semiconductor Bloch equations and semiconductor luminescence equations. Background Quantum theory essentially replaces classically accurate values by a probabilistic distribution that can be formulated using, e.g., a wavefunction, a density matrix, or a phase-space distribution. Conceptually, there is always, at least formally, probability distribution behind each observable that is measured. Already in 1889, a long time before quantum physics was formulated, Thorvald N. Thiele proposed the cumulants that describe probabilistic distributions with as few quantities as possible; he called them half-invariants.Lauritzen, S. L. (2002). Thiele: Pioneer in Statistics. Oxford Univ. Press. The cumulants form a sequence of quantities such as mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and so on, that identify the distribution with increasing accuracy as more cumulants are used. The idea of cumulants was converted into quantum physics by Fritz CoesterCoester, F. (1958). \\"Bound states of a many-particle system\\".

Nuclear Physics 17: 477‚Äì485. doi:10.1016/0029-5582(60)90140-1 with the intention of studying nuclear many- body phenomena. Later, Ji≈ôi ƒå√≠≈æek and Josef Paldus extended the approach for quantum chemistry in order to describe many-body phenomena in complex atoms and molecules. This work introduced the basis for the coupled-cluster approach that mainly operates with many-body wavefunctions. The coupled-clusters approach is one of the most successful methods to solve quantum states of complex molecules. In solids, the many-body wavefunction has an overwhelmingly complicated structure such that the direct wave-function-solution techniques are intractable. The cluster expansion is a variant of the coupled-clusters approachKira, M.; Koch, S. (2006). \\"Quantum-optical spectroscopy of semiconductors\\". Physical Review A 73 (1). doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.73.013813 and it solves the dynamical equations of correlations instead of attempting to solve the quantum dynamics of an approximated wavefunction or density matrix. It is equally well suited to treat properties of many-body systems and quantum-optical correlations, which has made it very suitable approach for semiconductor quantum optics. Like almost always in many-body physics or quantum optics, it is most convenient to apply the second-quantization formalism to describe the physics involved. For example, a light field is then described through Boson creation and annihilation operators \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_\\\\mathbf{q} and \\\\hat{B}_\\\\mathbf{q}, respectively, where \\\\hbar\\\\mathbf{q} defines the momentum of a photon. The \\"hat\\" over B signifies the operator nature of the quantity. When the many-body state consists of electronic excitations of matter, it is fully defined by Fermion creation and annihilation operators \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mathbf{k}} and \\\\hat{a}_{\\\\lambda,\\\\mathbf{k}}, respectively, where \\\\hbar\\\\mathbf{k} refers to particle's momentum while \\\\lambda is some internal degree of freedom, such as spin or band index. Classification of N-particle contributions When the many-body system is studied together with its quantum-optical properties, all measurable expectation values can be expressed in the form of an N-particle expectation value \\\\langle \\\\hat{N} \\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_1 \\\\cdots \\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger_K \\\\ \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_1 \\\\cdots \\\\hat{a}^\\\\dagger_{N_{\\\\hat{a}}} \\\\hat{a}_{N_{\\\\hat{a}}} \\\\cdots \\\\hat{a}_{1} \\\\ \\\\hat{B}_{J} \\\\cdots \\\\hat{B}_1 \\\\rangle where N=N_{\\\\hat{B}} +N_{\\\\hat{a}} and N_{\\\\hat{B}}=J+K while the explicit momentum indices are suppressed for the sake of briefness. These quantities are normally ordered, which means that all creation operators are on the left-hand side while all annihilation operators are on the right-hand side in the expectation value. It is straight forward to show that this expectation value vanishes if the amount of Fermion creation and annihilation operators are not equal.Haug, H. (2006). Statistische Physik: Gleichgewichtstheorie und Kinetik. Springer. Bartlett, R. J. (2009). Many-Body Methods in Chemistry and Physics: MBPT and Coupled-Cluster Theory. Cambridge University Press. Once the system Hamiltonian is known, one can use the Heisenberg equation of motion to generate the dynamics of a given N-particle operator. However, the many-body as well as quantum-optical interactions couple the N-particle quantities to (N+1)-particle expectation values, which is known as the Bogolyubov‚ÄìBorn‚ÄìGreen‚ÄìKirkwood‚ÄìYvon (BBGKY) hierarchy problem. More mathematically, all particles interact with each other leading to an equation structure \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}\\\\rangle = \\\\mathrm{T}\\\\left[ \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}\\\\rangle \\\\right] + \\\\mathrm{Hi}\\\\left[ \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}+1\\\\rangle \\\\right] where functional T symbolizes contributions without hierarchy problem and the functional for hierarchical (Hi) coupling is symbolized by \\\\mathrm{Hi}[\\\\langle\\\\hat{N}+1\\\\rangle]. Since all levels of expectation values can be nonzero, up to the actual particle number, this equation cannot be directly truncated without further considerations. Recursive definition of clusters Schematic representation of the cluster-expansion-based classification. The full correlation is composed of singlets, doublets, triplets, and higher-order correlations, all uniquely defined by the cluster- expansion approach. Each blue sphere corresponds to one particle operator and yellow circles/ellipses to correlations. The number of spheres within a correlation identifies the cluster number. The hierarchy problem can be systematically truncated after identifying correlated clusters. The simplest definitions follow after one identifies the clusters recursively. At the lowest level, one finds the class of single-particle expectation values (singlets) that are symbolized by \\\\langle 1\\\\rangle. Any two-particle expectation value \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle can be approximated by factorization \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S} = \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle that contains a formal sum over all possible products of single-particle expectation values. More generally, \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle defines the singlets and \\\\langle N \\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S} is the singlet factorization of an N-particle expectation value. Physically, the singlet factorization among Fermions produces the Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation while for Bosons it yields the classical approximation where Boson operators are formally replaced by a coherent amplitude, i.e., \\\\hat{B} \\\\rightarrow \\\\langle \\\\hat{B} \\\\rangle. The singlet factorization constitutes the first level of the cluster-expansion representation. The correlated part of \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle is then the difference of the actual \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle and the singlet factorization \\\\langle 2 \\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}. More mathematically, one finds \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle where the \\\\Delta contribution denotes the correlated part, i.e., \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle-\\\\langle 2\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}. The next levels of identifications follow recursively by applying \\\\begin{align} \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle &= \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S} + \\\\langle 1\\\\rangle\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle +\\\\Delta \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle \\\\,, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\langle N\\\\rangle &= \\\\langle N\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+ \\\\langle N-2\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+ \\\\langle N-4\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle +\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+ \\\\langle N-3\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+ \\\\langle N-5\\\\rangle_\\\\mathrm{S}\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle\\\\ \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle +\\\\dots\\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\quad+ \\\\Delta\\\\langle N\\\\rangle\\\\,, \\\\end{align} where each product term represents one factorization symbolically and implicitly includes a sum over all factorizations within the class of terms identified. The purely correlated part is denoted by \\\\Delta\\\\langle N\\\\rangle. From these, the two-particle correlations \\\\Delta \\\\langle 2\\\\rangle determine doublets while the three-particle correlations \\\\Delta \\\\langle 3\\\\rangle are called triplets. As this identification is applied recursively, one may directly identify which correlations appear in the hierarchy problem. One then determines the quantum dynamics of the correlations, yielding \\\\mathrm{i}\\\\hbar \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}\\\\rangle = \\\\mathrm{T}\\\\left[ \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}\\\\rangle \\\\right] + \\\\mathrm{NL} \\\\left[\\\\langle\\\\hat{1}\\\\rangle, \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{2}\\\\rangle,\\\\cdots, \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}\\\\rangle \\\\right] \\\\+ \\\\mathrm{Hi}\\\\left[ \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{N}+1\\\\rangle \\\\right]\\\\,, where the factorizations produce a nonlinear coupling \\\\mathrm{NL} \\\\left[ \\\\cdots \\\\right] among clusters. Obviously, introducing clusters cannot remove the hierarchy problem of the direct approach because the hierarchical contributions remains in the dynamics. This property and the appearance of the nonlinear terms seem to suggest complications for the applicability of the cluster-expansion approach. However, as a major difference to a direct expectation-value approach, both many-body and quantum-optical interactions generate correlations sequentially.Mootz, M.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2012). \\"Sequential build-up of quantum-optical correlations\\". Journal of the Optical Society of America B 29 (2): A17. doi:10.1364/JOSAB.29.000A17 In several relevant problems, one indeed has a situation where only the lowest-order clusters are initially nonvanishing while the higher-order clusters build up slowly. In this situation, one can omit the hierarchical coupling, \\\\mathrm{Hi}\\\\left[ \\\\Delta \\\\langle\\\\hat{C}+1\\\\rangle \\\\right], at the level exceeding C-particle clusters. As a result, the equations become closed and one only needs to compute the dynamics up to C-particle correlations in order to explain the relevant properties of the system. Since C is typically much smaller than the overall particle number, the cluster-expansion approach yields a pragmatic and systematic solution scheme for many-body and quantum-optics investigations. Extensions Besides describing quantum dynamics, one can naturally apply the cluster-expansion approach to represent the quantum distributions. One possibility is to represent the quantum fluctuations of a quantized light mode \\\\hat{B} in terms of clusters, yielding the cluster-expansion representation. Alternatively, one can express them in terms of the expectation-value representation \\\\langle [\\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger]^J \\\\hat{B}^K \\\\rangle. In this case, the connection from \\\\langle [\\\\hat{B}^\\\\dagger]^J \\\\hat{B}^K \\\\rangle to the density matrix is unique but can result in a numerically diverging series. This problem can be solved by introducing a cluster-expansion transformation (CET)Kira, M.; Koch, S. (2008). \\"Cluster-expansion representation in quantum optics\\". Physical Review A 78 (2). doi:10.1103/PhysRevA.78.022102 that represents the distribution in terms of a Gaussian, defined by the singlet‚Äìdoublet contributions, multiplied by a polynomial, defined by the higher-order clusters. It turns out that this formulation provides extreme convergence in representation-to-representation transformations. This completely mathematical problem has a direct physical application. One can apply the cluster-expansion transformation to robustly project classical measurement into a quantum-optical measurement.Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Smith, R. P.; Hunter, A. E.; Cundiff, S. T. (2011). \\"Quantum spectroscopy with Schr√∂dinger-cat states\\". Nature Physics 7 (10): 799‚Äì804. doi:10.1038/nphys2091 This property is largely based on CET's ability to describe any distribution in the form where a Gaussian is multiplied by a polynomial factor. This technique is already being used to access and derive quantum-optical spectroscopy from a set of classical spectroscopy measurements, which can be performed using high-quality lasers.

Early life Taylor was born in Brighton on 25 January 1822, the youngest son of Major-General Thomas William Taylor CB of Ogwell, Devon, who served with the 10th Royal Hussars at the Battle of Waterloo. From Sandhurst, where his father was lieutenant-governor, he was commissioned as a cornet in the Indian cavalry on 26 February 1840.. In India Taylor first saw service with the 11th Bengal Light Cavalry in the Gwalior Campaign of 1843, and at the close of the war was appointed to the bodyguard. In the First Anglo-Sikh War he was severely wounded in a cavalry charge in the Battle of Mudki on 18 December 1845. Sent to Lahore in 1847, he became one of that famous body of men who worked under Henry Lawrence, and subsequently John Lawrence, in the Punjab. That same year he was left in charge of the city of Peshawar, leader of ten thousand Sikh troops and the whole district. Taylor organised a column of four thousand men who departed from Peshawar to occupy the Bannu District, and safely led the men through the Kohat Pass in November‚ÄìDecember 1847. Taylor was in charge of Bannu at the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Sikh War. When he heard reports of the murders of Patrick Vans Agnew and W. A. Anderson at Multan on 20 April 1848, he dispatched troops to assist Herbert Edwardes and remained at his post. In July he was ordered to proceed to Multan, which was at that time under siege, and then set out in an unsuccessful attempt to rescue British captives then being held at Peshawar. He next gathered an irregular force of 1,021 foot, 650 horse, and three guns, and laid siege to the fort of Lukkee, the key to the Derajat, on 11 December 1848. The fort was captured on 11 January 1849. For his services he was promoted captain on 15 December 1851 and major the next day.London Gazette, Issue 21344, 30 July 1852. Page 2. In 1855, after a prolonged visit to England, he was appointed commandant of the Corps of Guides. During the Indian Mutiny he was in charge of the Kangra district, and in 1859 he was appointed commissioner of the Derajat. He was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 21 December 1859, and in 1860 was chief political officer of the Waziri expedition. Before retiring from the Derajat, in order to become commissioner of Peshawar in the spring of 1862, he paid for the Church Missionary Society to establish a station in the district. The first head of the mission was Valpy French.Valpy French's entry in Dictionary of Indian Biography. In 1863 he served throughout the Ambela Campaign, was promoted to colonel on 3 April 1863, and received the Order of the Bath the following month.London Gazette, Issue 22735, 12 May 1863. Page 2. He was granted the Order of the Star of India in June 1866. After a short visit to England in 1865 he returned for the last time to India, to serve as commissioner of the Ambala district From 1870 he held the same post in the Amritsar division. Last years Taylor retired in 1877 as major-general. He was promoted lieutenant-general that year, and general on 15 December 1880. He died at Newton Abbot on 28 February 1886. A biography by Ernest Gambier-Parry was published in 1888. Family On 11 December 1854 Taylor married Ann, daughter of Arthur Holdsworth of Widdicombe, Devon.

Weiquan lawyers represents many cases regarding labour rights, land rights, official corruption, victims of torture, migrants' rights. Since the 1980s, as China's leadership became cognizant of the importance of the legal system and legal profession to advance economic development, training for lawyers dramatically increased. From 1986 to 1992, the number of lawyers in the country more than doubled from 21,500 to 45,000, and by 2008 had reached 143,000. The proportion of Weiquan lawyers is very small, relative the number of legal professionals in China. The number of lawyers actively focusing on civil rights issues has been estimated by legal scholar Teng Biao to number \\"only a few dozen.\\"Teng Biao, 'Chinese Human Rights Lawyers Under Assault', Washington Post, 25 July 2009. The lawyers face considerable personal and professional obstacles, and Weiquan lawyering demands substantial commitment to their cause. According to Fu Hualing and Richard Cullen, ‚ÄúWeiquan lawyers act principally out of commitment, not because of any financial concerns. They accept weiquan cases to pursue their cause, and typically charge no legal fees.‚Äù The lawyers often face threats, harassment, and even detention when taking on cases, and they find themselves targets of repression ahead of sensitive events.Jonathan Kaiman, China cracks down on dissent ahead of Tiananmen anniversary, The Guardian, 13 May 2014.  Types of Weiquan lawyers  Weiquan activists include law professors with university teaching positions‚Äîincluding He Weifang, Xu Zhiyong, and Teng Biao‚Äîprofessional lawyers, and ‚Äúbarefoot lawyers,‚Äù who are self-taught and often lack any formal legal education. Several of China's more high-profile Weiquan lawyers fall into the latter category, including Guo Feixiong and Chen Guangcheng. Many barefoot lawyers are peasants who teach themselves enough law to file civil complaints, engage in litigation, and educate fellow citizens about their rights. Because corporate law firms are generally not hospitable to Weiquan lawyers and legal aid workers operate within the government system, Weiquan lawyers in large cities tend to work as solo practitioners in partnership firms with other like-minded lawyers. The Beijing Global Law Firm and Yitong Law Firm are examples of such organizations. Rana Siu Inboden and William Inboden note that a disproportionate number of influential Weiquan lawyers identify with the Christian faith, including Gao Zhisheng, Chen Guangcheng, Zheng Enchong, and Li Heping, among others.  Different approaches  There are at least two distinctive (and sometimes competing) approaches to Weiquan activism. Among Weiquan lawyers, the pragmatists (or consequentialists) are more deferential to the existing legal systems and institutions, and only pursue courses of actions that are likely to produce incremental improvements and reforms.

She was completed in 1928 as SS Virginia, and refitted and renamed as SS Brazil in 1938. From 1942 to 1946 she was the War Shipping Administration operated troopship Brazil. She was laid up in 1958 and scrapped in 1964. Building Virginia was the second of three sister ships built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia for the American Line Steamship Corporation, which at the time was part of J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Co. She joined () in the fleet of American Lines' Panama Pacific Lines subsidiary. A third sister, SS Pennsylvania, was . Virginia was a steamship, with oil-fired furnaces heating her boilers to power two General Electric steam turbo generators with a combined rating of 2,833 NHP supplying current for her electric propulsion motors. Virginia was equipped with submarine signalling apparatus and wireless direction finding equipment, and from about 1934 she was equipped with a gyrocompass. As built, Virginia had accommodation for 184 first class and 365 tourist class passengers. 52 of her first class cabins were state rooms. Some of her first class cabins had en suite bathrooms. With Panama Pacific Lines, Virginias two funnels would have been red with a blue top, with a white band dividing the blue from the red. SS Virginia Panama Pacific Line, part of the American Line Steamship Corp, operated Pennsylvania and her sisters between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal until 1938. California, Virginia and Pennsylvania were subsidised to carry mail on this route for the United States Postal Service. In June 1937 the United States Congress withdrew all maritime mail subsidies, which by then included a total of $450,000 per year for Panama Pacific's three liners. At the beginning of March 1938 the Panama Canal tolls were revised, increasing Panama Pacific's costs by $37,000 per year. As a result of these cost increases and continuing labor difficulties Panama Pacific discontinued its New York ‚Äì California service and took all three liners out of service. SS Brazil The US Maritime Commission took over the three sister ships in 1937 and had them extensively refurbished. Each was fireproofed to comply with Federal safety regulations, which had been revised as a result of the fire in 1934 that destroyed the liner . Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's 56th St Shipyard in Brooklyn, New York undertook Virginias refit. She was given new watertight doors electrically controlled from her bridge and was equipped with a fathometer. Her well decks were closed in: the forward one to increase deck space and the after on to create a sheltered tourist class deck, a lido deck, a swimming pool and a first class veranda caf√©. Her 52 staterooms were combined to provide half that number of larger cabins. This revised her passenger capacity to 470. Her air conditioning was extended to the tourist class dining saloon. A modern laundry was installed to give passengers a 12-hour service. Her crew accommodation was completely rearranged. Virginia was equipped to carry of cargo, of which was refrigerated. She had been built with two funnels but during the refit this was reduced to one. The refit increased Virginias tonnage by about 2,000 tons. On 6 September 1938 Emmet McCormack, co-founder of Moore-McCormack Lines, declared > The South American trade, in so far as the United States is concerned, has > been touched only at its surface. With this ship [i.e. SS Virginia] and her > two sister liners in service the United States will be making a new bid for > its proper place in the South American field. They are larger than any other > American ships now serving South America and will be able, in conjunction > with our fleet of freight ships, to provide a speed that is now lacking. On 3 October 1938 Virginia, now renamed SS Brazil, successfully made her sea trials. The next day Moore-McCormack contracted to operate California, Virginia, Pennsylvania and 10 cargo ships between the USA and South America as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy. Moore- McCormack renamed the three passenger liners Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and assigned them to the fleet of its American Republics Lines subsidiary. With Moore-McCormack Lines Brazils funnel would have been buff with a black top. A broad green band divided the buff from the black. On each side of the funnel the green band bore a red capital M within a white disk. Moore- McCormack put the three sisters into service between New York and Buenos Aires via the Caribbean, Brazil and Montevideo. Brazil started from New York on her first voyage on the route on 15 November 1938, returning on 31 December with 141 passengers. Passenger numbers improved. On 18 September 1939 Brazil docked in New York from South America with 358 passengers. In April 1940 Brazil made a record run from Buenos Aires to New York in 14 days and 12 hours, achieving speeds of up to . On the trip she carried 273 passengers, of which 195 traveled first class. On 13 September 1940 Brazil sailed from Buenos Aires to New York with exiled Lithuanian composer Vytautas Bacevicius, aged 35, on the passenger list. On 28 September 1941 Brazil was leaving Buenos Aires when she accidentally struck a Spanish-owned freighter, the turbine steamship . No-one was injured and no damage was caused. Wartime civilian voyage On the morning of 6 December 1941 Brazil sailed from New York for South America carrying 316 passengers and a record amount of mail, between 8,000 and 9,000 sacks. The passengers included four Japanese diplomats, one of whom was accompanied by his wife. The next morning Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and on 8 December the USA declared war on Japan. As blackout precautions Brazils crew sealed and blacked out her portholes and painted her interior lights blue and purple. On 10 December Brazil arrived to make her scheduled call in Barbados, and British intelligence officers boarded her and removed the five Japanese. From 17 to 25 December the crew camouflaged Brazil with grey paint. In Rio de Janeiro they painted out the Stars and Stripes painted on each side of her hull, and then near Montevideo they painted her funnel gray. Brazil reached Buenos Aires on 23 December and the crew finished painting her gray all over on Christmas Day. Brazil then began a slow return voyage to the USA. She carried only 135 passengers, of whom 56 were Argentinian, Uruguayan and Brazilian aviation cadets on their way to be trained in the USA. This was Brazils last civilian voyage for six and a half years. Troop ship The War Shipping Administration had the ship, one of the large, fast vessels able to sail independently when required, converted into the Brazil for service carrying troops and operated the ship through its agents. On 19 March 1942 she sailed from Charleston, South Carolina carrying 4,000 United States Army troops via the Cape of Good Hope to Karachi, British India, where they arrived on 12 May. On 16 November 1942 Brazil left Oran, French Algeria carrying 44 Kriegsmarine prisoners of war: four officers and 40 ratings from . Lockheed Hudson aircraft of No. 608 Squadron RAF had attacked and damaged the U-boat on 14 November and the crew had scuttled her close to shore near T√©n√®s, about east of Oran. Brazil reached the USA on 30 November. On 11 December Brazil and one of her sister ships, , sailed from New Jersey carrying elements of the 2nd Armored Division. On 24 December they reached Casablanca in French Morocco. Brazil made two further voyages to North Africa and was then transferred to the Pacific. There her service included calls at Hobart, Tasmania; Honolulu; Bora Bora; Sydney and Bombay, before returning to San Francisco in July 1943. Brazil was then returned to transatlantic service, taking troops to the United Kingdom and France. In October 1944 she' arrived in Boston carrying US Army personnel and prisoners of war from Europe. On 22 October she sailed from Staten Island, New York carrying the 290th Infantry Regiment and the 258th Engineer Combat Battalion, reaching Swansea, Wales on 1 November. On 1 January 1945 Brazil sailed from New York as the flagship of the 57th Ship Convoy, reaching Le Havre on 15 January. On 16 June she departed Le Havre carrying the 97th Infantry Division across the Atlantic and up the Hudson River to Camp Shanks, New York, arriving on 24 June.1,463 of the 97th Steam Up Hudson: First Units of Second Combat Division Land Four Miles from Camp Shanks,\\" New York Times; June 24, 1945; p. 5. After a transatlantic voyage to Marseille in July 1945 Brazil was sent via the Panama Canal to Manila, and then made two transpacific voyages to bring troops home to the USA. Early in 1946 Brazil returned to transatlantic service. In March she provided \\"dependent transport\\" taking war brides and their children from Europe to the USA. She still had her cramped and spartan troopship accommodation, but on 12 June the Maritime Commission issued invitations to bid to convert Brazil back into a civilian ocean liner. On 4 August she completed her last voyage before reconversion, arriving at North River with 531 passengers from Le Havre; Southampton, England and Cobh, Ireland. Post-war The Atlantic Basin Iron Works of New York carried out Brazils conversion. It was the largest peacetime conversion that yard had yet undertaken, and cost $9 million. Brazils fireproofing was completely revised. Fire screen bulkheads, with and fire doors controlled from her bridge, divided her into 12 fire zones. She was fitted with a fire sprinkler system, and her water intakes were fitted with filters that would allow her to draw water from the muddy bottoms of South American harbors. Brazils accommodation was completely rebuilt with cabins for 359 first class and 160 cabin class passengers and designed by William F Schorn, who at the same time designed the new interior of her sister ship SS Uruguay. Brazil successfully made her sea trials in May 1948. The Maritime Commission restored her to Moore-McCormack Lines on 7 May: the last of the three sisters to return to civilian service. After her refit Brazils first class library was dedicated in memory of William Binder, Jr; a former Moore-McCormack employee who was killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. On 20 May Brazil sailed on her first civilian voyage since the war: a 12-day cruise to Bermuda and the Caribbean. On 4 June she left New York on the Buenos Aires run for the first time since 1941. On 10 December 1954 Brazil left New York on a scheduled run to Buenos Aires. One day out of port she developed engine trouble and had to return for repairs. As a result, she completed her round trip a week late, reaching New York on 24 January. This was the first time in her career that Brazil had been delayed by a technical fault. On 30 November 1957 the United States Federal Maritime Board approved Brazils withdrawal from service, to be replaced by a new and faster already under construction. The old Brazil and her sister ship Argentina were laid up as members of the James River Reserve Fleet at Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Uruguay had already been laid up since 1954. Late in 1963 the United States Department of Commerce offered Brazil for sale. In 1964 she was sold for $133,333 to Portsmouth Salvage, Inc for scrap. She was scrapped by First Steel and Ship Corporation of New York. Notable passengers Rear Admiral Robert C. Lee and his family holidayed aboard Brazil in 1938. Hortense Odlum, President of Bonwit Teller, sailed on Brazil, arriving in New York on 18 September 1939. On 14 May 1940 conductor Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra sailed aboard Brazil, reaching Rio de Janeiro on 12 June. During the voyage they performed a concert aboard that was broadcast live by radio. American fighter ace and Medal of Honor recipient, Pappy Boyington, returning from Burma after serving in the AVG (Flying Tigers), sailed from Karachi to New York in July 1942. Cartoonist Charles M. Schulz departed Boston aboard Brazil 5 February 1945. The conductor Victor de Sabata arrived in New York aboard Brazil on 5 September 1949. On 20 October 1949 Stanton Griffis, son of William Elliot Griffis, sailed on Brazil from New York to become US Ambassador to Argentina. James Farley, President of the Coca-Cola Export Corporation and former United States Postmaster General, sailed in Brazil in April 1951. Jo√£o Fernandes Campos Caf√© Filho, President of Brazil, visited the ship on 11 November 1954 and had lunch aboard.

Education South African political activist and teacher Marius Schoon was educated at the Afrikaans University of Stellenbosch, before moving to the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg for his postgraduate studies. While there he became a member of the South African Congress of Democrats (SACOD) in association with the African National Congress (ANC). Political activity In the early 1960s, Marius Schoon plotted to bomb the Hospital Hill Police Station in Johannesburg. His group included Mike Ngubeni and Raymond Thoms. An undercover police agent provocateur infiltrated Schoon's group and supplied them with a fake bomb with a view to entrapment. Schoon was arrested and sentenced to 12 years in Pretoria Local Prison. Schoon's first wife Diana committed suicide while Schoon was in prison. As an Afrikaner himself, Schoon was more hated than other anti-apartheid activists by the Afrikaner National Party government which had instituted the apartheid system. Authorities prevented him from attending Diana's funeral and from visiting their daughter Jane. Authorities released Schoon from prison in 1976 having served his full term without remission, with requirements to restrict his movements. Authorities declared Schoon a \\"banned\\" person, which meant he was prohibited from leaving home between 6 PM and 6 AM, and forbade him to teach or associate with other political activists. Bombed In June 1977, Schoon married Jeanette Curtis, a banned student and trade union activist, the sister of Neville Curtis. The couple feared for their safety in South Africa and moved to Botswana, first to the capital Gaborone, then to Molepolole, teaching at Kgari Sechele Secondary School, and later back to Gaborone where they jointly ran the Botswana branch of the [International Voluntary Service], all the while continuing to work for the anti-apartheid movement. They had two children: Katryn (1978) and Fritz (1981). During this time, internally within the African National Congress, the Schoons broke Craig Williamson's cover. He was an apartheid government spy named later publicly confirmed as a highly successful infiltrator of the liberation movements.http://www.justice.gov.za/trc/amntrans/1998/98110206_pre_98115pta.htm This allowed the ANC leadership to attempt to manipulate Williamson covertly for the movement's ends for a time. Later, following a warning from the United Kingdom's High Commissioner (ambassador) in Botswana that Marius was a target for assassination by the apartheid government security forces, the Schoon family moved to Angola via Lusaka, Zambia. Both Marius and Jeanette Schoon worked as university lecturers with the ANC in Lubango, Angola. On 28 June 1984, while Schoon was away, Jeanette Schoon collected‚Äîeither from their personal postbox or from the University mail office‚Äîand carried home a parcel bomb, which exploded on opening. It has not been established whether the bomb was addressed to Marius Schoon individually or to both the Schoons as a couple. The explosion killed her and their daughter Katryn. Their son Fritz, a toddler at the time, survived and was found wandering around the house. He never fully recovered from the trauma of seeing his mother and sister murdered before his eyes and developed epilepsy as a direct consequence. After the bombing, Schoon and son moved several times, first to Tanzania, then Zambia and eventually to Ireland. In 1986, Schoon married Sherry Mclean. Schoon returned to South Africa in 1990 after the ban on anti-apartheid parties was lifted. He died on 7 February 1999 from lung cancer, aged 61. Truth and Reconciliation Commission At the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Amnesty hearings, Craig Williamson admitted that as a security officer working for the apartheid government, he had sent the parcel bomb to Schoon's house in Angola and killed Schoon‚Äôs wife and daughter. At the TRC, Williamson's bomb-maker, Jerry Raven, testified: :\\"I did not know who the letters were intended for. It was only after the death of Jeanette Schoon and her child and the congratulations from Mr Williamson, that I realised that they had been the targets for one of the devices I had manufactured. On questioning Williamson about the Schoon incident he said that the letter had been intended for Marius Schoon but it served the[m] right. He alleged that the Schoons had always used their daughter as their bomb disposal expert. On requesting clarification he said that whenever they received suspicious parcels they would throw them in the back yard and let the child play with them until such time they deemed it fit to open them.\\" Schoon filed a civil suit against Williamson, seeking damages for his son Fritz. However, the suit was suspended pending Williamson‚Äôs Amnesty hearing. Schoon testified at Williamson‚Äôs hearing and is remembered for his strong stance against amnesty for the killer. He favoured justice over the Truth and Reconciliation Commission‚Äôs call for forgiveness, reconciliation and an amnesty. Williamson was granted amnesty in June 2000, a year after Schoon‚Äôs death, a decision his son appealed.

Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited novelist James Baldwin, along with a large group of cultural leaders, to meet in a Kennedy apartment in New York City. The meeting became antagonistic and the group reached no consensus. The black delegation generally felt that Kennedy did not understand the full extent of racism in the United States. Ultimately the meeting demonstrated the urgency of the racial situation and was a positive turning point in Kennedy's attitude towards the Civil Rights Movement. Background After formally abolishing slavery, the United States maintained a racist society through Jim Crow laws and other forms of systemic inequality. This racism became increasingly apparent due to many well- publicized instances of police violence against nonviolent direct actions. As the Birmingham campaign and Birmingham riot of 1963 brought negative attention to urban racism in the United States, Robert Kennedy wanted to prevent similar unrest from taking place in northern cities.Saucedo, The Fire Within (2004), pp. 89‚Äì90.Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), p. 330. Baldwin was reportedly already in contact with Kennedy on the topic of Birmingham, calling for an investigation into the role of the FBI and other federal agencies.\\"Kennedy Blamed By Baldwin\\", New York Times, May 13, 1963; accessed via ProQuest May 21, 2013. \\"LOS ANGELES, May 12 (AP)--James Baldwin, Negro novelist, visiting here for integration rallies, cabled Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy today, blaming J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Senator James O. Eastland, Democrat of Mississippi, and President Kennedy for the turmoil in Birmingham, Ala. Among other things he asserted that the President had \\"not used the great prestige of his office as the moral forum which it can be\\". Baldwin, already a popular novelist, had recently gained additional fame by virtue of The Fire Next Time, a book of two essays urging action against racism in America. Baldwin had become an iconic Black American, and Kennedy sought him out for advice on how to improve race relations.Staffordshire, Historical Guide (2009), p. 47. Kennedy had met Baldwin in 1962 at a Nobel Prize dinner and briefly in May 1963 at Hickory Hill. They agreed to meet again, with a group of cultural leaders assembled by Baldwin.Saucedo, The Fire Within (2004), pp. 90‚Äì91. Meeting According to Clarence Benjamin Jones, an advisor to Martin Luther King Jr. and participant in the eventual meeting, in May 1963, Attorney General Robert Kennedy asked novelist James Baldwin to organize a \\"quiet, off-the-record, unpublicized get- together of prominent Negroes\\" to discuss the state of race relations. The meeting took place at an apartment owned by the Kennedy family at 24 Central Park South in New York City.Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), p. 331.

Berry, director of the Chicago Urban League * Kenneth Clark, psychologist, activist, and founder of Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited * June Shagaloff, Education Director of the NAACP (attending in an \\"unofficial capacity\\") * Lorraine Hansberry, playwright best known for A Raisin in the Sun (1959) * Lena Horne, musician, actor and activist * Clarence Benjamin Jones, advisor to Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and civil rights lawyer * Jerome Smith, Freedom Rider associated with the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) * Rip Torn, a young white actor Jerome Smith was a young black civil rights worker who had been beaten and jailed in Mississippi. Edwin Berry brought him along, and his story was not known by Robert Kennedy or most of those in attendance., p. 22. As the meeting got underway and Robert Kennedy began to recount how the Justice Department had been supporting the civil rights movement, Jerome Smith suddenly began to weep \\"as if he'd just suffered some traumatic flashback\\" and said: \\"I've seen you guys [referring to the Justice Department] stand around and do nothing more than take notes while we're being beaten.\\" The mood quickly became tense. Jerome Smith, Baldwin later said,Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), pp. 331‚Äì332. > set the tone of the meeting because he stammers when he's upset and he > stammered when he talked to Bobby and said that he was nauseated by the > necessity of being in that room.

We were the > reasonable, responsible, mature representatives of the Black community. > Lorraine Hansberry said, \\"You've got a great many very, very accomplished > people in this room, Mr. Attorney General. But the only man who should be > listened to is that man over there.\\" Kennedy and Smith began to argue. Kennedy was particularly shocked when Smith said he would \\"never never never\\" join the military to fight against Cuba for the USA.Staffordshire, Historical Guide (2009), p. 48. The assembled group felt, generally, that Kennedy did not understand the depth of the problem at hand.Saucedo, The Fire Within (2004), pp. 92‚Äì93. In the 2017 documentary about Hansberry Sighted Eyes / Feeling HeartSighted Eyes / Feeling Heart documentary website which aired on the PBS series American Masters in 2018 Harry Belafonte recalled at this point Smith \\"bared his soul and all his pain and then said very aggressively 'Let me tell you something, in the midst of our oppression you expect to find us giddily going off to fight a war (i.e., Vietnam) that's your war, that's unjust, unfair, and so dishonorable it should shame you. I wouldn't pick up a gun to fight for this country. I'd die first.'\\" Author Lorraine Hansberry told Kennedy: \\"Look, if you can't understand what this young man is saying, then we are without any hope at all because you and your brother are representatives of the best that a White America can offer; and if you are insensitive to this, then there's no alternative except our going in the streets ... and chaos\\".Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), p. 332. According to historian Arthur Schlesinger, \\"she talked wildly about giving guns to Negroes in the street so they could start killing white people.\\" Jerome Smith told Kennedy: \\"I'm close to the moment where I'm ready to take up a gun.\\"Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), pp. 332-333.James Hilty, Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector (Temple University Press, 2000), p. 355.Tony Ortega \\"Miss Lorraine Hansberry & Bobby Kennedy\\" , Village Voice, May 4, 2009. Kennedy said that his family, immigrants from Ireland, suffered discrimination upon arriving in America but were able to overcome their hardships to achieve political success, and that the U.S. might have a black president in 40 years. David Baldwin observed that his family had been in the country far longer than Kennedy's, yet had barely been permitted to climb out of poverty.Saucedo, The Fire Within (2004), p. 93. Kennedy later said: \\"They seemed possessed. They reacted as a unit. It was impossible to make contact with any of them.\\" The meeting ended after two and a half or three hours, when Hansberry walked out and most of the others followed.Hilty (2000), Robert Kennedy: Brother Protector, p. 355-356. Though billed as off- the-record, details of the meeting were recounted a few weeks later in The New York Times in an article by James Reston about the Kennedy administration's approach to race relations. Reston's summary provides only Robert Kennedy's perspective on the meeting, offering his appraisal that the problem was one of both \\"militant Negro and white leaders\\" and stating that the attorney general \\"apparently has little faith in the quieter moderate leaders of both races.\\" As Clarence Jones served as the attorney representing Martin Luther King, Jr. at the meeting, he strongly disputed Reston's account of the meeting and issued a detailed, four-page letter to the editor of the New York Times, with copy to Robert Kennedy, providing his alternative assessment of the meeting. Directly challenging the perception given in Reston's coverage of the meeting, that \\"a lawyer for Dr. King had remained silent throughout the meeting (the implication being as a 'moderate' such a lawyer was intimidated from speaking),\\" Jones summarized four areas of discussion in which he had actively engaged with the Attorney General during the meeting. Specifically, Jones notes that he had requested that the President personally accompany University of Alabama students as a way to help assure successful integration. He directed the Attorney General's attention to the appointment of certain judges by his administration who, in Jones' opinion, \\"had openly and avowedly, prior to their appointment, indicated their flagrant segregationist views.\\" He raised the idea of the President making a series of televised speeches addressing the elimination of segregation and discrimination. Finally, he participated in the discussion of the role and effectiveness of some white Southern FBI agents in civil rights cases. Aftermath Despite feeling emotional and overwhelmed in the aftermath of the meeting, Baldwin and Clark arrived (half an hour late) to WGBH, where Clark interviewed Baldwin on tape.The Negro Protest; Boston, Beacon Press, 1963. \\"We were a little shocked at the extent of his naivete,\\" Baldwin was quoted as saying.Solet, Sue. \\"Negroes shocked by Robert Kennedy's 'naivete'.\\" Washington Post, May 25, 1963. Accessed via ProQuest. \\"We told him that though the Kennedy administration has done some things the Eisenhower administration never did, its actions have yet to affect the masses of Negro people.\\"Layhmond Robinson, \\"Robert Kennedy Fails to Sway Negroes at Secret Talks Here\\", New York Times, May 26, 1963; accessed via ProQuest, May 21, 2013. After the meeting, Robert Kennedy ordered FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to increase surveillance of Baldwin and tap the home phone of Jones.Talia Whyte, \\"Baldwin: A literary standard\\", Black History 43 (27), February 14, 2009. A memo issued four days after the meeting asked the FBI to produce information, \\"particularly of a derogatory nature.\\" A subsequent report labeled Baldwin both a \\"pervert\\" and a \\"communist.\\"James Campbell, \\"James Baldwin and the FBI\\", The Threepenny Review 77, Spring 1999; accessed via JStor. Actor Rip Torn discovered that he also had been placed under surveillance after the meeting.W. J. Weatherby, \\"Mr Baldwin and the spooks: Letter from America\\", The Guardian, September 20, 1988; accessed via ProQuest, May 21, 2013. Baldwin also says he suffered retaliation from the State Department, including interference with his passport. Harry Belafonte recalled Martin Luther King Jr. calling him the following day wanting to know the details of the meeting. When Belafonte described the \\"disaster,\\" and Jerome Smith's \\"fighting words,\\" King said \\"Maybe it's just what Bobby needed to hear.\\" Alex Rawls \\"A Cocktail Party in 1963\\" Offbeat Magazine, January 16, 2012 Jones recalled Martin Luther King Jr. saying shortly after the dust-up, \\"Looks like the Attorney General of the United States regards you as an uppity Negro. But that's all right. We still love you. You're our uppity Negro.\\" To his biographer, Arthur Schlesinger, Kennedy said (\\"his voice filled with despair\\"):Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), p. 334. > They don't know what the laws are‚Äîthey don't know what the facts are‚Äîthey > don't know what we've been doing or what we're trying to do. You can't talk > to them the way you can talk to Martin Luther King or Roy Wilkins. They > didn't want to talk that way. It was all emotion, hysteria‚Äîthey stood up and > orated‚Äîthey cursed‚Äîsome of them wept and left the room. Schlesinger and others nevertheless describe the moment as a long-term turning point in RFK's attitude towards the Black liberation struggle.Goduti, Robert F. Kennedy and the Shaping of Civil Rights (2013), p. 192.Schlesinger, Robert Kennedy and His Times (1978), p. 335.Saucedo, The Fire Within (2004), pp. 94‚Äì95. Less than one month later, President Kennedy gave his landmark Civil Rights Address. Robert Kennedy was the only White House adviser to actively encourage his brother to give the speech, in which the president publicly proposed legislation that would become the Civil Rights Act of 1964.Robert Schlesinger, \\"The Story Behind JFK's 1963 Civil Rights Speech\\", US News and World Report, June 11, 2013. Revisiting the issue of military service, Robert Kennedy later asked the Senate Judiciary Committee: \\"How long can we say to a Negro in Jackson, 'When war comes you will be an American citizen, but in the meantime you're a citizen of Mississippi‚Äîand we can't help you'?\\"*Edwin O.

Background CL North did some electrical work for Dunrae Manufacturing. Unfortunately, for reasons not explained in the judgement, the final bill exceeded the original estimate for the work subsequently done, resulting in Dunrae receiving 4 invoices from CL North totalling $14,049.93. Dunrae paid the first two invoices, and disputed the remaining balance. A few months later, Dunrae mailed CL North a cheque for $6,158.98, with an attached (brief and unsigned) note stating ‚ÄúEnclosed cheque is tendered in full and final payment of our account with you, accordingly our account is now clear‚Äù, for which CL North later banked. However, the Office Manager did not make any note of the attached letter, nor brought it to the attention of the management. The management stated in these proceedings that if this note had been brought to their attention, they would not have banked the cheque. CL North then proceeded to continue invoicing Dunrae for the balance, for which they pleaded that there was no balance owing due to accord and satisfaction, a legal issue that the creditor could simply deny as they claimed that they had not even received the letter in the first place. CL North then sued for the remaining balance of $2,591.45, and just before trial, the Office Manager then admitted they probably received the letter as claimed. Despite this setback, the creditor pursued its legal claim on the grounds that there was no legally binding agreement, and won judgement against the debtor in the District Court. The debtor appealed. Held The judge overturned the District court‚Äôs ruling, meaning the remaining balance was not legally owed any more. Smellie J stated: However, the judgement did not cover what would have happened if the creditor here had banked the cheque and promptly informed the debtor that it was not accepted has full satisfaction, as per Haines House Haulage Co Ltd v Gamble, or if banked by mistake, that it had immediately notified the debtor that it had been banked by mistake, and not accepted it as full satisfaction, as per Magnum v Viko.

The goal was to collect 15 million signatures by 30 June 2013, the one-year anniversary of Morsi's inauguration. On 29 June 2013 the movement claimed to have collected more than 22 million signatures (22,134,460). That figure was not verified by independent sources with skepticism over the rise in number by millions in a matter of days, with the Freedom and Justice Party putting the figure at 170,000 signatures. A counter campaign was launched in support of Morsi's presidency which claimed to have collected 11 million signatures.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/27/tamarod-egypt-morsi- campaign-oppsition-resignation The movement was planning to become a political party following the 2014 Egyptian presidential election. The movement helped launch the June 2013 Egyptian protests which preceded the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat. History The Rebel movement was founded by five activists, including its official spokesman Mahmoud Badr,Hussein, Dina. Tamarod: The Organization of a Rebellion. Middle East Institute. Retrieved on 7 July 2013. on 28 April 2013. An opposition group within the organization -- initially named Tamarod 2 Get Liberated -- argued that Tamarod was only able to collect 8.5 million signatures and that some of its founders were trained by security services. A report by Reuters alleged that police officers and officials from the Ministry of the Interior signed and helped distribute and collect signatures for the petition, as well as attending demonstrations themselves. Members of the movement stated that they would support appointing Maher el- Beheiry, the former head of the Supreme Constitutional Court, to temporarily replace Morsi if he were to step down. The movement gave Morsi until 2 July 2013 to step down; if he did not step down, a civil disobedience campaign was to be initiated. On 2 July 2013, the Salafist Call and its political wing, the Salafist Nour Party, stated that it had three main demands: a snap presidential poll should take place, a technocratic government should be formed and a committee should be formed to examine constitutional amendments. The Egyptian armed forces gave both sides until 3 July 2013 to defuse the crisis. At that point, the armed forces said it would offer a \\"road map\\", though they stated that they would not get involved in politics or the government. Subsequently, the armed forces removed Morsi and replaced him with Adly Mahmoud Mansour, who had recently succeeded Maher el-Beheiry as head of the Supreme Constitutional Court. Supporters of Tamarod Among the political forces that initially announced support for the Rebel movement were Shayfeencom, the Kefaya Movement, the National Salvation Front and the April 6 Youth Movement. Nabil Na'eem, a former leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, stated that he would take part in the protests. The Strong Egypt Party stated that it supported the movement and called for early presidential elections. The movement also accepted an endorsement by Ahmed Shafik. Mohamed El Baradei, one of the leaders of the National Salvation Front, stated that former members of the National Democratic Party would be welcomed as long as they were not convicted of any crimes. Opposition to Tamarod Supporters of President Morsi from the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist organizations launched two campaigns called Mu'ayyed (supporter) and Tagarrod (impartiality) in response to the Rebel movement petitions and started collecting signatures to support the continuation of Morsi's rule. The Tagarrod campaign stated that it had 11 million signatures by 20 June 2013. Some Morsi supporters criticised the Rebel movement by claiming that it is \\"a manipulation of the will of the people and only serves counter-revolutionary forces supported by the remnants of the Mubarak regime\\". Role following the military coup The Tamarod campaign strongly supported the military's toppling of Morsi, the military transition government, the security force raids that involved the killing of hundreds of Brotherhood members and the jailing of thousands of rank and file. Mahmoud Badr and another Tamarod founder, Mohamed Abdel Aziz, were appointed to the post-coup fifty-member committee redrafting Egypt's Constitution. In the aftermath of the military coup in Egypt, defence minister General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi called for mass demonstrations on 26 July 2013, to grant his forces a \\"mandate\\" to crack down on \\"terrorism\\". While this announcement was rejected by Egyptian human rights groups and by many of the political movements that had initially supported the military coup, such as the revolutionary April 6 Youth Movement and the moderate Strong Egypt Party, Tamarod sided with General Sisi and called on their supporters to participate in the demonstrations. Mohamed Khamis, a leading Tamarod activist, said: \\"We support it, we will go out on the streets on Friday, and ask the army and the police to go and end this terrorism.\\" On 14 August 2013, following the August 2013 Rabaa massacre by security forces of supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi, in which hundreds of protesters were killed, Tamarod criticized Vice-President Mohamed ElBaradei for his decision to resign in protest against the crackdown. On 15 August, Tamarod released a statement on state television calling on all Egyptians to form neighbourhood watches, in anticipation of plans by supporters of former president Mohamed Morsi to organise nationwide marches in protest against the violent dispersal of their sit-ins. Founder and spokesperson Mahmoud Badr said: \\"Just as you met our calls to take to the streets on 30 June, today we ask you to meet our calls and form neighbourhood watches tomorrow. Our country is facing huge threats.\\" While this call was supported by the National Salvation Front, it was rejected by the Strong Egypt Party and by the April 6 Youth Movement, which called it irresponsible and warned that it could lead towards civil war. Tamarod's indiscriminate support for the Egyptian military has been criticised by some liberal activists and media, with Mada Masr's Sarah Carr calling them the \\"Tamarod (Rebel) battalion of the Egyptian army\\". Tamarod has also supported the police. On 8 October 2013, the group announced that it would run in the 2015 parliamentary election. Tamarod formed and tried to officially register a political party called the Arabic Popular Movement. In early 2014, some leaders of the movement broke away and formed a splinter group, known as Tamarud 2 Get Liberated, in response to the authoritarianism of the post-coup military backed government. Members of the breakaway faction have claimed that some of the founders of the Tamarod movement were agents of state security forces. The organization, named Taharor, has stated that it believes that the Tamarod movement ignores police brutality. The group was critical of the April 6 Youth Movement following the banning of the youth movement; Tamarod spokesman Mohamed Nabawy stated that the ruling of the Egyptian judiciary was based on \\"evidence\\". Campaign against the US Tamarod Facebook cover photo Following efforts by the US administration to mediate reconciliation between the post-coup government and the Muslim Brotherhood and Western criticism of the violent dispersal of sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Morsi, Tamarod sharply criticised the United States and President Obama. In an interview, Tamarod co-founder Mahmoud Badr said: \\"I tell you, President Obama, why don't you and your small, meaningless aid go to hell?\\" Tamarod launched a campaign to refuse US aid in all its forms and to cancel the peace agreement \\"between Egypt and the Israeli entity\\" and called for rallies in support of the Egyptian government against \\"foreign intervention.\\" In August 2013, Tamarod expressed its anti-US attitude by choosing the picture of a burning American flag as cover photo of its Facebook page. Support for the Syrian government In August 2013, when several Western countries were discussing military strikes against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad following an alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta region on 21 August, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of civilians, Tamarod released a statement saying that \\"it is a national duty to support the Syrian army\\" and denounced \\"people who betray their country\\". In the statement, Tamarod also called on the Egyptian government to close the Suez Canal to any vessel supporting military action against Syria.

He made two Olympic finals at 800 meters and once tied the world record at 880 yards. Career As a sophomore at Indiana University, Hornbostel won the 800 meters at the 1932 NCAA Championships in a meeting record time of 1:52.7. As the NCAA Championships were simultaneously an early Olympic tryout meet, he qualified for the Olympic Trials in Stanford, where he placed second behind Edwin Genung and qualified for the team. At the Olympics in Los Angeles Hornbostel won his heat, running 1:52.4 and beating the eventual silver medalist, Alex Wilson of Canada. In the final he placed sixth, again running 1:52.7. Hornbostel repeated as NCAA champion in 1933, beating mile champion Glenn Cunningham by inches as both clocked 1:50.9 for 880 yards. This equalled Ben Eastman's world record from the previous year. Two weeks later Cunningham beat Hornbostel at the national championships in 1:51.8 (800 m). Hornbostel won the NCAA championship for a third and final time in 1934, this time in 1:51.9 (880 yards). At the Princeton Invitational, however, he was decisively beaten by Eastman, who ran 1:49.8 to break his own and Hornbostel's record. Hornbostel was some five yards behind in 1:50.7, also under the old record. Hornbostel qualified for the Olympics again in 1936, placing second to eventual gold medalist John Woodruff at the Trials in 1:51.3. In the slow and tactical Olympic final Hornbostel finished fifth.

It is a development of email marketing that aims to re-attract website viewers or customers. In other words, the whole idea of email remarketing is attracting customers or users back for purchase, growing repeated customers. Types of email remarketing Email remarketing can be done through various kinds of emails, such as:  Browse Abandonment Emails  Browse abandonment emails reconnect merchants with website visitors who quit the site without purchase action, giving chances to turn window shoppers into actual buyers. Browse abandonment is on the upper side of the purchase funnel, and the next abandonment which stop customers accessing to check-out is cart abandonment. Instead of contacting everyone, marketers are more likely to send email to the people who have shown obvious interest on the products. For example, they are the ones who browse key pages of the website or who begin a process such as registering an account or downloading a white paper but then stop the action, without purchase any products or services. Usually, browse abandonment emails are edited based on the receivers' browse and search history. In this case, the emails would be personalized, more targeted on individuals, compared to marketing emails. Browse recovery emails could make approximately 36.63% revenue and rise 2.79% sales effectively. Cart Abandonment Emails As mentioned, cart abandonment is the second prevention. Cart abandonment emails are worked as a reminder of what items the receivers have abandoned. They are sent to customers who have added products to their shopping cart but failed to check-out. In order to prevent shopping cart abandonment, marketers would send remarketing email to customers. According to the research by Experian Marketing Services, simply sending an abandoned cart reminder increases purchase rate by 1.53% and open rates by 41%. Compared to the promotion and advertising emails, uncompleted order reminder increases purchase rate at 19 times higher. Some people are worried that sending cart abandonment emails will annoy people, and while that make be the case, research shows that 69% of people found the 'reminders' to be helpful in some way. Traditional cart abandonment emails require the advertiser to have contact information already in place to send the email. This requires that website visitors that abandon their carts must have previously subscribed, purchased, or otherwise provided their contact information. Newer technologies allow marketers to first identify anonymous website visitors using a cookie-based identification system, and then to follow-up with those visitors directly via email to convert them.  Retargeting Anonymous Website Bounces  When individuals visit a website without converting there are tools available to identify anonymous website visitors, match them with their email address and follow-up directly to convert. Similar to cart abandonment, this type of email remarketing is done prior to the cart - with follow-up sent even if the visitor hasn't provided their contact information.  Post-Purchase Emails  After completing orders, merchants would send a review emails to consumers. Some of those emails are telling them what they have bought before, some are post-purchase survey, etc. Before consumers make purchase decisions, they are heavily rely on the customer reviews about the products. Here is an example. Sephora, a leading beauty retailer, thanks the customer for their recent purchase while simultaneously asking them to review their new products. Within the email they also give the shopper an additional reason to engage by promoting other content resources including Sephora TV and beauty news. This review campaign appears to be extremely successful. In addition, in the first quarter of 2015, the read rate for these campaigns was 58% higher than their average read rate and the deleted unread percentage was 44% lower. To sum up, post-purchase emails could not only help the companies to strength the brand identity, re-engage the existed customers, but also help attract new customers with advertisements and promotion. Order follow ups, rewards or loyalty programs, inactive customer follow ups, and so forth...  Comparison to email marketing  Email marketing is more similar to newsletter which is broad and impersonal, like sending a direct email to existing customers or potential customers. On this stage, marketers may have little information about the receivers. The purpose of Marketing email is solely to deliver promotional messages. Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages. On the other hand, remarking emails should be much more personalized. As vendors probably have collected information about the customers on the first stage that the customers exposed, they are taking the information they already have and using them to send relevant emails. For instance, when a customer bought an item at his first visit, vendors would probably ask him to complete a form about his contact information. Afterwards, marketers would use those contact details to do their remarking campaigns. \\"Remarketing is so powerful because it allows marketers the opportunity to continue the conversation, that otherwise may have only been a 30-second decision on the part of the consumer,\\" said Jason Hobbs, founder and president of digital marketing company The Found Group. Furthermore, Forrester Research found that remarketing emails can generate nearly four times more revenue and 18 times greater net profits compared with marketing using simply untargeted mailings. Email marketing gives vendors a chance to promote their products at the beginning, but email remarking allows the company to continue the business but targeted at less customers. In conclusion, email marketing covers wider area of customer group, while email remarking methods are more targeted and effective.  How email remarketing works   Benefits  The principle of advertisement is basically to give a persuasive argument for a product then put it in front of the public. With the development of technology, it makes advertising much easier. The word 'easier' means convenience and lower cost. In the past time, marketers usually printed the promotion messages into brochures then delivered them to thousands of mailboxes. Nowadays, marketers just design and edit the content into emails, then send those emails to countless email addresses in one second automatically. With no shipping fees, time lag, and printing cost, companies definitely have decreased much of their advertising costs in the present decade. Lower cost leads to higher revenue sometimes. Moreover, the data displayed above proves that email remarketing are bringing vendors brand loyalty, financial return, and so on.  How it works  By definition of 'remarketing', it restricts the volume of customer group that the marketers could reach. However, instead of direct emails, email remarketing are reaching the customers whose purchase intent is highest. The remarketing email receivers are existed customers and potential customers who have shown attention and obvious interests on the products and services. In this case, a persuasive argument on the items could easily drive them to buy. When to send the remarketing emails is a substantial problem. Experian Marketing Services found that emails sent closer to the abandonment is more likely to make lifts in revenue. Generally, it can be as early as 30 minutes to 1 day. For the promotion and reactivation emails and the other emails, they are suggested to be sent at 2 p.m. on every Tuesday and Thursday. What to send should be given careful consideration as well. For cart abandonment emails, the items left in the shopping cart should be shown in the email directly, as it leads to highest rate of transactions. The continue bottom to check-out should be shown in the obvious position in the emails, as well as the option for the transaction tools, such as 'via PayPal' or 'Paid by MasterCard'. For the Thank You for Purchase email, it works better if it includes a discount information for the next purchase. Frequency is the key. Experian Marketing Services recommends that cart abandonment emails should be sent at least twice after the first attempt, because the survey shows 54% lift in revenues when the second reminder email sent.

Childhood  Wise was born at the family home in Woolston near Kingsbridge, Devon, the son of George Furlong Wise of Woolston and his wife, Jane (n√©e Dacres). His mother was the sister of Vice-Admiral James Richard Dacres (1749‚Äì1810) and also of Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Dacres (1761‚Äì1837), two connections which would serve him well in his future naval career. Indeed, the name James Richard Dacres appears several times in Wise's lifetime because his uncle James Richard Dacres had a son, also called James Richard Dacres (1788‚Äì1853) who served alongside Wise at various times.  Early career  Wise entered the navy on 7 February 1797 on the frigate under his uncle Richard Dacres, and served, for the most part, with him on the home station, the coast of France, and in the West Indies. On 1 May 1804 he was promoted to lieutenant of the at Jamaica. At that time his uncle Vice Admiral James Dacres was second in command on the Jamaica station, serving under Sir John Thomas Duckworth and flying his flag in the Franchise. Wise was a lieutenant on when she was caught in a hurricane off the West Indies in September 1804. His fellow lieutenant on Theseus Edward Burt (later Captain) drew a set of four prints which are in the National Maritime Museum. Wise was to later commission Thomas Luny recreate two of them as oil paintingsHeld in a private collection when they had both retired to Devon. Wise then spent a brief period on . On 1 November 1805 (confirmed on 22 February 1806) he was promoted to commander of the Drake. On 14 January 1806 he was transferred to , a sloop of war which was previously under the command of his cousin Commander James Richard Dacres On 5 May Elk, under Wise's command, captured a Spanish privateer rowboat armed with a swivel gun and small arms. The privateer was five days out of Santiago and had taken two doggers. Elk caught up with the privateer off Cape Cruz, Cuba, captured her and retook one of the doggers. The privateer was the Cubana, with a 14-man crew, only five of whom were still aboard. HMS Mediator On 18 May 1806 he was promoted to post-captain and appointed to the Mediator. On 16 February 1807 Wise in Mediator and James Richard Dacres in Bacchante led a raid on the fort at Samana. He was subsequently awarded a sword worth ¬£100 from Lloyd's Patriotic Fund, which bears the inscription \\"From the Patriotic Fund at Lloyd's to William Furlong Wise Esq. Capt. of H.M.S. Mediator for his Gallant Conduct in Storming and Destroying with the Seamen and Marines belonging to His Majesty's Ships Bacchante and Mediator the Fort and Cannon in the Harbour of Samana on 16th of February 1807 as Recorded in the London Gazette of the 25th of April\\" In July 1807 Wise was invalided out of Mediator, and spent some time in the West Indies recuperating.  Marriage  On 16 June 1810, he married Frances Grant Grenfell of England, the only daughter of William Grenfell. Fanny accompanied Wise on at least one voyage, as attested to by Captain Coggeshall of the Leo in his account of his capture and passage to Gibraltar as Wise's prisoner.  HMS Granicus - Bombardment of Algiers  Bombardment of Algiers by Luny. In November 1813 Wise commissioned the 36-gun frigate Granicus. On 2 December 1814 he captured the Leo, an American privateer of 6 guns and 76 men, near Cape Spartel On 27 August 1816 in Granicus he was with Admiral Lord Exmouth at the Bombardment of Algiers. He was cited for notable action. A contemporary wrote of the action: \\"The Granicus and Hebrus frigates, and the smaller vessels (except the bombs) being considered in the light of a corps-de- reserve, had not had any particular stations assigned to them, but were to bring up abreast of any openings they could find in the line of battle. Impelled onward by the ardent desire of filling the first of these openings, the Hebrus got becalmed by the heavy cannonade, and was obliged to anchor a little without the line, on the Queen Charlotte's larboard quarter. The Granicus, finding herself shooting fast ahead, hove to, with the intention of waiting until her companions had taken their stations. As, owing to the dense smoke which prevailed, nothing beyond the distance of a cable's length could be seen, except the Queen Charlotte's mast-head flag, Captain Wise allowed 10 minutes to elapse for the ships to anchor. The Granicus then filled, let fall her fore-sail, set top-gallant-sails, and, soon gaining fresh way, steered straight for a beacon that, phoenix-like, seemed to live in the hottest of the fire. With a display of intrepidity and of seamanship alike unsurpassed, Captain Wise anchored his frigate in a space scarcely exceeding her own length between the Queen Charlotte and Superb ; a station of which a three-decked line-of-battle ship might justly have been proud.\\" The Granicus, on this brilliant occasion, sustained a loss of 16 killed and 42 wounded; amongst the latter were Lieutenant Henry Augustus Perkins, and Messrs. Lewis Punbar Mitchell, Lewis Tobias Jones, George R. Glennie, and Dacres Furlong Wise, Midshipmen. The reference to Dacres Furlong Wise reminds us of the close links between Wise and Dacres family, he would likely have been the son of one of his uncles taken under Wise's wing as a midshipman on Granicus. On the second day after the battle, the following correspondence took place between Granicus crew and the Superbs: :\\"The ship's company of the little frigate that had the honour to lay between the Queen Charlotte and Superb, on the glorious 27th of August, 1816, beg leave to express their high admiration of the noble fire kept up by these ships on that glorious day, by which, in a great measure, the enemy's fire was drawn from his Majesty's ship Granicus.\\" Superb replied. :\\"The ship's company of the Superb returns their many thanks to the ship's company of the little frigate, for the high compliment they have been pleased to pay them, and have only to hope that should they ever again go into action, they may have a Granicus to support them.Marshall (1827), pp.150‚Äì151 Like many naval captains Wise commissioned Thomas Luny to do a painting of the bombardment for him. The paintings are all essentially similar to the one Luny did for Lord Exmouth that now hangs in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich, the main dereferences being each particular Captain's vessel is centre stage. On 21 September 1816, in recognition of Wise's contribution to the action at Algiers he was made a Companion of the Most Honorable Military Order of the Bath (CB).  HMS Spartan - return to Algiers  On 6 January 1818 Wise was appointed to the frigate , which he commanded on the home station and in the West Indies until 1821. The Spartan was despatched to Algiers where Wise entered into a negotiation with the Dey, the result of which was, the payment of 35,000 dollars as a compensation for the property plundered on board the Misericordia, and an unqualified disavowal, on the part of the reigning Dey, of the act of his predecessor (who died of the plague on 1 March 1818) in sending away the representative of his Sardinian Majesty. In 1819, Spartan visited Madeira, Dominica, Vera Cruz, Jamaica, Barbados, and Halifax. In July 1820, she conveyed Lord Combermere from Barbados to England; and we subsequently find her proceeding to the Havannah, Charlestown, and New York ; from whence she returned to England, for the purpose of being paid off, in January 1821.  Retirement & death  Spartan returned to England, for the purpose of being paid off, in January 1821, after which Wise retired to Plymouth. Wise was an active member of Plymouth civic society, becoming Mayor of Plymouth in 1829. In 1832 when Plymouth suffered an outbreak of cholera, Wise was presented with a silver salver by Benjamin Smith III of London and inscribed \\"To William Furlong Wise Esq. Captain RN.CB. In testimony of his generous and unremitting exertions, regardless of all personal hazard, in behalf of the necessitous and afflicted, during the prevalence of Malignant Cholera in Plymouth 1832, Presented and inscribed by his fellow townsmen.\\"In a private collection. On 23 November 1841 Wise was appointed Rear-Admiral. Wise died on 29 April 1844 at his residence, Hoegate House, Plymouth, after a week's illness. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * (rev.

They form the largest racial group in Haiti and together with other Afro-Caribbean groups, the largest racial group in the region. The majority of Afro-Haitians are descendants of enslaved Africans brought to the island by the Spanish Empire and the Kingdom of France to work on plantations. Since the Haitian revolution, Afro-Haitians have been the largest racial group in the country, accounting for 95% of the population in the early 21st century . The remaining 5% of the population is made up of mixed persons (mixed African and European descent) and other minor groups (Europeans, Arabs and Asians descent).  Origins  The African people of Haiti derived from various areas, spanning from Senegal to the Congo. Most of which were brought from West Africa, with a considerable number also brought from Central Africa. Some of these groups include those from the former Kongo kingdom (Kongo), (Igbo Benin (Ewe and Yoruba) and Togo land. Others in Haiti were brought from Senegal,Hall, Catherine, Review of The Birth of the Modern World 1780‚Äì1914: Global Connections and Comparisons, by Christopher Bayly online at history.ac.uk, accessed 7 August 2008 Guinea (imported by the Spanish since the sixteenth century and then by the French), Sierra Leone, Windward Coast, Angola, Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, and Southeast Africa (such as the Bara tribesmen of Madagascar, who were brought to Haiti in the eighteenth century).  Demography  Although Haiti averages approximately 250 people per square kilometre (650 per sq mi.), its population is concentrated most heavily in urban areas, coastal plains, and valleys. Haiti's population was about 9.8 million according to UN 2008 estimates, with half of the population being under 20 years old. The first formal census, taken in 1950, showed a population of 3.1 million. According to The World Factbook, 95% of Haitians are primarily of African descent; the remaining 5% of the population are mostly of mixed-race and European background, and a number of other ethnicities.  Culture  Kanaval in Jacmel Haiti 2014 34Culture, religion and social organization are the result in Haiti of a process of syncretism between French and African traditions, mainly Dahomey-Nigerian. A small minority cultural practice in Haiti is Haitian Vodou. This probably originated in Benin, although there are strong elements added from the Congo of Central Africa and many African nations are represented in the liturgy of S√®vis Lwa. A generally ignored but significant element is that of the Taino people, the indigenous people of Hispaniola. The Tainos were influential in the belief system of Haitian Vodou, especially in the Petro cult, a religious group with no counterpart on the African continent. Characterized by the worship of the loa, the sect has influences from Native American folklore zemis. The entire northern area of Haiti is influenced by the practices of the Congo. In the north, these are often called Rites Congo or Lemba. In the south, the Congo influence is called Petwo (Petro). Many loa are of Congolese origin, such as Basimbi and Lemba. Polygyny persists alongside Catholic marriages. The dances and some forms of recreation tie in with African activities. The preparation of beans is done in the style of Western Africa. Popular literature retains fables and other forms that are expressed in the vernacular. Economic activities are typical of Western culture and clothing tends to be European, but the scarf worn by women over the head is typical of clothing worn throughout West Africa. Two languages are spoken in Haiti. French is taught in schools and known by about 42% of the population, but spoken by a minority of black and biracial residents, in Port-au-Prince and other cities. Haitian Creole, with roots in French, Spanish, Taino. Portuguese, English and African languages, is a language with dialectal forms in different regions. It is spoken throughout the country, but is used extensively in rural areas.Michel DeGraff, \\"Language Barrier in Haiti,\\" The Boston Globe, June 16, 2010 The music of Haiti is heavily influenced by the rhythms which came from Africa with the slaves. Two of these rhythms come directly from the harbour and the Congo; a third rhythm, the \\"petro\\", developed on the island during the colonial era. All are part of the rhythms used in Vodou ceremonies. These rhythms have created a musical style, rasin, where percussion is the most important musical instrument, and despite being closely related to religion has become a popular kind of folk music. Another type of music, which arises spontaneously from people with hand-held instruments, is twoubadou, a musical style that has endured to this day. Currently the music heard in Haiti's Compas genre is a little softer than the merengue, and combines Congo rhythms with European and Caribbean influences. Kompa is the most current version of this rhythm.

The merger of two of Geelong's oldest clubs was because Newtown had difficulty getting players so they looked to their neighboring club, Chilwell. The club also has a historical link to the Barwon Football Club, which at its peak in the mid-1870s was one of the strongest clubs in Victoria, before it merged into Chilwell in 1879. When the league was formed in 1979 the Eagles were one of the 10 clubs that broke away from the Geelong & District Football League.

It was completed in 1684 for protection against the constant threat of pirates. The fortress was ransacked several times before Venezuela gained independence from Spain. Today the castle has been restored and serves as a museum. History Pampatar, or Port Royal Mampatare, was founded in 1536 on the shore of the best protected deep water anchorage on the island. The city was divided into two parts due to the irregular coastline. The original castle was built over a period of about 20 years, started in 1622. It was sited in the heart of the old city, looking out over the Bay of Pampatar. Its purpose, together with the La Caranta fort on the other side of the bay, was to protect the town from pirates with crossfire. The fort was destroyed by Dutch pirates in 1662 when they burned Pampatar. In 1664 Captain Carlos Navarro began the reconstruction of the castle after a design by military engineer Juan Bet√≠n. In 1676 Juan Mu√±oz Gadea was appointed Governor of Margarita. When he reached the island in August 1677 he found that it had been devastated earlier in the year by a privateering raid by the French Marquis de Maintenon. Gadea focused all available resources, including some of his own funds, on completing and manning Fort San Carlos. The work was eventually completed in 1684. In subsequent years the castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times. La Caranta was destroyed by pirates in 1626. The ruins remain. During the Venezuelan War of Independence the revolutionary Luisa C√°ceres de Arismendi was held in the castle in 1816 while being moved from the Castillo de Santa Rosa in La Asunci√≥n to the prison in La Guaira on the mainland. She is considered the heroine of the war of independence, and her remains are now in the National Pantheon of Venezuela. On 3 November 1816 the Spanish were forced to evacuate Isla Margarita. After boarding all the soldiers and supplies, they left a lighted fuse leading to a pile of gunpowder that would have destroyed the castle. A revolutionary soldier noticed the fuse by accident and extinguished it before any damage was done. The next year the Spanish under General Pablo Morillo returned to the island and made the fort their headquarters during a campaign to regain control. However, after six weeks in which the islanders reverted to guerrilla warfare the Spanish returned to the mainland. Structure Layout of the fortress The castle is a classical example of contemporary military architecture, typical of fortifications built along the coast of Venezuela during that period. The fort has thick stone walls. The square structure has four observation towers, one at each corner. The base is star-shaped. The coastal battery consisted of a dozen cannon pointing across the bay. There is a moat around the fort, but it was never practical to fill it with water. Today San Carlos de Borromeo Castle has been renovated and is now a museum. Many of the fort's rooms were made into exhibition areas. The restoration was completed in 1968. The museum includes paintings of heroes of the War of Independence, and of events in the war. One commemorates the Battle of Matasiete, and is the most popular item in the collection. In this battle, fought on 31 July 1817, revolutionary forces under General Francisco Esteban G√≥mez defeated Spanish Royalist forces under the command of General Morillo outside La Asunci√≥n, a few miles to the northwest. There are also old weapons and a replica of Christopher Columbus's boat, the Santa Mar√≠a. The museum also has a collection of memorabilia of Luisa Caceres de Arismendi.

The association was established rather late in the struggle for women's suffrage (the Catholic Women's Suffrage Society was formed in the UK in 1911), despite the fact that most of Ireland's population was Catholic. Many also considered it risky to start a suffrage association with the potential of war looming over Ireland. Its founder members included Mary Hayden, a professor of modern Irish history at the University of Dublin and the first female to serve in the senate of the National University of Ireland (1909-1924), and Mrs. Gwynn (wife of Stephen Gwynn) who was the Honorary Secretary of the association. The association was non-party, non-militant, and was established to \\"organise Catholic women to fight for suffrage,\\" educate public opinion, bring Catholic women to realise the need for the female vote, and do the \\"common good in the name of Catholicism\\". Meetings When the ICWSA was established, they operated from an office at 15 Ely Place in Dublin, Ireland. Their first meeting was on March 29, 1915 and all following meetings were held every two weeks. The ICWSA began with 60 members, all women, and their numbers steadily increased. In their first meeting, Mrs. Gleeson, an involved member, designed a badge for the group which featured a Celtic symbol in green, blue, and white. Members wore these badges at meetings and at public events. During their meetings, members supplied the afternoon tea which they drink while reading articles \\"concerning women‚Äôs interests\\". During their meetings Hon. Secretary Mrs. Gwynn and Mrs. Mary Hayden gave speeches on what they had accomplished and what they planned to do in the future. The members of the ICWSA also paired up with other suffrage groups to protest or petition the government. Suffrage, temperance, and women‚Äôs rights efforts In April 1915 the ICWSA paired up with other suffrage groups to petition the sale of alcohol in Ireland. They wanted the government to place limits on how much alcohol you could purchase. In October, the ICWSA held a public meeting in the Mansion House and gave a lecture on ‚ÄúWomen teachers and the Vote‚Äù. Later that year, in November, they petitioned to the English and Irish prime minister to ‚Äúdemand inclusion of women‚Äù in certain bills and give them the right to vote. In December a member, Mrs. Cantwell, held a meeting at her home, where members could bring a friend or guest to participate or observe. Many of the visitors ended up joining the association. Early in 1916 the ICWSA petitioned the Home Office for the return of a female factory inspector to Ireland. The inspector was the only female inspector in Ireland and had been moved to England. The ICWSA claimed that they wanted her to return in order to ‚Äúsafeguard the rights of Irish factory girls‚Äù. Their petition was unsuccessful. That year they also printed two pamphlets called ‚ÄúThe Irish Citizen‚Äù and ‚ÄúAn American Priest on Votes for Women‚Äù which they handed out at polling booths during the election in Dublin. These pamphlets discussed why Irish women Should be able to vote. End of the ICWSA The ICWSA disbanded between 1916 and 1918 due to women getting the right to vote and the possibility of war (The Irish War of Independence). ‚ÄúLooking back over the past year we are greatly encouraged by what has been accomplished. Looking forward we see far more to be done for when this calamitous war is over we must be prepared for our responsibility and claim our right to help in reconstructing dislocated social conditions.‚Äù - Hon.

It is currently chaired by Lord Deben.  History  APFA formed in 1999 as the Association of Independent Financial Advisers or AIFA. They formed under the basis from a proposal that there would be a single trade association to represent independent financial advisers. Lord Hunt of Wirral was at the chair of the body until his resignation in 2002. He was replaced in 2003 by John Gummer MP, who was awarded a peerage in the 2010 Dissolution Honours List. In November 2012, the association changed its name from Association of Independent Financial Advisers to Association of Professional Financial Advisers. The change was ratified following a vote at the organisation‚Äôs annual general meeting, and meant that APFA from then on would represent financial advisers who are independent or restricted. The decision was taken so it would enable APFA to continue representing members affected by the rule changes in the Retail Distribution Review.  Structure  APFA has a membership of financial advisers for whom they represent. Members are also invited to join the APFA Council. The APFA Council discusses policy issues and acts as a platform of discussion between the organisation and its membership. In 2003 the Association of Mortgage Intermediaries or AMI was formed as a subsidiary company of the then AIFA. There was a subsequent split in 2012 whereby they both became individual entities.  Function  The Association of Professional Financial Advisers specialises in the financial services sector. It represents the collective interests of its membership.

Career  Melchiorri's first job in the hospitality industry was at the Embassy Suites as a Night Auditor in Overland Park, KS. Anthony MelchiorriTen months later, he became a night manager at the city's Plaza Hotel. Over the next four years, he worked his way up to the position of Director of Front Office Operations. After an 11-year-old girl came into the Plaza and asked him, \\"Mister, where's Eloise?,\\" he and Randee Glick created the hotel's Eloise tour. He was then appointed general manager of the Lucerne Hotel on the Upper West Side of New York City. Under his direction, the Lucerne was selected as the New York Times Travel Guide's Best Service Hotel. In 2005 he left the Lucerne to assume the position of general manager of New York's historic Algonquin Hotel. After convincing the owners to close the Algonquin for 29 days, he oversaw a $15 million roof-to-basement renovation of the building and its image, restoring it to the glory days of the famous Algonquin Round Table. He updated the rooms, repositioned the restaurants, and earned the hotel a high rating as a Michelin Guide Hotel. He orchestrated publicity campaigns such as the Algonquin's \\"$10,000 Martini\\", won a Hospitality Sales & Marketing Association International \\"Best of Show Award\\", and generally promoted the renovated hotel. Melchiorri also helped manage the Nickelodeon Hotel and Resort. He then became first vice president of Tishman Hotels, and later senior vice president of New York Hotel Management Company.

Koch (born 23 May 1953) is a German theoretical physicist. He is professor at the University of Marburg and works on condensed-matter theory, many-body effects, and laser theory. He is best known for his seminal contributions to the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors, semiconductor quantum optics, and semiconductor laser designs. Major portion of his research work has focused on the quantum physics and application potential of semiconductor nanostructures. Besides gaining fundamental insights to the many-body quantum theory, his work has provided new possibilities to develop, e.g., laser technology, based on accurate computer simulations. His objective has been to self-consistently include all relevant many-body effects in order to eliminate phenomenological approximations that compromise predictability of effects and quantum-device designs. Biography Stephan W. Koch studied physics at the University of Frankfurt, obtained his doctorate 1979 about the theory of electron‚Äìhole droplet nucleation in strongly excited semiconductorsKoch, S. W. (1979). Zur Theorie der Elektron- Loch-Tropfennukleation in stark angeregten Halbleitern (PhD). Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main (Germany). under the supervision of Prof. Hartmut Haug. During 1981‚Äì83, he was a postdoctoral fellow and visiting scientist at the IBM Research, San Jose/California and received habilitation in 1983 about the dynamics of equilibrium and non-equilibrium first-order phase transitions,Koch, S. W. (1983). Zur Dynamik von Gleichgewichts- und Nichtgleichgewichtsphasen√ºberg√§ngen erster Ordnung (Habilitation Thesis). Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt am Main (Germany). from the Department of Theoretical Physics of the University of Frankfurt. He continued his active research both in Germany and USA with the help of scholarships from the F. Thyssen Foundation and of the Heisenberg Program of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. In 1986, he became professor at the Physics Department and Optical Sciences Center of the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ, and in 1989, he accepted a chair there. In 1993, he accepted a chair of theoretical physics at the University of Marburg, where he has worked ever since. Stephan W. Koch has very close ties with the research efforts at the Optical Sciences Center, University of Arizona, where he has been an adjunct professor and an active collaborator since 1994. Main research topics Stephan W. Koch has worked on multiple topics in the general field of semiconductor optics. Before the year 1988, the state-of-the-art description of semiconductor optics and lasers was mainly based on simplified rate-equation approaches which cannot describe the nonequilibrium quantum kinetics of Coulomb-coupled electrons and holes (electronic vacancies in valence band). To go beyond this approach, he was one of the key players to develop the semiconductor Bloch equations (abbreviated as SBEs). Lindberg, M.; Koch, S. W. (1988). \\"Effective Bloch equations for semiconductors\\". Physical Review B 38 (5): 3342‚Äì3350. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.38.3342 Haug, H.; Koch, S. W. (2009). Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors (5th ed.). World Scientific. p. 216. Ever since this breakthrough, the SBEs have been expanded to systematically include new many-body effects such as excitation-induced dephasing, Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). Semiconductor Quantum Optics. Cambridge University Press. Wang, H.; Ferrio, K.; Steel, D.; Hu, Y.; Binder, R.; Koch, S. W. (1993). \\"Transient nonlinear optical response from excitation induced dephasing in GaAs\\".

Nature Materials 5 (7): 523‚Äì531. doi:10.1038/nmat1658 The SBEs research is still very active, and the SBEs are the most sophisticated and successful approach to describe optical properties of semiconductors originating from the classical light‚Äìmatter interaction. During the late 1980s, quantum-dot systems started to catch a significant research attention worldwide due to their intriguing quantum-confinement properties. He and his coworkers demonstrated Hu, Y.; Lindberg, M.; Koch, S. (1990). \\"Theory of optically excited intrinsic semiconductor quantum dots\\". Physical Review B 42 (3): 1713‚Äì1723. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.42.1713 the configuration-interaction approach and its application to the optical properties of strongly quantum-confined semiconductors. This approach is actively used in order to explain the quantum-optical properties of quantum-dot systems. Several of his ongoing projects focus on problems arising in the area of modern semiconductor quantum optics, microcavities, and laser theory.Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. M.; Kira, M.; Koch, S. W.; Scherer, A. (2006). \\"Vacuum Rabi splitting in semiconductors\\". Nature Physics 2 (2): 81‚Äì90. doi:10.1038/nphys227 In this field, Stephan W. Koch and his coworkers have concentrated on explaining how the quantum features of light can be described in connection with semiconductors. The novelty and difficulty of this research stems from determining and controlling many-body and quantum-optical features simultaneously. The first step toward this direction emerged in the form of the semiconductor luminescence equations Kira, M.; Jahnke, F.; Koch, S.; Berger, J.; Wick, D.; Nelson, T.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H. (1997). \\"Quantum Theory of Nonlinear Semiconductor Microcavity Luminescence Explaining ‚ÄúBoser‚Äù Experiments\\". Physical Review Letters 79 (25): 5170‚Äì5173. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.79.5170 (abbreviated as SLEs); the SLEs describe the quantum physics where quantum fluctuations of light initiate incoherent light emission from spontaneous recombination of Coulomb-coupled electron‚Äìhole pairs. The SLEs not only set the standard in describing quantum- light emission in semiconductors but they are also ideally suited for modeling quantum-light sources and filters based on semiconductor technology. The extensions of SLEs include resonance fluorescence and higher-order photon- correlation effects and are the basis to expand the quantum-optical spectroscopy. He and his coworkers are working on a systematic theory to describe excitation of solids with THz fields. Typical laser excitations are resonant with band-to-band transitions, not the energy difference of several relevant many-body states that actually match the THz-photon energy. Therefore, THz spectroscopy offers a new way to view many-body systems, e.g., by detecting particular many-body states Kira, M.; Hoyer, W.; Stroucken, T.; Koch, S. (2001). \\"Exciton Formation in Semiconductors and the Influence of a Photonic Environment\\". Physical Review Letters 87 (17). doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.87.176401. directly or by controlling their quantum dynamics. This research direction seems currently particularly lucrative due to the rapid progress of THz technology in producing high-quality, intense and/or single-cycle THz sources and lasers for spectroscopic purposes. Stephan W. Koch's innovations have always caught broad interest within the research community; his papers have been cited more than 15000 times to date (2013). Awards Stephan W. Koch has received numerous awards for his achievements in the field of semiconductor optics. Most notably due to his work on the theoretical foundations of light‚Äìmatter interaction in semiconductor materials, he received the Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in 1997 and the Max Planck Research Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and of the Max Planck Society in 1999.

He meets the woman of his dreams and a Hollywood photographer, who show him the good life of Los Angeles. The \\"dream girl\\" convinces him to follow his dreams and open his own garage with an inheritance from his father.

He is a great mechanic, but, because he lacks business acumen, he ends up doing all the hard work at the garage. He is left high and dry as the business goes belly up, the manager skips town, and his girlfriend has a new beau, thereby throwing him out on the street, just as a California earthquake strikes. Turns out, it is all a dream/nightmare, and the mechanic has second thoughts about going to California after all, but is convinced by his bowling buddy to give it a shot.

Career Early works Lee Kyung-hee began her television drama writing career penning star vehicles, among them Model (1997) with Kim Nam-joo and Jang Dong-gun, Kkokji (also known as Tough Guy's Love, 2000) with Won Bin, Lee Jong-won and Jo Min-ki, and Purity (also known as Pure Heart, 2001) with Ryu Jin and Lee Yo-won. But she made a name for herself with comedy-drama Sang Doo! Let's Go to School in 2003. About a young father who becomes a gigolo to pay for his daughter's medical bills, then goes back to finish high school with his first love as his teacher, it marked the successful acting debut of singer Rain. Industry insiders were surprised and impressed with the singer- turned-actor for handling the myriad emotions of his character with range, thanks to Lee who took advantage of Rain's screen presence and charisma, and wrapped the character's evolution around his strengths, trying to minimize his lack of experience. Co-stars Gong Hyo-jin, Lee Dong-gun, and Hong Soo-hyun, as well as director Lee Hyung-min were also praised for their work. Lee wrote another drama that same year, Breathless (also known as Running After a Dream or I Run), which was directed by Park Sung-soo (who previously helmed Ruler of Your Own World) and starred Kim Kang-woo and Chae Jung-an. It didn't have the popularity of Sang Doo, but gave an interesting, more mature spin to the \\"class divide\\" issue in its story about a factory worker entering into a relationship with a middle-class journalist. Through it, Lee proved that she could help rewrite the rules of the most predictable and clich√©d genre on TV. Her follow-up was a single episode on anthology series Drama City titled My Older Brother, starring Lee Min-ki as the young immature father of an eight- year-old boy. Mainstream success A year later, Lee Kyung-hee hit the jackpot: popularity, both online and on TV, and critical acclaim with I'm Sorry, I Love You (2004). Featuring So Ji-sub in his star-making performance, opposite rising actress Im Soo-jung, the plot involved overseas adoption, secrets of birth, terminal illness and a love triangle, but because of its focus on the pain and emotional conflicts of the characters, they were made realistic despite the over-the-top storyline. The drama was more emotionally intense than anything Lee had written before, and she was praised by viewers and critics for her well-written script that showed beauty in human tragedy. MiSa (as it's called by fans, the combined first two syllables of its Korean title Mianhada Saranghanda) became one of the rare \\"mania dramas\\" (Korean slang for TV series with tremendous online following) that also received high ratings, and it swept the 2004 KBS Drama Awards, while at the 2005 Baeksang Arts Awards So received Best TV Actor and Lee was nominated for Best TV Screenplay. Lee took it easy for a while after MiSa, and wrote two episodes of Beating Heart (2005), a drama with an experimental omnibus format of six two- part stories made by a different writer-director team. Lee paired with director Kim Jin-man in the segment Outing, which starred Bae Jong-ok as a forty-something woman having marital problems who meets the twenty-something doppelg√§nger of her college boyfriend (Ji Sung). It strengthened Lee's position as one of the most eclectic \\"commercial\\" writers on TV. Anticipation was high for her next work, and Lee again cast Rain as a K-1 fighter who plans revenge against the actress (Shin Min-ah) who drove his brother to attempted suicide. But despite stylish cinematography from director Kim Kyu-tae, A Love to Kill (2005) was a critical misfire with disappointing ratings. Lee reunited with another Sang Doo alum, Gong Hyo-jin, in Thank You (2007), about a single mother living on a small island with her grandfather who has dementia (Shin Goo) and her HIV-positive daughter (Seo Shin-ae), until a cynical doctor enters their lives. For the lead actor, Lee cast Jang Hyuk in his acting comeback after mandatory military service. Because of Jang's draft-dodging scandal, the drama received little hype, but the heartwarming story and well- drawn characters, as well as the cast's strong performances guided by director Lee Jae-dong (previously of Sweet Buns), led to solid ratings and it ranked number one in its timeslot. Some critics considered it arguably her finest work, and Lee won Best TV Screenplay at the 2008 Baeksang Arts Awards. It also received the 10th Special Media Award from Amnesty International, for \\"its frank, yet sensitive portrayal of a young HIV patient and her family and friends; it dealt with a touchy subject that had not been broached in other TV dramas and taught the audience to respect AIDS patients and other underprivileged members of our society.\\" Return to traditional melodrama In Will It Snow for Christmas? (2009), Lee returned to the genre of traditional melodrama. Directed by Choi Moon-suk (previously of What Happened in Bali) and starring Go Soo and Han Ye-seul, the tale of rekindled childhood love lost the ratings battle against blockbuster spy series Iris. Lee already had Song Joong-ki in mind as the antihero protagonist when she wrote The Innocent Man (2012). Titled in Korean \\"A Nice Guy the Likes of Which You Would Never Find Anywhere in the World,\\" it tells the story of a man who goes to prison for the woman he loves (Park Si-yeon), but is betrayed by her when she marries a business mogul for money. To get his revenge, he intentionally approaches her step-daughter (Moon Chae-won) to seduce her in order to provoke his ex-lover, creating complicated feelings of love and conflict among the three of them. Lee used the dualism of good and evil, love and revenge, to make her most cohesive, thematically strong drama yet, aided by director Kim Jin-won's unobtrusive yet unerring eye for detail. The cast's acting was praised across the board by viewers and critics, particularly Song for his nuanced portrayal, and The Innocent Man received high ratings throughout its run. In 2014, Lee reteamed with Kim Jin-won in Wonderful Days, her first time to write a 50-episode weekend drama. Starring Lee Seo-jin and Kim Hee-sun, the plot revolved around a prosecutor who returns to his hometown after 15 years and tries to reconnect with his long-estranged family and friends. Transfer to cable TV In 2019, Lee will do her first project under a pay TV network. Her upcoming work, Chocolate, will be broadcast on JTBC.JTBC ‚ÄúÏßÑÏÑúÏó∞ Ï∂úÏó∞ ÎÖºÏùò‚Äù‚Ä¶ÏßÄÎÇúÌï¥ Ï∂úÏÇ∞ ÌõÑ Î≥µÍ∑Ä ÏãúÎèô [Í≥µÏãùÏûÖÏû•] Critical assessment Lee's mixed success over the years is credited to the uneven nature of her scripts, and she's been criticized for giving little resonance to her dramas' ancillary characters, for her disinterest in well-researched profession-related dialogue, and her penchant for tragic endings. But she has also been praised for imbuing her characters with symbolic ambivalence and depth. She continues to be a sought-after writer in the drama industry for writing intelligent character studies that work despite, and sometimes transcend, \\"trendy drama\\" tropes and cliches. Other activities Lee is also a professor at Doowon Technical University College where she teaches television writing.

The Pony Express station at Mud Springs, staffed by U.S. soldiers, was attacked by Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribesmen during February 4‚Äì6, 1865, in what became known as the Battle of Mud Springs. In 1966, the site of the Pony Express station was a plot. Part of the present area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as Mud Springs Pony Express Station Site, and the listing was expanded to and renamed on the register in 2011. It has also been designated Nebraska historic site 25MO72. Brief History Mud Springs Station, a Native American territory in the olden times, served as a Pony Express site in 1860-61. It was named after the springs found at the opening of a canyon that divided Lodge Pole Creek and North Platte River Valleys, Dalton, Nebraska. The station served travelers en route the dry and arid trail from the Lodge Pole Creek to Oregon. In 1859, Mud Springs Station saw the coming of crude houses and a stage station for coach service, the movement called as Pony Express. But its life proved short-lived and in, 1861, abruptly ceased. But, as a legacy, a transcontinental telegraph station was established at Mud Springs Station and a daily stage coach service continued its service. The telegraph station, that served till 1876 proved a savior for Mud Spring Station, when an impending attack by the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians was thwarted by a SOS telegraph sent to the US troops. Today, as the last vestige of the Mud Spring Station, a stone monument, inlaid with a bronze Pony Express plaque, stands at the historic site. Currently, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, originally, the Pony Express Station site was donated in 1939 to the Nebraska State Historical Society, by the then site-owner, Mrs. Scherer.

The league was started in London, but by 1913 it had branches across England, in Wales and Scotland and Ireland. Aims and achievements This organisation aimed to 'Secure the Vote in Church and State as it is, or may be granted to men'. It was over a century later that females were permitted to be ordained as bishops within the Church of England. The Church League in 1914 allowed individuals to participate in other movements for the cause of women's equality but their own organisation's 'only methods.. are those of Prayer and Education\\". A benefit of the League was to refute the charge that the Church was indifferent to the matter of women's right to vote. The first woman to preach in a Church of Ireland church, which was done with the approval of the Archbishop of Dublin and the church's governors, was Edith Picton-Turbervill. She was speaking in Ireland under the auspices of the CLWS. Notable members CLWS meeting in Brighton in 1913 by Muriel Darton, a photographer who worked pro bono for suffrage causes. Florence Canning is the lady without a hat in the centre within a ring of clergy. The League was founded by the Reverend Claude Hinscliff in 1909, who was its secretary for a long time. Other founding members included Margaret Nevinson and Olive Wharry, and Joan Cather, whose husband Lt. John Leonard Cather was chair of its finance committee. Notable members included Frances Balfour and Louise Creighton and the more militant Muriel Matters, Florence Canning, the outstanding Maude Royden,and Lady Constance Lytton. Emily Wilding Davison, who died under the King's horse at Epsom, was a member, and her funeral was held at St George's, Bloomsbury, led by its vicar, Charles Baumgarten (also a member of the League), Claude Hinscliff, and Charles Escreet, Archdeacon of Lewisham. The Irish Church had resisted the League because it refused to denounce the behavior of militant suffragettes. By 1913 Florence Canning led the executive committee and she was one of six of the thirteen members identified for their militancy. The League of the Church Militant After the end of World War I, and the passage of the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave votes to many but not all women, the League decided to re-focus its efforts. In 1919 it renamed itself The League of the Church Militant. It continued to lobby to extend the franchise to achieve equality with men (Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928), and a range of other theologically liberal causes It also focussed its efforts on the ordination of women. However, its suffrage associations limited its work, and it dissolved shortly before the 1930 Lambeth Conference, a gathering of Anglican Communion bishops from around the world. It was replaced by the Anglican Group for the Ordination of Women to the Historic Ministry (1930-1978).

Career Kim Soon-ok graduated from Korea University in 1965 with a degree in Korean Language and Literature. She was hired at MBC after winning in their radio drama competition in 1968 with her radio play Í∑∏ Ìï¥ Í≤®Ïö∏Ïùò Ïö∞Ìôî (\\"The Fable of That Year's Winter\\"). Using the pen name Kim Soo-hyun, the first television drama she wrote, Rainbow, went on air in 1972. Over four decades, Kim became one of the most renowned screenwriters in Korea. Her body of work includes some of the most watched shows in Korean television history, including What is Love (1992), Men of the Bath House (1996), and Trap of Youth (1999). In his book Korea Through TV Drama, author Kim Hwan-pyo describes how the streets became quiet at around the airing time of Kim Soo-hyun's Love and Ambition (1987) as \\"practically everyone in the country\\" was at home in front of the TV. Kim specializes in stories about Korean family life ‚Äï how traditional values conflict with the new and how women struggle to adjust to or resist the cultural suppression at home and work. Her work tends to target an older audience, and she is also known for putting a spotlight on social issues rarely discussed by the public, making some of her work controversial. 2007‚Äìpresent: Works For My Husband's Woman (2007), a drama about a wife (played by Bae Jong-ok) who discovers her husband (Kim Sang-joong) is having an affair with her best friend (Kim Hee- ae), Kim infused her script with realism despite the provocative subject of adultery, saying that it reflects a society in which extra-marital affairs have become commonplace. Normally portrayed as a wicked woman, Kim humanized the mistress, saying, \\"If I chose between one of the two women and called it a victory, the script would have become didactic and banal. Each of the two take up 50 percent of my heart equally.\\" It was the second highest-rated Korean drama of 2007 (next to Jumong), and won Kim Hee-ae the Grand Prize (\\"Daesang\\") at the 2007 SBS Drama Awards. Later, Kim Soo-hyun strongly denied accusations of plagiarism by Ryu Gyeung-ok, who claimed that My Husband's Woman was very similar to her own TV drama That Woman, Ok-hui. In 2008's Mom's Dead Upset, a middle-aged woman rediscovers herself by taking a one-year break and declaring independence from her family after spending decades as a housewife looking after three children, a husband and a widowed father-in-law. Despite some viewers who called the character \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"self-centered\\" for deserting her family, the drama attracted record-breaking ratings, and lead actress Kim Hye-ja received the Grand Prize (\\"Daesang\\") at the 2008 KBS Drama Awards and the 2009 Baeksang Arts Awards. Kim said she wanted to \\"give a sabbatical year to all mothers,\\" and wrote the drama to liberate mothers from their stereotypes. Life Is Beautiful (2010) was the first network drama to feature an openly gay couple. Kim was both praised and panned for her openness in dealing with the subject of same-sex relationships, but she wrote without hesitation, saying, \\"I approached the issue of homosexuality as though it could have happened to my son.\\" Actors Song Chang-eui and Lee Sang-woo later praised her for giving their characters subtle and detailed development. In emphasizing the love between two handsome and intellectual people, Kim said her goal was to eradicate prejudice toward gay couples and make homosexuality no longer a taboo subject. In a society that is still conservative when it comes to homosexuality, the high ratings showed that viewers were largely supportive of the drama, which was extended for 13 additional episodes. Openly gay actor Hong Seok-cheon recalled that after he came out in 2000, he was fired from all his acting and hosting jobs, until Kim hired him in a supporting role in the 2003 drama Perfect Love. In A Thousand Days' Promise (2011), Kim explored the social problems associated with Alzheimer's disease, with Soo Ae giving an unsentimental portrait of a young woman slowly losing her memory and independence. Childless Comfort (2012), about a smart and highly educated single mother played by Uhm Ji-won, was a significant achievement when it became the highest rated Korean cable drama thus far, helping elevate struggling cable television network jTBC into becoming a true force in broadcasting. Its peak episode rating of 10.71% was an impressive number for pay-television standards because Korean cable channels rarely manage to touch 1 percent on most of their programs, whether they be dramas, sketch comedies, talk shows, documentaries and news. And at per episode, Kim was confirmed to be the highest-paid writer on Korean television. Personality and controversy Kim is also known for her fiery and outspoken personality. She is called by insiders as \\"a Godzilla\\" on set, for controlling actors' depictions of her characters. Famous for her intense but meaningful dialogue, ad-libbing is forbidden and actors are required to say their lines exactly as her script dictates, word-for-word, down to her trademark fast tempo. Kim admits that she's heard about actresses who cry in the bathroom because she forced them to act until she was satisfied. When Kim Hee-ae, lead actress of Kim's Perfect Love, lost the Grand Prize (\\"Daesang\\") at the 2003 SBS Drama Awards, Kim was quoted as saying, \\"The prize which is not given to the right one is just trash.\\" Kim Hee-ae later won the Grand Prize (\\"Daesang\\") at the 2004 Baeksang Arts Awards. Production on the TV drama Snow Flower was delayed because Kim, who had written the novel it was based on and had casting approval, opposed the proposal to cast singer Lee Hyori in one of the major roles (Go Ara was eventually cast). Kim had previously adapted her same-titled novel, which portrays the affection and conflict between a mother and her only daughter, into the 1992 film Flower in Snow starring Yoon Jeong-hee and Lee Mi-yeon. In 2010, she became involved in a public feud with director Im Sang-soo over the film The Housemaid. Kim had been hired to write the script for a remake of the 1960 classic, and after the director initially attached to it quit, Kim recommended Im to the producers. After Kim finished her script, Im made changes, reportedly to suit his provocative style, and Kim expressed her dissatisfaction, saying, \\"I was shocked when director Im returned the script to me. It was not edited but completely rewritten.\\" Kim claimed that Im apologized and agreed to collaborate on the script, but instead took his version to the studio without consulting her. Enraged, Kim withdrew from the project and later posted on her blog, \\"I've been stabbed in the back by someone I trusted [and] have no mind to go on with my work.\\" Already in her sixties when she joined Twitter, Kim has lambasted the Hollywood film Avatar, and the variety show I Am a Singer, and declared that more than half of the current TV dramas are crude, \\"as if they were written by middle school students.\\" When asked her opinion of makjang dramas, which use racy material including sex, betrayal and violence and have become increasingly available to the general viewing audience, she was firm in her response: \\"Many producers and writers point to the ratings or viewers as reasons why they are popular, but I think they are very irresponsible. People in the industry have a responsibility to maintain high standards for the viewers, not bring the bar down.\\" Critical assessment Despite the continuing popularity of her dramas, some critics are beginning to say that Kim's recent works have been mere parodies of her old ones. She has also been criticized for heavy-handed dialogue, and her overly conservative depictions of the Korean family ‚Äï the families she writes about are often of the traditional variety, with grandparents living with the parents and the children. But her work ethic has been lauded in the industry, as one of the few drama writers who turn in their scripts on time. Kim also wrote Mom's Dead Upset while recovering from breast cancer surgery. Views on writing According to Kim, the secret to writing a successful drama is in writing not with your brain but with your heart. She said, \\"All the characters are basically an embodiment of me. I get inside each and every character and write about their lives. If this is done only with your head, the characters fail to come to life and viewers don't want to know any more about them.\\" Selected as Korea's Leading Writer at the 2008 Seoul Drama Festival, Kim told the attendees, \\"There are over 1,000 members enrolled in the Korean TV and Radio Writers Association, but I doubt how many of them are real writers. If you want to be a good writer, forget about ratings or payment. If you are able to write a handsome drama, other things will follow naturally. I write dramas as I would create a work of art. I'll write dramas with such pride for the rest of my life.\\" In 2012, she received the prestigious Eungwan Order of Cultural Merit.

According to various sources, between 62 and 88 people were injured. The catastrophic conflagration is considered a prime example for a polystyrene fire, illustrating the flammability of such material. Approximately 1,000 firefighters were involved in extinguishing the blaze, which at the time was the largest fire response in the history of North Rhine-Westphalia. Cause and timeline The fire was caused by welding work done to an expansion joint on the elevated access road of Terminal A, which began at around 13:00. Droplets of molten metal started smouldering inside the polystyrene insulation on the dropped ceiling of the arrivals hall below. This slow fire spread out over a large area without being noticed. At 15:31, a taxi driver informed the fire department that he had observed a few sparks falling out of the ceiling in the arrivals area. Two members of the airport fire brigade arrived on the scene a few minutes later, initially suspecting an electrical failure. At around 15:45, they learned of the welding work directly above, thus being able to finally identify the probable origin. By that time, smoke could be seen emanating from ceiling vents. The situation ran completely out of control at 15:58. A flashover occurred, setting ablaze approximately of the ceiling within seconds. This was accompanied by an intense buildup of thick, black smoke. A total of 11 metric tons of polystyrene burned down, as well as numerous PVC cable coatings, releasing highly toxic substances including carbon monoxide, dioxins, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen chloride. As there was neither a sprinkler system nor fire doors (which was not mandatory at that time), a wall of smoke spread through the terminal building. At approximately 16:00 the headquarters of the airport fire brigade was informed about the extent of the fire, and reacted by calling for assistance from firefighters stationed in the adjacent municipalities. At 16:06, a general call for evacuation was put on the public address system of the airport. Until then, people in those parts of the airport that were not directly affected by the smoke had been unaware of the situation. Flight operations were halted at 16:36. Many of the firefighters did not have any experience with fires of that kind, and necessary supplies were missing. The airport fire brigade had only been trained to address aviation accidents, not how to respond to a fire inside the airport building. At 19:20, the fire was under control, and it was declared to be put out at 21:30. Victims All victims died from smoke inhalation rather than from heat injuries inflicted by the fire. Due to the thick smoke, nine passengers found themselves trapped inside the airport lounge of Air France on the mezzanine level above the arrivals hall of Terminal A. The self-service Salon was not staffed; passengers eligible to utilize the amenities were given an access code upon check-in. This may have contributed to the lack of knowledge about the nearest escape route which was only 8 metres away from the lounge exit. It led to a flat rooftop via two half staircases. Numerous phone calls were made from inside the lounge, the last one at 16:19. Although one of the victims described the location to be above the Lufthansa check-in, none of the involved personnel were aware of the exact location of the lounge, preventing it from being evacuated in time. All but one occupant suffocated. A French business man managed to escape by smashing a window with a chair and falling 4 metres to the lower level. He was rescued at around 17:00, suffering from serious head injuries. He fully recovered from his injuries. Seven people died in two elevators bringing people from the airport parking garage into the Terminal A arrivals hall, which at the time was fully ablaze. The victims had entered the elevators unaware of the fire, only to find themselves exposed to thick, toxic smoke which obstructed the optical door sensors, causing the elevator doors to remain open. A British soldier died inside a lavatory at the arrivals level of Terminal A. The last victim, an elderly woman, had initially escaped the fire but died two weeks later due to the consequences of smoke inhalation. Aftermath Due to the effects of fire and smoke, Terminals A and B were rendered unusable, and the total damage was estimated at DM 1 billion. Several airlines temporarily moved their operations to nearby Cologne/Bonn Airport, until tents had been put up at D√ºsseldorf Airport to provide interim check-in and baggage claim services. These were later replaced by light-metal barracks (Terminals D and E). By 1 July 1996, D√ºsseldorf Airport had returned to 90 percent of its original passenger capacity. Terminal A was extensively renovated, and Terminal B was demolished completely and rebuilt; the terminals reopened in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Investigation The official investigation into the accident revealed a number of safety and procedural flaws, as well as possible criminal offences: *The airport fire brigade had not been informed about the welding work, otherwise a fire watch would have been dispatched. *The highly flammable polystyrene sheeting inside the ceiling was installed illegally. *There were no operational procedures for a fire inside the terminal building. Firefighters were missing floor plans and access keys, and communication problems were encountered between members of the airport fire brigade and external forces. *The elevators were not put out of service once the general fire alarm was called. In late 1996, a court trial was opened, charging a number of people including the two welders, the technical director of the airport, the architect, as well as building inspectors and supervisors. Following lengthy arguments over procedural questions, the case was postponed several times and finally abandoned in 2001, without a verdict identifying those responsible for the disaster.

Based in the regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia-Giulia the corps was the army's main combat force. The 5th Army Corps was arrayed close to the Yugoslavian border and tasked with meeting any Warsaw Pact forces that crossed the border. On the left flank of the corps the 4th Alpine Army Corps was tasked with blocking the Alpine passes and in the rear of the corps the 3rd Army Corps served as operational reserve. After the end of the Cold War the corps was reduced in size and on 1 October 1997 it became the 1st Defence Forces Command (COMFOD 1¬∞). In 2013 the COMFOD 1¬∞ was disbanded and its function and brigades taken over by the 20th Infantry Division Friuli in Florence.  History   Origins  The history of the 5th Army Corps begins with Garibaldis Expedition of the Thousand. After Garibaldi scored victory after victory in his conquest of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia decided to march south to secure the conquered territory for himself and thus unite Italy. The V Army Corps was raised and marched south with the main Army where it fought in the battles of San Giuliano on 26 October 1860 and Garigliano on 29 October 1860 and participated in the siege of Gaeta. After the war the corps was garrisoned in Florence, the capital of the newly united Italy. It commanded two elite divisions: the 1st Division of the Line in Florence and the 15th Division of the Line in Perugia. Both divisions were made up by Grenadier regiments. At the outbreak of the third Italian war of independence the V Army Corps remained at first in Florence, but when the main Italian army failed to break through the Austrian Quadrilatero fortress system south of Lake Garda in the Battle of Custoza, the corps marched six divisions over the Apennine mountains, joined up with General Enrico Cialdinis eight divisions of the IV Army Corps in the Romagna and crossed the lower Po and Adige rivers in force on 11 July 1866. Bypassing the Austrian fortresses and main army on his left flank Cialdini marched his army all through the Veneto, dispatching one division under Giacomo Medici to invade Trentino and cut the Austrian line of retreat and three divisions under Raffaele Cadorna to march at speed to the city of Trieste. Cialdinis army reached the Isonzo river on 24 July 1866.  World War I  The Asiago plateau after the Battle of Asiago After the Italian declaration of war against the Austrian Empire on 23 May 1915 the V Army Corps under Lieutenant General Florenzio Aliprandi as part of the 1st Army advanced into Trentino. On the corps left flank the III Army Corps advanced through the Valtellina, Camonica Trompia and Chiese valleys and along the Western shore of Lake Garda. The ultimate goal of the 1st Army was to reach the city of Trento. Although numerically superior the corps failed to reach the city of Trento and its advance through the Adige and Valsugana valleys and over the Asiago plateau soon bogged down in determined Austrian resistance. The corps consisted of the 9th and 15th Division of the Line (Infantry), the 34th Territorial Division, the 2nd, 4th and 8th Bersaglieri regiments and the 6th Alpini Regiment. All soldiers of the 6th Alpini Regiment had been recruited from valleys in the area of operations and thus fought in a territory they knew perfectly well. However the 6th Alpini Regiment was never employed as a whole, but single companies or battalions were given specific mountain summits, ridges or passes to conquer and hold. * V Army Corps (Lieutenant General Florenzio Aliprandi) ** 9th Division of the Line (Major General Ferri) *** Brigade of the Line Puglie **** 71st Line Infantry Regiment **** 72nd Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Roma **** 79th Line Infantry Regiment **** 80th Line Infantry Regiment *** 29th Territorial Field Artillery Regiment (8x batteries) *** 12th Sapper Company / 1st Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 15th Division of the Line (Major General Lenchanti) *** Brigade of the Line Abruzzi **** 57th Line Infantry Regiment **** 58th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Venezia **** 83rd Line Infantry Regiment **** 84th Line Infantry Regiment *** 19th Field Artillery Regiment (6x batteries) *** 1st Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 34th Territorial Division (Major General Oro) *** Brigade of the Line Treviso **** 115th Line Infantry Regiment **** 116th Line Infantry Regiment *** Brigade of the Line Ivrea **** 161st Line Infantry Regiment **** 162nd Line Infantry Regiment *** 2x squadrons of the 22nd Cavalleggeri di Catania Cavalry Regiment *** 41st Territorial Field Artillery Regiment (6x batteries) *** 9th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment *** Divisional Service units ** 2nd Bersaglieri Regiment (II, IV, XVII, XLI Bersaglieri battalions) ** 4th Bersaglieri Regiment (XXIX, XXXI, XXXVII, XLII Bersaglieri battalions) ** 8th Bersaglieri Regiment (V, XII, XXXVIII, XLVIII Bersaglieri battalions) ** 6th Alpini Regiment (Verona, Vicenza, Bassano, Val d'Adige, Val Leogra, Val Brenta Alpini battalions) ** Feltre and Val Cismon Alpini battalions from the 7th Alpini Regiment ** 22nd Cavalleggeri di Catania Cavalry Regiment ** I Guardia di Finanza Frontier Battalion ** V, VII, IX, XVII, XVIII Guardia di Finanza Coastal Battalion ** 5th Field Artillery Regiment (8x batteries) ** II Group Torino-Aosta / 1st Mountain Artillery Regiment ** VII Group Vicenza / 2nd Mountain Artillery Regiment ** IX Group Oneglia / 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment ** X Group Genova / 3rd Mountain Artillery Regiment ** 3x tunnelling engineer companies ** 16th Sapper Company / 1st Engineer Regiment ** 16th Sapper Company / 2nd Engineer Regiment ** 11th Telegraph Engineers Company ** Army Corps Service units After the initial advance had been brought to a halt by the Austro-Hungarian Army the corps dug in and, although fierce fighting continued the front in the corps' sector remained almost unchanged until 15 May 1916 when Austria unleashed its first major offensive on the Italian front on the Asiago plateau. The V Corps was badly mauled by the Austrian superiority in men and material but did not break. As the Russians began the Brusilov Offensive, on 4 June the Austro-Hungarian High Command decided do end its offensive operations in Italy before its strategic goal - a breakthrough into the Venetian plains behind the main Italian Army - had been achieved. After the end of the Austrian offensive the corps remained in the same area of operation until the end of the war.  World War II  After the war the V Army Corps was garrisoned in Trieste and consisted of the 12th Infantry Division Timavo in Trieste and the 15th Infantry Division Carnaro in Pola. At the outbreak of World War II the corps was guarding the border with Yugoslavia. Headquartered in Pivka it consisted of the 12th Infantry Division Sassari, 15th Infantry Division Bergamo and 57th Infantry Division Lombardia. On 6 April 1941 it participated in the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. After the end of combat operations the corps took up garrison duties along the Dalmatian coast, but found itself quickly fighting Yugoslav partisans. After Germany invaded Italy following the Italian-Allied armistice in September 1943 the corps was disbanded by the Germans. The corps was garrisoned in Crikvenica at the time and consisted of the 153rd Infantry Division Macerata in Delnice, 154th Infantry Division Murge in Sinj and the XIV Coastal Brigade in Crikvenica.  Cold War  In 1945 the V Territorial Military Command was activated in Padova which at the time controlled only the 5th Alpini Regiment. But already by 1947 the command had grown to include the Infantry Division Folgore in Treviso and the Infantry Division Mantova in Gorizia. Both divisions were units of the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and had served on the Allied side during the Italian campaign. In 1948 the command was augmented with the Armored Brigade Ariete in Pordenone and in 1949 with the Alpine Brigade Julia in Cividale del Friuli. The command was tasked with defending the Italian Eastern borders: the Mantova was to defend the city of Gorizia, while the Julia covered the commands left flank in the Carnic Alps. The fully motorized Folgore was tasked to advance to the Free Territory of Trieste and support the Trieste United States Troops, while the Ariete with its M4 Sherman tanks, M3 Half-tracks and M7 Priests served as the commands mobile reserve. To cover its right flank against enemy amphibious landings the command raised the Lagunari troops in Venice on 15 January 1951. On 1 May 1952 the V Territorial Military Command was renamed as V Army Corps and as the West-East confrontation became more dire the Ariete tripled in size and became the Armored Division Ariete on 1 October 1952. division also exchanged its Sherman tanks for more powerful M26 Pershings. On 30 September the corps 1953 moved to Vittorio Veneto and ceded command of the Julia brigade to the new Carnia- Cadore Troops Command, which covered the V Army Corps left flank. Over the next years the corps added further units to keep up with the geo-political situation of the Cold War: the Ariete was further increased and received M47 Patton tanks and M113 armored personnel carriers, as well as one artillery group armed with M44 self-propelled howitzers and one artillery group armed with M110 self-propelled howitzers. The Mantova and Folgore infantry divisions were each increased by one infantry regiment and both received a tank battalion with M47 Patton tanks. In Trieste the 151st Infantry Regiment Sassari and the 14th Field Artillery Regiment formed the Trieste Troops Command tasked with defending the city. At the same time the Lagunari regiment in Venice grew to three amphibious battalions and one tank battalion with M47 Patton tanks. In Gorizia on 1 January 1959 the mechanized Cavalry Brigade Pozzuolo del Friuli activated with two mechanized, one tank battalion and one self-propelled artillery group, to replace the Mantova division, which had moved its headquarters to Udine. The most significant addition to the corps was the III Missile Brigade. The brigade activated on 1 October 1959 in Vicenza and initially consisted of one missile artillery regiment with two missile groups, each of which was armed with eight Honest John missile launchers. The MGR-1 Honest John was a nuclear-capable surface-to-surface missile intended to destroy the large Warsaw Pact armored formations. By the 1963, when the brigades headquarters was moved to Portogruaro, the brigade contained four missile groups and one group with M115 howitzers. The corps - along with the 3rd Army Corps and 4th Army Corps was part of NATOs Allied Land Forces Southern Europe Command (LANDSOUTH) in Verona. In 1975 the Italian Army undertook a major reorganisation: the regiment level was abolished and battalions came under direct command of brigades, which combined units from different combat arms. In the same year the spelling of the name of the corps was changed from V Army Corps to 5th Army Corps. Therefore, the 5th Army Corps' new structure at the end of 1975 was as follows: Structure of the 5th Army Corps in 1986 before the divisional level was abolished (click to enlarge) * 30px 5th Army Corps in Vittorio Veneto ** 30px Armored Division Ariete in Pordenone *** 30px 8th Mechanized Brigade Garibaldi in Pordenone *** 30px 32nd Armored Brigade Mameli in Tauriano *** 30px 132nd Armored Brigade Manin in Aviano ** 30px Mechanized Division Folgore in Treviso *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Gorizia in Gorizia *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Trieste in Bologna *** 30px Armored Brigade Vittorio Veneto in Villa Opicina *** Amphibious Troops Command (Lagunari) in Venice-Lido ** 30px Mechanized Division Mantova in Udine *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Brescia in Brescia *** 30px Mechanized Brigade Isonzo in Cividale del Friuli *** 30px Armored Brigade Pozzuolo del Friuli in Palmanova ** 30px 3rd Missile Brigade Aquileia in Portogruaro ** 30px Trieste Troops Command in Trieste In 1976 the entire corps was heavily involved in the rescue and cleanup efforts after the 1976 Friuli earthquake. Structure of the 5th Army Corps in 1989 at the End of the Cold War (click to enlarge) In 1986 the Italian Army abolished the divisional level and realigned its forces to counter a possible Warsaw Pact attack better. The 5th Army Corps was to destroy enemy forces within the region of Friuli-Venezia- Giulia, while the 4th Alpine Army Corps covered the V Army Corps' left flank and the 3rd Army Corps was the operational reserve. As two of the V Army Corps' mechanized brigades were based outside its area of operation, the V Corps lost these two brigades to the 3rd Army Corps: the Brescia in Brescia and the Trieste in Bologna. As the Ariete and Mantova divisions carried historically significant names - the Ariete having fought bravely in the Siege of Tobruk and Battle of Gazala and fought to annihilation in the Second Battle of El Alamein, and the Mantova being one of the divisions that fought in the Italian Co-Belligerent Army to liberate Italy from Nazi-occupation - the army decided to rename the 132nd Armored Brigade Manin as 132nd Armored Brigade Ariete and the Mechanized Brigade Isonzo as Mechanized Brigade Mantova. Although the Folgore divisions carried and equally significant name the army decided to transfer the traditions of the Folgore division to the existing Parachute Brigade Folgore. After the reform of 1986 the V Corps was structured as follows: * 30px 5th Army Corps in Vittorio Veneto ** 30px Armored Brigade Mameli in Tauriano ** 30px Armored Brigade Ariete in Aviano ** 30px Armored Brigade Pozzuolo del Friuli in Palmanova ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Vittorio Veneto in Villa Opicina ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Garibaldi in Pordenone ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Gorizia in Gorizia ** 30px Mechanized Brigade Mantova in Udine ** 30px 3rd Missile Brigade Aquileia in Portogruaro ** Amphibious Troops Command (Lagunari) in Venice-Lido Each mechanized brigade fielded about 4,700 men, while the armored brigades fielded about 3,400 men. Together with the corps' support units the entire corps fielded over 60,000 men.  After the Cold War  With the end of the Cold War the Italian Army began a decade long reduction of its forces. The first brigade to disband was the Mameli on 1 April 1991, followed by the Vittorio Veneto on 31 July 1991. The units subordinated to these brigades were mostly disbanded, with a few units joining other brigades. The Garibaldi completed its move to Caserta in the South of Italy on 1 July 1991 and left the 5th Army Corps on that day. Finally on 1 December 1991 the Aquileia was reduced to 3rd Artillery Regiment Aquileia, which was then disbanded in September 1992. Over the next few years the Trieste Troops Command and the Amphibious Troops Command were disbanded. In 1997 the army undertook the next big reform process and the 5th Army Corps saw its Gorizia and Mantova brigades disbanded on 30 August 1997, but it received the Mechanized Brigade Centauro from the 3rd Army Corps. On 1 October 1997 the 5th Army Corps changed its name and became the 1st Defence Forces Command (1¬∞ Comando Forze di Difesa or COMFOD 1¬∞). The new structure of the corps was: * COMFOD 1¬∞ in Vittorio Veneto ** 132nd Armored Brigade Ariete in Pordenone ** Cavalry Brigade Pozzuolo del Friuli in Gorizia ** Mechanized Brigade Centauro in Novara ** 7th Signal Regiment (1x battalion) in Sacile ** 3rd Engineer Regiment (1x battalion) in Udine ** 1st Infantry Regiment San Giusto (1x training battalion) in Trieste ** 7th Infantry Regiment Cuneo (1x training battalion) in Udine ** 11th Infantry Regiment Casale (1x training battalion) in Casale Monferrato On 1 December 2000 the Projection Forces Command (COMFOP) ceded two of its brigades - the Parachute Brigade Folgore and Air Assault Brigade Friuli to the 1st Defence Forces Command. In 2002 the command changed composition for the last time: the Centauro brigade was disbanded on 5 October 2002 and all support units were either disbanded or transferred to other commands. However, in the same year the command began to build up a deployable division-level headquarters. Said headquarters became operational in October 2005 and was given the name Mantova Division Command.  Today  Before being disbanded the 1st Defence Forces Command was located in the northern Italian City of Vittorio Veneto and consisted of the following units: * 25px Mantova Division Command (without fixed units) in Vittorio Veneto * 25px Armored Brigade Ariete in Pordenone * 25px Cavalry Brigade Pozzuolo del Friuli in Gorizia * 25px Parachute Brigade Folgore in Livorno * 25px Air Assault Brigade Friuli in Bologna  External links  * History of the 5th Army Corps - Italian Army Homepage Category:Corps of Italy ","title":"5th Army Corps (Italy)"},{"id":"39446701","text":"SM UB-142 was a German Type UB III submarine or U-boat in the German Imperial Navy () during World War I.

It dates back to 1684 when a Franciscan convent was built on the site but in the 19th century it served as a barracks, a hospital and a college. In 1876, under President Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, the Universidad de Caracas was moved to the building, whose former colonial fa√ßade was rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style. After the university relocated to a new campus in 1952, the building became home to the National Academies. In 1965, it was listed as a national monument.Dr. Leopoldo Brice√±o Iragorry, junior, \\"El Paraninfo del Palacio de las Academias, Personajes\\", Gaceta M√©dica de Caracas. Retrieved 21 May 2013. The Palacio de las Academias now houses six National Academies, which are the National Academy of History, the Venezuelan Academy of Language, the Academy of Medicine, the Academy of Political and Social Sciences, the Academy of Jurisprudence, and the Academy of Physics, Mathematics and Nature. Location The building is located on the corner of Avenida Universidad and La Bolsa in Caracas. It can be reached via the metro at the Capitolio/El Silencio station. The Iglesia de San Francisco (Church of San Francisco) is situated to the right and south of the building and next to the palacio, having been constructed as an annex to the building when it was a convent. History The Iglesia de San Francisco and part of the Convent of San Francisco (1845). The Convent of San Francisco was the first of many which were built in the valleys of Caracas. Founded in 1576 and built within the next ten years, it was initially under Franciscan friars until 1597 when it was transferred to the Dominicans. From 1673, laymen could study in the classrooms. It was supplemented with another building at the back in 1794, which was damaged by the great earthquake of 1812. By the 1820s, it was one of 40 convents in the city. By 1835, the National Library was situated in the convent. Diego Bautista Urbaneja was the first director (c. 1833-35). The building gained a new fa√ßade in 1876 during the presidency of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco. Initially the San Francisco Convent, then the Central University of Venezuela, the building later became known as the Biblioteca or the Central Library. Since the tenure of President P√©rez Jim√©nez, it has been called the Palace of the Academies. Architecture and fittings The building, photographed 2007 Asamblea Nacional desde el Palacio de las Academias During refurbishing work in 1876, a south courtyard was added, the north fa√ßade was extended, and the interiors were renovated.

Upon Papua New Guinea's independence on September 16, 1975 the Philippine consulate in Port Moresby was upgraded to an embassy making the Philippines one of the first countries to formalize diplomatic relations with Papua New Guinea. Economic relations In March 2009, The Philippines and Papua New Guinea entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that would enhance the cooperation between the two countries on the development of fisheries. The MoU will facilitate technology transfer in aquaculture development, promotion of shipping ventures, investments, technical training, joint research, and ‚Äústrategic complementation‚Äù of each country‚Äôs plans in the Coral Triangle ‚Äì or the waters between the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Pacific Islands. The fisheries trade is significantly responsible for recent overall trade growth between the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. In March 2012 the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) has started discussions with Papua New Guinea officials on the issues of access and trade. Under the proposed agreement, Papua New Guinea is willing to give fishing rights to Filipino commercial fishermen in its waters in exchange for agricultural commodities and rice. There are about 25,000 Filipinos currently in Papua New Guinea as of 2013.

They consist of complex multi-layer structures requiring nanometer scale accuracy and an elaborate design. Their theoretical description is important not only from a fundamental point of view, but also in order to generate new and improved designs. It is common to all systems that the laser is an inverted carrier density system. The carrier inversion results in an electromagnetic polarization which drives an electric field E(t). In most cases, the electric field is confined in a resonator, the properties of which are also important factors for laser performance. Gain medium Comparison of gain and absorption calculated in Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation (dotted line) and fully taking into account collision terms (solid line). The sample is a Ga(AsSb) quantum well surrounded by GaAs spacers. For the top figure, a density of 1.3 x 1012 cm‚àí2 was used which is well above lasing threshold. For the bottom figure, the carrier density is negligible. The differences in lineshape are obvious especially for the lasing structure. The Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation leads to absorption below the bandgap (below about 0.94 eV), which is a natural consequence of the relaxation time approximation, but is completely unphysical. For the low density case, the T2-time approximation also leads to extended tails. In semiconductor laser theory, the optical gain is produced in a semiconductor material. The choice of material depends on the desired wavelength and properties such as modulation speed. It may be a bulk semiconductor, but more often a quantum heterostructure. Pumping may be electrically or optically (disk laser). All these structures can be described in a common framework and in differing levels of complexity and accuracy.Chow, W. W.; Koch, S. W. (2011). Semiconductor-Laser fundamentals. Springer. Light is generated in a semiconductor laser by radiative recombination of electrons and holes. In order to generate more light by stimulated emission than is lost by absorption, the system has to be inverted, see the article on lasers. A laser is, thus, always a high carrier density system that entails many-body interactions. These cannot be taken into account exactly because of the high number of particles involved. Various approximations can be made: * Free carrier model: In simple models, many-particle interactions are often neglected. The carrier plasma is then simply seen as a reservoir which relaxes the carrier distributions. However, the many body interaction is necessary to produce the correct linewidth. Therefore, at the free carrier level a scattering time has to be introduced phenomenologically, usually extracted from experiment, but will change with carrier density and temperature. Simple models for the gain coefficient are often used to obtain a system of laser diode rate equations, enabling one to dynamically calculate the time-dependent laser response. An expression for the free-carrier gain is given in the article on semiconductor optical gain. * Hartree Fock approximation: To describe an interacting carrier system at any density, the semiconductor Bloch equationsLindberg, M.; Koch, S. (1988). \\"Effective Bloch equations for semiconductors\\". Physical Review B 38 (5): 3342‚Äì3350. doi:10.1103/PhysRevB.38.3342Haug, H.; Koch, S. W. (2009). Quantum Theory of the Optical and Electronic Properties of Semiconductors (5th ed.). World Scientific. p. 216. (SBEs) may be employed. These may be solved in the Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation.Haug, H.; Schmitt-Rink, S. (1984). \\"Electron theory of the optical properties of laser-excited semiconductors\\". Progress in Quantum Electronics 9 (1): 3‚Äì100. doi:10.1016/0079-6727(84)90026-0 In this case, carrier‚Äìcarrier interaction leads to renormalisation terms for band structure and electric field. The collision terms, i.e., the terms describing carrier‚Äìcarrier scattering, still do not occur and have to be introduced phenomenologically using a relaxation time or T2-time for the polarization. * Correlation effects: Taking the collision terms into account explicitly requires a large numerical effort, but can be done with state-of-the-art computers.Hader, J.; Moloney, J. V.; Koch, S. W.; Chow, W. W. (2003). \\"Microscopic modeling of gain and luminescence in semiconductors\\". IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quant. Electron. 9 (3): 688‚Äì697. doi:10.1109/JSTQE.2003.818342 Technically speaking, the collision terms in the semiconductor Bloch equations are included in second-Born approximation. This microscopic model has the advantage of having predictive character, i.e., it yields the correct linewidth for any temperature or excitation density. In the other models, the relaxation time has to be extracted from experiment, but depends on the actual parameters meaning the experiment has to be redone for any temperature and excitation intensity. The above-mentioned models yield the polarization of the gain medium. From this, the absorption \\\\alpha or gain g may be calculated via where \\\\hbar\\\\omega denotes the photon energy, n_\\\\mathrm{b} is the background refractive index, c is the vacuum speed of light, \\\\epsilon_0 and \\\\epsilon are the vacuum permittivity and background dielectric constant, respectively, and E(\\\\omega) is the electric field present in the gain medium. \\"\\\\operatorname{Im}\\" denotes the imaginary part of the quantity in brackets. The above formula can be derived from Maxwell's equations. The figure shows a comparison of the calculated absorption spectra for high density where absorption becomes negative (gain) and low density absorption for the two latter theoretical approaches discussed. The differences in lineshape for the two theoretical approaches are obvious especially for the high carrier density case which applies to a laser system. The Hartree‚ÄìFock approximation leads to absorption below the bandgap (below about 0.94 eV), which is a natural consequence of the relaxation time approximation, but is completely unphysical. For the low density case, the T2-time approximation also overestimates the strength of the tails. Laser resonator A resonator is usually part of a semiconductor laser. Its effects have to be taken into account in the calculation. Therefore, the eigenmode expansion of the electric field is done not in plane waves but in the eigenmodes of the resonator which may be calculated, e.g., via the transfer-matrix method in planar geometries; more complicated geometries often require the use of full Maxwell-equations solvers (finite-difference time-domain method). In the laser diode rate equations, the photon life time \\\\tau_p enters instead of the resonator eigenmodes. In this approximative approach, \\\\tau_p may be calculated from the resonance modeSmith, F. (1960). \\"Lifetime Matrix in Collision Theory\\".

This approach includes many-body interactions and correlation effects systematically, including correlations between quantized light and the excitations of the semiconductor.

This theory investigates a fireball for high-energy particle collisions, while using Tsallis non-extensive thermodynamics. Fireballs lead to the bootstrap idea, or self-consistency principle, just as in the Boltzmann statistics used by Rolf Hagedorn. Assuming the distribution function gets variations, due to possible symmetrical change, Abdel Nasser Tawfik applied the non-extensive concepts of high-energy particle production. The motivation to use the non-extensive statistics from TsallisC. Tsallis, J Stat Phys 52, 479-487, 1988 comes from the results obtained by Bediaga et alI. Bediaga, E.M.F. Curado and J.M. de Miranda, Physica A 286 (2000) 156.. They showed that with the substitution of the Boltzmann factor in Hagedorn's theory by the q-exponential function, it was possible to recover good agreement between calculation and experiment, even at energies as high as those achieved at the LHC, with q>1. Non-extensive entropy for ideal quantum gas The starting point of the theory is entropy for a non-extensive quantum gas of bosons and fermions, as proposed by Conroy, Miller and Plastino, which is given by S_q=S_q^{FD}+S_q^{BE} where S_q^{FD} is the non-extended version of the Fermi‚ÄìDirac entropy and S_q^{BE} is the non-extended version of the Bose‚ÄìEinstein entropy. That group and also Clemens and Worku, the entropy just defined leads to occupation number formulas that reduce to Bediaga's. C. Beck, shows the power-like tails present in the distributions found in high energy physics experiments.  Non-extensive partition function for ideal quantum gas  Using the entropy defined above, the partition function results are : \\\\ln[1+Z_q(V_o,T)]=\\\\frac{V_o}{2\\\\pi^2}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}dm \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}dp \\\\, p^2 \\\\rho(n;m)[1+(q-1)\\\\beta \\\\sqrt{p^2+m^2}]^{-\\\\frac{nq}{(q-1)}} \\\\,. Since experiments have shown that q>1, this restriction is adopted. Another way to write the non-extensive partition function for a fireball is : Z_q(V_o,T)=\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}\\\\sigma(E)[1+(q-1)\\\\beta E]^{-\\\\frac{q}{(q-1)}} dE\\\\,, where \\\\sigma(E) is the density of states of the fireballs. Self-consistency principle Self-consistency implies that both forms of partition functions must be asymptotically equivalent and that the mass spectrum and the density of states must be related to each other by : log[\\\\rho(m)]= log[\\\\sigma(E)] , in the limit of m,E sufficiently large. The self-consistency can be asymptotically achieved by choosingA. Deppman, Physica A 391 (2012) 6380. : m^{3/2} \\\\rho(m)=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{m}\\\\big[1+(q_o-1) \\\\beta _o m\\\\big]^{\\\\frac{1}{q_o -1}}=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{m}[1+(q'_o-1) m]^{\\\\frac{\\\\beta _o}{q'_o -1}} and :\\\\sigma(E)=bE^a\\\\big[1+(q'_o-1)E\\\\big]^{\\\\frac{\\\\beta _o}{q'_o -1}}\\\\,, where \\\\gamma is a constant and q'_o-1=\\\\beta _o (q_o-1). Here, a,b,\\\\gamma are arbitrary constants. For q' \\\\rightarrow 1 the two expressions above approach the corresponding expressions in Hagedorn's theory. Main results With the mass spectrum and density of states given above, the asymptotic form of the partition function is : Z_q(V_o,T) \\\\rightarrow \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta - \\\\beta _o }\\\\bigg)^{\\\\alpha} where :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma V_o}{2\\\\pi^2 \\\\beta^{3/2}}\\\\,, with : a+1=\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma V_o}{2\\\\pi^2 \\\\beta^{3/2}} \\\\,. One immediate consequence of the expression for the partition function is the existence of a limiting temperature T_o=1/\\\\beta _o. This result is equivalent to Hagedorn's result.R. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147. With these results, it is expected that at sufficiently high energy, the fireball presents a constant temperature and constant entropic factor. The connection between Hagedorn's theory and Tsallis statistics has been established through the concept of thermofractals, where it is shown that non extensivity can emerge from a fractal structure. This result is interesting because Hagedorn's definition of fireball characterizes it as a fractal. Experimental evidence Experimental evidence of the existence of a limiting temperature and of a limiting entropic index can be found in J. Cleymans and collaborators,J. Cleymans and D. Worku, J.

His research interests include mechanisms of insulin action in the ovary, endocrinological aspects of AIDS, and clinical outcomes in diabetes. He has authored over 100 publications and has served on the National Institutes of Health's review committees and on the editorial boards of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism and other endocrine journals. As of 2014 he is a professor of medicine at Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in Hempstead, New York, and Chief of the Division of Endocrinology at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, New York. Early life, career Leonid Poretsky was born on August 7, 1954 in Leningrad, Russian SSR. His mother, Nina, was a well known pediatrician from Bobruisk, Belarus who lived and worked in Leningrad. His father was a prominent engineer. Poretsky graduated from First (Pavlov) Medical Institute in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg State Medical University), cum laude in 1977. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1979. Upon completing his internal medicine residency program, he began a fellowship in endocrinology and metabolism at Boston‚Äôs Beth Israel Hospital (now Beth Israel/Deaconess Medical Center). He also completed a research fellowship in medicine at Harvard Medical School (1983-1985), where he was mentored by Dr. Jeffrey Flier. Beth Israel Medical Center While at Beth Israel Medical Center (2000 - 2014), Dr. Poretsky served as Chief of the Division of Endocrinology, Vice-Chairman for Research, and Interim Chairman in the Department of Medicine. He held the Gerald J. Friedman endowed chair in endocrinology and metabolism at Beth Israel Medical Center and was a founding director of the Gerald J. Friedman Diabetes Institute. Gerald J. Friedman Diabetes Institute is an education, clinical management and research program focused on diabetes which requires no insurance or physician referral. At the institute Poretsky chairs the annual Friedman Fellows Symposia, which present the work of fellows from around the US supported by The Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman New York Foundation for Medical Research.  Lenox Hill Hospital In September 2014, Dr. Poretsky joined the staff of Lenox Hill Hospital as its Chief of the Division of Endocrinology. He is leading the effort to develop academic and clinical programs. An endocrinology fellowship program was initiated in July 2016 and a new site for the Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman Diabetes Institute at Lenox Hill Hospital opened on August 1, 2016. Another specialized program in the division--Friedman Transgender Health and Wellness Program--opened in 2017. The division has numerous grants from philanthropic organizations, industry and government agencies (New York State Department of Health and the National Institutes of Health). Lenox Hill Hospital is a part of Northwell Health, formerly North Shore ‚Äì LIJ Health System, a network of hospitals, nursing homes, a medical school, a nursing school, a medical research institute, ambulatory care centers, urgent care centers, a health insurance company, and laboratories. Dr. Poretsky has regularly appeared in the New York Times Magazine Best Doctors List and the U.S. News & World Report Best Doctors List. Publishing Medical texts Poretsky has authored over 100 publications, and has served on the editorial board of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, Journal of Diabetes, and other publications. He contributed to and edited the comprehensive textbook Principles of Diabetes Mellitus, which has been widely cited, and has gone through three editions so far (2002, 2010 and 2017). The book covers a wide range of topics on diabetes. In 2012 he edited Diabetes Mellitus: A Concise Clinical Guide, which covers \\"the basics of diagnosis, complications, therapies and prevention of diabetes.\\" The book consists of sections originally published in the second edition of Principles of Diabetes Mellitus. He is also a series editor for ‚ÄúContemporary Endocrinology‚Äù. (Springer, Inc.) A comprehensive textbook \\"Transgender Medicine - Multidisciplinary Approach\\" co-edited by Leonid Poretsky, MD and Wylie Hembree, MD was published in 2019 (Springer Publishers, Inc.) Public policy Poretsky has been vocal in the media about how health care policy can affect patient care. In the 1990s he wrote a letter to the editor of New York Times concerning how Medicaid payment caps can limit physicians' availability to patients. In July 2012 he wrote an op-ed for Forbes which drew comparisons between the bureaucratic behavior of the American healthcare system and that of the Soviet Union's, which he says \\"collapsed under the weight of its own bureaucratic inefficiencies two decades ago.\\" This article was followed by a scholarly publication on the subject entitled ‚ÄúThe sovietization of American medicine: Notes from the front lines‚Äù, which appeared in Journal in American Physicians and Surgeons, 2013. In 2013 he published a letter in the Wall Street Journal talking about inadequate methods used by the government to assess hospital performance and a letter regarding policy changes needed to reduce hospital readmissions. In 2017, he published a letter about Medicare being allowed to compete with private health insurance plans. Notable research Insulin in the human ovary While working as a research fellow at Harvard in the early 1980s, Poretsky became known for discovering, describing and characterizing insulin receptors in the human ovary. Before his research, the hormone insulin had been known to primarily regulate glucose and other fuel metabolism in the liver, fat, and muscle. His work established the ovary as a target for regulation by insulin, and introduced a new paradigm for the gonadotropic function of insulin. Poretsky had been researching the causes of hyperandrogenism (high level of male hormones and male features in females) in patients with extreme forms of insulin resistance, for example in people with insulin receptor gene mutations. Subsequently, Poretsky‚Äôs work became important for understanding more common disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which affects up to 10% of reproductive age women and is associated with infertility and diabetes. Poretsky‚Äôs work helped lead to the use of insulin-sensitizing agents in patients with PCOS. Poretsky and his coworkers also characterized related receptors in the ovary (insulin-like growth factor receptors, peroxisome- proliferator activated receptor-gamma), and he conceptualized an insulin- related ovarian regulatory system. AIDS/HIV Another line of Poretsky's research involved endocrine manifestations of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and includes an early review of endocrinological dysfunction in AIDS patients. Additionally, in 1987 Poretsky was a key member of the team which described a condition called hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, which is characterized by deficiency of adrenal hormone aldosterone, in patients with AIDS. This discovery resulted in introduction of treatment with fludrocortisone, which proved to be extremely effective and almost immediately converted most patients with this condition from being unable to stand (because of a severe drop in blood pressure upon standing) to being mobile and more functional. Poretsky was also key in first describing a type of inflammation of the thyroid (thyroiditis) which is caused by an opportunistic infection of the thyroid gland by an organism which had been known to infect only the lungs of patients with AIDS. He also studied the metabolism of adrenal hormones cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clinical studies in diabetes Poretsky‚Äôs other publications address a variety of subjects in diabetes and reproduction. Recent publications include an invited editorial in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in metabolic disease; a study of the potential new treatment for prevention of diabetic nephropathy (carried out in collaboration with investigators from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine); a review of the role of Vitamin D in human reproduction; and an editorial on the problem of recurrent hospitalizations of patients with diabetes.

Cadbury UK Ltd [2012] EWHC 2637 (Ch) (1 October 2012). is a trademark law case decision by the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery, in the United Kingdom. The Court held that a specific shade of the colour purple (Pantone 2685C) was registrable as a trademark for the following goods: milk chocolate in bar and tablet form; milk chocolate for eating; drinking chocolate; preparations for making drinking chocolate. However the ruling was overturned by a court of appeal in October 2014.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk- purple-trademark-blocked Background Cadbury had applied trademark registration for the colour purple (Pantone 2685C) based on filed evidence of distinctiveness acquired through use of the mark; the application was accepted and published on 30 May 2008. Nestl√© opposed the application arguing that the mark was not capable of being represented graphically and as such is not registrable as a trademark. Nestl√© also argued that the description of goods was too broad. Decision The Court stated that Sections 1(1)(a) and 3(1) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 Trade Marks Act 1994 Trade Marks Act 1994 c. 26, ¬ß¬ß 1(1)(a), 3(1) (Eng.). were intended to implement Articles 2 and 3 of the Trade Mark Directive Trade Marks Directive Directive 2008/95/EC which also correspond to Art. 4 and 7 of the Community Trade Mark Regulation.Council Regulation (EC) No. 207/2009 Therefore, the Court relied on a series of judgments from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The judge concluded ultimately in Cadbury's favour: > Since single colours per se are, as a matter of European law, capable of > being signs within Art. 2 ... then, to paraphrase a little the words Cadbury > have used in the description of the mark, in my judgment the colour purple > (Pantone 2685C) applied to the whole visible surface, or being the > predominant colour applied to the whole visible surface, of the packaging of > chocolate, is capable of being a sign within Art. 2. [...] Since on the > evidence the public associate the colour purple itself with Cadbury's > chocolate, Cadbury are entitled to a registered trade mark for that colour > on the relevant goods and that is the mark they have applied for.

Manchu folk religion is the ethnic religion practiced by most of the Manchu people, the major-Tungusic group, in China. It can also be called Manchu shamanism by virtue of the word \\"shaman\\" being originally from Tungusic ≈°am√°n (\\"man of knowledge\\"), later applied by Western scholars to similar religious practices in other cultures. It is an animistic and polytheistic religion, believing in several gods and spirits, led by a universal sky god called Abka Enduri (\\"God of Heaven\\"), also referred to as Abka Han (\\"Khan of Heaven\\") and Abka Ama (\\"Sky Father\\"), originally Abka Hehe (\\"Sky Woman\\") who is the source of all life and creation. Deities (enduri) enliven every aspect of nature, and the worship of these gods is believed to bring favour, health and prosperity. Many of the deities were originally Manchu ancestors, and people with the same surname are generated by the same god. Shamans are persons of unusual ability, strength and sensitivity, capable of perception and prediction of the ways of the gods. They are endowed with the social function to conduct the sacrificial ceremonies and approach the deities asking them intervention or protection. Because of their abilities the shamans are people of great authority and prestige. Usually, every Manchu kin has its own shaman. Manchu folk religious rites were standardised by the Qianlong Emperor (1736‚Äì96) in the \\"Manchu Sacrificial Ritual to the Gods and Heaven\\" (Manjusai wecere metere kooli bithe), a manual published in Manchu in 1747 and in Chinese (Manzhou jishen jitian dianli) in 1780. With the conquest of imperial power in China (Qing dynasty) the Manchu people gradually adopted Chinese language and assimilated into the Chinese religion, although Manchu folk religion persists with a distinct character within broader Chinese religion. History Rituals Study of Manchu religion usually distinguishes two types of ritual, \\"domestic\\" and \\"primitive\\", which can be performed in two cultic settings, \\"imperial\\" and \\"common\\". The domestic ritual primarily involves the sacrifices for the progenitors of lineages and is the most important, while the primitive ritual involves the sacrifices for zoomorphic gods. The ritual manual of Qianlong was an attempt to adapt all kins' ritual traditions to the style of the imperial kin's ritual tradition. This was only partially effective as common cults were preserved and revitalised over time. The ancestral ritual is the same in the common and imperial cults. It is composed of three main moments: the dawn sacrifice (Chinese: chaoji), the sunset sacrifice (xiji) and the \\"light-extinguishing\\" sacrifice (beidingji) held at midnight. Both common and imperial rituals make use of the gods' pole (Chinese: sh√©ngƒÅn or sh√©nzh√π, Manchu: ≈°omo) as a means of establishing connection with Heaven. While the domestic ritual is bright and harmonious, the primitive or \\"wild\\" ritual is associated with darkness and mystery. Deities involved are not those of the sky, the earth or the ancestors, but are zoomorphic chthonic deities. With its reliance on techniques of ecstasy, the primitive ritual had long been discouraged by the court (Hong Taiji proscribed it as early as 1636). Temples and gods Manchu religious cults originally took place in shrines called tangse (Chinese: t√°ngzi, \\"hall\\"; or y√®mi√†o, \\"visitation temple\\")) but at least by 1673 all communal tangse were prohibited with the exception of the imperial cult building. Households continued their rituals at private altars called weceku. Common cults gradually adopted deities from Chinese religion in addition to Tungusic gods. Guwan mafa ( GuƒÅnd√¨, Divus Guan), whose martial character appealed to the Manchus, became one of the most beloved deities. Another popular cult was that of the Goddess ( Ni√°ngni√°ng).

The experience reinforced Darwin's view that human beings were \\"created from animals\\". He wrote in his notebook that after meeting an animal like Jenny, no man could \\"boast of his proud preeminence\\". Early life Jenny arrived at London Zoo from Borneo in November 1837, after being sold by a returning sailor called Mr Moss for ¬£150. She was three years old at the time and the first orangutan to be shown at the zoo, where she was placed in a heated giraffe house. She wore human clothing and learned to drink tea.

Meeting with Charles Darwin On 28 March 1838, two years after returning from his world tour on the Beagle and more than 20 years before he presented his theory of evolution, Charles Darwin paid a visit to London Zoo and saw Jenny, which was the first time he had seen a non-human ape. In 1837 he had begun a series of notebooks in which he theorised about human evolution.Darwin Papers & Manuscripts. Retrieved from Darwin Online 2 April 2020. He wrote to his sister about Jenny in 1838: > the keeper showed her an apple, but would not give it her, whereupon she > threw herself on her back, kicked & cried, precisely like a naughty child.‚Äî > She then looked very sulky & after two or three fits of pashion, the keeper > said, \\"Jenny if you will stop bawling & be a good girl, I will give you the > apple.\\"‚Äî She certainly understood every word of this, &, though like a > child, she had great work to stop whining, she at last succeeded, & then got > the apple, with which she jumped into an arm chair & began eating it, with > the most contented countenance imaginable. Jenny's reaction reminded Darwin of the behaviour of children, and he noted that she showed facial expressions of \\"rage, sulkiness and despair\\". He made further visits to Jenny in September and October of that year and felt certain that she understood what he said. His notes also reveal that Jenny could obey instructions such as being asked to open a door, position herself ready for grooming and giving some things up. He noted her jealousy of others and that she had particularly bonded with two zookeepers. When Darwin studied Jenny's response to looking at her own reflection in a mirror, he noted that she was \\"astonished beyond measure\\". Darwin wrote in his notes that Jenny \\"looked at it every way, sideways, & with most steady surprise. After some time stuck out lips, like kissing, to glass\\", \\"put hand behind glass at various distances, looked over it, rubbed front of glass, made faces at it\\", \\"examined whole glass\\", \\"look at it startled & seemed almost frightened, & evidently became cross because it could not understand puzzle\\", and \\"put body in all kinds of positions when approaching glass to examine it\\". For Darwin, the visits to Jenny with her human-like emotions reinforced his view that human beings were \\"created from animals\\". He wrote in his notebook C:Notebook C, Charles Darwin, 1838.

Darwin's notes on Jenny are kept at the Darwin Archive at Cambridge University Library. There is no evidence that any of Jenny's skeleton or skin were preserved. After Jenny's death, she was replaced by another female orangutan who, by tradition, was also named Jenny. The second Jenny was visited by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The scene of Darwin entering Jenny's cage was re-created in the film Creation (2009), with Paul Bettany playing Darwin.

Hari Rao's accession to the throne (gaddi) was the result of a popular uprising against the adoption and crowning of the child Marthand Rao Holkar by Krishna Bai Holkar, the mother of the deceased Maharaja Malhar Rao Holkar II. In 1819, Hari Rao was involved in a power struggle with members of the royal family and was imprisoned at Maheshwar for leading an insurrection. After the crowning of Marthand Rao in January 1834, Hari was freed by supporters, who then convinced Krishna Bai to agree to his succession instead. He was subsequently adopted by the widow of the deceased Maharaja on 18 March and formally installed on the throne on 17 April 1834 at the Juna Rajwada Palace. The British Government remained neutral regarding these succession struggles. Later, however, as Hari Rao's health deteriorated, the British Resident pressed him to appoint an heir.

KG is a German manufacturer of leisure products for caravans and motorhomes. The company develops, manufactures and sells heating and air conditioning systems, hot water boilers, maneuvering systems and products for energy and gas supply. Truma was founded in 1949 in Munich, Germany. Today the headquarters is located in Putzbrunn near Munich and the company operates worldwide sales offices. Since the introduction of the first Truma heater in 1961 the company remained the market leader for LPG air heaters for recreational vehicles in Europe. Truma founder Philipp Kreis The first Truma caravan heater Modern Truma company building in Putzbrunn near Munich. Truma Combi heater and digital control panel CP plus iNet ready. The Truma iNet Box is the smart interface that allows you to control your Truma appliances with the App. History 1949 Truma was founded in 1949 by Philipp Kreis who after returning from World War II initially ran a language school for English in Munich. The unreliable power supply in the postwar period with constant power cuts was a major problem for the night school. Philipp Kreis used the functioning gas pipelines and developed gas lamps, which brightly illuminated the school even during power outages. Quickly, the school turned into a company for the production of gas lights. Philip Kreis named his company Truma in reference to the former U.S. President Harry S. Truman, whom he admired for his efforts for the reconstruction of Germany after the war. 1955-1982 In 1955 Truma released the first quick-acting valve to shut off to the gas lines. The gas lamps became popular in camping and caravanning, and Philip Kreis decided to enter this market with other products. In 1961, the Truma-matic hit the market, the first officially recognized caravan heater that worked independently from the power supply on the basis of LPG. In 1969 Truma started with the gas pressure regulator Duomatic. In 1975, the electrical controlled Trumatic E was introduced, which could also be installed in mobile homes, boats, and trucks. 1976 Truma allowed hot water supply in caravans and motorhomes by introducing the Truma Therme. The development of a gas boiler with up to 14 liters five years later made showering in a caravan possible. 1983-2003 In 1983 the company moved into new buildings next to the site of production in Putzbrunn, located just a few kilometers out of Munich. 1988 Philipp Kreis resigned from the operative business and handed over to his daughter Renate Schimmer-Wottrich. Truma developed in 1994 the Trumatic C, which offered heating and hot water from a single device. Many motorhome manufacturers took it immediately into production. In 1997 a Truma subsidiary for sales and service was established in UK. In 1999 Truma released the first maneuvering system for caravans and an air-conditioning systems for caravans and RVs. 2004-2010 In 2004 Truma opened a Service Centre. One year later, the technology and innovation center was built containing two huge climate testing chambers where equipment and vehicles of OEMs or journalists can be tested under practical conditions. In 2007 Truma ItaliaSrl was founded. 2008 a representative office in China was established. In the same year, Renate Schimmer-Wottrich resigned from the Managing Board and became chairman of the newly formed Advisory Board. 2010 Truma releases AquaStar to the market. 2011-2014 In 2011, the company owner established Truma's Renate Schimmer-Wottrich Foundation to promote projects with a focus on helping children, young adults and families. That same year, Truma entered the segment for roof-mounted air conditioning systems for recreational vehicles with the Aventa comfort. In 2012, Truma celebrated 50 years of caravan heating with two new S heater models and also introduced a fuel cell to the market. The VeGA generates electricity from LPG, which enables an energy supply independent of a network. In 2013, the company closed Truma Electronic Systems (formerly Calira) in Kaufbeuren and removed electricity generation products from its range. AquaStar has not been available since 2013 either. A year later, Truma also halted production of the VeGA fuel cell because it was unable to sell significant quantities. As part of its internationalisation, Truma established two subsidiaries ‚Äì one in the USA and one in China. Truma introduced AquaGo for the North American market. At the touch of a button, the instant water heater produces an endless flow of hot water at a constant temperature. 2015 to today In 2015, the company laid the foundations for digital networking in recreational vehicles with the Truma iNet System, which enables Truma heaters and air conditioning systems to be controlled remotely with a smartphone or tablet via the Truma App. That same year, Alexander Wottrich came on board as Managing Director of the Truma Group to manage the family-owned company in the third generation. As deputy managing director, Renate Schimmer-Wottrich supports her son in his work and remains Chair of the Advisory Board. The continuous development of new technologies was honoured in 2013, 2015 and 2017, when Truma received the \\"Top 100\\" award as one of the most innovative SMEs in Germany. On 1 January 2018 Alexander Wottrich additionally took over the position of Technical CEO which means he will be heading Research & Development and Supply Chain Management. In the same year Truma receives the Top Job award, making it one of the best employers in German SMEs.

Galotti famously left Cond√® Nast to found Talk Magazine with legendary editor Tina Brown, where he was president of the company. Talk became a symbol of old school excess and failed less than a year after its launch. The company was backed by Harvey Weinstein, who reportedly invested 50 million dollars of personal capital. After Talk folded, Galotti returned to Cond√® Nast to run GQ for about two years before retiring to Vermont. Background The Bronx-born Galotti was raised in Peekskill, Westchester County, New York. His parents ran a liquor store. Young Ron raised chickens and earned a five-year 4-H pin from the Yorktown Grange. His only known sibling was a sister (born with Down syndrome) who is now deceased. Galotti's father died when Ron was nine years old. After barely managing to graduate from high school, he enrolled in the Air Force, at the height of the Vietnam War. He was stationed for more than 3 years in the Philippines, rising to the rank of sergeant. He earned income by loan-sharking and later opened a brothel with the usury proceeds.  Response to PETA protest  While at Vogue, he and his editor in chief, Anna Wintour, once retaliated against an anti-fur protest by PETA outside the Cond√© Nast offices during the company's annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.  Relocation  After his last magazine position at GQ, Galotti sold his homes in Manhattan and Long Island, and relocated, around 1999, with his family to a farm in North Pomfret, Vermont.  Inspiration for \\"Mr. Big\\"  He is generally considered to be, and has been cited by New York magazine as, the real-life inspiration for the character of \\"Mr. Big\\" (played by actor Chris Noth) on HBO's Sex and the City (based on the books of the same name by Candace Bushnell).Galotti profile, New York MagazineGalotti profile, New York Magazine, February 12, 2001.

Kennedy who served as United States Ambassador to Ireland from 1961 to 1962. Early years Born Edward Grant Stockdale in 1915, he was an Episcopalian from Greenville, Mississippi. He attended the University of Miami, was voted President of his freshman class,IBIS, Vol. XIII, 1939, University of Miami yearbook, page 168. was reelected President of his sophomore class,The Miami Hurricane, Official Student Newspaper of the University of Miami, April 14, 1938, page 1. served as President, Phi Alpha fraternity,The Miami Hurricane, Official Student Newspaper of the University of Miami, May 5, 1938, page 2. and was the first University of Miami graduate to become a United States Ambassador.The Miami Hurricane, Official Student Newspaper of the University of Miami, March 24, 1961, page 1. He played varsity football in 1938 and 1939, and graduated with a degree in Business Administration. He worked as a salesman and then as a manager for a venetian blind company. He then worked in real estate and was elected President of the Miami Junior Chamber of Commerce. During World War II he served in the U.S. Marine Corps in the Pacific. He left the service as a 1st Lieutenant and remained a Major in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves. Career Stockdale was a Democrat and friend of George Smathers, whom he helped elect to Congress in 1946. Stockdale became Smathers' administrative assistant briefly and served in the Florida Legislature from 1948 to 1949. While serving in the Florida House of Representatives, he introduced the Women's Jury Bill to provide for jury service by women, reluctantly accepted an amendment that instead allowed women to register for jury service, and secured the bill's passage by persuading the governor to withdraw his veto of the legislation. He also introduced the first anti-Ku Klux Klan legislation in a southern state, designed to prohibit the wearing of masks and hoods in public. He reported receiving anonymous telephone calls telling him \\"leave this thing alone or you'll be sorry.\\" He rejected support for the bill offered by the Communist-dominated Miami Civil Rights Congress. He also secured House passage of a Birth Secrecy Bill that made the birth certificates of illegitimate children confidential. He also led a successful campaign against a tax on hotels and rooming houses and supported legislation to increase criminal penalties for child molestation. He lost the Democratic primary for his House seat in May 1950 to Dante Fascell. Through Smathers, Stockdale met John F. Kennedy, a young Congressman, in 1949. Stockdale served on the Dade County Commission from 1952 to 1956. He staged a one-man revolt in September 1954 by making an issue of the Commission's practice of conducting closed-door meetings and requiring unanimous votes. In 1955 he proposed the development of a convention hall to bring national conventions and sporting events to Miami and Miami Beach and a variety of other projects. Stockdale later worked in real estate in Miami. President Kennedy visited him in Florida frequently before becoming president. In 1959 and 1960 Stockdale headed the Florida State committee to elect John F. Kennedy president. When Smathers decided to go to the 1960 Democratic National Convention as the favorite son candidate of the Florida delegation, part of an effort aimed at securing the nomination for Kennedy, he urged Stockdale to join the delegation: \\"[I]t would appear to me that the best way you can be helpful to Jack Kennedy is to come on out with us ... where the fight will be held. You can't do him any good at home ... you must be where your voice can be heard and your presence felt.\\" Stockdale campaigned for him in West Virginia, Oregon, and New York, and he was a member of the Democratic Party National Finance Committee. Ambassador to Ireland Stockdale (far left) with Kennedy and other ambassadors in March 1961 At the start of the Kennedy administration, Newsweek magazine described Stockdale as \\"an ardent New Frontiersman and sometime participant in Kennedy touch-football games\\".Newsweek, vol. 57 (1961), p. 36 Kennedy nominated Stockdale to serve as Ambassador to Ireland in February 1961. Time magazine criticized Kennedy for nominating Stockdale after promising during the campaign to appoint ambassadors on the basis of ability alone. It asked \\"where reward stopped and ability began\\". The Senate confirmed the appointment on March 28, 1961. In April, 1961, just before leaving for Ireland, Stockdale was sued by a business rival that claimed he had used \\"undue influence\\" to win government contracts for a Miami vending machines company in which he held stock. The Dade County Circuit Court dismissed that suit as \\"frivolous\\" and the Florida Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that dismissal. Congress later investigated those vending machine companies as part of the Bobby Baker scandal investigations into bribery of members of Congress, though Stockdale was not a target of the investigation. When interviewed by the Miami Herald during the Baker investigation, Stockdale said: \\"I am a business man, but I still consider myself a quasi-public figure. I am very meticulous in my dealings.\\" Stockdale presented his credentials in Dublin on May 17, 1961, and served until July 7, 1962. Return to private life After his time as ambassador, Stockdale returned to real estate and worked in public relations for the American Canteen Company. He also maintained his friendship with Kennedy. On January 1, 1963, Stockdale sat with Kennedy to watch the Orange Bowl game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Oklahoma Sooners, for which the President performed the opening coin toss. Stockdale was invited by Kennedy to participate in the May 30, 1963, Memorial Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery, as the President laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Following the ceremonies, Kennedy and Stockdale visited the grave of Lieutenant James Forrestal, first United States Secretary of Defense and former Secretary of the Navy. On November 25, 1963, Stockdale attended the funeral of President Kennedy at the invitation of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. Personal life and death In 1954, Stockdale was named a member of Iron Arrow, an honorary organization of University of Miami graduates. He also served terms as president of the University of Miami Alumni Association and the Miami Jaycees. He was married to the poet Alice Boyd Stockdale, n√©e Magruder. He had 2 sons and 3 daughters. Stockdale died in a fall from his office on the 13th floor of the DuPont Building in Miami, Florida, on December 2, 1963, one week after the funeral and just ten days after the assassination of President Kennedy. Police termed it a suicide, but no suicide note was found. Larry King later reported speaking to him the day of the assassination and finding him \\"disconsolate to the point where he couldn't get a word out\\". Alice Boyd Stockdale's book of poetry, To Ireland, with Love, was published by Doubleday & Company in 1964 and dedicated to her husband: \\"For Grant with whom, hand in hand, I walked through Phoenix Park ... and who will always walk with me.\\" President Kennedy had urged her to publish her poems.

The book is an account of change and transformation in modern India. It was selected by The New Yorker and The New Republic as a Best Book of 2012, and Newsweek as one of its three Must Reads on Modern India. Brief Summary India Becoming, by the Harvard University trained social anthropologist, Akash Kapur, is an in-depth study of simple average people from a nondescript town in South India, their mundane life and their struggle to survive the vicissitudes of the burgeoning society that modernization has thrown their way. In this debut attempt, Kapur chose to go to such great lengths to depict the real-life stories and experiences of people that it took him five years to finish the book. Kapur, in this critically acclaimed book, also expresses his unbiased sentiments about the outcomes rapid urbanization brings in its wake, affecting people from all social strata, both the country and the bustling metropolis, be it his rural hometown in Tamil Nadu or the chaotic cities of Bombay, Bangalore or Chennai. The real-life characters in his book successfully reflect the writer's views in graphic detail. Born to an Indian father and American mother, Kapur's early life was spent in India. He left for US when he was 16 and started his academic years there. He came back to India in 2003 to settle down permanently. \\"I was coming home, but in many ways, it was to a home I didn't recognize anymore\\" says the one-time \\"Letter From India\\" columnist for the International Herald Tribune and the New York Times. A book of hybrid nonfiction, India Becoming presents an imagined geography of 2010s Delhi and India as experienced and created by an Indian returnee migrant author. As Mendes and Lau argue, Kapur's text reflects \\"some of the enduring key themes involved in the reinvention and restoration of imagined geographies, such as assimilation vs alienation/anomie and tradition vs modernity.\\" To quote an excerpt from his book: \\"Einstein once wrote of America that its people were \\"always becoming, never being\\", but it was in India now that I felt that sense of newness, of perpetual reinvention and forward momentum that I had felt when I first moved to America\\".

Early life and education William Henry Beach, universally known as Bill Beach, was the son of the late Canon W R Beach, Chaplain to the forces, and Sophia J. Watson, daughter of Dr. Thomas Watson, a well-known physician of Macao and Hong Kong. He was born on 7 June 1871 at 5 Belfast Terrace, Dublin, the younger brother of Thomas Boswall Beach. He was educated at Bloxham School, Wolverhampton Grammar School and the Royal Military Academy Woolwich.Elise S. Beach 'Notes on the Beach Family' , Reading 1919, A manuscript note reproduced in David Evans 'Hugh Beach: a Memoir‚Äô published privately, London 2003, pp.149,150. Military career Beach was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1889 and served in Chatham (1890) Shorncliffe (1891), the Curragh (1892‚Äì94) and Cairo (1894). In 1895 he was posted to India where he was to spend most of his service. From 1895 to 1898 he served in the Central Public Works Department (Military Works Service and Irrigation Branch) where his activities included constructing a section of the Lower Ganges Canal, as the only European in charge of many hundred Indians. In 1899 he was transferred to the Bengal Sappers and Miners and was promoted captain in 1900. He commanded successively the 6th and 5th Field Companies mainly at Roorkee and, in 1901, worked on the Khushalgarh Kohat Thal (KKT) railway. In 1905 he left the Sappers and Miners to pursue a career on the general staff, serving successively with the Meerut Cavalry Brigade and the Dehra Dun Infantry Brigade.J.R.E. Charles, Obituary in The Royal Engineers Journal, Volume LXVI, December 1952, pp. 395,6. In April and May 1908 the British mounted a punitive expedition against the Mohmand tribes on the North West Frontier where he saw his first active service as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General to the 3rd Brigade.Peter Duckers, 'North West Frontier 1908: The Zaka Khel and Mohmand Campaigns, Spink, London 2006, pp. 45, 63. He was promoted major in 1909 and served for the next two years on the staff of the 7th Meerut Division. In 1912 he joined the staff of Lieutenant-General Sir John Nixon (Commanding the Southern Army) as Assistant Military Secretary. In April 1915 Nixon took command of Indian Expeditionary Force D, whose task was to invade Mesopotamia (now Iraq), then part of the Ottoman Empire. Beach went with him as head of the Military Intelligence Branch. The Mesopotamian campaign began well, with the rapid advance of a division under Major General Townshend up the Tigris River, with a view to capturing Baghdad. In late November 1915 this advance was halted at the Battle of Ctesiphon, 25 miles south of Baghdad. During this battle Beach received a gunshot wound, the bullet going through his arm and narrowly missing his heart after being deflected by his cigarette case. Townshend withdrew his force in good order to the town of Kut-al-Amara, which he fortified. The Turkish army followed up and, on 7 December, laid siege to the town. It soon became clear that the garrison of Kut, while defensible, could not be re-supplied. The limited air drops available were insufficient. Four successive attempts to break the siege of Kut all failed. On 24 April 1916 an effort by the paddle steamer 'Julnar' to resupply the garrison by river also failed. Food was running out and disease was spreading rapidly. On 29 April, Beach, together with T E Lawrence (later to become known as 'Lawrence of Arabia') and Aubrey Herbert went through the Turkish lines under a white flag, insisting upon an interview with the Turkish commander Halil Kut (Khalil Pasha).Aubrey Herbert, 'Mons Anzac and Kut: a British Intelligence Officer in Three Theatres of the First World War, 1914‚Äì18 ‚Äô, reprinted LEONAUR 2010. Entry for Sunday 30 April 1916. Ostensibly seeking to arrange exchanges of wounded and prisoners, Beach had secret permission from London to offer Khalil a bribe. This was brushed aside. The mission failed and on the same day Townshend surrendered. Over 13,000 soldiers became prisoners of war, a major defeat for the British. Nearly all the British commanders involved were removed from their jobs but Beach survived with his reputation unscathed. Nixon, in a despatch, had written of him: ‚ÄòAs head of the Intelligence Branch he has shown exceptional powers of insight and organisation.‚ÄôJ.E.Nixon, Despatch, 17 January 1916, The London Gazette, 29576, (10 May 1916) p.4661. T E Lawrence, in a report dated May 1916, while deploring that the Intelligence Branch contained no Turkish speakers and only one who knew Arabic, commented that ‚Äò(Beach) is very excellent.‚ÄôT.E.Lawrence, ‚ÄòIntelligence IEF ‚ÄúD‚Äù May 1916, cited in J.Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T.E.Lawrence (London 1989), p. 959. Brigadier General Beach (back row, 3rd from right) with British and Russian officers and men The remainder of 1916 was spent in reinforcing the British forces and setting up much improved lines of supply. The new commander, General Maude, began an offensive in December 1916 and by March 1917 had captured Baghdad. Further operations took place in the spring of 1918 and again in the autumn culminating in the surrender of Halil with his army, followed by the capture of Mosul on 14 November 1918. During this time the Intelligence Branch was greatly expanded.The National Archive, WO 157/806, (Mesopotamia GHQ Intelligence Summary, December 1917); WO 157/816 (Mesopotamia GHQ Intelligence Summary, October 1918). Beach remained at its head and was promoted successively to lieutenant colonel in January 1916, colonel later that year and brigadier general in January 1917. When the Ottoman empire capitulated to the Allies in October 1918, they agreed to withdraw all their troops from the Caucasus, leaving Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia as three emergent states, independent of both Russia and Turkey. The British immediately sent a Military Mission to the Caucasus under General George Milne, involving a division of British and Indian troops. They were to secure the withdrawal of the Turkish army, and safeguard the railway and the oil pipeline from Baku on the Caspian to Batum on the Black Sea, so becoming the predominant foreign power there. Beach was posted as head of intelligence to this Mission and wrote reports on several controversial issues including the status of Nagorno KarabakhArtie H. Arslanian 'Britain and the Question of Mountainous Karabakh' in Middle Eastern Studies, Volume 16, January 1990, pp. 95,96. and the location of the border between Georgia and Russia. But all the borders were disputed, which soon led to bloodshed, particularly between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The British had no clear policy for the region and, by the late summer of 1919, faced with a resurgent Turkey under Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the Red Army looming on the horizon and general lack of resources, Whitehall decided upon withdrawal. Most of the troops left and Beach was at last free to return to India.Thomas de Waal, 'The Caucasus: An Introduction‚Äô, 2010. In 1920 Beach became Deputy Director of Intelligence at Army Headquarters India. From 1923 to 1927 he commanded the Jubbulpore Brigade. He then reverted to England on half-pay, being promoted Major General in January 1928. From 1929 to 1932 he commanded the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division in the Territorial Army,J.R.E. Charles, Obituary in The Royal Engineers Journal, Volume LXVI, December 1952, pp. 395,6. and on 29 April 1931 he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Divisional Engineers.Army List. Later life Beach retired in 1932, moved to Camberley, Surrey, and worked on the Council of the Regular Forces Employment Association and on the Council of the Voluntary Aid Detachment. From 1936 to 1941 he was a colonel commandant of the Royal Engineers and chairman of the Royal Engineers Old Comrades Association. He died on 22 July 1952, aged 81, in Hambledon, Surrey.J.R.E. Charles, Obituary in The Royal Engineers Journal, Volume LXVI, December 1952, pp. 395,6. Family and other interests On 26 December 1914 Beach married Constance Maud, only daughter of the late Captain Archibald A Cammell, 14th Hussars, of Brookfield Manor Derbyshire in St Stephen's Church Ootacamund (Ooty). After only three months the couple were separated for over four years during Beach's service in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus. They had two children: a daughter June who was born 1921 and died the same year in India, and a son William Gerald Hugh (Hugh Beach) born on 20 May 1923 in South Kensington, London. Beach was a keen sportsman. In India he took part in polo and pigsticking. In 1913 at Ooty he won the Novices cup on his own horse. He was invited to become Master of the Ooty Hounds but time did not allow. He was also a keen shot, particularly of small game, and fisherman. He was a competent cricketer and played regimental golf with success.J.R.E. Charles, Obituary in The Royal Engineers Journal, Volume LXVI, December 1952, pp. 395,6. Beach was, above all, a very human man. His troops and subordinate officers all loved him and he had a capacity for command not enjoyed by many of his contemporaries. He knew his Indian Sappers intimately and they recognised his ability and thoroughness and, above all, his fairness and readiness to help any man in trouble. When commanding the Jubbulpore Brigade, he got to know every officer, many of the British Non-Commissioned Officers and most of the Indian officers by name. All ranks revered him, not only as a commander, but as a good friend who joined in all their sports and games. When the time came to relinquish his command the whole Brigade turned out to a man to line the railway line so that each man could give a parting cheer as the train passed him on its way towards Bombay.J.R.E. Charles, Obituary in The Royal Engineers Journal, Volume LXVI, December 1952, pp. 395,6. Honours and awards Beach was awarded the DSO in 1916, CMG in 1917 and CB in 1919. He was awarded the Serbian Order of Karageorge (4th Class) in 1916 and was seven times mentioned in despatches. He was Aide de Camp to King George V from 1922 to 1928.J.R.E.

Since the 1920s, tensions have often resulted in violence and attempted separatism, including major riots, uprising in 1979, unrest in 2005, terrorist bombings in 2005‚Äì06, protests in 2011 and the 2018 Ahvaz military parade attack, drawing much criticism of Iran by international human rights organizations. Iran denies that ethnic discrimination or conflict exist in the country. Demographic background Khuzestan is inhabited by many different ethnic groups aside from Iranian Arabs, including Bakhtiari, Qashqai people, indigenous Persians and Armenians. Most Arabs in Khuzestan are Shia Muslims. Both the urban and rural Arabs of Khuzestan are intermingled with the Persians, and Lurs who also live in the province and often intermarry with them. History Shaykh Khazal rebellion Khuzestan has been a troublesome province of Iran since the ascent of the Pahlavi rule in the 1920s. In the two decades before 1924, although officially part of Persian territory, the western part of Khuzestan functioned as an autonomous emirate known as \\"Arabistan\\". The eastern part of Khuzestan was governed by Bakhtiari khans because the eastern part of Khuzestan was mainly inhabited by Bakhtiari people. With rising power of Reza Khan and his increasingly negative attitudes on tribal autonomies in Iran, tensions with shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah had grown from 1922 to 1924. Attempts to withdraw more taxes and reduce Khazal's authority heated it up even more. In response Khaz'al al-Ka'bi initiated a rebellion. The short rebellion by Sheikh Khazal, at its peak in November 1924, was quickly crushed by the newly installed Pahlavi dynasty with minimal casualties. The emirate was dissolved by Reza Shah government in 1925, along with other autonomous regions of Persia, in a bid to centralize the state. At least 115 people died in the insurrection.Cronin, S. Tribal Politics in Iran: Rural Conflict and the New State, 1921‚Äì1941. pp52-5. A low level conflict between the central Iranian government and the Arab separatists of the western part of the province continued since. Unrests and revolts (1920s‚Äì1940s) Riots broke out as early as 1925, then in 1928 and 1940. The name Khuzistan came to be applied once again to the entire territory by 1936.Journal of Middle Eastern studies, Vol. 25, No. 3 (August 1993), pp. 541-543 In August 1941, Reza Khan was replaced by his son Muhammad. New revolts in Khuzestan under new Iranian leadership occurred in 1943 and 1945 and were quelled in blood. In 1946, the Al Saada party was founded in Muhammar and demanded the independence of Khuzestan. The Iranian army took advantage of its conflicts with the Communist Party, Toudeh, to commit massacres. Insurgency (1956-1960s) Later in Arabistan, new independent or autonomist parties came into being: the \\"Arabistan Liberation Front\\" in 1956; the \\"National Front for the Liberation of Arabistan\\" and the \\"Arab Gulf\\" in 1960; In 1967, the \\"Arabistan Liberation Front\\" became the \\"Al Ahwaz Liberation Front\\". Sporadic Arab insurgency in Khuzestan continued through the 1950s, but reduced in the final decade of Pahlavy rule (1970s). 1979 uprising With the change of regime, the 1979 Khuzestan uprising became one of the nationwide uprisings, which erupted in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution. The unrest was fed by demands for autonomy. The uprising was effectively quelled by Iranian security forces, resulting in more than a hundred people on both sides killed combined. The Iranian Embassy Siege of 1980 in London was initiated by an Arab separatist group as an aftermath response to the Iranian crackdown in Khuzestan, after the 1979 uprising. Initially, it emerged the terrorists wanted autonomy for Khuzestan; later they demanded the release of 91 of their comrades held in Iranian jails.

Initially, the Iranian Interior Ministry stated that only one person had been killed, however an official at a hospital in Ahvaz said that between 15 and 20 mortal casualties. Consequently, a series of bombings was carried out in Ahvaz and other cities in Iran in late 2005 and early 2006, blamed upon Sunni Arab separatist groups of Khuzestan. The 2011 Khuzestan protests, known among protesters as the Ahvaz Day of Rage, erupted on 15 April 2011 in Iranian Khuzestan, to mark an anniversary of the 2005 Ahvaz unrest, and as a response to the regional Arab Spring. The protests lasted for 4 days and resulted in 12 to 15 protesters killed and many wounded and arrested. 1 security officer was killed as well, and another wounded. Crackdown on Arab political opposition in the area continued since with arrests and executions. Four Ahwazi men were executed in Iran in June 2012, in relation to the 2011 unrest. The crackdown on Arab Sunni opposition has been condemned by the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, and others. In 2013, bombings were carried out in Ahvaz, reportedly made by the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz (ASMLA). On 23 March 2015, a football match discontent resulted in anti- government protests in Ahvaz. Local football fans defiantly expressed support for Saudi al-Hilal football team during the match and burnt pictures of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the late Iranian spiritual leader who spearheaded the 1979 Iranian revolution. The opposition National Council of Resistance of Iran said that fans further carried banners declaring that ‚ÄúWe are all Younes,‚Äù a reference to a street vendor, who immolated himself a few days before the match in the nearby city of Khorramshahr. In parallel, Iran's state-run Press TV has broadcast confessions of captured ASMLA members who said they had carried out scores of attacks. An Arab protester was killed by Iranian security forces during the events. On 2 April 2015, 3 Iranian officers were killed by unidentified gunmen in the city of Hamidiyeh, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) west of the city of Ahvaz.PressTV. 3 Iranian police killed in terrorist attack attack. attack Additional 2 casualties were sustained by the Iranian security on 26 October 2015.PressTV. Iran arrests perpetrators behind terrorist attack in Khuzestan. =2016= In early June 2016, a Sunni group known as Suqour al-Ahvaz (\\"Hawks of Ahvaz\\") blew up the Bou-Ali-Sina Petrochemical Complex in Bandar-E Mahshahr, Khuzestan. In July 2016, on two occasions Ahwazi militants of al-Farouq Brigade of the Ahwazi National Resistance blew up pipelines in the Johar as-Sabaa' district. Reportedly, members of the al-Farouq Brigade managed to escape after the operation, despite efforts of the security forces and Revolutionary Guards to track down the offenders. According to Algemeiner, the group responsible for the 11 and 17 July attacks was Suqour al-Ahvaz (\\"Hawks of Ahvaz\\"). In August 2016, Iran executed 3 men, charged with terror attack which led to the death of 3 Iranian policemen in Khuzestan province back in April 2015. In October 2016, a young girl was killed, when Iranian security forces attempted to arrest her father, wanted for security reasons. =2017= In early April 2017, Ahwazi activist killed by Basij militia in Ma‚Äôshour city On 15 May 2017, suspected Arab separatist gunmen killed two police officers in Ahvaz. In October 2017, Ahmad Mullah Nissi, head of the Arab Struggle Movement for Khuzestan was assassinated in the Netherlands. =2018= Massive demonstrations erupted in the Khuzestan province during April 2018, spreading from Ahwaz to several large cities of the province. 10 people were reported killed in a fire during one of those demonstrations, which was blamed on Iranian intelligence services by the protesters. On September 22, 2018, a group of terrorists opened fire on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's parade, killing 25 soldiers and civilians in Ahvaz. The Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella organization of all armed separatist movements, claimed responsibility for the terror attack. The responsibility for the attack was claimed in parallel by the Ahvaz National Resistance and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The Iranian government blamed ISIL for the attack and retaliated. =2019= =2020= Casualties Total estimate: 206-345 killed (1922-2017): *1922-1924: 115+ killed during Sheikh Khazal rebellion *1979: 25-112 killed during 1979 Khuzestan uprising *1980: 7 killed during Iranian Embassy siege in London *2005: 1-50 killed during 2005 Ahvaz unrest *2005-2006: 28+ killed in Ahvaz bombings *2011: 13-16 killed in 2011 Khuzestan protests *2012: 4 executed in response to 2011 protests by Iran *2015: 6 killed in three incidents *2016: 1 killed, 3 executed *2017: 4 killed *2018: 10-39 killed Human rights issues Minorities at Risk (MAR), a university- based research project, states in its website that Arabs in Khuzestan have experienced discrimination.MAR  Data  Assessment for Arabs in Iran While all Khuzestanis are accorded \\"full respect\\" in the Iranian constitution, in practice and through social exclusion, they suffer discrimination. Arabs face restrictions on use of and instruction in Arabic language. While the moderate regime of Khatami had put into place some remedial policies for the Arab population, these were removed under Ahmadinejad. Following mass protests in 2005 and 2006, Arabs have faced generally repressive policies placed on the entire population. Arab organizations in the conflict There are a number of Iranian Arab political parties operating in exile, but no known political party representing other ethnic groups in Iranian Khuzestan. The ideology of Arab parties varies, although most are secular in their political outlook. Ideology, tactics, tribal loyalties and personal ambition have prevented these parties from forming a united front. Some advocate armed resistance, while others believe in non-violent action. Most refer to the entire province of Khuzestan as al-Ahwaz (which only refers to a region in the southwest portion) or Arabistan, although some define Arabistan as also including territory along the Persian Gulf coast to the Strait of Hormuz. Whether these views are popular or even accepted amongst most Iranian Arabs is uncertain. Khuzestan's deputy governor Rahim Fazilatpur claimed that the Arab Martyrs of Khuzestan, the Al-Ahwaz Arab Peoples Democratic Popular Front (AADPF) and the Ahwaz Arab Renaissance Party (AARP) were given support by the British and US governments to carry out the bomb attacks of June 2005. The Arab political parties are divided into two camps: those seeking a separate state and those seeking regional autonomy within a federal Iran. Critics of these parties claim that separatism has no support among Arabs, pointing to the decision by many Iranian Arabs to defend Iran during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The support shown by Iranian Arabs may have been a result of the knowledge of Shiite Muslims in Saddam's Iraq. They also contend that separatism has always been instigated by foreign governments ‚Äì particularly the British ‚Äì to weaken Iran in order to control the country's natural resources and extend their influence over the Middle East. Many make no distinction between separatists and federalists, claiming that those seeking federalism have a separatist agenda and that the devolution of power to regional ethnic groups would lead to the break-up of Iran. Islamic Reconciliation Party The Islamic Reconciliation Party (Hezb al-Wefagh), also known as the Reconciliation Committee (Lejnat al- Wefagh), was the only known Arab group to have been tolerated by the Iranian government. Jasem Shadidzadeh Al-Tamimi was the party's secretary general. He was a member of the Sixth Majlis (2000‚Äì04), representing Ahwaz as a member of the Islamic Iran Participation Front, but was barred from standing for election in 2004. Following the unrest in Khuzestan in April 2005, Al-Tamimi wrote to the then President Khotami calling on him to remove the \\"wall of mistrust between the proud Iranian ethnicities, so that the infected wounds of the Arab people of Ahwaz may heal.\\" He added that \\"our wishful thinking about reforms in Arab affairs by the Reformists has been only a mirage\\", indicating that he no longer had faith in the Participation Front. He listed a number of grievances, including: * violence against Arab demonstrators by security forces * land confiscation * the destruction of Arab residential compounds * the high level of drug abuse among Iranian Arabs, which he claims is rooted in poverty * racial discrimination and the official view of Arabs as a security threat * the government's failure to issue activity permits for the Islamic Wefagh Party and affiliated non-governmental organisations He indicates that he opposes separatism and the ideology of \\"extreme Persian nationalism\\" he associates with the previous monarchist government. The Islamic Wefagh Party claims to have an \\"extensive\\" base of support in Khuzestan. The group was banned in November 2006 and labelled a \\"subversive organisation trying to unseat the current system by spreading racial hatred and provoking ethnic clashes.\\" At the same time, three of its leading members were arrested. Al- Ahwaz Arab Peoples Democratic Popular Front The Al-Ahwaz Arab Peoples Democratic Popular Front (AADPF) is based in London and is led by Mahmud Ahmad Al-Ahwazi, aka Abu Bashar. The group calls for human rights and democracy for Iranian Arabs and believes that Al-Ahwaz was occupied by Iran in 1925. The ADPF has a number of activists in Iranian custody. Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani, the Minister of Defense and Logistic Affairs of the Armed Forces, accused Mahmud Ahmad Al-Ahwazi of involvement in the April 2005 unrest, while simultaneously claiming that his group had \\"zero popularity\\" amongst Arabs in Khuzestan. The ADPF has also claimed it led what it calls an \\"intifada\\" in Khuzestan. Shamkhani also claimed that Mahmud Ahmad Al-Ahwazi was a former member of the SAVAK (the Shah's secret police) before the revolution who defected to Iraq during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. It is not known how much, if any, of Shamkhani's claims are true. Ahwaz Arab Renaissance Party The AARP is another separatist group advocating armed resistance to the Iranian government. It was originally set up in the 1990s by the Syrian government, but has since moved its leadership to Canada. In April 2005, it claimed on a pro-Iraqi Ba'athist website that it had exploded a bomb on the Ahwaz-Tehran pipeline. It also claimed responsibility for the June 2005 bombings in Ahwaz City. Two other groups also separately claimed responsibility for the attacks. It is led by Sabah al-Musawi, a Canadian resident. Democratic Solidarity Party of Al-Ahwaz The Democratic Solidarity Party of Al-Ahwaz (DSPA), based in the US and the UK, claiming to represent the Iranian Arabs of Khuzestan. The DSPA's ideology is different from the separatists in that it explicitly rejects the use of violence and advocates what it calls \\"internal self- determination\\". It also limits its territorial focus on Khuzestan, making no stand on Arab-populated living outside the province. The DSPA claims that Khuzestan has a historical Arab identity and this means that the province should be given autonomy within a federal political system, but it says it respects Iran's territorial integrity. To achieve its ends, it has formed a coalition with like-minded parties representing Kurds, Azeris, Baluchis, Turkmen and Lurs, some of which have been in armed conflict with the Iranian state. Formed in London in March 2005, the Congress of Nationalities for a Federal Iran (CNFI) brought together the DSPA, the Baluchistan United Front, Federal Democratic Movement of Azerbaijan, Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, Balochistan People's Party, Organization for Defense of the Rights of Turkmen People and Komalah, a militant Kurdish opposition party. Ahwaz Liberation Organisation The Ahwaz Liberation Organisation (ALO), based in Maastricht in the Netherlands, was formed out of the remnants of three Iraqi- backed groups ‚Äì the Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan (DRFLA), People's Front for Liberation of Arabistan (PFLA) and the Arab Front for the Liberation of Al-Ahwaz (AFLA). It is a secular pan-Arabist group seeking independence from Iran. The DRFLA was the most notorious, having been sponsored by Saddam Hussein. It was founded after the newly installed Islamic government fired on Arab demonstrators in Khorramshahr, killing many of them. The DRFLA was behind the May 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege in London, taking a number of hostages in an effort to draw attention to its demands for the self-determination of the Arab population of Khuzestan. The British Special Air Service (SAS) stormed the building and freed the hostages. Fowzi Badavi Nejad, the only survivor of that group, had survived only because some of the embassy hostages had put themselves between him and the SAS soldiers. Some evidences indicated the Iraqi intelligence services had duped Nejad into taking part in the siege. The evidence showed that once he knew the true nature of the group's plans, he only continued because he feared that his family, who had fled from Iran to Iraq, would suffer if he tried to withdraw the last hostage. The ALO's constituent groups operated as a mercenary force on behalf of Saddam's regime during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, carrying out assassinations and attacking oil facilities. Bomb attacks on oil and power facilities have continued since the end of the Iraq War, although the ALO has not formally claimed responsibility. The ALO's leader, the self-styled \\"President of Al-Ahwaz\\" Faleh Abdallah Al-Mansouri, was living in exile in the Netherlands since 1989, shortly after the end of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, gaining Dutch nationality. He declared himself to be the \\"President\\" of Al-Ahwaz, which he claims extends beyond Khuzestan, including much of the coast of Iran. However, during a visit to Syria in May 2006, he was arrested along with Iranian Arabs who were registered as refugees by the UNHCR.

Biography  Narvaez was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her father, Richard Narvaez, was a professor of Spanish linguistics at the University of Minnesota. Darcia Narvaez spent part of her childhood in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Colombia, and Spain. Her first job was with the local public television station (KTCA) in St. Paul, Minnesota, as a 7-and 8-year- old: she was the voice of the puppet, Maria, on the Spanish-language-teaching program Ya Hablamos Espa√±ol. Narvaez subsequently worked as a church musician (organist, choir director), classroom and private music teacher (Brent International School in Baguio City, Philippines; King of Kings School in Roseville, Minnesota), middle school Spanish teacher (The Blake School in Hopkins, Minnesota), and business owner. She also earned a master of divinity degree from Luther Seminary in St. Paul and is a published poet. Narvaez earned her PhD in educational psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1993, and joined the College of Education and Human Development there in the department of curriculum and instruction and the department of educational psychology. In 2000, she joined the department of psychology at Notre Dame. Narvaez was married to Professor James Rest until his death in 1999. She is married to Daniel Lapsley, a professor of psychology at Notre Dame.  Career  Narvaez was the design leader of the Minnesota Community Voices and Character Education project funded with $1 million by the US Department of Education during 1998-2002. She is co-author with James Rest, Steve Thoma and Muriel Bebeau of the book Postconventional Moral Thinking (1999). Narvaez was one of five psychologists to be invited to speak at the White House's Conference on Character in Community in 2002. Narvaez's work emphasizes moral development over the lifespan, and the interaction between implicit and explicit processes in moral functioning.Narvaez, D. (2010).\\"Moral complexity: The fatal attraction of truthiness and the importance of mature moral functioning.\\" Perspectives on Psychological Science, 5(2), 163-181. She emphasizes the importance of early experience in shaping moral capacities.Narvaez, D. (2008). \\"Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities.\\" New Ideas in Psychology, 26, 95-119. Her current work is on the evolved developmental niche for young children (natural birth, extensive on-demand breastfeeding, constant touch, caregiver responsiveness, free play, multiple adult caregivers and extensive positive social support).. Narvaez, D., Panksepp, J., Schore, A., & Gleason, T. (Eds.) (2013). Evolution, Early Experience and Human Development: From Research to Practice and Policy. New York: Oxford University Press. She is studying the effects of early life experience on moral development in the US and in China.Narvaez, D., Wang, L., Gleason, T., Cheng, A., Lefever, J., & Deng, L. (2013). \\"The Evolved Developmental Niche and sociomoral outcomes in Chinese three-year-olds.\\" European Journal of Developmental Psychology, 10(2), 106-127. A recent emphasis in Narvaez's work involves indigenous wisdom, starting with her 2013 paper \\"The 99%--Development and socialization within an evolutionary context: Growing up to become 'A good and useful human being.'‚Äù She organized a conference in September 2016 called \\"Sustainable Wisdom: Integrating Indigenous Knowhow for Global Flourishing\\" resulting in the volume, Indigenous Sustainable Wisdom (2019). Narvaez's blog, \\"Moral Landscapes,\\" at Psychology Today has over 14 million hits (as of mid 2020) with the most popular posts being \\"Dangers of 'Crying it Out'\\" with over 2.8 million hits, Five Things NOT to do to Babies, and Myths about Circumcision You Likely Believe.  Honors  Narvaez is a fellow of the American Psychological Association and of the American Educational Research Association. She is former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Moral Education. Narvaez's book Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom won the 2015 William James Book Award from Division I of the American Psychological Association. It also won the 2017 Expanded Reason Award.http://www.expandedreasonawards.org/expanded-reasons-awards/news/the- expanded-reason-awards-winners-have-been-selected_242_71_252_0_1_in.html Several of Narvaez's books have won awards from the special interest group, Moral Development and Education, at the American Educational Research Association: *Postconventional Moral Thinking (2000 (which also won the book award from AERA Division I); *Moral Development, Self and Identity (2007); *Handbook of Moral and Character Education (2009); *Personality, Character and Identity: Explorations in Moral Psychology (2011); *Neurobiology and the Development of Human Morality: Evolution, Culture and Wisdom (2016).

It is the fifth Forza Motorsport and sixth overall installment in the Forza series. Gameplay Forza Motorsport 5 features both fictional and real-world tracks. Here the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta races at Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. The game ships with 200 cars from over 50 manufacturers and 17 circuits including Spa, Bathurst, Yas Marina, and Circuit de la Sarthe. There are monthly car packs, including 10 cars each available to buy as downloadable content (DLC) for the first 8 months after the game's launch. The possibility of tracks, such as N√ºrburgring, being available to purchase as DLC after the game's launch was considered, but instead Turn 10 Studios has released new tracks as free content for users, including Road America in February 2014, Long Beach in April 2014 and the N√ºrburgring in June 2014.Silverstone Circuit and the fictional Swiss Alps racetrack were carried over from Forza 4. At E3 2013, first-hand gameplay, new features, and cars in \\"Forza Vista\\" mode were shown. Also at the event, it was revealed that for the first time in the game's history there would be open- wheel cars including the Dallara DW12 IndyCar and Formula One cars, including the McLaren M23 driven by James Hunt and the Ferrari 312T2 driven by Niki Lauda in the 1976 Formula One season. The Lotus E21 driven by Kimi R√§ikk√∂nen and Romain Grosjean in the 2013 Formula One Season was also revealed on November 5. Soundtrack In contrast to its predecessors, there are no licensed songs from popular artists that play while racing, instead substituting them for the original score by Lance Hayes and John Broomhall. Also, in contrast with Forza Motorsport 4 and Forza Motorsport 3, the score features an emphasis on orchestration and percussion, in addition to the ambient electronica sound established in previous entries. The soundtrack was released alongside the game itself on November 22, 2013, exclusively as a digital download. Reception Forza Motorsport 5 received generally positive reviews, with aggregate review websites GameRankings and Metacritic giving a score of 79.49% and 79 out of 100, respectively. Shaun McInnis of GameSpot said the game was \\"built on the romantic thrill of motorsport in all its forms, and that love for its subject matter is all but impossible to resist.\\" Luke Reilly of IGN called it \\"an essential destination for the automobile obsessed\\" and \\"a very hard game for a revhead like myself not to love.\\" In his review for Polygon, Arthur Gies praised the game's \\"aggressive, convincing AI\\", saying it made \\"every offline race feel like a multiplayer competition\\". Gies went on to say that \\"Turn 10 has charted a course for the future of the series ‚Äî and created the Xbox One's first must-own game\\". However, a number of critics complained about the relative lack of content versus its predecessor, Forza Motorsport 4. Edge noted that the game \\"has lost some 300 cars, over 20 locations and countless tracks\\", losing \\"the variety of racing that made it great\\" and that it was \\"a launch game with all the spectacle and disappointment we‚Äôve come to expect from launch games\\". Matthew Kato of Game Informer called the game's revised career mode \\"a mistake\\" and that Forza Motorsport 5 \\"takes a big step forward only to be held back by what it has removed\\". Writing for EGM, Ray Carsillo said that while the game \\"maintains the tradition of providing great control along with some stunningly realistic graphics\\", ultimately it was \\"a surprising step backward for the Forza franchise\\". On February 18, 2014 Microsoft announced that Forza Motorsport 5 is the fastest-selling racing game in Xbox history. More than one third of Xbox One owners have bought the game. Eurogamer estimated the sales to be around 1.3 million copies. On June 16, 2014 Forza Creative Director Dan Greenawalt announced that half of all Xbox One owners have played the full version of Forza Motorsport 5.

Gameplay The first gameplay for the game was shown at the Xbox One reveal event in a trailer by EA Sports, showing off the new IGNITE game engine. The game was released on November 19, 2013. Reception NBA Live 14 received generally unfavorable reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. IGN gave the game a 4.3/10 with reviewer Jec Julio saying that \\"NBA Lives flaccid return is made all the more disappointing because we waited three years for it. After all that time, NBA Live 14 in no way advances the basketball sim genre and, worse, leaves little to be optimistic about for next year.\\" However, he did say that the Big Moments and the Ultimate Team modes were a positive. GamesRadar gave it a 2.5/5, comparing it to NBA 2K14 with reviewer Richard Grisham saying \\"The on- court gameplay doesn't look very next-gen-like, especially when compared to its NBA 2K14 counterpart.\\" While he praised the controls in 5-On-5, the Pick- and-Roll mechanic and the ESPN presentation, he critiqued the animations and physics, the glitches, and that the Rising Star mode wasn't fully built yet. Gamespot gave the game a 4/10, writing: \\"The on-court action is so sloppy and unsatisfying that even rubbing defeat in Carmelo Anthony's face loses its appeal.

Synopsis #The Leadership Ambition Gap: What Would You Do If You Weren't Afraid? ‚Äì Anecdotes are given in which Judith Rodin questions why highly talented women choose to leave careers and become homemakers and Gayle Tzemach Lemmon gives her opinion that a double standard makes ambition be perceived as a negative quality in a woman when it would be positive in a man. #Sit at the Table ‚Äì Anecdotes are given about Peggy McIntosh stating that women are pressured not to accept compliments about their accomplishments, Padmasree Warrior stating that people should consider taking opportunities even if they do not feel qualified to execute them, and Ginni Rometty discussing how she took risks even staking personal failure. Also discussed is the theory that females more frequently than males display impostor syndrome concerns, and the concept of \\"fake it till you make it\\". #Success and Likeability ‚Äì A social experiment is summarized in which two resumes stating business success are presented to various people. The resumes are identical except that one names a female job candidate and the other a male candidate. In most cases, people found the success of the male candidate to be appealing and the success of the female candidate to be worrisome. Anecdotes are given in which Mary Sue Coleman states that in negotiation women in business are often \\"relentlessly pleasant\\" and Arianna Huffington acknowledged that she had to accept a lot of criticism. #It's a Jungle Gym, Not a Ladder ‚Äì A discussion reconsiders the concept of the \\"corporate ladder\\" suggesting that the climb to success is more like a jungle gym with multiple paths to the top. Anecdotes are given about Eric Schmidt's advice to take jobs in growing fields with advancement opportunities, even if they are less prestigious than more established positions, and how Lawrence Summers seemed to be critical with the author, then gave her more respect when she asserted herself. #Are You My Mentor? ‚Äì The advice is given that working professionals need a mentor but that the relationship between teacher and student cannot be forced. An anecdote is given about Clara Shih regularly asking questions in business that showed respect for her mentors' time. #Seek and Speak Your Truth ‚Äì As executive staff at Facebook, the author says that she along with others tried to make Facebook a non-hierarchical organization where everyone is free to speak their thoughts and criticism. Anecdotes are given in which Robert Rubin seeks advice from people who have fresh perspectives rather than deep experience in an existing culture and how Howard Schultz was open about sharing emotions. #Don't Leave before you Leave ‚Äì The author states that she has seen women forgo career advancement for family, but that she feels that some women do this too far in advance of developing family life. Anecdotes are given about Peggy Orenstein finding that even young girls imagine giving up career options to favor family life. The author then states that as a hiring and promoting manager, she often asks women of a certain age whether they plan to have children. She further states that she does not transgress discrimination laws against women who will need time off from work to have children, but rather wants the employees to be comfortable taking positions even when they are about to have a child. #Make your Partner a real Partner ‚Äì The author explores the concept of a \\"designated parent\\", which is supposed to be the person who does most of the childcare and is usually the woman. She reviews data that state that of the 28 women who direct Fortune 500 companies, only one had never married. Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique is cited as a source of information on the women's movement. Sandberg discusses her own marriage, which she and Dave Goldberg have set up in the Shared Earning/Shared Parenting style. #The Myth of Doing it All ‚Äì An anecdote is given in which Tina Fey says that the rudest question which people regularly ask women is \\"How do you do it all?\\", because the assumption is that a woman who is achieving in business must not have time to spend with family, and this same question is not asked to men in business. An anecdote about Laurie Glimcher describes how she recognizes that she cannot do all work and is frank about her limits. #Let's Start Talking about it ‚Äì The author recounts a bitter story when, as a congressional page, she was patted condescendingly on the head by Tip O'Neill, who asked if she was a pom-pom girl, meaning a cheerleader for male work. Kenneth Chenault is given as an example of a CEO who attempts to defend women from sexism in the workplace. #Working Together Toward Equality ‚Äì The author recalls the media attention that Marissa Mayer received for accepting a job as CEO of Yahoo while in her third trimester of pregnancy, and said that women get extra scrutiny in the workplace. She states that stay-at- home mothers frequently look down upon women with advanced careers, and that it is necessary that there not be tension between these groups. Reviews and criticism The book has been reviewed by various commentators. See responses to this review at * * In July, 2013, art and criticism journal The Baffler published a lengthy article on the book and its associated \\"movement\\" LeanIn.org. In the article, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Susan Faludi argues that self-described feminist Sandberg's message of women's workplace empowerment is actually a corporate-backed campaign that encourages women to promote themselves individually as \\"marketable consumer object[s]\\" for professional advancement, while discouraging solidarity and downplaying the damaging effects of systemic gender bias felt collectively by women in the workplace. The article further questions the selection criteria used by LeanIn.org for its corporate \\"Platform Partners\\", many of whom are burdened by \\"recent or pending EEOC grievances and state and federal court actions involving sex discrimination, sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, unfair promotion policies, wrongful terminations, and gender-based retaliations against female employees.\\" Faludi's analysis concludes with a detailed account of her failed attempts to contact Sandberg for an on-record interview, along with a section directly quoted from Faludi's email correspondence with Sandberg's public relations staff. In the emails, Faludi's requests for specific examples of LeanIn.org's supposed workplace activism and clarification of the group's support policy for its heavily marketed \\"Lean In Circles\\" peer group package appear to be met with deflective responses. The Guardian referred to Lean In as \\"an infantilising, reactionary guide for ambitious women.\\" In 2015, software engineer Kate Heddleston commented, \\"Women in tech are the canary in the coal mine. Normally when the canary in the coal mine starts dying you know the environment is toxic and you should get the hell out. Instead, the tech industry is looking at the canary, wondering why it can't breathe, saying \\"Lean in, canary. Lean in!\\" When one canary dies they get a new one because getting more canaries is how you fix the lack of canaries, right? Except the problem is that there isn't enough oxygen in the coal mine, not that there are too few canaries.\\" In 2018, Michelle Obama said that leaning in does not always work. Intersectionality: race, class, and sexual identity Author bell hooks wrote a critical analysis of the book, called \\"Dig Deep: Beyond Lean In\\". hooks calls Sandberg's position \\"faux feminist\\" and describes her stance on gender equality in the workplace as agreeable to those who wield power in society‚Äîwealthy white men, according to hooks‚Äîin a seemingly feminist package. hooks writes, \\"[Sandberg] comes across as a lovable younger sister who just wants to play on the big brother's team.\\" hooks states that mass media, along with Sandberg, tells us that any woman willing to work hard can climb the corporate ladder all the way to the top. The article further argues that Lean In ignores \\"the concrete systemic obstacles most women face inside the workforce.\\" hooks reasons that instead of the \\"Lean In\\" campaign inciting social change, its purpose is to provide women advice on how to become successful within existing conditions, and that effectively, Lean In does not consider the reality of intersectionality, which has been a growing subject in the contemporary feminist movement. The main elements in hooks' article, such as race, class, and sexuality, draw from her work Feminism Is For Everybody. In the book, hooks describes how not all women are made equally ‚Äì there is not a homogenous identity for women. hooks states that privileged white women know that their status is different from that of black women/women of color (pg.10); reformist white women with class privilege want the freedom they see men of their class enjoying (pg.38); and heterosexual women appeal more to men and society (pg.97). Kathleen Geier discussed in the article \\"Does Feminism Have a Class Problem?\\" that Sandberg's philosophy was that if more women advanced into leadership positions then all women would gain. Geier's response to this assumptions was: \\"there is little reason to have faith that Sandberg-style 'trickle-down' feminism will benefit the masses any more than its economic equivalent has ‚Ä¶ her enthusiasm for capitalism and her advocacy of a depoliticized strategy that focused on self- improvement rather than collective action troubled many feminists on the left.\\" Geier advises that the only effective and lasting way to advance economic equality is through collective political action; implementing some programs such as universal childcare, paid family and sick leave, and a European-style cap on work hours would resonate for women of all classes. In the same The Nation article, Judith Warner, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author, parallels Geier by saying that feminism should focus on structural problems and not individual adaptation. Women need to find experiences that unite them without forgetting the differences of class, race, education, and empowerment that set them apart. Warner also advocates that one of the most effective actions toward gender equality is fighting for meaningful workplace flexibility. The third contributor to The Nation article is Heather McGhee, president of Demos. She explains that a business model that relies on suppressed wages on those who are at the bottom of their society's social and political hierarchies ‚Äì women as well as that of immigrants, people of color, and the poor ‚Äì will not be feminist when a woman breaks through as a CEO. McGhee mentions some statistics gathered by Demos, which shows that retail's gender pay gap costs women an estimated $40.8 billion in lost wages annually, a total that will rise to $381 billion cumulatively by 2022. McGhee advocates that bridging the pay gap should be a focus for women. Along with Kathleen Geier, Judith Warner, and Heather McGhee, Nancy Folbre, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, discussed in the article about Lean In with relation to intersectionality. Folbre illustrated intersectionality as the following, \\"it's more-than-four-way intersection, there's no traffic light and people often don't know which way to turn. Some, driving luxury SUVs, will be perfectly safe. Others, on foot, are likely to get hurt. Gender is an important vehicle of collective identity. So too are class, race, ethnicity and citizenship.\\" Folbre continues to say that Lean In vindicates intersectional analysis as the focus of inequality in the book was only based on gender. Moreover, the book speaks to a selected few of women who are seeking to advance their careers, not those who are struggling to find and keep a stable job. Susan Faludi argues in a CNN article that Sandberg's Lean In is being attacked for all the wrong reasons. Faludi explains that challengers of Lean In cannot argue against Sheryl Sandberg without mentioning her net worth and the square footage of her house (1 billion and 9,200, respectively). Faludi expresses that a problem with the \\"Lean In\\" venture is that it leaves out single mothers: \\"Lean In offers a faux liberation for single mothers, as they couldn't 'lean in' if they wanted.\\" In the article, Faludi reasons that improving the lives of single mothers requires more than showing women of privilege how they can further advance themselves in society. This standpoint correlates to contemporary feminists who argue for social and cultural change to support \\"mothering\\" (including single mothers) as an empowering rather than oppressive experience. In 2015, OR Books published Lean Out: The Struggle for Gender Equality in Tech and Start-up Culture, edited by Elissa Shevinsky, which included a number of essays that make the above points and recount a variety of experiences of just how big the barriers for women in tech really are.  LeanIn.org  Sandberg founded LeanIn.org (also known as Lean In Foundation), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, dedicated \\"to offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals.\\" The organization offers educational resources and programming that encourages female leadership.

He practiced medicine from 1871 to 1891 in Tucson, Arizona Territory. He was first a contract surgeon for the U.S. Army at Camp Thomas and married an Apache woman. He became known for a fiery temper and during a disagreement with the post trader killed him, but was acquitted of all charges. Handy moved to Tucson in 1871 and remarried. He was selected in November 1886 as the first Chancellor of the University of Arizona and was a well-regarded physician. He founded the Pima County Medical Society in 1879 and helped set high standards for medical care. In 1884, he was among 58 Tucson pioneers who formed the Society of Arizona Pioneers. He severely abused his wife Mary Page, chaining her to a bed in their home for days and may have administered morphine to her until she was addicted. Two years later he was having an affair with a married woman and filed for divorce, accusing her of being \\"a morphine fiend and a common slut.\\" Handy publicly stated that any lawyer who defended her \\"would be sorry\\", and repeatedly threatened to kill her attorney Francis J. Heney. After he won the divorce trial and custody of their children, who he sent to live with his mother, he tried to evict Mary Page from the home the court had awarded her. In September 1891, he attacked Heney on the streets of Tucson and the attorney shot him in what was ruled as self-defense. Handy's good friend Dr. George E. Goodfellow, a nationally recognized expert in gunshot wounds, traveled to operate on Handy but was unable to save him, and Handy died the next day. Handy's son Jack was told by his paternal grandmother and aunt that Heney had attacked his father, but as an adult learned the truth from his maternal grandmother. Jack became friends with Heney and served as a pallbearer at his funeral.  Personal life Dr. John Handy of Tucson, Arizona Territory. Handy was born in on October 20, 1844 in Newark, New Jersey and moved with his parents to California in 1853. He graduated at age 19 from the Cooper College in San Francisco and received his medical diploma from Toland Medical School in 1865. He served as an Army contract surgeon in Arizona Territory at Fort Apache and Camp Thomas for two years. He learned the Apache language, married an Apache woman, and became a military interpreter. He treated the Apaches' illnesses and wounds, gaining their confidence. In 1870 two Apache guided him through hostile territory to Tucson. At Camp Thomas he got into a disagreement with the post trader, Mr. Huey, who \\"applied to him a term for the use of which many a man on the frontier had been launched into eternity.\\" Handy shot Huey who lived long enough to write a statement exonerating Handy, who called it a \\"matter of honor.\\" Based on Huey's statement, Handy was not charged. There are no other records of his Apache wife. Mary Page Handy on her wedding day. Her mother, Larcena Pennington Page, survived an Apache attack and crawled 16 days to help. On 17 July 1878 in Tucson, 34-year-old Handy married 16-year-old Mary Page Scott, (b. 14 September 1861). She was the daughter of Larcena Scott and William Fisher Scott. Her mother had earlier in life been kidnapped by the Apaches, wounded, and left for dead. Her mother gained fame after she crawled across the desert for 16 days and lived to tell the story. Her father was killed by Apache Indians before she was born. John and Mary had five children: Charles (b. 1879), Mabel (b. 1880), William (b. 1881), John Handy Jr. (\\"Jack\\" b. July 17, 1882), and Spencer (b. 1888).  Practice in Tucson  Handy ended his surgery contract with the Army and opened a practice in Tucson in August 1871 where he became the \\"foremost physician and surgeon\\". In 1873, he reached an agreement with the county board of supervisors to serve the indigent for the monthly salary of $45, and to furnish \\"board, washing, lodging, fuel, light, water, nurses, etc.\\" for $55 for the first patient, and $50 for each additional patient. During a smallpox epidemic in Tucson during 1877, 24 people died, and he offered the vaccine free to anyone who could not afford it. He won the \\"high respect and utmost confidence of the people.\\" He founded the Pima County Medical Society in 1879 and helped set high standards for medical care. He was the first attending physician when St. Mary's Hospital opened in 1880. Judge Richard E. Sloan described him as \\"the leading surgeon in Tucson, and in the Territory for that matter.\\" Handy served on the committee that celebrated the arrival of the Southern Pacific Railroad from California in Tucson. Dr. John C. Handy in front of his Tucson office. On January 31, 1884, he and his father-in-law William Fisher Scott joined 58 other Tucson pioneers and formed the Society of Arizona Pioneers, and two years later he was elected president of the group. He also developed a reputation for his fiery, violent temper. In 1886 the regents of the University of Arizona appointed him as the first chancellor. He was very interested in helping plan the university's first building but soon got into arguments with the regents about its design. He refused to attend any more regent meetings and after only six months he was removed from his office.  Abuse and divorce  Privately, his wife Mary complained to her neighbor, the wife of Ben Heney, that her husband abused her. In December 1888, pregnant once again, she filed for divorce. Rumors circulated that Handy had threatened to kill the judge and her lawyers and she withdrew her suit within the next month. Judge Sloan described Handy as \\"a man of strong will, aggressive, and both quarrelsome and vindictive.\\" Over the next four years she developed an addiction to morphine, possibly administered to her by her husband. Morphine at the time was readily available and prescribed for a variety of ailments. Handy sent their four children to live with his mother and sister in Oakland. By July 1898, Mary later testified that she was a virtual prisoner of her husband who chained her to a bedpost when he left home. She had a fifth child, Spencer, in 1888. Handy told her he had sent Spencer to Oakland as well and threatened to prevent her from ever seeing her children again unless she signed over her interest in their home to his mother as trustee for their children, which she did. The baby was actually still in Tucson. In July 1889 Handy filed for divorce and six months later got the court's permission to place Spencer in hospital custody. The town gossip was that Handy wanted to marry another woman named Mrs. Pansy Smith that he had been seeing for some time. Due to her husband's continual threats, Mary had difficulty finding an attorney. When C.W. Wright agreed to represent her, he asked Francis J. Heney to assist him. Heney reluctantly agreed whereupon Wright promptly withdrew from the case. Heney refused to continue on his own, and Mary went from attorney to attorney seeking representation. Heney finally agreed to reconsider her pleas for help. Handy relayed a message to Heney: \\"If Frank Heney takes the case I will kill him!\\" Handy publicly proclaimed that any attorney foolish enough to represent her in the divorce case \\"would be sorry.\\" He described his wife as \\"a morphine fiend and a common slut.\\" His attempts to intimidate Heney had the opposite effect, pricking Heney's conscience. Heney told his brother Ben, who lived across the street from Handy, that \\"If a lawyer can't take any case he feels it is right for him to handle, then he should take down his shingle.\\" Heney and Handy had several confrontations. On more than one occasion, as the lawyer walked along the street, Handy intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. Handy called Heney a coward and a son of a bitch and tried to provoke a fight. Clerk of the Court Brewster Cameron, a friend of both Handy and Heney, warned Handy that his threats might negatively influence the court, and Handy desisted for a while. The divorce trial dragged on for eight months, piling up a stack of legal documentation more than high of complaints, countercharges, motions and depositions from prominent Tucson citizens. Despite witnesses supporting his wife's allegations of abuse, Handy prevailed and obtained custody of all five children. But the judge ordered Handy to pay her $30 a month in alimony, gave her the family home, and rejected Handy's demand for a new trial. Handy sent Spencer to live with his family in Oakland. In July 1891, Handy, acting in his mother's name, sued his ex-wife for unlawful detainer of property, trying to force her out of the house that the court had granted her. His suit was dismissed but he went to a second judge and presented the deed that his wife had signed under duress two years previously. Heney represented Mary again and Handy made more death threats. Fearful for his life, Heney began carrying a pistol. Heney's brother Ben lived across the street from Handy and began accompanying his brother to and from the office. Ben reported that Handy said he would \\"take Frank's gun away and kill him with it.\\" Handy hired a former policeman named McCarthy as a bodyguard. On two occasions the four men confronted each other with their guns drawn.  Shooting and death  Francis J. Heney represented Handy's abused wife in their divorce trial and eviction proceeding despite repeated death threats from Handy. When Handy attacked him, Heney killed him in self-defense. At noon on Thursday, September 24, 1891, Francis Heney's brother Ben, who had been helping guard Francis, was in San Francisco attending to family business. Francis Heney left his office for lunch. His secretary Lautaro Roca was to join him momentarily. Handy waited outside the courthouse, and a half-block away at Pennington St. and Church Ave., as Heney walked past Handy, Handy suddenly shouted and grabbed the smaller man from behind, whirled him around, seized Heney by the throat and pushed him against a wall, choking him with all his might. Handy then let go and hit Heney in the face, saying, \\"Take that you son of a bitch.\\" Heney broke away and ran, pulling a pistol from his pocket. The noon-time crowd around the courthouse saw the fracas. Some shouted, \\"Don't shoot! Don't shoot!\\" Handy grabbed the pistol and tried to take the weapon from Heney. The two men struggled for control of it when it discharged, striking Handy in the lower abdomen. Handy, although wounded, lifted the smaller Heney off the ground and then both men fell to the street, still grappling for the revolver. But Heney refused to release his grip on the pistol while Handy still struggled for it. Deputy Sheriff John Wiegle and several other people finally removed the gun from Heney's grip and Handy's fingers from Heney's hands. Handy was supported as he walked to his own office a block away where he inspected his own wound. The bullet had nearly penetrated his body. Doctors Michael Spencer and Hiram Fenner removed the bullet from near the base of his spine. Handy was then taken to his home. Handy insisted that his friend Dr. George E. Goodfellow in Tombstone, widely known for his expertise in treating gunshot wounds, be summoned to repair the internal damage. While Handy waited, he dictated a statement in which he accused Heney of attacking him, and he also dictated his will. Heney immediately surrendered at the court house and his bond was set at $6,000. Three friends immediately posted his bail. A hearing was set for Saturday. After Goodfellow received a phone call with news of Handy's shooting, he rode by horseback to the nearest railhead in Benson, Arizona, where he boarded a railroad engine and caboose set aside just for him, and set out for Tucson. In an effort to get to Tucson faster, he took over the locomotive from the engineer and drove the train at high speed, and covered the in record time, arriving at 8:15 pm. Goodfellow began operating at about 10:00 pm, and he found 18 perforations in Handy's intestines, which he immediately set about cleaning and closing. But Goodfellow was too late and Handy died at 1:15 a.m., before Goodfellow could complete the surgery. Two days after the shooting, Heney was represented by Selim M. Franklin at the inquest into Handy's death. Cameron, the court clerk, testified that Handy had repeatedly threatened to kill Heney. Witnesses testified that on more than one occasion, as the lawyer walked along the street, Handy had intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. Witnesses and Heney told the court that Handy had attacked Heney. Many prominent witnesses affirmed that Heney acted in self-defense. Although Handy had a revolver, he had not removed it from his pocket. The judge found that Heney had acted in self-defense and exonerated Heney from any charges. Handy was honored with Masonic funeral rites in Tucson which were followed by a procession up Court Street including \\"a thousand Mexican women, wearing black rebozos\\" who had benefited from his services. His body was then transported by rail to Oakland, California, where he was buried in a family plot near his father.  Aftermath  Handy named his sister Cornelia Holbrook of in San Francisco administrix of his estate, which he divided among his five children. His ex-wife Mary unsuccessfully contested the will, and Holbrook sold all of Handy's Arizona property, including his office, horses, buggies, medical books, instruments, and mining claims. Handy's mother Roseanne's name was on the deed that Handy had coerced Mary into signing over. After the divorce, Roseanne Handy dropped the lawsuit to evict Mary from the Handy home. A year later Mary got a judge to cancel the deed and she regained ownership of the home. Three months after Goodfellow vainly tried to save her husband, Goodfellow performed his first vaginal hysterectomy on Mary. Her continued health challenges turned out to be from cervical cancer. She recovered for about four months when the cancer returned. Longing to see her children before she died, she asked her former sister-in- law and mother-in-law to send the children to Tucson, but they refused. Mary died on January 28, 1893. Her son John Handy Jr. (Jack) grew up in Oakland with his siblings at their paternal grandmother Roseanna Handel's home. The children were later sent to San Francisco to live with their aunt, Cornelia Holbrook. She told the children that their father had been murdered. She said that Heney had been the one who threatened and ambushed Handy, that he had been tried for murder and acquitted only because he was the sole witness. Young Jack grew up hating Heney. Jack was unhappy in both homes and ran away in 1896 at age 14 and went to sea on a whaling ship. Jack returned to San Francisco in 1902 and at age 19 married Beatrix Walter. They went to Tucson, where they lived with his maternal grandmother Larcena Pennington Page for about two years. They returned to San Francisco, where Jack eventually became an executive for Standard Oil. In 1906, Heney became nationally known when he successfully prosecuted timber fraud in Oregon. He was persuaded to investigate the crooked political system in San Francisco. Abe Ruef, the primary target of his investigation, dug up Cornelia's story that Heney had ambushed Handy and got The Daily News of San Francisco to publish her story. Ruef tried to persuade Jack to file charges. Instead, Jack went to visit Heney and thanked him for the support Heney had offered his mother under difficult circumstances, the true story Jack had heard from his grandmother in Tucson. The two men became lifelong friends, and Jack was a pallbearer at Heney's funeral in 1937.

Unfortunately, the standardization process was too long and regarding to the technology progress in this area, once the standard was finally agreed, it was obsolete. It generally uses 64 kbit/s channel as the basic unit of switching. It has a circuit switching orientation. Its major contribution was Frame Relay. It describes telecommunication that carries voice information in a narrow band of frequencies. N-ISDN basic rate is too low so for home as for business today. N-ISDN may be partly saved, but by an unexpected application: Internet access. Various companies now sell ISDN adapters that combine the 2B + D channels into a single 144 kbit/s digital channel. Many Internet providers also support these adapters. So the people can access the Internet over a 144 kbit/s digital link, instead of a 28.8 kbit/s analog modem link and for affordable price that may be a niche for N-ISDN for the next few years. N-ISDN is also known as Normal-ISDN. Narrowband refers to data communication and telecommunications tools, technologies and services that utilize a narrower set or band of frequencies in the communication channel. These utilize the channel frequency that is considered flat or which will use a lesser number of frequency sets. Narrowband is typically implemented in telecommunication technologies to carry voice data on a limited number of frequency sets. The size of the message sent via a narrowband technique utilizes lesser bandwidth than the cumulative bandwidth of the underlying channel. Narrowband is also used in sending audio spectrums that consume a restricted range of frequencies. The US FCC has allocated a specific range of frequency for mobile radio services based on narrowband that spans from 50cps to 64kbit/s.
