Collins English Dictionary. qi gong, chi kung, or chi gung () is a millenia-old system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (pronounced approximately as \\"chi\\"), translated as \\"life energy\\". Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind. People practice qigong throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self- healing, alternative medicine, meditation, self-cultivation, and training for martial arts. Clinical research on qigong for its potential benefit in treating disease has been inconclusive. There is no evidence that qigong has any therapeutic effect. Etymology Qigong (Pinyin), ch'i kung (Wade-Giles), and chi gung (Yale) are Romanized words for two Chinese characters: qì ('／') and gōng ('). Qi (or chi) is often translated as life energy, referring to energy circulating through the body; though a more general definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or the relationship between matter, energy, and spirit. Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. Gong (or kung) is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or accomplishment, and is often used to mean gongfu (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort.MDBG dictionary entry for Gong The two words are combined to describe systems to cultivate and balance life energy, especially for health and wellbeing. The term qigong as currently used was promoted in the late 1940s through the 1950s to refer to a broad range of Chinese self-cultivation exercises, and to emphasize health and scientific approaches, while de- emphasizing spiritual practices, mysticism, and elite lineages. History and origins The physical exercise chart; a painting on silk depicting the practice of Qigong Taiji; unearthed in 1973 in Hunan Province, China, from the 2nd-century BC Western Han burial site of Mawangdui Han tombs site, Tomb Number 3. With roots in ancient Chinese culture dating back more than 4,000 years, a wide variety of qigong forms have developed within different segments of Chinese society: in traditional Chinese medicine for preventive and curative functions; in Confucianism to promote longevity and improve moral character; in Daoism and Buddhism as part of meditative practice; and in Chinese martial arts to enhance fighting abilities. Contemporary qigong blends diverse and sometimes disparate traditions, in particular the Daoist meditative practice of \\"internal alchemy\\" (Neidan ), the ancient meditative practices of \\"circulating qi\\" (Xing qi ) and \\"standing meditation\\" (Zhan zhuang ), and the slow gymnastic breathing exercise of \\"guiding and pulling\\" (Dao yin ). Traditionally, qigong was taught by master to students through training and oral transmission, with an emphasis on meditative practice by scholars and gymnastic or dynamic practice by the working masses. Starting in the late 1940s and the 1950s, the mainland Chinese government tried to integrate disparate qigong approaches into one coherent system, with the intention of establishing a firm scientific basis for qigong practice. In 1949, Liu Guizhen established the name \\"Qigong\\" to refer to the system of life preserving practices that he and his associates developed based on Dao yin and other philosophical traditions. This attempt is considered by some sinologists as the start of the modern or scientific interpretation of qigong. During the Great Leap Forward (1958–1963) and the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), qigong, along with other traditional Chinese medicine, was under tight control with limited access among the general public, but was encouraged in state-run rehabilitation centers and spread to universities and hospitals. After the Cultural Revolution, qigong, along with t'ai chi, was popularized as daily morning exercise practiced en masse throughout China. Popularity of qigong grew rapidly during the Deng and Jiang eras after Mao Zedong's death in 1976 through the 1990s, with estimates of between 60 and 200 million practitioners throughout China. Along with popularity and state sanction came controversy and problems: claims of extraordinary abilities bordering on the supernatural, pseudoscience explanations to build credibility, a mental condition labeled qigong deviation, formation of cults, and exaggeration of claims by masters for personal benefit. In 1985, the state-run National Qigong Science and Research Organization was established to regulate the nation's qigong denominations. In 1999, in response to widespread revival of old traditions of spirituality, morality, and mysticism, and perceived challenges to State control, the Chinese government took measures to enforce control of public qigong practice, including shutting down qigong clinics and hospitals, and banning groups such as Zhong Gong and Falun Gong. Since the 1999 crackdown, qigong research and practice have only been officially supported in the context of health and traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese Health Qigong Association, established in 2000, strictly regulates public qigong practice, with limitation of public gatherings, requirement of state approved training and certification of instructors, and restriction of practice to state- approved forms. Through the forces of migration of the Chinese diaspora, tourism in China, and globalization, the practice of qigong spread from the Chinese community to the world. Today, millions of people around the world practice qigong and believe in the benefits of qigong to varying degrees. Similar to its historical origin, those interested in qigong come from diverse backgrounds and practice it for different reasons, including for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, alternative medicine, self-cultivation, meditation, spirituality, and martial arts training. Overview Practices Qigong comprises a diverse set of practices that coordinate body (), breath (), and mind () based on Chinese philosophy. Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, performed in a broad array of body postures. Qigong is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active qigong (dong gong), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive qigong (jing gong), with still positions and inner movement of the breath. From a therapeutic perspective, qigong can be classified into two systems: 1) internal qigong, which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and; 2) external qigong, which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits qi. As moving meditation, qigong practice typically coordinates slow stylized movement, deep diaphragmatic breathing, and calm mental focus, with visualization of guiding qi through the body. While implementation details vary, generally qigong forms can be characterized as a mix of four types of practice: dynamic, static, meditative, and activities requiring external aids. * Dynamic practice : involves fluid movement, usually carefully choreographed, coordinated with breath and awareness. Examples include the slow stylized movements of T'ai chi ch'uan, Baguazhang, and Xing Yi Quan. Other examples include graceful movement that mimics the motion of animals in Five Animals (Wu Qin Xi qigong), White Crane, and Wild Goose (Dayan) Qigong. As a form of gentle exercise, qigong is composed of movements that are typically repeated, strengthening and stretching the body, increasing fluid movement (blood, synovial, and lymph), enhancing balance and proprioception, and improving the awareness of how the body moves through space. * Static practice : involves holding postures for sustained periods of time. In some cases this bears resemblance to the practice of Yoga and its continuation in the Buddhist tradition. For example Yiquan, a Chinese martial art derived from xingyiquan, emphasizes static stance training. In another example, the healing form Eight Pieces of Brocade (Baduanjin qigong) is based on a series of static postures. * Meditative practice : utilizes breath awareness, visualization, mantra, chanting, sound, and focus on philosophical concepts such as qi circulation, aesthetics, or moral values. In traditional Chinese medicine and Daoist practice, the meditative focus is commonly on cultivating qi in dantian energy centers and balancing qi flow in meridian and other pathways. In various Buddhist traditions, the aim is to still the mind, either through outward focus, for example on a place, or through inward focus on the breath, a mantra, a koan, emptiness, or the idea of the eternal. In the Confucius scholar tradition, meditation is focused on humanity and virtue, with the aim of self- enlightenment. * Use of external agents : Many systems of qigong practice include the use of external agents such as ingestion of herbs, massage, physical manipulation, or interaction with other living organisms. For example, specialized food and drinks are used in some medical and Daoist forms, whereas massage and body manipulation are sometimes used in martial arts forms. In some medical systems a qigong master uses non-contact treatment, purportedly guiding qi through his or her own body into the body of another person. Forms There are numerous qigong forms. 75 ancient forms that can be found in ancient literature and also 56 common or contemporary forms have been described in a qigong compendium. The list is by no means exhaustive. Many contemporary forms were developed by people who had recovered from their illness after qigong practice. Most of the qigong forms come under the following categories: # Medical qigong # Martial qigong # Spiritual qigong # Intellectual qigong # Life nourishing qigong = Development of \\"health qigong\\" = In order to promote qigong exercises in a standardised and effective way with a scientific approach, The Chinese Health Qigong Association (CHQA) appointed panels of Qigong experts, Chinese medicine doctors and sport science professors from different hospitals, universities and qigong lineage across China to research and develop new sets of qigong exercises. In 2003 the CHQA officially promoted a new system called \\"health qigong\\", which consisted of four newly developed health qigong forms: * Health Qigong Muscle-Tendon Change Classic (Health Qigong Yì Jīn Jīng ). * Health Qigong Five Animals Frolics (Health qigong Wu Qin Xi ). * Health Qigong Six Healing Sounds (Health Qigong Liu Zi Jue ). * Health Qigong Eight Pieces of Brocade (Health Qigong Ba Duan Jin ). In 2010, the Chinese Health Qigong Association officially introduced five additional health qigong forms: * Health Qigong Tai Chi Yang Sheng Zhang (): a tai chi form from the stick tradition. * Health Qigong Shi Er Duan Jin (): seated exercises to strengthen the neck, shoulders, waist, and legs. * Health Qigong Daoyin Yang Sheng Gong Shi Er Fa (): 12 routines from Daoyin tradition of guiding and pulling qi. * Health Qigong Mawangdui Daoyin (): guiding qi along the meridians with synchronous movement and awareness. * Health Qigong Da Wu (): choreographed exercises to lubricate joints and guide qi. Other commonly practised qigong styles and forms include: * Soaring Crane Qigong * Wisdom Healing Qigong * Pan Gu Mystical Qigong * Wild Goose (Dayan) Qigong * Dragon and Tiger Qigong * Primordial Qigong (Wujigong) * Chilel Qigong *Phoenix Qigong *Yuan Qigong *Zhong Yuan Qigong Techniques Whether viewed from the perspective of exercise, health, philosophy, or martial arts training, several main principles emerge concerning the practice of qigong: * Intentional movement: careful, flowing balanced style * Rhythmic breathing: slow, deep, coordinated with fluid movement * Awareness: calm, focused meditative state * Visualization: of qi flow, philosophical tenets, aesthetics * Chanting/Sound: use of sound as a focal point Additional principles: * Softness: soft gaze, expressionless face * Solid Stance: firm footing, erect spine * Relaxation: relaxed muscles, slightly bent joints * Balance and Counterbalance: motion over the center of gravity Advanced goals: * Equanimity: more fluid, more relaxed * Tranquility: empty mind, high awareness * Stillness: smaller and smaller movements, eventually to complete stillness The most advanced practice is generally considered to be with little or no motion. Traditional and classical theory Qigong practitioners in Brazil Over time, five distinct traditions or schools of qigong developed in China, each with its own theories and characteristics: Chinese Medical Qigong, Daoist Qigong, Buddhist Qigong, Confucian Qigong, and Martial Qigong. All of these qigong traditions include practices intended to cultivate and balance qi. Traditional Chinese medicine The theories of ancient Chinese qigong include the Yin-Yang and Five Phases Theory, Essence-Qi-Spirit Theory, Zang-Xiang Theory, and Meridians and Qi-Blood Theory, which have been synthesized as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). TCM focuses on tracing and correcting underlying disharmony, in terms of deficiency and excess, using the complementary and opposing forces of yin and yang (), to create a balanced flow of qi. Qi is believed to be cultivated and stored in three main dantian energy centers and to travel through the body along twelve main meridians (Jīng Luò ), with numerous smaller branches and tributaries. The main meridians correspond to twelve main organs ) (Zàng fǔ ). Qi is balanced in terms of yin and yang in the context of the traditional system of Five Phases (Wu xing ). A person is believed to become ill or die when qi becomes diminished or unbalanced. Health is believed to be returned by rebuilding qi, eliminating qi blockages, and correcting qi imbalances. These TCM concepts do not translate readily to modern science and medicine. Daoism In Daoism, various practices now known as Daoist qigong are claimed to provide a way to achieve longevity and spiritual enlightenment, as well as a closer connection with the natural world. Buddhism In Buddhism meditative practices now known as Buddhist qigong are part of a spiritual path that leads to spiritual enlightenment or Buddhahood. Confucianism In Confucianism practices now known as Confucian qigong provide a means to become a Junzi () through awareness of morality. Contemporary qigong In contemporary China, the emphasis of qigong practice has shifted away from traditional philosophy, spiritual attainment, and folklore, and increasingly to health benefits, traditional medicine and martial arts applications, and a scientific perspective. Qigong is now practiced by millions worldwide, primarily for its health benefits, though many practitioners have also adopted traditional philosophical, medical, or martial arts perspectives, and even use the long history of qigong as evidence of its effectiveness. Contemporary Chinese medical qigong Qigong has been recognized as a \\"standard medical technique\\" in China since 1989, and is sometimes included in the medical curriculum of major universities in China. The 2013 English translation of the official Chinese Medical Qigong textbook used in China defines CMQ as \\"the skill of body-mind exercise that integrates body, breath, and mind adjustments into one\\" and emphasizes that qigong is based on \\"adjustment\\" (tiao , also translated as \\"regulation\\", \\"tuning\\", or \\"alignment\\") of body, breath, and mind. As such, qigong is viewed by practitioners as being more than common physical exercise, because qigong combines postural, breathing, and mental training in one to produce a particular psychophysiological state of being. While CMQ is still based on traditional and classical theory, modern practitioners also emphasize the importance of a strong scientific basis. According to the 2013 CMQ textbook, physiological effects of qigong are numerous, and include improvement of respiratory and cardiovascular function, and possibly neurophysiological function. Conventional medicine Especially since the 1990s, conventional or mainstream Western medicine often strives to heed the model of evidence-based medicine, EBM, which demotes medical theory, clinical experience, and physiological data to prioritize the results of controlled, and especially randomized, clinical trials of the treatment itself. *Tenny S & Varacallo M, \\"Evidence based medicine (EBM)\\" @ NIH.gov (Treasure Island, FL: StatPearls Publishing, 2020). *Guyatt GH, Haynes RB, Jaeschke RZ, Cook DJ, Green L, et al., \\"XXV, Evidence-based medicine: Principles for applying the Users' Guides to patient care\\", Users' Guides to the Medical Literature, in JAMA, 2000;284(10):1290-96, especially pp 1292–1293. *Liberati A & Vineis P, \\"Introduction to the symposium: What evidence based medicine is and what it is not\\", J Med Ethics, 2004 Apr;30(2):120–121. Although some clinical trials support qigong's effectiveness in treating conditions diagnosed in Western medicine, the quality of these studies is mostly low and, overall, their results are mixed. Integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine Integrative medicine (IM) refers to \\"the blending of conventional and complementary medicines and therapies with the aim of using the most appropriate of either or both modalities to care for the patient as a whole\\", whereas complementary is using a non-mainstream approach together with conventional medicine, while alternative is using a non-mainstream approach in place of conventional medicine. Qigong is used by integrative medicine practitioners to complement conventional medical treatment, based on complementary and alternative medicine interpretations of the effectiveness and safety of qigong. Scientific basis Scientists interested in qigong have sought to describe or verify the effects of qigong, to explore mechanisms of effects, to form scientific theory with respect to qigong, and to identify appropriate research methodology for further study. In terms of traditional theory, the existence of qi has not been independently verified in an experimental setting. In any case, some researches have reported effects on pathophysiological parameters of biomedical interest.Kevin Chen, Elizabeth R. Mackenzie & Master FaXiang Hou, \\"The benefits of qigong\\", in Elizabeth R. Mackenzie & Birgit Rakel, eds., Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Older Adults (New York: Springer, 2006).  Practitioners, uses and cautions   Recreation and popular use  People practice qigong for many different reasons, including for recreation, exercise and relaxation, preventive medicine and self-healing, meditation and self-cultivation, and training for martial arts. Practitioners range from athletes to the physically challenged. Because it is low impact and can be done lying, sitting, or standing, qigong is accessible for disabled persons, seniors, and people recovering from injuries.  Therapeutic use  Therapeutic use of qigong is directed by TCM, CAM, integrative medicine, and other health practitioners. In China, where it is considered a \\"standard medical technique\\", qigong is commonly prescribed to treat a wide variety of conditions, and clinical applications include hypertension, coronary artery disease, peptic ulcers, chronic liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, menopause syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, insomnia, tumors and cancer, lower back and leg pain, cervical spondylosis, and myopia. Outside China qigong is used in integrative medicine to complement or supplement accepted medical treatments, including for relaxation, fitness, rehabilitation, and treatment of specific conditions. However, there is no high-quality evidence that qigong is actually effective for these conditions. Based on systematic reviews of clinical research, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of using qigong as a therapy for any medical condition.  Safety and cost  Qigong is generally viewed as safe. No adverse effects have been observed in clinical trials, such that qigong is considered safe for use across diverse populations. Cost for self-care is minimal, and cost efficiencies are high for group delivered care. Typically the cautions associated with qigong are the same as those associated with any physical activity, including risk of muscle strains or sprains, advisability of stretching to prevent injury, general safety for use alongside conventional medical treatments, and consulting with a physician when combining with conventional treatment. Clinical research  Overview  Although there is ongoing clinical research examining the potential health effects of qigong, there is little financial or medical incentive to support high-quality research, and still only a limited number of studies meet accepted medical and scientific standards of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Clinical research concerning qigong has been conducted for a wide range of medical conditions, including bone density, cardiopulmonary effects, physical function, falls and related risk factors, quality of life, immune function, inflammation, hypertension, pain, and cancer treatment.  Systematic reviews  A 2009 systematic review on the effect of qigong exercises on reducing pain concluded that \\"the existing trial evidence is not convincing enough to suggest that internal qigong is an effective modality for pain management.\\" A 2010 systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on cancer treatment concluded \\"the effectiveness of qigong in cancer care is not yet supported by the evidence from rigorous clinical trials.\\" A separate systematic review that looked at the effects of qigong exercises on various physiological or psychological outcomes found that the available studies were poorly designed, with a high risk of bias in the results. Therefore, the authors concluded, \\"Due to limited number of RCTs in the field and methodological problems and high risk of bias in the included studies, it is still too early to reach a conclusion about the efficacy and the effectiveness of qigong exercise as a form of health practice adopted by the cancer patients during their curative, palliative, and rehabilitative phases of the cancer journey.\\" A 2011 overview of systematic reviews of controlled clinical trials, Lee et al. concluded that \\"the effectiveness of qigong is based mostly on poor quality research\\" and \\"therefore, it would be unwise to draw firm conclusions at this stage.\\" Although a 2010 comprehensive literature review found 77 peer-reviewed RCTs, Lee et al.'s overview of systematic reviews as to particular health conditions found problems like sample size, lack of proper control groups, with lack of blinding associated with high risk of bias. A 2015 systematic review of the effect of qigong exercises on cardiovascular diseases and hypertension found no conclusive evidence for effect. Also in 2015, a systemic review into the effects on hypertension suggested that it may be effective, but that the evidence was not conclusive because of the poor quality of the trials it included, and advised more rigorous research in the future. Another 2015 systematic review of qigong on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease concluded that some trials showed favorable effects, but concludes, \\"Most of the trials included in this review are likely to be at high risk of bias, so we have very low confidence in the validity of the results.  Mental health  Many claims have been made that qigong can benefit or ameliorate mental health conditions, including improved mood, decreased stress reaction, and decreased anxiety and depression. Most medical studies have only examined psychological factors as secondary goals, although various studies have shown decreases in cortisol levels, a chemical hormone produced by the body in response to stress. China Basic and clinical research in China during the 1980s was mostly descriptive, and few results were reported in peer-reviewed English-language journals. Qigong became known outside China in the 1990s, and clinical randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of qigong on health and mental conditions began to be published worldwide, along with systematic reviews.  Challenges Most existing clinical trials have small sample sizes and many have inadequate controls. Of particular concern is the impracticality of double blinding using appropriate sham treatments, and the difficulty of placebo control, such that benefits often cannot be distinguished from the placebo effect. Also of concern is the choice of which qigong form to use and how to standardize the treatment or amount with respect to the skill of the practitioner leading or administering treatment, the tradition of individualization of treatments, and the treatment length, intensity, and frequency. Meditation and self-cultivation applications Qigong is practiced for meditation and self-cultivation as part of various philosophical and spiritual traditions. As meditation, qigong is a means to still the mind and enter a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss. Many practitioners find qigong, with its gentle focused movement, to be more accessible than seated meditation. Qigong for self-cultivation can be classified in terms of traditional Chinese philosophy: Daoist, Buddhist, and Confucian. Martial Arts applications The practice of qigong is an important component in both internal and external style Chinese martial arts. Focus on qi is considered to be a source of power as well as the foundation of the internal style of martial arts (Neijia). T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Xing Yi Quan, and Baguazhang are representative of the types of Chinese martial arts that rely on the concept of qi as the foundation. Extraordinary feats of martial arts prowess, such as the ability to withstand heavy strikes (Iron Shirt, ) and the ability to break hard objects (Iron Palm, ) are abilities attributed to qigong training.  T'ai Chi Ch'uan and qigong  T'ai Chi Ch'uan (Taijiquan) is a widely practiced Chinese internal martial style based on the theory of taiji, closely associated with qigong, and typically involving more complex choreographed movement coordinated with breath, done slowly for health and training, or quickly for self-defense. Many scholars consider t'ai chi ch'uan to be a type of qigong, traced back to an origin in the seventeenth century. In modern practice, qigong typically focuses more on health and meditation rather than martial applications, and plays an important role in training for t'ai chi ch'uan, in particular used to build strength, develop breath control, and increase vitality (\\"life energy\\").

The first book explains that in the years following the disappearance of all humans, the animals of Welkin, both those wild and once domesticated, made their way into the abandoned castles and villages, using what the humans had left behind. Gradually the animals learned to speak human language and, to an extent, use human tools. While some of the animals were content to live in the forest, the mustelids in particular adapted to a more civilized way of living. The otters and mink took to the riverways; the badgers kept to the subterranean territories; the pine martens stayed in the trees; of the remaining weasels, stoats, and now-feral ferrets, the stoats were the most ambitious and aggressive, and took control of Welkin. Common Terms *Titles – The weasels and stoats use the terms jack and jill to refer to males and females, respectively.

The statues have the ability to talk, but most do so rather poorly and have only limited intelligence. All statues wander Welkin constantly in search of their \\"First and Last Resting Place,\\" that being the quarry from which the stones they were sculpted from were cut, or the forest from which the trees used to carve them were grown.

Raised in May 1942, as the 2/7th Independent Company, the 2/7th served in New Guinea in 1943 during the Salamaua-Lae campaign before being redesignated as the 2/7th Commando Squadron when it was amalgamated with two other commando squadrons to become part of the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment. Later at the end of 1944, it was sent to New Guinea again, where it took part in the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Following the end of the war, the squadron was returned to Australia and disbanded early in 1946. History Formation In late 1940 the Australian Army began considering the issue of raising independent companies or commando units for the conduct of irregular warfare.Horner 1998, p. 21. Based upon proposals and advice from the British Military Mission in Australia, in March 1941 the Army began training company-sized units that would act independently of higher command to carry out tasks such as raiding, sabotage, and subversion. As the war progressed the role that these independent companies would fulfill evolved towards guerrilla operations such as stay-behind, long range penetration and reconnaissance.Horner 1998, p. 22. In this regard between 1941 and 1942 eight independent companies were raised. The 2/7th Independent Company was one of these units, and was formed in May 1942, undertaking training at the Guerrilla Warfare School at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria.McCarthy 1959, p. 85. New Guinea 1942–1943 Following the completion of its training, the company was deployed to New Guinea in late 1942, landing at Port Moresby. From there it was flown to Wau in January 1943, where it was used to reinforce elements of the 6th Division and units Kanga Force during the Salamaua–Lae campaign. Between January and April, the company operated in conjunction with 2/3rd and 2/5th Independent Companies, performing mainly a traditional infantry role. During this time they conducted a number of patrols and were involved in a very successful ambush on a large force of Japanese, resulting in a high number of enemy casualties. Later, they were directly involved with the defence of Wau, before helping to push the Japanese back to Mubo, where they conducted small scale harassment raids. The 2/7th's commanding officer, Major Thomas MacAdie, was awarded a Distinguished Service Order for his gallantry and leadership during this phase of the campaign. In April, they were relieved by the 2/7th Battalion.McCarthy 1959, p. 586. They had served in the Wau area for seven months and were in need of rest, however, as there were no other troops available, on 29 May 1943 the 2/7th Independent Company was flown to Bena Bena where they became part of Bena Force.Dexter 1961, p. 238. Bena Force had originally been dispatched to the isolated airfield in January consisting of only a handful of men from the 2/7th Battalion, with the task of defending it against the advancing Japanese, harassing the enemy in the area and denying them freedom of movement, however, in May as Japanese air attacks on Bena increased it became necessary to reinforce the small garrison.Dexter 1961, pp. 234–235. As such the depleted 2/7th Independent Company was sent to Bena, under the command of Major MacAdie, bringing the garrison up to roughly four hundred men. During June and July, observation posts were established in the region, patrols were sent out and infrastructure was built with the help of labour supplied by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU).Dexter 1961, p. 239. Later, during August and September, as attacks increased on the garrison and the 2/2nd Independent Company arrived to reinforce Bena Force, patrols were sent out through the Ramu Valley in order to observe the main approaches to Bena Bena.Dexter 1961, pp. 243–244. In October, following a re-organisation of Australian forces in New Guinea in preparation for the coming offensive around Lae, the 2/7th was temporarily placed under the command of the 7th Division. Following this, the company began patrolling operations along the Faria, Iogi and Evapia rivers, until they were finally relieved by the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Squadron in the second week of November. The 2/7th then returned to Dumpu, before embarking at Port Moresby for the return to Australia, having been deployed on active service for the best part of a year. Reorganisation 1943–1945 Parade Atherton Tableland, Queensland. 1944-09-11. B Troop, 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regt, salute during a march. While the 2/7th Independent Company had been involved in the campaign in New Guinea, there had been a significant re- organisation of the way in which the Independent Companies were administered and organised.Horner 1989, p. 26. This was due to an army-wide reorganisation as the Australian Army shifted its strategic focus away from the Middle East and began to concentrate on the Pacific.Palazzo 2004, pp. 86-101. As a result of this reorganisation, the 2/7th Independent Company was renamed the 2/7th Cavalry Commando Squadron (later just commando squadron) and was absorbed into the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment, along with the newly formed 2/9th and 2/10th Commando Squadrons. Together, these units were attached to the 6th Division, to conduct long range patrol and reconnaissance operations.Johnston 2008, p. 193. Following their return from New Guinea, the newly formed 2/7th Commando Squadron concentrated on the Atherton Tablelands, Queensland, with the rest of the 2/6th Cavalry (Commando) Regiment. Throughout the rest of 1943 and most of 1944, the 2/7th carried out garrison duties and participated in exercises and training with the rest of the 6th Division. The squadron's last contribution to the Second World War came during the Aitape–Wewak campaign. Aitape–Wewak 1945 Early in 1945, the 6th Division relieved the American garrison at Aitape, with a view to renewing offensive operations in the area.Long 1963, p. 275. The 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment was the first Australian fighting unit to arrive at Aitape, and as it waited for the rest of the division to arrive, having left Brisbane on 22 October 1944, the regiment relieved the American outpost at Babiang and began to assist the ANGAU patrols in the area.Long 1963, p. 276. Once they had concentrated fully by November, the 6th Division began its advance eastwards towards the Japanese base at Wewak, in order to destroy the remnants of the Japanese 18th Army. Prior to this, however, the 2/7th Commando Squadron conducted preliminary patrols in order to gather information on topography and enemy dispositions in the region. The Australian advance began in December and by this time, the 2/7th had been moved to Tong, where it had been given the tasks of maintaining a base, control the surrounding area and conduct patrols to the south.Long 1963, p. 279. Now under the command of Major Goode,Long 1963, p. 279.Long lists Goode's rank as major, but in the Australian War Memorial source it is stated that he was only a captain. the squadron operated in support of the 17th Brigade, and had men stationed at Yourang and Kumbun.Long 1963, p. 280. During this time there were a number of clashes with the enemy, most notably on 11th and 13 December, as the squadron established its control over the area, resulting in a number of Japanese killed in action. Once it had been relieved by 17th Brigade, the squadron conducted a number of reconnaissance patrols south of the Torriccelli Ranges, around the Dandriwad and Danmap Rivers, and then later once it had moved to the Yasuar Mission, patrolling along the Muam River. Throughout February the 2/7th began to push into enemy territory, moving along the Atop River and establishing bases at Kaumala, and at House Copper. Finally, at the end of March, the 2/7th was relieved and returned to Aitape. The following month, the 2/7th was transported by landing craft to But, where they were to act as reserve for the 16th Brigade's advance to the Hawain River. While here, they were based at Banak and conducted a number of patrols in the surrounding area. As the campaign progressed into May, the 2/7th was transferred to the command of the 19th Brigade, which at the time was advancing on Wewak, with its limit of exploitation being the Brandi River.Long 1963, p. 370. As it became clear that the Japanese were attempting to abandon their positions, the 2/7th were ordered to advance in a wide circle and capture the Sauri villages, where it was believed that the Japanese had established a strong rearguard to act as a blocking force.Long 1963, p. 347. The 2/7th advanced up the Waringe River with a strength of 156 men, supported by mortar and artillery, and over the course of two days proceeded to clear the enemy from the high ground along which they would launch their assault on the villages. On 11 May, two troopsA military organisational term, roughly equivalent to an infantry platoon in size. Used for cavalry, engineers, armour instead of platoon. from the 2/7th launched their assault, advancing along a spur that led to Walanter where they encountered a well-established enemy position. This position was assaulted and the objective taken over the course of two and a half hours, with the assistance of close support from artillery and flamethrowers to overcome the enemy resistance.Long 1963, p. 348. The 2/7th were then relieved by elements of the 2/8th Battalion at Sauri, before receiving orders to concentrate with the rest of the 2/6th Commando Regiment in the area around Brandi Plantation. By the start of June they began \\"mopping up\\" operations, firstly at Dove Bay and then at Karawop, before they were sent to Boiken in July, where they relieved the 2/10th Commando Squadron, which had been patrolling the area around the Dagua and Hawain Rivers in an attempt to deal with the Japanese raiding parties that were still operating in the area.Long 1963, p. 381. The 2/7th were still in Boiken when Japan surrendered on 15 August 1945. They were disbanded approximately six months later, early in 1946, after the last members were returned to Australia and demobilised. During the course of its service, the squadron lost 30 men killed in action or died on active service.

The result of A. caninum infection ranges from asymptomatic cases to death of the dog; better nourishment, increasing age, prior A. caninum exposure, or vaccination are all linked to improved survival. Other hosts include carnivores such as wolves, foxes, and cats, with a small number of cases having been reported in humans. Warm and moist conditions are important to allow survival of A. caninum during the free-living stages of its lifecycle, so it is largely restricted to temperate, tropical, and subtropical regions. In parts of the world where these climatic requirements are met such as Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia, A. caninum is the main cause of hookworm disease in canines. Morphology Mouth and teeth of A. caninum A. caninum egg A. caninum females are typically long and wide, while the males are smaller at in length and in width. Males have a copulatory bursa , which consists of spine-like spicules positioned on three muscular rays that grasp the female during mating. As with other nematodes, the sperm lack flagella. The copulatory bursa is a unique feature of Strongylida members, thus making it a useful means for identifying members of this suborder; it is also used to distinguish members within the suborder due to differences in bursa appearance between species. The vulva of A. caninum females is located at the boundary of the second and final thirds of the body. The teeth of A. caninum are found in the buccal capsule and divided into three sets. Two ventral sets form a lower-jaw equivalent, while a further set projects from the dorsal side and loosely equates to an upper jaw. Each ventral set has three points, with those furthest to the sides being the largest. While the ventral sets are prominent, the dorsal set is hidden deeper in the buccal capsule. A. caninum bends its head end upward (dorsally), which has been noted to be a potential source of confusion when determining how the hookworm is oriented. If it has recently ingested blood, A. caninum is red in colour; if not, it appears grey. A. caninum has an alimentary canal made up of an esophagus, intestine, and rectum – the esophagus is highly muscular, reflecting its role in pulling intestinal mucosa into the body when it feeds. Esophageal and anal rings of A. caninum are the source of nerve fibres that extend throughout the body to innervate sensory organs, including amphids and phasmids. Eggs are laid by the females, typically when at the eight-cell stage. Eggs are 38–43 μm in width, with thin walls. Distribution Freezing, temperatures exceeding , drying, or exposing A. caninum to sunlight all give reduced survival of the free-living stage, with rates of infection rising with temperature, provided 37°C is not exceeded. A. caninum is, therefore, largely restricted to warm, moist climates, though infections are seen in the United States and southern Canada where the temperature is suboptimal. Specific niches are also able to satisfy the environmental requirements of A. caninum, despite not necessarily being in the tropics, such as mines. Lifecycle Transmission via the environment Eggs are excreted from the host in the feces and typically hatch within a day on moist, warm soil into larvae with a non-living cuticle layer. By 4–5 days, the larvae have moulted twice and are now able to infect a host. Migration occurs from the feces into the surrounding soil. Two routes of infection from the environment exist. The first route involves penetration of skin at hair follicles or sweat glands, especially between the footpads where contact with soil is frequent and the skin is thinner than otherwise. Secretion of a protease by A. caninum is thought to aid this process. The larvae then migrate through the dermis of the skin, enter the circulatory system and are carried to the lungs. A. caninum larvae exit the blood at the lungs, move from the alveoli up through the trachea and are swallowed to end up in the intestine. The second and more common route to the small intestine is by direct ingestion of A. caninum by the host, but the subsequent process is identical in either case. During this third stage of the larva, male or female reproductive organs become established. Larvae of this stage have been shown to secrete a molecule (Ac- asp-2) related to venom allergens in response to host-specific signals; this is thought to have a possible role in helping with the infection process. A third and final moulting occurs, resulting in the mature form of A. caninum, which then feeds on mucosa and blood of the small intestinal wall. The trigger of feeding is understood to be a receptor-mediated response; however, the detail of this process has yet to be established. Sexual reproduction also occurs in the intestine to produce a further round of eggs to complete the cycle. Females are thought to produce a pheromone which attracts males and are able to lay about 10,000 eggs per day. Direct transmission Direct transmission between hosts is also possible. Larvae having accessed through the skin may avoid exit via the lungs and remain in circulation for transport around the body. At the uterine artery of a pregnant female, the larvae are able to cross the placenta to cause prenatal infection of foetuses. Larvae of an infected foetus move to the liver until birth, when migration continues with movement to the intestine via the circulation and lungs as previously described. Alternatively, A. caninum larvae evading exit from the circulation at the lungs may instead be carried to the mammary glands and transmitted from the mother in her colostrum or milk to her pups; infection then proceeds in an identical manner as infection by ingestion from the environment. Infected mothers have been found to only rarely give prenatal transmission to pups, while the likelihood of causing transmission via the lactational route during nursing is much higher. Pathogenesis Damage during migration to intestine Pair of A. caninum hookworms. A. caninum larvae cause damage to the host at the point of entry through the skin, leaving a wound vulnerable to secondary infections. As the larvae migrate through the skin, an inflammatory response, dermatitis, is often stimulated, which can be exacerbated in hosts which have hypersensitive responses. Further damage is caused when the larvae leave the circulation and enter the lung, with the amount of damage dependent on the extent of the infection; pneumonia and coughing are common consequences. Damage once in intestine Once in the gut, A. caninum attaches to and ingests the mucosal lining along with some consumption of blood; up to 0.1 ml in 24hrs. In a 24hr period A. caninum typically feeds from six sites. This damage to the mucosa compromises the body's defences and can result in secondary infections by microbes. A group of anticoagulant proteins called A. caninum anticoagulant proteins (AcAPs), which inhibit a range of blood coagulation factors such as Xa, are used by A. caninum to help in the feeding process by preventing clotting and increasing blood loss. These AcAPs are among the most powerful natural anticoagulants that exist and are a key reason for anemia being caused and blood being observed in the faeces of infected hosts. Blood losses peak just prior to egg production by the females because this is when their requirements for food are greatest; the amount that they are eating is also peaking, so maximal damage to the intestine is being caused. Diagnosis Analysis of faeces is the definitive method by which a suspected A. caninum infection is confirmed. The faeces are sampled and examined microscopically for the characteristic ovular, thin-shelled eggs of A. caninum. Absence of eggs in faeces does not rule out infection; a significant delay of at least 5 weeks exists between initial infection and excretion of eggs in the faeces (larvae must fully mature and reproduce before eggs can be laid). In fact, pups frequently die before passing of eggs in the faeces begins. Using the number of eggs in stool samples as an indicator of the extent of infestation requires care to be taken because females have been shown to produce fewer eggs when the overall number of worms increases. Signs and symptoms expected to be observed are lethargy, weight loss, weakness, roughness of the hair coat, and pale mucous membranes indicative of anemia. Well-fed, older dogs with smaller infestations may present few or even none of these symptoms. Diarrhoea is rare, but stools are typically black due to the blood-derived haemoglobin present in them. The disease resulting from such A. caninum infection is referred to by the general term \\"hookworm disease\\" or the more specific terms \\"ancylostomiasis\\" and \\"ancylostomosis,\\" which recognise the genus of the causative nematode. Prevention and control Dog kennel: keeping kennels clean reduces risk of A. caninum infection. A clean environment minimises the risk of A. caninum infection; this can include regularly washed concrete or gravel in kennels instead of soil. Females are typically checked prior to using them for breeding purposes for nematodes such as A. caninum and birth and suckling can be restricted to sanitised areas to lower the risk of health complications to the pups. When infection of a pregnant dog is known or suspected fenbendazole or ivermectin can be administered to the female to help avoid transmission to the pups. Canines have been seen to develop significant resistance to A. caninum naturally with age; this protection develops faster in and fully mature females show substantially greater resistance than fully mature dogs. Specifically the age- related resistance means A. caninum takes longer to reach sexual maturity in older animals and fewer larvae fully develop. Vaccination Numerous vaccines have been developed with varying success against A. caninum. Use of an enzyme important in the worm's feeding process is popular, with one example being AcCP2, a protease, which, when used to vaccinate dogs, gives a strong antibody response, a lowering of numbers of eggs found in stools and a decrease in intestinal worm size. These effects are attributed to reduced AcCP2 activity upon antibody binding. A similar approach has been taken using another A. caninum digestive enzyme, AcGST1, but it failed to give statistically significant results in dogs. An alternative approach has been to disrupt the migratory ability of A. caninum; this was done successfully using the AcASP1 protein of A. caninum, which gives an increase in antibody levels of all subclasses, as well as a reduced worm burden. Other studies using the same vaccine have shown 79% reduction of worm burden resulting from this approach. Animals with prior exposure to A. caninum show enhanced resistance, but careful removal of all worms from the previous infection results in loss of this resistance. Studies in mice show resistance due to past exposure can protect against otherwise lethal worm doses and that this is a general form of resistance – defense is offered against subsequent infections via either mouth or skin. Medication Drugs used in treatment of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, and ivermectin. In humans In inappropriate hosts such as humans, A. caninum is able to enter the skin, but cannot proceed into the circulation and on to the intestine; instead, the disease dermal larva migrans results, caused by movement of the nematode within the skin and which can persist for several months without intervention. While access to the intestine is not possible via this route, it can occur via ingestion; in a report of 93 enteritis cases in northern Queensland, Australia, which were possibly caused by A. canium infection, all those interviewed described behaviour consistent with A. caninum exposure and a colonoscopy of one patient gave positive identification of an adult A. caninum worm. Since then, work has shown A. caninum can easily go unnoticed or fail to be preserved in specimens, making the true incidence of infection in humans likely to be higher than is officially recorded. Economic burden The animals affected by A. caninum infection are not used for food or labour purposes, thus the economic burden from animal illness is low. Human A. caninum infections are likely underestimated and misdiagnosed; the economic impact caused by missing work due to infection may be underestimated and significant.

She wrote about her personal experiences living with spinocerebellar ataxia which was later published in the book 1 Litre no Namida. Early life Aya Kitō was born to Shioka, a nurse, and her husband Mizuno, an office worker. She was the oldest of five siblings, the other four being Ako Kitō, Hiroki Kitō, Kentaro Kitō and Rika Kitō. At the age of 14, Aya started writing a diary. From the age of 15, after her diagnosis, she used it to record her experiences, including her symptoms. At the age of 15, in 1977, Aya was diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia. Her friends helped her with climbing the stairs or walking. But it became harder for them and specially Aya, so she went to a school for disabled people. Until the age of 25, Aya's health continually worsened, and she was eventually unable to complete daily tasks (ADLs). She eventually became confined to her bed, and was unable to walk or speak. Aya had the incurable disease for 10 years and experienced both emotional and physical pain, which was subsequently stressful to her family as well. Her family, however, continued to support her for the remainder of her life. Death and legacy Aya Kitō died as a result of her disease on May 23, 1988, only two months before her 26th birthday. She also contracted uremia due to organ failure. Her body was donated for medical research. Her diary, entitled , was first published in her native Japan on February 25, 1986, more than two years before her death at the age of 25. Her mother, Shioka Kitō, convinced her to publicize her diary in order to give hope to others since Aya had always wanted to be able to help others. Her diary was later adapted into a 2004 film, as well as a 2005 television drama series from Fuji TV in which Erika Sawajiri portrayed Kitō. Shioka also wrote a book after Aya's passing, named Hurdles of Life, to recall Aya's struggles from her own perspective.

This included elections from Local governments all the way up the ladder to federal elections. Some state positions, as well as federal positions, were up for election. The 2009 legislative elections were held on July 5, 2009. The election that was being decided was 500 new members in the Chamber of Deputies for the 61st Congress. This election was statistically really close. The Elections were won by the PRI party also known as the Institutional Revolutionary Party. They had 12,591,855 Votes resulting in them getting 48.2% of the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI was followed by the PAN party also known as the National Action Party and the PRD party also known as the Party of the Democratic Revolution. They had 9,549,798 and 4,164,393 votes that rewarded them 147 and 72 spots in the chamber of Deputies respectively. As a result of this, the leader of the PRI party Beatriz Parades stated that \\"We are the indisputable main force in the country\\" This came after they found out that they would be winning the Chamber Of Deputies majority.  Felipe Calderon Influence  Many people saw the president Felipe Calderon as a big influence as to why the National Action Party (PAN) finished second in the elections. President Calderon was a part of the PAN party. At the time of the elections, Mexico's economy was weak, which in many eyes hurt his parties chances at winning the election. \\"He got a beating because of the economy,\\" said Ana Maria Salazar, a television and radio political commentator in Mexico City. \\"The government in power pays for it,\\" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. With all this being said Calderon did acknowledge the fact that his party lost in a triumphant way by saying \\"The federal government recognizes the new composition of the Chamber of Deputies since it is a sovereign decision of the citizens. I congratulate who they have chosen,\\" he also stated that he'd work with these new representatives that got into office. Local elections Throughout 2009 there was 11 local state elections and 1 federal district local election. This Included the states of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Colima, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Nuevo León, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, Coahuila, and Tabasco. The federal district of Mexico City also had local elections. Positions up for elections included Legislative Assembly, State Congress, Governor, Municipalities, and Borough Mayors. The Majority of these elections took place on July 5, 2009 going hand in hand with the legislative elections but a few were different. Quintana Roo's Election took place on February 1 in 2009. The state of Coahuila took place on September 24 of 2009. The state of Tabasco elections took place on October 18, 2009. Mexico Cities federal district was different than the rest as they voted for Legislative Assembly and Borough Mayors rather than state congress and Governors since they technically aren't a state.

The line's history The OIR linked the quarry with the Great Western Railway about to the east at a junction just north of Banbury. The line was opened between 1917 and 1919 and closed in 1967; the line was 'lifted', that is the line was formally closed and physically removed from the site, between 1967 and 1968. The quarry was heavily worked in the Second World War. The line also served the Banbury Alcan works at one point. The popular footpath from Drayton to Drayton Lodge crossed the railway at Drayton Crossing. Wroxton Central Ironstone Quarry was opened by 1919, closed and filled in 1967. Langley Ironstone Quarry was built near Balscot by 1926, and was closed and filled during 1943 when it ran out of ironstone. Dyke Lane Bridge was built in 1940 and abandoned in 1967. The line was extended to the Balscote Quarry which was worked between 1956 and its closure in 1967. Balscote Quarry, a shorter-lived working, was built by 1956, but closed and filled in 1967. A newer quarry close by its former site is now served by road haulage only. The mine buildings, manager's house and workers' halt are now a small set of new light industrial buildings, built circa 2006–2008. The track works' permanent way huts (p-huts) still stood at Drayton in 2007 and Horley in 2002. A few old OIR fence posts/gates remain to this day along the route. Banbury's Ruscote and Hardwick estate's (Daimler Avenue, Devon Way and Longelandes Way) are also built over a large part of its route, including most of the former Pen Hill farm grading works (Longelandes Way). Other built over places include the proposed minor Pin Hill maintenance depot (Pin Hill Road) and major active Pen Hill maintenance depot (Beaumont Road). Despite the development that has occurred north of Banbury since closure, much of the line of the route can be walked today. Locomotive fleet The OIR operated its own fleet of steam locomotives: 0-6-0T and 0-6-0ST locomotives built by Hunslet and 0-4-0ST's built by Hudswell Clarke. They also purchased thirteen Rolls-Royce Sentinel diesel-hydraulic locomotives fitted with Rolls-Royce C range engines in the 1960s..

He founded it in 1958 with five engineering departments. He also founded the University of Mazandaran and Iran University of Science and Technology.  Background  Habib Naficy was born in Rasht in December 1908. His father, Dr. Ali Asghar Naficy, Moadeb od Dowleh, was a well-known physician who served as the doctor and guardian of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, when as Crown Prince he attended boarding school in Switzerland. Naficy’s grandfather, Dr. Ali Akbar Naficy, Nazem ol Atteba, was a senior court physician during the Qajar Dynasty, and a medical scholar, known for having compiled the “Naficy Encyclopedia” (Fahrangeh Naficy), and for establishing Western-style hospitals in Tehran, Mashad and Isfahan. Habib Naficy received his early education in Tehran at the Ecole Saint Louis, a French Catholic School, and at the famous Dar el Fonoun School. He broke with family tradition by studying engineering at the university level, because he believed that what Iran needed most were engineers. He completed his undergraduate university education in mechanical engineering at the University of Toulouse in France, and in electrical engineering at an institute in Paris. Upon returning to Iran, he joined the Army and was sent on a government scholarship to receive practical training at a trucking company in Indianapolis, purchase armored trucks for the Iranian Army, and at the same time pursue graduate studies in mechanical engineering at Purdue University. When relations between Iran and the U.S. soured because of a diplomatic incident, he was called back and sent instead to Germany in 1936 to continue his practical training and purchase trucks for the Iranian Army. He also spent some time training in Czechoslovakia.  Career  After finishing his practical training in Germany, Habib Naficy returned to Iran in 1938 to become director of a military ammunitions factory at Saltanat-Abbad in the suburbs of Tehran. He left the Army in 1943 to become Director of Labor Affairs in the Ministry of Commerce. In this position he was instrumental in drafting the first comprehensive labor laws in Iran in 1946. He was the leader of the Iranian delegation to the ILO Conference 1945 in Paris (Habib Nafici 3rd from the left, 4th Abolhassan Hakimi, 5th the famous Iranian writer Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh). After the establishment of Ministry of Labor in the same year, he became Undersecretary of Labor, a position he held until 1950. During this time, he tried to improve the condition of workers, and as a staunch anti- communist, he promoted the formation of non-communist labor unions as counterweight to the labor unions affiliated with the pro-communist Tudeh Party. Naficy was briefly Deputy Minister and Acting Minister of Labor in 1951 in the short-lived Hossein Ala cabinet, preceding Dr. Mossadegh’s government. During the Mossadegh period, Habib Naficy was instrumental in establishing the Ministry of Industries and Mines, with himself serving as Undersecretary, a post he continued to hold under the Zahedi cabinet in the mid-1950s. In this position he was credited with establishing one of the first industrial estates (industrial zones) for light industries at Karaj west of Tehran. In the late 1950s, Naficy was named Undersecretary for Technical and Vocational Education in the Ministry of Education with the mission to reinvigorate and expand that type of education, which had been initiated during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi. In that position he established some one hundred technical and vocational schools throughout Iran. He established the Tehran Polytechnic University (now Amir Kabir University) as well, which emphasized practical engineering education. He served as President of the institution, keeping the tuition low so that students of limited income could attend. He also established the Technical Teachers College (now Elm o Sanaat University), and the Higher Commercial College (Madresseh Aali e Bazargani), both in Tehran. During this time he taught part-time at the Faculty of Engineering of Tehran University. In 1963, Habib Naficy was appointed Cultural Minister/Councilor, with the rank of Chargé d'Affaires, and Supervisor of Iranian Students in the United States and Canada at the Iranian Embassy in Washington, D.C. a position he held until 1966. He tried to improve services offered to Iranian students in the U.S. While in that position, he also taught part-time at the School of Engineering at the University of Maryland. In 1966, he was once again named Undersecretary of Education for Technical and Vocational Education and President of the Tehran Polytechnic University. During this period he established about 20 Technological Institutes (technical junior colleges) in various Iranian provinces. He held these two positions until his retirement from full-time government work in 1968. After retiring from full-time government service, he established the Naficy Technikum, a private, combined technical college and secondary technical school, which placed emphasis on practical work. He spent most of his effort in the 1970s on developing that institution. At the same time in the 1970s he was asked to serve as Undersecretary for Human Resources Development at the Ministry of Transportation, on a part-time basis. He held these two positions until the 1979 revolution. After the revolution, Habib Naficy continued as President of the Naficy Technikum for almost a year. He was arrested in early 1980 by a group of Revolutionary Guards and Technikum staff close to them, who made charges against him (citizen arrest), although there was no government warrant for his arrest. The charges included his allegedly writing reports on dissidents while working at the Iranian Embassy in Washington, D.C. notably about Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who was a close aide to Khomeini, and served as post- revolution head of Iranian Radio and Television and as Foreign Minister, before falling afoul of the Islamic Government and being executed in 1981. Naficy was kept in jail for ten months before being tried. Many of his former students and employees attended his trial to defend him. He was cleared of charges and released in 1981. He died in 1984. In recent years, the Islamic Government has recognized Naficy’s contributions and held a ceremony in his memory at the Amir Kabir University. Habib Naficy is principally known for his work of drafting the first comprehensive labor laws in the 1940s, and for expanding technical education at both the secondary and university levels in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He is remembered as an energetic man, dedicated to his work and to public service. He believed that technical and vocational education were key to Iran’s progress, and placed emphasis on practical, hands-on technical training. He was considered as one of Iran’s early technocrats. He served as undersecretary of various ministries for over thirty years. He was offered ministerial positions several times but turned them down, because he believed that the position of undersecretary was more stable and that he could accomplish more in such a position.  Relatives  Habib Naficy came from a large, well-known Persian family. He was the brother of the late Dr. Abbas Naficy who served as Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health in the late 1940s, and Secretary General of Lion and Sun Society in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as senator in the 1960s. He was also the brother of the late Dr. Mahmonir Naficy Jazayeri, one of the first female professors at Tehran University, where she taught French Literature. He was the nephew of the late Sa’id Naficy (also Saeed Nafisi), the well-known writer and historian, and was both the nephew and first cousin of the late Eng. Fathollah Naficy, the former Vice-Chairman of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). Habib Naficy was also the second cousin of Ahmad Nafisi, the mayor of Tehran in the early 1960s and father of Azar Nafisi, the author of the bestseller, Reading Lolita in Tehran. Habib Naficy was married twice. He had a son called Hossein by his first marriage to Zarrin Malak Hakimi, grand daughter of Mirza Mahmoud Hakim el Molk, daughter of Hossein Hakimi. She was raised by her Aunt Belghis Hakimi (married to Ebrahim Hakimi Hakim el Molk) after her father's death. Zarrin Malak committed suicide in 1947 by drowning herself in Rhone River where it exits Lake Geneva. Habib Naficiy's second marriage was to Dr. Ozma Adle, who was Director of Women’s Affairs at the Ministry of Labor in the late 1940s, and the translator of French literary works into Persian. He had three children with Ozma. Kamran, Kaveh and Kambiz. All three have distinguished careers in their fields of endeavor.

History In 1868, a two-story public school building was constructed at the corner of West Malone and School Street. In 1884, this building was destroyed by a tornado. In 1885, a four-room building was rebuilt on this site and known as South Grade School. In 1900, another new building was constructed on this site. The Sikeston Public Schools system held its first four-year high school graduation commencement in 1904. In 1924, Sikeston built a segregated school to be used only by African American students until the U.S. Supreme Court delivered the landmark ruling of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 which declared segregation to be unconstitutional. The Lincoln School still stands in western Sikeston. The high school newspaper is known as The Bulldog Barker while the high school yearbook is known as The Growler. Buildings The Sikeston Field House, the school's home gymnasium, was completed in 1969 as a multi-purpose athletic facility with a seating capacity exceeding 3,000 persons. After a bond issue was voted on and passed by the city, the building was updated and remodeled into a more attractive, state-of-the-art sporting arena in 1992. With improved lighting, sound and climate control, the Sikeston Field House has become a popular venue for non- athletic events as well. The Field House distinguishes itself with its large silver dome that is easily recognizable from the air. Academics The Sikeston R-6 School District serves the educational needs of most of the city's residents and some of the nearby areas including the cities of Morehouse and Miner. Music In 1934, Reid Jann started the High School band program. In 1940, Keith Collins (1916-1974) became Director of Bands and Supervisor of Music for Sikeston High School. Collins stayed in this position until 1970 except for time spent in the U.S. Marine Corps including as director of the West Coast Marine Air Corps Band in San Diego. In 1955, the school started an orchestra program under James Butler and hired future Missouri first lady Betty Cooper to take over the high school choir. Collins helped design the band building built for the new high school in 1960. Collins along with LeRoy Mason of Jackson High School formed the Southeast Missouri High School Band Association.

The show follows the comic and upbeat television host Tim Tayag around the Philippine and Asian countries. The program is a co-production of Bacon Burger Productions and CCI Asia Group Corporation and is being aired in the Philippines via The Living Asia Channel. It is also being aired simultaneously in North America via The Filipino Channel Direct. In Asia, the channel can be seen in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Laos as well via The Mabuhay Satellite Corporation. In the Philippines, The Living Asia Channel is currently aired on major cable networks such as Home, Dream, Destiny and Sky. On-Foot is everyday three times a day on an eight-hour loop seen simultaneously in the other countries with broadcast partners. Objectives According to Tayag's official website,http://www.timtayag.com On-Foot is aimed at young independent travelers; a sort of streetwise cookbook for traveling alone. When you travel on foot and interact with the locals, you penetrate the veneer of the guidebooks and maps and mine the grit of real life. Self- proclaimed traveltologist, Tayag, provides a comic element while the show highlights concise information and thorough coverage of the destination via humorous pop up graphics and animation. The program explores unusual places, samples unusual dishes and purchases unusual gift items. The show is targeted to Filipinos both here and abroad who want to encounter the lighter side and offbeat experiences of traveling in the Philippines and other Asian countries. On-Foot is an indispensable resource with practical information that can be used by every traveler. In the course of each show, Tayag tours each place and interacts with the town’s locals occasionally with the use of subtitles for the viewers from other countries). History The show’s initial seed was planted in Tayag’s mind back when he was living in San Francisco circa 2000. He came back to the Philippines and met Katrina Holigores, a female mover and shaker in the film industry. The idea man and cinematographer woman build a partnership that involved a lot of meetings.http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/tl/tl012468.htm Holigores used her vast connections to form the proper production team to produce this show. So the band of three was formed: Tim as the host and writer, Holigores as the director and half-time cinematographer, and a fellow by the name of Alan Bengzon to bring in steadicam operation and other useful equipment. Tayag met Leo Udtohan in 2006, a journalist from Bohol who produced four episodes on Bohol and Siquijor, Tayag in an interview said, \\"Bohol is the best episode so far on On-Foot.\\" Episodes • Quiapo • Baguio (2008) • Cebu (2008) • Siquijor (2007)http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=356963 • Baguio 1 (2007) • Baguio 2 (2007) • Boracay (2007) • Batangas (2008) • Bohol 1 Bizarre Bohol(2007) • Bohol 2 Bizarre Bohol(2007) • Bohol 1 Bizarre Bohol(2006) • Bohol 2 Bizarre Bohol(2006) • Malaysia (2007) • Malaysia 2 (2007) • Nature Spa: Tagaytay (2008) • Off the Wall 1 (2007) • One Foot in Iloilo (2007) • One Foot on Iloilo 2 (2007) • Palawan (2007) • Sagada (2007) • Sagada 2 • Siargao (2007) • Siargao 2 (2007) Sources * http://timtayag.com/ * http://livingasiachannel.net/onfoot/index.html * http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=356963 Category:2001 Philippine television series debuts Category:Philippine travel television series ","title":"On-Foot"},{"id":"21557132","text":"SS Statendam was a 10,322 ton (gross) ship of the Holland America Line, built by Harland and Wolff, launched in 1898 and completed on 18 August 1898.

Most firms in the entertainment industry have never owned their own studios, but have rented space from other companies. There are also independently owned studio facilities, who have never produced a motion picture of their own because they are not entertainment companies or motion picture companies; they are companies who sell only studio space. The largest film studio in the world is Ramoji Film City, in Hyderabad, India. Beginnings The Babelsberg Studio near Berlin was the first large-scale film studio in the world and the forerunner to Hollywood. It still produces movies every year. In 1893, Thomas Edison built the first movie studio in the United States when he constructed the Black Maria, a tarpaper-covered structure near his laboratories in West Orange, New Jersey, and asked circus, vaudeville, and dramatic actors to perform for the camera. He distributed these movies at vaudeville theaters, penny arcades, wax museums, and fairgrounds. The first film serial, What Happened to Mary, was released by the Edison company in 1912. The pioneering Thanhouser film studio was founded in New Rochelle, New York in 1909 by American theatrical impresario Edwin Thanhouser. The company produced and released 1,086 films between 1910 and 1917, successfully distributing them around the world. In the early 1900s, companies started moving to Los Angeles, California. Although electric lights were by then widely available, none were yet powerful enough to adequately expose film; the best source of illumination for motion picture production was natural sunlight. Some movies were shot on the roofs of buildings in Downtown Los Angeles. Early movie producers also relocated to Southern California to escape Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company, which controlled almost all the patents relevant to movie production at the time. The first movie studio in the Hollywood area was Nestor Studios, opened in 1911 by Al Christie for David Horsley. In the same year, another 15 independents settled in Hollywood. Other production companies eventually settled in the Los Angeles area in places such as Culver City, Burbank, and what would soon become known as Studio City in the San Fernando Valley. The \\"majors\\" The Big 5 By the mid-1920s, the evolution of a handful of American production companies into wealthy motion picture industry conglomerates that owned their own studios, distribution divisions, and theaters, and contracted with performers and other filmmaking personnel, led to the sometimes confusing equation of \\"studio\\" with \\"production company\\" in industry slang. Five large companies: RKO Radio Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros., and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer came to be known as the \\"Big Five,\\" the \\"majors,\\" or \\"the Studios\\" in trade publications such as Variety, and their management structures and practices collectively came to be known as the \\"studio system\\". The Little 3 Although they owned few or no theaters to guarantee sales of their films, Universal Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and United Artists also fell under these rubrics, making a total of eight generally recognized \\"major studios\\". United Artists, although its controlling partners owned not one but two production studios during the Golden Age, had an often-tenuous hold on the title of \\"major\\" and operated mainly as a backer and distributor of independently produced films. The minors Smaller studios operated simultaneously with \\"the majors.\\" These included operations such as Republic Pictures, active from 1935, which produced films that occasionally matched the scale and ambition of the larger studio, and Monogram Pictures, which specialized in series and genre releases. Together with smaller outfits such as PRC TKO and Grand National, the minor studios filled the demand for B movies and are sometimes collectively referred to as Poverty Row. The independents The Big Five's ownership of movie theaters was eventually opposed by eight independent producers, including Samuel Goldwyn, David O. Selznick, Walt Disney, Hal Roach, and Walter Wanger. In 1948, the federal government won a case against Paramount in the Supreme Court, which ruled that the vertically integrated structure of the movie industry constituted an illegal monopoly. This decision, reached after twelve years of litigation, hastened the end of the studio system and Hollywood's \\"Golden Age\\". Typical components By the 1950s, the physical components of a typical film studio had become standardized. Since then, a film studio has usually been housed inside a physically secure compound with a high wall, which protects filmmaking operations from unwanted interference from paparazzi and crazed fans of leading movie stars. Movement in and out of the studio lot is normally limited to specific gates (often capped with grand decorative arches), where visitors must stop at a boom barrier and explain the purpose of their visit to a security guard. The sound stage is the central component of a studio lot. Most film studios have several; small studios may have as few as one, and large studios have as many as 20 to 30. Film studios also provide office space for studio executives and production companies, and makeup rooms and rehearsal rooms for talent. If space allows, a studio may have an outside backlot. Finally, there is a studio \\"commissary\\", which is the traditional term in the film industry for what other industries call a company cafeteria. In addition to these basic components, the largest film studios are full- service enterprises offering the entire range of production and post- production services necessary to create a motion picture, including costumes, props, cameras, sound recording, crafts, sets, lighting, special effects, cutting, editing, mixing, scoring, ADR, re-recording, and foley. Independent suppliers of all these services and more (e.g., photographic processing labs) are often found in clusters in close proximity to film studios. Nitrate film, manufactured until 1951, was highly flammable, and sets and backlots were and still are very flammable, which is why film studios built in the early-to-mid 20th century have water towers to facilitate firefighting. Water towers \\"somewhat inexplicably\\" evolved into \\"a most potent symbol ... of movie studios in general.\\" Film to television Halfway through the 1950s, with television proving to be a lucrative enterprise not destined to disappear any time soon—as many in the film industry had once hoped—movie studios were increasingly being used to produce programming for the burgeoning medium. Some midsize film companies, such as Republic Pictures, eventually sold their studios to TV production concerns, which were eventually bought by larger studios, such as the American Broadcasting Company which was purchased by Disney in 1996. Today With the growing diversification of studios into such fields as video games, television stations, broadcast syndication, television, theme parks, home video and publishing, they have become multi- national corporations. International markets account for growing proportion of Hollywood movie revenue with approximately 70% of total movie revenue coming from international ticket sales and the Chinese domestic box office revenue is projected to outpace those of USA in 2020. The growth of film studios and filmmaking outside of Hollywood and the USA have produced popular international film studio locations such as Hollywood North (Vancouver and Toronto in Canada), Bollywood (Mumbai, India), and Nollywood (Lagos, Nigeria). As the studios increased in size they began to rely on production companies, like J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions, to handle many of the creative and physical production details of their feature films. Instead, the studios transformed into financing and distribution entities for the films made by their affiliated production companies. With the decreasing cost of CGI and visual effects, many studios sold large chunks of their once massive studio spaces or backlots to private real-estate developers. Century City in Los Angeles was once part of the 20th Century Studios backlot, which was among the largest and most famous of the studio lots. In most cases, portions of the backlots were retained and are available for rental by various film and television productions. Some studios offer tours of their backlots, while Universal Pictures allows visitors to its adjacent Universal Studios Hollywood theme park to take a tram tour of the backlot where films such as Psycho and Back to the Future were once shot. In fall 2019, movie mogul Tyler Perry opened Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. The studio lot is claimed to be larger than any other movie studio lot in Hollywood. Independent film and the studios In the 1980s and 1990s, as the cost of professional 16mm film equipment decreased, along with the emergence of non-film innovations such as S-VHS and Mini-DV cameras, many young filmmakers began to make films outside the \\"studio system\\". Filmmakers and producers such as Mike Judge, Adam Sandler, Jim Jarmusch, Robert Rodriguez, Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith and Richard Linklater made films that pushed boundaries in ways the studios were then reluctant to do. In response to these films, many distributed by \\"mini-studios\\" like Miramax the \\"majors\\" created their own in- house mini-studios meant to focus on edgier \\"independent\\" content. Focus Features was created by Universal Pictures and Fox Searchlight was created by 20th Century Fox for this purpose.

The trap essentially consists of a cage baited inside with a conspicuously visible live rodent or small bird, with a series of monofilament nooses attached to the surface to snare the legs of a free-flying raptor that attempts to take the bait. The name is derived from the Hindi word used by trappers in India. Modified bal-chatri traps are also used for catching shrikes. History The bal-chatri originated in East India as a trap developed and used by falconers to catch suitable birds of prey to train for use in hunting. It consisted of a small, conical, cane cage, containing live lure birds to attract raptors, and covered with attached horsehair nooses to entangle their feet. The term bal-chatri has been mistranslated as “boy’s umbrella”, or “small umbrella”, after their shape but is correctly translated to \\"hair umbrella\\" and refers to the nooses made of horse-hair anchored to the umbrella-like frame. Bal-chatris continue to be used by falconers, but are also used in ornithological research projects which require the capture of raptors for banding and other procedures, such as blood sampling. Methodology and use Contemporary traps are made of more modern materials, such as wire mesh cages with nooses made of nylon monofilament. The traps vary from 25–50 cm in diameter or length, with the nooses 4–12 cm in diameter. They are normally weighted to prevent them from being carried away by ensnared birds. The live lure, or bait, animals used for the trap are usually rodents such as house mice. The cage may have a double wall, or a removable roof or inner compartment, both to protect the bait animals from the raptors, and to prevent them damaging the nooses by chewing them. The traps are designed to be highly portable and may be deployed opportunistically from a slowly moving vehicle on a roadside when a hawk or falcon is sighted perch-hunting from a pole or utility line along a road. They may also be used near nesting sites in order to trap a breeding pair. Active traps require continuous monitoring. Users require proper training; there are ethical considerations and the need for experience in the use of bal-chatris to avoid harming, and minimizing temporary stress to, the bait animals and the raptors caught.

The station broadcast over channel 46 from December 1952 until May 1954, and held affiliations with all four major networks of the era: NBC, CBS, ABC and DuMont. Background Geographically, New Jersey is sandwiched between New York City and Philadelphia. Between them, the two large cities were granted most of the available VHF channels. The only VHF station assigned to New Jersey was located in Newark, the state's largest city. However, channel 13—WATV, later to become WNTA-TV (and now WNET) -- was programmed as a New York City station. New York City was directly awarded channels 2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11; while Philadelphia was assigned channels 3, 6 and 10. Channel 8 became unavailable as it was given to Lancaster, Pennsylvania's WGAL-TV, and later to WNHC-TV (now WTNH) in New Haven, Connecticut. Around the same time, WDEL-TV in Wilmington, Delaware (later WVUE) moved to channel 12, which the FCC reassigned to Wilmington to replace channel 7. Prior to the opening of the UHF band in 1952, Atlantic City viewers could receive some of the Philadelphia stations. However, they could only be received with very large rooftop antennas, and signals were marginal even under the best conditions. The use of a channel on the newly opened UHF TV band would allow Atlantic City to boast (in the words of one promotion to 1954-era convention-goers) \\"Operation of Atlantic City's own television station, WFPG-TV has begun, and it is expected that many national programs will visit here and originate their shows from 'On the Boardwalk in Atlantic City'.\\"http://www.newjersey.imsasafety.org/Articles/1954/Mar-April/MSE-Mar- Apr%201954c.pdf Construction began on October 30, 1952 – one day after locally-based Neptune Broadcasting Corporation, the owner of WFPG radio, was granted the channel 46 construction permit – and was completed 52 days later, with WFPG's AM broadcasts continuing uninterrupted while the new building and its UHF TV facilities were constructed around the existing radio operation.WFPG-TV Atlantic City, N.J. UHF channel 46, Fred Weber President of WFPG-TV and Blair Thron, RCA Broadcast News, March 1953 - as archived by Atlantic City broadcast engineer Tom McNally While local television receiver vendors were initially hesitant to promote the then largely unproven UHF band, due both to unfamiliarity with the selection of antennae required for the higher frequencies and a lack of factory-installed UHF tuners in many TV sets,WFPG-TV's entry at the UHF Morgue the ability to serve Atlantic City from even a relatively low-powered local station was to provide stronger signals and better-quality images in the local community than could be had at the time through the distant reception of Philadelphia VHF stations. Demise As Philadelphia's VHF stations increased their transmitted signal power to cover a growing market, they were able to regain market share in various outlying communities in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which already had local UHF stations of their own in 1953; along with WFPG-TV, they included WEEU-TV (channel 33) and WHUM-TV (channel 61) in Reading, Pennsylvania, and WSBA-TV (channel 43, now WPMT) in York, Pennsylvania.http://www.mcsittel.com/html/tvg-phl.htm Consequently, WFPG-TV began dropping network shows in its waning months of operation until virtually nothing remained of its network-allocated schedule. As a result, channel 46 went off the air almost unnoticed on May 17, 1954. It is not likely that WFPG- TV would have survived for long in any event, however. Shortly after WFPG-TV went dark, the FCC collapsed Atlantic City into the Philadelphia market. Almost immediately, the Philadelphia stations all secured construction permits to build tall towers in the Roxborough neighborhood, on some of the highest ground in the region. The new towers enabled the Philadelphia stations to provide a clear signal to all of South Jersey, including Atlantic City. While WFPG-TV is no longer on the air,DuMont historical website, Clarke Ingram its radio siblings continued operation. WFPG-FM 96.9 and WFPG (now WPGG) AM 1450 currently operate from studios in NorthfieldNortheast Radio Watch, August 25, 2000 with the original callsign still in active use on FM radio. The WFPG-TV tower also still stands; the facilities built for channel 46 now house the transmitter facilities for WMID 1340 and 99.3 WZBZ radio. Local TV broadcasting did not return to Atlantic City until January 25, 1966, when WCMC-TV (channel 40, now WMGM-TV) signed on as an affiliate of NBC.

In the late 1990s, the Baroness was returned to her roots as a villainous Nazi mastermind,Wonder Woman #131 (volume 2), DC Comics, March 1998. re-imagined by Wonder Woman writer/artist John Byrne as a devotee of the occult who placed her mystical knowledge at the service of the Third Reich. Fictional character biography Pre-Crisis =Golden Age= A member of the noble class in pre-Republican Germany with the rank of Baroness, Paula von Gunther first appeared as a foe of Wonder Woman. She battled the Amazon numerous times as an agent of the Gestapo. Her many crimes include murdering many individuals, keeping a small group of women as personal slaves and torturing them routinely, was for a time the leader of all Gestapo operations in the United States, forcing American female citizens into becoming Nazi spies, attempting to kidnap a Colonel using an invisible ray on a ship while impersonating a high-society lady and stealing Wonder Woman's lasso while trying to steal secrets from security officers. She succeeded in capturing Wonder Woman with it and bound her hand and foot to a wooden pole using it. However Wonder Woman got off the pole and broke open a cage freeing a young boy named Freddy. He untied her hands, but Gunther returned and stopped Wonder Woman by pointing a gun at her back. However Freddy lassoed Gunther, and Wonder Woman stopped her plan. She once tried to monopolize America's milk supply and charge high prices for it so that its people would have weak bones and fall before the stronger-boned Nazis after buying all the milk of a company for five years with seven million dollars. In her first appearance she discovered Wonder Woman’s weakness, which is if her bracelets were chained by a man she becomes as weak as an ordinary woman. While monopolizing milk, her men lassoed Wonder Woman and bound her hand and foot with chains. She was bound to railway tracks, but was able to free herself. Von Gunther was finally captured and revealed that she had worked for the Nazis because they held her daughter Gerta captive. Von Gunther reformed and pledged her loyalty to Wonder Woman after Gerta was rescued. Von Gunther even put her own life in peril to save Wonder Woman from a burning munitions plant, suffering third-degree burns and a horribly scarred face. Von Gunther went to trial, but Wonder Woman acted as her defense and got her off. Murder charges had to be thrown out on double jeopardy, because Paula had previously been tried, convicted...and executed for that crime in the electric chair, but her henchmen had revived her with an electrical machine she had invented after the Doctor gave her body to them (Sensation Comics #7). Von Gunther later escaped by tying up a guard and stealing her uniform, but was later recaptured by Wonder Woman. While in custody, Von Gunther risked her own life to stop a bomb from going off inside a munitions factory, and was burned as a result. Wonder Woman dramatically revealed Paula's scarred face to the jury, which was moved by Paula's heroic self-sacrifice and acquitted her of the remaining espionage and sabotage charges (Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #3). Paula returned to Paradise Island with her former slave girls and her daughter to live and undergo Amazon training. Queen Hippolyte moulded fine features on Paula's face, which the goddess Aphrodite blessed and magically converted into Paula's new face. Paula became the Amazons' chief scientist, spending part of her time on Paradise Island and part aiding Wonder Woman from a hidden underground laboratory beneath Holliday College. Her daughter Gerta also was a scientific savant, although her experiments sometimes led to accidents that needed Wonder Woman's help to fix. Gerta's enlarging ray, for example, was instrumental in helping Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor return to human size after escaping Atomia's atomic world, but also accidentally unleashed the menace of the Bughumans. At one point, her devices revived Wonder Woman, and another time, the Justice Society of America. =Silver Age= Her Earth-1 counterpart differed only slightly, as Baroness Paula von Gunta. The Earth-1 von Gunta appeared in Wonder Woman (vol. I) #163 and 168, before presumably following a similar path as the Earth-2 Paula and moving to Paradise Island to become an adopted Amazon and chief scientist. The Earth-1 Paula was asked to replace Hippolyta as Amazon queen during a coup d'état, which was abruptly ended when the goddess Kore appeared to enlist the Amazons in a battle against the Anti-Monitor during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Post-Crisis Following the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, it was revealed that the Baroness fought Hippolyta during the time-traveling queen's World War II adventures as Wonder Woman. This Von Gunther was a mistress of the occult and became the human host for the evil wandering spirit, Dark Angel. Dark Angel became a dedicated foe of Hippolyta and was inadvertently responsible for the origin of Wonder Girl (Donna Troy). Donna Troy was able to defeat Dark Angel, and at some point Dark Angel separated herself from von Gunther. The Baroness was last seen living among the Amazons. Eventually, it was revealed that Dark Angel was not a mystical spirit but an extant multiversal doppelganger of Donna Troy. DC Rebirth Baroness Paula von Gunther as Warmaster in Wonder Woman Annual, Volume 5 (2019), art by V. Ken Mario, Sandu Florea and Hi-Fi Design After the events of DC Rebirth, Paula von Gunther's origin is altered. As a young girl, Helen was rescued by Wonder Woman from the violent nationalists group known as the Sons of Liberty. She was adopted by Harold and Petra Paul, though Wonder Woman continued to be present in Helen's life. As an adult, Helen joined A.R.G.U.S. However, she soon learned from the supervillain Leviathan that her birth parents were faction leaders of the Sons of Liberty and that her oldest ancestor is Gudra, a valkyrie with a grudge against the Amazons of Themyscira after they struck down her sisters on a supposed mission of peace. Helen, realizing Wonder Woman had lied to her, returned to her true name of Paula von Gunther and adopted the codename Warmaster.Wonder Woman Annual #3 (2019) As Warmaster, Paula began to assemble a group of female supervillains who have faced Wonder Woman in the past. She started with Devastation, who had been fighting with the hero Firebrand.Wonder Woman #751 (2020) The pair made their headquarters in Norway, and Warmaster revealed to Devastation that when she touched the Spear of Gudra, she heard the voices of her valkyrie ancestors who demanded Warmaster destroy the amazons who had betrayed them.Wonder Woman #752 (2020) Warmaster later traveled to Canada and recruited Armageddon, a descendant of ogres that had previously fought Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman #753 (2020) Lastly, Warmaster released Genocide from her tomb deep within a cave near the Tyrrhenian Sea.Wonder Woman #754 (2020) While Devastation and Armageddon battled Donna Troy, Warmaster summoned Wonder Woman to her base in Norway. There, she battled Wonder Woman and managed to pierce the superheroine's shoulder with the Spear of Gudra. She threatened to have Genocide kill all the heroes guarding the portal to Themyscira unless Wonder Woman opened it and allowed her inside.Wonder Woman #755 (2020) Powers and abilities Pre-Crisis, Paula von Gunther had (after receiving training) standard Amazon powers, such as superhuman strength capable of breaking chains and leaping great heights, speed and stamina enough to deflect bullets and other projectiles from her Amazon Bracelets. She was also a skilled hand-to- hand combatant. Post-Crisis, von Gunther was empowered when possessed by Dark Angel, who had vast powers and was able to perform a variety of feats including mind control, altering her size, teleportation and altering the time stream. Post-Rebirth, Helen Paul is a highly decorated A.R.G.U.S. Agent whom graduated at the top of her class early on in life, being an avid spy and combatant at the age of 16.Wonder Woman Annual #3 (2019) After having acquired the spear of Gudra; her great Valkyrie ancestor, she would gain vast empowerment through the heretical memory of all amongst the Von Gunther line whom fought against the Amazons in the past.Wonder Woman #752 (2020) She has also equipped herself with a vast assortment of secretive spy networking paraphernalia pinched by the Leviathan organization, acquired from its time during a globe spanning secret service agency annexation.

Life and times Ocaña was born and raised in the western Buenos Aires suburb of San Justo in 1960. Raised without her father, she lost her mother to an accident at age five and was taken in by her maternal grandparents, both immigrants from Spain. Ocaña received her primary education at the Santa Rosa de Lima School, an institution maintained by Dominican nuns. She was transferred to the San Justo Secondary School system and enrolled at the University of Buenos Aires in 1978, where she graduated with a degree in Political Science in 1983. Ocaña became affiliated with the Justicialist Party and found work in the private sector, managing a number of import-export businesses in the San Justo area. Ocaña became disaffected from the Justicialist Party following President Carlos Menem's unexpected adoption of free market policies after taking office and, in 1993, she aligned herself with the eight congressmen who had left the party to form the center-left Frente Grande. An adviser to Buenos Aires Province Congressman \\"Chacho\\" Álvarez (the party's leader), she was elected to the Argentine Lower House of Congress as a member of the Frente Grande's successor, FrePaSo, on the Alliance ticket that brought Álvarez to the office of Vice President in 1999. Ocaña earned renown for her work in the Money Laundering and Capital flight Subcommittee in Congress, where in 2001 she led investigations into businessman Emir Yoma and Córdoba Province Vice Governor Germán Kammerath, among others. President Fernando de la Rúa's resignation in December and the attendant crisis dissolved the Alliance, whereby Ocaña joined fellow Congresswoman Elisa Carrió's ARI, a new center-left christian democratic party.

Although geodeulji was originally only allowed for yangban women (nobility) to use, since about 1900, it began to be used by commoners who could not have a ceremonial clothing like hwarot or wonsam. They put it on their outer jeogori (a short jacket) for their wedding ceremony to represent the robe as a formal attire. Geudeulji is inwardly sewn at the edge of the sleeves and then is turned outwardly. Even though geodeulji was originally used to cover hands, it prevents the edge of the sleeves from getting dirty, so wearers used to change only geodeulji. In addition, hansam (한삼), fabric extension attached to the sleeves of wonsam or hwarot is sometimes called geudeulji as well, because the two are similar in usage. However, hansam can cover thoroughly hands unlike geudeulji.

Mark Shavlik left his role as CEO when Shavlik Technologies was acquired by VMware in May 2011, then held the position of Vice President and General Manager at VMware until March 2013. In April 2013, LANDESK purchased the Shavlik business unit and all rights to the Shavlik products from VMware. During the same period, LANDESK announced a partnership that made VMware an Alliance Partner.LANDesk Acquires Shavlik from VMware Official Announcement In 2017 LANDESK merged with HEAT Software created a new IT Software company called Ivanti. Today, while the Shavlik name has been retired, the same Shavlik products are vital to the Ivanti security portfolio.  History  Prior to the acceptance of Windows NT as a legitimate, enterprise operating system in the late 1990s, most enterprise software was written for Unix or some other mainframe operating system. Shavlik's roots were in providing consulting services to help organizations make the leap to Microsoft OS's and contributed to them delivering products on NT. Shavlik later extended its services business into software security consulting, primarily with businesses in highly regulated industries such as banking and healthcare. The services centered on providing a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) to perform security audits and penetration testing. In the early 2000s the failure to keep software up-to-date by applying patches was a common flag on audits. One of the central challenges in addressing the problem was that companies did not have an easy way to determine which machines were out of date and they did not have a methodology to deploy updates. During this era, Microsoft wrestled with addressing this issue internally. They wanted a tool to detect which NT servers in a large NT server environment were missing patches so \\"hot fixes\\" (see Hotfix) could be installed on those machines. However, because these NT servers were critical to operations, Microsoft required that this process be completed without installing any extra software, such as an agent, on the servers. In an effort to address the \\"hot fix\\"issue, Shavlik built the first agentless patch scanner for Windows NT.HFNetChk: Microsoft's New Hotfix Tool News Coverage The product was named HFNetChk (the acronym designating HotFix Network Check). The HFNetChk release was followed by another partnership wherein Shavlik helped build the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA). This tool did minimal patch scanning along with some basic OS configuration checks. It was delivered by Microsoft as part of the Windows 2000 Server Toolkit. HFNetChk Pro 3.0, which was never released externally, introduced the ability to not only scan for missing patches but also to deploy those patches. This eliminated the need for an IT administrator to apply patches manually. In 2003, Shavlik brought HFNetChk to market for the first time. Version 4 featured a Visual Basic \\"web friendly\\" user interface. Previous versions of HFNetChk were operated via a command line interface. Patch Management In January 2003, the SQL slammer worm exploited a vulnerability in SQL Server that allowed a denial of service and slowed traffic on many internet hosts to a crawl. The worm went viral affecting 75,000 systems in the first ten minutes. Microsoft had made a patch available six months prior indicating that a failure to patch led to the widespread, security breach, not the vulnerability itself.SQL Slammer: Hot it Works and How to Prevent It News Coverage Shavlik's HFNetChk was the first product in the market that could scan for and deploy missing patches on Windows machines. In the aftermath of the SQL Slammer worm and after a series of other highly publicized exploits hit in 2003/2004, Shavlik made the decision to move away from consulting and to fully invest in software development for patch management products. Shavlik Protect Shavlik added standalone and integrated anti-virus capabilities to version 5 of HFNetChk and changed the product name to HFNetChk Protect, eventually dropping HFNetChk.Shavlik Products Page Company Website During the Version 6 timeframe, Protect introduced the capability to patch offline virtual machines and VM templates. This project was the first in a series of partnerships Shavlik entered into with VMware, and the capability meant that Protect could agentlessly patch machines in both physical and virtual environments. With Version 7 and its various point releases, a new user interface was introduced as well as physical and virtual asset inventory. Agent support was integrated into Protect and was no longer offered as a separately licensed product. Shavlik also shifted more of its detection logic out of Protect and into the content. Version 8 of Protect fixed many stability issues. Due to a number of customer complaints, Shavlik focused on making the product more stable. Version 9 introduced hypervisor patching for VMware implementations as well as the ability to patch off-network machines via the cloud. Microsoft Collaboration Shavlik's technological advancements have been significant enough to attract attention from Microsoft, resulting in cooperative efforts between the two companies and the development of the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), which is based on Shavlik's HFNetChk (the acronym designating HotFix Network Checker) released in 2001.ServerWatch Windows Patch Management, Shavlik Technologies This technology has evolved, but is still the core technology in the current product offerings and has been licensed by multiple OEM partners to provide patch management capabilities to a variety of IT management solutions with a combined install base of millions of users across the globe.Info Security Products Guide Helping Organizations Stay Ahead of Security Breaches and Challenges In the late 2000s, the industry saw applications being exploited by hackers shift from Microsoft OS and other Microsoft applications to third-party applications like Java, Adobe, music players, and non-Microsoft internet browsers. During this time, products like Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) provided Windows patch capabilities via the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS); however, it didn't (and still doesn't) patch third-party products. According to Global Analyst Firm Gartner, this left administrators with limited choices: don't patch third-party products leaving the network at risk, author and test a custom patch each time a third-party product requires an update, or deploy the patches manually to each affected machine.Gartner Blog Post, May 6, 2013 Patch Management Not a Solved Problem In April 2010, Shavlik released SCUPdates – a catalog of patch content that automated the process of building third-party patches and delivering them to Windows clients via an integration with Microsoft System Center Updates Publisher (SCUP) and SCCM. In tandem with the initial SCUPdates release, Microsoft and Shavlik also announced Shavlik's inclusion into the Microsoft System Center Alliance.Satellite Spotlight, April 15, 2010 Shavlik Technologies Joins Microsoft System Center Alliance Patch Management to the Cloud In 2010 Shavlik released IT.Shavlik which provided a web-based front-end to the traditional Shavlik toolkit of asset inventory, patch scanning, and patch deployment. This Software as a Service (SaaS) application simplified the workflow for inventory and systems patching than was possible with the on-premises, Protect solution. In early 2009, Shavlik formed an OEM partnership with VMware to build a cloud-based application designed to help IT administrators in smaller businesses deploy a virtual environment. VMware Go (vGo) was intended to be an \\"onramp to virtualization,\\" serving smaller customers until they were ready to upgrade to the more sophisticated vCenter suite. vGo was originally brought to market as a free- use cloud-based product. VMware and Shavlik invested heavily in vGo, and the product was expanded to include asset inventory, patch scanning, and an IT advisor recommendation engine. Later in attempts to monetize vGo's services, a paid version called VMware Go Pro introduced patch deployment. This led to the migration of users from IT.Shavlik to VMware Go. Acquisition History VMware's interest in vGo as well as the virtual infrastructure patching capabilities within Protect led to its acquisition of Shavlik Technologies in May 2011. The terms of the acquisition were not publicly disclosed.VMware to Acquire Shavlik Technologies, May 16, 2011 Official VMware Release In January 2013, VMware announced its intent to \\"sharpen its focus\\" on the software- defined data center and hybrid cloud services.Bloodiest Tech Industry Layoffs of 2013 So Far News Coverage As part of this realignment, VMware sought to sell off products that weren't contributing to its core business such as its SlideRocket presentation software and other \\"non-key cloud and virtualization technologies.\\" VMware Announces Mass Layoffs After Positive Earnings Report News Coverage The Shavlik product line found itself on that list. In April 2013, LANDesk Software purchased the Shavlik business unit and all rights to the Shavlik products from VMware. At the same time LANDesk announced a partnership which added VMware to LANDesk's list of Alliance Partners.LANDesk Acquires Shavlik from VMware, April 9, 2013 Official LANDesk Release Shavlik's move to LANDesk triggered new investment in Shavlik Patch for Microsoft System Center (formerly SCUPdates) as well as other products that enhance the experience for companies using SCCM. In early 2017, Clearlake Capital Group acquired LANDesk and Shavlik, along with Heat Software, Appsense and Wavelink; the combined company uses a new corporate name and product brand, Ivanti.Shavlik is now Ivanti, March 28, 2017 Press Release reported in ITWebRealize value in minutes, not months ivanti company page References Further reading #Battening the patches: Shavlik Technologies of Roseville has built a niche as one of the nation's leading testers and managers of computer security...

It has been inhabited for over 5000 years. The remains of some of its early residents are still in existence, in a mound just west of the village, which can be clearly seen from the Emly/Tipperary road. It is a civil parish in the barony of Clanwilliam. It is also one half of the 'Lattin and Cullen' parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly. It is located on the R515 regional road between the towns of Emly and Tipperary.Google Maps Amenities and features The village comprises a church, two cemeteries and two pubs. On the sports grounds there is a hall for meetings and for amateur shows (school concerts, Scór competitions etc.). Although in recent years the GAA have seemed to take over this. The cemetery is located approximately 100 metres west of the church. One pub is on the corner opposite the cemetery's entrance. The other is located on the other side of the village, on the road leading to Tipperary town. Lattin is surrounded by rich pasture land, much of which is used for dairy farming. It is situated in an area of south Tipperary known as the Golden Vale, an area in which the land is particularly suitable for grass growing and dairy farming. Lattin's local GAA club, known as Lattin-Cullen, is affiliated to the West Division Board of Tipperary GAA. The club is historically associated with Gaelic football. The club's best known player, however, is Nicky English of Cullen village, who is better known for his association with the sport of hurling.

The operation began in response to United Nations Security Council Resolution 781, which established a ban on the use of military aircraft in Bosnian airspace, and requested the aid of member states in monitoring compliance. Beginning on October 16, 1992, NATO monitored violations of the no-fly zone using E-3 Sentry NAEW aircraft based in Germany, Italy, Greece, and the United Kingdom. The operation documented more than 500 violations of the no-fly zone by April 1993. In response to this high volume of unauthorized flights, the Security Council passed Resolution 816, which authorized NATO to enforce the no-fly zone, and engage violators. In response, NATO deactivated Sky Monitor on April 12, 1993, transferring its forces to the newly established Operation Deny Flight. Background On September 25, 1991, at the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 713, which established \\"a general and complete embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Yugoslavia\\", with the goal of reducing violence and bloodshed throughout the country. In May, the Security Council reaffirmed the embargo in Resolution 757, and added a provision for a naval force to monitor compliance with the embargo. In resolution 757, the Council also called on states to \\"deny permission to any aircraft to take off, land in or overfly their territory if it is destined to land in or had taken off from the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\", setting the precedent for later anti-air measures. In response to resolution 757, NATO began to perform its first operations on behalf of the United Nations on July 16, 1992 with Operation Maritime Monitor, which monitored violations of Security Council Resolutions by ships. As a part of Maritime Monitor, NATO dispatched E-3 Sentry airborne early warning aircraft to the region to monitor sea traffic. These aircraft flew more than 200 missions over the course of the operation. On October 9, 1992, the Security Council passed resolution 781. In the resolution, the Security Council expressed concern about the use of aircraft by the belligerents in the War in Bosnia and established a formal \\"ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\". It also called upon member states to help the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in monitoring \\"compliance with the ban on military flights\\". Shortly thereafter, on October 15, NATO aircraft operating under Maritime Monitor began monitoring flights over Bosnia for the UN. The essential goal of this mission was to conduct surveillance in order to determine whether or not the various parties in the conflict were respecting the UN no-fly zone. The next day, October 16, Operation Sky Monitor officially began when NATO planes expanded their monitoring with flight paths over the Adriatic. Operation During Operation Sky Monitor, aircraft operated in two \\"orbits\\", one over the Adriatic established on October 16, and a second one over Hungary, established with the permission of the Hungarian government on October 31. Both of these orbits operated 24 hours a day, providing constant surveillance of Bosnian airspace. The first flight over Hungary on October 31 was an important milestone in NATO history as it was the \\"first operational mission in a former Warsaw Pact nation\\" for the alliance. Even more significantly, Hungary agreed that if a NATO aircraft were attacked in its airspace, the Hungarian Air Force would provide support with Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighters. This support never became necessary, but it marked another important milestone, actual military cooperation between NATO and the former Warsaw Pact. The monitoring aircraft of Sky Monitor were initially drawn from the NATO Airborne Early Warning squadron based at NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen in Germany, but Aviano Air Base in Italy, Preveza in Greece, and Trapani in Italy were all used as forward operating bases. As the operation expanded, the British No. 8 Squadron RAF and the French E-3F squadron at Avord Air Base were also used. All of these NATO forces fell under the authority of Allied Forces Southern Europe, commanded by Admiral Jeremy Boorda of the United States Navy. Eleven NATO countries provided personnel or aircraft for the operation: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey, and the United States. The rules of engagement for Sky Monitor were very restrictive. Because the purpose of the operation was to monitor, rather than prevent, unauthorized flights, participating aircraft were only authorized to use force in self-defense. Furthermore, under the rules of engagement, NATO forces were directed to take evasive action if attacked rather than engage an opponent if at all possible. As a result of the strict rules of engagement, no NATO forces were engaged in combat during Operation Sky Monitor. Sky Monitor documented many violations of the no-fly zone, the most significant of which came in March 1993, when Serb aircraft bombed two Muslim villages. This violation, the first \\"combat violation\\" of the no-fly zone, led to calls for NATO to actively enforce the zone, rather than just monitoring compliance. Results At the beginning of April 1993, NATO had documented more than 500 violations of the no-fly zone over Bosnia, including violations from all sides in the conflict. Out of these numerous violations, however, NATO documented only one that it considered a \\"combat mission\\". Although most of the violations were not combat missions, NATO had decided even before the end of Sky Monitor that the UN ban was ineffective. On December 18, 1992, the NATO members voted to enforce the no-fly zone with military force if requested by the United Nations. This escalation of NATO involvement also gained the crucial backing of US President-elect Bill Clinton in December, when he told the press that he had \\"been in favor of enforcing the no-fly zone for some time.\\" A US Air Force F-15C takes off on a sortie to enforce the no-fly zone during Operation Deny Flight The UN called for NATO to use force in response to the \\"blatant violations of the ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina\\" with Security Council Resolution 816 on March 31, 1993. The resolution authorized UN member states to \\"take all necessary measures\\" in order \\"to ensure compliance\\" with the no-fly zone. As a result of this new resolution, NATO deactivated Sky Monitor, and began Operation Deny Flight on April 12, 1993. Under Deny Flight, NATO forces continued to monitor and document unauthorized flights, but they were also authorized to enforce the zone and engage violators if necessary. Operation Sky Monitor was the first of many NATO air operations in the Balkans, including the more significant Operation Deliberate Force and Operation Allied Force. Sky Monitor was also NATO's first out of area air operation, and one of its first collaborative missions with the United Nations. Thus, it set the precedent for future NATO- UN cooperation, based on a model where NATO forces would use their superior technical expertise to assist the UN in pursuing its broader mission. Sky Monitor also affected military policy, as it proved the utility of the E-3 Sentry, NATO's principal aircraft in the operation, for monitoring missions under a wide variety of circumstances. Thus, the E-3 became an important part of NATO's planning for later operations.

In 1843, this Spanish grant was confirmed by Mexican Governor Manuel Micheltorena.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco Rincón, translated from the Spanish, means corner or nook, and Bueyes are oxen or steer. Geography The grant was, for the most part, diamond-shaped, with the exception of the southeast corner extending over one mile deeper than the other three corners. It was relatively small for a Spanish concession at that time and it was surrounded on all sides by five different ranchos. To the east there were two: Rancho Las Cienegas and Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera. On the west, there was Rancho La Ballona. Bordering the northwest boundary was Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres and to the northeast there was Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas.Map of old Spanish and Mexican ranchos in Los Angeles County1900 USGS topographic mapRincón de Los Bueyes encompasses present day Cheviot Hills, Rancho Park, the northeast extension of Culver City, and a small section of Baldwin Hills with Ballona Creek. History Governor Vicente de Sola granted a concession to Bernardo Higuera (1790–1837) and Cornelio Lopez (born 1792) in 1821. Lopez soon quarreled with Higuera, leaving the latter in possession. Bernardo Higuera was the son of Joaquin Higuera, the alcalde of the Pueblo de Los Angeles in 1800. In 1834 Bernardo Higuera, and his wife, Maria del Rosario Palomares (born 1792), moved to Los Angeles, leaving his brothers Mariano (baptized 23 July 1804 Mission, San Gabriel) and Policarpio (baptized 27 January 1799, same mission) to run the ranch. Bernardo Higuera bequeathed his Rancho Rincón de los Bueyes to his two sons, Francisco and Secundino. Rancho Rincón de los Bueyes With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican–American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Francisco and Secundino Higuera filed their claim for Rancho Rincón de los Bueyes with the Public Land Commission in 1852. Their claim was rejected by the Commission in 1854, but upheld by the District Court in 1861. The grant was patented to Francisco and Secundino Higuera in 1872.

Its history is not completely dated but it is believed that it was built during the early rule of Slave dynasty of India. The Munger town where the fort is situated was under the control of Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi (1325-1351 CE). The fort has two prominent hills called the Karnachaura or Karanchaura, and the other a built up rectangular mound deduced to be the location of a citadel of the fort with historical links. The Fort had a succession of Muslim rulers (Khaljis, Tughlaqs, Lodis, Nawabs of Bengal, followed by Mughal rulers, till it was finally acceded to the British by Mir Quasim (1760–72), after unseating his father-in-aw Mīr Jafar on the grounds of old age, for a monetary reward negotiated by Vansittart. This deal involved payment by the East India Company's merchants of an ad valorem duty of 9 percent, against an Indian merchant’s duty of 40%. The fort became a place of considerable importance to the British in Bengal till 1947 (India'a independence). The fort houses a number of religious and historic monuments such as the Tomb of Pir Shah Nufa (died 1497), Palace of Shah Suja, Tomb of Mulla Muhammad Said (died 1704 CE), the Kashtaharini Ghat on the Ganges River, Chandisthana (an ancient temple) and an 18th century British cemetery. In recent times, a famous School of Yoga was established here. Etymology The etymology of the word Munger prefixed to the fort and to the town also called by the same name is Mudgagiri with links to the Mahbharata epic. A copper plate inscription of Devapala alludes to Munger. Another version is that the name could have derived from either sage Mudgala or Maudgalyayana, a disciple of Buddha. A further explanation by General Cunnigham is that it could have been named after the Mundas, its earliest inhabitants. C.E.A. Oldham gives a version that it was a ‘‘Munigriha’’ (the hermitage of a saint Muni). History The Fort's history has been traced from 1330 AD onwards, under the rule of Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. But its ancient history, as a town, mostly ruled by Hindu kings, is initially traced from a stone inscription to Chandra Gupta Maurya (4th century BC), (after whom it was initially called Gupta Garhis) and later dated to the kingdom of Anga, the capital of which was at Champa near Bhagalpur, and the Pala kings in the 9th century AD. ;Medieval period Munger, which was under the rule of the Karnataka dynasty of Mithila, was taken over by Bhaktiyar Khalji in 1225 AD and subsequently under the Khalji ruler, Gyasuddin Khalji. ;Muhammadan rule For a brief period, it came under the control of Sultan of Bengal between 1301 CE and 1322 CE, following a peace treaty with Khaljis. This was followed by annexation of the area to Delhi by Muhammad bin Tughluq, during 1342 CE. Inscriptions reveal that repairs were carried out to the fort during the reign of Prince Danyal of Bengal (son of Bahlol Lodi) who held the post of Governor of Bihar, after the defeat of Jampur rulers by the Sultan of Bengal. It is also stated that Prince Danyal of Bengal built the shrine of Sufi saint Shah Nafah within the south gate of the fort, in 1497 AD. ;Suri rule In 1534 CE, in a battle which took place in the plains of Surajgarha, the formidable army of Ibrahim Khan of Munger was defeated and he was killed by Sher Shah Suri who established the Suri Empire. Thus, the fort came under Sher Shah Suri's overlordship (1486 - May 22, 1545). In the subsequent war that took place between Sher Shah and Humayun, the Mughal Emperor, Munger was the centre of battle between the Afghan and the Mughals. Sher Shah won and the Mughal rule was substituted by Afghan rule. In 1590, the importance of the fort was enhanced by making it the headquarters of Bihar army of the rulers of Gaur under their general named Kutub Khan. Nasrat Shah had succeeded Hussain Shah in Bengal and his brother- in-law, Makhdun Alam, was given control of the Munger fort, which he, in turn, passed on to his general Kutub Khan. ;Mughal rule From the time of the reign of Akbar in the late 16th century, Monghyr was controlled by the Mughal Emperors. Raja Todar Mal, Minister in the Mughal empire had camped at this fort when he was deputed to put down the rebel forces of Bengal. He substantially refurbished the fortifications of the fort. After a series of intriguing changes in the governorship of Munger Shah Shuja, the second son of Shah Jahan, the Mughal Emperor and Aurangzeb's brother, had fled to this place to escape persecution, during his fight with his brothers for power. He was made governor of the region after protracted negotiations with his brothers Dara Shikoh, Murad and Aurangzeb, and under the treaty of 1658 Munger was added to Shuja's reign. Shuja built a palace on the west side of the fort, which has been described as \\" very large house where the king (Suja) lived, walled next to the river, for about one and half Kos with bricks and stones, with a wall fifteen yards high\\". However, in 1745, Mustafa Khan, a rebel leader under General Alivardi Khan took control of the fort when its defenses had weakened. After a few days of stay in the fort, he continued his campaign towards Patna with lots of guns and ammunition taken from the fort. In the 4th Maratha war of 1744, the Maratha army had raided through Bihar and Munger. Jean Law, the French adventurer and partisan of Siraj ud-Daulah (1733 – July 2, 1757), the last independent Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa was running away after the Battle of Plassey. In July 1757, the British attempted an attack on the fort. Eyre Coote, the British officer (heading the British force) reached Munger in pursuit of Jean Low. But he could not enter the well- fortified fort. He did not dare to attack the fort because the fort garrison had lined up \\"the ramparts with their matches held near the cannons.\\" But the Governor of the fort provided him boats. In February 1760, Major Caillaud of the Nawab of Bengal and his supporters defeated the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II (1728–1806). The Emperor and his army moved out not only from the fort but also from the district. With this victory, the rule of Mir Qasim, the Nawab of Bengal began with Johan Stables, in charge of Munger fort, launching a successful attack on the Raja of Kharagpur who had opposed the Nawab of Bengal. ;Nawab of Bengal's rule Monghyr was thus occupied by Mir Qasim Ali, the Nawab of Bengal (from 1760 to 1764). In 1763, Quasim shifted his capital from Murshidabad to Munger. His new appointee General Gurgin Khan from Isfahan patterned the Bengal Army on the lines of the British forces. At this fort, a factory for arsenal, for manufacturing of fire-arms was established. This tradition has continued to this day; several hundred families who have specialized in the manufacture of guns are continuing with this old tradition. He further added to the fortifications and also built palaces in the fort. Mir Quasim came to be known as a just ruler (he tried to eliminate corruption and injustice) but was also feared by his opponents as a fierce and ruthless warrior. He was also known for encouraging culture and had many scholars in his court. But all this ended soon as he had serious differences on trade and other administrative practices with the British. Mir Qasim later had to use the fort as a base for waging war against the British. But he was defeated in 1764. Later, he turned out to be a poor looser as he disgraced himself by committing serious atrocities on his own people in Munger fort and also in Patna, and also on the English army and other personnel who were captured in Patna. His criminal atrocities in Patna are known in the historical annals as the ‘Massacre of Patna’. Subsequently, the fort lost its glory. Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General, in British India, had built a country house here. ;British rule History also records a \\"White Mutiny\\" by disgruntled officers of the East India Company (who controlled the fort) in the precincts of the Munger Fort, which was put down in 1766 by Lord Clive. The mutiny broke out over the reduction of an extra monthly payment called bhatta to soldiers on active duty. After the suppression of the mutiny, a small garrison was thereafter stationed at the fort. Over the years, the maintenance of the fort was neglected. Structure Under the Mughal rule, the fort was substantially expanded as a strong military fortification. The fort was an impressive structure with massive gates, one of which had been a strong fortification with square towers, with a deep moat. The moat was in width, surrounding the land side of the fort, thus making it strategically formidable. It opens to the Ganges river (which is wide here, but crossed only by boats) at either end thus enhancing the fort's security. The fort is spread over an area of over rocky hills with a peripheral length of. The fort has thick inner walls while the outer walls are thick forming the fortification, which is thick. The intervening space of between the inner and outer walls is filled with earth. The Ganges river hugs the fort walls on the west and partly in the north. On the landward side, there is a wide moat, which acts as a defense to the fortifications. There are four entry gates, within the octagonal fortress, with ramparts. The main gateway, called the Lal Darwaza, is still in good shape, even though the rest of the fort is mostly in ruins. This gate has a carved stone, which is said to belong to a Hindu or a Buddhist structure. Other monuments in the fort A view within the fort of Munger The famous monuments located within the fort are: ;Tomb of Pir Shah Nufa Pir Shah Nufa, originally of Persin origin, was a Sufi saint who was sent to Munger by his guru Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer. His tomb dating his death to A.H. 596 (1177 AD) is located near a rampart in the fort close to the southern gate. It was built over an area of square with retaining walls supporting all round, on a high heap of earth (conjectured to be ruins of former Hindu or Buddhist structure). The carved stones of these ancient temples were pitted by holes and depressions, with the belief that such disfiguring would cure certain diseases of children. The domed tomb chamber, square with circular turrets, also encloses a prayer room and a restroom. Some ruins of ancient Hindu temples are also seen in the vicinity of this tomb. ;Palace of Shah Shuja The old Shuja palace buildings within the Munger Fort Though locally known as the 'Palace of Shuja', the Mughal Prince, it is inferred to have been built earlier by Nawab Mir Qasim Ali, who also ruled from Munger. The palace is bounded by high rise walls on three sides and the Ganges river on the west side. As in any palace of the Mughals, it consisted of a Khas Mahal or 'Zanana Palace', the 'Diwane-I-Am' or Public Audience Hall and the Tope-Khana or Armoury (made of thick walls) (now a dormitory). There was also a mosque on the west side of the palace, now in ruins, but used as storehouse. There was a Turkish bath (hammam) and a dressing room to the west of the present day jailer's office. An interesting feature noted below the floor of the mosque is a dry well or pit of depth, which leads to several tunnels running in different directions. The well was, in earlier times, connected to the river through an opening, which has since been shored up. The Khas Mahal of the palace and the Public Audience Hall inside the fort, which are now seen mostly in ruins, are used as a jail and a school for the convicts. ;Tomb of Mulla Muhammed Said Tomb of Mullah Mohammed Said was situated on the bastion at the south-west of the fort, but has since been removed. Mulla Mohammed Said hailing from Mazandran near the Caspian Sea, was a Persian poet (under the nom-de-plume of Ashraf). He was employed by Emperor Aurangzeb to tutor his daughter Zebunnisa Begum. He was also under the employment of Azim Shah, grandson of Aurangzeb, and who was the viceroy of Bihar. The Mullah, while on his way from Bengal to Mecca, died at Munger fort in 1704 and his tomb existed inside the fort. ;The Kashtaharini Ghat on the Ganges River front view of Munger with the ghats The Ganges river that flows in front of Munger fort takes a turn in its flow direction towards the north ('Uttara vahini' in Sanskrit means: \\"north flowing\\"). At this location, a ghat (stepped approach to the river edge from the high bank built in stones) was constructed, which has a legend linked to it. An inscription at Kannauj records that Govind Chandra of Kannauj, a Gahadvala King, granted land on the bank of the river to build a ghat, after bathing in the Ganges river at Mudgagiri (Munger) on the occasion of the Hindu festival known as Akshaya Tritiya. There are several antiquities that have been unearthed at this ghat such as: an inscription of about the 10th century AD on the wall of the gateway that refers to king Bhagiratha and the construction of a Shiva temple; discovery of carvings and sculptures by archaeologist Bloch in 1903; an inscribed image of Dhyani Buddha (Buddha in meditation pose) describing the Buddhist doctrine; preserved now in the Indian Museum at Kolkata). Hence, this location is venerated by the Hindus. ;Chandisthana Chandisthana (meaning: place of goddess Chandi) is the location of a shrine, which is a village deity of goddess Chandi (Chandi or Caṇḍīika is the name by which the Supreme Goddess is referred to in Devi Mahatmya). It is considered as one of the 64 shakti peethas (a tantric cultural centre) in India. It is depicted in the form of a hole in a rock dated to the rule of king Karna Vikrama. The conjecture that it could be part of an ancient temple that existed here is yet to be established by archeologists by exploration of the area. ;Karnachaura A natural rocky hillock dated to the ancient Raja Karna is named after him as the 'Karnachaura' or 'Karanchaura' or 'Karan Chabutara' (meaning: slab of Raja Karan). It is the highest point in the fort. Since the location commands a fine view of the surroundings, Raja Karan (he was a contemporary of Vikramaditya, the famous king of India) had built a house on the hill, which was later converted by the British to a saluting battery. In 1766, this base on the hill was crucial in subduing rebellion by some European officers of the garrison. Further refurbishing of the fort occurred during General Goddard's time when it was converted as the large residence (as it exists now) of the Commanding Officer of the British garrison. This building was later under the ownership of Maharaja of Vizianagram and then by the Raja of Murshidabad. Since 1978, it is under the ownership of the Bihar School of Yoga. Swami Satyananda Saraswati founder of the Yoga School has renamed it as 'Ganga Darshan'. The Yoga School is now renowned as a world centre for modern yogic/tantric renaissance. An old platform near the hill, in front of the bungalow, is also linked to the period of King Karna and his wife. ;Rectangular mound People walking about within the fort near Shuja palace grounds The second famous rock hillock (no specific name is given to this) within the fort is, in fact, an artificial rectangular raised platform where a citadel of the fort probably existed in the past. An old building called as 'Damdama Kothi' ('kothi' means \\"house\\"), conjectured to have been built by Muslim rulers or even earlier Hindu kings that existed here, was destroyed by the British to build the 'Collector's Bangalow'. When this strong Kothi (a masonry structure) was demolished by blasting, underground rooms were found. In addition, in a well in the compound of the bungalow, two arched passages were found; one lead to the house and the other in an opposite direction to the Shuja palace (now a prison). Stone carvings and sculptures were seen in exposed masonry of the Kothi, during Buchanan's archaeological explorations. ;Bihar School of Yoga The Bihar School of Yoga founded by Swami Satyananda Saraswati in 1964 to impart traditional yoga teachings to the world is headquartered inside the Munger fort. Apart from providing spiritual instruction to candidates, the school undertakes yoga projects and medical research in association with other agencies. It is the World's first Yoga University and a deemed university. It attracts students from all over the world. Around 400 Australians, Americans and others register for the yoga course every year, with this figure rising continuously. Visitor information Munger fort and the Munger town are well connected by road, rail and air communications through Patna, the capital city of Bihar. Patna is connected by air to all major cities in India. It has a very good network of rail and road links with all major cities in the country. The road distance from Patna to Munger is . The Ganges river, which has been declared as the National Waterway 1 flows to the south bank of the Munger town. It extends from Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh to Kolkata in West Bengal. En route, the towns covered are Bhagalpur, Munger, Patna and Buxar. A tourist cruise service authorised under a Memorandum of understanding with Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has been launched recently to cover this navigational route to visit several tourist destinations, including Munger fort.

Floods of 2003 and 2006  The floods of 2003 and 2006 actually helped the falls a lot because it removed most of the debris that previously lined the creek below the falls. Once again, due to the strong bedrock the falls flow over, the falls were not altered much.

The old fort in the plains, which existed even before the Chero dynasty, was built by the King of Raksel dynasty. These are two large forts located deep in the forests of Palamu on Sher Shah Suri path near Daltonganj. The original fort in the plains and the other on an adjoining hill are attributed to the kings of the Chero dynasty. The fort in the plains had defences on three sides and three main gates. The New fort was constructed by Raja Medini Ray. The architecture is Islamic in style, which reflects Daud Khan’s conquest. Geography The Palamu Kila are two ruined forts located around south east of the city of Daltonganj in the Indian state of Jharkhand. These are large forts located deep in the forests of Palamu near Daltonganj The first fort (old fort) is in the plains and the second fort (new fort)is in an adjoining hill, and both overlook the meandering Auranga River (also known as Ornaga River ) in Palamu. The river looks like jagged teeth due to extensive rock exposures in the bed of the river which may perhaps be the source of the name 'Palamau', meaning the \\"place of the fanged river.\\" The forts are in a densely forested area of the Betla National Park. The forts are close to each other and lie about from Daltonganj. History The old fort in the plains, which existed even before the Chero dynasty, was built by the King of Raksel Rajput Dynasty. However, it was during the reign of King Medini Ray (also spelled Medini Rai), who ruled for thirteen years from 1658 to 1674 in Palamau. The old fort was rebuilt into a defensive structure. Ray was a Chero tribal king. His rule extended to areas in South Gaya and Hazaribagh. He attacked Doisa now known as Navratangarh ( from Ranchi) and defeated the Nagvanshi Raja Raghunath Shah. With war bounty he constructed the lower fort close to Satbarwa, and this fort became famous in the history of the district. The Mughals, during the reign of Emperor Akbar, under the command of Raja Man Singh, invaded in 1574, but subsequently his contingent at Palamau was defeated in 1605 following the death of Akbar. During the reign of jahangir, the Subedar of Patna and Palamau tried to impose a tribute on the Raksel rulers which they refused to pay. This resulted in three attacks in series by the Mughals. The rulers of Raksel Rajput Dynasty in 1613 CE were invaded by the Chero under Bhagwant Rai with the aid of Rajput chiefs, the ancestors of The Thakurais of Ranka and Chainpur. When the Raksel Raja Man Singh then ruling Palamu was out of capital Bhagwant Rai seized power. On hearing this news Raja Man Singh made no efforts to regain his kingdom of Palamu, retreated into Surguja and established the Raksel Rajput Dynasty of Surguja. Surguja State was one of the main princely states of Central India during the period of the British Raj. Daud Khan, who launched his invasion starting from Patna on 3 April 1660, attacked south of Gaya district and finally arrived at the Palamu Forts on 9 December 1660. The terms of surrender and payment of tribute were not acceptable to the Cheros; Daud Khan wanted complete conversion of all Hindus under the Chero rule to Islam. Following this, Khan mounted a series of attacks on the forts. Cheros defended the forts but ultimately both forts were occupied by Daud Khan, and the Cheros fled to the jungles. Hindus were driven out, the temples were destroyed, and Islamic rule imposed. Following the death of Medini Ray there was rivalry within the royal family of the Chero dynasty which ultimately lead to its downfall; this was engineered by the ministers and advisers in the court. Chitrajeet Rai's nephew Gopal Rai betrayed him and facilitated the Patna Council of the British East India Company to attack the fort. When the new fort was attacked by Captain Camac on 28 January 1771, the Chero soldiers fought valiantly but had to retreat to the old fort on account of water shortage. This facilitated the British army to occupy the new fort located on a hill without any struggle. This location was strategic and enabled the British to mount canon supported attacks on the old fort. The Cheros fought valiantly with their own canons but the old fort was besieged by the British on 19 March 1771. The fort was finally occupied by the British in 1772. The Cheros and Kharwars again rebelled against the British in 1882 but the attack was repulsed. Features Fort in the plains The old fort was built over an area of . It has three gates with rampart of width. The fort has been constructed with lime and surkhi mortar. The external boundary walls of the fort, all along its length, is built with \\"lime-surki sun-baked bricks\\", which are flat and long bricks. The central gate is the largest of three gates and is known as \\"Singh Dwar\\". The courtroom, located in the middle of the fort, is a two-storied edifice, which was used by the king to hold court. The fort had an aqueduct bringing water to meet the needs of people and animals within the fort but now seen in a ruined state. After entering from the second gate, the fort had three Hindu temples (attesting to the fact that Medini Ray was a religious Hindu king) which were partly modified into mosques when Daud Khan occupied the fort after defeating Medini Ray. On the south-western part of the fort, which is surrounded by hills on three sides, there is a small stream called the Kamadah Jheel which was used by the women of the royal family for their daily ablutions. Between this stream and the fort there are two watch towers (dom kilas) located on the hilltop which were used to track any enemy intrusions. Of these two towers, one tower houses a small temple of a goddess called Devi Mandir. Fort on the hill The fort which is situated on a hill to the west of the old fort was constructed by Medini Ray in 1673, two years before his demise. This fort has an entrance gate known as Nagpuri gate. The gate has fine carvings which are said to be an adaptation of the Nagapuri style which Medini Ray copied after he defeated the Nagpuri king Raghunath Shah. The main gate to the fort follows the Nagpuri gate, is of smaller size and has stone pillars on both sides. There are inscriptions on these pillars written in Arabic/Persian and in Sanskrit attributed to Banmali Mishra, the guru of the king. The inscription states that the fort's construction was started in the month of Magh (mid January/mid February), in 1680 Samvat according to the Hindu calendar (56.7 years ahead of the Gregorian calendar). He started building this fort for his heir Pratap Rai. However, Pratap Rai made efforts to complete the fort at Betla but failed as he did not have the same vision as his father. The fort has remained incomplete.

Game summaries Game one: Michigan 50, Albion 0 The first game was played on October 16, 1886, at Albion, with Michigan winning by a score of 50–0. The Michigan Argonaut described the game as \\"a walk-over for our team.\\" The score was already 37 to 0 when time was called for the half, and the Argonaut singled out Wright, Prettyman and Frank Higgins for their fine play. The writer noted that the Albion team was \\"not in fine trim\\" and failed to get the ball near the Michigan goal. Perhaps trying to find something favorable to say about the opponent, the Argonaut reporter observed that \\"the Albion team did their best work in tackling.\\" Game two: Michigan 24, Albion 0 Team manager and goalkeeper John Duffy. The second game was played at the Ann Arbor Fairgrounds on October 30, 1886, as part of a \\"field day\\" that included various athletic events. Michigan won the football game against Albion 24 to 0. The Michigan Argonaut noted, \\"The most striking difference between the elevens was that of weight, U. of M. presenting a much heavier team. It was evident, however, that Albion had come to play ball, and what they lacked in avoirdupois was in great measure made up by neat and rapid playing.\\" The teams agreed to play \\"two innings of thirty minutes each,\\" and the \\"rugby game\\" started at 3:35 with referee George W. Whyte calling, \\"Play.\\" Michigan lost the toss, and Jaycox kicked off for Michigan, sending the ball near Albion's goal line. Michigan scored its first touchdown seven minutes into the game to take the lead 6 to 0. Jaycox and Jim Duffy made several fine runs, and \\"Prettyman's play was characterized by his usual heavy rushing.\\" Michigan scored a second touchdown \\"just before the inning was called,\\" and led 12 to 0 at the intermission. The second inning began at 4:40 p.m., and the Argonaut reported that \\"Albion played a much better game in this inning that did Michigan, and several times it looked as though they would score.\\" Jaycox and Jim Duffy made several bad fumbles in the second inning, and Morrow, \\"who had been serving in first-class style one-fourth back, made several poor throws to the half backs and lost ground for Michigan.\\" Jim Duffy made two brilliant runs in the inning, and Jaycox ran for a touchdown shortly before the game ended. Albion objected that the field was \\"overrun with spectators,\\" and also claimed that Jaycox had run out of bounds on his touchdown run, but the claim was overruled. The Argonaut concluded its report on the game by noting, \\"The Albion boys were gentlemen, and played a square game.\\" Players Varsity letter winners * Charles N.

Football career West Ham United Weale was born in Troed-y-rhiw in Glamorgan and after playing youth football for Merthyr Tydfil he was signed by West Ham United in March 1925. He made his first team debut on 10 October 1925, replacing Tommy Yews in a 1–0 victory over Notts County. He only made three First Division appearances for the \\"Hammers\\" in his two years with the club, before being transferred to Swindon Town in June 1927. Swindon Town He made his Swindon Town debut on 17 September 1927 in a Third Division South match against Charlton Athletic (drawn 2–2). Weale was unable to displace the long serving Bertie Denyer on the right wing and it was only in April 1928 that he had a run in the first team when he played five matches, initially on the left (replacing Alec Thom) before switching to his favoured right wing. In the following season, he replaced Denyer for a run of thirteen matches from September, in which he scored seven goals (including twice against both Brighton & Hove Albion and Torquay United in consecutive matches). Once Denyer returned from injury in early December, Weale was transferred to Southampton. Southampton The \\"Saints\\" paid a then club record of £1000 to bring Weale to The Dell having been watching him for some time. He immediately replaced Bert Jepson in the No. 7 shirt and made his debut on 8 December 1928 in a 1–1 draw at Clapton Orient. A \\"fast, clever right winger\\", he made a promising start to his Southampton career, and scored a hat trick in a 4–0 victory over Notts County on Boxing Day, following this with goals in the next two matches. His crosses helped the centre-forwards, Willie Haines (in 1928–29) and Dick Rowley (in 1929–30) to score 16 and 25 goals respectively. By the middle of the 1929–30 season, Weale's form had become erratic and he lost his place to Jepson. Despite this, the club offered him a new contract in the summer of 1930, with terms of £5 per week (both winter and summer) rising to £8 per week when in the first team. Weale declined the contract and decided to move back to Wales. Later career Weale spent the 1930–31 season with Cardiff City, for whom he made only five appearances before a spell in non-league football. He subsequently played for Newport County and Wrexham and then travelled to Belfast to join Glentoran, before finishing his career back in the lower leagues in England.

She has two clothing labels: EXCEPTION de Mixmind, a ready-to-wear line started in 1996 and retailed in China; and WUYONG, an haute couture line founded in 2006. In 2007, Ma Ke starred in the award-winning documentary Useless by Chinese director Jia Zhangke. In 2008, her fashion house WUYONG was appointed as a Guest member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture in France. Ma Ke designs have been wore by the Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan, on several occasions. Ma Ke is the founder of Mixmind Art & Design Co, Ltd., based in Guangzhou, China. She currently works in her studio in Zhuhai on the southern coast of Guangdong province. Career Ma Ke graduated from the Suzhou Institute of Silk Textile Technology in 1992, and studied womenswear at Central Saint Martins. In 1996, she established her first clothing label, EXCEPTION de Mixmind. EXCEPTION is currently sold in the label's own shops in China, with major retail presence in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Their collections comprise women's clothing made from locally sourced cotton, silk, linen and wool; plus other accessories and items. In 2001, Ma Ke designed costumes for the concert Singing in Heaven, by the singer Dadawa. In 2005, she presented her clothing at the Shenzhen Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture, and in 2009 her work was on display at the National Art Museum of China. Ma Ke is among the youngest of the first generation of Chinese fashion designers who have received international acclaim, and she is the first Chinese to show at Paris Haute Couture. Ma Ke is best known abroad for her two WUYONG collections: WUYONG/the Earth, which debuted at Paris Fashion Week Spring Summer 2007; and WUYONG/Qing Pin, which was held on July 3, 2008 as her first show for Paris Haute Couture. Ma Ke's designs are celebrated for their use of environmentally friendly fabrics and recycled materials, and for their manufacture using traditional dyeing, weaving and embroidery techniques, most notably those of the Dong people of Southern China. Her fashion house EXCEPTION de Mixmind hosts shows in China each season for their new collections. Ma Ke's first two shows for WUYONG, held more than a year apart, were distinctive for their absence of a runway and for incorporating certain elements of performance art. Her unorthodox shows and anti-consumerist statements have earned Ma Ke a reputation for being anti-fashion, but she is equally lauded for her conscientious efforts to preserve traditions and protect the environment. WUYONG In 2006, Ma Ke founded a new fashion label, WUYONG (simplified Chinese: 无用; traditional Chinese: 無用; pinyin: wúyòng), which literally means Useless. Ma Ke's workshop in Zhuhai, which produces the WUYONG collections, employs a team of workers skilled in traditional clothing manufacturing techniques. All stages of production are done in-house, including the spinning, weaving, dyeing and sewing; even using traditional equipment such as a Chinese loom dating from the 19th century. Some of the articles in the collections either incorporate or are fashioned out of recycled material and found objects, including a paint-covered sheet made into a dress and an old tarpaulin constructed into an over-sized coat. Paris Fashion Week In 2007, Ma Ke was invited to present her first collection, titled WUYONG/the Earth, at Paris Fashion Week. The show was held in the gymnasium of the Lycée Stanislas on February 25, 2007. Rather than presenting the collection on a catwalk as in a traditional fashion show, Ma Ke had the models stand motionless on tall, illuminated plinths, which were arranged on the gymnasium floor. The audience was invited to walk amongst the models and examine the clothing up-close. The show was a triumph: Elle magazine called Ma Ke's Paris debut \\"brilliant... one of the great moments of the season.\\" The collection was later put on display at the gallery Joyce Palais-Royal from March 1 to April 6, 2007. WUYONG was the subject of a film about the Chinese garment industry by the award-winning director Jia Zhangke. The documentary, also titled Useless, features interviews with Ma Ke as well as her show at Paris Fashion Week. The film went on to win the Orizzonti Doc Prize at the 64th Venice Film Festival in 2007. Ma Ke is not the first Chinese fashion designer to show at Paris Fashion Week. That distinction belongs to the designer Frankie Xie and his label JEFEN, which had its Paris debut in 2006. Fashion in Motion In 2008, Ma Ke was invited to reprise WUYONG/the Earth as part of the Fashion in Motion live catwalk events held at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Three performances were given in the Raphael Gallery on May 16, 2008. Concurrently, a piece from the collection was on display in the museum's China Design Now exhibition, where Ma Ke was featured along with two other Chinese fashion designers, Zhang Da and Wang Yiyang. Paris Haute Couture In May 2008, WUYONG was appointed as a Guest member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. Her collection, titled WUYONG/Qing pin, was shown in the Jardin du Palais-Royal in Paris on July 3, 2008. There were a number of elements of the performance that made Ma Ke's haute couture debut rather exceptional. The collection was shown outside and in public (most couture shows are strictly invitation only). For models Ma Ke selected a diverse group of modern dancers, martial artists and Tai-chi practitioners, and in lieu of walking down a runway had them perform a choreographed piece by the renowned Chinese dancer Shen Wei. Ma Ke invited a Mongolian singer to perform a capella for the show, and brought two seamstresses from her Zhu Hai studio to work a traditional spinning wheel and loom during the performance. Ma Ke's haute couture debut made the front page of Le Monde. The President of the Fédération française de la couture remarked of the show, \\"We are witness to the birth of a true talent.\\" Publications * Ma Ke. (2006) Point One. Map Book Publishers. .

Jubilee House is built on the site of a building that was constructed and used for administrative purposes by the British Gold Coast Government. The previous seat of government of Ghana was Osu Castle. It was renamed Golden Jubilee House by President Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo Addo on 29 March 2018. It has previously been known as The Flagstaff House.  History  The Flagstaff House was reconstructed and inaugurated by the government of John Agyekum Kufour with the name Golden Jubilee House in November 2008 when construction was about 70%–80% completed. In January 2009, the incoming government of President John Attah Mills moved the office of the president back to Osu Castle and later changed the sign in front of the building back to its original name claiming that the previous government had not used a Legislative Instrument to effect the change as required by law. The Mills government was in turn criticized that the name Flagstaff House which was given to the building by the British Gold Coast government glorifies Ghana's Gold Coast past. The seat of government was moved back to Flagstaff House in January 2013. Construction cost The original budget for the reconstruction of $30m was a grant from the Indian government. However, BBC journalist David Amanor reported the construction may have cost as much as $45–50m. Building of the palace was overseen by an Indian contractor who used Ghanaian sub-contractors.

He also published a collection of romantic songs: \\"Zlatno doba\\" (publisher Franz Bondy, Wien). Literary work As a gymnasium student Badalić edited the periodical Ljiljan where he published his first poem in 1867 (Berba). He received literary recognition with the historic poem Panem et circenes (Vijenac, 1874). Badalić's poetry, published in his Izabrane pjesme (\\"Selected poems\\", 1896), quite popular at the time, and also set to music according to Illyrian customs (Hatze, Ja ne znam što je majka mi), is also represented in modern anthologies (Danica, 1973; Majka, 1973; Vječnotraž, 1975). His poetry encompasses various literary genres, including romantic (Bolna djevojka), odic (to Ljudevit Gaj), and elegies (U Jurjevcu), thematically mainly focussing to patriotic and occasional motifs. Based on the drama Nikolas Graf von Zriny oder die Belagerung von Sigeth by German Romanticist Theodor Körner, which premièred the opening of the new theatre building at St. Mark's Square in 1834, Badalić wrote the libretto for the historical opera Nikola Šubić Zrinski by Ivan Zajc (published in Hrvatski dom, 1876). He was also a translator of theatrical pieces by Scribe and Deschamps, Shakespeare, Goethe, and other authors.

The firm has offices in 20 cities across the globe. History Hunton & Williams was founded in 1901 in Richmond, Virginia, by Henry W. Anderson, Eppa Hunton Jr., Beverley Munford and Edmund Randolph Williams as Munford, Hunton, Williams & Anderson. It focused primarily on litigation, business and finance law. The firm changed names many times over the years; its seventh name, in 1976, was Hunton & Williams; it became Hunton & Williams LLP in 2003. The firm's most notable member, a name partner from 1954 until 1972, was Lewis F. Powell Jr., who became a member of the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971. The firm's initial hire of a woman was Elizabeth Tompkins, the first woman graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, who worked as a summer clerk at Hunton & Williams in 1921 and 1922. In 1943, during the Second World War, two women lawyers were hired to work at Hunton & Williams: Sarah Geer Dale and Nan Ross McConnell. Dale's first case involved a labor-law issue for Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock. She left the firm in 1945 to get married and retired from the practice of law. McConnell stayed on until 1948, when she married. Hunton & Williams laid claim to be the first law firm in the United States to open an office solely for the practice of law pro bono. The firm has a Centre for Information Policy Leadership, which focuses on privacy and data protection work. The managing partner, Walfrido J. \\"Wally\\" Martinez, has held that position since March 2006.

Campus Less than three blocks east of Main Street on a moderate slope, its current compact campus opened in 1939, with wings added in 1968 and 1991. The previous high school of 1912 is across Third Street to the north; it was used as the junior high until 1959 and is now the \\"1912 Center.\\" The original high school of 1892 was on the site of the present north wing; it was later Whitworth grade school and was razed in 1939. Originally a four-year high school, MHS was a senior high school (grades 10-12) for 46 years, beginning in 1966. The school district reconfigured in 2012 and Moscow High returned to a four-year school in August with the addition of the freshman class. A summer asbestos removal project was initiated in 2014 and extended into the school year due to delays. An attempt to fund a new campus on the northeast edge of the city () was defeated by voters in 2005. The levy needed a two-thirds majority to pass and was defeated with only 44% in favor. Athletics Moscow's athletic teams compete in IHSAA Class 4A, the second-highest in the state, in the Inland Empire League (4A). MHS competed against the largest schools in Idaho in Class A-1 (now 5A) until the fall of 1979. It was dropped a classification level in 1976, but successfully appealed for three years to stay. Moscow opted not to petition in 1979 and went down to A-2 (now 3A), and moved between A-2 and A-1 (Div. II) until the new IHSAA classification system placed them in 4A in 2001. Moscow's most successful run in athletics came in baseball under longtime head coach Gary Johnson. In an eight-season stretch from 1978 through 1985, the Bears were in seven state title games and won five, including three consecutive (1982-84). The early MHS basketball team won four straight Idaho titles (1917-20),idhsaa.org - Boys Basketball champions - through 2012 and more recently, the girls' basketball team won three consecutive A-2 state championships (1992-94) and another in 1996 for four in five years.idhsaa.org - Girls Basketball champions - through 2012 The boys team was an A2 state champion in 1980 finishing the season with a losing record! IN THE 1983-1984 SEASON; THE STATE OF IDAHO WAS THE \\"TEST STATE\\" FOR THE 3 POINT LINE FOR THE ENTIRE NATION FOR HIGH SCHOOLERS. That season there was tremendous excitement which created large crowds to the games. That same year an unusual requirement from the state was created as there were only 2 teams in the league at that time; Moscow and Orofino. The state required the 2 teams to play a \\"BEST OF 3\\" SERIES! Moscow won the best of 3 district Championship after losing both league games during the season! That team then had to play a \\"Regional Championship\\" at a neutral site! The Bears were an A-2 state finalist in 1996 and state champion again in 1997, winning their last twenty games. The volleyball team was undefeated (29-0) in the fall of 2005 to claim their only state title. In 1999, the boys' soccer team went 16-5-1 () and won the state title, defeating Boise High 1-0 in overtime. Moscow's football program was strong in Class A-1 in the late 1960s and early 1970s; the 1968 Bears were undefeated at 9-0. The 1968 and 1969 teams both finished second in the state writers' polls to undefeated Borah of Boise. Moscow went 9-1 in 1971 and was fourth in the final poll, 9-0 in 1975 and again polled fourth. After the move down to A-2 in 1979 and the addition of playoffs, the Bears won state titles in 1981 and 1992. Exactly when the bear became the school mascot is not well documented, but the Lewiston Morning Tribune referred to the MHS basketball team as the \\"Bears\\" in early 1927. Alumnus and head coach Lyle Smith obtained a live bear cub for a mascot in 1941. The present school colors were noted in 1936, and likely date back decades further. Facilities North street entry in 2016 South street entry in 2016 Due to limited space on its campus, the varsity athletic facilities are located approximately a mile (1.6 km) northeast at Bear Field (and Bear Den gym), adjacent to Moscow Middle School and the school district headquarters (). In 1976 and 1979, Moscow played its home football games across town at the Kibbie Dome on the University of Idaho campus, and again in 1996, when the running track at Bear Field was being replaced. Opened in early 1966, the Bear Den was originally known as the fieldhouse. State playoff and championship football games in all classifications are regularly held in the Kibbie Dome..

About an hour after he left the Presidential Office Building, as a former President of the Republic of China and no longer enjoying presidential immunity, he was arrested and restricted from leaving the nation by Taiwanese prosecutors due to allegations of corruption and abuse of authority. Chen was accused of fraud in a case involving the handling of a special presidential fund used to pursue Taiwan's foreign diplomacy. However, the Special Investigation Division dropped money-laundering charges because of a lack of evidence. President Ma Ying-jeou moved to declassify documents that would aid in the investigation of the former president's use of special expenses. President Ma was then sued by Chen's lawyers on August 6, 2008, who called Ma's declassification of case- aiding documents \\"politically motivated.\\" The documents which were sought were classified earlier by Chen. The documents are mostly receipts and records of use of special expenses.  Alleged money laundering  On August 14, 2008, shortly after a press conference held by rival party Kuomintang (KMT) legislators announcing the existence of a request for money laundering investigation assistance letter from the Swiss government, the former president called an evening press conference and admitted that his past election campaigns had misstated election finance expenses, and had leftover monies in campaign coffers forwarded to overseas accounts. Chen stated during the conference, \\"My conscience has told me that I cannot continue to lie to myself or to others, so I will choose to be bluntly honest: I have, in the past, committed deeds that are against the rule of law, and I am willing, for all campaign finance dishonesty from my four elections for mayor and for president, to apologize to the people\\". Chen claims that the money was wired overseas by his wife and without his knowing. There is also an investigation launched by Swiss authorities over a Swiss bank account bearing Chen's daughter-in-law's name: roughly US$31 million were wired to the account from Taiwan and was then forwarded again to an account in the Cayman Islands. Swiss and Taiwan authorities are cooperating in investigating whether or not there are instances of money laundering committed by members of the former first family. It is unknown whether or not the wiring of the Swiss accounts and the wiring of campaign money overseas by Mrs. Chen are related. Chen and his wife are currently restricted from leaving Taiwan. Chen's August 14 admission was a reversal of his position just one day earlier, when he vehemently denied a Next Magazine report of the same story. The following day, August 15, Chen announced that both he and his wife will leave the Democratic Progressive Party for good from the fallout of the previous day's admission. Reaction to Chen's admission was negative. Former DPP chairman Shih Ming-teh (1994–96), claimed to have been eating while Chen called his press conference, and threw his chopsticks down in anger upon hearing his confession. Chen's vice- president for throughout his eight years, Annette Lu, has said, \\"If I had not heard it with my own ears, I would not have believed it; I am still in disbelief. Any person who genuinely loves Taiwan will not wire money of contributors and of the people overseas. The former first family have affronted Taiwan and the Taiwanese people\\" Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen, on August 15, resigned from the Democratic Progressive Party and apologized, saying \\"Today I have to say sorry to all of the DPP members and supporters. I let everyone down, caused you humiliation and failed to meet your expectations. My acts have caused irreparable damage to the party. I love the DPP deeply and am proud of being a DPP member. To express my deepest regrets to all DPP members and supporters, I announce my withdrawal from the DPP immediately. My wife Wu Shu-jen is also withdrawing from the party.\\" DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen also apologized to the public on behalf of the party: \\"In regard to Chen and his wife’s decision to withdraw from the party and his desire to shoulder responsibility for his actions as well as to undergo an investigation by the party’s anti-corruption committee, we respect his decision and accept it.\\" Taiwan prosecutors on August 16 interrogated Wu Shu- jen and asked her to explain overseas money transactions. A Kuomintang (KMT) party member alleged that Chen's wife bought jewelry to launder money. Hung Hsiu-chu, a member of the ruling KMT, charged that Chen's family opened four bank accounts in Switzerland, with total deposits of US$32 million, which Chen remitted through his daughter-in-law, Huang Jui-ching. On August 17, Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office announced Taiwanese investigators took away boxes of documents, after search of Chen's home in Taipei City, his office, and in Tainan, at the home of his wife's brother Wu Ching-mao. Chen was prohibited by prosecutors from leaving Taiwan. Chen has (US?/NT?)$21 million at overseas banks held in the name of family members. Shih Ming-teh, a former leader of Chen's Democratic Progressive Party accused Chen of laundering at least (US?/NT?)$85 million from an entrepreneur bidding for bank ownership in 2005.Former president barred from leaving Taiwan AP News, August 17, 2008 Coast Guard Administration spokesman Hsieh Ching-chin said: \\"We received the order from the special investigation unit around 9:20 p.m. last night saying former president Chen was barred from leaving the country.\\" Chen's probe concerns NT$14.8 million (US$480,500) in special expenses from the government, while he was president, and his wife is on trial for corruption and document forgery. Prosecutors found at least NT$1.5 million had been spent on diamond rings and other luxury items for his wife. newsinfo.inquirer.net, Ex-president barred from leaving Taiwan Upon his return to Taiwan, Chen's son claimed that he was a mere \\"figurehead,\\" and was not directly involved in the transfer of money. Chen commented upon the public's suspicions that he had engaged in money laundering by colorfully stating: \\"Money is dry, it cannot be laundered; money is clean, not dirty, it does not need to be laundered.\\" On October 31, 2008, Chiou I-jen was arrested and detained incommunicado, by Supreme Prosecutors Office's Special Investigation Division Prosecutors, for alleged embezzlement of about US$500,000 (£308,000) from diplomatic funds, in 2004, as secretary-general of the National Security Council. Chen Shui-bian called his arrest a \\"political persecution\\" by the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang government amid and after another senior DPP member -- Chiayi County magistrate Chen Ming-wen's detention on corruption charges: \\"The government abused the laws and its powers to persecute and humiliate us but the people and the history will return justice to us and prove our innocence. The government of President Ma Ying-jeou is settling old scores in the name of a campaign against corruption. The Special Investigation Division (SID), in order to indict and convict me, has been taking high-profile actions, locking up members of the former government team one by one.\\" Chiou I-jen is the 8th suspect in spin- offs of Chen Shui-bian's money laundering probes under the jurisdiction of the Taipei District Court.  Arrest and detention  Chen was escorted by security staff, on November 11, 2008, into the Taipei prosecutor's office for questioning. He was served a subpoena for the 5th time by the Special Investigation Division (SID) on November 10, but he opted to exercise his right to remain silent in the 6-month SID money-laundering probe, and the case terminates on November 24. Chen alleged that \\"The KMT and the Chinese Communist Party see me as their number one prisoner as I am the biggest stone blocking their way to reunification. Chinese envoy Chen Yunlin had a bad time in Taiwan... so (Taiwan's President) Ma Ying-jeou wants to put me in jail as a sacrifice to appease China. I am very honoured and proud to play such a role.\\" He then commented, \\"the voice of Taiwanese people can never be suppressed by heavy-handed riot police presence, nor could it be clamped down by razor wires; Taiwan independence; my heart will be with all 23 million people... I will spend the rest of my limited life to fight for justice with the public; the prosecutors would file a request to detain me and the Taipei District Court would grant the request for detention. Long live Taiwanese democracy. Long live Taiwanese independence.\\" On 12 November 2008, Taiwan Affairs Office of the PRC in a routine press conference denied the allegation describing it as a \\"rumour\\". It further stated it \\"believes that people can see through the purpose behind this clumsy tactic of rumour making\\". After 6 hours, Chen left the Supreme Court prosecutor's office in handcuffs, arrested and detained. He held his cuffed hands up for journalists and shouted \\"Political persecution! Long live Taiwan!\\" Prosecutors, led by investigation spokesman Chen Yun-nan, filed a detention request with the Taipei District Court. He said he would enter \\"Taiwan's Bastille (Tucheng Jail),\\" but \\"it will only lock up my body, not my heart.\\" The charges carry each a minimum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.Former Taiwanese president led away in handcuffs AP News, November 11, 2008 Chen, 57, arrived at the Taipei District Court, after the prosecutor's marathon interrogation (from 9:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on November 11). The 11-hour trial started at 8:00 p.m. on November 11. The Court suspended the proceedings, after Chen's lawyer Lai Ching-te claimed a policeman hit him. Chen was rushed to National Taiwan University Hospital, and after 2 hours, the doctors confirmed a slight right arm muscle injury due to strain, possibly caused by a police officer's unintentional pulling of his arm while being detained. Following a night of deliberation, the Taipei District Court formally arrested and jailed Chen, at 7:06 a.m. on November 12, under an order that does not constitute an indictment. Chen can be held for 4 months before being formally charged. Huang Chun-min, Taipei district court spokesman quoted the ruling: \\"The court, after questioning the suspect, believes the suspected crimes to be severe. And there are enough facts to believe there was buried evidence, fabrication, altered evidence and conspiracy among suspects or witnesses.\\" He was sent to the Taipei Detention Center, 8:00 a.m., where, as a dissident leader 21 years ago, he served 8 months for defaming a Nationalist Party official.Taiwan's Chen ordered detained AP news, November 11, 2008 Chen's attorneys' filed waiver of his right to appeal the order. Chen, banned from communicating with anybody outside the Taipei Detention Center, can be in custody for a maximum of 2 months. He joins nine others detained on alleged laundering (US?/NT?)$30 million, which include Ma Yong- cheng, Chiou I-Jen, the ex-vice premier, Yeh Sheng-mao, and Chen's brother-in- law, Wu Ching-mao, inter alia. Chen was assigned prisoner number 2630.  Hunger strike and privileges  His lawyer Cheng Wen-long (鄭文龍) stated, on November 13: \\"He intends to stop eating in protest ... in an okay condition now. He's not eating anything. I've been urging him, but he still refuses. Chen was willing to stay in the dark prison cell (Tucheng detention center in Taipei) for the people... to protest the death of justice and the regression of democracy ... he can sacrifice his life for the \\"Republic of Taiwan\\" (quotation). His arrest is like 'sentencing without a trial'. Chen had only drunk water since entering a detention centre early Wednesday and had not eaten a proper meal since late Tuesday.\\" Corrections official Lee Ta-chu said his institution \\"is monitoring (Chen's) situation closely.\\" Meanwhile, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, stated \\"the office will act in accordance with a statute which allows for a secret service team of 8 to 12 persons assigned to a former president, for a payment of NT$250,000 per month to be made to him, and for him to collect an annual allocation of up to NT$8 million to cover the expenses of day-to-day operation of his office. Except for the security detail, Chen will retain all other aspects of the preferential treatment. The Presidential Office has listed NT$11.25 million in its 2009 annual budget for allocation to Chen.\\" Chen ended his two-week hunger strike on Nov. 27.http://au.news.yahoo.com/a/-/world/5176412/taiwans-detained- exleader-resumes-eating/ Hospitalization, appeal and petition for release On November 16, 2008, Chen collapsed and was rushed to Taipei's Far Eastern Memorial Hospital due to complications and weakness from dehydration caused by six days of malnutrition. He was treated with saline and glucose injections after experiencing \\"an excessively fast heartbeat and tightness in chest,\\" amid slow metabolism. Chen was transferred to the Panchiao Hospital Monday for possible force-feeding.english.rti.org.tw, Chen hospitalized for weakness and dehydration Despite Chen's lack of interest to appeal, his lawyer Cheng Wen-long completed the motion to release from detention and notice of appeal of the court's decision, with a petition for constitutional interpretation to restrain actions violative of the Constitution. Formal indictment and further developments Former President Chen Shui-bian was released without bail on 13 December 2008 after being indicted for money- laundering and misuse of public funds hours earlier. The district court ordered that Chen remain in Taiwan to face pending trial. Chen was arraigned before judges at the Taipei district court, where he protested the \\"political persecution\\" against him. Chen reaffirmed his innocence, claiming the US$21 million his wife wired to their son's Swiss bank accounts came from leftover campaign donations. Also indicted were former first lady Wu Shu-chen, their son Chen Chih-chung and their son's wife Huang Jui-ching, as well as other relatives, friends and top assistants. Two of the nine other defendants are relatives of the Chen family. Prosecutors say Chen and his wife together embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a special presidential fund, and received bribes of US$11.73 million in connection with a government land procurement deal and a separate construction project. Prosecutor Lin Che-hui said that a particularly damning piece of evidence was the presence of NT$740 million (US$22.2 million) in cash stashed in a Taipei bank safety vault held by the Chens. \\"Ex-president Chen Shui-bian's crimes are major,\\" said Chen Yun- nan, spokesman for the Supreme Court's special prosecutor's office. \\"We will ask the courts to give ex-president Chen Shui-bian the strictest punishment\\". President Ma Ying-jeou made no comment on the indictment, but Democratic Progressive Party leaders demanded that Chen be released on bail. No other former President of the Republic of China has faced criminal prosecution. First appeal for continued detention  On 16 December 2008, prosecutors of the Special Counsel filed an appeal to reverse Chen's release and to resume his detention out of fear Chen may flee the country. \\"After serving as president for eight years,\\" the appeal said, \\"Chen Shui-bian knows the national security mechanism full well, and the chances he has to flee the country are greater than ordinary citizens\\". The appeal cited several instances where other leaders (such as Alberto Fujimori of Peru, Pavlo Lazarenko of Ukraine, Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand, and Ferdinand Marcos of Philippines) having been indicted, fled their respective countries after they had been charged with corruption and graft. On December 18, Judge Chou again ruled that Chen be released without bail, albeit the High Court warned of the possibility that he may collaborate or intimidate other defendants, including his relatives and Yu Cheng-hsien, former minister of the interior. Second appeal for continued detention  On 25 December 2008, prosecutors of the same counsel appealed for the second time for continued detention of the former President. In this second appeal, the prosecution urged the Taiwan High Court to decide to detain or release Chen rather than remit the case to Judge Chou Chan-chun (周占春) again. Reversing their initial decision not to appeal, Special Counsel prosecutors submitted their written appeal to the Taiwan high court, requesting that Chen be detained. The grounds for the detention remain the same (fear that the former President might leave the country, conspire with witnesses or destroy evidence). The chances are that the High Court will pass the buck back to Chou, who said in releasing Chen for the second time, he hopes he would not have to hand down the same ruling again. One reason for the appellate court to remit the case again is that the Special Counsel failed to elaborate on the possibility of Chen's intimidation of other defendants. Rather it kept on elaborating on the possibility of Chen's escape alone. Another piece of evidence produced to sustain this second appeal was the fact that bodyguards stay overnight on the ground floor of the Paolai Estate in Taipei, where the Chens live in an 11th floor apartment. \\"There is little chance the bodyguards would know what is happening on the 11th floor,\\" the new appeal says. Judge change The next day, the 26th of December, in a meeting held among the court's presiding judges, a vote decided that Presiding Judge Tsai Shou-hsun (蔡守訓) would take over the Chen-related case from Presiding Judge Chou Chan-chun (周占春) because Tsai had previously handled cases concerning Chen. Judges at the court held a raffle for the assignment to handle the case. Panning the move as \\"political intervention,\\" DPP caucus whip Ker Chien-ming (柯建銘) yesterday declared that \\"the judiciary is doomed\\". Cheng Wen-lung (鄭文龍), who is Chen's defense attorney made his own public declaration: \\"We do not care for how the Special Investigation Division is conducting itself. How can the court change the judges after the lots have already been openly cast? (By doing so,) the public confidence in the system will greatly decrease\\". However, legislators of the ruling Kuomintang, such as Chiu Yi questioned whether Tsai had the wherewithal to rule in Chen's case: \\"Over the past two years, Tsai Shou-shun has allowed Wu Shu-jen to be absent from 18 court proceedings. The case has been stalled for more than two years and wasted a lot of public resources\\". Lee Teng-hui connection This same day (26 December), in an event related to this case, the Special Investigation Division of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced it would investigate former president Lee Teng-hui, who preceded Chen Shui-bian in the presidency of the Republic of China on suspicion of money laundering. SIP spokesman Chen Yun-nan (陳雲南) held a meeting with reporters. When asked if former president Chen Shui-bian was the accuser as some local media had reported, the prosecutor said \\"yes\\". Political reactions to this new accusation soon emerged: Taiwan Solidarity Union Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia (林志嘉) slammed Chen Shui-bian for blurring the focus of the case by allegedly accusing Lee (the party's spiritual leader). \\"Everyone knows Chen's only tactic left is to blur the focus. I am 200 percent confident in Lee’s integrity,\\" Lin declared. Later the same day however, one of Chen Shui-bian's defense attorneys, Shih Yi-lin (石宜琳), said his client never filed any complaints with the prosecutors against Lee. Lee denied the charges on December the 21, and said he welcomed investigation. On Friday the 26th, his office declined to comment on the prosecutors' move. The 27th of December 2008, former Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Lin Cho-shui lashed out at the former president for not only being a corrupt president, but also a \\"ratting\\" president who is seriously plaguing the DPP, Taiwan, and the Taiwan independence movement. Lin declared this in response to press reports that Chen accused Lee Teng-hui of embezzling NT$ 1.6 billion from the national coffers when interrogated by prosecutors of his corruption scandals, but then immediately asked his lawmaker to deny the accusation after prosecutors confirmed that Chen did file the accusation against Lee. Lin said that Lee should face legal prosecution if he was really involved in the corruption scandal as accused by Chen, also adding that if Chen ratted on Lee's embezzlement scandal based on a sense of justice, \\"why is it okay for him to embezzle a tremendous amount of money, and why is it okay to accuse Lee and then deny the accusation?\\" \\"Such a ratting practice by Chen is designed mainly to divert public attention away from his corruption cases,\\" Lin said. This same day, former President of the Republic of China Lee Teng- hui said that the country's power transfer of 2000 only \\"provided someone with the opportunity to take bribes and launder money\\". He also added that \\"It is a pity that one man was able to mess up the administration's governance so badly.\\" In another moment of his speech at the annual meeting of the Chiayi chapter of the Friends of Lee Teng-hui Association he declared that \\"what is even more pitiful is that some people continue to support the corrupt politician in defiance of his approaching court trial\\". \\"They (the supporters of Chen Shuibian) cannot tell right from wrong\\". He never mentioned the name of Chen in any moment. He also had harsh words for the Ma Ying-jeou administration, concerning the management of the Global financial crisis of 2008, also stating that democracy and the human rights conditions in Taiwan have been back pedaling since the 2008 legislative and presidential Kuomintang victories and the transfer of power. Chen has accused Lee of having laundered as much as US$ 51 million through overseas dummy accounts, but Lee has repeatedly denied the allegations. Before boarding a high-speed train to Chiayi, when asked to comment on the money laundering allegations, he declared that \\"that's laughable stuff\\". Back into detention (second appeal result) On 29 December 2008, the former President strongly defended himself again as innocent of all corruption charges at a prolonged hearing held by three judges of Taipei District Court that tried to determine whether to put the former national leader back into custody on the second request of prosecutors. The debated hearing session started at 2:00 p.m. that day and continued into the early morning on the 30th of December. He was accompanied by a team of three lawyers. Outside the district court a large number of police were deployed to prevent possible confrontation between Chen's supporters and opponents. Chen's lawyers complained to new presiding Judge Tsai Shou-hsun (蔡守訓) about the lopsided manpower on each side, saying there were six prosecutors present at the hearing versus only four on their side (three lawyers plus Chen, who himself is a licensed lawyer). Tsai rejected all the requests. The former President stressed that he never took bribes concerning the payoff involving the construction of the Nangang Exhibition Hall or the transaction of a land parcel related to an industrial park in Longtan, Taoyuan County. Concerning the deposits at bank accounts abroad, Chen stressed that the money deposited abroad was all left over from political contributions he received and expenditures on campaigns. His lawyers also defined the money as residual funds from election campaigns and said Chen did not break any law because there were no regulations requiring candidates to report their finances at the time when the money was wired abroad. Concerning the land transaction, the prosecutors pointed out that Chen used his position to force the Cabinet to change its position to approve the deal. As a result, Taiwan Cement Corporation paid NT$400 million as commission for the land purchase. A total of US$6 million of the total amount was passed through several bank accounts held by the former first family and friends abroad in an attempt to hide the illegality of the fund, the prosecutors said. They also stressed, as in the first appeal, the necessity to place Chen under detention because there are several other scams allegedly related to him which are still under probe. The prosecutors have so far uncovered at least NT$740 million in illegal gains tied to the Chen family but they were able to seize only NT$172 million of the total fund. After considering the case, this same day (30 December), the Court ordered former President Chen Shui-bian returned to jail pending trial on corruption charges, accepting prosecutors' arguments that he be locked up to prevent him fleeing or colluding with alleged coconspirators. In a statement the Taipei District Court said Chen's detention was necessary for his trial to go smoothly: \\"Out of concerns for human rights and the public interest, Chen Shui-bian should be detained but he should also be allowed to receive visitors\\". Chen was taken back to Tucheng detention center in suburban Taipei early on 30 December, following a 12-hour court hearing. He spent 31 days in Tucheng after his arrest 12 November. During that time he was only allowed to see his lawyers. Chen's lawyers said they will appeal the new detention order. One of the former president's lawyers, Cheng Wen-lung (Jen Wenlong), described the ruling as \\"unfair\\" and vowed to appeal: \\"The ruling is not a surprise, because apparently it is the result of politics intervening in justice,\\" the lawyer said. \\"My client... said he would keep striving to prove his innocence,\\" he said. He also stated that: \\"We question the work of the Taipei district court. Changing the judge is an interference with the justice system\\". Political reactions to this new development soon emerged following party lines: Democratic Progressive Party Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen said that the government and the judicial authorities should explain to the public why they felt it necessary to detain Chen ahead of his trial. \\"The detention and handcuffing of Chen ahead of his trail may have violated the Constitution,\\" she said, also adding that the government should clear up doubts on whether the change of judges before Chen's trial was a result of political pressure. Chen's office criticized the decision to re-detain Chen, saying it once again highlighted the Ma Ying-jeou administration's efforts to wage judicial persecution and a political vendetta against the former President. The statement also denounced the new presiding judge, saying his argument for Chen's custody was nothing but a show cooked up for the purpose of sending him back to prison. The office of the former President also questioned the impartiality of Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng, who they said was not only \\"arrogant\\" but also \\"blind\\". When asked for comment, Kuomintang Legislator Lee Ching-hua applauded the court's detention of Chen: \\"The court’s decision to detain Chen Shui-bian was the best possible gift to the public before year’s end. All of the witnesses (in the case) no longer need to be afraid,\\" Lee said. Taiwan High Court Ruling On 6 January 2009, the Taiwan High Court upheld a lower court decision to detain the former President. The High Court determined that Chen's appeal against the Taipei District Court's ruling was unjustified and concluded that Chen's detention is necessary to facilitate subsequent trials. It mentioned the possibility that Chen could run away, destroy or forge evidence, or collude with co- conspirators. No further appeal of the detention ruling is permitted. Chen's lawyer Cheng Wen-lung called the ruling \\"unlawful\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\", and said he will petition for a constitutional interpretation by the Constitutional Court on behalf of the former President. The High Court noted in its ruling that Chen's intent to flee is demonstrated by the fact that the former first family has tried to conceal its alleged illicit gains in bank accounts created under the names of other people. The court made the ruling after Chen's lawyer appealed the Taipei District Court's December 29 decision to put Chen back into custody. The trial is scheduled to begin at the Taipei District Court on January 19. On 8 June 2010, the Taipei District Court found former President Chen Shui-bian not guilty of embezzling diplomatic funds. On 11 June, the High Court decided to cut former president Chen's life sentence for corruption to 20 years in jail. Despite the reduced sentence, on 18 June 2010, the high court decided to retain the former president in jail for another 2 months. Republic of China Supreme Court Ruling On Nov. 11, 2010, the Republic of China Supreme Court sentenced Chen and his wife, Wu Shu- jen (吳淑珍), to 11 years in prison for taking bribes for a land procurement scam in Longtan and 8 years in a separate office-buying scandal. The rulings were the final convictions in a string of corruption cases implicating Chen and his wife. By law, the High Court can decide whether the combined 19-year sentence should be served concurrently or consecutively. It was ruled that Chen's total prison time should be 17-and-a-half years. Chen made history as Taiwan's first former head of state to be jailed. In addition Chen is ordered to pay a fine of NT$154 million. It is unusual as the same group of judges gave a not-guilty ruling on a similar case base on the reason \\"the officer duty has to be clearly specified and no violation of law if the officer does not violate his duty.\\" Both the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that they respected the court's decision. Three other cases, including charges related to another land deal, money laundering and embezzling secret diplomatic funds, for which the Taiwan High Court originally ruled the former president should serve a 20-year sentence, were returned to the lower court by the Supreme Court for another ruling.

ST-Ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson and STMicroelectronics established on 3 February 2009 and dissolved 2 August 2013. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, it was a fabless company, outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies. Both Ericsson and STMicroelectronics appointed four directors to the board with Hans Vestberg, President and CEO of Ericsson, serving as the chairman of the board and Carlo Bozotti, President and CEO of STMicroelectronics, as the vice-chairman.  History  ST-Ericsson was formed on 3 February 2009 when STMicroelectronics and Ericsson completed the merger of Ericsson Mobile Platforms and ST-NXP Wireless into a 50/50 joint venture. On 20 August 2008, STMicroelectronics and Ericsson announced their interest to merge their wireless semiconductor businesses. ST contributed its multimedia and connectivity products as well as their 2G/EDGE platform and 3G offering. Ericsson contributed its 3G and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) platform technology. The merger followed an existing strategic co-operation between Ericsson Mobile Platforms and ST-NXP Wireless. Ericsson also had a venture with Sony called Sony Ericsson during 2001–2012. On 11 December 2012, ST- Ericsson was on the brink of shutdown after its parent company STMicroelectronics decided to move out of the JV, citing loss of market share due to ST-Ericsson failing to attain Break-even. Since ST-Ericsson came into being in 2009, STMicroelectronics has slipped from 5 to 7 in global semiconductor firms' rakings. On 18 March 2013, the parent companies announced that the joint venture was to be closed down, with the parent companies taking over parts, but not all, of its operation and products. On 28 May 2013, ST- Ericsson announced that they would sell the assets and intellectual property rights for its mobile connectivity Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to Intel for $90 million. On 5 August 2013 Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) announced the closing of the transaction for the split up of ST-Ericsson. This follows the announcement the companies made on 18 March 2013 on the chosen strategic option for the future of the joint venture. Effective 2 August 2013 Ericsson has taken on the design, development and sales of the LTE multimode thin modem solutions, including 2G, 3G and 4G interoperability. ST has taken on the existing ST-Ericsson products, other than LTE multimode thin modems, and the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) connectivity solution sold to a third party, and related business as well as certain assembly and test facilities.  ST-NXP Wireless  ST-NXP Wireless, a joint venture made up of the wireless operations of STMicroelectronics and NXP Semiconductors, began operations on 2 August 2008. NXP and STMicroelectronics announced on 10 April 2008 that they would combine their wireless operations in 2G, 2.5G, 3G, multimedia, connectivity and future wireless technologies. The combined venture was created from businesses that together owned significant portfolios of communication and multimedia patents. Formerly a division of the semiconductor firm Royal Philips Electronics, NXP was established as an independent company in 2006. STMicroelectronics was formed in June 1987 by the merger of semiconductor companies SGS Microelettronica of Italy and Thomson Semiconductors, the semiconductor arm of France's Thomson.  Ericsson Mobile Platforms  Ericsson Mobile Platforms had been formed in 2001 from Ericsson Mobile Communications during the European telecom crisis around the year 2000. It was a pure platform company after the transfer of all handset products to SonyEricsson, later Sony Mobile. At the forming of ST-Ericsson, Ericsson Mobile Platforms had roughly 3100 employees. Some of EMPs customers were Flextronics, HTC, LG, NEC, Sagem, Sharp and of course Sony Ericsson. The main focus in the company was for the eight years it existed, to develop a platform for UMTS. Their main development centers were situated in Lund, Sweden and with other three developments centers in Basingstoke (UK) and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (US), and Nuremberg (Germany). In addition, it had R&D;, sales and customer support teams in Tokyo (Japan), Shanghai (China), Taipei (Taiwan), Seoul (South Korea), Grimstad (Norway) and Nuremberg (Germany). It provided mobile terminal technology to customers who wanted to develop and produce mobile phones for the GPRS, EDGE and WCDMA mobile standards. EMP and, Ericsson as a whole, donated resources to standardization bodies such as 3GPP, OMA, JCP and OMTP.  Portfolio and mobile products  The ST-Ericsson Snowball is a single-board computer in the Nano-ITX form factor using the A9500 version of the NovaThor SoC. Before joining the joint venture, ST Microelectronics' wireless division had been working on the Nomadik application processor platform since the STn8800, which won the Microprocessor Report Analysts' Choice Awards in 2003. Likewise, the NXP part of the company had worked on a product named Nexperia. The Nomadik platform was chosen as a starting point for development of new application processors within the company. October third, 2008 the predecessor Ericsson Mobile Platforms showcased a handheld prototype for LTE (fourth generation of mobile telephony). At this time, the company stated that the technology would reach the market by roughly 2011. In December 2009 the LTE- platform had a name: M710 and it was presented as a multimode-device that would also be able to handle HSDPA. 1 November 2010 there were statements about a product named M700 and it was said that this would deliver data speeds of 100Mbit/s downstream and 50 Mbit/s upstream. Starting 15 February 2011 the company presented a whole family of products: * A series of application processors under the brand name Nova such as A9600, A9540 and A9500. * A series of modem products under the brand name Thor such as M5720, M5730, M5780, M7300, M7400 and M7450. * A series of combined products with both application processor and modem under the brand name NovaThor such as T5008, U4500, U8500, L9540, L8540 and L8580. Many of these products appear to have failed to reach the market. In the press release regarding the last product L8580 it is mentioned that U8500 has been mass-produced and that L8540 is available in samples since the end of 2012. The quarterly results for the fourth quarter 2012 states that the company has shipped 10.7 million units of U8500 during that quarter. ST-Ericsson's Chinese subsidiary, T3G was acquired in December 2008 and has been developing platforms for the TD-SCDMA mobile standard since 2003.  Locations  Incorporated in Switzerland and headquartered in Geneva, ST-Ericsson employed around 6,700 people worldwide, more than 85 per cent of whom work in R&D.; ST-Ericsson's main centers are in France, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Germany, UK, India, Singapore, China, Japan and Korea.

History The Global Planners Network was founded in 2006 at the first World Planners Congress in Vancouver, as an informal collaboration. This Congress was held on June 17 to June 20, 2006, and was hosted by the Canadian Institute of Planners and the Planning Institute of British Columbia, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Association of Planners. It directly preceded and fed into the third World Urban Forum (WUF3), organised by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN- HABITAT) in Vancouver and facilitated and funded by the Government of Canada. The Global Planners Network held a second Congress directly preceding the fourth session of the World Urban Forum (WUF4) in Nanjing, China 2008, in nearby Zhenjiang. The Congress was organised by the American Planning Association and the Zhenjiang Municipal People's Government.Zhenjiang Municipal People's Government: http://www.zhenjiang.gov.cn The Global Planners Network founder members attended WUF4, which was hosted by the UN-HABITAT, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, PRC. At a WUF4 UN-Habitat Seminar ‘Global Planners Network Messages & Outreach’UN-HABITAT Seminar http://www.unhabitat.org/content.asp?typeid=19&catid;=535&cid;=5933#55 the GPN presented its CommuniquéCommuniqué: http://www.globalplannersnetwork.org/pdf/08gpncommunique.pdf and latest Action Plan.Action Plan: http://www.globalplannersnetwork.org/pdf/08closingplenarymemo.pdf Mission & Priorities The Global Planners Network mission was first set out at the first Global Planners Congress World Planners Congress 2006, in the Vancouver Declaration.As point 1 above - Vancouver Declaration The objectives in this Declaration were shaped by discussions at the Congress and a position paper Reinventing Planning: www.rtpi.org.uk/download/5176/reinventingplanning.pdf on what was termed \\"new urban planning.\\" At the second Global Planners Congress, held in Zhenjiang from 31 October to 2 November 2008, the commitment was engraved in a commemorative stone at the Congress venue: \\"Building on the 2006 Vancouver Declaration, the Global Planners Network steers towards harmonious settlements, places in harmony with nature and places where there is harmony between people. We champion planning as a strategic, integrative, inclusive and pro-poor process. As a tool for urban development and environmental management, effective planning alleviates poverty, reduces inequality, slows down slum formation, mitigates hazards and builds safe, inclusive settlements. We leave Zhenjiang renewing our commitment to increase the global capacity to plan and manage settlements in timely, affordable and harmonious ways. We will continue to bring planners together and strengthen their links with communities, professionals, politicians and civil society to enhance the quality and future resilience of human settlements.\\" Professor Stuart Emin has been made Honorary Member of the organisation.

The term Olędrzy has been used to describe two related, but slightly different, groups of settlers. First, it describes settlers in Poland from Friesland and the rest of the Netherlands,\\"A Significant Present: Dutch Mennonites in Poland\\", Radio Netherlancs Archives, October 16, 2002 most often of the Mennonite faith, who in the 16th and 17th centuries founded villages in Royal Prussia, along the Vistula River and its tributaries, in Kuyavia, Mazovia and Greater Poland. They possessed knowledge of flood control, and a well-developed agrarian culture. At that time, they were the wealthiest group of peasants. They maintained personal freedom, and their own religion and beliefs. After the First Partition of Poland, some of them emigrated to Ukraine. Second, in a later period (up to the middle of the 19th century), the term Olędrzy (German: Hauländer) was used to describe settlers of different ethnicities (principally Germans and Poles, at times Scots, Czechs, and Hungarians), who benefited from certain privileges resulting from the law established by the Frisian and Dutch colonists (such as personal freedom, long-term or perpetual use of land, and the possibility of transmitting land to heirs). The most important characteristic, however, was collective responsibility of the entire Olęder community for its obligations toward the land owner and the specific character of the community's self- government. Thus, the distinguishing characteristics of an Olęder settlement are legal, and not ethnic, religious or economic. Consequently, the word Olęder is not synonymous with \\"Dutch settler.\\" According to studies conducted so far, from 1527/1547 to 1864 on the terrain of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, later divided into three parts in the Polish partitions, at least 1700 Olęder settlements were established. Of those, in at least 300 settlements, the settlers were ethnic Dutch. Traces of these settlements are still visible in village architecture, the physical layout of villages, and in the names of villages (Holendry, Olędry, Olendry, etc.)  Terminology  Kąkolewo, founded in 1720, located between Nowy Tomyśl (Neutomischel) and Grodzisk Wielkopolski (Grätz). Polish sources use a variety of terms for olęder settlers: Hollendrzy, Holędrzy, Holendrzy, Olędrzy, and Olendrzy. These are interchangeable, and derive from the first settlers from the Netherlands, who moved into Ducal Prussia and Royal Prussia beginning in the 16th century. It is important, however, to recognize that over time the term lost its ethnic meaning, and therefore Olendrzy refers to all settlers living under the legal regime introduced by the Dutch colonists, including most notably the Vistula Germans and Vistula delta Mennonites. It is also important to underline, that not all settlements carrying the name Olędry (or similar) were in fact settled by Olendrzy. Rusiński gives examples of such instances in Greater Poland: Wymysłowo (known in some sources as Czarkowskie Olędry) or Burzykowo in the parish of Oborniki (on some German maps called Burzykower Holl.). Rusiński argues that although though those villages had the name Olędry, that is not a basis for calling them genuine olędry settlements, because in their cases one does not find the legal arrangements typical of such colonization (collective responsibility to the land owner and characteristic olęder self-government). A separate problem is the question of the German words that function as two alternatives: Holländer and Hauländer. According to earlier German historical writings, they had two distinct meanings, reflecting a difference in the type of settlement. After all, Olędry were settled chiefly on difficult terrain, which required proper preparation to plant or raise livestock. The referenced historians argued that on low, wet terrain subject to flooding, settlers were called Holländer (in reference to the settlers from the Netherlands who were specialists in flood control and drainage), while those who colonists who settled in thick forests requiring clearing were called Hauländer (from the German hauen – to hew, to chop). However, that viewpoint has been recognized as inaccurate (both in German history writing as well as Polish), as evidenced by those settlements on flood plains called Hauland and villages that appeared on the road to clearings in the forest called Holland. Most likely, the word Hauländer started as a variant of Holländer, and appeared through blending the names of settlements with the name for woodcutters.  Reasons for colonization  The beginnings of Olęder colonization must be sought in the Middle Ages in the area where Germans lived. The first records come from the area of Bremen in the year 1106. At that time, settlement was closely linked to the territorial expansion of the German rulers into Slavic territory. Southern Holstein was colonized by Duke Adolf II of Holstein, while Albert \\"the Bear\\" and Henry \\"the Lion\\" installed settlers from the Netherlands in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. (Indeed, Albert \\"the Bear\\" was an especially active coloniser.) The beginning of the second wave of settlement from the Netherlands, this time directly to Polish soil, occurred in the 16th century. Three chief causes of that colonization can be distinguished: * Religious persecution in the Netherlands : The Reformation found fertile ground there. Anabaptism, from which later arose the Mennonites, became widely accepted. At the same time, the Habsburg rulers of Spain, who also ruled the Netherlands -- Emperor Charles V and King Philip II – as devoted Catholics zealously sought to eradicate heresy in their territories. This led to Protestant emigration in search of a more tolerant environment. * The Economic Situation in the Netherlands : Unrest in the Netherlands, the struggle for independence during the Dutch Revolt, and the presence in the Netherlands of the Spanish army and the forces of William I of Orange led to collapse in the rural economy. The devastation of war led to common hunger, an epidemic of bubonic plague and frequent suffering. For many enterprising farmers this was an additional stimulus to emigrate. * Depopulation of Prussia after the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–1521) and the Desire of Landowners for Greater Profits : As a final result of the Polish-Teutonic War, many villages on the borders of Prussia were devastated, and were deserted by their inhabitants. At the same time, the landowners endeavored to increase their incomes, by, among other things, cultivating new lands, especially by clearing forests and draining swamps. Immigrants from the Netherlands had centuries of experience with that latter task.  Course of colonization  Palczewo – one of the remnants of Olęder settlements in Żuławy A skansen in Dziekanowice near Poznań. The open-air museum contains many relics of wooden Olęder architecture Before Olęder settlers arrived on the soil of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, they were already present in Ducal Prussia. The first settlement in that region appeared in the area of modern-day Pasłęk. However, conflicts frequently arose between the Dutch and Germans regarding property, religion and customary law. Before long, those first settlers began looking for a new home. The first Polish terrain colonized by newcomers from the Netherlands was in Royal Prussia. In the middle of the 16th century, the government of Gdańsk, led by Mayor Ferber, decided to populate Żuławy Gdańskie, which had been given the city by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1454. The effort to settle locals there failed, because the peasants could not cope with flooding. Consequently, the people of Gdańsk agreed to an attempt to settle Netherlanders in the deserted village of Laudan. The newcomers from the Netherlands easily mastered the unfavorable conditions, and soon thereafter additional Olęder settlements appeared in Pomerania. Among others, these included Nowy Dwór (called Tiegenhof in 1562), Orłowo, Żelichowo, Markusy and Jurandowo. Soon colonization spread to the Starostwo of Puck (such as Karwieńskie Błoto and Reda), and – even more importantly – began to progress up the Vistula River. Settlements appeared in the starostwas of Gniew and Sztum (including Szkaradowo, Benowo, Pułkowice, Szropy and Nowa Wieś). Olęder settlements were also located in the Osiek and Międzyłęż starostwas. The area around Nowe, Grudziądz and Świecie were also thickly settled. In 1597, Olęder settlement reached Greater Poland. A settlement appeared in Ługi Ujskie, near Ujście. Four years later another appeared in Nowe Dwory, on the Wieleński family's estate. In that instance, the colonization was directly linked to Pomerania, since the Wieleński lord's wife was the widow of the Starosta of Świecie. In 1624 the Dutch reached as far as Warsaw, where they settled, among other places, on Saska Kępa. Earlier (in the second half of the 16th century), they were already in the area of Lublin (18 settlements appeared in the area of Sławatycze, on the Bug River.). Olęder settlement continued to spread up to the times of the Partitions of Poland, and even reached Volhynia in Ukraine. With the passage of time the national character of the settlers changed. While at the beginning they were almost entirely of Dutch origin (sometimes arriving directly from the Netherlands, sometimes moving on after an initial stop in Ducal Prussia), later, with increasing frequency, they were descendants of the original Dutch, born on Polish soil, and subsequently from a completely different ethnic group—most often German, sometimes Polish, and occasionally representatives of other groups. For example, in reference to Greater Poland, Rusiński wrote \\"of the Dutch nation ... it is generally difficult to speak.\\" Chodyła gives a precise figure: descendants of the Dutch in Pomerania accounted for 0.8% of settlers; Evangelical (Lutheran) Germans, for 54%; and Polish Catholics, 38%. A further 7.2% were of mixed ethnicity and faith. Most studies agree that the Partitions of Poland and subsequent period (up to the mid-19th century) was a turning point signalling the end of Olęder settlement. For example, many Mennonites abandoned the lands they had occupied in Prussia, because their religious beliefs did not allow them to perform military service, which conflicted with the ethos of such a heavily militaristic state. In addition, administrative reforms carried out by the partitioning powers eliminated the legal arrangements that constituted the distinguishing characteristic of Olęder settlements. Settlement characteristics Mid 19th-century timberframe house in Boruja Former Protestant Olęder church in Boruja Kościelna Types Considering the large differences in Olęder colonization in different regions and at different times, it is hard to speak of a single type of village or economic activity. Everything depended on local conditions (the requirements of the terrain and the character of land cleared for sowing or pasture), and the background of the settlers. In the case of villages on terrain that had been drained, most often one finds buildings constructed in a straight line, with farms located between the river and a road running parallel. Each settler received a thin strip of land located at a right angle to the river or other body of water. If the chief task of the colonists was clearing forest lands, the land owner would designate a specified area, and the settler would choose himself the best place to make a clearing and would situate his farmstead there. This led to the appearance of so-called \\"zabudowa kolonijna\\", and in effect the village had a dispersed character. In the earliest period of settlement, on the fertile soil of Prussia, large and wealthy farms prevailed. In a later period, especially in the valley of the Vistula River, there appeared ever more frequently small, poor and more dispersed farms. As regards the type of buildings, that depended strongly on the ethnicity of the colonists. Szałygin distinguished three types: * Frisian – farm buildings located under a shared roof, with the residential part set at an angle (for example, in the shape of a cross or of the letter \\"L\\") * German – similar to the case of Frisian farms, the residence and the farm buildings were located under one roof, but in a straight line (one long building, the so-called Langhof) * Polish – separated residence and farm buildings, scattered around the farm, most often in a quadrilateral. Górak points out the pros and cons of the Frisian and German types of farm. On the one hand, such placement of the buildings facilitated work and communication, especially in the rainy season or winter, when it was possible to maintain the farm without going outdoors (except to draw water). On the other hand, there is no way to ignore the terrible sanitary conditions and discomfort (especially the stench) resulting from having livestock living so close by. If the settlers came from the Netherlands, and their task was flood control and draining flooded terrain, they applied certain typical methods of protecting their farms against high water. Buildings were located on an elevated platform, raised using dirt from excavating canals and drainage ponds. In the vicinity, they planted poplars and willows, whose purpose was to stop ice floes in the river during melts. The residential portion of the building was always close to the river, or pointed upstream, so that in case of flood the water would flow first through the residential portion, then through the rest of the farm buildings, and finally spill out onto the fields, which helped to keep the building clean. In discussing characteristic buildings of the Olęder settlement, one must also mention houses with open passageways on the groundfloor, and windmills (often based on Dutch designs) – the distinguishing contribution of the Dutch and Frisian immigrants to the Polish rural landscape (especially in Żuławy).  Legal regulation and village organization  Because the Olęder settlement was not monolithic, either with regard to ethnicity, religion or economics, the basic distinguishing characteristic of that type of colonization was the legal conditions regulating both the relationships of the settlement to the broader world and its internal affairs. =Legal relations= Settlement contracts and leases The legal foundation and mark of the beginning of settlement was the settlement \\"privilege\\" (also called the \\"contract\\" (kontract) or \\"law\\" (prawo), which was rendered in Latin as the privilegium or ius, and in German as the Gerichtigkeit), which was issued in the case of a significant majority of settlements. It usually took a ceremonial and ornamental form, being drawn up on parchment and appropriately stamped with official seals, either placed directly on the document or on cords attached to the document. From a formal legal point of view, this document was not a binding contract, but rather a unilateral declaration expressing the will of the land owner. De facto, however, its contents reflected the agreement of both sides. In this regard, the most important distinguishing factor of olęder settlement is the fact that the second party was not a zasadzcza (that is, a figure in medieval Poland who acted as a sort of headman of a village, and intermediary between the land owner and his peasants), but rather the community of settlers acting collectively, or their representative acting on their behalf. The original document remained in the hands of the land owner, although it was often recopied into the appropriate \\"land book,\\" since the land owner was obligated to produce a duplicate in case the original was lost or destroyed. Contracts were drawn up in German, Polish or Latin. German or Latin appear most often in Royal Prussia (although contracts in Polish were also found there). The Polish language dominated elsewhere in the Kingdom of Poland. In Greater Poland, around 22% of contracts were written in German, and one can even find contracts written both in German and Polish. Most often contracts were written only at the outset of settlement, although situations did occur—especially in later periods—where a contract's purpose was to recognize legally an already existing situation, such as the rights and relations of settlers already living on the land owner's lands. It also happened that a land owner would extend the new Olęder law to peasants who had been living on given lands for some time. The contract precisely regulated relations of the Olęder community with the land owner and with other persons and institutions. One basic issue was the conditions on which the settlers were given tenure of lands (dzierżawa). At the beginning of the period of Olęder settlement, land was delivered to the settlers for a specified period, usually from a few dozen to 60 years (although it also occurred that Olęder settlers were given the land only for a few years—as a test period—and if the settlement was successful, the tenure was extended. In later periods, often tenure was turned into emphyteusis, often in perperuity. (In Roman and civil law, an emphyteusis was a contract by which a landed estate was leased to a tenant, either in perpetuity or for a long term of years, upon the reservation of an annual rent, and upon condition that the lessee should improve the property; the real right by which a person is entitled to enjoy another's estate as if it were his own, and to dispose of its substance, as far as can be done without deteriorating it. This occurred both in cases of extended contracts of tenure, as well as in the founding of new Olęder settlements. (Rusiński gives as an example Olędry Róża, in Greater Poland, settled before 1624). Such tenure was not only perpetual, but also heritable and alienable, although nothing could be done that would harm the interests of the land owner.) In return for tenure of the land, the settler paid the land owner the so-called wkupne (also called the gottespfenik) While in Royal Prussia and Kuyavia the wkupne had to be paid before the first assumption of tenure, and also at each subsequent extension, in Greater Poland Olęder settlers paid the land owner the so-called Gruntgeld only upon converting tenure for a term of years into tenure in perpetuity. For the use of the land, the community had to pay the land owner an annual rent (czynsz), specified in the settlement contract. (Rent usually were paid only in money; rents in kind were rare outside of Greater Poland). Frequently, at the founding of a settlement, the land owner gave the settlers a few years to get established, foregoing collection of rents during that period (the so- called wolnizna). In only a few cases were Olęder settlers also obligated to provide labor, and even then to a limited degree. Personal and legal relationships The Olęder settlers were free persons. They were not dependent upon the land owner, as underscored in the majority of contracts for settling new villages. They could, at any time of their choice, sell their farm and depart the property. The situation is not entirely clear regarding existing inhabitants of a village to which the Olęder law was subsequently extended. For example, the inhabitants of Olędrów Chorzępowa, on the Sieraków estate, theoretically could sell their farms (and perhaps depart the property), but the settlement contract did not clearly describe them as free people, and an inventory of the estate made a few years later counts some of the farmers as serfs. Minor judicial matters generally were tried before the local government of the Olęder community. However, the land owner reserved the right to hear the matter himself in the case of serious crimes (robbery, arson, murder, assault causing bodily harm, etc.) The land owner's court was also the court of review for appeals from the decision of the community. That legal arrangement placed the Olęder settler on a somewhat higher level than an enserfed peasant, who did not have access to community justice. Only rarely were Olędrzy without the right to settle any legal questions. Such was the case on Saska Kępa, where only the mayor and the land owner's clerk were entitled to judge disputes. On royal estates, in case of a conflict with the starosta in charge of administering the estate for the king, the Olędrzy could appeal to the royal referendary court (sąd referendarski), a right which they invoked frequently. In the case of noble estates, nothing is known regarding the regulatory conditions allowing appeal from decisions of the land owner. However, almost certainly the Olędrzy had the capacity on their own initiative to file a complaint in the civic and land courts (urzęd grodzki i ziemski), in contrast to serfs who could file such a complaint only in the presence of the land owner himself.  Faith, public and religious obligations  Olęder settlers identified with different Christian sects. This is the case both with the first colonists, from the Netherlands and Frisia (most often Anabaptists and Mennonites), and with the later, ethnically different peasants (Lutherans and Roman Catholics). In general, they enjoyed freedom of religion, which after all was one of the reasons for the original Dutch colonization. The great majority of settlement contracts contained the limitation that the settlers were not allowed to prevent Catholic laborers they employed from participating in Holy Mass or other church visits. Only rarely did a founder interfere with the colonists' freedom to carry out their own religious observances (for example, the Warsaw authorities not only prohibited the Olędrzy from building a Protestant church, but also from holding services, either privately or publicly. They were required to participate in Catholic services.). Even if an Olęder settlement was populated by non-Catholic peasants, most often the settlement was within the jurisdiction of Catholic Church administration. Consequently, both Catholics and Lutherans were required to make certain payments (in return for which, Lutherans were, in certain situations, authorized to use the services of Catholic priests). Olędrzy paid tithes or meszne, a payment for saying Mass, often made in kind but sometimes in money, and paid by all inhabitants in a parish (it was rare for both tithes and meszne to have to be paid), as well as payments for specific services (performing baptisms, marriages, burials, etc.) These were paid to the Roman Catholic Church by Lutherans even if the service was performed by a Protestant chaplain, and was treated as compensation for the reduction in Church finances. Payments for these things to the Roman Catholic Church were only abolished in 1768, when the Cardinal Laws equalized the legal rights of Catholics and dissenters. Like other peasants, Olędrzy were also required to pay certain taxes to the state (and only rarely did the land owner take that responsibility upon himself, and in those cases he may have compensated himself through higher rents). These included taxes levied per capita or per hearth, having to provide winter quarters for soldiers, and other taxes (such as those on hides or the subsidium charitativum). =Organization= Local self-government Strong self-government was one of the most fundamental distinguishing characteristics of Olęder settlement, even though there were cases where the land owner attempted to limit it (by trying to appoint a hereditary sołtys, who was a dependant of the manor), in which case the community's system of local government was closer to that of villages founded under the German Law. Most often, however, the manor respected the rights of the community granted in the settlement contract. The local government of the community consisted of the sołtys and his councillors, each called a ławnik. Most often there were two of these, rarely three and extremely seldom four.). They were not appointed by the land owner, but chosen by all the inhabitants of the settlement (although women did not have the right to vote). Local government elections were usually held annually. At times the term of office lasted two or three years. Election to an office for life was truly exceptional. On the one hand, local officials served as intermediaries between the settlement and the manor. They were directly responsible for ensuring complete and punctual fulfillment of the obligations owed to the manor, such as collecting a delivering payments and rents to the land owner. On the other hand, the sołtys and councillors managed the administration of the community and its judicial system. This was most often regulated by administrative ordinances (wilkierz), which frequently were also spelled out in the settlement contract. The legal content of these had the objective of regulating relations among the peasants, which was especially important in the context of the shared responsibility of the community to fulfill the obligations toward the land owner contained in the contract. For example, the officials of the local government were even required to remove an Olęder who neglected his land and settle somebody else there. The local government was also responsible for the care of minor orphans, with security (especially against fires) and cleanliness of the settlement. At the same time, the sołtys and councillors acted as the court of first instance for minor infractions and arguments. For all of these actions, local officials received payment from the community. Income from payments was placed in the community chest, kept by the sołtys (and keys to which were held by the councillors). Funds from the community chest were used, among other things, to cover the travel costs of jury members, as well, perhaps, as payment to a community shepherd, a night watchman, a teacher or the cost of insuring against fire.  Schools  An important distinguishing characteristic of non-Catholic Olęder settlements was the existence on their terrains of schools. Above all, these fulfilled a religious function, preparing youth to join the community of faith. Rusiński even doubts whether anything other than the catechism was taught in some schools. The school generally was located in its own building, to the construction of which the land owner agreed in the settlement contract. He also facilitated upkeep of the school by designating for it a specified area of land free of rents. For example, in Chmielinko the settlers received one-half of a huba for the school. The teacher cultivated that land, although he often also received additional contributions from the community. His duties included providing instruction in religion, and how to participate in the religion's rituals, and teaching reading, writing and arithmetic. The community sometimes took advantage of the teacher's knowledge of how to write to perform certain tasks associated with administration of the settlement: maintaining the community's records and the local government's correspondence. Surely, the teacher also sometimes acted as scribe for the personal correspondence of the peasants. It is difficult to assess the quality of instruction in the Olęder schools. In Rusiński's opinion, the manner of recruiting teachers in Olęder settlements in Greater Poland—from among weavers, innkeepers, shoekeepers or tailors in small towns who could not find work—is proof that the quality cannot have been very high. At the same time, he recognized that the fact of these schools' existence was an undeniable benefit to the community. In turn, Szałygin indicated that, for the settlers from the Netherlands the schools were a safeguard for their language, culture, traditions and Mennonite faith, which allowed them to keep their own identity and resist Polonization. However, after the partitions of Poland, Prussian policy led to their Germanization. Impact Studies thoroughly analyzing the effects of the Olęder settlement on the Polish economy are lacking. Researchers have treated the topic summarily. For example, Rusiński limits himself to the claim that, \\"as an economic phenomenon, the settlement must undoubtedly be assessed positively.\\" In turn, Szałygin points out that \\"their farms were characterized by a significantly higher efficiency, modernization and better organization of work than the farms of enserfed peasants. Precisely defining the effects of this type of colonisation is even more difficult because so far no studies have appeared that encompass the entire territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, from Ducal Prussia, through Kuyavia, Mazovia and Greater Poland to the area around Lublin. The fullest and richest work remains that of Rusiński, published in 1947, and which deals only with Greater Poland. However, there is no doubt—as proved by the willingness of land owners to grant settlement contracts to additional villages—that the Olęder settlement phenomenon had positive effects on the Polish rural economy, in two ways. First, the arrival of the colonists from the Netherlands and Friesland, with their centuries of experience in cultivating difficult floodplains, gave a push to development of Polish agriculture and livestock breeding. Second, land owners received higher incomes thanks to the higher efficiency and economic skill of free persons.

Avonhead has two primary schools (Avonhead Primary School and Merrin School, a shopping mall (Avonhead Mall), and several parks. Etymology The former Avonhead homestead in the 1890sEngineer William Bayley Bray (1812–1885) arrived in Canterbury in January 1851 on the Duke of Bronte and built a homestead at the head of the Avon River in an area with many springs, and he thus called it Avonhead. The area itself was referred to as Avonwood in early records, but Avonhead became the common term and this was formally adopted by the Waimairi County Council 1959. Parks Major parks include Avonhead Park, Crosbie Park, Hyde Park, Ferrier Park and Burnside Park. There are various smaller reserves such as Stewarts Bush, Cricklewood Reserve, Westgrove Park, Staverly Reserve, Brigadoon Reserve, Bullock Reserve and Strathean Reserve. Schools Avonhead School Avonhead School is a full primary school (years 1–8, or ages 5–13) within Avonhead, located between Ferrier park to the West and Avonhead Road to the East. The school typically has between 500 and 600 students and is a decile 7 school. Although located within Avonhead, the school zone also includes sections of the nearby suburbs of Ilam and Sockburn. Most students from Avonhead School go on to secondary schooling at Riccarton High School or Burnside High School. The school currently has 22 classrooms, a result of construction work undertaken to address issues of overcrowding which had been previously faced. These were accompanied by additional work on school facilities, including the construction of a new school hall, basketball and netball courts, which had been made necessary by the construction of classrooms on the sites of previous courts.  Merrin School  Located next to the Avonhead Mall, Merrin School is a decile 8 school with a roll of just over 500 students. Merrin is a full primary school, educating years 1 to 8. As the entirety of the school's zone is covered by Burnside High School, the majority of students go on the learn there. The school is in the planning stage of the Christchurch Schools Rebuild Programme.

Recep İvedik takes up residence in an expensive Antalya hotel to win back his childhood love. The film, which went on nationwide general release across Turkey on , was the highest grossing Turkish film of 2008. The film's titular comic character was created by Şahan Gökbakar for his Turkish comedy television show Dikkat Şahan Çıkabilir, which ran from 2005 to 2006, and has subsequently gone on to feature in a series of sequel films. The film was shot on location in Istanbul and Antalya, Turkey. Plot İvedik is a fearsome- looking uncultivated driver with a lot of aggression but a spark of goodness in him. Involved by accident in a street fight, he rescues the wallet of the owner of an Antalya luxury hotel and hitchhikes his way south to restore it to the rightful owner. Along the way he is made the object of an unlikely attempted seduction by a homosexual truck-driver, reacting with shock and innocence. Reaching the hotel to hand over the wallet, he begins his stay by shattering a porcelain vase in the hotel lobby and talks his way out of the situation in exactly the same way as earlier burlesque characters. After giving back the wallet, he is about to leave when he glimpses his childhood sweetheart Sibel (Fatma Toptaş) among a party of arriving guests and decides to take up the owner's offer of a free stay in the hotel. Gökbakar then uses İvedik to burlesque every aspect of five star hotel life. Unable to use the toilets, he pees in the ornamental flowers, drinks the hotel shampoo as well as the contents of the minibar, massages the foot of an amorous woman in mistake for Sibel's, gatecrashes women's morning fitness exercises on the beach in a ludicrous purple gown, and cuffs the heads of almost everyone who comes into contact with him. All the while he pours out a stream of inappropriate invective and obscenities. By the close of the film most middle class conventions have also been shattered, a high point being a burping contest between him and Sibel. Sibel, who is resisting her bourgeois mother's attempts to marry her off to a fiance she does not love, contains a very mild criticism of the middle class lifestyles and attitudes with which İvedik is colliding. By making a sweet nice girl like Sibel belch at full volume, Gökbakar comes closest to an outright repudiation of middle class values. The film ends with İvedik leaving the hotel. Has catharsis been achieved? No. İvedik departs more or less exactly as he arrived, presumably en route to more adventures in his next film. Yet somehow he ends up by being not so much frightening as slightly loveable—no doubt because he no longer appears wholly dangerous. It is Sibel's view of him which has changed—and that of the film audience too. Cast * Şahan Gökbakar as Recep İvedik * Fatma Toptaş as Sibel * Tuluğ Çizgen as Sibel's mother * Hakan Bilgin as Müdür Release The film opened in 230 screens across Turkey on 22 February 2008 with a first weekend gross of $5,330,000.

He is a former Minister of State for Welfare Reform in the Conservative Government of the United Kingdom. Before he joined the Conservative Party, he advised New Labour on welfare reform during its final term of office. He is a past vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS. He stepped down from his government role at the end of December 2016. Early life and education Freud is the son of Walter Freud and a great-grandson of the physician and pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. He was educated at Whitgift School, Croydon, and Merton College, Oxford, where he took a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. Career Journalism After starting out at the Western Mail, Freud worked at the Financial Times for eight years as a journalist. In 2006 Freud published autobiographical story about his work in the City of London. Finance In 1983, Freud was hired by the stockbroking firm then known as Rowe & Pitman. Later, he worked for S G Warburg, which was taken over by UBS. He was vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS before he retired.Confessions of an apologetic investment banker, The Guardian, 4 August 2006 His book Freud in the City describes his life as a merchant banker. Welfare policy In 2006, Freud was asked by Tony Blair to review the UK's welfare-to-work system. The Daily Telegraph said Blair had been \\"impressed by his role in raising finance for Eurotunnel and EuroDisney\\" while at UBS. Freud's 2007 report - dubbed 'the Freud report' but officially titled Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: options for the future of welfare to work - called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, for substantial resources to be made available to help lone parents and people on Incapacity Benefit back into work, and for a single working-age benefit payment to replace Housing Benefit, Jobseekers Allowance, etc. His central thesis was that spending on 'delivery' - such as schemes to get people back to work - would save money in the long run because there would be fewer people being paid money in the form of benefits. Freud wrote: His ideas foreshadowed the Work Programme and Universal Credit. The Daily Telegraph has claimed that \\"many of [Freud's] ideas fell victim to the fierce infighting between Mr Blair, the then Prime Minister, and Gordon Brown, his Chancellor\\". In 2008, during the banking crisis that had begun the previous year, Freud became a formal adviser to the New Labour government led by Gordon Brown. The Daily Telegraph said Freud was then asked to \\"help implement nothing less than a revolution in the welfare state\\" after a \\"sea change in Labour's thinking about the benefits system\\". His ideas were incorporated into a White Paper published later that year. Politics By February 2009 the BBC was referring to him as Sir David Freud, at which point he announced that he would switch to working with the Conservatives - the culmination of what The Guardian described as a \\"tug of war\\" between the two main political parties over Freud. The newspaper also said that the move was \\"an apparent demonstration of his belief that the Tories are more likely to implement his radical reforms\\". On 27 June 2009, he went from knight to lord after his name was put forward by the Conservative leadership. He then became a shadow minister in David Cameron's frontbench team.Lords Hansard for 29 June 2009 When the Coalition Government was formed in 2010, Freud was made Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Welfare Reform at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). In 2012, he outlined some of his thoughts on welfare reform in an interview by saying: \\"People who are poorer should be prepared to take the biggest risks, they've got least to lose. We have, through our welfare system, created a system which has made them reluctant to take risks, so we need to turn that on its head and make the system predictable so that people will take those risks\\". In the same interview, he said his primary concerns were the \\"nooks and crannies\\" in the benefits system where people could sit for long periods without ongoing scrutiny. He claimed the people who did this were: \\"The incapacity benefits, the lone parents, the people who are self-employed for year after year but only earn hundreds of pounds or a few thousand pounds, the people waiting for their work capability assessment then not going to it - all kinds of areas where people are able to have a lifestyle off benefits and actually off conditionality\\". In 2014, Labour MPs called for Freud's resignation after he was secretly recorded responding to a question posed at a fringe meeting of the Conservative Party conference. The question was whether some people with disabilities should work for a token sum in order to enjoy the non-financial advantages of engaging in the world of work, perhaps with their wages topped up by benefit payments. Freud, thinking out loud, agreed that there was a small group of disabled people who were \\"not worth the full wage\\" and said he would go away and think about it. Freud had to apologise. He said: \\"I was foolish to accept the premise of the question...I care passionately about disabled people...that is why through Universal Credit...we have increased overall spending on disabled households by £250 million, offered the most generous work allowance ever, and increased the disability addition to £360 per month\\". After the Conservatives won the general election in May 2015, Freud was promoted to Minister of State at the DWP, where he was given an enhanced role in overseeing the expansion of the Universal Credit scheme. Other appointments Along with the late Sir Martin Gilbert, Freud has acted as a long-term trustee of the Portland Trust, a not-for-profit London-based foundation set up to promote co-operation between Israel and Palestine through economic development. Between 2005 and 2008, he was its chief executive. Freud is a President of Volunteering Matters, UK's volunteering charity founded in 1962.

The business was continued by his son, Thomas Cadell (1773-1836), often referred to as Thomas Cadell the younger, who went into business with William Davies as Cadell & Davies until Davies death in 1819. Cadell continued in business until his own death in 1836. History Thomas Cadell was born in Bristol to William and Mary Cadell and baptized on 12 November 1742. On 7 March 1758, Cadell’s father apprenticed him for a fee of £105 to London bookseller and publisher Andrew Millar. Cadell became Millar's partner in April 1765, having just finished his seven-year apprenticeship, and took over the business with the help of Millar's assistant, Robert Lawless, upon Millar’s death in 1768. Now a successful bookseller, Cadell married the daughter of Reverend Thomas Jones on 1 April 1769.Dille Cadell ran his business out of 141 Strand for over 25 years, sometimes partnering with William Strahan and later Andrew Strahan. He published works by notable authors, whom he paid well. For example, Cadell and Strahan published Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776–88), Henry Mackenzie’s The Man of Feeling (1771) and the poetry of Robert Burns. Cadell wrote to Gibbon in 1787: “I had rather risk my fortune with a few such Authors as Mr Gibbon, Dr Robertson, D Hume … than be the publisher of a hundred insipid publications”. He also published works by the jurist William Blackstone, the philosopher David Hume, the author and critic Samuel Johnson, the philosopher and economist Adam Smith, the novelist Tobias Smollett, the novelist Frances Burney, the historian Catharine Macaulay, and the moralist Hannah More. He also published the novels of Charlotte Turner Smith until her works became too radical, refusing to publish Desmond in 1792. Cadell had a strong relationship with Johnson. Cadell was part of the group of booksellers who convinced the famous critic to write Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets (1779–81). He also published Johnson’s political tracts of the 1770s and, together with Strahan, his A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775). After Johnson died, Cadell published Hester Thrale Piozzi's Letters and Anecdotes about Johnson. Cadell was well liked by other booksellers and he helped establish the booksellers’ dining club which met each month at the Shakespeare tavern in Wych Street. Together, they prosecuted infringements on their copyrights from Scottish and Irish printers. In January 1786, Cadell’s wife died. The couple had two children. His daughter married Dr. Charles Lucas Eldridge, chaplain to George III. His son, Thomas Cadell the younger, took over the family business when his father retired in 1793. After his retirement, Cadell served on the boards of several philanthropic institutions, such as the Foundling Hospital. In March 1798, he was elected alderman of Walbrook and served as sheriff from 1800 to 1801. He was also master of the Stationers’ Company from 1798 to 1799 and stock-keeper in 1800. Cadell died at his home on 27 December 1802 from an asthma attack. Notes Bibliography Dille, Catherine. “Thomas Cadell, the elder (1742-1802)”. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

It was located at 1 Flower Street on the western bank of the Delaware River just north of the Commodore Barry Bridge. A toxic fire at the site in 1978 burned out of control for several days and resulted in 43 injured firefighters and criminal charges for the owner of the site. The first responders to the fire suffered long term health consequences and higher than normal cancer rates. In 1983, the site became a Superfund cleanup site and was remediated in stages over several years. It was removed from the National Priorities List in 1989. In 2004, it was turned into a parking lot for the city's Barry Bridge Park with approval from the state and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). History From about 1950 to the early 1970s, the site was the location of Eastern Rubber Reclaiming, a rubber recycling facility. The property owner, Melvin Wade, turned the site into an illegal industrial waste storage and disposal facility which operated until 1978. ABM Disposal Company paid Wade $1.00 to $1.50 per 55-gallon drum to store industrial waste on his property. ABM Disposal was not regulated by the state and had a long criminal record of dumping abuses in the Philadelphia area. Wade accumulated 100 to 150 drums per week until approximately 10,000 drums were stored on site. The drums leaked and workers dumped their contents onto the ground or into various trenches, severely contaminating soil and ground water. More than 3 million gallons of cyanide, benzene, toluene, sodium copper cyanide, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other chemicals were stored on the site along with thousands of tires. 1978 Fire In February 1978, an intense fire at the site destroyed one building and damaged two others where drums of waste were stored. The burning chemicals produced multi-colored smoke and noxious fumes. The Chester Fire Department mounted an aggressive attack but were driven back by exploding 55-gallon drums and disabling smoke. Local hospitals treated 43 firefighters for injuries sustained during the fire. The immediate effects of exposure to the toxic fumes included raw, burning throats; vomiting; a quickly forming red, itchy rash; and seared eyes and nasal passages. Over 200 first responders including firemen, police and paramedics were exposed to the toxic fumes. First responders to the fire experienced many health problems in subsequent years including several deaths from rare cancers. Cancer rates of firemen at the fire or cleanup were five to six times the norm. In 1980, Melvin Wade was convicted of risking a catastrophe, failing to prevent a catastrophe and violating the Clean Water Act by polluting the Delaware River. He was sentenced to one to two years in prison and fined $30,000. Cleanup In late 1981 and early 1982, the EPA conducted two emergency cleanups in which workers removed an estimated 5,000 gallons of PCB-contaminated waste, 10,000 gallons of other hazardous wastes for incineration and 155 tons of contaminated solids. In 1984, a long-term plan was developed for the site cleanup which was managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). The work took place in 1987. Tires, tankers, debris piles, and buildings were removed, decontaminated, and disposed of. Contaminated soil was removed to depths with acceptable levels of contamination or to the level of the water table. The site was leveled, filled and graded, then covered with topsoil and seeded to minimize erosion. The EPA, in conjunction with the state, removed the site from the National Priorities List in 1989. In 2004, with EPA and state approval, the site was given drainpipes to clear stormwater and paved with asphalt to create a parking lot for the city's Barry Bridge Park. In 2008, the Barry Bridge Park site adjacent to Wade Dump was selected as the site of Talen Energy Stadium, home of the Philadelphia Union Major League Soccer franchise. In 2014, a five-year review of the site concluded that the site continues to be protective of human health and the environment. The EPA and PADEP continue to monitor the site.

Resnick is married to Stewart Resnick, who is her business partner, and through their holding company The Wonderful Company, they own the POM Wonderful and Fiji Water brands, Wonderful Pistachios and Almonds, Wonderful Halos, JUSTIN Wines, Landmark Wines, JNSQ Wines and the Teleflora floral wire service company. Early life Resnick was born Lynda Rae Harris to a Jewish family in Baltimore, Maryland, but raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Jack H. Harris, worked as a film distributor during the 1950s; he is known for producing The Blob, which later became a cult favorite. Her mother, Muriel (née Goodman), was an interior designer.Los Angeles Times: \\"Muriel Harris Obituary\\" March 13, 2011 Because of her father's occupation, Resnick, at the age of four, had a recurring role on The Horn & Hardart Children's Hour broadcast from WCAU-TV in Philadelphia. Resnick graduated from Harriton High School, and the family moved to southern California. After a brief stint at a local college, Resnick took a job at the in-house ad agency for Sunset House catalog. Resnick founded an advertising agency, Lynda Limited, at the age of 19. Pentagon Papers Resnick, then Lynda Sinay, began doing occasional work for the antiwar movement during the Vietnam War era. Her friend, Daniel Ellsberg, asked to use her copy machine on nights and weekends in order to distribute top-secret military documents. Ellsberg gave these documents to The New York Times, which then published them. Dubbed the Pentagon Papers, they detailed aspects of the war hidden from the public and damaged the credibility of the presidents involved. Resnick was designated an un-indicted co- conspirator for her role and pursued by prosecutors for two years. Legal actions were eventually dropped. Career and companies Lynda Resnick has been involved in many companies. The Wonderful Company, formerly Roll Global, is a holding company which the Resnicks use to facilitate their various business ventures. Notable brands controlled by the Resnicks include POM Wonderful, Fiji Water, Wonderful Halos and Wonderful Pistachios. They also operate large industrial citrus and nut farms in California. The Resnicks met while he was president of American Protection Industries, Los Angeles, California, and she was pitching her ad agency to get his business. The Resnicks purchased Teleflora in 1979, at which time Lynda left her advertising job to become the company's executive vice president of marketing and eventually president. As Vice-Chair and co-owner of Teleflora's holding company, Resnick has been involved with securing flagship TV sponsorship roles. She won a Gold Effie Award for her idea to pair fresh flowers with a collectible keepsake container, while her Mother's Day special on NBC resulted in another Effie win. January 2009 saw her company's first Super Bowl advertisement, which was voted one of the best Super Bowl ads by several newspapers, blogs, and online fan sites. Franklin Mint The Resnicks purchased the Franklin Mint in 1984; Lynda began directing the company's international marketing efforts, a position she held until 2000. She influenced a new business plan of providing products that delivered \\"emotional satisfaction\\", such as the high-end collectible doll business. According to the Encyclopedia of American Women in Business, the first run of a Scarlett O'Hara (Gone with the Wind)-inspired doll generated $35 million in sales. Also during her tenure, licensing was arranged for products related to the Louvre art museum in Paris, the Vatican, board games like Monopoly and Scrabble, classic cars, and famous people like John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Marilyn Monroe. In 1997 Tiger Woods successfully stopped the Franklin Mint from selling a commemorative medal of his win in the 1997 Masters Tournament. The Resnicks sold the Franklin Mint in 2006.  POM Wonderful  According to her memoir, she acquired a pistachio orchard that also contained some Wonderful variety pomegranate trees in California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1996, intrigued by folklore, she began to sponsor medical research regarding the pomegranate's health effects. By 2000 there was research published with findings regarding effects of regular pomegranate consumption. Resnick designed the POM Wonderful logo, and her design team developed an hourglass- shape bottle, the company later expanding into other liquid products and pills.  Fiji Water  The Resnicks acquired the Fiji Water business in 2004, after which Lynda supervised marketing that focused on promoting the uniqueness and exotic nature of the water. According to Resnick's book, sales of Fiji Water soon increased by 300% by 2008, becoming the largest imported bottled water brand in the United States. In response to bad publicity regarding the Fiji brand and bottled water in general Resnick introduced a promotional campaign touting an environmental policy and plans for a reduced carbon footprint through a series of press releases.  Wonderful Halos  In 2013 the Resnicks launched Wonderful Halos mandarins, with a $220 million facility in the San Joaquin Valley capable of processing 19 million mandarins a day. By 2017 Halos was the #1 segment brand, forecast to have around 70-80% market share by 2018. Company executives credit Resnick with the choice to retain Roll Global's mandarin operations in 2013 despite strong competition from existing brands, and as the key architect of Halos branding. In 2017, Halos accounted for around three-quarters of growth in the mandarin category, and 12% of total produce sales growth.  Wonderful Pistachios and Almonds  Wonderful Pistachios & Almonds is the world's largest vertically integrated pistachio and almond grower and processor, cultivating and harvesting more than of pistachio and almond orchards and delivering more than 450 million pounds of nuts globally each year. Known for its Get Crackin' campaign, Wonderful Pistachios was the United States' fastest-growing snack brand and the number-one tree nut brand in 2018.  JNSQ Wines  In 2019, the Resnicks launched a female-focused luxury wine brand, JNSQ (named for the French phrase \\"je ne sais quoi\\"). JNSQ Rosé Cru and JNSQ Sauvignon Blanc made their debut alongside the Fall/Winter 2019 collection from California-born designers Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Rodarte, who brought their show to Los Angeles (instead of New York Fashion Week) on February 5. Lynda Resnick described the brand as \\"created specifically for millennial women and older Gen Z'ers and the milestones they are celebrating in their blossoming and exhilarating lives. It's a wine made with that same shared quality of 'je ne sais quoi' that makes each of these ladies unique, memorable and unstoppable.” Designed to be sustainably reused, the curvaceous wine bottle was inspired by a vintage perfume bottle and comes with a rose- or grape-shaped glass stopper. \\"We live in an age where we don't want single-use things; we want things that last,\\" Resnick, who is heavily involved in the product design, told The Hollywood Reporter. Personal philanthropy Metal casket donated by the Resnicks to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2009 Resnick is a \\"life trustee\\" of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Board of Trustees. She is a trustee emeritus of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In September 2008, she and her husband announced a $45 million gift to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the construction of a new exhibition pavilion, as well as $10 million in artworks. She is on the executive board of UCLA Medical Sciences, the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the Milken Family Foundation. In 2005 the Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital was named for Resnick and her husband in honor of their involvement. They made a $4 million donation to Children's Hospital Central California in 2006. She is on the board of trustees and chair of the marketing and communications committee at the Aspen Institute. In 2009 they announced the opening of a pre-school billed as one of the first in the US to be environmentally friendly. The same year they also announced plans to bring a charter school, Paramount Bard Academy, to the Central Valley. At Caltech's 2009 graduation ceremonies, the university announced that the Resnicks had donated $20 million towards a \\"sustainability center\\" to be named after themselves. In 2018, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles announced a $30 million gift from Lynda and Stewart Resnick to help pay for a renovation and expansion project. In September 2019, Lynda Resnick and her husband pledged $750 million to the California Institute of Technology for environmental sustainability research.  Central Valley philanthropy  Resnick and The Wonderful Company have made significant improvements to the communities that dot California's Central Valley since 2010, especially in the city of Lost Hills, where half of the homes have at least one family member working at The Wonderful Company. Over the years, they have given over $100 million to two charter schools, and $20 million to an agriculture-career college prep program for seven public high schools in California's Central Valley. Forbes noted that between 2010 and 2015 \\"the company has helped 55,000 students in the region through programs like college prep, scholarships and summer camps. One education program they built and partially funded, which was awarded an $8.5 million grant from the state in June 2015 to help them expand it, gives 200 students a year partial agricultural education and college scholarships to gain technical experience.

In 2019 the company increased its minimum pay to $15 an hour for all of its California workers, three years ahead of the state-mandated deadline. In 2006 Resnick introduced the Wonderful Giving Program, allowing employees to direct donations to local charities. The largest local recipient of donations under the program is Wasco Union High School, which during the past twelve years has received more than $210,000 thanks to Wonderful Giving. Lost Hills Elementary School, the program's second-leading recipient, has taken in $141,000. Other local nonprofits that have benefited financially from the program include the Bakersfield Homeless Center ($77,852), the Bakersfield Ronald McDonald House ($70,633), Marley Mutts Dog Rescue ($63,586), Youth 2 Leaders ($62,400) and the Kern County chapter of the Wounded Heroes Fund ($34,310). In 2018, the Resnicks donated $2.5 million to the Fresno Community Food Bank, the largest donation the agency has received in its 26-year history. In 2016 the US Chamber of Commerce recognized Resnick and The Wonderful Company with their Corporate Citizenship Award for their work in community improvement. Personal life Resnick has been married twice. Her first marriage to publisher Hershel Sinay ended in divorce in 1969. They had two children: Jason Sinay and Jonathan Sinay.UCLA Health System: \\"Hershel Sinay\\" retrieved June 7, 2014 Resnick's second marriage is to Stewart Resnick, who is also her business partner. They live in Beverly Hills and have a home in Aspen, Colorado. Personal memoir In 2009, Resnick, with Francis Wilkinson, co-authored a book, Rubies in the Orchard: How to Uncover the Hidden Gems in Your Business, which details her life by explaining marketing and business ideas she used to build successful brands. In a U.S. News & World Report article, Resnick explained that her book promotes a concept she labels transparency: \\"Transparency is very new...you have to be a good citizen of the planet. You have to give back.\\" Criticisms Growing water-intensive nut tree crops (a single almond requires of water) in the Central Valley drew criticism during the 2011–17 California drought. According to Forbes, Wonderful Company uses \\"at least 120 billion gallons [] a year, two-thirds on nuts, enough to supply San Francisco's 852,000 residents for a decade.\\" As part of their efforts to minimize this impact, the Resnicks have been investing heavily in the growth of the local economy and nutrition centers. As The New York Times notes, \\"in Lost Hills there are new health centers, new pre-K facilities, new housing projects, new gardens, new sidewalks and lights, a new community center and a new soccer field.\\" In addition, the Resnicks own a majority stake in the Kern Water Bank, \\"one of California's largest underground water storage facilities. It is capable of storing 500 billion gallons [] of water. They have also partnered with the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project to bring water to Kern County, spending $35 million in recent years to buy up more water from nearby districts to replenish the Central Valley's supplies.Forbes Magazine: America's Nuttiest Billionaire Couple: Amid Drought, Stewart And Lynda Resnick Are Richer Than Ever, November 23, 2015 At the same time as exporting almonds to Asia and other locations, they import Fiji bottled water from the South Pacific. Some foreign conservationists criticize the Resnicks for \\"hogging the archipelago's precious water supply... while island natives didn't always have water to drink themselves, due to crumbling and insufficient infrastructure.\\" However, local officials support the investment Fiji water makes in the economy as \\"a critical contributor to the Fijian economy... and a gift to the Fijian tourism industry.\\" In addition, their claims for the POM pomegranate drink have been contested. According to Forbes, \\"The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint in 2010 that the Resnicks' POM Wonderful had used deceptive advertising when marketing the antioxidant-rich drink as being able to treat, prevent or reduce the risk of heart disease, prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction. In 2012 a federal judge agreed that some of the ads were misleading. In 2013 FTC commissioners denied the Resnicks' appeal. In October of this year, the Resnicks asked the Supreme Court to take the case.\\" In May 2016 the Supreme Court declined to take the case.\\"LA Times: Pom Wonderful case not wonderful enough, Supreme Court says\\" May 4, 2016 References External links * * Lynda Resnick's Huffington Post column Category:American business executives Category:American women business executives Category:American company founders Category:Businesspeople from Los Angeles Category:The Wonderful Company Category:Living people Category:American billionaires Category:Female billionaires Category:American bloggers Category:American women bloggers Category:American women philanthropists Category:Philanthropists from California Category:Jewish American philanthropists Category:People associated with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Category:Businesspeople from Philadelphia Category:People from Beverly Hills, California Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:21st-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century businesswomen Category:21st-century businesswomen Category:1943 births Category:Harriton High School alumni ","title":"Lynda Resnick"},{"id":"21559117","text":"is a railway station in the town of Wakasa, Mikatakaminaka District, Fukui Prefecture, Japan, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West).

It is a Victorian Gothic Revival stone building with polychromatic decoration. The west tower has five stages with the stump of a spire, and the chancel has paintings by Henry Holiday. The church was badly damaged by enemy action during World War II but was fully restored by 1951. It is a Grade II* listed building. History Building of All Saints church was begun in 1852 for the Reverend Dr Samuel Walker, to designs by architect William White, working with Sir George Gilbert Scott. The church was to be the centerpiece of the development now known as Colville and Powis Squares. Walker was deeply religious and his vision was for a church without pew rents for the newly built neighbourhood. Walker ran short of money and was eventually declared bankrupt. The building was left unfinished for several years, lacking a spire, and remaining unfurnished, in which time it was nicknamed \\"All- Sinners-in-the-Mud\\". All Saints was eventually completed in 1861 for The Reverend John Light of Trinity College Dublin, at a cost of £25,000. The spire in White's original designs was never completed. The tower is high and is said to resemble the Medieval Gothic Belfry of Bruges, Belgium. Walter Passmore (1867–1946), a singer and actor best known for his comic baritone roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, was a choirboy at All Saints. World War II and The Blitz All Saints suffered serious bomb damage in The Blitz of World War II, along with neighbouring buildings including Pinehurst Court, at 1–9 Colville Gardens. The first bombs fell on 26 September 1940, and the church was hit again in March and June 1944. The Lady chapel and the south transept chapel were destroyed. Restoration work was completed in 1951. Clergy From 1931 to 1961 the vicar was the flamboyant Fr John Twisaday, who established the high church worship tradition at All Saints. The present vicar is Fr Philip Corbett SSC, who was inducted in 2019. All Saints' parish is part of the Anglo-Catholic Forward in Faith movement.

On 2 August 1958, a set of two cars, 194 and 198, of the Gullfisk type was traveling the Lilleaker Line ( Lilleakerbanenen) – Østensjø Line (Østensjøbanen) route from Bøler to Jar. This connection was opened in 1937 and the Gullfisk cars introduced in 1939. As the tram braked as it approached Totengata a technical malfunction caused arcing and a fire erupted in the front of car 198 which was the latter car. The exit door, being operated by the tram driver who was seated in the lead car, remained closed for a few, critical seconds as passengers were struck by panic. The disaster claimed the lives of five people; seventeen were injured. Following the disaster, fire extinguishers, better emergency exits and emergency door openers became mandatory in all public transport.

Route description US-95 continues into Idaho from southeastern Oregon as an undivided two-lane highway for the majority of its length. As it is the state's primary north–south highway, Idaho is in the process of widening US-95 to an Interstate-style divided four-lane highway, from the Oregon state line in the southwest to Eastport at the northern border with Canada at Kingsgate, British Columbia. In Oregon, US-95 continues south, crosses into Nevada at McDermitt, and meets Interstate 80 at Winnemucca. Oregon border to New Meadows US-95 between Jordan Valley, Oregon and Marsing, Idaho US-95 departs Malheur County, Oregon, and enters Idaho in the high desert of Owyhee County, Idaho Historical Markers - Owyhee Country about southwest of Boise. It progresses north-northeast to just west of Marsing, where it meets with the southern terminus of State Highway 55. US-95 then turns briefly west, then north to Homedale, and crosses the Snake River before a junction with concurrent US-20 and US-26 as it passes through Parma. US-95 runs north concurrent with US-20/26 for . As it proceeds north near Idaho's western border, US-95 crosses Interstate 84 (exit 3) and US-30 before proceeding north through Payette and Weiser. It continues on to Midvale, Cambridge, and Council, then climbs into the Payette National Forest, passing the Tamarack sawmill site, and turns east to New Meadows. Here, US-95 joins with Highway 55, the two-lane undivided route that connects to Boise through McCall, Cascade and Horseshoe Bend. The elevation at the junction in New Meadows is above sea level. Meadows Valley to Lewiston US-95 continues north through Meadows Valley north of the junction (roadcam), then descends with the Little Salmon River to Riggins, tree-sparse but surrounded by mile- high mountains (vertical drop). Immediately after Riggins, the highway crosses the main Salmon River and enters the Pacific Time Zone; the current bridge was completed in 1999. US-95 northbound gradually descends with the widening river until White Bird, where it climbs in to the cut at the top of White Bird Hill, peaking at an elevation of (roadcam) with an average gradient of over 7%. The steeper, straighter, and faster multi-lane grade was opened in 1975, after ten challenging years of construction. The two-lane road of 1921 to the east was first paved in 1938; it left the Salmon River at White Bird Creek following it up through the town of White Bird, and then gradually climbed the grade in twice the distance, with multiple switchback curves. The arcs, if combined, would form 37 full 360° circles, an average of 950° per mile (590° per km).Idaho Historical Markers - White Bird Following the completion of the new steel bridge over White Bird Creek, the new routing opened in June 1975, ending a decade of construction. The new Lewiston grade to the north was finished in just over two years. North of the summit, US-95 descends in a steep but relatively short descent (roadcam) to the Camas Prairie and Grangeville at . The highway then travels northwest towards Cottonwood, whose bypass was finished in 1976, then enters the Nez Perce Indian Reservation. New route construction in the early 1990s bypassed the main streets of Ferdinand and Craigmont. The new routing is now above, rather than in, the curvy Lawyers Creek Canyon between the cities, crossing the canyon on an elevated bridge (photo) constructed in 1991.Idaho Transportation Dept. - Bridge deck rehabilitation - 2010-08-06 - accessed 2011-09-25 Lawyers Canyon is named after Chief Lawyer (c.1801–76) of the Nez Perce, nicknamed for his skill in dealing with the encroaching whites; he is buried in Kamiah. US-95 winds its way westward across the high prairie, near the many timber railroad trestles of the Camas Prairie Railroad, to just east of Winchester. Here, at just under , the highway turns northward and descends over 3,000 vertical feet (900 m), mostly in the Lapwai Canyon (photos), passing Culdesac, Lapwai, and Spalding at . Until 1960, US-95 was routed through Winchester and descended Culdesac Hill (), considered the worst of the three major grades (White Bird, Lewiston), all of which were extremely twisty. The new route through Lapwai Canyon was built in three years and reduced the distance by over and saved 25 minutes of driving time. After Spalding, it then proceeds towards the bridge over the Clearwater River to join with US-12 and depart the reservation. The current bridge for US-12 upstream at Arrow replaced the old Spalding bridge ice jams on the river a decade earlier After crossing the Clearwater on the new Spalding bridge (1962), US-95 joins with US-12 for along its north bank, heading westward, adding lanes, and gradually descending toward Lewiston. About midway along the co-sign, the reservation is departed; the highways split several miles later at Lewiston's northeast edge. US-12 briefly turns south to re-cross the river into the city center, and then west to cross the Snake River into Clarkston, Washington. Lewiston grade to Canada Lewiston and Clarkston, WA (old grade in foreground) US-95 turns northeast, then westward to climb a steep grade, gaining over in , ascending to the southern edge of the rolling Palouse region. The multi-lane grade (averaging over 7%) was opened on October 28, 1977, after 27 months of construction and two decades of planning. It replaced the Lewiston Spiral Highway, a narrow and switchback-laden 1917 route to the west with 64 spiral curves and about twice the length; it is visible from a scenic overlook. Similar to the White Bird Hill grade, the descending southbound lanes on the new route have three \\"runaway truck ramps\\" to halt any vehicles that experience brake failure. Just north of the Lewiston grade is a junction with US-195, which proceeds north in Washington to Pullman and Spokane. US-95 continues north in Idaho on the Palouse as a four-lane divided highway (roadcam), completed in October 2007 to Thorn Creek Road (), midway between Genesee and Moscow. It then reverts to a two-lane undivided roadway for several miles until Moscow, home of the University of Idaho. Scheduled to be completed first, the divided highway construction between Thorn Creek and Moscow was put on hold, due to new right-of-way and environmental impact concerns. University of Idaho Administration Building in Moscow In Moscow, US-95 is diverted a block to either side of Main Street onto multi-lane one-way arterials: northbound on Washington Street, southbound on Jackson Street. The original couplets of 1981 used existing streets and were later modified to eliminate sharp right angle turns which were difficult for large trucks to safely manage. The north end couplets were completed in the early 1990s, the south end in 2000. The construction on the northeast couplet forced the demolition of a noted Moscow watering hole's original west end in January 1991, after staving off its elimination for over a decade. North of Moscow, US-95 resumes as an undivided two-lane highway. As it leaves Latah County, it gradually departs the Palouse and enters the lake country region of the north Panhandle. As it enters Benewah County, US-95 enters the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation. US-95 intersects State Highway 5 in Plummer. US-95 becomes a four-lane divided highway as it leaves Worley and has an interchange with State Highway 58. This recently completed section bypasses the tribal casino and its Circling Raven golf course. US-95 continues north as a divided highway until just south of the Spokane River, where US-95 enters Coeur d'Alene. Lake Coeur d'Alene US-95 becomes an arterial street and crosses over Interstate 90 Business (Northwest Boulevard) at an interchange. US-95 crosses Interstate 90 at exit 12 and becomes a divided highway north to Hayden, then as an undivided highway past State Highway 54 and Farragut State Park. After crossing Lake Pend Oreille on the Sandpoint Long Bridge, US-95 enters Sandpoint and has a junction with US-2. The two routes run concurrent for , until a few miles after Bonners Ferry, where US-2 heads east into Montana and southeast to Libby, while US-95 continues north for to the Canada–US border at Eastport. At the border, US-95 meets BC 95, which continues northeastward in British Columbia to Cranbrook. As of 2019, ITD had started a construction project at US-95's intersection with State Route 53 to reconfigure the intersection, replacing the current signalized intersection with a Single Point Urban Interchange. The project will straighten out ID 53 over the nearby train tracks, remove an intersection with Garwood Rd with a new bridge, and extend the frontage road on the east side to Garwood Rd. History US-95 was established in 1926 as one of the original routes in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) system of national highways. It originally terminated at U.S. Route 30 north of Parma, near the Oregon state line, and was wholly located within Idaho except for a small segment in Washington state northwest of Lewiston. Prior to the designation, the north–south highway was part of State Highway 24 (the number has since re-purposed for another highway). A proposal to extend the highway south was considered by the AASHTO in 1937, but deferred until 1940 while routes in Oregon were improved. US-95 then was extended through Oregon and Nevada to California, terminating near Blythe. A proposal to expand the newly-constructed expressway sections of US 95 into a full-fledged Interstate Highway was considered by the state government in the late 1980s. Since the 1990s, sections of the highway between Coeur d'Alene and Sandpoint have been widened to four lanes and gained limited-access grade separation.

It represents the tracking process of a mobility node (MN) involving a single targeted node using a Random Waypoint. This technology is often used in law enforcement and signal source tracking.  Mobility model  The Pursue Mobility Model simulates scenarios where several nodes attempt to capture single mobile node ahead. This mobility model could be used in target tracking and law enforcement. The node being pursued (i.e., target node) moves freely according to the Random waypoint model. By directing the velocity towards the position of the targeted node, the pursuer nodes (i.e., seeker nodes) try to intercept the target node. This can be demonstrated in the case of police officers trying to locate a criminal with the target being pursued serving as an MN moving based on a specific synthetic single node mobility model. The Pursue Mobility Model consists of a single update equation for the new position of each Moving Node: new position = old position + acceleration(target—old position) + randomvector. Example: Nodes chase after a single target that may or may not be moving. Here we have a collection of robots (nodes) trying to catch a single robot that acts as a target. This kind of behavior is found in multiple robotics activities (e.g.: people tracking and so on).

The Hellas quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Hellas quadrangle is also referred to as MC-28 (Mars Chart-28). The Hellas quadrangle covers the area from 240° to 300° west longitude and 30° to 65° south latitude on the planet Mars. Within the Hellas quadrangle lies the classic features Hellas Planitia and Promethei Terra. Many interesting and mysterious features have been discovered in the Hellas quadrangle, including the giant river valleys Dao Vallis, Niger Vallis, Harmakhis, and Reull Vallis—all of which may have contributed water to a lake in the Hellas basin in the distant past.Cabrol, N. and E. Grim (eds). 2010. Lakes on Mars Many places in the Hellas quadrangle show signs of ice in the ground, especially places with glacier-like flow features. Hellas Basin The Hellas quadrangle contains part of the Hellas Basin, the largest known impact crater on the surface of Mars and the second largest in the solar system. The depth of the crater is 7152 mMartian Weather Observation MGS radio science measured 11.50 mbar at 34.4° S 59.6° E -7152 meters. (23,000 ft) below the standard topographic datum of Mars. The basin is located in the southern highlands of Mars and is thought to have been formed about 3.9 billion years ago, during the Late Heavy Bombardment. Studies suggest that when an impact created the Hellas Basin, the entire surface of Mars was heated hundreds of degrees, 70 meters of molted rock fell on the planet, and an atmosphere of gaseous rock was formed. This rock atmosphere was 10 times as thick as the Earth's atmosphere. In a few days, the rock would have condensed out and covered the whole planet with an additional 10 m of molten rock. In the Northwest portion of Hellas Planitia is a strange type of surface called complex banded terrain or taffy-pull terrain. Its process of formation is still largely unknown, although it appears to be due to erosion of hard and soft sediment along with ductile deformation. Ductile deformation results from layers undergoing strain.http://hirise.lpl.arizonai.edu/P/sP_008559_1405 Early in the planet's history, it is believed that a giant lake existed in the Hellas Basin.Voelker, M., et al. 2016. DISTRIBUTION AND EVOLUTION OF LACUSTRINE AND FLUVIAL FEATURES IN HELLAS PLANITIA, MARS, BASED ON PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF GRID-MAPPING. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 1228.pdf. Possible shorelines have been discovered. These are evident in alternating benches and scarps visible in Mars orbiting camera narrow-angle images. In addition, Mars orbiting laser altimeter (MOLA) data show that the contacts of these sedimentary units mark contours of constant elevation for thousands of km, and in one case all around the basin. Channels, believed to be formed by water, enter into the basin. The Hellas drainage basin may be almost one-fifth that of the entire northern plains. A lake in Hellas in today's Martian climate would form a thick ice at the top that would eventually sublimate away. That is the ice would turn directly from a solid to a gas. This is similar to how dry ice (solid carbon dioxide) behaves on Earth. Glacial features (terminal moraines, drumlins, and eskers) have been found that may have been formed when the water froze.

Image:Twisted Ground in Hellas.jpgTwisted Ground in Hellas, as seen by HiRISE This is one more example of how difficult it would be to walk on Mars. Lobate debris aprons One very important feature common in east Hellas are piles of material surrounding cliffs. The formation is called a lobate debris apron (LDA). Recently, research with the Shallow Radar on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has provided strong evidence that the LDAs are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of rocks.http://news.brown.edu/pressreleases/2008/04/martian-glaciers Large amounts of water ice are believed to be in the LDAs. Available evidence strongly suggests that the eastern part of Hellas accumulated snow in the past. When the tilt (obliquity) of Mars increases the southern ice cap releases large amounts of water vapor. Climate models predict that when this occurs, water vapor condenses and falls where LDAs are located. The tilt of the earth changes little because our relatively large moon keeps it stable. The two tiny Martian moons do not stabilize their planet, so the rotational axis of Mars undergoes large variations. Lobate debris aprons may be a major source of water for future Mars colonists. Their major advantage over other sources of Martian water are that they can easily mapped from orbit and they are closer to the equator, where manned missions are more likely to land.

Lineated Floor Deposits On the floors of some channels are features called lineated floor deposits or lineated valley fill. They are ridged and grooved materials that seem to deflect around obstacles. They are believed to be ice-rich. Some glaciers on the Earth show such features. Lineated floor deposits may be related to lobate debris aprons, which have been proven to contain large amounts of ice. Reull Vallis, as pictured below, displays these deposits.

Image:Layers in Monument Valley.jpgLayers in Monument Valley. These are accepted as being formed, at least in part, by water deposition. Since Mars contains similar layers, water remains as a major cause of layering on Mars. Ice-rich mantle Niger Vallis with features typical of this latitude, as seen by HiRISE. Chevron patterns result from movement of ice-rich material. Click on image to see chevron pattern and mantle Much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it displays a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. The image at the right shows a good view of this smooth mantle around Niger Vallis, as observed with HiRISE. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor condenses on the particles, then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice. 45070 1440mantlelayers.jpgSmooth mantle with layers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program 46270 1445mantle.jpgClose view of mantle, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 048063 1395crater.jpgCrater showing how thick mantle is in place, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program 48063 1395mantle.jpgClose view of the edge of mantle, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program Upper Plains Unit Remnants of a 50-100 meter thick mantling, called the upper plains unit, has been discovered in the mid-latitudes of Mars. First investigated in the Deuteronilus Mensae region, but it occurs in other places as well. The remnants consist of sets of dipping layers in craters and along mesas.Carr, M. 2001. Sets of dipping layers may be of various sizes and shapes—some look like Aztec pyramids from Central America.

Material for this unit fell from the sky as ice-coated dust. The picture was taken by HiRISE, under the HiWish program. This unit also degrades into brain terrain. Brain terrain is a region of maze-like ridges 3–5 meters high. Some ridges may consist of an ice core, so they may be sources of water for future colonists.

ESP 028336 1395pyramidhellas.jpgSmall, layered structure, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program Picture also shows brain terrain forming. Some regions of the upper plains unit display large fractures and troughs with raised rims; such regions are called ribbed upper plains. Fractures are believed to have started with small cracks from stresses. Stress is suggested to initiate the fracture process since ribbed upper plains are common when debris aprons come together or near the edge of debris aprons—such sites would generate compressional stresses. Cracks exposed more surfaces, and consequently more ice in the material sublimates into the planet's thin atmosphere. Eventually, small cracks become large canyons or troughs. Small cracks often contain small pits and chains of pits; these are thought to be from sublimation of ice in the ground.Morgenstern, A., et al. 2007Baker, D., J. Head. 2015. Extensive Middle Amazonian mantling of debris aprons and plains in Deuteronilus Mensae, Mars: Implication for the record of mid-latitude glaciation. Icarus: 260, 269-288. Large areas of the Martian surface are loaded with ice that is protected by a meters thick layer of dust and other material. However, if cracks appear, a fresh surface will expose ice to the thin atmosphere.Levy, J. et al. 2009. Concentric In a short time, the ice will disappear into the cold, thin atmosphere in a process called sublimation. Dry ice behaves in a similar fashion on the Earth. On Mars sublimation has been observed when the Phoenix lander uncovered chunks of ice that disappeared in a few days.Bright Chunks at Phoenix Lander's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice – Official NASA press release (19.06.2008)http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080619.html In addition, HiRISE has seen fresh craters with ice at the bottom. After a time, HiRISE saw the ice deposit disappear.Byrne, S. et al. 2009.

Image:Evaporating ice on Mars Phoenix lander image.jpgColor versions of the photos showing ice sublimation, with the lower left corner of the trench enlarged in the insets in the upper right of the images. The upper plains unit is thought to have fallen from the sky. It drapes various surfaces, as if it fell evenly. As is the case for other mantle deposits, the upper plains unit has layers, is fine-grained, and is ice-rich. It is widespread; it does not seem to have a point source. The surface appearance of some regions of Mars is due to how this unit has degraded. It is a major cause of the surface appearance of lobate debris aprons. The layering of the upper plains mantling unit and other mantling units are believed to be caused by major changes in the planet's climate. Models predict that the obliquity or tilt of the rotational axis has varied from its present 25 degrees to maybe over 80 degrees over geological time. Periods of high tilt will cause the ice in the polar caps to be redistributed and change the amount of dust in the atmosphere.Head, J. et al. 2003.Madeleine, et al. 2014. Climate change caused ice-rich features Many features on Mars, including ones in Hellas quadrangle, are believed to contain large amounts of ice. The most popular model for the origin of the ice is climate change from large changes in the tilt of the planet's rotational axis. At times the tilt has even been greater than 80 degrees Large changes in the tilt explains many ice- rich features on Mars. Studies have shown that when the tilt of Mars reaches 45 degrees from its current 25 degrees, ice is no longer stable at the poles. Furthermore, at this high tilt, stores of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimate, thereby increasing the atmospheric pressure. This increased pressure allows more dust to be held in the atmosphere. Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains. Calculations suggest this material will concentrate in the mid-latitudes.Hauber, E., D. Reiss, M. Ulrich, F. Preusker, F. Trauthan, M. Zanetti, H. Hiesinger, R. Jaumann, L. Johansson, A. Johnsson, S. Van Gaselt, M. Olvmo. 2011. Landscape evolution in Martian mid-latitude regions: insights from analogous periglacial landforms in Svalbard. In: Balme, M., A. Bargery, C. Gallagher, S. Guta (eds). Martian Geomorphology. Geological Society, London. Special Publications: 356. 111-131 General circulation models of the Martian atmosphere predict accumulations of ice-rich dust in the same areas where ice-rich features are found. When the tilt begins to return to lower values, the ice sublimates (turns directly to a gas) and leaves behind a lag of dust. The lag deposit caps the underlying material so with each cycle of high tilt levels, some ice- rich mantle remains behind.Madeleine, J., F. Forget, J. Head, B. Levrard, F. Montmessin. 2007. Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model. In: Seventh International Conference on Mars. Abstract 3096. Note, that the smooth surface mantle layer probably represents only relative recent material. Origin of Dao Vallis Dao Vallis, as seen by THEMIS. Click on image to see relationship of Dao Vallis to other nearby features Dao Vallis begins near a large volcano, called Hadriaca Patera, so it is thought to have received water when hot magma melted huge amounts of ice in the frozen ground. The partially circular depressions on the left side of the channel in the adjacent image suggests that groundwater sapping also contributed water.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020807a Dust devil tracks Secchi Crater Floor, as seen by HiRISE. Click on image to see dust devil tracks and a pedestal crater Many areas on Mars, including the Hellas quadrangle, experience the passage of giant dust devils. A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. Dust devils have been seen from the ground and from orbiting spacecraft. They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives.http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20070412a.html The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they have lasted more than five years. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. A study that combined data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) found that some large dust devils on Mars have a diameter of 700 meters and last at least 26 minutes.

Evidence for possible recent liquid water Penticton Crater New Light-Toned Feature, as seen by HiRISE The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter discovered changes on the wall of Penticton Crater between 1999 and 2004. One interpretation of the changes was that they were caused by water flowing on the surface. A further analysis, published about a year later, revealed that the deposit could have been caused by gravity moving material down slope (a landslide). The slope where the deposit was sighted was close to the stability limits of dry, unconsolidated materials. Other Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. ESP 047615 1275pedestal.jpgPedestal crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Image:Pedestal crater3.jpgPedestal craters form when the ejecta from impacts protect the underlying material from erosion. As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings. Image:Pedestaldrawingcolor2.jpgDrawing shows a later idea of how some pedestal craters form. In this way of thinking, an impacting projectile goes into an ice-rich layer—but no further. Heat and wind from the impact hardens the surface against erosion. This hardening can be accomplished by the melting of ice which produces a salt/mineral solution thereby cementing the surface.

Glacial Features Glaciers, loosely defined as patches of currently or recently flowing ice, are thought to be present across large but restricted areas of the modern Martian surface, and are inferred to have been more widely distributed at times in the past.\\"The Surface of Mars\\" Series: Cambridge Planetary Science (No. 6) Michael H. Carr, United States Geological Survey, Menlo Park Lobate convex features on the surface known as viscous flow features and lobate debris aprons, which show the characteristics of non- Newtonian flow, are now almost unanimously regarded as true glaciers. A climate model, reported in the journal Science in 2006, found that large amounts of ice should accumulate in the Hellas region, in the same places where glaciers are observed. Water is transported from the south polar area to northern Hellas and falls as precipitation.Forget, F., et al. 2006. Formation of Glaciers on Mars by Atmospheric Precipitation at High Obliquity.

This \\"honeycomb\\" terrain was first discovered in the northwestern part of Hellas. The geologic process responsible for creating these features remains unresolved.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_049330_1425 Some calculations indicate that this formation may have been caused by ice moving up through the ground in this region. The ice layer would have been between 100 m and 1 km thick.Weiss, D., J. Head. 2017. HYDROLOGY OF THE HELLAS BASIN AND THE EARLY MARS CLIMATE: WAS THE HONEYCOMB TERRAIN FORMED BY SALT OR ICE DIAPIRISM? Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII. 1060.pdf When one substance moves up through another denser substance, it is called a diapir. So, it seems that large masses of ice have pushed up layers of rock into domes that were eroded. After erosion removed the top of the layered domes, circular features remained. Diapirs are thought to be responsible for features on Neptune's moon Triton, Jupiter's moon Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus, and Uranus's moon Miranda.Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations, Enceladus Rev 80 Flyby: Aug 11 '08.

Gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. Moreover, they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions, others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30-44 S. For years, many believed that gullies were formed by running water, but further observations demonstrate that they may be formed by dry ice. Recent studies describe using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on MRO to examine gullies at 356 sites, starting in 2006. Thirty-eight of the sites showed active gully formation. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter, triggers avalanches.

Exposed subsurface ice sheets in the martian mid-latitudes. Science. 359. 199. The scientists found eight eroding slopes showing exposed water ice sheets as thick as 100 meters. Seven of the locations were in the southern hemisphere. Much evidence of buried ice under the ground on vast regions of Mars has already been found by past studies, but this study found that the ice was only covered by a layer of about 1 or 2 meters thick of soil.Steep Slopes on Mars Reveal Structure of Buried Ice.

One wall is very steep and faces the pole. The fact that water-ice makes up the layers was confirmed by Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The spectra gathered by CRISM showed strong signals of water. The layers are especially prominent in depressions in Hellas quadrangle as shown in the enlarged views below.

The lower layers are tilted, while layers near the surface are more or less horizontal. Such an arrangement of layers is called an \\"angular unconformity.\\" Besides being of great value to future explorers, these ice layers could help us better understand the climate history of Mars. They provide a record of the past. The large variations in the tilt of the planet cause dramatic climate variations. Mars does not possess a large moon to keep its tilt stable. Today, ice is concentrated at the poles, with a greater tilt, more ice will exist at mid-latitudes. These climate changes may be able to be measured with study of these layers. These triangular depressions are similar to those in scalloped terrain. However scalloped terrain, displays a gentle equator-facing slope and is rounded. Scalloped topography Scalloped topography is common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, between 45° and 60° north and south. It is particularly prominent in the region of Utopia Planitia, in the northern hemisphere, and in the region of Peneus and Amphitrites PateraeZanetti, M., Hiesinger,H., Reiss, D., Hauber, E. and Neukum, G. (2009), \\"Scalloped Depression Development on Malea Planum and the Southern Wall of the Hellas Basin, Mars\\", 40th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, abstract 2178 in the southern hemisphere. Such topography consists of shallow, rimless depressions with scalloped edges, commonly referred to as \\"scalloped depressions\\" or simply \\"scallops\\". Scalloped depressions can be isolated or clustered and sometimes seem to coalesce. A typical scalloped depression displays a gentle equator-facing slope and a steeper pole-facing scarp.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_038821_1235 Scalloped depressions are believed to form from the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (direct transition of a material from the solid to the gas phase with no intermediate liquid stage). This process may still be happening at present. This topography may be of great importance for future colonization of Mars because it may point to deposits of pure ice. Image:Scalop formation.jpgStages in scalop formation, as seen by HiRISE. These formations probably form from the sublimation of ground rich in pure water ice many meters in depth.Dundas, C., S.

It is believed that a void was created and material collapsed into the pits. These pits are probably most commonly formed when ice leaves the ground thereby creating a void. In the thin atmosphere of Mars, ice will sublimate, especially if a crack occurs. Sublimation is when a solid turns directly into a gas. Dry ice does this on the Earth. Some pits are associated with cracks in the surface.Mangold, N. 2010. Ice sublimation as a geomorphic process: A planetary perspective.

The Eridania quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Eridania quadrangle is also referred to as MC-29 (Mars Chart-29).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. “Geodesy and Cartography” in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The Eridania quadrangle lies between 30° and 65° south latitude and 180° and 240° west longitude on the planet Mars. Most of the classic region named Terra Cimmeria is found within this quadrangle. Part of the Electris deposits, a 100–200 meters thick, light- toned deposit covers the Eridania quadrangle.Grant, J. and P. Schultz. 1990. Gradational epochs on Mars: Evidence from west-northwest of Isidis Basin and Electric. Icarus: 84. 166-195. Many slopes in Eridania contain gullies, which are believed to be caused by flowing water. Martian Gullies The Eridania quadrangle is the location of gullies that may be due to recent flowing water. Gullies occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. Moreover, they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions,Edgett, K. et al. 2003. Polar-and middle-latitude martian gullies: A view from MGS MOC after 2 Mars years in the mapping orbit. Lunar Planet. Sci. 34. Abstract 1038. others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30-44 S.http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3138.pdf Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them,http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug03/MartianGullies.html the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer, from melting at the base of old glaciers, or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK. Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their formation and that they could be very young, scientists are excited. Maybe the gullies are where we should go to find life. There is evidence for all three theories. Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin. One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down, the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. Eventually, water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break—like a crater wall. The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_aquifer_041112.html Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa As for the next theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust.Malin, M. and K. Edgett. 2001. Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera: Interplanetary cruise through primary mission. J. Geophys. Res.: 106, 23429-23570Mustard, J. et al. 2001. Evidence for recent climate change on Mars from the identification of youthful near-surface ground ice. Nature 412. 411-414. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smooths the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies.NBC News Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080319-mars- gullies_2.html Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods, water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulating the remaining ice.MLA NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2003, December 18). Mars May Be Emerging From An Ice Age. ScienceDaily. Retrieved February 19, 2009, from http://www.sciencedaily.com /releases/2003/12/031218075443.htmAds by GoogleAdvertise Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow. Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. The third theory might be possible since climate changes may be enough to simply allow ice in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies. During a warmer climate, the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a \\"debris flow\\" similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast.Peulvast, J. Physio-Geo. 18. 87-105. Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow. Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough.Costard, F. et al. 2001. Debris Flows on Mars: Analogy with Terrestrial Periglacial Environment and Climatic Implications.

Dust devil tracks  Many areas on Mars, including Eridania, experience the passage of giant dust devils. A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. Dust devils occur when the sun warms up the air near a flat, dry surface. The warm air then rises quickly through the cooler air and begins spinning while moving ahead. This spinning, moving cell may pick up dust and sand then leave behind a clean surface.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_00481_2410 Dust devils have been seen from the ground and high overhead from orbit. They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives.http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20070412a.html The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they lasted more than six years, and one is still going after 8 years. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. A study that combined data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) found that some large dust devils on Mars have a diameter of 700 meters and last at least 26 minutes.

Location is 55.11 S and 196.63 W.  Paleomagnetism  The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) discovered magnetic stripes in the crust of Mars, especially in the Phaethontis and Eridania quadrangles (Terra Cimmeria and Terra Sirenum).Barlow, N. 2008. Mars: An Introduction to its Interior, Surface and Atmosphere. Cambridge University Press The magnetometer on MGS discovered 100 km wide stripes of magnetized crust running roughly parallel for up to 2000 km. These stripes alternate in polarity with the north magnetic pole of one pointing up from the surface and the north magnetic pole of the next pointing down. When similar stripes were discovered on Earth in the 1960s, they were taken as evidence of plate tectonics. Researchers believe these magnetic stripes on Mars are evidence for a short, early period of plate tectonic activity.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars-plate-tectonics- recent-past-110103.html When the rocks became solid they retained the magnetism that existed at the time. A magnetic field of a planet is believed to be caused by fluid motions under the surface.Connerney, J. et al. 1999. Magnetic lineations in the ancient crust of Mars. Science: 284. 794-798.Langlais, B. et al. 2004. Crustal magnetic field of Mars Journal of Geophysical Research 109: EO2008 However, there are some differences, between the magnetic stripes on Earth and those on Mars. The Martian stripes are wider, much more strongly magnetized, and do not appear to spread out from a middle crustal spreading zone. Because the area containing the magnetic stripes is about 4 billion years old, it is believed that the global magnetic field probably lasted for only the first few hundred million years of Mars' life, when the temperature of the molten iron in the planet's core might have been high enough to mix it into a magnetic dynamo. There are no magnetic fields near large impact basins like Hellas. The shock of the impact may have erased the remnant magnetization in the rock. So, magnetism produced by early fluid motion in the core would not have existed after the impacts. Some researchers have proposed that early in its history Mars exhibited a form of plate tectonics. At about 3.93 billion years ago Mars became a one plate planet with a superplume under Tharsis.Baker, V., et al. 2017. THE WATERY ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF MARS: A GEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIII (2002). 1586pdf. When molten rock containing magnetic material, such as hematite (Fe2O3), cools and solidifies in the presence of a magnetic field, it becomes magnetized and takes on the polarity of the background field. This magnetism is lost only if the rock is subsequently heated above a particular temperature (the Curie point which is 770 °C for iron). The magnetism left in rocks is a record of the magnetic field when the rock solidified.http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31028&fbodylongid;=645 Dunes Dunes, including barchans are present in the Eridania quadrangle and some pictures below. When there are perfect conditions for producing sand dunes, steady wind in one direction and just enough sand, a barchan sand dune forms. Barchans have a gentle slope on the wind side and a much steeper slope on the lee side where horns or a notch often forms. The whole dune may appear to move with the wind. Observing dunes on Mars can tell us how strong the winds are, as well as their direction. If pictures are taken at regular intervals, one may see changes in the dunes or possibly in ripples on the dune’s surface. On Mars dunes are often dark in color because they were formed from the common, volcanic rock basalt. In the dry environment, dark minerals in basalt, like olivine and pyroxene, do not break down as they do on Earth. Although rare, some dark sand is found on Hawaii which also has many volcanoes discharging basalt. Barchan is a Russian term because this type of dune was first seen in the desert regions of Turkistan.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/53068/barchan Some of the wind on Mars is created when the dry ice at the poles is heated in the spring. At that time, the solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimates or changes directly to a gas and rushes away at high speeds. Each Martian year 30% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere freezes out and covers the pole that is experiencing winter, so there is a great potential for strong winds.

ESP 052111 1405tongue.jpgFlow, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program Lake The Eridania Basin, located near 180 E and 30 South, is thought to have contained a large lake with a depth of 1 km in places. The basin is composed of a group of eroded and connected topographically impact basins. The lake has been estimated to have an area of 3,000,000 square kilometers. Water from this lake entered Ma'adim Vallis which starts at the lake's north boundary.Michalski, J., E. Noe Dobrea1, C. Weitz. 2015. Mg-rich clays and silica-bearing deposits in Eridania basin: Possible evidence for ancient sea deposits in Mars. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 2754.pdf It is surrounded by valley networks that all end at the same elevation, suggesting that they emptied into a lake.Baker, D., J. Head. 2014. 44th LPSC, abstract #1252 Magnessium-rich clay minerals and opaline silica have been detected in the area. These minerals are consistent with the presence of a large lake.

PIA22059 fig1eridaniadepthslabeled.jpgFeatures around Eridania Sea labeled The region of this lake shows strong evidence for ancient magnetism on Mars. It has been suggested that the crust was pulled apart here, as on plate boundaries on the Earth. There are high levels of potassium in the area which may point to a deep mantle source for volcanism or major changes in the crust.Staudigel, H. 2013. Treatise on Geochemistry 2nd edn, Vol. 4 (eds Holland, H. & Turekian, K.), 583–606. Later research with CRISM found thick deposits, greater than 400 meters thick, that contained the minerals saponite, talc-saponite, Fe-rich mica (for example, glauconite-nontronite), Fe- and Mg- serpentine, Mg-Fe-Ca-carbonate and probable Fe-sulphide. The Fe-sulphide probably formed in deep water from water heated by volcanoes. Analyses from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter provided evidence of ancient hydrothermal seafloor deposits in Eridania basin, suggesting that hydrothermal vents pumped mineral-laden water directly into this ancient Martian lake.Mars Study Yields Clues to Possible Cradle of Life. NASA News, 6 October 2017. PIA22058 hireseridanaregion.jpgDeep-basin deposits from the floor of Eridania Sea.

Latitude dependent mantle Much of the Martian surface is covered with a thick ice-rich, mantle layer that has fallen from the sky a number of times in the past. In some places a number of layers are visible in the mantle.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_048897_2125 Some surfaces in Eridania are covered with this ice-rich mantling unit.

Another sign of water is the presence of gullies carved into steep slopes. Martian Gullies Gullies are common in some parts of Mars. Gullies occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Martian gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. Moreover, they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions,Edgett, K. et al. 2003. Polar-and middle-latitude martian gullies: A view from MGS MOC after 2 Mars years in the mapping orbit. Lunar Planet. Sci. 34. Abstract 1038. others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30-44 S.http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3138.pdfDickson, J. et al. 2007. Martian gullies in the southern mid-latitudes of Mars Evidence for climate-controlled formation of young fluvial features based upon local and global topography. Icarus: 188. 315-323 Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them,http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug03/MartianGullies.html the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer, from melting at the base of old glaciers, or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer.Heldmann, J. and M. Mellon. Observations of martian gullies and constraints on potential formation mechanisms. 2004. Icarus. 168: 285-304.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK. There is evidence for all three theories. Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin.Heldmann, J. and M. Mellon. 2004. Observations of martian gullies and constraints on potential formation mechanisms. Icarus. 168:285-304 One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down, the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. Eventually, water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break—like a crater wall. The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_aquifer_041112.html Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa As for the next theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust.Malin, M. and K. Edgett. 2001. Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera: Interplanetary cruise through primary mission. J. Geophys. Res.: 106> 23429-23570Carr, M. 2001. Mars Global Surveyor observations of fretted terrain. J. Geophys. Res.: 106. 23571-23595. This ice- rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies.NBC News Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080319-mars- gullies_2.html Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulating the remaining ice. Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow. Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. Very few gullies are found in the Thaumasia region; however, a few are present in the lower elevations like the one pictured below in Ross Crater. Image:Context for Gullies in Ross crater.jpgCTX image of part of Ross Crater showing context for next image from HiRISE. Image:Gullies in Ross Crater.JPGGullies in Ross Crater, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program. Because the gullies are on the narrow rim of a crater and they start at different heights, this example is not consistent with the model of gullies being caused by aquifers.

Water probably flowed in these gullies more than once. ESP 048546 1225gullies.jpgGullies, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program The third theory might be possible since climate changes may be enough to simply allow ice in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies. During a warmer climate, the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a \\"debris flow\\" similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast.Peulvast, J. Physio-Geo. 18. 87-105. Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow. Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough.Costard, F. et al. 2001. Debris Flows on Mars: Analogy with Terrestrial Periglacial Environment and Climatic Implications. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXII (2001). 1534.pdfhttp://www.spaceref.com:16090/news/viewpr.html?pid=7124, Calculations show that a third of a mm of runoff can be produced each day for 50 days of each Martian year, even under current conditions.Clow, G. 1987.

High resolution photos show that the dark markings are dark sand dunes. Dark sand dunes probably contain the igneous rock basalt. Brashear Crater, pictured below, is one crater with dark dunes.

Warrego Valles Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter images, showed a network of branching valleys in Thaumasia called Warrego Valles. These networks are evidence that Mars may have once been warmer, wetter, and perhaps had precipitation in the form of rain or snow. A study with the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) support the idea that Warrego Valles was formed from precipitation.Ansan, V and N. Mangold. 2006. New observations of Warrego Valles, Mars: Evidence for precipitation and surface runoff. Icarus. 54:219-242. At first glance they resemble river valleys on our Earth. But sharper images from more advanced cameras reveal that the valleys are not continuous. They are very old and may have suffered from the effects of erosion. A picture below shows some of these branching valleys.http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/10/03/ Image:Channels near Warrego in Thaumasia.JPGChannels near Warrego Valles, as seen by THEMIS. These branched channels are strong evidence for flowing water on Mars, perhaps during a much warmer period. Craters The density of impact craters is used to determine the surface ages of Mars and other solar system bodies.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The older the surface, the more craters present. Crater shapes can reveal the presence of ground ice. The area around craters may be rich in minerals. On Mars, heat from the impact melts ice in the ground. Water from the melting ice dissolves minerals, and then deposits them in cracks or faults that were produced with the impact. This process, called hydrothermal alteration, is a major way in which ore deposits are produced. The area around Martian craters may be rich in useful ores for the future colonization of Mars.http://www.indiana.edu/~sierra/papers/2003/Patterson.html. Studies on the earth have documented that cracks are produced and that secondary minerals veins are deposited in the cracks.Osinski, G, J. Spray, and P. Lee. 2001.

Deltas form when sediment is washed in from a stream entering a quiet body of water. It takes a bit of time to form a delta, so the presence of a delta is exciting; it means water was there for a time, maybe for many years. Primitive organisms may have developed in such lakes; hence, some craters may be prime targets for the search for evidence of life on the Red Planet.Newsom H., Hagerty J., Thorsos I. 2001.

The west-central part contains the Argyre basin, defined by a rim of rugged mountain blocks that surrounds a nearly circular expanse of light-colored plains. The large basin is surrounded by heavily cratered highlands. The Argyre quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Argyre quadrangle is also referred to as MC-26 (Mars Chart-26).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

Name The word Argyre is named after a legendary silver at the mouth of the Ganges--[Arakan, Berma.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. The Argyre quadrangle covers the area from 0° to 60° west longitude and from 30° to 65° south latitude on Mars. It contains Galle crater, which resembles a smiley face and the Argyre basin, a giant impact crater. Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Hale Crater that are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta. Many steep slopes in this quadrangle contain gullies, which are believed to have formed by relatively recent flows of water. Martian gullies Gullies are common in some latitude bands on Mars. Usually, martian gullies are found on the walls of craters or troughs, but Charitum Montes, a group of mountains, has gullies in some areas (See the image below). Gullies occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. Moreover, they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions,Edgett, K. et al. 2003. Polar-and middle-latitude martian gullies: A view from MGS MOC after 2 Mars years in the mapping orbit. Lunar Planet. Sci. 34. Abstract 1038. others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30-44 S.http://www.planetary.brown.edu/pdfs/3138.pdf Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them, the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer, from melting at the base of old glaciers, or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK. Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their formation and that they could be very young, scientists are excited. Maybe the gullies are where we should go to find life. There is evidence for all three theories. Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin. One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down, the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. Eventually, water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break—like a crater wall. The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies. Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa As for the next theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulating the remaining ice.MLA NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2003, December 18). Mars May Be Emerging From An Ice Age. ScienceDaily. Retrieved February 19, 2009, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031218075443.htmAds by GoogleAdvertise Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow. Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. The third theory might be possible since climate changes may be enough to simply allow ice in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies. During a warmer climate, the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a \\"debris flow\\" similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast.Peulvast, J. Physio-Geo. 18. 87-105. Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow. Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough.Costard, F. et al. 2001. Debris Flows on Mars: Analogy with Terrestrial Periglacial Environment and Climatic Implications.

It is believed to have contained a lake early in the history of Mars.Parker, T. et al. 2000. Argyre Planitia and the Mars global hydrolocia cycle. LPSC XXXI. Abstract 2033 At least three river valleys (Surius Vallis, Dzigal Vallis, and Palacopus Vallis) drain into it from the south. After it froze solid, the ice formed eskers which are visible today.Kargel, J. and R. Strom. 1991. Terrestrial glacial eskers: analogs for martian sinuous ridges. LPSC XXII, 683-684. An article written by 22 researchers in Icarus concluded that the impact that formed the Argyre basin probably stuck an ice cap or a thick permafrost layer. Energy from the impact melted the ice and formed a giant lake that eventually sent water to the North. The lakes's volume was equal to that of Earth's Mediterranean Sea. The deepest part of the lake may have taken more than a hundred thousand years to freeze, but with the help of heat from the impact, geothermal heating, and dissolved solutes it may have had liquid water for many millions of years. Life may have developed in this time. This region shows a great deal of evidence of glacial activity with flow features, crevasse-like fractures, drumlins, eskers, tarns, aretes, cirques, horns, U-shaped valleys, and terraces. Because of the shapes of Argyre sinuous ridges, the authors concluded that they are eskers. Studies with advanced cameras, such as CTX, and MRO High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) suggests that these ridges are probably eskers.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Often, craters with diameters greater than 100 km have rings on their floors. Since so much material is blasted away, the ground readjusts, making circular faults. When lava flows upward along the faults, rings are produced.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing.

The hardened layers are consequently more protected from erosion. This process may occur instead of layers forming under lakes. Some locations on the Red Planet show groups of layered rocks. In some places the layers are arranged into regular patterns.Lewis, K. W., O. Aharonson, J. P. Grotzinger, A. S. McEwen, and R. L. Kirk (2010), Global significance of cyclic sedimentary deposits on Mars, Lunar Planet. Sci., XLI, Abstract 2648. It has been suggested that the layers were put into place by volcanoes, the wind, or by being at the bottom of a lake or sea. Calculations and simulations show that groundwater carrying dissolved minerals would surface in the same locations that have abundant rock layers. According to these ideas, deep canyons and large craters would receive water coming from the ground. Many craters in the Arabia area of Mars contain groups of layers. Some of these layers may have resulted from climate change. The tilt of the rotational axis of Mars has repeatedly changed in the past. Some changes are large. Because of these variations of climate, at times the atmosphere of Mars would have been much thicker and contained more moisture. The amount of atmospheric dust also has increased and decreased. It is believed that these frequent changes helped to deposit material in craters and other low places. The rising of mineral- rich ground water cemented these materials. The model also predicts that after a crater is full of layered rocks, additional layers will be laid down in the area around the crater. So, the model predicts that layers may also have formed in intercrater regions; layers in these regions have been observed. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. On Earth, mineral-rich waters often evaporate forming large deposits of various types of salts and other minerals. Sometimes water flows through Earth's aquifers, and then evaporates at the surface just as is hypothesized for Mars. One location this occurs on Earth is the Great Artesian Basin of Australia. On Earth the hardness of many sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, is largely due to the cement that was put in place as water passed through. , ESP 042597 1320layers.jpgLayers exposed in Nereidum Montes, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program The light-toned layers may contain sulfates which are good for preserving traces of ancient life. 42597 1320layers2.jpgClose-up of layers from previous image, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 043413 1495layers.jpgLow, layered mesa, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Arrows point to some layers.

Press, Austin, TX Indeed, a study published in June 2017, calculated that the volume of water needed to carve all the channels on Mars was even larger than the proposed ocean that the planet may have had. Water was probably recycled many times from the ocean to rainfall around Mars.http://spaceref.com/mars/how- much-water-was-needed-to-carve-valleys-on-mars.html Many places on Mars show channels of different sizes. Many of these channels probably carried water, at least for a time. The climate of Mars may have been such in the past that water ran on its surface. It has been known for some time that Mars undergoes many large changes in its tilt or obliquity because its two small moons lack the gravity to stabilize it, as our moon stabilizes Earth; at times the tilt of Mars has even been greater than 80 degrees ESP 047265 1415channel.jpgChannel, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 048043 1460channel.jpgChannel, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Image:Surface features in Argyre.jpgChannels in Argyre quadrangle as seen by HiRISE, under the HiWish program.

The central part is mainly a permanent residual ice cap surrounded by layered and troughed terrain which is, in turn, encircled by heavily cratered terrain. The Mare Australe quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Mare Australe quadrangle is also referred to as MC-30 (Mars Chart-30). The quadrangle covers all the area of Mars south of 65°, including the South polar ice cap, and its surrounding area. The quadrangle's name derives from an older name for a feature that is now called Planum Australe, a large plain surrounding the polar cap.Patrick Moore and Robin Rees, ed. Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 130. The Mars polar lander crash landed in this region.http://mars.nasa.gov/msp98/lander/http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=105 Notable features Around the southern ice cap is a surface, called the Dorsa Argentea Formation that may be an old ice-rich deposit. It contains a group of sinuous, branched ridges that resembles eskers that form when streams are under glaciers. The formation often contains pits: two major locations are named Cavi Angusti and Cavi Sisyphi. The pits have steep sides and an irregular shape. They are up to 50 km across and 1 km deep. The quadrangle also contains Angustus Labyrinthus, a formation of intersecting valley or ridges, nicknamed the \\"Inca City\\".Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. Researchers were surprised to see parts of the surface having a Swiss-cheese appearance. Also, some areas showed strange spider-shaped forms, which were determined to be caused by carbon dioxide gas blowing dust around at certain times of the year. Some craters in Mare Australe show gullies. Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330–2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. As soon as gullies were discovered, researchers began to image many gullies over and over, looking for possible changes. By 2006, some changes were found.Malin, M., K. Edgett, L. Posiolova, S. McColley, E. Dobrea. 2006. Present-day impact cratering rate and contemporary gully activity on Mars. Science 314, 1573_1577. Later, with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water.Kolb, et al. 2010. Investigating gully flow emplacement mechanisms using apex slopes. Icarus 2008, 132-142.McEwen, A. et al. 2007. A closer look at water-related geological activity on Mars. Science 317, 1706-1708.Pelletier, J., et al. 2008. Recent bright gully deposits on Mars wet or dry flow? Geology 36, 211-214. With continued observations many more changes were found in Gasa Crater and others.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"NASA orbiter finds new gully channel on Mars.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 22 March 2014. www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140322094409.htm With more repeated observations, more and more changes have been found; since the changes occur in the winter and spring, experts are tending to believe that gullies were formed from dry ice. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon-dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter. Freezing of atmosphere Research based on slight changes in the orbits of spacecraft around Mars over 16 years found that when one hemisphere experiences winter, approximately 3 trillion to 4 trillion tons of carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere onto the northern and southern polar caps. This represents 12 to 16 percent of the mass of the entire Martian atmosphere. These observation support predictions from the Mars Global Reference Atmospheric Model—2010.NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. \\"New gravity map gives best view yet inside Mars.\\" ScienceDaily.

The measurements were gathered with the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) on board the European Space Agency's orbiting Mars Express spacecraft. Radar reflections showed a bright spot in the ice layers that analysis later showed that it had to be a lake of liquid water. It is believed that the water remains liquid, even at the temperature of -68 degrees Celsius because there is likely much dissolved salt that lowers the freezing point. The lake is about 20 kilometers across and at least 10 centimeters deep It could contain 10 billion liters of liquid water.https://www.sciencenews.org/article/mars-may-have-lake-liquid- water-search-life R. Orosei et al. Radar evidence of subglacial liquid water on Mars. Science. Published online July 25, 2018. doi:10.1126/science.aar7268. There could very well be many small bodies of water under the ice cap; however, they are difficult to detect with MARSIS. Also, the raw date coverage needed for these detections is limited—only a few percent of the area has a full set of data. Spiders During the winter, much frost accumulates. It freezes out directly onto the surface of the permanent polar cap, which is made of water ice covered with layers of dust and sand. The deposit begins as a layer of dusty frost. Over the winter, it recrystallizes and becomes denser. The dust and sand particles caught in the frost slowly sink. By the time temperatures rise in the spring, the frost layer has become a slab of semi- transparent ice about 3 feet thick, lying on a substrate of dark sand and dust. This dark material absorbs light and causes the ice to sublimate (turn directly into a gas) below the surface. Eventually much gas accumulates and becomes pressurized. When it finds a weak spot, the gas escapes and blows out the dust.http://spaceref.com/mars/how-gas-carves-channels-on-mars.html Speeds can reach 100 miles per hour.http://themis.asu.edu/news/gas-jets-spawn-dark- spiders-and-spots-mars-icecap Dark channels can sometimes be seen; they are called \\"spiders.\\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/2016/possible- development-stages-of-martian-spidershttp://spaceref.com/mars/growth-of-a- martian-trough-network.htmlBenson, M. 2012.

During the winter season, a slab of dry ice forms on the ground surface. The surface contains cracks in the shape of polygons.

As the gas moves around the channels become larger. 48845 1010spiderspolygons.jpgClose view of spider formations, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Polygon-shaped channels are also visible. Defrosting As the temperature warms and more sunlight becomes available in the spring, frost starts to disappear. This process begins with the appearance of dark spots. By the time the temperature rises to the melting point of water ice, all ice is gone. The process was first followed with repeated images by the Mars Global Surveyor.https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/dune_defrost_6_2001/SPRING DEFROSTING OF MARTIAN POLAR REGIONS: MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR MOC AND TES MONITORING OF THE RICHARDSON CRATER DUNE FIELD, 1999–2000.

Picture taken with HiRISE under HiWish program Dust devil tracks Many areas on Mars, including Eridania, experience the passage of giant dust devils. A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. Dust devils occur when the sun warms up the air near a flat, dry surface. The warm air then rises quickly through the cooler air and begins spinning while moving ahead. This spinning, moving cell may pick up dust and sand then leave behind a clean surface.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_00481_2410 Dust devils have been seen from the ground and high overhead from orbit. They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives.http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20070412a.html The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they lasted more than six years, and one is still going after 8 years. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. A study that combined data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) found that some large dust devils on Mars have a diameter of 700 meters and last at least 26 minutes.Reiss, D. et al. 2011.

This group of ridges extends from 270–100 E and 70–90 S, around the south pole of Mars. It sits under the Late Amazonian South Polar Layered Deposits (SPLD). The amount of these ridges is huge, one study studied seven different ridge systems which contained almost 4,000 ridges that had a total length 51,000 km.Kress, A., J. Head. 2015.

Planetary and Space Science: 109-110, 1-20 Most eskers are thought to be formed inside ice-walled tunnels by streams which flowed within and under glaciers. After the retaining ice walls melted away, stream deposits remained as long winding ridges. MARSIS radar data suggest that significant areas of layered, potentially ice-rich parts of the Dorsa Argentea Formation remain today.Plaut, J., Ivanov, A., Safaeinili, A., Milkovich, S., Picardi, G., Seu, R., Phillips, R. 2007a.

A team of researchers used an early Mars global climate model together with the University of Maine Ice Sheet Model to determine how the eskers formed. They concluded that to get enough a high enough temperature in the Martian atmosphere to form the ice sheet, a greenhouse gas in addition to a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere was needed to warm the surface near the poles by at least 20 degrees C. Also, to produce the shape of the ice sheet, at least part of the Tharsis volcanoes needed to be present.Scanlon, K., et al. 2018. The Dorsa Argentea Formation and the Noachian-Hesperian climate transition. Icarus: 299, 339-363. Proof for ocean Strong evidence for a one time ancient ocean was found from data gathered from the north and south poles. In March 2015, a team of scientists published results showing that this region was highly enriched with deuterium, heavy hydrogen, by seven times as much as the Earth. This means that Mars has lost a volume of water 6.5 times what is stored in today's polar caps. The water for a time would have formed an ocean in the low-lying Mare Boreum. The amount of water could have covered the planet about 140 meters, but was probably in an ocean that in places would be almost 1 mile deep. This international team used ESO’s Very Large Telescope, along with instruments at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, to map out different forms of water in Mars’s atmosphere over a six-year period.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150305140447.htm.

The human body holds a great complexity thus it can be beneficial to use computers to solve problems involving the human body and the environment that surrounds it.  Overview  Computer-aided ergonomics is an interdisciplinary field of work that involves the use of a computer to solve complex problems regarding a human body interacting with an environment. As the title reveals, having a computer to help find the best ergonomic solution in a given situation. Ergonomics traditionally involves many disciplines including biomechanics, anthropometry, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, kinesiology, health sciences and physiology. Due to the highly interdisciplinary and complex nature of ergonomics it is hard to get a full understanding of a situation. As the human body is a complex system, thus it is beneficial to have a computer system that models the human body as a mechanical system. The human body contains several parts that can be modeled as known mechanical systems, for example bones connected with joints and driven by actuators (muscles).  Example of a system  Example of a skeletal mannequin One example of a computer system that can be used as a computer- aided ergonomics system is The AnyBody Modeling System that consider the human body as a dynamic multi-rigid-body system. The human model is a public domain model contains most of the bones, muscles and joints that are present in the human body. The model has more than 1000 muscle elements, and many muscle elements have been modeled with detailed muscle model theory described by Hill, A.V. in 1938. The muscle model contains information including physiological cross-sectional area, length, ratio of red and white fibers. The AnyBody modeling system is capable of modeling almost any human voluntary movement or static situation. One example of a model, could be a seated model, where the human body is placed in a chair, that have a seat, backrest, headrest, leg rest, footrest, and armrest. The model can then calculate the forces acting between the human body and the chair, as well as for example the forces between any given spinal vertebra. This could be used for finding the optimal seated posture for a person, who suffers from lower back pain, assuming that greater load on a vertebra result in greater pain.  Benefits of computer-aided ergonomics  The question is “In what scenario” it would be beneficial to use computer-aided ergonomics compared to traditional ergonomics. First of all computer aided ergonomics using for example a musculo-skeletal modeling system as The AnyBody Modeling system, would be beneficial in physical ergonomics, which traditional combines aspects from the human anatomical, anthropometric, physiological and biomechanical characteristics related to some physical activity. The model can provide a quantitative foundation for ergonomic design and recommendations. Traditionally “Ergonomics” has been based on recommendations derived from empirical data from various working tasks; if many people get injured from working in a certain posture, it is recommended to avoid working in that posture. However, when applying the recommendations to another related working posture, the posture or the movement often does not match exactly. This means that the theory and recommendations does not apply to the new situation. In this case it could be beneficial to model the situation in order to find out how the reaction forces and muscle activities differ from the first situation, where the recommendations were based on empirical data. A combination of risk factors can be derived from the model output. For example, when designing an office chair, one would like to design it to fulfill several demands; comfortable, relaxing, supporting and so on. Some of the criteria related to the demands might be conflicting for example; comfort is often related to the shear force on the seat, which should be kept as low as possible. The seat shear force could be removed by making a horizontal seat and rising the backrest to 90 degrees however this would not be relaxing. Therefore, a combination of seat and backrest angles needs to be considered in order to find optimal seated postures related to only the two design variables. Computer-aided ergonomics is an interdisciplinary field of work, that involve the use of a computer to solve complex problems that involve a person interacting with an environment. As the title reveals, it is all about having a computer to help finding the best ergonomic solution. Ergonomics involves many disciplines, such as biomechanics, anthropometry, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, kinesiology, health sciences and physiology. Due to the highly interdisciplinary it is hard to get a full understanding of a situation based on knowledge, unless the knowledge in some way is built into a computer system.

The line forms part of the Perth–Adelaide and Adelaide–Darwin rail route, and the portion south of Crystal Brook forms part of the Adelaide–Sydney rail route. Genesee & Wyoming Australia, Great Southern Rail, Pacific National and SCT Logistics operate services via the line. SCT Logistics' Penfield intermodal terminal is connected to a siding south of the Northern Expressway and the Bolivar crossing loop. History The government-owned South Australian Railways started to build the broad-gauge Salisbury–Long Plains line as a branch off the Main North line in 1915, completing it in April 1917. The line was extended from Long Plains to Redhill from 1917 to 1925, and again from Redhill to Port Pirie in 1937. In the latter year, the Commonwealth Railways extended its standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway line from Port Augusta south to Port Pirie.Rail Standardisation National Railway Museum In 1980, the Federal and State Governments entered an agreement to convert the line from Adelaide to standard gauge, albeit altered to meet the Trans-Australian Railway at Crystal Brook.Rail Agreement (Adelaide to Crystal Brook Railway) Act 1980 Government of Australia This allowed Adelaide to become the last mainland state capital to join the standard gauge network. The line opened in 1982. It runs on the western side of the same corridor as the Gawler railway line from north of Salisbury railway station to the triangle near Adelaide Gaol, and continues on the western side of the metropolitan broad gauge tracks to Adelaide Parklands Terminal. The new line allowed Australian National to operate The Ghan, Indian Pacific and Trans-Australian through to Adelaide without passengers having to change trains. In July 1998, it became part of the Australian Rail Track Corporation network. Until late 2017, this meant that the standard gauge trains had to cross the Outer Harbor railway line at- grade at Torrens Junction, north of the River Torrens. In 2017, this conflict was removed by lowering the suburban Outer Harbor line into a trench so it could pass under the standard gauge line. This would ease timetable and operational conflicts on both services. Crossing loops The maximum length of trains on this line is 1.8 kilometres, and almost all crossing loops are of this length. East of Mile End the maximum train length is 1.5 kilometres, though this is starting to be increased to 1.8 kilometres also. Mile End The crossing loop at the Adelaide Parklands Terminal at Mile End is of length 1,658m. Dry Creek The first crossing loop north of Adelaide, of length 1,950m, is south of Dry Creek. Bolivar The Bolivar crossing loop is 1800 metres long, having been lengthened from 1200 metres in 2012, after the Taylors Road level crossing at the southern end was replaced by an overpass of the Northern Expressway. As a result, the overpass marks the approximate mid- point of the loop.  Penfield intermodal hub  In 2007, it was proposed that an Intermodal Rail/Road facility be built in the Edinburgh Parks area.

Two Wells The next crossing loop, of length 1,817m, is at Two Wells - the loop is between Gawler Rd and Tenby Rd. Others There are about a dozen other crossing loops north of Two Wells - refer to the infobox to the right. Crystal Brook Crystal Brook includes the triangle junction with the main line to Broken Hill and Sydney. Then there is a 968m crossing loop and siding with provision to load grain at the silos in the town. The tracks converge to single track to cross a bridge over the Crystal Brook, then split into double track for the 20 km to Coonamia. The western track is for northbound travel and the eastern track for southbound, except that there is a balloon loop for loading grain from the AWB silos which is accessed by proceeding a short distance north on the eastern track. Coonamia Coonamia \\"station\\" – in the past a provisional stopping placeSouth Australian Railways working timetable 1964, Table 35 but since the early 2010s comprising only a nameboard – is the site of the \\"0 km\\" datum point for routes to Port Augusta, Broken Hill and Adelaide. At this point ARTC train controllers in Adelaide (who oversee operations between Broken Hill and Coonamia, and Coonamia southwards) hand over to controllers in Port Augusta (who oversee the line to Port Augusta and points west); the sign remains so that train crews can identify the change-over point. The location has a crossing loop 1638 m (1791 yds) long on the south side of the double mainline from Crystal Brook. A further 2.25 km (1.4 mi) west is a triangle junction where the double track ends and from which single tracks go west to Port Pirie Yard and north to Port Augusta. Port Germein The 1960m crossing loop at Port Germein had a 110m goods siding commissioned in 2015. The siding is operated by SCT Logistics.

The increasing use of plastics in daily life and for high tech applications points out the necessity to improve their reliability. These materials can eventually fail during their service life and it is crucial to be able, like in medicine, to diagnose the cause of the failure and to suggest solutions to solve the problem. Plastic materialsincluding nanocomposite and composite materials with polymer matrix are made of polymer mostly associated with “formulation” products allowing to adjust their basic properties to special use they are made for (fillers, pigments, additives. .. ). In case of failure, a decisive action is to perform the physicochemical analysis of the defect and eventually (in case of suspicion of oxidation products) to perform adapted artificial or natural ageings allowing the evaluation of their long term behaviour. CNEP : a research centre for evaluation of polymer failures A view of SEPAP weather testers in CNEP (French) National Centre for the Evaluation of Photoprotection (CNEP) is a subsidiary company of University Blaise Pascal created in 1986 by Professor Jacques Lemaire, former head of Laboratory of Molecular and Macromolecular Photochemistry (LPMM) - Clermont-Ferrand (France). Initially the goal was to transfer the expertise of LPMM on polymer photoageing to industrial companies facing increasing problems of degradation (yellowing – bleaching - physical properties loss … ). CNEP is today still associated with LPMM but also with many small, medium and world size companies working in various domains of polymer applications.transports, aeroronautics, energy, building, agriculture, sports & leisures, electronics/electricity, electrical appliances,medical, packaging… More of 500 failure cases are examined each year by CNEP and expertise on the last twenty years is covering more of 100.000 different polymer formulations. Progressively with the development of sophisticated analytical tools, CNEP was extending its activity to the direct physicochemical analysis of any failure in polymer material, not only derived from ageing (polymer degradation). All researches are made under contract with a confidentiality agreement. Since 10 years CNEP is certified by the French Ministries of Higher Education and Industry as National Centre for Technical Research(CRT). Its contact with the complete chain of plastic production allows CNEP to play also an interfacial role between polymer producers, transformers and constructors bringing : \\\\- collective approach of subjects of common interest ; \\\\- quality control and standardisation ; \\\\- legal and insurance expertise ; \\\\- contemporary artists / restorers / collectors. CNEP is also applying basic concepts of photochemistry to suggest an original approach of the long term prediction of plastic weathering. SEPAP units described elsewhere (weather testing of polymers and :fr:photovieillissement accéléré en SEPAP) provoke, in controlled accelerated relevant conditions, the same chemical evolutions than those which should occur at long term in weathering conditions. The SEPAP instrument was originally designed in the late seventies and built by ATLAS MTT in Germany. SEPAP units are now the base of many standard tests (see ). CNEP approach IR spectrometer specially designed for material analysis The CNEP approach is considering that most of initial polymer failures have a chemical origin which can be detected by specific analysis at the solid state. Among a large panel of analytical techniques located at CNEP or on the campus, those involving non destructive infra red and UV-Visible spectroscopy are particularly developed. In case of ageing analysis, the knowledge of chemical degradation mechanisms of most polymers allows to follow degradation at very low extent both in natural and accelerated conditions.Jacques Lemaire,\\"Predicting polymer durability\\" in Chemtech, October 1996, 42- 47.Dr. Olivier Haillant, \\"Polymer Weathering: A Mix of Empiricism and Science\\", Atlas SunSpots® Material Testing Product and Technology News, 2006, Vol. 36 Issue 76, 3-12 Additional information could also come from the direct analysis of formulation compounds.

The 18th-century transcriptions of the name indicate that they are a distorted form of the fused prepositional phrase *na Vršce 'on the small peak', whereas today's form of the name may be derived via Italian from the phrase *na Vrhe 'on the peak'. In both cases, the likely references is Vrhe Hill () immediately east of the village. History The Italian authorities built extensive military housing in Neverke in 1933 to maintain soldiers and workers engaged in producing gunpowder and filling munitions with gunpowder. During the Second World War, after the Italian capitulation in 1943, German forces took over the site. The Germans withdrew in spring 1944, and the site was used intermittently by the sapper squad of the Partisan 9th Corps, which destroyed the rail lines between Pivka and Rijeka and between Pivka and Trieste. After the war, the buildings were eventually taken over by the Kras poultry farm, which was established in 1959.

The fine grain makes it ideal for sculpture and architectural applications. History The extraction of Sivec marble can be dated back 500 BCE and earlier. Extraction flourished under the Roman period when the quarries near the ancient city of Stibera (today Prilep) produced stone for the production of Roman sculptures, as well as replicas of Greek original bronzes. These replicas went to Rome or to other parts of the empire. Sivec is a famous material that was used in south-east Europe from the 3rd century BCE until the 5th century CE, producing some of the most visually stunning creations of the ancient world. It is estimated that during these centuries, 1.2 million cubic meters of Sivec White Marble were mined from the Prilep area. Through the centuries, Sivec was used for many building and reconstruction sites throughout the world. It was used for the reconstruction of Roman emperor Diocletian's Palace in Split, Croatia. It has been also used by Edvard Ravnikar for lines at Prešeren Square in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Today The marble-bearing deposits in the area are widely known and are among the largest in the world. The whiteness of the marble, its homogenous form, and the micro- granular structure generate a high demand for Sivec marble on the international market. White Sivec, or Macedonian Bianco Sivec, is the commercial name for this fine-grained white dolomitic marble. Nowadays, Sivec has been selected to give the characteristic, exclusive white appearance in many large well-known projects including hotels, palaces, commercial buildings, etc. Company The company was established in 1946. In 2009, NBGI Private Equity and Ethemba Capital acquired 88.4% of the shares of the company from FHL Kyriakidis, the Athens-listed marble production and distribution group. The acquisition effected through Stone Works Holdings, a Dutch company co-owned by private equity funds managed by NBGI Private Equity and Ethemba Capital.

It has been tested in clinical trials as single treatment and in combinations with atorvastatin, ezetimibe and fenofibrate. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lomitapide on 21 December 2012, as an orphan drug to reduce LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). On 31 May 2013 the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion with a unanimous vote recommending a marketing authorization for lomitapide. On 31 July 2013 the European Commission approved lomitapide as an adjunct to a low- fat diet and other lipid-lowering medicinal products with or without low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis in adult patients with HoFH. Mechanism of action Lomitapide inhibits the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP or MTTP) which is necessary for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and secretion in the liver.

In 1863 he first performed in public, in Havana, with Van der Gutch as accompanist. Ignacio Cervantes also played at the same function. In 1864 he toured with his father and his brother José del Rosario in the Cuban cities of Matanzas, Cárdenas, Cienfuegos and Güines; in 1869 to Veracruz, México. He went from México to Paris, to study under Hubert Léonard and Charles Dancla, and gained entry to Conservatoire de Paris, where he won first prize in 1871. He then toured Florence, Turin and Milan, where he played at La Scala. His tours in Europe brought great critical and public enthusiasm. In 1875, he returned to the Americas, and was appointed director of the Conservatoire de Haiti. He played in Caracas (1876), in Cuba in Havana (1878) and Santiago de Cuba, then to Veracruz again and México City, where he performed Mendelssohn's Concerto for violin and orchestra.

It serves its community by conducting research to resolve industrial and community problems. History The institute was founded with the support and assistance of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), who sent a team in 1985 to assess the need for aid. Lead by Prof. Y. Naito from Tokyo Institute of Technology, the team conducted an initial assessment to the area that resulting agreement for the development of the campus. In 1987, construction of the institution began. Japan also provided training for EEPIS instructors, both before and after the opening of the school, in Indonesia and Japan. It was officially inaugurated on June 2, 1988 by the Indonesian president Suharto. Since its inception, the institution has held several names. When it opened, it was the Politeknik Elektronika & Telekomunikasi. From 1992 to 1991 it was entitled Politeknik Elektronika Surabaya, at which time it came under the umbrella of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. In 1996, it was retitled to Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya (PENS). After 24 years under the statute of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, the institution is no longer a part of ITS. The transition year was 2012. Since then, EEPIS is independently separated from ITS and started to stand on its own statute.  Education  As a technical educational institution in the field of applied science, PENS has a long-term vision to provide education platform in the field of emerging technologies by conducting research and innovation to the society. To diverse technical education, EEPIS in cooperation with many local governments in East Java established Community College as an embryo of vocational education in their district. The cooperation begins in the 2002 and the teaching took place in local vocational high school (SMK). In 2014, more than 1500 graduates are supplied by this schema. Degrees EEPIS offers two degrees, Diploma-III is a three-year degree course, while Diploma-IV is a four-year course. The Diploma-III graduates will hold associate degree and Diploma-IV graduates will be granted with bachelor of applied science (B.A.Sc). In 2016, EEPIS has signed an MoU with GMF AeroAsia to provide a specialized vocational education for the company to fulfill the necessity of skilled graduates with Aircraft Maintenance Training Standard (AMTO) certificate. The graduates will be directly contracted by GMF AeroAsia as a professional worker. In the same year, PLN, an Indonesian government-owned corporation also signed same MoU with mutual schema. The departments that the institution offers are: Diploma III: *Electronics Engineering *Telecommunications Engineering *Industrial Electrical Engineering *Informatics Engineering *Multimedia Broadcasting Diploma IV: *Electronics Engineering *Telecommunications Engineering *Industrial Electrical Engineering *Informatics Engineering *Mechatronics Engineering *Computer Engineering * Power Generation System * Game Technology Campus The EEPIS building is located on the campus of Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. It includes labs as well as classrooms, workshops, offices and student dormitories. It also includes a canteen, libraries and mosques. Mojokerto local district signed a Memorandum of Understanding with EEPIS to expand the main campus to their area in 2017. It is hoped that within this agreement, local society will be able to access higher education easier.

It has since been argued that trust is also included in or produced by \\"animal spirits\\". Use by Keynes The original passage by Keynes reads: Earlier uses  Philosophy and social science  The first use of the notion animal spirits is described by Descartes, Newton and other scientists on how the notion for the vitality of the body is used. These animal spirits are of an æthereal nature. In one of his letters about light, Newton wrote that the animated spirits very easily live in \\"the brain, nerves, and muscles, may become a convenient vessel to hold so subtil a spirit.\\" The spirit Newton is talking about here are the animated spirits that have an ethereal nature. It relates to life in the body. Later it became a concept that acquired a psychological content but was always thought of in connection with the life processes of the body. Therefore, retained a lower overall animal status.Hypothesis explaining the properties of light Thomas Birch, The History of the Royal Society, vol. 3 (London: 1757), pp. 247-305. William Safire explored origins of the phrase in his 2009 article \\"On Language: 'Animal Spirits'\\": Thomas Hobbes used the phrase \\"animal spirits\\" to refer to passive emotions and instincts, as well as natural functions like breathing. Ralph Waldo Emerson in Society and Solitude (1870) wrote of \\"animal spirits\\" as prompting people to action, in a broader sense than Keynes's: In social science, Karl Marx refers to \\"animal spirits\\" in the 1887 English translation of Capital, Volume 1. Marx speaks of the animal spirits of the workers, which he believes a capitalist can impel by encouraging social interaction and competition within her factory or depress by adopting assembly-line work whereby the worker repeats a single task.  Earlier and contemporaneous English use  \\"Animal spirits\\" was a euphemistic late-Victorian and Edwardian phrase used by English public school boys such as P. G. Wodehouse (born two years before the Etonian Keynes) who attended Dulwich College. Wodehouse and Arthur Conan Doyle were popular authors for public school boys in England before the Great War. Doyle himself used the phrase \\"animal spirits\\" in 1883, the year of Keynes's birth. Two examples of Wodehouse's use of the phrase are in the 1909 book Mike (later republished in two parts as Mike at Wrykyn and Mike and Psmith). \\"Animal spirits\\" denoted an adolescent attitude to authority that resulted in energetically and deliberately acting on advice, opinion, or exhortation to the point of stretching the letter of any regulations involved to the limit. The aim was to maximise short-term disruption of what was considered to be 'normal' behaviour. Restoring equilibrium subsequently required a firm sanction from those in authority and possibly also a re-casting of the regulation to prevent repeats of the actions undertaken. The slang term of the era for this was 'ragging'. Wodehouse uses antithesis in the latter example to make comedy out of Mr. Downing's astonishment; surely nobody could be less susceptible to \\"animal spirits\\" than the suave, debonaire Psmith? Psmith In The City (1910) was based on Wodehouse's own experiences in the 'square mile' and the theme is implicitly elaborated on in the financial environment of the New Asiatic Bank. John Coates of Cambridge University supports the popular English Edwardian public school intuition that qualities such as dynamism and leadership coexist with less constructive traits such as recklessness, heedlessness, and in-caution. Coates attributes this to fluctuations in hormonal balances; abnormally high levels of testosterone may create individual success but also collective excessive aggression, overconfidence, and herd behaviour, while too much cortisol can promote irrational pessimism and risk aversion. The author's remedy for this is to shift the employment balance in finance towards women and older men and monitor traders' biology.  Contemporary research  Recent research shows that the term 'animal spirits' was used in the works of a psychologist that Keynes had studied in 1905 and also suggests that Keynes implicitly drew upon an evolutionary understanding of human instinct.

He next contested Chelmsford in Essex at the 1922 general election coming second to the Conservative Member of Parliament for the constituency since 1908, E. G. Pretyman, with Labour in third.

In Ohio, it is an expressway and freeway for much of its length, from the Indiana state line to Maumee. From there northeasterly to the Michigan state line at Toledo, it is a surface highway. Route description left From the Indiana state line easterly to Baltimore Street at the border of unincorporated Defiance Township and the city of Defiance, US 24 is an expressway which mostly has interchanges, but features intersections with select county and township roads. From Baltimore Street to State Route 281 at the border of Defiance and unincorporated Noble Township, US 24 is a freeway. From SR 281 to US 6 west in Henry County's Napoleon Township, US 24 is once again an expressway. From US 6 west to Interstate 475 (I-475) in the city of Maumee, US 24 is a freeway. The route continues northeasterly as a surface street through downtown Maumee and the western side of Toledo, continuing to the Michigan state line. At this point, the route continues northerly into Michigan as a north–south highway. History Upgrades to the route around Napoleon began in 2008. This included the construction of a new route from east of Napoleon to north of Waterville, bypassing the original routing of the highway. This rerouting was done to \\"alleviate safety concerns caused by the mixture of truck traffic and residential travel\\" along US 24's former routing. New alignments west of Defiance through to Interstate 469 in Fort Wayne, Indiana were also built in the late 2000s. The conversion to an expressway, first proposed in 1969, was made due to the high number of road accidents along the old alignment, which comprised only two lanes and was frequently used by tractor-trailers.

History In the near vicinity of Lake Leśno Dolne is an archaeological site called Kamienne Kręgi (English: \\"Stone Circles\\") which contains numerous barrows and cists. Some are dated back as far as the Bronze Age. Other, later, barrows are dated back to the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and are connected with Gothic settlement.Leśno Barrow Cemetery The village of Leśno first appears in the records for the year 1342, in which Winrich von Kniprode, master of the Teutonic Knights, granted it to one \\"Dytryk\\" for services to be rendered.Slownik Geograficzny Krolestwa Polskiego (Warsaw 1884) In the time of the Partitions, Leśno, like all of the surrounding region, became part of the Prussian Empire. From 1919 to 1939, during the Second Polish Republic, it was included as a part of Poland. After the German conquest of 1939 it was part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. During the German occupation, the resistance organization Gryf Pomorski (English: \\"Pomeranian Griffin\\") maintained a radio station named \\"Budnik\\" (\\"Alarm Clock\\") in the nearby hamlet of Widno.A. Gasiorowski and K. Steyer, Tajna Organizacja Wojskowa Gryf Pomorski (Gdansk 2010), p. 131. Kashubian Emigration to America Leśno has long been considered a part of the Kashubian culture. During the Kashubian diaspora, many families from Leśno such as the Bambenek (Bambeneks) and the Stoltmann (Sztoltmans), Spierewka (Sprouffske), Bielawa emigrated to the area of Winona, Minnesota in the United States, beginning in the late 1850s.

Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross Lesno-kosciol1The Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in Leśno dates back as far as 1643 and has the highest wooden tower in Poland. First mentioned in 1534 as the church of Saint Katarzyna, the historical work Ad Historiam Ecclesiasticam Pomeraniae states that it was refounded and given its present name by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga of Poland circa 1642.Miasto Brusy official website Miraculously, the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross escaped major damage during the First and Second World Wars. Indeed, many of the antique fittings have been preserved and can be viewed today.

Chuckie Taylor, Charles Taylor's son, served as commander of the force for a period. The ATU was initially organized ostensibly to protect government buildings, the executive mansion, the international airport, and to provide security for some foreign embassies. It was a special forces group consisting predominantly of foreign nationals from Burkina Faso and The Gambia, as well as former Revolutionary United Front (RUF) combatants from Sierra Leone. The ATU had no legal basis for its existence, and was not under the command of the Ministry of Defense. The ATU absorbed Taylor's most experienced NPFL civil war fighters, including undisciplined and untrained loyalists. Sam Bockarie (alias Mosquito), and Brig. Gen. Abu were named as being among the ATU's senior personnel in a report issued in October 2001. According to a report from the UN Panel of Experts on Diamonds and Arms in Sierra Leone, issued in December 2000, a former SADF officer, Fred Rindel, trained up to 1200 ATU personnel between September 1998 and August 2000, when Rindel cancelled his contract following negative media attention. During 2002 ATU members increasingly were involved in criminal activities such as theft, looting, and murder in Monrovia. More than in the past, the perpetrators were apprehended; however, cases against them remained unresolved at year's end. Two ATU members arrested in November 2001 after looting a private residence in Monrovia were released during 2002. There were many unlawful killings by security forces during 2002. For example, on June 19, an ATU officer and presidential guards opened fire on a taxicab in Monrovia and killed a 6-year-old child and critically injured his mother and the driver. President Taylor ordered an investigation of the incident, which was ongoing at year's end. In September Lt. Isaac Gono, a driver attached to ATU chief Charles Taylor Jr.'s command, was beaten to death by his colleagues as a disciplinary measure for denting a vehicle. Two soldiers were arrested and held for court martial. The trial was opened; however, it later was suspended for unknown reasons, and the case was pending at year's end. Former Deputy Minister of Labor Bedell Fahn and four members of the ATU arrested for torturing two Nigerian men to death in October 2001 were tried during 2002. Fahn was sentenced to 10 months in prison; however, in September he was released. Two ATU members were acquitted and the other two were sentenced to life imprisonment. The National Transitional Government of Liberia disbanded the ATU,United States Department of State accessed February 2009 as part of Liberia's larger post-war demobilisation process.

The main house features a gable roof with two dormers on each side and two interior chimneys connected by a parapet. The house is located at 9 North Front Street and was built by either John Beale Bordley or Charles Torrence circa 1790. The house was the residence of Thorowgood Smith, second Mayor of Baltimore (1804-1808). It rests on an area of downtown Baltimore traditionally known as “Old Town”. Even earlier on, it was known as “Jones Town”. This area was annexed to Baltimore in 1745 and its settlement predates that of Baltimore Town. More specifically, the house is located in a neighborhood known today as Shot Tower Park. Once part of a whole row of Conservative Conservative Georgian style brick masonry -story townhomes, this house is the last extant example on the street, and one of just a few 18th century townhouses remaining in all of Baltimore.
