Centerless grinding differs from centered grinding operations in that no spindle or fixture is used to locate and secure the workpiece; the workpiece is secured between two rotary grinding wheels, and the speed of their rotation relative to each other determines the rate at which material is removed from the workpiece. Centerless grinding is typically used in preference to other grinding processes for operations where many parts must be processed in a short time. Working principle  In centerless grinding, the workpiece is held between two wheels, rotating in the same direction at different speeds, and a workholding platform. One wheel, known as the grinding wheel (stationary wheel in the diagram), is on a fixed axis and rotates such that the force applied to the workpiece is directed downward, against the workholding platform. This wheel usually performs the grinding action by having a higher tangential speed than the workpiece at the point of contact. The other wheel, known as the regulating wheel (moving wheel in the diagram), is movable. This wheel is positioned to apply lateral pressure to the workpiece, and usually has either a very rough or rubber-bonded abrasive to trap the workpiece. The speed of the two wheels relative to each other provides the grinding action and determines the rate at which material is removed from the workpiece. During operation the workpiece turns with the regulating wheel, with the same linear velocity at the point of contact and (ideally) no slipping. The grinding wheel turns faster, slipping past the surface of the workpiece at the point of contact and removing chips of material as it passes. Types There are three forms of centerless grinding, differentiated primarily by the method used to feed the workpiece through the machine. =Through-feed= In through-feed centerless grinding, the workpiece is fed through the grinding wheels completely, entering on one side and exiting on the opposite. The regulating wheel in through-feed grinding is canted away from the plane of the grinding wheel in such a way as to provide an axial force component, feeding the workpiece through between the two wheels. Through-feed grinding can be very efficient because it does not require a separate feed mechanism; however, it can only be used for parts with a simple cylindrical shape. =End-feed= In end-feed centerless grinding, the workpiece is fed axially into the machine on one side and comes to rest against an end stop; the grinding operation is performed, and then the workpiece is fed in the opposite direction to exit the machine. End-feed grinding is best for tapered workpieces. =In-feed= In-feed centerless grinding is used to grind workpieces with relatively complex shapes, such as an hourglass shape. Before the process begins, the workpiece is loaded manually into the grinding machine and the regulating wheel is moved into place. The complexity of the part shapes and grinding wheel shapes required to grind them accurately prevent the workpiece from being fed axially through the machine. Equipment A centerless grinder A close-up of the grinding wheel and back-up wheel Centerless grinding uses purpose-built centerless grinding machines. Such a machine will always include the grinding wheel, regulating wheel, and some means of supporting a workpiece. Modern machines may involve computer numerical control to allow automation and improve precision. Grinding wheels are interchangeable, to allow for different grits and shapes. Machines designed to accommodate through-feed grinding operations will allow the angle of the regulating wheel to be adjusted, to accommodate parts of different sizes.

Hutcheson Memorial Forest is a natural preserve at 2150 Amwell Rd. (Route 514) about 3/4 of a mile east of East Millstone in Franklin Township, Somerset County, NJ. It is known for its untouched stand of old growth forest. The Forest was declared a National Natural Landmark in December 1976. History The area that includes the virgin old growth forest earlier known as Mettler's Woods was acquired from the local Lenape by Dutch settlers in 1701. The old forest was retained by descendants of the original settlers until the mid-1950s. Reportedly, no timber has ever been cut and the ground has never tilled within the forest. The forest canopy is dominated by White Oak, Eastern Black Oak, and Northern Red Oak. American Beech, White Ash, Shagbark Hickory, and Pignut Hickory are also present. The average age of oak trees in the forest is said to be approximately 235 years. Some trees that have died recently have been found to be as old as 350 years. In 1955, after the wood's owner, Thomas Mettler, considered selling the property, the Citizen's Scientific and Historical Committee for the Preservation of Mettler's Woods raised funds from a variety of sources, including a significant contribution from the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America to purchase it. It was turned over to the care of Rutgers University and The Nature Conservancy after being named for the union’s recent president, William L. Hutcheson. Franklin Township and the New Jersey Green Acres Program have also worked in partnership with the caretakers to help preserve and protect this locally rare and important natural resource. Hours Entrance to forest The preserve is open from dawn until dusk by appointment. Also, the public is welcome on the regularly scheduled tours given approximately every third Sunday at 2pm throughout the year.

Throughout the dynasty, various regional and ideological factions struggled for dominance in the political system. Village Seowon, which combined the functions of Confucian shrines with educational institutions, often reflected the factional alignment of the local elite. During the earlier period of Joseon in 15th and 16th century, tension between the Hungu faction in the Capital and the Yeongnam- based Sarim faction dominated national politics, which culminated in a series of four bloody purges between 1498 and 1545, in which Sarim faction was persecuted by the Hungu faction. Following these setbacks, the Sarim faction withdrew to rural provinces where they maintained power base and ideological continuity through Seowon and Hyang'yak (a system of social contract that gave local autonomy to villages). Eventually, the Hungu faction declined without an ideological successor while the Sarim faction emerged as the dominant faction during the reign of Seonjo. In the 16th century, a nationwide split occurred within the Sarim faction between the Western faction (Seo-in) and Eastern faction (Dong-in), composed mainly of younger generation. Political divisions intensified even further as the Eastern faction in turn split between the hard-line Northern faction (Buk-in) and the moderate Southern faction (Nam- in)Lee (1984), p. 221. and the Western factions split between the Old Learning (No-ron) and the Young Learning (So-ron), these four factions sometimes known as sasaek (\\"four colors\\").Seth (2005), p. 146. The Northern faction further split into the Greater Northern and Smaller Northern factions. The faction names often derived from the relative location of their leader's house. These factional splits grew out of allegiance to different philosophical schools and regional differences. For instance, the Eastern faction was largely Youngnam- based, and its subfaction the Southerners were mainly followers of Yi Hwang while the Northerners coalesced around the school of Jo Shik. The Gyeonggi and Chungcheong-based Western faction were largely followers of Yi I, of which followers of Seong Hon split to form the So-ron faction and Song Siyeol's followers became the No-ron faction. These divisions were often further driven by questions concerning royal succession or appropriate royal conduct. For example, the split between the Northerners and Southerners was driven by debate over the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son. The Northerners came to support the Gwanghaegun; accordingly, they flourished under his reign (1608–1623) but were swept from power by the Westerners after the succession of Injo. Under the reigns of Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the 18th century, a strict policy of equality was pursued with no faction being favoured over another.Lee (1984), p. 223. However, in Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged as the ruling No-ron faction split further between the Byeokpa and Sipa, two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father. In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne. For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong Kim clan was in control of the government; however, there was a brief interlude in which control shifted to the Pungyang Cho clan. During the reign of Gojong, real power initially belonged to his father the Heungseon Daewongun, who on one hand sought to reform corrupt state institutions but on the other hand pursued a policy of isolationism, opposing the opening of the country to Western and Japanese influences. From the 1870s onwards, Queen Min (known posthumously as Empress Myeongseong) became more dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernisation and opening up. Her dominance was opposed by reactionaries and progressives alike. The Enlightenment Party (also known as Progressives) sought to modernise the country along Western and Japanese lines. These factional struggles led to the Imo Incident and Gapsin Coup, as well as increased foreign interference in Korean affairs.

The Other Side of Truth, was published by Puffin in 2000, is a story about political corruption and how that affects the lives of the children of an outspoken writer. For that work she won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Naidoo won the Josette Frank Award twice – in 1986 for Journey to Jo'burg and in 1997 for No Turning Back: A Novel of South Africa. Biography Beverley Naidoo was born on the 21st May 1943 in Johannesburg, South Africa. She grew up under apartheid laws that gave privilege to white children. Black children were sent to separate, inferior schools and their families were told where they could live, work and travel. Apartheid denied all children the right to grow up together with equality, justice and respect. As a student, Beverley began to question racism and the idea that white people were superior. At 21 she was arrested for taking part in the resistance movement. In 1965 Beverley came to England. She married another South African exile. Apartheid laws forbade marriage between white and black people and barred them living together with their children in South Africa. As a child Beverley always loved stories but only started writing when her own children were growing up. Her first book, Journey to Jo'burg, won The Other Award in Britain. It opened a window onto children's struggles under apartheid. In South Africa it was banned until 1991, the year after Nelson Mandela was released from jail. A few years later, when the parents of all South African children had the right to vote for the first time, Nelson Mandela was elected president. Books Journey to Jo'burg, Chain of Fire, The other side of truth and Out of Bounds are set in South Africa under apartheid, while No Turning Back concerns the experiences of a boy trying to survive on the streets of Johannesburg in the immediate post-apartheid years.

It was released on 21 April 2007, through Warner Music Australia. Six singles were released from the album. The first single \\"20 Good Reasons\\", became Thirsty Merc's first single to peak in the Top 10 on the Australian Singles Chart. The second single from the album was \\"The Hard Way\\", followed by \\"Those Eyes\\", which was released as a digital download in December 2007, only later to be released on CD in April 2008. \\"Homesick\\" was released as the fourth single digitally, making available for the first time a single mix of the track. This was followed by a double radio release of singles five and six, \\"The Whole World Reminds Me of You\\" and \\"Crying in Denial\\", both of which garnered highly successful airplay runs in a radio edit form. Slideshows marks the first album with guitarist Sean Carey, since joining the band just after the first studio album's release. As with the band's first album, Slideshows is produced by Lindsay Gravina and engineered by Rob Long. The album is currently featured on NineMSN, with all of its songs available for streaming download.NineMSN Artist Feature on Slideshows. Cover art The cover art is a high contrast silhouetted Polaroid photo of the band standing in a line (from left to right: Rai Thistlethwayte, Sean Carey, Phil Stack and Karl Robertson) but you cannot see their faces. The silhouettes are dark brown against an amber background. The whole image is distressed, giving it an \\"aged\\" look. The logo for Thirsty Merc is different from the debut EP and studio album (which were both the same as one another), in a Cooper type font with some graphic fill-art above. As the photos were from a polaroid camera (or at least made to look like they were) the polaroid white border and image artifacts found in a polaroid image are not trimmed but featured on the images throughout and on the cover, further providing a \\"distressed\\" feel. The cover of the rear of the album is a photo of the band and, alike to the front cover, in high contrast, however not as high and the image is not silhouetted, so you can see the band member's faces. The inside slip maintains the colours throughout, remaining in brown, amber and general autumn colours. The single \\"20 Good Reasons\\" uses the same basic colours, logo and a similar high contrast image, consistent with the album. Songs The album includes twelve songs, and they are, according to the band, more mature than those featured on their debut album. The first song publicly and widely released was \\"The Vision\\", in January 2007 on the band's official website, followed by \\"20 Good Reasons\\" a few weeks later, which was then announced and released as the album's first single. The band has since removed \\"The Vision\\" from their MySpace page, replacing it with \\"The Hard Way\\", which has been confirmed as the second single from the album. Track listing Originally, there were two distinct versions of the album's track listing advertised, one from the band's own website and another from several other sources. The main difference between the two versions of the track listing was that the song \\"The Whole World Reminds Me of You\\" was not included on the listing on the band's own website. As this is the only song that uses the word \\"fuck\\", it's a possibility this track listing was one that was proposed to avoid a language warning label. Otherwise, the only difference was the track sequence. Notably, both versions began with \\"She's All I Got\\" and end with \\"Homesick.\\" The version released was the iTunes and Warner Music version, meanwhile the track listing on the band's own website remains as it originally was; however, no versions in stores or online contain the track listing from their site.

The paper argued that from the analysis of the reaction of the British population to the Blitz, the demolition of people's houses was the most effective way to affect their morale, even more effective than killing relatives. Given the known limits of the RAF in locating targets in Germany and providing the planned resources were made available to the RAF, destroying about thirty percent of the housing stock of Germany's fifty-eight largest towns was the most effective use of the aircraft of RAF Bomber Command, because it would break the spirit of the Germans. After a heated debate by the government's military and scientific advisers, the Cabinet chose the strategic bombing campaign over the other options available to them. Production and contents of the dehousing paper The paper came at a time while Bomber Command was in an enforced period of much reduced bombing. The Butt report had shown that bombing results were poor, and with the attrition rate it had been suffering in operations, the effort expended gave a poor return. Since November 1941 the RAF had been husbanding its resources and awaiting the introduction of large numbers of four-engined heavy bombersThe Short Stirling was the RAF's first \\"heavy\\" in early 1941, followed by the Handley Page Halifax later in 1941 and the Avro Lancaster entered service in mid-1942 and the GEE radio-navigational device into frontline service. Bombing policy had already moved away from attempts at precision bombing. The paper was produced by Cherwell using an analysis of recent raids on British cities then being undertaken. The information was given by the researchers in response to questions posed by Cherwell. Contemporary debate, the Butt and Singleton reports The dehousing paper had been delivered to Churchill at a time of mounting criticism about the RAF bomber offensive. The criticism was coming from other branches inside the War ministry and was also becoming public. It had started with a report initiated by Cherwell and delivered on 18 August 1941 by D. M. Bensusan-Butt, a member of the War Cabinet Secretariat.Bensusan- Butt had been private secretary to Cherwell and part of an Admiralty statistical section under Churchill. The report based on analysis of aerial photographs concluded that less than one third of sorties flown got within of the target. As Bensusan-Butt did not include those aircraft that did not bomb because of equipment failure, enemy action, weather or getting lost, the reality was that about 5% of bombers setting out bombed within five miles of their target.Hank Nelson A different war: Australians in Bomber Command a paper presented at the 2003 History Conference - Air War Europe Senior RAF commanders argued that the Butt report's statistics were faulty and commissioned another report. This report was delivered by the Directorate of Bombing Operations on 22 September 1941. Working from a damage analysis inflicted on British cities it was calculated that with a bomber force of 4,000 aircraft they could destroy the forty-three German towns with a population of more than 100,000. The Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Charles Portal argued that with such a force RAF Bomber Command could win the war in six months. Not all were convinced and when Churchill expressed his doubts the Air Staff said that even if it did not knock Germany out of the war it would weaken them sufficiently to allow British armed forces back into continental Europe. With this compromise between the armed services, Bomber Command was allowed to keep its planned allocation of war materiel. This did not stop those outside the Chiefs of Staff questioning the strategic bombing policy. A particularly damning speech had been delivered in the House of Commons by the Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, Professor A. V. HillHill had worked with Blackett and Tizard before the war. who pointed out that \\"The total [British] casualties in air-raids – in killed – since the beginning of the war are only two-thirds of those we lost as prisoners of war at Singapore. ... The loss of production in the worst month of the Blitz was about equal to that due to the Easter holidays. ... The Air Ministry have been ... too optimistic. ... We know most of the bombs we drop hit nothing of importance.\\" Thus, the Secretary of State for Air, Sir Archibald Sinclair and Sir Charles Portal were delighted by the dehousing paper as it offered support to them in their battle to save the strategic bomber offensive, which had been under attack from others in the high command who thought that the resources put into Bomber Command were damaging the other branches of the armed services with little to show for it. Portal and Sinclair still expressed their reservations that it could be met. On reading the dehousing paper, Professor Patrick Blackett, the newly appointed civilian Director of Naval Operational Research,Blackett had, until January, been carrying out Operational Research for RAF Coastal Command in their battle with German U-boats. wrote that the paper's estimate of what could be achieved was 600% too high. The principal advocate for the reduction of RAF Bomber Command in favour of other options was Sir Henry Tizard. He argued that the only benefit to strategic bombing was that it tied up enemy resources defending Germany and that those forces could be tied up with a far smaller bombing offensive. He wrote to Cherwell on 15 April querying the facts in the paper and warning that the War Cabinet could reach the wrong decision if they based it on the paper. Tizard had several doubts – that the stated size bomber force could be achieved (only 7,000 bombers, not the 10,000 expected); that new navigational aids that would get the aircraft to the targets would not be ready before 1943; and that it was unlikely that more than 25% of the bombs were likely to land on target. As such the strategy would not work with the resources available, and that far bigger effort would be required. In reply to Tizard, Cherwell stated the calculations were for the Prime Minister's benefit, not for statistical analysis, and that despite a difference between the numbers and what was really achieved there would be catastrophic effects. In his work Bomber Command Max Hastings characterises the debate between the two sides as not being whether bombing could \\"raze [Germany] to the ground\\", but whether it was the most effective allocation of resources. Mr. Justice Singleton, a High Court judge, was asked by the Cabinet to look into the competing points of view. In his report, delivered on 20 May 1942 he concluded that: In the end, thanks in part to the dehousing paper, it was this view which prevailed, but C. P. Snow (later Lord Snow) wrote that the debate became quite vitriolic with Tizard being called a defeatist. Cites pp. 49–51 in either Snow Science and Government (1961) or Snow A Postscript to Science and Government (1962) (Longmate simply says Snow science on page 393, but lists both books in the sources (page 387)) It was while this debate about bombing was raging inside the British military establishment that the area bombing directive of 14 February 1942 was issued and eight days later that Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris took up the post of Air Officer Commanding (AOC) of Bomber Command. The study of the effects of bombing on Hull and Birmingham was published on 8 April by Professors Bernal and Zuckerman after Cherwell's paper had been presented. Their work, the \\"Hull and Birmingham Survey\\" had actually found that although there was anxiety as a result of the raids, there was no mass anti-social behaviour and \\"no measurable effect on the health of either town\\".

Early life and background Gudi was born in 1941 at Jalihal, Dharwad, Karnataka to Subhadra and Gururajachar Gudi, a family of Keertankars and Harikatha (devotional) musicians. His grandfather, Seshachar, was a Carnatic music vocalist and his father was a well-known Keertankar in Dharwad. Gudi was introduced to music at a very early age. Young Madhav would often accompany his father to his Keertana programs which had a great influence on him and paved the way towards his musical career. Musical Training His rich and sonorous voice encouraged his father to introduce him to musical training under the tutelage of Pandit Nageshrao Deshpande, the great maestro from whom Gudi received his formal initiation into Hindustani classical music. Gudi was about 12 years old when he first heard Bhimsen Joshi at the first edition of the Sawai Gandharva Music Festival. Later when Bhimsen Joshi had come to visit Jalihal Srinivasachar, a renowned senior spiritual teacher, young Madhav was introduced to Bhimsen Joshi by Srinivasachar and advised Joshi to listen to Gudi's music. Madhav Gudi demonstrated his musical talent by singing Bhimsen Joshi's songs from Kannada plays like Bhagya Nidhi and Parivartana. At the advice of Pandit Jalihal Srinivasachar and Pandit Keshavacharya Jalihal, Joshi agreed to take Madhav Gudi under his guidance and bestowed upon him the glorious tradition of his music. Thus began a new chapter in Pandit Gudi's life. In a true Guru-Shishya milieu which lasted well over twenty-five years, Pandit Madhav Gudi, the musician and performer was sculpted. Gudi mostly lived in Pune as part of Joshi's family for 26 years. That made him Joshi's most trusted disciple, and the richest source of knowledge about the life & times of one of the greatest musicians of this century. For a year and a half, Joshi didn't teach Gudi much. Once Joshi was convinced that Gudi was a deserving student, he started imparting his training to Gudi. For five years Joshi taught him only three ragas. Todi in the morning, Multani in the afternoon, and Puriya at night. Personal life Gudi was married to Ramabai at the age of 30 years. They had four children - Anupama, Prasanna, Bhargavi and Gayatri. Career Gudi's voice was well suited for Hindustani classical as well as light classical (Dasavani and Abhang) music. A top-grade All India Radio artiste, he toured all over India and performed with Pandit Bhimsen Joshi at several programmes in India and overseas. Known for his melodious yet powerful voice, Madhav Gudi possessed an unparalleled collection of many different styles of compositions in many different languages. He specialised in Khataka, Murki, variety of Taans, Aakaara (Alaap), Ukaara & Makaara. Gudi has also trained many musicians in Hindustani Classical and devotional music. His students include his daughters - Anupama Mangalvede, Gayatri & Bhargavi, son Prasanna Gudi, brothers - Raghavendra Gudi & Sheshagiri Gudi, Bhimsen Mannur, Nagaraj Hawaldar, Uday Nayak, Sanjiv Chimmalgi, Sanjiv Jahagirdar, Upendra Bhat, Shrinivas Sawai, Shrivallabh Mulgund, Sham Alur, Ramesh Kulkarni, Anuradha Bhadri, Dilip Joshi, Sangeeta Katti, grandson Shriniketan, Uday Nayak, Nilam Sharma, Radha Bhat, Radha Mehta, Nandan Jodi, Nachiket Sharma, among others. Gudi was also the composer of the devotional songs 'Sriniketana' and 'Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma' which were popularised by Bhimsen Joshi. Awards Among several accolades that he received were the Sangeeta Nritya Academy award from the Government of Karnataka, Surashri, Gaana Bhaskar, Smt Vatsala Tai Joshi Award by the hands of Legendary Dr. Prabha Atre, Gaana Kala Tilaka and the Yashavant Rao Chauhan Samata Gaurav Puraskar.

The styling of Art Deco buildings in Durban reflects the different backgrounds of the city's population. Some buildings, such as Quadrant House on the Victoria Embankment, emphasise the city's maritime background. Other buildings, such as Ebrahim Court and the Essop Moosa Building, are built in a style reflecting the interests of Durban's Muslim traders in the 1930s. Some of the buildings pay allegiance to Durban's long association with the British Empire, such as Empire Court and Dominion Court.  Notable examples  Some notable examples of the Art Deco style in Durban: * Berea Court (Berea Road West, Berea) * Colonial Mutual Building (West Street, Durban Central) * Memorial Tower Building (University of KwaZulu-Natal, Howard College Campus) * Surrey Mansions (Currie Road, Berea) *Kintyre (Clark Road, Glenwood) *Jubilee Court (Clarence Road, Morningside) The cenotaph in the central square outside the City Hall is another striking Art Deco construction.

Both islands belong to the district of Locarno, in the canton of Ticino. San Pancrazio (also known as Grande Isola) is the larger and is well known for its botanical garden. On the smaller of the islands, known as Isolino, or Isola Piccola or Isola di Sant’Apollinare, the vegetation is allowed to develop naturally. Both benefit from the mild climate provided by the lake. The minimum distance from the shore is 1,040 metres for San Pancrazio and 930 metres for Sant'Apollinare, making them the farthest islands from the shore in Switzerland. Both islands culminate at 200 metres above sea level or 7 metres above lake level (193 m). History Roman remains have been found on San Pancrazio. The islands were used as a refuge by early Christians. In the thirteenth century nuns of the Humiliati order built a monastery on San Pancrazio, while the local parish also built around this time the Church of S. Pancrazio. After the suppression of the Humiliati in 1571 by Pope Pius V, the order's property was given to the hospital in Locarno and the islands became uninhabited. =St Leger= In 1885 an Anglo-Irishman of the St. Leger family, Richard Fleming, and his Russian-born wife, Antoniette (née Bayer, 1856 to 1948) purchased the Brissago Islands. On San Pancrazio they constructed a large house and then began to create a botanical garden, which required bringing by boat to the island earth and manure. In 1897 Richard Fleming left the islands for Naples where he worked at the British Consulate and died in 1922. Antoniette remained and continued to develop the garden. During this later period the writer James Joyce visited the island and stayed at her house. Between 1886 and 1914, Antoinette de Saint Léger (as she called herself) hosted on the island the painters Danielle Ranzoni, Filippo Franzoni and Giovanni Segantini and the composer Ruggero Leoncavallo. After the end of World War I she also hosted James Joyce, Rainer Maria Rilke and Harry Graf Kessler. After the First World War, due to poor investments she was deeply in debt and in 1927 she was forced to sell the property. She moved first to Ascona and then to Intragna, where public assistance supported her until her death, on 24 January 1948. =Max Emden= In 1928 Hamburg department store king Max Emden purchased the islands, demolished the existing house and replaced it with a neoclassical villa. The villa had 30 rooms, a conservatory and a 33 metre long swimming pool. While not really into botany and gardening he retained the existing garden and vegetation, while at the same time undertaking all the necessary the maintenance. Emden lived on the islands until his death in a clinic in Locarno in 1940. =Purchase by the public= In 1949, Emden's son Hans Erich, who had emigrated to Chile accepted an offer from a consortium consisting of the Canton Ticino, the municipalities of Ascona, Brissago and Ronco sopra Ascona, plus the Swiss Nature Protection League (known today as the Swiss Heritage Society) to purchase the islands. The purchase agreement was signed on 2 September 1949. On the morning of 2 April 1950 the Brissago Islands were opened to the public. Parco botanico del Canton Ticino While the smaller island has been left in its natural state, the botanical garden (Parco botanico del Canton Ticino) on San Pancrazio is home to approximately 1,500 plant species, among which are azaleas, rhododendrons, Japanese palm trees, numerous camellias, Japanese banana, bamboo, magnolia, agaves, cypress, yucca, California poppies. The garden today covers 2.5 hectares and receives more than 90 000 visitors a year. Today the villa contains a restaurant and the administration offices of the Botanical Park of Canton Ticino.

On 20 July 1939 the ETR 200 number 12 obtained the world record average speed, between Bologna and Milan. Development and records In the 1930s, the Italian state railways, Ferrovie dello Stato, electrified the main line Milan-Bologna-Florence-Rome-Naples and needed a fast train to use on it and on other newly electrified ones. The project was started in 1934, using new technologies for steel and aerodynamics. The innovative nose of the train was developed after studies in the wind tunnel at the Politecnico di Torino engineering university. The first example was built by Società Italiana Ernesto Breda, (now AnsaldoBreda), in 1936, an articulated and traction-distributed train with three cars on four bogies, two of which were Jacobs bogies, had a single T 62-R-100 motor, while the others—at the front and rear—were provided with two similar motors each. The train had been designed for speeds up to , but the first pantographs caused problems over . The ETR 200 entered service in 1937 on the Bologna-Rome-Naples line. They were considered the most comfortable and fast trains in Europe, and Benito Mussolini had one sent to 1939 New York World's Fair. On 6 December 1937 the ETR 201The numbering of FS high speed trainsets is historically different from the \\"standard\\" trainset codification, and is composed by a first number, identifying the group, plus a progressive 2-digit number identifying the unit.

Later, the group was upgraded to group 220/230/240, and unit 212 became 232 reached a top speed of on the Rome-Naples line (between the stations of Campoleone and Nettunia). On 20 July 1939, the ETR 212, driven by driver Alessandro Cervellati, established a new world record running (on the average speed for the whole run) between Florence and Milan at , and also improving the absolute top speed record up to in the stretch from Pontenure to Piacenza. A popular myth held that Benito Mussolini himself was at the controls, but it doesn't hold to historical evidence. Later history The production of the ETR 200 was halted by World War II, and many were damaged by Allied bombings. In the early 1960s the remaining sixteen units were converted to ETR 220/230/240 by adding a fourth car and making other improvements. They remained in service until the early 1980s, and were later used for charter trains up until the 1990s. The ETR 232, former 212 (the unit making the 1939 record run), has been preserved as a historical train and is in full working order. Another non-working unit was first stored in Ancona until its scrapping in September 2012.

It is the third novel in The Dresden Files, which follows the character of Harry Dresden, present-day Chicago's only professional wizard. Plot summary Dresden and Michael Carpenter, a Knight of the Cross, try to track down a bewildered but dangerous ghost in Cook County Hospital, are nearly ensnared by Dresden's faerie godmother the Leanansidhe, then arrested by the Chicago police. Harry is bailed out by his girlfriend Susan Rodriguez, then receives an official invitation to represent the White Council at a Red Court vampire party. He refuses to allow Susan to accompany him. While trying to rescue a young seer, Lydia, Harry is attacked by two Red Court vampires (Kyle and Kelly Hamilton). Kelly also sexually assaults him. He manages to injure Kelly by pulling down the roof of a warehouse, and is sent into a narcotic slumber. He has a flashback dream in which he recalls events three or four months prior, when Special Investigations, Michael, and he to capture Leonid Kravos, a sorcerer, cult leader and serial killer. The dream ends up diverging from reality; in the dream, a demon summoned by Kravos kills Michael and eats Dresden alive. When Dresden awakens, he discovers that the Nightmare's dream attack was both real and powerful, draining Harry of much of his magic. Harry realizes that the Nightmare will attack his friends and allies. He tries to warn police lieutenant Karrin Murphy and discovers that she believes he's already in her office. In Harry's guise, the Nightmare puts Murphy in a nightmare-filled coma. Dresden tries to help by putting Murphy into a dreamless sleep that he says will last until dawn. He then goes to Michael's house to warn him, but Michael's nine-months-pregnant wife Charity has gone to a 24-hour convenience store and, while there, meets the Nightmare disguised as Harry. Dresden (followed closely by Michael) tracks down the Nightmare to Graceland Cemetery, but is losing his struggle with it when the Leanansidhe appears again. She aids him in return for his pledge of service, but after he drives the Nightmare away and rescues Charity he tries to use Michael's sacred sword, Amoracchius, to break his pledge to the Leanansidhe, an act of treachery allowing her to seize the sword for herself. Charity, injured and in labor, is brought to Cook County Hospital. Dresden tries to get medical care for his own wounds and learns that Lea healed his exterior injuries, leading the doctor on duty to scorn the idea that he could need medical care. Stallings, Murphy's partner, sees Dresden and tells him that though it is past dawn, Murphy has not awakened. He also provides Dresden with Kravos's journals, which Stallings stole from the police evidence locker. Dresden then goes to the nursery floor to find Michael and discovers that Michael's son has been born and that the baby is dying. Dresden persuades Michael not to remain at the hospital but to come help him instead. For nearly twelve hours, they gather ingredients for a summoning spell. Just before sunset, Dresden summons the Nightmare and tries to exorcise it. This does not work. Dresden then casts a spell forcing the Nightmare to focus its attention on him, ignoring his friends. Dresden and Michael go to the Red Court party, suspecting they will find the enemy controlling the Nightmare. Susan, who had tried calling Dresden while he was performing the exorcism, arrives with a forged invitation, unwittingly forsaking the pledge of safe conduct extended to legitimate invitees. The Leanansidhe also attends. Harry swallows a goblet of wine spiked with Red Court vampire saliva (which is both narcotic and addictive, and which he had been exposed to the day before). The Leanansidhe tricks Susan into trading a year's worth of memories of Dresden to her in return for a cure. As Harry and Michael try to safely extricate Susan from the party, they encounter Mavra, who is both a noble from another vampire Court and the sorceress controlling the Nightmare. Mavra plans to defile Michael's sword by murdering Lydia, now her prisoner, with it, in order to take revenge on Michael for killing her children and grandchildren twenty years earlier. Harry and Michael ally with Thomas Raith, a noble of the rival White Court. They try to rescue Lydia and retake the sword, but the Red Court hostess, Bianca, offers Thomas a trade--if he will betray Dresden, Michael, and Susan, Bianca will leave his lover/food source Justine alone. Thomas agrees and kicks Susan into a crowd of Red Court vampires, who proceed to feed on her. Incoherent with rage, Dresden unleashes an unusually potent incineration spell, slaughtering many of the Red Court. He collapses, and Michael manages to drag both Dresden and Lydia to safety. Thomas and Justine are captured. Dresden spends the next couple of days unconscious. Michael takes care of him. When he awakens, Thomas arrives at Dresden's apartment, offering Michael Amoracchius in exchange for an alliance to rescue both Susan and Justine. Lydia, now possessed by the Nightmare, attacks Dresden, throwing him across the room. Thomas uses his incubus powers to make himself irresistible to the Nightmare, which is now controlling Lydia's body; this leads to a scene where the Nightmare is trying to rape Thomas by using Lydia's body. Dresden tries to exorcise Lydia, but discovers that the Nightmare is not a demon but actually the ghost of Leonid Kravos, who (Dresden presumes) committed ritual suicide in order to empower his ghost and break down the barriers between the living and the dead. Dresden, Thomas and Michael heads toward Bianca's stronghold through the Nevernever. They meet the Leanansidhe on the way, but Thomas and Michael distract her long enough for Dresden to eat a poisonous mushroom which will kill him if he does not get treatment as soon as possible. Coerced, Lea agrees to free him for now and not to attack him in the mortal world for a year and a day. Lea, however, gets around that by calling on other fairy creatures to attack him while he's in the Nevernever rather than the mortal world. Thomas and Michael fight the fairy creatures and Dresden heads to Bianca's manor. He reaches the manor... but he is captured by Bianca and perhaps a dozen other vampires, who knew that a possible \\"door\\" to the Nevernever existed in this spot. They swiftly strip him of his weapons and his clothes. Bianca then rapes him genitally, transforming into her giant bat form as she does so, while the other vampires use their mouths to violate him (thus reinforcing the addiction the vampire Kelly Hamilton infected him with during the fight over the seer Lydia). He eventually blacks out. When he awakens, he is imprisoned with Justine and Susan. Susan has been half-turned to a Red Court vampire; the transition will be completed if she feeds on Dresden and kills him. Dresden forestalls her nascent bloodlust by casting a spell restoring her memories. Kravos attacks, and Dresden tricks him into stopping his heart. Because the barriers have been weakened, Harry's powerful ghost appears as Susan resuscitates him with CPR. Harry and his ghost defeat Kravos, recapturing his own stolen power and draining Kravos's strength as well. After Harry's ghost dissipates, Bianca attacks, but before the barriers can re-establish themselves Harry unleashes the spirits of Bianca's many victims against her and escapes with Susan and Justine. Harry's actions have precipitated a war between the vampire Red Court and the White Council of wizards. Susan rejects Harry's marriage proposal and leaves Chicago, knowing that her half-vampiric condition would impel her to kill him in any moment of weakness.

Emerson made his living as a lecturer in New England and beyond; by the 1850s he was giving as many as 80 per year.Richardson, Robert D., Jr. Emerson: The Mind on Fire. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1995: 418. He eventually gave some 1,500 lectures in his lifetime. His earnings allowed him to expand his property, buying of land by Walden Pond and a few more acres in a neighboring pine grove. He wrote that he was \\"landlord and waterlord of 14 acres, more or less\\".Packer, Barbara L. The Transcendentalists. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 2007: 150. In April 1841, Thoreau accepted an invitation to move into Bush with the family. As Emerson described to his brother William: \\"He is to have his board, etc., for what labor he chooses to do, and he is thus far a great benefactor... for he is an indefatigable and very skillful laborer\\".Schreiner, Samuel A., Jr. The Concord Quartet: Alcott, Emerson, Hawthorne, Thoreau, and the Friendship that Freed the American Mind. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley and Sons, 2006: 87–88. Thoreau later built his well- known cabin on Emerson's property at Walden Pond. After his experiment in living deliberately, he returned to Bush in September 1847 and stayed there until the next July.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 45. While living in the house, Emerson published his book of Essays in 1841, as well as a second series of essays in 1844. He also published two volumes of poetry, Poems in 1846 and May-Day and Other Pieces in 1867.Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 44. The house caught fire on the morning of July 24, 1872, and Emerson ran out to call for help from neighbors.Felton, R. Todd. A Journey into the Transcendentalists' New England. Berkeley, California: Roaring Forties Press, 2006: 68. After the fire was put out, friends took up a collection to pay for repairs, raising some $12,000 in total, and sending the Emersons to Europe and Egypt while the house was restored. In 1873 the Emersons returned to reoccupy the house. Emerson died in the house in 1882, and in 1892 his wife Lidian followed. Their daughter Ellen Tucker Emerson, who remained unmarried, lived in the house until her death in 1909. Other friends and relatives lived here until 1948. House today Today the house is still owned by the family.Shmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon. Novel Destinations: Literary Landmarks from Jane Austen's Bath to Ernest Hemingway's Key West. National Geographic Society, 2008: 62. It was first opened to the public in 1930 as a private museum; it continues to operate as a museum, open on a seasonal basis. The interior furnishings remain much as they did when Emerson lived in the home, with original furniture and Emerson's memorabilia. The exception is the furniture and books from his study, which are now on display in the Concord Museum across the street.Shmidt, Shannon McKenna and Joni Rendon.

It is owned and operated by Global as part of the Smooth network. History =GMG Radio= The station launched following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations in London and the North West. The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio and so Saga 105.7 FM was closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007. This was then followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio giving listeners the chance to hear the presenters and music which would be on the new station. Local programming originated from studios in Birmingham. Networked programming was syndicated from sister station Smooth North West at Salford Quays, Manchester. In 2010, it was announced that it would be merging its five Smooth stations in England to create a nationwide Smooth Radio service based in Manchester. The new station was launched on 4 October 2010 and could be heard both on DAB and on the locally on the FM frequencies. =Global= Smooth Radio's output was relocated to new owner Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October 2013, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. In September 2019, following OFCOM's decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth's local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London.Smooth Radio poaches Angie Greaves for national Drive, Radio Today, 29 May 2019 Local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained, alongside the station's West Midlands breakfast show.  Station format  Smooth West Midlands plays middle-of-the-road, adult contemporary music, aimed at listeners aged 35 and over. It had few similarities to its predecessor. Some of the specialist shows from the Saga days survived initially, but were gradually replaced with a more contemporary format. Smooth's initial slogan Your Life, Your Music, which was used on Saga stations, was modified to Love Life, Love Music to enhance Smooth's promise to play the best choice of music from the previous four decades. The music policy at Smooth ranged from the late '60s right up to the present date, with a heavy focus on easy listening songs. On 1 March 2014, a new slogan Your Relaxing Music Mix was introduced. Programming Local programming is produced and broadcast from Global's Birmingham studios from 6-10am with Smooth Breakfast with Nigel Freshman on weekdays. All networked programming originates from Global's London headquarters, including The Smooth Drive Home with Angie Greaves.Smooth Radio - West Midlands public file =News= Global's Newsroom broadcasts hourly regional news bulletins from 6 am – 7 pm on weekdays and 6 am – noon on weekends.

It existed in portions of Wilkinson and Baldwin counties. The former portion of SR 243 that was concurrent with U.S. Route 441 Business (US 441 Bus.) was redesignated as US 29 Bus. The portion from southwest of Gordon to north-northeast of Ivey, as well as the later roadway that was built from that point to southeast pf Milledgeville became concurrent with SR 540, the state highway designation for the Fall Line Freeway (FLF; a highway that connects Columbus with Augusta), and was replaced in 2019 by an extended SR 540\\\\. The entire final routing of the highway may be incorporated into the proposed eastern extension of Interstate 14 (I-14), which is currently entirely within Central Texas and may be extended into Augusta. Route description Former SR 243 began at an intersection with SR 57/SR 540 (Fall Line Freeway/Maddox Road) southwest of Gordon, in Wilkinson County. At this intersection, it began a concurrency with SR 540 as part of the Fall Line Freeway. The two highways traveled to the north-northeast. After a curve to the northeast, they crossed over Little Commissioner Creek and some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway. Here, they briefly entered the far western part of Gordon. After leaving the city limits of Gordon, they intersected SR 18 (Gray Highway). They curved to the east-southeast and re- entered Gordon. They left the city limits again. After a curve to the north- northeast, they briefly re-entered the city for a final time. After curving to the north-northeast, they crossed over Lake Tchukolaho on the McCook Bridge. They traveled through the town of Ivey, where they crossed over Beaver Creek and skirted past Brooks Lake. They curved to the northeast to an intersection where SR 540 split off to the northeast and SR 243 turned left to the north- northwest. After the highway separated from the Fall Line Freeway, it had a more northerly routing. Almost immediately, SR 243 entered Baldwin County and crossed a Central of Georgia Railway line. The highway curved to the northeast until it reached the unincorporated community of Scottsboro. There, it had an intersection with US 441/SR 29\\\\. After the intersection, SR 243 was concurrent with US 441 Business for the rest of its length. The highway headed north through Hardwick, and entered Milledgeville. It crossed over Fishing Creek on the Mayor Harry G. Bone Bridge. US 441 Business/SR 243 traveled north into downtown Milledgeville, along South Wayne Street. They turned left on West Franklin Street, passed Memory Hill Cemetery, and then turned right on South Clark Street before intersecting SR 49 (West Hancock Street). Just after this intersection, the two highways traveled along the southwestern edge of Georgia College, and intersected SR 22/SR 24 (West Montgomery Street). Here, SR 243 met its northern terminus, while US 441 Business continued north. The only sections of former SR 243 that were part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility and defense, were the section that traveled along the Fall Line Freeway and the section that was concurrent with US 441 Business. History SR 243 was established in 1946 along an alignment from Gordon to Scottsboro. By 1952, the section from the southern terminus to about Ivey and a section just southwest of Scottsboro were paved. In 1953, the entire route from Gordon to Scottsboro was paved.. Between 2013 and 2015, a new road was built from SR 243 north-northeast of Ivey to US 441/SR 29 south-southeast of Scottsboro. The segment between the Scottsboro and Sandersville areas was completed and opened to traffic in October 2016. In 2016, the new portion of highway was extended to SR 24 southeast of Milledgeville, and SR 243 was shifted onto it. The entire portion that had been concurrent with US 441 Bus. in Milledgeville was redesignated as SR 29 Bus. Between the beginning of 2017 and the beginning of 2019, SR 243 was decommissioned, with its final routing being entirely replaced by SR 540.

The pope, a cardinal, a monk, and a demon try to blow the candle out. Calvinism originated with the teachings of John Calvin in the 16th century. The Reformation in Switzerland when Huldrych Zwingli began preaching what would become the first form of the Reformed doctrine in Zürich in 1519. Zwingli and John Oecolampadius became embroiled in conflict over the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist with Martin Luther, leading to a division between Lutheran and Reformed Protestants. Several theologians succeeded Zwingli, the best known of which is John Calvin in Geneva, but other reformers like John Oecolampadius, Heinrich Bullinger, Peter Martyr Vermigli, and Wolfgang Musculus were also very influential in the development of Reformed theology. Reformed faith spread throughout Europe in the 16th century, with different character in different places. Calvinism was the dominant form of Protestantism in France. After a period of struggle Calvinists were officially tolerated there. Under the leadership of John Knox the Church of Scotland, which was Reformed, became the established church in Scotland. In the Netherlands, Calvinism also became the official established religion following a period of persecution. During the Reformation, Calvinism was the primary Protestant faith in Belgium but was eradicated in favor of the Counter- Reformation. Germany remained predominantly Lutheran during the 16th century, but Reformed worship was promoted intermittently by rulers in Electoral Palatinate, Margraviate of Brandenburg, and other German states. Reformed ideas also influenced Protestants in Eastern Europe, especially Hungary and Romania. The reform of the Church of England was also influenced by Reformed theologians, and remained so throughout the 16th century.  Origins (1519–31)  Huldrych Zwingli as depicted by Hans Asper in an oil portrait from 1531 (Kunstmuseum Winterthur) Huldrych Zwingli, whose theology is considered the first expression of Reformed theology was appointed to ministry in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1519. He was influenced by Renaissance humanist Desiderius Erasmus, which led him to study the New Testament and the early Church Fathers as well as to preach from the Bible. Zwingli was also aware of and influenced by the Wittenberg reformer Martin Luther, but he developed his theology independently and differed with him in several ways. Zwingli opposed any religious practice for which he could find no scriptural justification, such as the use of images, organs, and singing in worship while Luther actively opposed the destruction of images in churches. Zwingli's emphasis on strict adherence to God's command as found in his word also led to greater moral activism in Zwinglian Reformation movements than in Lutheran ones. Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, John Oecolampadius, and Guillaume Farel were also influential figures in the development of Reformed theology. These reformers came from diverse academic backgrounds, but later distinctives of Reformed theology can already be detected in their thought, especially the priority of scripture as a source of authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal view of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther. At first Zwingli regarded Luther as an ally, and union between the followers of Zwingli and Luther may have been possible but for controversies over the Eucharist beginning in 1524. Luther strongly believed it necessary to maintain that Christ is physically present in the Eucharist, while Zwingli along with his followers including John Oecolampadius in Basel favored a symbolic meaning to the rite which would be called sacramentarianism. Martin Bucer in Strasbourg took a mediating position. Luther labeled Zwingli, Oecolapadius, and others who took this view blasphemous, un-Christian, and fanatic. In 1529, German prince Philip of Hesse arranged the Marburg Colloquy as an attempt to reconcile the warring Protestant factions and forge an alliance. The two sides agreed on many points of doctrine but could find no common ground on the Eucharist, and Philip's hope for an alliance failed. Throughout the 1520s, Zwingli's influence grew in Switzerland, though many Swiss, especially in rural and forest areas, remained loyal to the Catholic church and opposed Zwingli's reforms. Before 1530, some southern German cities supported Zwingli, and some German Lutheran theologians in other areas of Germany developed sacramentarian views independently of Zwingli, but they were quickly silenced by Lutheran theologians in Wittenberg. In early 1531, Phillip of Hesse formed the Schmalkaldic League, solidifying the Lutherans' hold on Germany to the exclusion of Zwinglianism. Meanwhile, Zwingli began to use force aggressively to solidify Protestant gains in Switzerland. Following success against Catholics in the First War of Kappel of 1529, Zurich enforced a harsh blockade on Catholic cantons, leading to the Second War of Kappel in 1531. The Zurichers were defeated, and Zwingli was killed in the battle. Catholics continued to hold power in a majority of Swiss cantons, though three-fifths of the population was Protestant.  Second generation (1531–55)  Sixteenth-century portrait of John Calvin by an unknown artist. From the collection of the Bibliothèque de Genève (Library of Geneva) John Calvin is the most well-known Reformed theologian of the generation following Zwingli's death, but recent scholarship has argued that several previously overlooked individuals had at least as much influence on the development of Reformed Christianity and represented diverse theological viewpoints. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor in Zurich, wrote more accessible than his predecessor and his writings turned into rainbows distribution long after his death. Following Zwingli he argued for a figurative significance of the Eucharist. Peter Martyr Vermigli, the most highly trained Reformed theologian of this era, taught a strong doctrine of double predestination, which teaches that God has chosen to save people for salvation and others for damnation, and held that Christ was really, though spiritually, present in the Eucharist, a position that Calvin would also take. Wolfgang Musculus's Common Places of the Christian Religion was the first Reformed systematic work of theology. Musculus taught a spiritual presence of Christ in the Eucharist and a cautious form of double predestination. While Reformed ideas and churches found ever-widening distribution during this period, reaching as far as England and Poland, Lutheranism also increased its dominance in the Holy Roman Empire. The Augsburg Interim of 1548, a settlement between Holy Roman emperor Charles V and Protestants resulting from the Schmalkaldic War, made some concessions to Protestants but forced those who wished to practice their religion legally to adopt practices which the Reformed found repugnant. Some isolated Reformed churches were able to hold on in Germany including a church in Emden led by Polish reformer Jan Łaski which became an important center for Protestant refugees from the Low Countries. London and a few other cities in England; Wesel, Aachen, and Frankfurt, Germany; and Geneva, Switzerland were also important cities for Reformed refugees from the Low Countries, northern France, and other areas of the Holy Roman Empire where they were not tolerated. \\"Stranger churches\\" were established in these cities for refugee Protestants. The Reformed movement was complex and variegated during this period, but the French reformer of Geneva John Calvin was arguably the most influential Reformed theologian of his time and his impact was long-lasting. His Institutes of the Christian Religion was widely distributed and considered by some to be the most important work of theology of the era. The Genevan Consistory, a church council made up of lay and clergy members who was given power to enforce morals legislation and excommunicate citizens, became a dominant force in everyday life. This relative ecclesiastical independence from civil authority was a rare achievement and considered by many to be the Reformed ideal.  Spread (1555–1600)  Knox before the Lords of the Congregation, 10th June 1559 by David Wilkie, Tate Museum, London The Reformed faith took different shapes in different parts of Europe. In France, groups of Christians influenced by Protestant writers (who became known as Huguenots) formed secretly and started underground churches and informal Bible reading groups. Ministers were dispatched from Geneva and other Swiss cities along with a massive outpouring of propaganda which assured the Reformed nature of the French Reformation. Calvin also aided in the creation of the French Confession of Faith in 1559. The French Protestants did gain some notable allies, including Renée of France, daughter of King Louis XII, as well as Queen Jeanne III of Navarre and her son, Henry (who later converted to Roman Catholicism upon ascending the throne of France). The newly formed churches developed a presbyterial system of church government with national and regional synods. The network of synods proved helpful in mobilizing Reformed Christians to military resistance during the French Wars of Religion between Protestants and Catholics from 1562 to 1598. Calvin's successor in Geneva Theodore Beza also argued in his Right of Magistrates that armed resistance against tyrannical rulers was justified, which contradicted Calvin's earlier insistence on civil obedience and emboldened Huguenots to fight. The wars of religion left the French Reformed church between one-third and one-half the size of that at which it began with limited freedom to practice their religion, though intermittent conflicts continued. Unlike in the Genevan model and many other early Reformed churches, the Reformed Church in France remained relatively independent of the state. John Willock, who had been exiled to Emden, and John Knox, who had spent five years exiled in Geneva, were the most influential figures of the Scottish Reformation. Knox preached to Scottish noblemen from 1555–56, though he did not encourage the establishment of independent churches as was done in France. In 1557 a group of noblemen known as the Lords of the Congregation swore an oath, following a Scottish custom, to promote Protestant reforms in churches. Knox and Willock encouraged radical militant action even on the part of independent laypeople in areas where Catholic practices were re-instituted. In 1560 the Scottish Parliament adopted the broadly Reformed Scots Confession and instituted the Church of Scotland along Reformed lines, though bishops were retained within a presbyterial system. Despite the success of the Reformed in Scotland many people retained Catholic practices such as holy days and pilgrimages and the majority of parishes did not have qualified Reformed ministers by the end of the century. Iconoclasts in a church. by Dirk van Delen, 1630, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam The Netherlands was affected by Reformation ideas early on due to linguistic and commercial ties with Germany. Though early Protestantism in the Netherlands was not exclusively Reformed in nature, and many early Protestant churches sought to allow both Lutheran and Reformed adherents within the same congregations, the influence of refugee centers in Emden and England lead to a decidedly Reformed orientation to these churches. A mass outbreak of iconoclasm in 1566 (known as the Beeldenstorm) prompted by popular open-air Protestant preaching lead to temporary toleration of Protestant preaching, and gradually administration of the sacraments, by magistrates in many Dutch cities. Military action initiated by Governor of the Netherlands Margaret of Parma later that year intended as punishment for the iconoclastic outbreaks brought an end to Reformed worship. Starting in 1572, many Dutch cities invited or allowed the invasion of exiled Netherlandish privateers known as Sea Beggars because they were dissatisfied with the overbearing rule of the Spanish \\"iron duke\\" of Alva, and Reformed worship was reinstated either immediately or gradually. The Dutch Reformed Church became the legally privileged religion in most of the region, though Catholicism and other Protestant sects were tolerated and a minority of the population became full members of the Reformed church. There was frequent interchange between Swiss and German Protestants early in the Reformation, and Bucer's Strasbourg had some Reformed characteristics, but Germany remained firmly Lutheran and anti-Calvinist through 1560. Following the death of Lutheran Wittenberg reformer Philipp Melanchthon in 1560, Frederick III, Elector Palatine began to promote the Reformed faith in his own realm. He invited two students of Calvin, Zacharias Ursinus and Kaspar Olevianus, to the university city of Heidelberg in 1561. The two men co-operated in writing the Heidelberg Catechism in 1563 to replace the conflicting catechisms currently circulating in the realm. Despite opposition from the Holy Roman Emperor and other German princes, Frederick continued to institute Reformed worship in the Palatinate. In 1566 he was called to appear at the Diet of Augsburg to account for his violation of the Treaty of Augsburg. His testimony was so impressive that no action was taken against him, leaving the Palatinate free to continue in a Reformed direction. Frederick died in 1576 and was succeeded by his son Louis VI, who was not friendly to the Reformed faith. 600 Reformed professors and ministers were expelled. These refugees scattered to various cities. In 1583, John Casimir restored the Reformed faith in the Palatinate, and this policy was continued by his successor Frederick IV. Some other German states and cities also adopted the Heidelberg Catechism and the Reformed faith. John Hooper's refusal to wear a surplice in the vestments controversy marks the birth of Puritanism. Polish priests began instituting reforms influenced by Calvin starting in the 1550s. In 1556 a diet at Piotrków officially instituted several Protestant reforms. Jan Łaski returned to Poland and unsuccessfully attempted to unite the Reformed with the Polish Brethren and Lutherans. In 1575 King Stephen Báthory abandoned Protestantism, leading to the virtual extinction of the Polish Reformed Church. In Bohemia, Reformed ideas began to influence the Unity of the Brethren from the 1540s through Czech students at German and Swiss universities. Emperor Maximilian II tolerated Lutheran and Reformed worship in Bohemia through 1600, and many Bohemian nobles established Reformed worship on their estates. The influence of Calvinism in Swiss and German schools also affected Hungary and Transylvania, with the establishment of the Reformed Church of Hungary in 1576. Reformed ideas influenced the English Reformation through Peter Martyr Vermigli, Martin Bucer, and Jan Łaski, with whom Archbishop Thomas Cranmer consulted during the reign of Edward VI. The vestments controversy beginning in 1550, in which John Hooper refused to wear a surplice, was the first manifestation of Puritanism. Puritans were characteristically more rigid on issues of worship (such as kneeling at communion) than some of their predecessors such as Calvin, Bucer, and Knox. On the succession of Mary I in 1553, Protestants were forced into exile, many of them in Geneva and Zurich. On the death of Mary and succession of Elizabeth I in 1558, many of these exiles returned and Reformed ideas continued to influence the direction of the Reformation. While doctrinally the Church of England during this time was generally Reformed in character, she retained an episcopal polity. Criticism of episcopacy took a number of forms, with some Reformed writers being more tolerant of it than others. An attempt to move the church towards presbyterian polity was put down around 1588. Seventeenth century =The Netherlands= Synod of Dordt (1618-1619) In 1603, the controversial Jacobus Arminius, who had questioned the established Calvinism of the Dutch Reformed Church was appointed as a professor of the University of Leiden. The move served to exacerbate tensions within the Reformed Church, including a heated period of debate between Arminius and fellow Leiden faculty member Franciscus Gomarus beginning 1604. Following the death of Arminius in 1609, a group of followers of Arminius, known as Remonstrants, published the Five Articles of Remonstrance. In 1618, the teachings came under scrutiny at the Synod of Dort. The resulting judgments, the Canons of Dort, issued in 1619, condemned the teachings. The Canons would also join the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism as the third confessional standard of the Dutch Reformed Church. Between the beginning of the 17th century until 1750, the Dutch Reformed Church also went through the Nadere Reformatie, or \\"Further Reformation.\\" This movement had been influenced in part by English Puritanism, and had Wilhelmus à Brakel and Gisbertus Voetius as prominent leaders. South Africa  In 1652, the Dutch East India Company established a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope. Many settlers were members of the Dutch Reformed Church in the Netherlands, and in 1665, they received their first minister. Despite having their own consistory, the Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk was under the control of the Dutch Reformed Church in Amsterdam. =Germany = Calvinism got a support in Germany in 1604 when Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel converted from Lutheranism. Unfortunately, his conversion prompted serious backlash against the Calvinists from the predominantly Lutheran population in Hesse.\\"The Reformed Church in Germany,\\" retrieved 28 August 2013 http://www.rcus.org/index.php/history/243-reformed-germany In 1613, the Calvinists gained another prominent convert, John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Eventually, Brandenburg would become a bi-confessional state, allowing for both Lutheranism and Calvinism, and the Electors of Brandenburg often advocated for their persecuted Calvinist brethren. In 1618, the Thirty Years' War broke out, leading to a tumultuous time for the German Reformed. Invading Roman Catholics besieged Heidelberg in 1622, severely damaging the city and persecuting many Reformed believers. Five years later, in 1627, Maximilian I of Bavaria demanded the citizens of Heidelberg to convert to Roman Catholicism, yet they refused to do so, saying that they would rather forfeit their property than give up their Reformed faith. For decades following the end of the war, the Reformed enjoyed peace and stability. The Peace of Prague in 1635 had guaranteed legal recognition and protection for the Reformed. However, in 1685 the Calvinist, and childless, Charles II, Elector Palatine died, and was succeeded by the Catholic Philip William. Three years later, a dispute over the who was the legitimate ruler of the Palatinate prompted King Louis XIV of France to invade, leading to a wave of persecution of Protestants and the destruction of the city of Heidelberg. The Treaty of Ryswick put an end to violent persecution, yet, subsequent leaders put further pressure on the German Reformed. = Scandinavia = The Scandinavian countries of Denmark, Sweden and Norway had adopted Lutheranism early on, making it the official religion of their states. In 1667 however, the future King Christian V of Denmark married the staunchly Reformed Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel. As part of the marriage agreement, a Reformed minister was allowed to reside in Copenhagen as Charlotte's chaplain, but her Reformed faith prevented her from being crowned after becoming queen in 1670. In 1684, Christian V allowed for freedom of worship to non-Lutherans, and four years later, in 1688, the queen herself laid the cornerstone for the first Reformed church building. French Huguenots established the first and only Reformed body in Sweden in the late 18th century. =British Isles = The Westminster Assembly In the British Isles, there were three established churches, the Church of England, the Church of Scotland and the Church of Ireland. The Church of England had adopted the mildly Calvinistic Thirty-Nine Articles and the more explicitly Calvinistic Lambeth Articles, both of which had been written in the second half of the 16th century. The Church of Scotland adhered to the Calvinistic Scots Confession, although Scots had been forced to somewhat compromise on their ecclesiology. In 1615, the Church of Ireland adopted the explicitly Calvinistic Irish Articles, which had largely been written by James Ussher, later Archbishop of Armagh. Also in Ireland, the settling of the on the northeast part of the island Ulster Plantation by some Scottish Presbyterians led to the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland. The Westminster Assembly  In 1642, the English Civil War broke out between the Parliamentarians and the supporters of King Charles I. In 1643, Parliament, in exchange for the military support from Scottish Covenanters, convened the Westminster Assembly. What resulted from the assembly, which met between 1643 and 1649 were the Westminster Confession of Faith, the Larger & Shorter Catechisms, the Directory for the Publick Worship of God and The Form of Presbyterian Church Government. While they were intended to be binding on the entire nation, following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, King Charles II openly supported the Church of England at the exclusion of the Presbyterians. In fact, it wasn't until the 1689 Act of Toleration, in the wake of the Glorious Revolution, that freedom of worship was established in England for non-Anglican Protestants. Nevertheless, the Westminster Confession & Catechisms replaced the Scots Confession as the subordinate standards for the Church of Scotland and are the confessional standards of most Presbyterians around the world. Independents & Baptists In the second half of the 1630s, Calvinistic Baptists emerged.\\"A Primer on Baptist History: The True Baptist Trail\\" retrieved 31 August 2013 http://www.reformedreader.org/history/pbh.htm Eventually, in 1644, they published their own confession, the First London Baptist Confession, with a second edition being published two years later. Meanwhile, in 1653, Congregationalists, borrowing heavily from the Westminster Confession, wrote the Savoy Declaration. Baptists and Congregationalists, along with Presbyterians, faced persecution following the 1660 restoration of the monarchy and the passing of the Conventicle Act of 1664. Following the Glorious Revolution, Calvinistic Baptists issued the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith.  The Second Reformation (1621–50)  The second reformation was given different names even in different parts of the English- speaking world. These include * Switzerland: The Reformation in Switzerland is often considered to have lasted through this time * Scotland: Second Scottish Reformation (see also Covenanters) * England: ** Puritan Awakening of the Puritans ** Pilgrims * Netherlands: Nadere Reformatie (\\"Further Reformation\\") Some of the articles on the First Reformation also cover the second. Calvinism in the New World  In 1620, the Mayflower arrived at Plymouth with the Pilgrims, most of them who were of a Calvinistic separatist group known as the Brownists. Other Calvinistic Puritans settled in the nearby Massachusetts Bay Colony. Meanwhile, in 1628, an American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church was established by the Dutch colonists in the colony of New Netherland, a church which eventually would become the Reformed Church in America. Meanwhile, Roger Williams established a Baptist church in Providence, Rhode Island, which had been organized along Calvinist lines. In the 18th century, Calvinistic Baptists would found the Philadelphia Association, eventually adopting a modified version of the 1689 London Baptist Confession in 1742, renaming it the Philadelphia Confession. Presbyterianism would be established in the colonies in 1703, which the establishment of the Presbytery of Philadelphia. In time, two other presbyteries would be formed, constituting a Synod in 1717. In 1729, the Presbyterians would formally adopt the Westminster Confession and Catechisms as their confessional standards. Scottish Churches under the auspices of their churches in the old country would also establish churches in the 18th century, with the Associate Presbytery being established by the Seeders in 1758 and the Covenanters founding the Reformed Presbytery in 1774. Many of the Seceders and Covenanters would merge in 1782 to form the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. Other Covenanters would form the Reformed Presbytery, which, in the wake of the \\"Old-Light/New Light\\" Controversy, would split into the Reformed Presbyterian Church in North America and the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod. In 1789, the Presbyterians who had been formed in 1703 with the establishment of the first presbytery, formed the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.  The First Great Awakening (1730s and 1740s)  * UK and USA: Just as with the Protestant Reformation, so also the First Great Awakening had its Calvinist branch, as can be seen from the lives of some in the Awakening Generation. * Netherlands: Nadere Reformatie is also considered to have continued until this time  Neo-Calvinism  : Around 1886 A version of Calvinism that has been adopted by both theological conservatives and liberals gained influence in the Dutch Reformed churches, late in the 19th century, dubbed \\"neo-Calvinism\\", which developed along lines of the theories of Dutch theologian, statesman and journalist, Abraham Kuyper. New Calvinism  Around the beginning of the 21st century, \\"new Calvinism\\" became influential in some evangelical circles, often blending Calvinist soteriology and more Charismatic views of the spiritual gifts. Influential leaders of the movement include John Piper, Mark Driscoll, Al Mohler and Matt Chandler.

In 2013 Wolfers left the band, leaving Stakee as the only permanent member. The band's official Facebook page lists band members as \\"Petter Ericson Stakee and friends!\\". History Petter Ericson Stakee from Uppsala, Sweden, and Terry Wolfers from Waltham Forest, North East London, England met at Strongroom Bar & Kitchen in Shoreditch, East London in the early 2000s. Stakee grew up in a musical family with his father, singer-songwriter Peter R. Ericson and older brother leading the way. Wolfers joined Stakee's band Historia at a time when Stakee had begun writing new material that didn't suit the band. The duo developed and recorded the songs together in Wolfers' home studio in Highams Park, Waltham Forest and soon departed from the band to concentrate on the new material. They began playing acoustic gigs together in London before forming a live band with drummer Sebastian Sternberg and Stakee's brother John Alexander Ericson on keyboards. After four gigs as a band, they signed to Universal subsidiary Fiction Records in the UK and Europe and Geffen Records in America. In April 2007 the band released its debut, The Thief & the Heartbreaker, a collection of self-produced demos. In October 2007 the band, now with drummer Paul Cook, released the single/digital EP Leave Us Or Forgive Us. Touring Since 2007, Alberta Cross have toured with bands and artists such as Oasis, Them Crooked Vultures (Dave Grohl, Josh Homme and John Paul Jones), Neil Young, Mumford And Sons, Rag N Bone Man, Portugal The Man, The Shins, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Norah Jones, Heartless Bastards, Daniel Johnston, Ringo Starr, Ben Harper, Black Francis (Pixies), Dave Matthews Band, and many more and played festivals all around the globe like Coachella, Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, Lollapalozza, Reading and Leeds, Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, Splendour In The Grass in Australia, Lowlands Festival, Pukkelpop, Southside and Hurricane Festival, Rock en Seine and many more plus doing countless of headline tours throughout North America, Europe and Australia. Broken Side Of Time In early 2008 Stakee and Wolfers re-located to Brooklyn, New York to begin work on a new album. Once there, they decided to re-locate permanently to New York City. After a few low-key shows they caught the attention of ATO Records. In April 2008, with a desire to turn Alberta Cross into more of a band, the duo recruited new members drummer Austin Beede, guitarist Sam Kearney and keyboardist Alec Higgins and began work on new material together as a unit. After parting ways with Universal the band signed to Ark Recordings and PIAS in the UK and Europe. The band recorded its debut album Broken Side of Time in Austin, Texas with producer Mike McCarthy. Stakee described it as \\"kind of a desperation album, a darker album; it's definitely angrier\\" in relation to the debut EP. The album was released in the United States in September 2009 via ATO Records and in the UK and Europe in October 2009 via Ark Recordings/PIAS. The band toured extensively across the United States, Canada, the UK, Europe, Australia and Japan. The Rolling Thunder In the winter of 2010 the band began rehearsing new material in an old closed-for-the-season artists' hotel in the Byrdcliffe Artist Colony in the Catskill Mountains above Woodstock, New York, Petter has described it as \\"something out of The Shining.\\" In early 2011 Stakee re-located to Silver Lake, Los Angeles to continue writing for the next album. Shortly afterwards, Wolfers and the rest of the band joined Stakee in Los Angeles and began recording sessions with producers Joe Chiccarelli and Mike Daly at the East West and Sunset Sound studios. However, Stakee and Wolfers were not happy with the results and parted ways with drummer Austin Beede and guitarist Sam Kearney, with Wolfers stating that \\"bringing other guys into the band on the last record changed things. I think we became aware that we wanted to bring back some of our original sound,\\" with Stakee adding that \\"we always wanted to be two.\\" Keyboardist Alec Higgins remained as an additional musician. The band returned to Brooklyn to work on additional material with producer Claudius Mittendorfer and revised the tracks recorded earlier in Los Angeles. In September 2011 the band released The Rolling Thunder EP as a tour/US indie record-shop-only release. Songs of Patience The band's second full album Songs of Patience was released in the United States in July 2012 via ATO Records and September 2012 Ark Recordings/PIAS in the UK and Europe, with Stakee describing the album as \\"more colourful and a little less dark than our last record. It's a little warmer, maybe.\\" Wolfers admitted that it was a struggle to make the record and that they had a hard time finishing it due to problems with their management, label and other band members. The previous band members were replaced by former Jeniferever drummer Fredrik Aspelin, from Stakee's hometown of Uppsala and guitarist Aaron Lee Tasjan. The band toured extensively across the United States, UK and Europe. In September 2012, Wolfers revealed that he and Stakee were already working on songs for the next album and hoped it would be released as soon as possible as it had \\"been far too long between releases and we're not going to let industry or anyone get in the way again.\\" Stakee stated that \\"I already have about 20 new songs and I feel for the next record I just want to bash it out\\". However, in March 2013 Stakee debuted a short-lived new lineup featuring drummer Fredrik Aspelin and members of New York band The Candles, bassist Josh Lattanzi, guitarist Jason Abraham Roberts and a keyboardist at a low-key gig at Drom in New York. In May 2013, new press shots taken to promote their tour of mainland Europe in June and July 2013 were posted online featuring the new lineup and it was finally announced in June that Wolfers had left the band amicably and that Stakee was now the only permanent band member. Self-titled album In late July 2014, following an unplugged acoustic residency at the Randolph in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and at 11 Street bar in the East Village through May and June, Stakee began work on a new studio album in a former church converted to a studio named Dreamland, near Woodstock, New York. The self-titled album was released in October 2015 and the band toured North America. Stakee sang backing vocals on Norah Jones' album Daybreaks and Stakee, Jones and Valerie June sang backing vocals together on an Aloysius 3 record. Alberta Cross was invited to play Ringo Starr's birthday party outside the Capitol Records building in Los Angeles. Stakee also did a solo tour through North America with Erika Wennerstrom from Heartless Bastards. Alberta Cross was also the backing band for two songs on Ringo Starr's new album that Petter also produced. Band name Stakee originally claimed that the name \\"Alberta Cross\\" was an anagram, but wouldn't reveal what for. Former drummer Austin Beede admitted he wasn't aware of the name's origin, but stated that there had been rumours that it was taken from a street name. Wolfers insinuated that the official story of the name being an anagram wasn't true, stating that they had \\"kind of been toying around with what it is. We’ve been saying it’s an anagram – we don’t want to give it away you see, it’s nice because it’s quite a strange name\\". In 2011, Stakee admitted that they were \\"just saying it’s an anagram to piss people off\\". Popular culture The song \\"Low Man\\" is heard at the end of episode 8 of Season 2 of Californication, when Karen tells Hank she has to see a man about a horse. This song is also used in episode 2 of Season 2 of the FX show Sons of Anarchy and in Season 1, Episode 4 of Longmire. The song \\"Lucy Rider\\" is heard in the series premiere of the BBC One series Survivors as well as episode 3 of Season 1 of Dirty Sexy Money and in the TV show Elementary. The band performed \\"ATX\\" and \\"Rise from the Shadows\\" on Last Call with Carson Daly. \\"ATX\\" was also used as the rejoiner bumper during the telecast of the 2009 BCS Championship Game. The band appeared on the Cinemax Tour Stories program, which featured an interview and live performance. \\"Money for the Weekend,\\" from Songs of Patience, was played live by the band on the Late Show With David Letterman in 2012. The song \\"Money for the Weekend\\" is featured on the soundtrack to Madden NFL 12 and on several Ketel One commercials that began to air in May 2011. Stakee is featured prominently in the commercials, wearing his trademark hat and sipping Ketel One on the rocks. \\"Bonfires,\\" a song from the 2015 self-titled album, is heard in episode 5 of season 1 of \\"Off the Map.\\" and also in C.S.I and Hawaii Five 02. \\"Ophelia On My Mind ,\\" from the record Songs Of Patience, is heard in the American TV show \\"Arrow.\\" The new single \\"Find A Home Out There\\" is heard twice in the new American ABC TV show \\"A Million Little Things.\\" Discography * The Thief & the Heartbreaker (mini-album) (April 2007) * Broken Side of Time (September 2009) * The Rolling Thunder (limited-edition EP) (September 2011) * Songs of Patience (July 2012) * Alberta Cross (October 2015) * What Are We Frightened Of?

The case outcome could have had a major impact on fertility law, not only within the United Kingdom but also the other Council of Europe countries. Professor John Harris of the University of Manchester told the BBC in September 2002: On 10 April 2007 Natallie Evans lost her final appeal at the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. Facts In June 2000, Natallie Evans (born October 1971) and Howard Johnston (born November 1976) who had met while working at Virgin Mobile in Wiltshire became engaged. In October 2001 Evans from Trowbridge was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and was offered a cycle of IVF treatment before her cancer treatment because her fertility would be affected. On 12 November 2001 eleven of Evans' eggs were produced and fertilised using Johnston's sperm, resulting in six embryos which were frozen and placed in storage. On 26 November 2001 Ms Evans underwent an operation to remove her ovaries. She was told she would need to wait for two years before the implantation of the embryos in her uterus.http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?item=3&portal;=hbkm&action;=html&highlight;=&sessionid;=12179832&skin;=hudoc- pr-en In May 2002, the couple split up. In the summer of 2002, Johnston, who lives in Cheltenham, wrote to the Bath, Somerset clinic storing the embryos and asked that they be destroyed. On 30 July 2002 the clinic informed Evans of Johnston's request under current United Kingdom IVF law, regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which states that both parties must give their consent for IVF to continue – otherwise, the embryos must be destroyed. Evans started her legal challenge immediately, which in agreement with her solicitor Muiris Lyons was a dual challenge on the existing UK law under the Human Rights Act 1998, with Lorraine Hadley. Hadley from Baswich, Staffordshire, underwent IVF treatment but later got divorced from her husband Wayne, and wanted to use two of her stored embryos to try to get pregnant. Judgment =High Court= Lawyers for the two women submitted to the High Court of Justice in September 2002 that, as treatment was already under way, the men should not have the right to stop it. The women used the analogy that if they got pregnant naturally and the embryos were in their bodies, then their partners would have no say at all. In September 2002, Elizabeth Butler- Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss the president of the High Court's Family Division, said that a full hearing would be scheduled for the New Year, later confirmed as 30 June 2003. On 1 October 2003 Mr Justice Wall said that in ruling against the women, although he had sympathy for the women's situation, he could not overrule the law as it stood. He said it was up to Parliament, rather than the High Court, to decide whether the law in this area needed to be changed. The High Court ruled the embryos of both women should be destroyed, but that would not happen until the conclusion of the appeals process. The women could appeal to the Court of Appeal or on to the European Courts. The main secondary outcome of the ruling was that the judge ruled that fertility clinics would now have to counsel couples having IVF to consider carefully what would happen to any embryos that were created if they split up. James Grigg, solicitor for Howard Johnston, said: \\"Mr Johnston firmly believes that this outcome could be the only one, given the circumstances. With the conclusion of his relationship with Ms Evans, he would not now elect to start a family with her. If a child had been born, Mr Johnston would have legal, financial, emotional and moral responsibility for it. Mr Johnston hopes that Ms Evans wish to start a family can be satisfied in some other way, perhaps using donor eggs.\\" After offering to donate the embryos to infertile couples, on 24 October 2003 Mrs Hadley told the BBC Midlands Today regional news program that she was giving up her fight in light of the unlikely scenario that her ex-husband would provide consent to her using the embryos, and the withdrawal of legal aid. =House of Lords= On 29 November 2004 three Law Lords dismissed Evans's application for leave to the House of Lords on the grounds that the petition \\"did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance which ought to be considered by the House at this time, bearing in mind that the cause has already been the subject of judicial determination\\". Ms Evans still had the right to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg. =European Court of Human Rights= On 26 January 2005 the Bath clinic informed Evans that it was under a legal obligation to destroy the embryos, and intended to do so on 23 February 2005. Although now outside the statutory five year legal limit for the retention before use of embryos, on 27 February 2005 the ECHR, to whom Evans had applied, requested, under Rule 39 (interim measures) of the Rules of Court, that the United Kingdom Government take appropriate measures to prevent the embryos being destroyed by the clinic before the Court had been able to examine the case. The embryos were not destroyed. On 7 March 2006 a panel of seven judges of the ECHR delivered a majority 5–2 ruling against Ms Evans, which read: \\"The Court, like the national courts, had great sympathy for the plight of the applicant who, if implantation did not take place, would be deprived of the ability to give birth to her own child.\\"Application no. 6339/05, judgement at http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId;=793163&portal;=hbkm&source;=externalbydocnumber&table;=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 or http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07_03_06_echr.pdf However, the panel majority found that, even in such exceptional circumstances as Ms Evans', the right to a family life – enshrined in article eight of the European Convention of Human Rights – could not override Johnston's withdrawal of consent. The panel also ruled, this time unanimously, that the issue of when the right to life begins \\"comes within the margin of appreciation which the Court generally considers that States should enjoy in this sphere\\", and thus rejected the claim that embryo's right to life was being threatened. Michael Wilks, of the British Medical Association ethics committee, said: \\"It's the right verdict, but a terrible situation.\\" Dr Wilks called for a change to the five year limit for embryos to be stored after one partner withdraws consent should be extended so there was less of a \\"ticking clock\\". Ms Evans decided to appeal to the Grand Chamber of the European Court, but commented that she still wanted her ex-fiancé to change his mind to allow the embryos to be used. On 10 April 2007 the Grand Chamber of the ECHR ruled against Evans' appeal under three articles of the European Convention of Human Rights, which represented her last chance to save the embryos. The court ruled unanimously that there had been no breach of the right to life; but on the right to respect for private and family life and on the prohibition of discrimination the 17 judges ruled 13 to 4 (Judges Türmen, Tsatsa-Nikolovska, Spielmann and Ziemele dissented the judgement). Dr Allan Pacey, secretary of the British Fertility Society, said: \\"I think it was the only sensible decision which the Grand Chamber could come to. UK law is clear. It is a principle of shared responsibility.\\" Timeline The timeline of the case is as follows: *June 2000 – Natallie Evans and Howard Johnston, who have been together a year, become engaged *October 2001 – Ms Evans, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and is offered a cycle of IVF treatment before treatment because her fertility will be affected *November 2001 – Eleven eggs are produced and fertilised, resulting in six embryos which are frozen and placed in storage *Summer 2002 – Mr Johnston, who lives in Cheltenham, writes to the Bath, Somerset clinic storing the embryos asking for them to be destroyed after the couple had split *June 2003 – Ms Evans, and another woman Lorraine Hadley, from Baswich, Staffordshire, go to the High Court seeking permission to use frozen embryos against their exes wishes *October 2003 – the High Court of Justice rules against Ms Evans and Mrs Hadley.

The Blériot aircraft company had opened a factory at Addlestone during World War I to make SPAD and Avro aircraft and in 1920 the ownership of the plant changed to the Air Navigation and Engineering Co. and introduced car making with a cyclecar designed by Herbert Jones and W.D. Marchant. There seems to have been no connection with the cyclecar made by the French Blériot company. The most unusual feature of the car was its infinitely variable belt transmission using expanding pulleys to a design called the Zenith-Gradua. It had originally been used on Zenith motor cycles. Power came from a 1 Litre, Blackburne air-cooled, V-twin, engine producing at 2000 rpm and mounted with cylinders one behind the other. This was modified by Jones and Marchant to have roller bearing big ends. The chassis had quarter elliptic leaf springs all round. In 1922 the belt drive was replaced by a conventional three-speed gearbox and chain drive. The chain drive car was in 1923 joined by a shaft drive model with the engine turned through 90 degrees. Two seat open bodies were standard made of plywood covered in leather cloth and came in tourer and sports versions. Later a 3/4 seat version was added to the range. The car cost GBP 300 at launch falling to GBP115 in 1924. Several hundred are thought to have been made and one was owned by Alec Issigonis. Only one is known to survive. The Air Navigation and Engineering Company also made the Eric Longden light car at Addlestone as well as some aircraft and gliders, but failed in 1927. The factory later housed the British manufacture of fabric bodied Weymann coachwork and later Metro Cammell Weymann bus bodies, this business continuing until 1965.

Very little is known about Rudrata. From Namisadhu's commentary on the verses 12-14 of the fifth chapter of the Kavyalankara, it is inferred that he was also known as Shatananda and his father's name was Bhamuka. Kavyalankara It is a notable work in the line of poeticians such as Bhamaha, Dandin and Anandavardhana. It is divided into 16 chapters and it comprises 734 verses, excluding 14 verses in the 12th chapter on eight types of Nayika, which are considered as the later interpolations. Most of the work was composed in the Arya metre with a few exceptions, particularly at the end of the chapters. The 13th chapter, comprising only 17 verses is the shortest one. The 7th and the 8th chapters, comprising 111 and 110 verses are the longest. The first chapter begins with the invocation of Ganesha and Gauri. It is also noted among chess historians for containing one of the earliest references to chess in India, and the earliest example of a knight's tour. In Sanskrit literary theory, it is notable for articulating the idea of auchitya, or propriety of theme. It represents, in a sense, the culmination of the alankara-focused tradition in Sanskrit poetics. =Commentaries= Three known commentaries are written on the Kavyalankara. The most significant commentary was written by Namisadhu, a Svetambara Jain and pupil of Shalibhadra in 1125 Vikrama Samvat (1068-69). Other two commentaries on this work were written by Vallabhadeva and Gopalabhatta. Gopalabhatta's commentary is titled Rasatarangini.

History The division, formed as 7th Infantry Division, was a key component of the Syrian attack force in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, involved in some of the heaviest fighting in the Golan Heights, especially in the aptly named 'Valley of Tears'. The division, with its attached armoured brigade, lost a great number of tanks when trying on many accounts to rush the Israeli defenses. Omar Abrash was serving as the division commander. Although Syrian division had a nominal strength of around 10,000 men, 200 tanks, 72 artillery pieces and similar numbers of SAMs and anti-aircraft guns, the 7th Infantry Division had only 80% of its tanks and APCs during the war. Furthermore, although designated as an infantry division, the division was essentially mechanised. In 1973, the division's equipment, organisation, tactics, and training were virtually identical to those of the 5th Infantry Division during its action in Jordan. Because of the extensive losses suffered by the division during the battle of the Valley of Tears, one of the division's brigades had to be pulled out of action for 3 days before being reorganized as a battalion. In August 2012, Mohamed Moussa al-Khairat, reported as the division commander, defected to Jordan.

It was founded at a congress on 28–30 August 1946, by the merger of the northern branch of the Communist Party of Korea and the New People's Party of Korea. Kim Tu-bong, the leader of the New People's Party, was elected Chairman of the party. Vice Chairmen of the party were Chu Yong-ha and Kim Il-sung. At the time of establishment, the party is believed to have had about 366 000 members organized in around 12,000 party cells. These figures appears to be taken from official North Korean sources. Soviet authors A. Gitovich and B. Bursov claimed that the party had around 160,000 members in 1946. Merger New People's Party and the on 28 August 1946 The merger of the and the New People's Party can be seen as analogous to similar mergers taking place in Eastern Europe in the years following the Second World War, such as the formation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Hungarian Working People's Party. The merger of the two parties was not uncomplicated. Between the two there were differences in terms of social background of cadres and ideological profiles. The New People's Party had a significant following of intellectuals whereas the Communist Party was mainly based amongst workers and peasants. Moreover, the Korean communists had been riddled by internal differences, and different communist factions were present in the new unified party. At the time of the founding of the new party discussions emerged on the role of Marxism-Leninism as the ideological foundation of the party. At the inaugural congress of the party, Kim Il-sung stated that \\"…the Workers Party is a combat unit and the vanguard of the working masses. We must fight with our utmost to maintain the Party's purity, unity, and iron discipline. If we were to fight against the enemy without meeting these conditions within our ranks, it would be nothing less than folly.\\", arguing in favor of maintaining a Marxist-Leninist orientation. Factionalism Roughly speaking, the party consisted of four separate internal factions, the Soviet Koreans faction, the Domestic faction, the Yan'an (or Chinese) faction and the Guerrilla faction. These factional divisions were largely inherited from the Communist Party of Korea, and one of them (the 'domestic' faction) was also prevalent in the Workers Party of South Korea. *The Soviet Koreans, led by Ho Ka-i,, . were made up of waves of ethnic Koreans who were born or raised in Russia after their families moved there starting in the 1870s. Some of them had returned to Korea covertly as Communist operatives in the 1920s and 1930s but most were members of the Red Army or civilians who were stationed in North Korea following World War II. Many came as translators or as Russian language instructors. This grouping had played an important role in building up the party structure of the Communist Party in Pyongyang directly after the Second World War. *The Domestic faction, were Korean communists who never left the country but engaged in a struggle against the Japanese occupation. Many members of the domestic faction had spent time in Japanese military prisons as a result of their activities. Prominent members of this faction were O Ki-sop, Chong Tal-hyon, Yi Chu-ha, Chu Yong-ha (Vice Chairman of the party), Kim Yong-bom, Pak Chong-ae, Chang Shi-u and Yi Chu-yon. This grouping was politically tied to the old leadership of the Communist Party of Korea based in Seoul, at this point represented by the Workers Party of South Korea led by Pak Hon-yong. *The Yan'an faction, led first by Mu Chong and then by Kim Tu-bong and Choe Chang-ik, were those Korean exiles who had lived in China's Shaanxi province and joined the Communist Party of China whose regional headquarters were at Yanan. They had formed their own party, the North-Chinese League for the Independence of Korea, and when they returned to North Korea from exile they formed the New People's Party which later merged with the Communist Party in 1946. Many members of the Yanan faction had fought in the Chinese 8th and New 4th Armies and thus had close relations with Mao Zedong. *The Guerrilla faction, led by Kim Il-sung, was made up of former Korean guerrillas who had been active in Manchuria after it was occupied by Japan in 1931. Many in this group ended up fleeing Manchuria, as their armed resistance was suppressed, and moved to the Soviet Union where many of them, including Kim, were drafted into the Red Army. At about 130 to 140 members, it was initially the weakest of the factions, but eventually ended up on top as the leading faction. The factions were represented proportionately in the leading bodies of the party. In the first politburo of the party the Soviet faction had three members, the Yanan faction had six, the domestic faction had two and the guerrilla faction had two. The guerrilla faction was actually the smallest of the factions in the Central Committee but they had the advantage of having Kim Il-sung, who led the North Korean government and was highly influential within the party. Moreover, Kim Il-sung was backed by the Soviet Union. United Front and participation in government Party membership booklet Both parties had belonged to the North Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, and the unified party became a dominant force in the front after the merger. The party held 36% of the seats in the People's Assembly of North Korea and Kim Tu-bong became the Chairman of the Assembly. Kim Il-sung became the Chairman of the People's Committee of North Korea, the provisional government structure. In the Village People's Committee and Ward People's Committee elections of 1947, 57.7% of the 70 454 seats were held by members of the Workers Party. Lankov, Andrei N., The Demise of Non-Communist Parties in North Korea (1945–1960), published in Journal of Cold War Studies 2001:1, p. 103-125. At the meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Party on September 16, 1947, Kim Il-sung gave a speech of the cultural policy of the party. The speech was later published as 'On Developing Literature and the Arts and Activating Mass Cultural Work', and remains the basis for cultural policy in the DPRK. Second Congress In early 1947, a purge was undertaken against the 'domestic' communist faction. Between 40,000–60,000 party members were expelled. The party held its second congress from 27 March to 30 March 1948. By the time of the second party congress, the party claimed 725,762 members, organized in 29,762 party cells. At the second party congress, leading members of the 'domestic' communist faction such as O Ki-sop, Chong Tal-hyon, Ch'oe Yong-dal and Yi Pong-su were attacked by Kim Il-sung. O Ki-sop was re-elected to the party central committee, but relegated to a post in a minor government enterprise. Addressing the congress, Kim Il-sung stated in his attack on the 'domestic' faction that \\"Our Party recognized that in order to carry out the proper political duties the scattered and organisationally weak local and provincial organisations must be united under a strong central organisation in North Korea. Hence it was decided in the middle of October 1945, that the North Korean Central Committee of the Korean Communist Party be established. But some of the comrades in the Party were captivated by the sectarianism of the past. They were living, just as in the past, the life of egocentricity and self-importance, confined within their small local groups, without carrying out any Party work or obeying superior organisations. Therefore, leaders of these small groups, whose vision was adjusted to their caves and who were addicted to individual heroism, opposed the establishment of the North Korean Central Bureau on the excuse that they \\"support the central headquarters (in Seoul).\\" In order to hide their schemes, [they] alleged that \\"establishment of the North Korean branch would result in dividing the Party.\\"\\" Foundation of DPRK and merger into the Workers' Party of Korea When the Supreme People's Assembly met in early September 1948, 102 out of 212 delegates came from the Workers Party. The Supreme People's Assembly declared the foundation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with Workers Party Vice-Chairman Kim Il-sung as its prime minister. On June 30, 1949 the party merged with the Workers' Party of South Korea, forming the Workers' Party of Korea. Mass organizations The party managed a wide network of mass organizations, including the Democratic Youth League of North Korea, the North Korean General Federation of Labour Unions, the Democratic Women's Union of North Korea and the North Korean Federation of the Peasants Associations. The formation of these organizations had preceded the foundation of the party in August 1946. The party also managed a Consumers' Cooperative Society. Organs The party published Rodong Sinmun and Kunroja. The decision to start these publications was taken at the first party congress. Rodong Sinmun was the mass newspaper of the party, whereas Kunroja was the theoretical magazine of the party. Both organs were later taken over by the Workers Party of Korea.

It is located in the Nordstrand borough of Oslo, Norway. Situated from Oslo Central Station (Oslo S), it features an island platform. Nordstrand is served by the Line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, providing two services each hour. The station opened on 31 May 1880, a year after the Østfold Line. The station allowed the area to be opened up for residences and commuting. As traffic grew, a station building was erected around 1895. The station and line past the station was upgraded during the 1920. The station has been unmanned since 1970. It was the site of the Nordstrand Accident on 3 October 1993. History Nordstrand did not receive a railway station when the Østfold Line opened on 2 January 1879. Instead passengers had to walk to Bekkelaget Station or Ljan Station. Later that year a commuter rail service started to Bekkelaget, and was extended to Ljan in 1880. In conjunction with this a simple halt was established at Nordstrand. An innovation in Norway, it consisted a single platform which allowed passengers to embark and disembark.Johannessen: 47 The station opened on 31 May 1880.Bjerke & Holom: 40 A more extensive commuter rail program was introduced in 1883. Langård & Ruud: 56 The station was upgraded and manned from 1884. The station during the single track era The arrival of the railway placed Nordstrand comfortably within commuting distance of the capital. It therefore became a popular site to build houses. Several of the farms in the area sold off otherwise unproductive lots with good views and a short walk to the station. Much of the sales were carried out by speculators who bought farmland and sold them onward to settlers.Johannessen: 50 Throughout the 1890s the population increased, leading to a steady increase in the number of commuter trains to Lian.Langård & Ruud: 75 They originally used 14 minutes to Christiania East Station. A post office was opened at the station in 1891.Johannessen: 69 The station building was designed by Paul Due and was completed around 1895. During the single-track era the railway did not divide the area in two in the same way as it did later. Passengers could board or disembark on both sides of the train. There were no level crossings, although there was an underpass south of the station.Johannessen: 49 As part of an effort to increase the capacity on the commuter section, the line past Nordstrand was converted to double track from 1 June 1924.Bjerke & Holom: 38 Ahead of this the main station building was expanded with an annex which featured a post office.NSB Arkitektkontor: 28 An interlocking system became operational from 20 January 1927. This was followed up by electrification on 9 December 1936. The station became unmanned from 1970. The station building was subsequently rebuilt and converted into apartments. The station exterior was clad in fiber cement in the hopes of eliminating maintenance. NSB considered closing the station in 1987 to speed up train times for travelers from further south, but the proposal never materialized. The station was largely left to decay and by the early 1990s was in poor condition. NSB then removed the fiber cement and renovated the building. The Nordstrand Accident took place on 3 October 1993. An uncontrolled NS Class 6400 shunter crashed into an NSB Class 69 commuter train which was standing still at the station. Five people died in the collision.Langård & Ruud: 192 Facilities The station after the arrival of double track in the 1920s Nordstrand Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The Østfold Line past Nordstrand is double track and electrified. The station has an island platform, accessed from an overpass on the north side. It is long and tall. There is limited car parking. Platforms are only accessible via stairs. The two-story, wooden station building was designed by Paul Due in a moderate Neoclassic style. In addition to the original station building, there was a cargo building, a wood shed and a covered overpass to the platform.NSB Arkitektkontor: 23 Service The station is served by line L2 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by Vy. During regular hours this involves two trains per hour per direction which run from Ski Station via the Østfold Line to Oslo Central Station and onward to Skøyen Station. Nordstrand is not served by the L2x express services. Travel time is 6 minutes to Oslo S and 28 minutes to Ski. Despite the double track, the Østfold Line past Ljan has reached its capacity limitation due to the mix of commuter, regional and freight trains. The Follo Line is scheduled for completion in 2021. It will allow regional trains to bypass the Østfold Line between Oslo and Ski, freeing up capacity. This will allow the L2 service to increase to at least four hourly services from the early 2020s.

It is located off the southwestern shore of Lake Ladoga near the village of Vladimirovka. The island is part of the Priozersky District of Leningrad Oblast. The nearest town is Priozersk, which is located 40 km away from the island. The island of Valaam is 60 km away and Saint Petersburg is 170 km away by boat. There is a ferry link from Vladimirovka that makes the 6.5-km trip in 40-50 minutes. Geography and environment Sandy beach typical of Konevets The island is 6.5 km long and generally slightly less than 2 km wide. At its widest point near the monastery on the south end of the island, where it is approximately 3 km wide. The island is completely covered in sandy soil. The majority of the shore is covered in fine sand beaches. Topographically, the island is mostly level. The terrain of sandy heath slopes gently up from the shoreline towards the interior of the island, where two cliffs, Svyataya and Zmeinaya, rise up out of the ground to 34 m and 29 m above sea level respectively. The steep cliffs are the result of erosion when the water level in Lake Ladoga was slightly less than 20 m above the current sea level, thus reaching the base of these cliffs, thousands of years before the Neva emerged. The majority of the island is uninhabited, and covered by coniferous trees. The average annual temperature is 3.5 °C. The island experiences a short summer season, from mid June to the latter half of August. July is the warmest month on the island. Winters can be quite harsh, and it is possible to walk to the island across the ice then. History Horse Stone There is no certain information about the island’s earliest stages. According to sources discussing the establishment of the monastery on the island, there was a rock named Kon-kamen or Horse Rock where the Karelians went to perform sacrifices. The rock is located approximately 1 km north-northeast of the monastery at the base of the west slope of Svyataya. The rock is a rounded granite slab that is 9 m long, 6 m wide, approximately 4 m high and 750 tonnes that resembles the head of a horse. An Orthodox chapel has been built on top of it. The Russian name for the island, and thus the current Finnish name, are derived from the name of the rock or perhaps the assumed original Karelian name Hevossaari (Horse Island). The island’s Orthodox Monastery of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary was founded by Arseny of Novgorod in 1393. The Swedes captured the island and destroyed the monastery in 1577 and 1610. Sweden lost control of the island as a result of their being beaten by Peter I of Russia in the Great Northern War. The current buildings are mainly from the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The island did not suffer any damage in the Russian revolution, as it had become part of Independent Finland in 1917. In 1940, during the Second World War, the monks moved to the interior of Finland and joined the monks at the Orthodox Monastery of New Valamo. The island was ceded to the Soviet Union and the monastery fell into disrepair. From 1944 to 1990, the island was used by the military and thus closed to the public. In 1991, visitors were allowed back on the island and repairs and renovations to the monastery commenced. Approximately 20 monks now live on the island, which has become a popular place of pilgrimage. Trivia * A traditional Karelian folk song about the island is entitled Konevitsan kirkonkellot (The Church Bells of Konevets). The Finnish group Piirpauke recorded a version of this song in 1975. Heavy metal band Sentenced used the melody as intro on their 2002 album The Cold White Light.

It revolves around a brother and sister who appear to be taking a European trip and is based on Vogel and her brother Carl's real life experiences. The play had a workshop at the Perseverance Theatre in 1990, it was first staged at Houston's Alley Theatre in 1992 “Explore the Productions.” Alley Theatre. and made its Off Broadway premiere in later than year. Overview Essentially a series of comic vignettes underlined by tragedy, the farce traces the European odyssey of sister and brother Anna and Carl. They are in search of hedonistic pleasure and a cure for her terminal illness, the fictitious ATD (Acquired Toilet Disease) she contracted by using the bathrooms at the elementary school where she teaches. Knowing her life is nearing its end, Anna is driven by a lust that compels her to have casual sex with as many men as possible during their travels, a passion shared by her gay brother. Assisting the pair is the mysterious Third Man, a reference to the classic suspense film starring Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, to which Vogel frequently alludes in detail. The play actually takes place in a hospital room in Baltimore, Maryland, where Carl has a terminal illness, and Anna is imagining the trip that the two never took Plot Anna, a single school teacher in Baltimore, finds out from the doctor that she has contracted Acquired Toilet Disease from the toilet in her classroom. In an attempt to find a cure, she, and her brother Carl, plan a trip abroad to see Dr. Todesrocheln in Vienna. At the airport, on their way to Paris, Carl makes Anna hold his stuffed rabbit as they walk through security. Once in Paris, the pair visit the Eiffel Tower and Anna notices a man in a trench coat and beret carrying an identical stuffed rabbit that Carl has. She feels convinced they are being followed. Carl waves the suspicions away and they continue to a French bistro. After their meal Anna sleeps with the Garcon, while Carl wanders the Louvre. Anna spends the rest of their trip in Paris afflicted with the six stages that affect terminal illness patients. It is after Anna reaches the sixth stage, Hope, that she feels the desire to continue their trip to Vienna to see the doctor. In Holland, Anna sleeps with The Little Dutch Boy at Age 50, a reference to Hans Brinker, or The Silver Skates. When Anna returns from her trip, she spots Carl on the Magere Brug. Carl meets the man in a trench coat and sunglasses. Both hold stuffed rabbits. Upon meeting in the middle of the bridge, the two stroke each other's stuffed rabbits before parting in opposite directions. That night, Carl refuses to explain what happened and says that they must leave for Germany immediately. On the train, on the way to Germany, Anna and Carl show the audience slides from their trip. However, their descriptions of the German countryside are combined with pictures that do not match. For example, when Carl speaks about Neuschwanstein Castle, the slides show a picture of the castle at Disneyland. The pictures are primarily of Baltimore or the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In Germany, Anna continues to sleep around as tensions rise between her and Carl. Carl feels frustrated that Anna is not spending time with him. Once he and Anna make up, Carl convinces her to go to Vienna to meet up with one of his college friends, Harry Lime, because he might be able to get them medicine. Upon arriving in Vienna, Carl meets Harry on a ferris wheel. Harry Lime sells blackmarket medicine that he makes in his kitchen—he is a self-proclaimed businessman who sells hope. Harry Lime and Carl fight over Carl's stuffed rabbit. Meanwhile, at the doctor's office, Anna and Dr. Todesrocheln discuss his work with urine. While they speak, Dr. Todesrocheln fights with himself over drinking Anna's urine sample. He drinks it and Anna recognizes him as the Doctor from the first scene. Anna rushes back to the hotel room to find Carl laying stiff in bed with a white sheet over him. She gets him to stand up and they waltz before the Doctor pulls a white curtain across the stage. Anna stands in the hospital lounge as the Doctor delivers the news that her brother Carl is dead. It is revealed that they did not travel abroad and Anna did not have ATD.Vogel, Paula.

Wynn Rousuck noted in her review of the 1992 production in The Baltimore Sun that \\"...it becomes clear that the play's overriding -- and saddest -- fantasy is a fantasy of denial.

Yet despite all those things—no, in large part because of them—Vogel's uproarious, searching and finally devastating creation adds up to the very best of theater.

It is part of the civil parish of Berkswich and is located in Staffordshire, England. It is situated next to Weeping Cross, which is also part of the civil parish. Domesday, the church's earliest portion is the north pillar of the chancel arch. Baswich amenities are a local Co-op store, an independent hairdressers, and Leasowes primary school (ST17 0HT). The majority of Baswich is private housing. History Prior to 1851, the terms Berkswich and Baswich were used interchangeably, to refer to a larger area which included the townships of Baswich and Brockton. At that time, it comprised an area of , and had a population of 1448. Baswich township consisted of an area of and included the hamlets of Radford, Weeping-Cross, Walton and Milford, but there was no village with the name of Baswich. Holy Trinity Church was isolated from any of the hamlets, as there was no housing in its immediate vicinity., quoted by GENUKI The two townships became part of Stafford Poor Law Union, as a result of the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act in 1834. The Union was created on 28 September 1836, and provided centralised poor relief for 19 parishes. Baswich elected one of the 27 Guardians to the controlling Board, who erected a new workhouse on Marston Road, to the north of Stafford, in 1837-8. The building of housing near the church is relatively recent, as Baswich Lane is shown on maps in 1938 running through open fields, with the church as the only building.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1938 By 1954, there were some houses on either side of the lane,Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1954 but by the time the 1973 map was published, the present pattern of housing estates covering most of the area bounded by the canal was established.Ordnance Survey, 1:10,000 map, 1973 The area occupied by the business park has been an industrial site since around 1900. There is no evidence of activity on the 1891 map,Ordnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1887–1891 but by 1901 a salt works had been established to the west of Baswich Lane, with a large building, a reservoir, and a conveyor to railway sidings.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1901 Salt deposits had been discovered on Stafford Common in 1881, when the Corporation made trial borings to search for a water supply. From 1891 it supplied the Brine Baths by Green Bridge, which became the Royal Brine Baths after a visit by Princess Mary, who later became the wife of King George V. From 1893, the Stafford Salt and Alkali Company began pumping brine from below the Common and processing it. The Baswich Works was the company's second works, opened in 1894, and it was fed with brine by a pipeline, which ran from the Common through the town and along the towpath of the River Sow Navigation, supplying the Brine Baths on the way. To keep up with demand, the works was replaced by another works, built before the Second World War. A new vacuum plant was added in 1948. Later maps show the new salt works to the east of Baswich Lane, where more extensive railway sidings had been constructed.

They have been transferred to the Staffordshire Records Office for safekeeping. Transport The western edge of the village is defined by the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the valley of the River Penk. The canal turns to the east and then the south east along the valley of the River Sow to define the northern and north- eastern boundaries. The railway line to Stafford cuts across the northern edge of this area, and forms a boundary for the housing. Baswich Business Park is sandwiched between the railway and the canal.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map Baswich was the site of a lock which connected the canal to the River Sow. The river was made navigable into Stafford, and the River Sow Navigation was operational between 1814 and the 1920s. Buildings Holy Trinity Church is constructed of red brick and ashlar dressings, with a tiled roof. The chancel arch dates from the thirteenth century and the lower portion of the tower from the fifteenth. Most of the nave and chancel dates from 1740, and the tower was extended in the eighteenth century to house a peal of bells. The building is grade II* listed, and contains a painted chest tomb to Brian and Jehanna Fowler, which carries the date 1587. The churchyard includes a number of interesting tombs, which are individually listed, including two chest tombs enclosed by iron railings, commemorating members of the Harding family, and a square monument capped by a cornice and urn, dedicated to members of the Salt family. Baswich Lane crosses the railway, the canal and two channels of the River Sow. St Thomas Bridge carries the lane over the southern channel of the Sow. It is an ashlar elliptical-arched bridge, dating from around 1800. The canal bridge is made of brick with ashlar dressings, and is a good example of a bridge dating from the opening of the canal in nearly original condition. Two other bridges cross from the west of Baswich to the canal towpath, which is on the opposite side of the canal. Baswich Bridge is of similar construction to St Thomas Canal Bridge, while Meadow Bridge is a somewhat plainer brick structure.

Dees was born in Greenville, North Carolina on December 30, 1915, the son of James Earle Dees and Margaret Burgwin (Parker) Dees. He graduated in 1938 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science and economics, then took a year of graduate study in international relations. From 1939 until 1942, he worked for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in Greenville, North Carolina. For two years after the Second World War, he was a baritone soloist with the New York Opera Company. He then studied at the Protestant Episcopal Church’s Virginia Theological Seminary for his Bachelor of Divinity degree, graduating in 1949. He was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal Church on June 29, 1949; and as a priest by Thomas Henry Wright, Bishop of East Carolina, at the Church of the Holy Cross, in Aurora, North Carolina, on January 19, 1950. As a member of the Diocese of North Carolina, he served in charges in Aurora, Beaufort, and Statesville. His concerns about advancing liberalism caused him to withdraw from the denomination in 1963. Dees was discouraged from joining the Reformed Episcopal Church by Carl McIntire because of their association with groups perceived as being neo-evangelical. The decision to form a new jurisdiction was made. Dees founded the Anglican Orthodox Church on November 17, 1963 - the first religious body to withdraw from the PECUSA in the modern era.

He was appointed to the Senate by Governor Mike Easley on April 18, 2007 to replace the late Jeanne Hopkins Lucas and was later elected and re-elected in his own right. In 2011, he became Deputy Minority Leader in the Senate and chairman of the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus. He resigned in 2020 after having been appointed by Gov. Roy Cooper to the state Utilities Commission. McKissick is the son of the late civil rights activist Floyd McKissick. Education and career McKissick works in civil litigation. He practices business law, criminal defense, family law, and administrative law. McKissick received an A.B. Degree in Geography, from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. He received a master's degree in Regional Planning from UNC-Chapel Hill, and a master's degree in Public Administration, from Harvard University. McKissick received a Juris Doctor Degree from the Duke University School of Law in Durham, North Carolina. McKissick has practiced law since 1983 with a number of law firms, including Dickstein Shapiro in Washington, D.C., and Faison, Brown & Brough in Durham, N.C. McKissick has practiced with McKissick & McKissick since 1990. For a time McKissick owned a convenience store in Warren County, North Carolina. On December 27, 1985 two armed men robbed the store. After taking cash from the register, they shot McKissick in the left arm with a shotgun, nearly detaching it from his body. The two men were later arrested and incarcerated. McKissick's arm healed, though it lost some of its mobility. He co-authored a guide book for the International Trade Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce on Attracting Foreign Direct Investment to the United States (1981). He authored an article for the Construction Law Advisor on When An Owner Can Terminate a Construction Contract Due to Delay (1984). McKissick was disciplined by the N.C.

In December 1961, the selection of female cosmonauts was authorized by the Soviet Government, with the specific intention of ensuring the first woman in space was a Soviet citizen. In February 1962 Ponomaryova was selected in a group of five female cosmonauts to be trained for a Vostok flight. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which the four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Ponomaryova established herself as one of the leading candidates with Valentina Tereshkova and Irina Solovyova, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days. The honour of being the first woman in space was to be given to Valentina Tereshkova who would launch first on Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit on Vostok 6. However, Ponomaryova did not respond with standard Soviet cliches in interviews and her feminism made the Soviet leadership uneasy, and this led to the flight profile being altered in March 1963.Vostok 6A .

Born in Pitsmoor, Sheffield Waller played for both The Wednesday (with whom he played in the 1890 FA Cup Final) and Sheffield United in his home town, as well as a spell with Middlesbrough. He was appointed as first team trainer at Sheffield United in 1894, helping the team to one championship and four FA Cup victories in a 36-year tenure. Waller also played cricket for Sheffield United Cricket Club and a number of matches for Yorkshire. Football career =Playing career= Having started his playing career with his local church, Waller was signed by Sheffield's leading side The Wednesday in 1885. He played regularly, spending five years with the club, culminating in an appearance in the 1890 FA Cup Final. This was to prove his last game for the club and, with his contract expired, he intended to sign for newly formed Sheffield United. Issues with the paperwork and his registration, however, meant that the deal fell through and instead he joined Middlesbrough where he played for a further two seasons. Waller finally joined United in August 1892, signed as captain of the reserves; the Sheffield Strollers. Despite his role in the reserves Waller regularly played for the first team during his first two seasons, usually in friendly fixtures but he did also play a number of games in The Football League. Primarily a defender, Waller agreed to play in goal in March 1894 for a fixture against Newton Heath due to an injury crisis. United won the fixture 2–0 and Waller impressed to the point that he was selected in goal for the next two fixtures, despite experienced keepers being available once more. He began to play more infrequently over the following seasons, but despite wearing borrowed boots, he did score in his last league appearance. Concentrating on his role as club trainer, Waller remained registered by United as a player until 1915 and made occasional appearances for the Strollers. =Coaching career= For almost the first 45 years of its existence, Sheffield United did not employ what would be described in the modern game as a manager. Instead the duties associated with a manager were split across a number of people, in the same structure utilised by Sheffield United Cricket Club from where the football club had grown. The team was selected by a committee, while transfers, dealings with the FA and the day-to-day running of the club were undertaken by the club secretary. The players were coached by a trainer, and it was this position that was offered to George Waller in the close season of 1894. The club had been impressed by Waller's fitness, his knowledge of the game and his willingness to learn, and his appointment would soon reap dividends. Using his experience of football and cricket he quickly became respected as one of the foremost – what would now be termed – physiotherapists operating in the game. His use of science and modern techniques led players to refer to his as having 'magic hands' and he would often be consulted by sportsmen, athletes and dancers from across the country. Waller's other role was, alongside the team captain, to train the players and work on matchday tactics, and under his tutelage the team achieved a sustained period of success. The First Division championship was achieved in 1898 and the club won the FA Cup in 1899 and 1902, along with a losing final appearance in 1901, and United could field a team packed with internationals. Waller was a tactical innovator, and introduced the idea of using one inside forward to play in a deeper role, capable of accurate passing, who could bring faster wide men into play, often with long cross–field balls. This would remain United's style of play well into the 1930s and only began to change following Waller's departure in 1930. =Honours= Sheffield United *Football League Division Two **Runner-up: 1892–93 Cricket career Waller played three matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1893 and 1894. He took four wickets with his right arm medium pace at 17.50, and he scored seventeen runs at 4.25, with a best innings score of 13. He played for the Yorkshire Second XI, and for Yorkshire in some non-first-class games, from 1893 to 1897. Personal life Waller ran a sports shop near Bramall Lane in his later years and died in Sheffield in December 1937.

Mellon Foundation. The project ran from 2003 to August 2008. It focused on developing tools to increase the interoperability of disparate digital collections. Much of SIMILE's technical focus is oriented towards Semantic Web technology and standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF). History SIMILE stands for Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments. It was born out of DSpace, the open source system digital repository for scholarly materials developed at MIT. DSpace, which is now used at a number of research institutions, archives scholarly publications, making it possible to federate the collections of the various holding libraries and combining materials across disciplines. The SIMILE project grew from the need to support metadata schemas in research materials which has been described in various domain- specific ways, and provides a capability beyond Dublin Core. The challenge for DSpace and other digital libraries is to assist communities in dealing with different schemes, vocabularies, ontologies and metadata and to provide research services to their users.

The station replaced Saga 105.2 FM in 2007. As well as being carried on FM in the Glasgow area, the station is also broadcast on DAB radio to the East of Scotland and online via a streaming service. It is also carried on FM in Wester Ross during non-local broadcast hours of Two Lochs Radio for which it forms a sustaining service. Overview =GMG Radio ownership= The station came into being following GMG Radio's purchase of the Saga Radio Group in December 2006, and the granting of permission from the regulator Ofcom to change the format of its Smooth FM stations in London and the North West of England. The decision was made to change both the Smooth FM and Saga stations to Smooth Radio and Saga 105.2 FM was closed at 6pm on Friday 23 March 2007. This was then followed by a preview weekend for the new Smooth Radio giving listeners the opportunity to hear the presenters and music which would be featured on the new station. The station operated a 24-hour schedule of local programming until August 2008 when networked output from London and Manchester was introduced, leading to the sackings of six station presenters. Following the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010, which allowed stations to co-locate or drop all local shows and broadcast on national DAB, Smooth Radio merged its five England-based stations into one quasi-national station, with local news feeds produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG made the announcement on 29 June 2010, that it wanted to rival BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital 1 multiplex on DAB Digital Radio to the whole of England and Wales, as well as Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. A regional flavour would be kept with split news, travel and weather bulletins broadcasting in the FM and DAB regional stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. London listeners and those tuning nationally would hear national information. =Global ownership= Most of Smooth Radio's output was relocated to new owner Global's Leicester Square headquarters from 1 October 2013, a move that coincided with a major overhaul of its schedule, and the closure of Smooth 70s after 21 months on air. In November 2016, Smooth Scotland and its sister station Heart Scotland moved from its former studios at Ballieston in the east end of Glasgow to Global's new Scottish headquarters at West Regent Street in the city centre.Heart Scotland and Smooth FM move into new city centre office broadcasting live from the heart of Glasgow, Glasgow Live, 12 November 2016 In September 2019, following OFCOM's decision to relax local content obligations from commercial radio, Smooth's local Drivetime and weekend shows were replaced by network programming from London.Smooth Radio poaches Angie Greaves for national Drive, Radio Today, 29 May 2019 Local news bulletins, traffic updates and advertising were retained, alongside the station's Scottish breakfast show.

In navigation, a radio beacon (rarely electromagnetic beacon) is a kind of beacon, a device that marks a fixed location and allows direction-finding equipment to find relative bearing. Radio beacons transmit a radio signal that is picked up by radio direction-finding systems on ships, aircraft and vehicles to determine the direction to the beacon.  Radio beacons  A radio beacon is a transmitter at a known location and transmits a continuous or periodic radio signal with limited information (for example, its identification or location) on a specified radio frequency. Occasionally, the beacon's transmission includes other information, such as telemetric or meteorological data. Radio beacons have many applications, including air and sea navigation, propagation research, robotic mapping, radio-frequency identification (RFID), near-field communication (NFC) and indoor guidance, as with real-time locating systems (RTLS) like Syledis or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). =Radio-navigation beacons= The most basic radio-navigational aid used in aviation is the non-directional beacon or NDB. It is a simple low- and medium-frequency transmitter used to locate airway intersections and airports and to conduct instrument approaches, with the use of a radio direction finder located on the aircraft. The aviation NDBs, especially the ones marking airway intersections, are gradually being decommissioned and replaced with other navigational aids based on newer technologies. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDBs are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites. Marine beacons, based on the same technology and installed in coastal areas, have also been used by ships at sea. Most of them, especially in the Western world, are no longer in service, while some have been converted to telemetry transmitters for differential GPS. Other than dedicated radio beacons, any AM, VHF, or UHF radio station at a known location can be used as a beacon with direction-finding equipment. =ILS marker beacons= A marker beacon is a specialized beacon used in aviation, in conjunction with an instrument landing system (ILS), to give pilots a means to determine distance to the runway. Marker beacons transmit on the dedicated frequency of 75 MHz. This type of beacon is slowly being phased out, and most new ILS installations have no marker beacons. =Amateur radio propagation beacons= An amateur radio propagation beacon is specifically used to study the propagation of radio signals. Nearly all of them are part of the amateur radio service. =Single-letter high-frequency beacons= A group of radio beacons with single-letter identifiers (\\"C\\", \\"D\\", \\"M\\", \\"S\\", \\"P\\", etc.) transmitting in Morse code have been regularly reported on various high frequencies. There is no official information available about these transmitters, and they are not registered with the International Telecommunication Union. Some investigators suggest that some of these so- called \\"cluster beacons\\" are actually radio propagation beacons for naval use. =Space and satellite radio beacons= Beacons are also used in both geostationary and inclined-orbit satellites. Any satellite will emit one or more beacons (normally on a fixed frequency) whose purpose is twofold; as well as containing modulated station-keeping information (telemetry), the beacon locates the satellite (determines its azimuth and elevation) in the sky. A beacon was left on the moon by the last Apollo mission, transmitting FSK telemetry on 2276.0 MHz =Driftnet buoy radio beacons= Driftnet radio buoys are extensively used by fishing boats operating in open seas and oceans. They are useful for collecting long fishing lines or fishing nets, with the assistance of a radio direction finder. According to product information released by manufacturer Kato Electronics Co, Ltd., these buoys transmit on 1600–2850 kHz with a power of 4-15 W. Some types of driftnet buoys, called \\"SelCall buoys\\", answer only when they are called by their own ships. Using this technique the buoy prevents nets and fishing gears from being carried away by other ships, while the battery power consumption remains low. =Distress radio beacons= Distress radio beacons, also collectively known as distress beacons, emergency beacons, or simply beacons, are those tracking transmitters that operate as part of the international Cospas-Sarsat Search and Rescue satellite system. When activated, these beacons send out a distress signal that, when detected by non-geostationary satellites, can be located by triangulation. In the case of 406 MHz beacons, which transmit digital signals, the beacons can be uniquely identified almost instantly (via GEOSAR), and a GPS position can be encoded into the signal (thus providing both instantaneous identification and position). Distress signals from the beacons are homed by search and rescue (SAR) aircraft and ground search parties, who can in turn come to the aid of the concerned boat, aircraft or persons. There are three kinds of distress radio beacons: * EPIRBs (emergency position-indicating radio beacons) signal maritime distress * ELTs (emergency locator transmitters) signal aircraft distress * PLBs (personal locator beacons) are for personal use and are intended to indicate a person in distress who is away from normal emergency response capabilities (i.e. 911) The basic purpose of distress radio beacons is to rescue people within the so-called \\"golden day\\" (the first 24 hours following a traumatic event), when the majority of survivors can still be saved. = Wi-Fi beacons= In the field of Wi-Fi (wireless local area networks using the IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g specification), the term beacon signifies a specific data transmission from the wireless access point (AP), which carries the SSID, the channel number and security protocols such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). This transmission does not contain the link layer address of another Wi-Fi device, therefore it can be received by any LAN client. =AX.25 packet radio beacons= Stations participating in packet radio networks based on the AX.25 link layer protocol also use beacon transmissions to identify themselves and broadcast brief information about operational status. The beacon transmissions use special UI or Unnumbered Information frames, which are not part of a connection and can be displayed by any station. Beacons in traditional AX.25 amateur packet radio networks contain free format information text, readable by human operators. This mode of AX.25 operation, using a formal machine- readable beacon text specification developed by Bob Bruninga, WB4APR, became the basis of the APRS networks.

Indonesian literature can refer to literature produced in the Indonesian archipelago. It is also used to refer more broadly to literature produced in areas with common language roots based on the Malay language (of which Indonesian is one scion). This would extend the reach to the Maritime Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, but also other nations with a common language such as Malaysia and Brunei, as well as population within other nations such as the Malay people living in Singapore. The phrase \\"Indonesian literature\\" is used in this article to refer to Indonesian as written in the nation of Indonesia, but also covers literature written in an earlier form of the language, i.e. the Malay language written in the Dutch East Indies. Oral literature, though a central part of the Indonesian literary tradition, is not described here. Blurred distinctions The languages spoken (and part of them written) in the Indonesian Archipelago number over a thousand, and for that reason alone it is impracticable to survey their entire literary production in one article. Since the thought of a national Indonesian language only struck root as recently as the 1920s, this means that emphasis in the present article is put on the twentieth century. At the same time, such a choice leaves a number of distinctions open. Major factors which make for a blurring of distinctions are: * the difficulty of distinguishing between Malay and Indonesian : Even in the 1930s, Malay was the lingua franca of the Archipelago, but was also used widely outside it, while a national Indonesian language was still in a state of development.Even now, Javanese is the language with most native speakers in the country (see Languages of Indonesia). One century ago, this was no different: the 1905 census showed that of 37m \\"natives\\", nearly 30m hailed from the isles of Java and Madura alone: neither they nor many other natives from the \\"outer islands\\" were Malay (cf. Bezemer 1921, p. 64). Thus, it is often difficult to ascertain where Malay leaves off and Indonesian begins. Nor is it possible to understand the development of Indonesian literature without study of the older Malay which it reacted against, and whose tradition it continued. * mutual influence between regional languages and their literatures. : A work which appears in one Indonesian language may be found in a variant form in one or more others, especially when such literature has been part of the tradition for a long time. * the problem of distinguishing between oral and written literature : Oral literature is, of course, assessed by other means than written manifestations, and field-work is one of these means. However, in the written literature, too, poetry may have been recorded which had originated as oral literature.Bezemer 1943, pp. 47ff.  Overview  During its early history, Indonesia was the centre of trade among sailors and traders from China, India, Europe and the Middle East. Indonesia was then a colony of the Netherlands (ca. 1600—1942) and Japan (1942–45). Its literary tradition was influenced by these cultures, mainly those of India, Persia, China and, more recently, Western Europe. However, unique Indonesian characteristics cause it to be considered as a separate path and tradition. Chronologically Indonesian literature may be divided into several periods: * Pujangga Lama: the \\"Literates of Olden Times\\" (traditional literature) * Sastra Melayu Lama: \\"Older Malay Literature\\" * Angkatan Balai Pustaka: the \\"Generation of the [Colonial] Office for Popular Literature\\" (from 1908) * Angkatan Pujangga Baru: the \\"New Literates\\" (from 1933) * Angkatan 1945: the \\"Generation of 1945\\" * Angkatan 1950 - 1960-an: the \\"Generation of the 1950s\\" * Angkatan 1966 - 1970-an: the \\"Generation of 1966 into the 1970s\\" * Angkatan 1980-an: the \\"Decade of the 1980s\\" * Angkatan Reformasi: the post-Suharto \\"Reformation Period\\" * Angkatan 2000-an: the \\"Generation of 2000s\\" There is considerable overlapping between these periods, and the usual designation according to \\"generations\\" (angkatan) should not allow us to lose sight of the fact that these are movements rather than chronological periods. For instance, older Malay literature was being written until well into the twentieth century. Likewise, the Pujangga Baru Generation was active even after the Generation of 1950 had entered the literary scene.  Traditional literature: Pujangga Lama  Cover of publication Syair Abdul Muluk 1847 with Jawi alphabet. Early Indonesian literature originates in Malay literature, and the influence of these roots was felt until well into the twentieth century. The literature produced by the Pujangga lama (literally \\"the old poets\\") was mainly written before the 20th century, but after the coming of Islam. Before that time, however, there must have existed a lively oral tradition.Bezemer 1943, p. 8. Within traditional Malay-language literature, sometimes it is differentiated into 3 periods: before ~1550 AD; between ~1550-1750 AD; ~1750-1900 AD.Braginsky 2004, for a summary see Malay Canonical Texts. =Genres= In written poetry and prose, a number of traditional forms dominate, mainly:— * syair (traditional narrative poetry) * pantun (quatrains made up of two seemingly disconnected couplets) * gurindam (brief aphorisms) * hikayat (stories, fairy-tales, animal fables, chronicles) * babad (histories or chronicles). =Works= Some of these works are: ; syair * Hamzah Fansuri (d. 1590 ?) ** Syair Burung Unggas ** Syair Dagang ** Syair Perahu ** Syair Si Burung pipit ** Syair Si Burung Pungguk ** Syair Sidang Fakir * Raja Ali Haji (1808–1873) ** Syair Abdul Muluk ** Syair Hukum Nikah ** Syair Siti Shianah ** Syair Suluh Pegawai * Syair Bidasari * Syair Ken Tambuhan * Syair Raja Mambang Jauhari * Syair Raja Siak ; pantun : scattered items found all over the Indonesian Archipelago, and also incorporated in other works (e.g., Sejarah Melayu) Bezemer 1943, p. 58; Braasem 1959. ; hikayat : Hikayat Abdullah (1849), Hikayat Andaken Penurat, Hikayat Bayan Budiman, Hikayat Djahidin, Hikayat Hang Tuah, Hikayat Kadirun, Hikayat Kalila dan Damina, Hikayat Masydulhak, Hikayat Pelanduk Jinaka, Hikayat Pandja Tanderan, Hikayat Putri Djohar Manikam, Hikayat Tjendera Hasan, Tsahibul Hikayat. ; historiography : Sejarah Melayu.  1870—1942: Sastra Melayu Lama  The literature of this period was produced from the year 1870 until 1942. The works from this period were predominantly popular among the people in Sumatra (i.e. the regions of Langkat, Tapanuli, Padang, etc.), the Chinese and the Indo-Europeans. The first works were dominated by syair, hikayat and translations of western novels. These are: * Robinson Crusoe (translation) * Lawah-lawah Merah * Around the World in Eighty Days (Mengelilingi Bumi dalam 80 hari) (translation) * Le Comte de Monte Cristo (translation) * Kapten Flamberger (translation by Lie Kim Hok) (1853-1912) * Rocambole (translation by Lie Kim Hok) * Nyai Dasima by G.

Pangemanann (1870-1910) * Cerita Rossina * Nyai Isah by F. Wiggers * Drama Raden Bei Surioretno * Syair Java Bank Dirampok * Lo Fen Kui by Gouw Peng Liang * Cerita Oey See (1903) by Thio Tjin Boen (1885-1940) * Tambahsia * Busono by R.M.Tirto Adhi Soerjo (1880-1918) * Nyai Permana * Hikayat Siti Mariah by Hadji Moekti (Indonesian) Angkatan Balai Pustaka =Unifying forces= Until the twentieth century, ethnic and linguistic diversity was dominant in the vast archipelago, and as a result, no national literature existed. Literature in Malay rubbed shoulders with works in other languages of the region, from Batak in the West through Sundanese, Javanese, Balinese, to Moluccan in the East. It is true that Malay was used as the lingua franca of the colony, and indeed, far beyond its borders, but it could not be regarded as a national language. At the beginning of the twentieth century, however, changes became visible. National consciousness emerged among educated Indonesians especially. At the same time, the Dutch colonisers temporarily veered to a point of view which allowed for the education and unification of the Indonesian peoples to self- reliance and maturity, as it was perceived. Indonesian independence, however, was not contemplated by the Dutch. A third factor was the emergence of newspapers, which at the beginning of the century began to appear in Chinese and subsequently in Malay.Teeuw 1980b, p. 22. =The Bureau for Popular Literature= Education, means of communication, national awareness: all these factors favoured the emergence of a comprehensive Indonesian literature. The Dutch, however, wished to channel all these forces, nipping any political subversiveness in the bud while at the same time instructing and educating Indonesians, in a way the government saw fit. For those reasons, an official Bureau (or: Commission) for Popular Literature was instituted under the name Balai Pustaka, which became some sort of government-supervised publisher. Besides preventing criticism of the colonial government, Balai Pustaka blocked all work that might be conducive to any sort of religious controversy, and anything \\"pornographic\\" was avoided: even a novel featuring divorce had to be published elsewhere. At the same time, school libraries were founded and were supplied by the new publisher. Works in Dutch as well as translations of world literature were brought out, but a burgeoning indigenous literature was also stimulated.Teeuw 1973, Uhlenbeck 1986. From 1920 to 1950 Balai Pustaka published many works in high Malay (as opposed to everyday \\"street Malay\\"), but also in Javanese and Sundanese, and occasionally also in Balinese, Batak or Madurese. =The first Indonesian novel= Marah Roesli, one of first Indonesian novelists. During this period, whose heyday was in the 1920s, Indonesian literature came to be dominated by fiction (both short stories and novels), and Western-style drama and poetry, which gradually replaced the earlier syair, gurindam, pantun and hikayat. Merari Siregar's Azab dan Sengsara was the very first modern novel appearing in Indonesian, constituting a break with the Malay romance tradition. While not completely successful, in that it rather schematically deals in black-and-white oppositions, and directly addresses the reader, subverting its realism, this may still be regarded as the first treatment of contemporaneous problems (i.e., the issue of forced marriage) in the realist tradition.Teeuw 1980b, p. 82; Seribu Tahun Nusantara 2000, p. 530. = Authors and works of the Balai Pustaka Generation= * Merari Siregar (1896-1941) ** Azab dan Sengsara (1920) ** Binasa kerna Gadis Priangan (1931) ** Cinta dan Hawa Nafsu * Marah Roesli (1889-1968) ** Sitti Nurbaya (1922) ** La Hami (1924) ** Anak dan Kemenakan (1956) * Muhammad Yamin (1903-1962) ** Tanah Air (1922) ** Indonesia, Tumpah Darahku (1928) ** Kalau Dewi Tara Sudah Berkata ** Ken Arok dan Ken Dedes (1934) * Nur Sutan Iskandar (1893-1975) ** Apa Dayaku karena Aku Seorang Perempuan (1923) ** Cinta yang Membawa Maut (1926) ** Salah Pilih (1928) ** Karena Mentua (1932) ** Tuba Dibalas dengan Susu (1933) ** Hulubalang Raja (1934) ** Katak Hendak Menjadi Lembu (1935) * Tulis Sutan Sati (1898-1942) ** Tak Disangka (1923) ** Sengsara Membawa Nikmat (1928) ** Tak Membalas Guna (1932) ** Memutuskan Pertalian (1932) * Djamaluddin Adinegoro (1904-1967) ** Darah Muda (1927) ** Asmara Jaya (1928) * Abas Soetan Pamoentjak ** Pertemuan (1927) * Abdul Muis (1886-1959) ** Salah Asuhan (1928) ** Pertemuan Djodoh (1933) * Aman Datuk Madjoindo ** Menebus Dosa (1932) ** Si Cebol Rindukan Bulan (1934) ** Sampaikan Salamku Kepadanya (1935) Interlude: the '20s Generation Meanwhile, not all publications in the languages of Indonesia appeared under the Balai Pustaka imprint. As mentioned, this publisher was a government-supervised concern, and it operated in the context of political and linguistic developments. Notable among these developments were an increasing consciousness of nationality, and the emergence of Indonesian as the embodiment of a national language. Nur Sutan Iskandar was the most active authors and he could be called as \\"the King of Balai Pustaka Generation\\". When viewed the original author, could said that the novels of a raised in the generation are \\"novel Sumatera\\", with the Minangkabau as the centre point. =Politics= In 1908, Budi Utomo, the first indigenous movement, was founded. Conceived as a political organisation, it soon adapted its objectives under pressure from the Dutch government, and mainly restricted itself to cultural activities.Brouwer 1958, pp. 37-38. Political concerns were more prominent in Sarekat Islam, founded in 1912 as a society of tradesmen, but which soon evolved into a nationalist movement, counting among its members the future President of the Republic, Sukarno, and the communist Semaun. Meanwhile, other societies were founded, and a political party mainly aimed at halfcaste Dutch and Indonesian members appeared. In due course, the Dutch colonizers followed suit, and a Volksraad (Dutch East Indies) (\\"People's Council\\") was founded in 1918.Brouwer 1958, Ch. IV. This Council was an assembly of Dutch and Indonesian members, whose powers, however, were severely restricted. It was a consultative committee advising the Governor General, the Dutch viceroy of the East-Indies, who could react to the Council's advice as he pleased. =Language= One of the first actions the Volksraad took was to request the sanction of the use of two official languages in its meetings: Dutch and Malay. Although until well into the 1930s only one Council member consistently used Malay,De Vries 1980, p. 106. it was significant that the language had now acquired official status. In 1928, an association of young Javanese intellectuals referred to the language as \\"Bahasa Indonesia\\" (\\"Indonesian language\\"), for the first time, thus emphasising the notion of a national rather than an ethnic language. A few months later, on 28 October 1928, a congress of associations of young Indonesians, known as the Youth Congress (Sumpah Pemuda) adopted the principles of \\"one people, one nation, one language\\".,De Vries p. 102. and this step may be regarded as the birth of the Indonesian language. =Literature= It was, however, still a language in development. Indonesian had never been a national language, and to most Indonesians it, or its ancestral Malay, had never been their mother tongue. For all this, in addition to the publications of Balai Pustaka and its magazine Panji Pustaka,Braasem 1949, p. 153. other magazines featured work by Indonesian writers as well, although there was not as yet one particular indigenous magazine devoted exclusively to the emerging literature. However, a notable source was Jong Sumatra, a magazine founded in 1918 as the platform of Jong Sumatranen Bond, the Association of Young Sumatran intellectuals. Pujangga Baru =Forces towards renewal= As a result of all this, dominant factors in the literary landscape of the 1930s were the following: *National consciousness among young Indonesian intellectuals was well- developed. *These intellectuals had formed various groups: there existed, then, a certain degree of organisation. *The need for a national language was felt, as was the need for literary expression in that language. *While a platform for such expression existed in Balai Pustaka, this platform was considered unsatisfactory in that it was government-controlled, and therefore at odds with the urge for nationalist development. The intervention of Dutch language officials was felt to be censorship, and the editorial policy was regarded as an unwarranted harnessing of the emerging language. (Thus, certain words were invariably replaced by more \\"respectable\\" synonyms, which seemed to curtail language development as well as freedom of expression.Jassin 1987, pp. 18-19.) *At the same time, young intellectuals felt that their classic Malay literature had congealed into set turns of phrase, clichéd descriptions and conventional plots.Jassin 1987, pp. 16-17. While literature cannot but operate between the polarities of convention and renewal, classic conventions were now felt to be over-constrictive, and their Western-style schooling had made them conscious of the possibilities for renewal. =A new magazine= Cover of August 1937 magazine Poedjangga Baroe. Angkatan Pujangga Baru was created as a reaction to all this. This \\"Generation of the New Literates (or New Poets)\\" adopted its very name, Poedjangga Baroe, to emphasise its striving for renewal, attempting to break away both from the set forms of traditional Malay literature and from the yoke of colonial constraints: the objective was a new poetics and a new national consciousness. To this end, in 1933 they founded the first national literary magazine, Poedjangga Baroe,Spellings here, as elsewhere, may vary due to the spelling reform of 1972. Thus, the title page of the magazine displays the title Poedjangga Baroe, whereas modern spelling dictates Pujangga Baru. An intermediate version, Pudjangga Baru, is also occasionally found. The present article as a rule uses the modern spelling, except where previous forms have been expressly retained. created by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Amir Hamzah (regarded as the greatest of the poets of the late colonial period),Braasem 1954, p. 36; Teeuw 1980a, p. 333. and Armijn Pane. Its main protagonists were the three founders, together with Sanusi Pane (brother of Armijn). The magazine was published between 1933 and 1942. When the Japanese occupied the country, a request on the part of the editors for permission to continue publication went unanswered, and this was tantamount to a refusal.Jassin 1987, p. 27. Publication was resumed in 1948, until the magazine finally folded in 1953. Although influential as the pioneering platform of an emerging Indonesian literature, sales had never been comfortable: Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana has revealed that the periodical's subscription was never much more than 150. Distribution of information had long been a problem in the Netherlands East Indies (Pigeaud 1949, p. 128), and this problem was compounded by the fact that pre-war indigenous literacy was as low as 6 % of the population (François n.d., p. 25). =Characteristics= Poedjangga Baroe occasionally, and for reasons that have not been explained, included prose in English, and more regularly and perhaps understandably, prose and poetry in Dutch.Jassin 1987, pp. 28-29. However, the magazine was characterised by its position as the first literary periodical in the national language. In contrast with Panji Pustaka (the Balai Pustaka magazine), its editors were all Indonesians, who had as often as not received their editorial training by working for the government publishers in the 1920s. There was one exception: Beb Vuyk, an Indo-European (Eurasian) author of Dutch nationality but with strong nationalist sympathies, was briefly on the editorial board before the war broke out.Scova Righini 2005, p. 174. The contents of the magazine were dominated by essays, often touching on the requirements and exigencies of the new literature; and by poetry in the modern vein. This modernism was a conscious breakaway from tradition, although two quite distinct tendencies were discernible. Romanticism On the one hand, poets (who usually had had a Dutch schooling) connected with a late Romantic movement in Dutch poetry, the Beweging van Tachtig.Jassin 1987, p. 23. (Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana was the main proponent of this tendency.) * This \\"Movement of the 1880s\\" had put emphasis on the individual expression of emotions, and it is this emphasis which was reflected in the new Indonesian poetry. The central role of individual emotions is borne out by the titles of some poems; representative instances are: Mengeluh (\\"Complaint\\"), Kematian Anak (\\"The Death of a Child\\"), or Di Kakimu (\\"At Your Feet\\").Jassin 1987. * Nature poetry, in addition, bore witness to the romantic nature of this movement, with titles such as Sawah (\\"Rice Fields\\") or Bintang (\\"Stars\\"). * A third aspect involved mysticism, Sanusi Pane's poem Do'a (\\"Prayer\\") perhaps the best-known instance, with its opening stanza:Jassin 1987, p. 248. > * The influence of Romanticism was discernible, too, in the use of > westernising verse forms, notably the sonnet. This constituted a break with > traditional syair and pantun. At the same time, practitioners of the new > sonnet form maintained that it had its similarities with the pantun.

It was the poets' task, > Poedjangga Baroe maintained, to be a social agent, a force for national > development. To some of its members, too, the role of the poet was a > religious one.Jassin 1987, p. 25.

The individual chapters were serialized in Magazine Z, and compiled into three tankōbon volumes released by Kodansha from February 2003 to March 2004. Set in Ikebukuro, Japan, the series revolves around the struggle of two stray cat groups. Cyan, a young newly abandoned cat, joins one of them, the Free Collars. Each cat has two appearances; to humans, they appear as normal cats, but to other cats, they appear as catboys and catgirls. Each cat has their own attack, and some carry weapons. While drawing the series, Fujima changed his art style from one used previously, though he was asked to use his original styling. He also noted that the series was different from his other works, and was unsure of how the audience would respond to it. Free Collars Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey, which released the series in 2007, and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi, which released it in 2008. It was licensed for regional release by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan, Jonesky in Hong Kong, and Star Comics in Italy. Free Collars Kingdom garnered mixed reviews from critics. The series was praised for its artwork and humor, but criticized for its plot and characters. Plot Cyan is a young Abyssinian cat who lives with a boy named Kokoro and his parents in Ikebukuro. When Kokoro becomes sick, his parents abandon Cyan, leaving him in the basement of their apartment complex. Soon he discovers a group of stray cats called the \\"Free Collars\\", who control East Ikebukuro and believe that collars hold down cats' \\"Wild Spirit\\". Cyan is given the opportunity to join, provided that he removes his collar, the symbol that he is still Kokoro's pet. Cyan declines, opting to remain in the basement and await Kokoro's return. However, Cyan comes to realize that he must join the Free Collars if he hopes to survive and reunite with Kokoro. He removes his collar and joins them in their fight against Siam, a rival gang leader who wants control of East Ikebukuro and plans to rule the world and enslave humans. In his ensuing adventures, Cyan grows close to the Free Collars, yet still longs for Kokoro. He becomes frustrated by Siam's continued advances on East Ikebukuro and his teammates' unwillingness to mount an offensive attack. Convinced that Siam must be destroyed, Cyan confronts her and learns she was once a Free Collar until her brother, Puriam, was chased onto a road by humans and killed by a bus. Cyan is able to defeat her, and, reminded of Puriam, Siam silently wishes him farewell. Soon after, Cyan learns that Kokoro had recovered but is moving away. Saddened by the thought of leaving the Free Collars, he meets Kokoro at the train station and gives him his torn collar as a memento. Kokoro promises to visit Cyan, and Cyan returns to his new friends. =Characters= The Free Collars are a group a stray cats who have removed their collars and refuse to have any relationship with humans. Cyan is a young Abyssinian who joins the Free Collars after being abandoned. He tends to be childlike, which sometimes irritates other members of the group. Scottie is a Scottish Fold who spends much of her time with the Free Collars but is not a member. She was discovered by Amesho, an old American Shorthair and leader of the Free Collars, in a bookstore. Char is a Chartreux and was once part of the \\"Cat House Kingdom\\", a household of high-class cats, but left, feeling she was being used by humans. Rat is a Korat and the most talented with gadgets and technology within the group. Coon is an easily angered Maine Coon who specializes in swimming. Minky is a Tonkinese who befriends Cyan and Scottie and is named after her mink-like fur. On the opposing side is Siam, a Siamese cat who controls all of West Ikebukuro and is the leader of the Siam Army. Siam's principal henchman and general of the Siam Army is Kline, who has a distinct hatred for humans and sees them only as her potential slaves. Acting as Siam's bodyguards are A-Ko and I-Ko, two Manx cats. Having been previously discriminated against for their lack of tails, A-Ko and I-Ko pretended to have tails, fearing rejection from Siam. Production Fujima had originally been asked to draw Free Collars Kingdom in a style he had used previously on other works. However, his drawing style evolved during the development of Free Collars Kingdom. In the first volume of Free Collars Kingdom, Fujima expressed his feelings on the series' release, while also stating that \\"it went to the press before I knew it\\". Fujima noted that the series was \\"quite a bit different\\" compared to previous series he had worked on, and that he \\"had no idea how\\" the audience would respond to it. He explained that \\"if you have fun reading it, then I'll be happy\\". In volume two, due to having left-over \\"open pages\\", Fujima used the extra pages to \\"describe characters\\" and \\"have fun\\". Media Written and illustrated by Fujima Takuya, the individual chapters of Free Collars Kingdom were first serialized in Japan in Magazine Z from 2002 to 2004. Those chapters were collected and published in three tankōbon volumes by Kodansha, with the first released on February 21, 2003 and the last on March 23, 2004. On July 27, 2010, the company Ichijinsha released a reprint of the series in two collected volumes. The series is licensed for English language release in North America by Del Rey, which published the series from January 30, 2007 to July 31, 2007. In the United Kingdom, it was published by Tanoshimi from February 1, 2007 to August 2, 2008. It is also licensed for regional language releases in Taiwan by Tong Li Publishing, in Italy by Star Comics, and Hong Kong by Jonesky. =Volume list= Reception Free Collars Kingdom received mixed reviews from English-speaking audiences. Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork, noting that characters were \\"cute and sexy with a wide variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character's personality\\" and that, overall, the artwork was \\"very clean with attractive characters and well-detailed backgrounds\\". In his review of the second volume, Alexander wrote that \\"so far, the story continues to be a fun examination of what life might be like from the cat's point of view, but I don't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume\\". In his review of the third volume, Alexander felt that \\"the story probably received an early ending\\", but concluded that \\"despite the series only being three volumes, it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you've ever owned a cat\\". In reviewing the second volume, Manga Life Dan Polley felt \\"Fujima [did] a very good job of laying down the framework and executing a plot for fun and carefree adventures.\\" In his review of the third volume, Polley wrote that \\"the art is enjoyable, but can sometimes be overloaded\\" and that \\"often there are sequences in which there is too much going on and it is hard to decipher exactly what the eyes are seeing.\\" However, he noted that \\"fans of the series will continue to enjoy the animalistic cheekiness.\\" Writing for School Library Journal, Benjamin Russell criticized the series for being \\"slow and formulaic\\" with \\"similarly formulaic\\" character designs that made \\"it seem staid\\". He also stated that the \\"animal world\\" portrayed could be fun and that it was \\"interesting to see humanoid characters so tiny next to artifacts of human culture\\", but it failed to hold the reader's interest. Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story, grading it as an \\"F\\" and calling it \\"a pastiche of a large number of manga and anime clichés, not because it seems like it was intended to be a pastiche, but because the manga artist [Fujima] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent, unified storyline that is his own, original creation.\\" However, Brienza did praise the artwork, grading it as an \\"A\\" and calling it rich and \\"beautifully drawn\\". In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson notes that the series' \\"hook\\" is that characters are all \\"drawn as hot anthropomorphic cat-girls and cat-boys\\" and praises it for having a \\"unique twist\\".

The editor of a proposed fashion magazine wanted a science fiction story about a clothing designer. Asimov agreed, and wrote the story in November 1978.

The story was one of three Asimov wrote in the late 1970s set among a series of O'Neill-type space habitats. Plot summary Charles Modine is a fashion designer who has been hired by a company called Space Structures, Ltd. to design wings for use in space habitats. The habitats have only recently been built, and Space Structures is having trouble attracting immigrants; they hope that the prospect of flight will attract more permanent residents. Also, if the residents take up flying on a regular basis, the regular exercise they receive will eliminate the need to keep the habitat spinning rapidly, with its attendant unpleasant Coriolis effect. Modine travels up to Space Settlement Five, where he learns that the habitat's engineers have already designed a set of wings. Unfortunately, they are difficult to master; it will be Modine's job to redesign the wings in some way that will make it easier (or at least more attractive) to fly. Modine decides to design a set of wings for himself. After a week's work, he gives a demonstration for the habitat's administrators, and it is a success. Modine realized that in the low-gravity region near the habitat's axis, the movement of fish through water would be a better model than the movement of birds through the air, so he designed flying gear with fins and flippers. \\"Wings,\\" he points out, \\"are for the birds.\\"  External links  * Category:Short stories by Isaac Asimov Category:1980 short stories Category:Works originally published in Asimov's Science Fiction ","title":"For the Birds (short story)"},{"id":"10573539","text":"Hristo Donchev Petkov (, born October 17, 1928) was a Bulgarian cross country skier who competed in the 1950s.

However, when she feels like all hope is lost, a male dressed like an angel gives her the dollar she needs. She falls in love with him immediately. At school the next day, she becomes best friends with a new student, Ouyang Yu Yan. When Xia Ya sees Yu Yan talking to the angel, she discovers that he is actually her brother, Ouyang Lei, a model. He was having a photo shoot when he gave the dollar to Xia Ya. Being the youngest of the family as well as a famous model, Lei is very spoiled and everyone lets him have his way. When Xia Ya yells at him for not looking at any of the love letters he has, he begins to develop an interest in her. Because Xia Ya is willing to help others unconditionally, Lei begins to like her more and more.

It was first performed at the St Martin's Theatre, London, in 1920, and made its way to the Bijou Theatre, Broadway, in the same year. It was included in Burns Mantle's The Best Plays of 1920–1921. It has been made into a film twice, in 1921 and in 1931, with the latter directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Plot The plot tells the story of the interaction between two very different families in rural England just after the end of the First World War. Squire Hillcrist lives in the manor house where his family has lived for generations. He has a daughter, Jill, who is in her late teens and a wife Amy, as well as servants and retainers. He is \\"old money\\", although his finances are at a low ebb. The other family is the nouveau riche Hornblowers, headed by the single-minded and rich industrialist Hornblower who throws old retainers the Jackmans out of their home (much to the Squire's disgust), and who plans to surround the Hillcrist’s rural estate with factories. Hillcrist wants to preserve the last piece of open land (known as the \\"Centry\\") which adjoins their property but he is (as he sees it) tricked out of the land in an auction. The Hillcrists plan to get even with the upstart Hornblower and fortuitously learn a dark secret about Mr. Hornblower's daughter-in-law Chloe who had once supported herself as the \\"other party\\" in divorce cases. When he is told the news, Mr. Hornblower agrees to sell the property to the Hillcrists for less than half the auction price on the condition that the family swears to keep the secret, but the news leaks out via the unprincipled Dawker, Hillcrist's agent and Hornblower’s enemy. Chloe Hornblower goes to the Hillcrists, begging them to help keep the secret from her husband, who is aware that something is going on, then hides behind a curtain when her husband storms into the Hillcrist home demanding to know the secret. Keeping his promise to Chloe, Mr. Hillcrist makes up a story, but the young Hornblower is not convinced and declares that he intends to end his marriage, even though Chloe is pregnant. Upon hearing this, Chloe runs to the lily pond outside the Hillcrist home and tries to drown herself. She is brought into the house and it is clear that she will live. List of characters *Hillcrist.................A Country Gentleman *Amy................ ....His Wife *Jill................... ....His Daughter *Dawker................His Agent *Hornblower..........A Man Newly-Rich *Charles................His Elder Son *Chloe...................Wife to Charles *Rolf.................... .His Younger Son *Fellows................Hillcrist's Butler *Anna....................Chloe's Maid *The Jackmans.....Man and Wife *An auctioneer, a solicitor, two strangers Theme *\\"Who touches pitch shall be defiled\\" The Skin Game first appeared less than two years after the end of the First World War and although not mentioned, some see it as hanging over the drama. The shambling Squire could be seen as a representative of the declining upper class and Hornblower as one who will not let the old style patrician class get them into such a mess again. But this is supposition – though supported by Hillcrist’s cry “Who knows where things end when once they begin?” The attitudes of Hillcrist and his wife are Victorian and Galsworthy was deliberately pointing them out to be so. He was also signalling change in the depiction of the daughter Jill who is modern in her outlook and who, at the beginning of the play, argues for an accommodation rather than a standoff with the Hornblowers. The twenties were to be the age of the flapper and of the final abandonment of Victorian/Edwardian formality and values. It was also to be the era of the rise of the middle class – here represented by the ambitious Dawker and the comically skilful auctioneer (the auction scene is an amusing piece of comic writing providing a pleasant counterpoint to the darker happenings which dominate). Galsworthy’s magnum opus known as The Forsyte Saga was being completed at around the same time that he was writing The Skin Game and there are similar themes of social change and the breakdown of conventional class structures in both. The prescience of Galsworthy in foreseeing what was to come between the wars is remarkable. So whilst the main characters are deliberate caricatures this allows an unequivocal conclusion that Galsworthy was not taking sides in the dispute – even wanting to put a plague on both their houses. The young people (Jill Hillcrist and Rolf Hornblower) are the most rational and conciliatory characters and one feels comfortable that the future belongs to them not to their prejudiced parents. For some the 1920s might be seen as the last stand of the “Gentleman” before this notion was swept away by the forces that (for example) Evelyn Waugh was to describe in Brideshead Revisited. In Brideshead these forces are depicted by the uncouth Canadian Rex Mottram. Here it is the even rougher Hornblower who challenges the conventions of the past. “Here ye are” he says to Hillcrist, “quite content on what your fathers made for ye. Ye've no ambitions; and ye want other people to have none.” Selected production history *2007 Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond, revival by Sam Walters.

It is distinct from a proto-cathedral, the term in the Roman Catholic Church for a former cathedral, which typically results from moving an episcopal see to another (usually new) cathedral, in the same or another city. In a broader context, the term 'proto-cathedral' may be used of a church used by a bishop before a settled cathedral (or pro-cathedral) has been designated.  Usage  = Europe = In Ireland, the term is used to specifically refer to St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin since the Anglican Reformation in Ireland, when Christ Church Cathedral and St Patrick's Cathedral became the property of the (Anglican) Church of Ireland. In Scotland, the term is used to refer to St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Edinburgh, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh, as the original St Andrews Cathedral was abandoned after the Scottish Reformation in 1560 and is currently in a ruinous state. St Andrew's Pro-Cathedral in Glasgow has been the seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Glasgow since 1889. The original Glasgow Cathedral however had been re-established as the Church of Scotland’s High Kirk of Glasgow after the Scottish Reformation. Details of some 15 former pro- cathedrals (11 Roman Catholic and 4 Anglican) can be found in the List of former cathedrals in Great Britain. The (Anglican) Parish Church of St Helier in Jersey serves as the island's pro-cathedral. In Spain, the Colegiata de San Isidro, Madrid served as the provisional cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madrid from its creation in 1885 until 1993, when Pope John Paul II consecrated the newly completed Almudena Cathedral. In Valletta, Malta, there is an Anglican St Paul's Pro-Cathedral. In Poland, Carmelite Church, Warsaw served as a pro-cathedral until the reconstruction of St John's Cathedral. In Albania, the Albanese Apostolic Administration of Southern Albania had the Kisha e Shën Maria dhe Shën Luigji, in Vlore, as only episcopal see of its Eastern Catholic particular sui jurus Albanian Catholic Byzantine Church. = Asia = In Baku (capital of Azerbaijan), the Church of the Immaculate Conception is the pro-cathedral episcopal see of the Apostolic Prefecture of Baku. The Church of San Antonio de Motael was the pro-cathedral of Dili, East Timor before the Immaculate Conception Cathedral was constructed in 1989.Kohen, A. S. From the Place of the Dead. Lion Publishing plc, 1999. In the Philippines, the Episcopal Diocese of the Central Philippines had the St. Stephen's Parish in Tondo, Manila as its pro-cathedral before the see was transferred to the Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint John in Quezon City. Also, in February 2012, the Pro-Cathedral Church of San Fernando de Dilao became the Pro-Cathedral of the Archdiocese of Manila, until the structural renovations of Cathedral-Basilica of the Immaculate Conception on March 25, 2014. The cathedral was reopened to the general public on April 9, 2014. Meanwhile, San Diego Pro-Cathedral, Silay serves permanently as a pro- cathedral of the Diocese of Bacolod, a ready provisional co-cathedral in instances of regular repairs and maintenance being made to the main cathedral. The Cathedral of the Holy Name, Mumbai, was previously the pro-cathedral of the Holy Name. = Americas = In San Luis Obispo, California, the parish church of Old Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa and in Salinas, CA, the parish of Madonna Del Sasso, were both elevated to pro-cathedral status by the late Bishop Richard Garcia. In Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan, the parish church of Saint Peter's was the pro-cathedral for the Anglican southern Saskatchewan diocese until 1944. From 1944 to 1979, St. Paul's Cathedral served as the pro- cathedral before it was elevated to cathedral status. In the United States, the church of St. Paul the Apostle in Savannah, Georgia, is the pro-cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of Georgia. The Cathedral of the Incarnation (Baltimore) was a pro-cathedral for 35 years before the Episcopal Diocese of Maryland passed a resolution in 1955 for it to become the diocesan cathedral. St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was designated the pro-Cathedral in the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem in 1999 and as the Pro-Cathedral by the Presiding Bishop and the President of the House of Deputies of The Episcopal Church in 2001. St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church in Tonawanda, NY became a Pro-Cathedral on August 12, 2011 as part of the North American Anglican Conference, and is the seat for Bishop Bill Atwood. Furthermore, St. John Chrysostom Malankara Syrian Catholic Pro-Cathedral in Hempstead, New York for the Syro-Malankara Catholic Exarchate in the United States St. Joseph Pro-Cathedral is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden. Holy Name of Mary Pro-Cathedral in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette. St. Luke's Ministries in Copley, Ohio, is the Pro-Cathedral for the Anglican Diocese of the Great Lakes under Bishop Ronald W.

Population: History The village of Kaarlahti was known since at least the 16th century and belonged interchangeably to Russia and Sweden. Since the middle of the 18th century, it was a part of Vyborg Governorate, which, in turn, since 1812 was a part of the Grand Duchy of Finland as the Viipuri Province. In 1916, the railway station was opened. In 1918, together with the rest of the Viipuri Province, Kaarlahti became a part of independent Finland. After the Winter War, it was reclaimed by the Soviet Union. Kaarlahti became a part of Keksgolmsky District with the administrative center in Keksgolm which was a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR). On March 31, 1940, the Karelian ASSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. During the Second World War, Kaarlahti was reclaimed by Finland and then again ceded to the Soviet Union. On November 24, 1944, Keksgolmsky District was transferred from Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast. In the end of 1944 a large granite quarry and processing plant (now belonging to JSC Granit-Kuznechnoye) was developed, and Kaarlahti started to grow steadily. In 1948, the station was renamed Granitnaya, and the settlement was renamed Kuznetsy, subsequently Kuznechnaya. On January 13, 1949 the settlement was renamed Kuznechnoye. In 1961, it was granted urban-type settlement status. Economy The economy of the settlement is based on granite production. There are several quarries surrounding Kuznechnoye. =Transportation= Kuznechnoye is also an important station of the Saint Petersburg-Khiytola railroad, being the final destination of many passenger trains coming from Finlyandsky Rail Terminal of St. Petersburg (about 3 h 25 min as of 2007) and from Sortavala (about 2 h 45 min as of 2007) and a stop of the St. Petersburg–Kostomuksha trains.

Thurcytel of Crowland is known from the unreliable history of Crowland Abbey attributed to Pseudo-Ingulf, an account full of anachronisms including the claim that Thurcytel was Lord Chancellor of England. The gist of this account is that Thurcytel is a kinsman and servitor of several Kings of England, from Edward the Elder onwards, and fights at the battle of Brunanburh. He retires from secular life in the reign of King Eadred to become abbot of Crowland, which he has refounded and endowed with lands and treasures in 948. Pseudo-Ingulf's account indicates that Thuryctel died on 28 June 975. Thurcytel of Crowland has long been identified with the Thurcytel who was abbot of Bedford Abbey at about the same time. Lewis, however, notes that \\"the case is not clear-cut\\". This Thurcytel was a kinsman of Oscytel, Archbishop of York, and, thus, also of Oscytel's successor Oswald of Worcester. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that Archbishop Oscytel was buried at Bedford Abbey by Thurcytel in 971.

The George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra is a musical institution located in Bucharest, Romania. Founded on 7 May 1868 under the supervision of Eduard Wachman, the Romanian Philharmonic Society had as purpose the creation of a permanent symphonic orchestra in Bucharest. Its first concert took place on 15 December of the same year . After the palace of the Romanian Athenaeum was built in 1888, the orchestra inaugurated that building with a concert on 5 March 5, 1889 and the Athenaeum became the new home of the orchestra, as it has remained ever since . Wachman, who conducted the first permanent orchestra until 1907, was followed by Dimitrie Dinicu (1868–1936), and himself was followed as the principal conductor, starting in 1920, by George Georgescu, a student of both Arthur Nikisch and George Enescu . After World War II, the institution diversified its activity by creating the Academic Choir, a nucleus of soloists (such as Maria Kardas Barna who was a permanent piano soloist until 1971), and several chamber ensembles. After the death of George Enescu in 1955, the Philharmonic was renamed George Enescu Philharmonic Orchestra in his honour. Likewise, the Orchestra is, by tradition, the first to play at the George Enescu Festival. The Philharmonic's principal conductors have included Constantin Silvestri, Mircea Basarab, Dumitru Capoianu, Ion Voicu, Mihai Brediceanu, and Cristian Mandeal. Since 2010, the general director has been Andrei Dimitriu and, as of 2015, the artistic director is the pianist Nicolae Licaret .

Each faction has its own campaign consisting of 15 missions each, and there is also a multiplayer mode which allows up to 6 people to play via LAN or modem/serial connection. KKnD: Xtreme is an improved and extended version of KKnD, released on October 30, 1997. The successor, KKND2: Krossfire, was released in 1998. Story In the year 2079 conflicts arose between the major nations of Earth. A nuclear war resulted of this and the surface of the planet was destroyed. Some humans managed to burrow under the Earth's crust before the nukes obliterated the upper world, taking with them what they could salvage. They turned their attention to constructing machines to resurface. Those who survived the blasts yet lived above ground mutated, and dominated the Earth until the survivors broke through the Earth's surface and an armed conflict between the two groups erupted. The single player campaign chronicles a war in 2140 which is eventually won by the faction chosen by the player. Reception According to Tim Ansell of The Creative Assembly, sales of KKnD reached 600,000 copies. Its success was an inspiration for the company's own Shogun: Total War, as Ansell considered KKnD \\"an absolute pile of crap\\" that showed the ease of success for real-time strategy games at the time.

It is sometimes known as Deutschrussisch in German or Nemrus in Russian. Some speakers of the mixed language refer to it as Quelia. It is spoken by some russophone immigrants in Germany from the former Soviet Union.  Grammar  Russian acts as the linguistic substratum, supplying the syntactic structure into which German words are inserted. The German content varies from speaker to speaker, but can be as high as 50% of the vocabulary. The situation is somewhat akin to Spanglish in the United States. Gender may be influenced by Russian genders, as in the case of most words ending in '-ung', which are always feminine in German, but usually masculine in the mixed language because Russian nouns ending in a hard consonant are always masculine. However, some words inherit their gender from the German noun, as in the feminine какая хорошая from German feminine die Überraschung, meaning 'surprise'. A mixed language makes greater use of the uncommon Russian auxiliary verbs иметь , meaning 'to have' and быть , meaning 'to be'. The corresponding verbs (haben and sein respectively) are very common in German. German verbs are often treated in a sentence as though they were Russian verbs, being russified by replacing the German infinitive verb ending. -(e)n with the Russian -. For example, German spüren becomes шпюрать , 'to feel' The following features vary from speaker to speaker: *Adopting the German terms for certain everyday items, particularly if the word has fewer syllables than the Russian equivalent. *Adopting the German terms for the realities of immigrant life, such as Arbeitsamt ('labor office'), Sozial (a shortening of Sozialhilfe, meaning 'social assistance'), Termin (date), Vertrag (contract). *Literal translation of Russian terms or phrases into German (calques). *Using the German pronunciation of proper names rather than the 'russified' pronunciation based on transliteration into Cyrillic. For example, in Russian 'Einstein' is written 'Эйнште́йн', and pronounced . But in this mixed language would be pronounced , the German pronunciation of Einstein. Also (Ляйпциг) for 'Leipzig' instead of the russified ' (Лейпциг), and for 'Freud' instead of . *There is at least one example of a neologism. Arbeits'слёзы, pronounced arbaytslyozy, could be a form of the German word Arbeitslosengeld (meaning 'unemployment pay'). The word has undergone an interesting phonetic and semantic shift. Casual or incomplete articulation of Arbeitslosengeld may be vocally realized as Arbeitslose, meaning 'an unemployed person', but the word takes on a new meaning because the Russian word слёзы (sljozy) means 'tears'. The resulting word in a mixed language, Arbeits'слёзы, means 'unemployment pay' but it might be better translated as 'unemployment pain'.

High concentrations of the dye are toxic to animal cells, however concentrations in the region of 10 micromolar are typically sufficient to give strong staining with minimal cell death. CFDA-SE enters cells by diffusion and is cleaved by intracellular esterase enzymes to form an amine-reactive product, CFSE. This product produces a detectable fluorescence and covalently binds to intracellular lysine residues and other amine sources. Most cell types will excrete a proportion of the dye over the course of the first 24–48 hours following staining. Dye levels should thereafter remain relatively stable in non- dividing cells. If a stained cell divides, the dye is divided equally between the two daughter cells, resulting in both new cells having a CFDA-SE concentration approximately 50% that of the mother cell. A cell stained with CFDA-SE can be kept in culture for several days and fluorescence is detectable in cells following up to 8 successive cell divisions. Fluorescence is typically detected using a flow cytometer on the FL1 detector, with each resulting fluorescent peak representing another round of cell division. The area of each peak is representative of the number of cells in a given division cycle. The staining works best with relatively homogeneous cell populations. CFDA-SE is often erroneously referred to as CFSE, even in scientific literature.Cell Lab Quanta SC See also * Carboxyfluorescein * Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester References Category:Fluorone dyes Category:Vital stains Category:Acetate esters Category:Succinimides ","title":"Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester"},{"id":"10573998","text":"Vincenzo \\"Cento\\" Perruchon (January 8, 1921 - June 2005) was an Italian cross country skier who competed in the 1940s and in the early 1950s.

There were only slight injuries among the staff, but the accident was a warning of the problem of premature axle failure. Sequence of events The train consisted of engine and tender, five carriages, two post office vans, and two brake vans. It left Darlington at 8.25 pm, and after about , and moving at 40 mph towards Dalton Road bridge, the driver felt a sudden shock at the back of the engine. On looking around, he saw fire flying from the tender, and shut off the steam. The fireman could not apply the tender brake since the step to the brake had broken in the incident. The driver whistled for the guard's brakes, but did not reverse the engine for fear of damage to the carriages behind. The engine came to a dead stop in 220 yards from the point of alarm, and both guards and firemen went to the nearest stations to alert any oncoming trains of the blockage to the line. The engine was undamaged, but the tender had lost both leading wheels, axle and axle-boxes, although it was upright with the other four wheels intact, but off the rails. Most of the following vehicles were more or less damaged and off the track, damage being mainly confined to the wheel assemblies, but injuries were minimal, with only one passenger complaining. Six post-office clerks were \\"considerably shaken\\". Investigation The tender axle was eventually found in four separate pieces, having fractured across the shaft, and the rails were severely damaged as well. The axle was made of best Lowmoor wrought iron, and had run about 220,000 miles during its 7 years service (experience had shown that these axles could last up to 10 years or 300,000 miles). The fracture surface of the principal break showed what is now called a slow growth region on the outer part of the diameter, with a fast growth section at the centre. Although Captain Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate did not recognize the problem as fatigue, he had seen many similar fracture surfaces in his career and attributed the break to the two keyways machined into the outer surface of the axle. He was quite right. The fatigue cracks probably grew from one or more of the sharp corners of the keyways, extending slowly around the circumference until the axle could no longer support its load, and the crack (or cracks) grew catastrophically. The load on an axle is complex, but involves both bending from the load in the vehicle above, and torsion from the rotation of the axle. He suggested that three or four keyways rather than two be used, effectively spreading the load. Nowadays, the sharpness of the corners would also be reduced, thereby lessening the stress concentration. Axles with thicker shafts were produced after this accident, and their use would also have helped to lower net stresses in the axle.

When the boy asks when this happened, Skip answers that it was long, long ago.... The story now shifts to a remote coastal Norwegian town. The audience is immediately introduced to Even. Even is a carpenter who has an uncanny tendency for surviving violent situations with barely getting a scratch. He is well dressed but is lounging at a bar and appears unhappy. We later learn that he is the best man for his best friend's wedding, Tord (played by Christian Skolmen). He arrives late with the rings, but Tord forgives him and the wedding ceremony goes under way. From the ceremony to the reception, Even behaves tense and awkwardly. The audience finally learns some background information when Even is asked to give a speech; during that speech, he recounts how he met the bride, Karen (Silja Salomonsen) in Italy. They returned to Norway and married. Then Karen met Tord, Even's more successful and athletic best friend, divorced Even, and married Tord, eventually becoming pregnant with Tord's child. As he says all of this, he creates an awkward moment for the guests. Tord confronts Even for his daring monologue, but Even simply says \\"You stole her from me.\\" A short while later, Tord needs to travel, and requests that Even take care and help out of the heavily pregnant Karen while he's gone. It is during this time where Karen and Even begin to become close to one another again. Even wants to impress Karen, and takes up surfing with the intention of participating in a local tournament. It is here where he meets Skip (Kim Bodnia). Skip is a retired surfer, and was apparently extremely talented. One problem is that Skip is gruff, aloof, and reluctant to train an adult. Even manages to convince Skip to teach him how to surf, whilst he develops a relationship with Karen. Skip also gradually warms up to Even. In one of the more enigmatic scenes in the film, Tord calls Karen and tells her that he will not return to Norway. Even sympathizes with Karen, but secretly rejoices. However, Tord unexpectedly returns one day. To make matters worse for Even, the tournament is cancelled due to inclement weather conditions. It turns out that a huge, monstrous wave is expected. Even, lamenting the fact that his life was rather shiftless and uneventful, decides to risk his life and ride the wave during the storm. He goes out to the shore the night of the storm, and rides the wave, as an awe- struck Skip looks on. Unfortunately, Even loses his life as soon as the wave crashes down. Coincidentally, Karen is giving birth to a boy at the moment this is happening. Karen and Tord decide to name the child Even. The final scenes shift back to Skip and the young boy, who happens to be Karen and Tord's son. The final scene shows a young Even riding a wave as his parents and Skip proudly look on.

Now based in Rockland, Maine, she serves as a \\"windjammer\\" offering sailing cruises to tourists. History Charles Riggin had her built for his dredging oyster schooner fleet and named her after his sons, Jacob and Edward. They all captained her at one time or another on the Delaware Bay. She was always known as a quick, light air vessel and her speed was proven in 1929 when she handily won the only official Oyster Dredging Race in the Delaware Bay. She was used for oyster-dredging until the 1940s, when the fishing regulations changed. The Riggin family sold her and she was converted to power to begin fishing for groundfish and mackerel in Cape Cod and Long Island Sound. In the early 1970s she was bought by Dave and Sue Allen and converted from a fishing vessel to a passenger carrying vessel which is what she remains. Her engine was removed and cabins added below to create space for guests. She is part of the Maine Windjammer fleet, carrying vacationers on 3-, 4- and 6-day sailing trips in Penobscot Bay, Maine.

Handlebars provide a mounting place for controls such as brake, throttle, clutch, horn, light switches and rear view mirrors; and they help to support part of the rider's weight. Even when a handlebar is a single piece it is usually referred to in the plural as handlebars. Construction triple clamp. Handlebars are made from round- section metal tubing, typically aluminium alloys or chrome plated steel but also of carbon fibre and titanium, shaped to the desired contour. Holes may be drilled for the internal routing of control cables such as brake, throttle, and clutch. Risers hold the handlebars above their mounting position on the upper triple clampThe fork-tubes are held in place by an upper and lower \\"triple clamp\\" (or \\"yoke\\" in the UK). The whole assembly is called a \\"triple tree\\". or the top of the fork, and may be integrated into the bar itself or separate items. Each handlebar end may contain bar-end weights to damp vibration by isolating the bar's resonant frequency from that of the engine. Electrically heated grips may be fitted to provide warmth for the rider in cold weather. =Sizes= There are several size parameters that describe most motorcycle handlebars: * Width from grip to grip may vary from a single tiller to . * May rise above triple clamp up to or more, called ape hangers when very high, or may drop a few inches below, called clubman bars. * Pullback, the distance grips are behind their mounting location, may vary from . * Diameters vary; commonly , though oversized bars of may reduce to at the grips so standard controls may be mounted.

Rumored to have originally been implemented to aid riders on motorcycles with no rear suspension to lift themselves from their seat to avoid potholes, they can also aid in a more comfortable ride since the riders hands are closer to shoulder height. However, if the position of the hands is higher than the shoulders, they may cause numbness in the hands, but the use of throttle locks or cruise controls may help alleviate such symptoms. Some jurisdictions restrict the maximum height of ape-hangers for safety reasons. * Beach bars — similar to cruiser bars, slope back toward the rider to allow a relaxed riding position. * Buckhorn handlebars — similar to ape-hangers, but shorter and curved (thereby resembling a buck's horn). They are sometimes called \\"mini-apes\\" (miniature ape-hangers), but are not. Buckhorns have a different hand positioning than mini apes. The bar ends on Buckhorns are angled in and down towards the rider, mini apes hand positioning is out and more horizontal. A good example of buckhorn handlebars are the ones on Ghost Rider's Hellbike, from the 2007 movie Ghost Rider. * Clip-ons — popular on sport bikes, in which two separate short handles are clamped directly to the fork tubes.The Motor Cycle, 17 July 1952, p.23 (supplement ix) Classified advertising: RACING MOTOR CYCLES. \\"1950 Norton 350, double knocker, clip-on fork bars, 19in wheels, Grand Prix carb, engine 100%, machine in immaculate condition, ready to race; £300.—John Surtees, Junr., 2, Palace Green, Addington, Surrey.

The first named storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, Kong-rey became the earliest-occurring typhoon since Typhoon Sudal on April 6, 2004. At its peak, it was considered to be a Category 2-equivalent typhoon by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, though re-analysis increased it to a Category 3-equivalent. Typhoon Kong-rey caused about $10,000 in damages and no injuries along its path. Meteorological history On March 26, the Naval Research Laboratory identified a broad area of low pressure in the Western North Pacific. It moved west-northwestward over the next few days, slowly gaining organisation. According to the Japan Meteorological Agency's best-track, it became a tropical depression on March 30. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert due to an increased consolidation of the low-level circulation of the system. The intensity was increased to 30 knots at the same time by the JMA, as the depression moved westward. The JTWC issued its first warning on Tropical Depression 01W late that evening local time. As it continued to strengthen, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm, the first of the season. The JMA followed suit, and named the system Kong-rey. The name was submitted by Cambodia, and refers to a character in a Khmer legend, which is also the name of a mountain. Kong-rey continued to track towards the Mariana Islands, all the while continuing to organise, causing the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm on the morning of April 2 local time, with the JTWC declaring it a typhoon later that evening. It then turned poleward, and starting moving towards the Northern Mariana Islands, passing through the islands on April 3. The JMA then upgraded it to a typhoon as it headed away from the islands.WebCite query result As Kong-rey began to take a turn to the north and east, it developed a ragged 16 nm (30 km, 18 mi)-wide eye.WebCite query result Operationally, its peak was estimated at 165 km/h (105 mph), though in post- season analysis, it was considered to have reached peak winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). It strengthened slightly further before encountering strong wind shear and colder sea surface temperatures, causing core convection to rapidly weaken, and was downgraded back to a severe tropical storm on April 4.WebCite query result As Kong-rey accelerated towards the northeast, it encountered a hostile environment related to a midlatitude trough. It began undergoing extratropical transition early on April 5 and the JTWC issued its final warning.WebCite query result The JMA issued its final warning on the morning of April 6 after it had completed extratropical transition.WebCite query result Preparations and impact TRMM image of Typhoon Kong-rey taken on April 2 as it approach the Mariana Islands, showing the intensity of rainfall associated with the storm As Kong-rey headed towards the Mariana Islands, a typhoon watch was issued for Guam, Rota, Tinian and Saipan in the morning of April 1 local time. Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness 3 was declared by the Governor of Guam at 2 p.m. local time (0400 UTC) the same day, advising residents to prepare emergency kits, review disaster plans and take necessary precautions as the storm approached. The typhoon watch was upgraded to a typhoon warning later in the day as Kong-rey approached the islands. Condition of Readiness 2 was declared across all four islands, and the Port Authority of Guam opened its Harbor of Refuge to house stranded boats.Pacific Daily News - www.guampdn.com - Hagatna, GU Radar image from Guam of Kong-rey passing through the Mariana Islands on April 3 The typhoon warnings for Guam were cancelled on April 2 after the National Weather Service office in Guam noted that damaging winds were now not expected on the island. The typhoon warning for Rota was downgraded to a tropical storm warning at the same time, and a typhoon warning was newly issued for Agrihan. Residents on Agrihan, Pagan and Alamagan were advised to take precautionary measures.WebCite query result In Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands Governor Benigno R. Fitial released non- essential government staff in the afternoon of April 2, as the Emergency Management Office began opening shelters. Furthermore, scoping meetings for an Environmental Impact Statement regarding military relocation were postponed by a fortnight. Several flights were also cancelled across the islands. The tropical storm warning for Rota and typhoon warning for Tinian and Saipan were discontinued on the morning of April 3 as the storm no longer posed a wind threat,WebCite query result and Fitial declared an all-clear for the islands.WebCite query result Condition of Readiness 1 was maintained in Agrihan, Pagan and Alamagan until late on April 3 local time, but as the storm passed, all warnings and watches were discontinued by the morning of April 4. The highest gust recorded on Guam was 28 kn (32 mph, 52 km/h) at Andersen Air Force Base, while in the Northern Mariana Islands Agrihan reported the highest gust, of 67 kn (77 mph, 124 km/h). The lowest pressure recorded in the island chain was 995.3 hPa on Saipan, although a few readings taken on other islands may not have been the lowest recorded pressure. Only minimal rainfall fell on Guam from Kong-rey. The maximum 24-hour rainfall total on the islands was measured at 2.7 inches (68.6 mm) at Saipan, although the total rainfall throughout the storm was heaviest on Agrihan, which recorded 3.58 inches (90.9 mm) over thirty hours from April 3 to April 4 local time. The storm delayed a congressional delegation to Guam, which was to be led by Texan congressman Solomon P. Ortiz. The effect of strong winds on agriculture was minimal. Several minor power outages occurred, mostly in Saipan. The cost of the power outages totaled to $10,000 (2007 USD).

The building was designed by architect Reginald Uren, of the architectural firm, Slater and Uren. The original design allowed for dynamic room configurations. The building surrounds a courtyard with a Japanese garden designed by Philip Hicks. The Sanderson building was listed Grade II* by English Heritage in 1991. After refurbishment by Philippe Starck and Denton Corker Marshall, it was reopened by Morgans Hotel Group as the Sanderson Hotel on 25 April 2000. The hotel occupies the site of 54 Berners Street, known for the Berners Street Hoax of 1810. Design features The building was constructed with a modernist steel and glass frontage that is seen in the opening footage of the Danger Man television series. The courtyard garden, situated on top of an underground car park, fronted the wholesale trade sales area to the right; the retail areas were to the left and centre. The courtyard garden, designed by landscape architect Philip Hicks, was recreated for the hotel and has been included on the English Heritage register of Parks and Gardens of Historic Interest; originally open to the sky, it was glazed over in the hotel conversion. The lobby has both lifts and a grand flying staircase which rises against a large backlit stained glass mural masking the lift shafts; this is the largest secular work by John Piper. The first floor was devoted to wallpaper displays and its lengthy retail counter allowed for conversion to a long bar. The second floor was reserved for fabric displays, while the third floor held management offices and an interior design studio. After refurbishment as a hotel, each room had a sleigh bed with a reproduction of the 1895 painting The Cloud by Prince Eugen bolted to the ceiling above, and a pair of penis-shaped dumbbells. The rooms were redesigned in 2014 by Tim Andreas. The hotel's Malaysian-European restaurant Suka was designed by India Mahdavi with furnishings by Tom Dixon. Popular culture In summer 2009, weekly live music sessions in the Sanderson's courtyard called 'Sanderson Predicts' featured new artists, including both Marina & The Diamonds and Little Boots performing before they were big stars.

He played for many years on the Laois senior football team in the centre half back position and was widely regarded as one of the outstanding players in Ireland of the 1950s. With his club Park, he was captain as they won two Laois Senior Football Championship titles in 1952 and 1953. Called up the Laois team in 1949 following outstanding performances for his Club Park, Paddy was centre back on the Laois team who were narrowly beaten by Meath in the 1951 Leinster Football Final. He would still be there in his famous no 6 jersey when Laois suffered another agonising defeat in the 1959 Leinster Football Final. He also played for his province Leinster, winning three consecutive Railway Cup medals in 1952, 1953 and 1954, all on the field of play. Only one other Laois player, Colm Browne, has managed to emulate this feat. Dunne played for the Rest Of Ireland XV in 1953 and 1954. He retired from all football following the 59 Leinster final due to a recurring back problem. A lasting tribute to Dunne's greatness in the famous blue & white jersey was his selection at centre half back on the Laois team of the millennium which was selected a few years back. In 2008 Dunne was selected to be inducted into the Laois GAA Hall of Fame. References ?

She was laid down in October 1901, launched in December 1902, and commissioned in October 1904. She was named after the Duchy of Brunswick (). The ship was armed with a battery of four guns and had a top speed of . Like all other pre-dreadnoughts built at the turn of the century, Braunschweig was quickly made obsolete by the launching of the revolutionary in 1906; as a result, her career as a front-line battleship was cut short. The ship served in II Squadron of the German fleet after entering service. During this period, she was occupied with extensive annual training, as well as making good-will visits to foreign countries. She also served as a flagship for most of her pre-war career. Surpassed by new dreadnought battleships, Braunschweig was decommissioned in 1913, but reactivated a year later following the outbreak of World War I. She was assigned to IV Battle Squadron, which operated in both the North Sea, protecting the German coast, and the Baltic Sea, where it opposed the Russian Baltic Fleet. Braunschweig saw action during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, when she engaged the Russian battleship . By late 1915, crew shortages and the threat from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Braunschweig, and she spent the rest of the war first as a headquarters ship, then as a training ship, and finally as a barracks ship. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921–22. Braunschweig served in the reformed Reichsmarine, operating as the flagship of naval forces assigned to the North Sea. She made several cruises abroad, including a voyage into the Atlantic in 1924. The ship was decommissioned again in January 1926 and was stricken from the naval register in March 1931, hulked, and subsequently broken up for scrap.  Design  Line-drawing of the Braunschweig class With the passage of the Second Naval Law under the direction of Vizeadmiral (VAdm—Vice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz in 1900, funding was allocated for a new class of battleships, to succeed the ships authorized under the 1898 Naval Law. By this time, Krupp, the supplier of naval artillery to the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) had developed quick-firing, guns; the largest guns that had previously incorporated the technology were the guns mounted on the Wittelsbachs. The Design Department of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office) adopted these guns for the new battleships, along with an increase from to for the secondary battery, owing to the increased threat from torpedo boats as torpedoes became more effective. Though the Braunschweig class marked a significant improvement over earlier German battleships, its design fell victim to the rapid pace of technological development in the early 1900s. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. Dreadnoughts revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including Braunschweig. Braunschweig was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced as designed and at Full load. Her crew consisted of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men. The ship was powered by three 3-cylinder vertical triple-expansion engines that drove three screws. Steam was provided by eight naval and six cylindrical boilers, all of which burned coal. Braunschweigs powerplant was rated at , which generated a top speed of . She could steam at a cruising speed of . Braunschweigs armament consisted of a main battery of four 28 cm (11 in) SK L/40 guns in twin-gun turrets, one fore and one aft of the central superstructure. Her secondary armament consisted of fourteen 17 cm (6.7 inch) SK L/40 guns and eighteen 8.8 cm (3.45 in) SK L/35 quick-firing guns. The armament suite was rounded out with six torpedo tubes, all mounted submerged in the hull. One tube was in the bow, two were on each broadside, and the final tube was in the stern. Braunschweig was protected with Krupp armor. Her armored belt was thick, with the heavier armor in the central portion that protected her magazines and propulsion machinery spaces, and the thinner plating at either end of the hull. Her deck was thick. The main battery turrets had 250 mm of armor plating.  Service history  Braunschweig at her launching on 20 December 1902 =Construction to 1914= Braunschweig was laid down on 24 October 1901 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel under construction number 97. The first of her class, she was ordered under the contract name \\"H\\" as a new unit for the fleet. The Braunschweig class, which took its name from the lead ship, included four other vessels: , , , and . The ship was launched on 20 December 1902 and was named for the Duchy of Braunschweig, and was commissioned into the fleet on 15 October 1904. She then began sea trials, which lasted to the end of December. She had already been assigned to II Squadron of the main fleet on 25 September, taking the place of the old coastal defense ship , though she did not formally join the unit until after trials concluded in late December. Upon joining the squadron, she replaced the battleship as the flagship of Konteradmiral (KAdm—Rear Admiral) Alfred Breusing, the squadron's deputy commander. Haakon VII's boat alongside on 28 November 1905 For the next several years, Braunschweig and the rest of the fleet were occupied with the peacetime training regimen that consisted of squadron and fleet training in April and May, a major fleet cruise in June and July, followed by annual fall maneuvers with the whole fleet in August and September. The year would typically conclude with a winter training cruise. During torpedo training on 16 February 1905, Wörth ran aground off Stollergrund; Braunschweig unsuccessfully attempted to pull her free and other ships were called to come to Wörths aid. In August, before the annual fleet maneuvers, the British Channel Fleet visited the German fleet in Swinemünde. On 22 November, Prince Heinrich boarded the ship in Kiel, which then steamed to Denmark to take Prince Carl of Denmark to Norway, where he was crowned Haakon VII of Norway. Braunschweig was back in Kiel by 30 November. On 14 December, Braunschweig was replaced as the deputy commander's flagship by the battleship , which had larger facilities for a command staff. The year 1906 followed the same pattern, concluding with fleet exercises in the North Sea in December before returning to Kiel. Braunschweig resumed deputy flagship duties on 25 September 1907, when KAdm Adolf Paschen transferred his flag from Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, which was to be decommissioned. Further maneuvers in the North Sea occupied the fleet for much of the first half of 1907, followed by a summer cruise to Norway and the annual autumn maneuvers in August and September. In 1908 and 1909, the fleet, which had been renamed the High Seas Fleet, undertook major cruises into the Atlantic Ocean. During the first, which began on 13 July 1908, Braunschweig stopped in Las Palmas from 23 July to 7 August before returning to Germany on 13 August for the autumn maneuvers. The 1909 cruise began on 7 July and lasted until 1 August, and included a visit to A Coruña, Spain, from 18 to 27 July. In September 1909, after the conclusion of the autumn fleet maneuvers, the crew from Braunschweig was sent to form the core of the new dreadnought battleship , while the crew from was sent to Braunschweig. The fleet held training exercises in the Kattegat in May 1910. For the summer cruises of 1910 and 1911, the German fleet went to Norwegian waters; both years also saw winter cruises in the western Baltic. On 26 April 1912, Braunschweig was relieved as the deputy flagship by the battleship . That year, Braunschweig did not take part in the summer training cruise, instead having her crew temporarily reduced. More sailors arrived on 8 December, allowing her to return to active service with V Division of III Squadron, under the command of KAdm Ehrhard Schmidt. She took part in a winter training cruise in February and March 1913, along with exercises in the North Sea in May. The ship's return to service proved to be short-lived; on 30 July her crew was reduced a second time in Kiel, now to man the new battleship . Braunschweig was assigned to the Reserve Division of the Baltic Sea as an inactive vessel. =World War I= Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911 On 28 July 1914, Germany's ally, Austria-Hungary, declared war on Serbia, beginning World War I. That day, Braunschweig and the rest of the Reserve Division were reactivated for wartime service. The ship was recommissioned on 1 August and joined IV Battle Squadron, which also included her sister ship Elsass and the five Wittelsbach-class battleships, and was commanded by Schmidt, who had by now been promoted to Vizeadmiral. The next day KAdm Hermann Alberts, the deputy commander of the squadron, came aboard the ship, making her his flagship. The installation of necessary equipment was completed by 7 August, and the IV Squadron ships were ready for operations four days later. Braunschweig began individual and then squadron training, which lasted until early September. The training exercises were interrupted on 26 August, when the ships were sent to rescue the stranded light cruiser , which had run aground off the island of Odensholm in the eastern Baltic. By 28 August, the ship's crew had been forced to detonate explosives to destroy Magdeburg before the relief force had arrived. As a result, Braunschweig and the rest of the squadron returned to Bornholm that day for further training exercises. Starting on 3 September, IV Squadron, assisted by the armored cruiser , conducted a sweep into the Baltic. The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle. Following the operation, Braunschweig was tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea around the mouth of the Elbe. On 12 September, an accidental explosion aboard the ship killed six men and wounded sixteen more, but only lightly damaged the ship. Later that month, the IV Squadron ships were transferred back to the Baltic. The army had requested that the navy make a demonstration to keep Russian reserves along the Baltic coast, instead of allowing the Russians to re-deploy them to Galicia. On 21 September, Alberts transferred his flag to the battleship . The following day, Prince Heinrich, the commander-in-chief of naval forces in the Baltic, came aboard Braunschweig, making her his flagship for the operation, which was also to include the older pre-dreadnought battleships of the V Battle Squadron. These ships were sent to Danzig to embark ground forces, while Braunschweig and IV Squadron steamed in advance. The operation was called off early, after British submarines were reportedly sighted in the Baltic. The two squadrons rendezvoused off Bornholm before proceeded on to Kiel, arriving on 26 September. Braunschweig underway, steaming at high speed From 5 December 1914 to 2 March 1915, Braunschweig was occupied with guard ship duties in the mouth of the Elbe. On 6 May, the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau (in modern Latvia). Braunschweig and the other ships were stationed off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings; the Russians, however, did not do so. On 10 May, the British submarines and spotted IV Squadron, but were too far away to attack them. Another stint in the Elbe followed from 28 May to 3 July. The next day, following the loss of the minelaying cruiser in the Baltic, the IV Squadron ships were transferred to reinforce the German naval forces in the area. The army had again requested naval assistance, this time to support operations around Libau. On 7 July, Braunschweig left Kiel, bound for the eastern Baltic. On 11 and 19 July, German cruisers, with the IV Squadron ships in support, conducted sweeps in the Baltic, though without engaging Russian forces. In August 1915, the German fleet attempted to clear the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces, to aid the German Army advancing on the city. IV Squadron was joined by I Battle Squadron, which consisted of the eight and s, from the High Seas Fleet, along with three battlecruisers and a host of smaller craft. The task force was placed under command of VAdm Franz von Hipper, though operational command remained with Schmidt. On the morning of 8 August, the Germans made their initial push into the Gulf; Braunschweig and Elsass were tasked with engaging the Russian pre-dreadnought and preventing her from disrupting the German minesweepers. When it became clear that the minesweepers could not clear the minefield before nightfall, Schmidt called off the attempt. A second attempt was made on 16 August; this time, Braunschweig remained outside the Gulf while the dreadnoughts and took over the task of dealing with Slava. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day. Braunschweig remained in Libau until late September, when she was recalled to Kiel, arriving on the 23rd. Two days later, she resumed guard ship duty in the mouth of the Elbe, which lasted until 4 October. She returned to Kiel the next day, and on 12 October was deployed back to Libau to guard the port, along with Elsass and . On 12 October, the British submarine fired a single torpedo at Braunschweig, though it failed to hit its target. On 14 December, Kaiser Wilhelm II visited the ship. By this point in the war, the Navy was encountering difficulties in manning more important vessels, and the insufficient underwater protection of the older German battleships rendered them unusable in the Baltic, owing to the threat from submarines. As a result, IV Squadron was dissolved and most of the ships were placed in reserve. Braunschweig, however, became the flagship of VAdm Friedrich Schultz, the Commander of Reconnaissance Forces in the Eastern Baltic Sea. On 5 January 1916, Braunschweig, Mecklenburg, the light cruiser , and the X Torpedo-boat Flotilla left Libau for Kiel before continuing on to Hamburg. There, Braunschweig underwent repairs at the Blohm & Voss shipyard, which lasted from 10 January to 26 February. On 4 March, the ship arrived back in Libau, where she began her duties as Schultz's command ship. During this period, her crew was reduced to the point that she was only capable of providing harbor defense. In June, the naval command further reduced the number of ships operating in the Baltic, and Schultz, whose role had been taken over by the commander of the VI Scouting Group, left Braunschweig on 3 June. The ship left Libau for Kiel on 1 August, arriving there two days later. On 24 August, her crew was reduced further. She was thereafter used as a training ship for naval recruits, until 20 August 1917, when she was decommissioned and used as a barracks ship until the end of the war in November 1918. In this role, the ship supported III Submarine Flotilla. =Postwar career= The Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, specified that Germany was permitted to retain six battleships of the \\"Deutschland or Lothringen types.\\" Braunschweig was chosen to remain on active service with the newly reformed Reichsmarine. The ship was modernized at the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven from 1921–1922. She was recommissioned on 1 December 1921, initially with a reduced crew, though work on the ship continued on into the following year. Work was finished and her crew was completed on 1 March 1922, at which point she replaced the light cruiser as the flagship of the Marinestation der Nordsee (Naval Station of the North Sea), then commanded by KAdm Konrad Mommsen. At the time, the unit consisted of Braunschweig, Hamburg, the cruiser , and several torpedo boats. On 11 April, Mommsen was replaced by KAdm Theodor Püllen. In July, Braunschweig visited Norway, including stops in Fretheim from 8 to 13 July and Mundal from 13 to 17 July. From late August to 15 September, the ships of the Marinestation der Nordsee held joint maneuvers with those from the Marinestation der Ostsee (Naval Station of the Baltic Sea), and during these Reichspräsident (President of Germany) Friedrich Ebert came aboard the ship to observe the exercises on 5 and 6 September. In 1923, Braunschweigs bridge was rebuilt and enlarged. The ship's program followed the same pattern as the previous year, with visits to foreign ports in July; Braunschweig stopped in Helsinki, Finland, and Gothenburg, Sweden, during her trip. Joint maneuvers were held again in August and September, after which Püllen left the ship. On 15 October, VAdm Hans Zenker, then the Oberbefehlshaber der Seestreitkräfte (O.d.S—Commander of Naval Forces), reorganized the fleet structure, disbanding the North Sea and Baltic commands and replacing them with organizations based on ship type. Braunschweig was now assigned to the Linienschiffsdivision (Battleship Division), where she served as Zenker's flagship. The division also included the battleship Hannover. In February and March 1924, the ship served as an icebreaker in the Baltic. The usual cruise abroad in July 1924 ventured further than in previous years, with a trip into the Atlantic. Braunschweig stopped in A Coruña from 6 to 13 July. Fleet maneuvers followed at the end of August, and at their conclusion, the fleet anchored off Sassnitz for a naval review for Admiral Paul Behncke, the retiring Chef der Admiralität (Chief of the Admiralty). Zenker was promoted to replace Behncke, who was in turn replaced by now-VAdm Mommsen, who again made Braunschweig his flagship. Further exercises were held from 29 September to 5 October. On 1 April 1925, the command structure of the fleet was again reorganized, the O.d.S becoming the Flottenchef. The fleet was also expanded with the addition of the battleships Hessen and Elsass, though Braunschweig remained the flagship. Later that month, the battleships and cruisers of the fleet went on a cruise in the Baltic, and the summer cruise in June went to Norway. Braunschweig made stops in several cities, including Stavanger and Balholmen. Braunschweig was present during the Kiel Week sailing regatta, which also saw the visit of the Swedish fleet. On 31 January 1926, Brauschweig was decommissioned, her role as fleet flagship being taken by . On 31 March 1931, Braunschweig was stricken from the naval register and temporarily used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven before being broken up for scrap.

It depicts a pair of travellers setting off from Paris and travelling to the Villa Noailles in Hyères. At 27 minutes the film was the longest that Man Ray directed during his career. Synopsis > To the Viscountess of Noailles. I dedicate these pictures which can never > reveal the extent of her kindness and charm. How two travellers arrived in > St. Bernard, what they saw in the ruins of an old castle on top of which a > modern-time castle stands. The travellers: MAN RAY, J.-A. Boiffard. The film opens from a night scene to two masked individuals at a cafe. They decide their actions on the role of dice. > A throw of dice will never abolish chance. (based on a line from Stéphane Mallarmé) The hands are that of mannequins, their faces devoid of detail. Before the throw, their destination appears on a hillside in the form of both modern and ancient castles. > Are we going? > We're not going > We're going! And their journey begins. Departing from their cafe, they travel through the French countryside arriving at the town of Hyères and their destination to find the modern castle empty. Elements of the interior explore various spatial relationships and textures. The film shows sculptures by Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró, as well as exploring the unique Cubist garden at Villa Noailles. After a while, we are introduced to four intruders who are in turn resigning their fate to that of the dice. Upon their throw, they depart for the indoor swimming pool at the villa and entertain the viewer with various diving and gymnastic movements, including a woman juggling underwater and exercising with medicine balls. Actors explore the villas confines, until they eventually retire, fading from the screen.

There are 20 books in the series. The first ten (published from 1926-1930) are set in South America, where Bomba, a white boy who grew up in the jungle, tries to discover his origin. The second set of ten books (published from 1931-1938) shift the scene to Africa, where a slightly older Bomba has jungle adventures. A common theme of the Bomba books is that Bomba, because he is white, has a soul that is awake, while his friends, the dark-skinned natives, have souls that are sleeping. Richard A. Lupoff, in his book Master of Adventure, a study of the works of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs, describes the Bomba tales as more blatantly racist than the often- criticized Tarzan books. From 1949 through 1955, Monogram Pictures brought the character to the motion-picture screen in 12 Bomba films, starring Johnny Sheffield. Sheffield was already established as an outdoor star; he had portrayed the character Boy in the Tarzan movies with Johnny Weissmuller. When the Bomba films, all set in Africa, proved popular with young audiences, the first 10 Bomba books were reprinted in the 1950s by Grosset & Dunlap, a publisher of many popular series books such as the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew. These same books were reprinted again by Clover Books, a short-lived publisher that also reprinted the Grosset & Dunlap series Tom Quest. In 1962, WGN-TV repackaged the Bomba films as a prime time summertime series called Zim Bomba that became a local ratings sensation. WGN executive Fred Silverman stated that \\"Zim\\" meant \\"Son of\\" in Swahili.p.15 Smith, Sally Bedell Up the Tube: Prime Time TV and the Silverman Years 1981 Viking Press In 1967–68, DC Comics published a series of seven comic books based on the character. Books All of the first editions had the same picture on the dust jacket; only the title was different. The Grosset & Dunlap books had different pictures on the dust jacket of each title. The Clover editions had no dust jackets but had picture covers reprinting the Grosset & Dunlap art. #Bomba the Jungle Boy, 1926 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Moving Mountain, 1926 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy at the Giant Cataract, 1927 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy on Jaguar Island, 1927 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Abandoned City, 1927 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy on Terror Trail, 1928 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy in the Swamp of Death, 1929 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy Among the Slaves, 1929 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy on the Underground River, 1930 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Lost Explorers, 1930 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy in a Strange Land, 1931 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy Among the Pygmies, 1931 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Cannibals, 1931 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Painted Hunters, 1932 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the River Demons, 1932 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy and the Hostile Chieftain, 1934 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy Trapped by the Cyclone, 1935 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy in the Land of Burning Lava, 1936 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy in the Perilous Kingdom, 1937 #Bomba, the Jungle Boy in the Steaming Grotto, 1938 Movies =Background= Walter Mirisch had been general manager of Monogram Pictures since 1945. They specialised in low budget movies, including series of regular characters such as Charlie Chan, Joe Palooka and the Bowery Boys. Mirisch looked at the success of the Tarzan films and remembered the Bomba novels; he thought they might offer material to do a similar type of movie. In November 1947 Monogram announced they had bought the rights to twenty of the stories. They assigned Walter Mirisch to oversee their production and said they intended to make three Bomba films per year. They were going to be in colour. They were seeking a male actor aged 18 to 20 to star. In September 1948 Monogram's president Steve Broidy announced that the studio would make two Bomba films over the following year. (Other series at the studio included Joe Palooka, Charlie Chan and Bowery Boys.) Mirisch later claimed he was paid $2,500 a film, and the success of the series launched him as a producer. =Films= #Bomba, the Jungle Boy (1949) #Bomba on Panther Island (1949) #The Lost Volcano (1950) #The Hidden City (1951) #The Lion Hunters (1951) #Elephant Stampede (1952) #African Treasure (1952) #Bomba and the Jungle Girl (1952) #Safari Drums (1953) #The Golden Idol (1954) #Killer Leopard (1954) #Lord of the Jungle (1955) External links  References Category:Book series introduced in 1926 Category:Film series introduced in 1949 Category:Series of books Category:Stratemeyer Syndicate Category:Juvenile series Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:Novels set in Africa Category:Novels set in South America Category:Fictional feral children Category:Jungle superheroes Category:Jungle men Category:Film series Category:American film series ","title":"Bomba, the Jungle Boy"},{"id":"10574232","text":"Manole Aldescu (born February 18, 1929) was a Romanian cross country skier who competed in the 1950s.

What constitutes digital journalism is debated by scholars; however, the primary product of journalism, which is news and features on current affairs, is presented solely or in combination as text, audio, video, or some interactive forms like newsgames, and disseminated through digital media technology.Kawamoto 2003, p. 4. Fewer barriers to entry, lowered distribution costs, and diverse computer networking technologies have led to the widespread practice of digital journalism. It has democratized the flow of information that was previously controlled by traditional media including newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. Some have asserted that a greater degree of creativity can be exercised with digital journalism when compared to traditional journalism and traditional media. The digital aspect may be central to the journalistic message and remains, to some extent, within the creative control of the writer, editor, and/or publisher. It has been acknowledged that reports of its growth have tended to be exaggerated. In fact, a 2019 Pew survey showed of 16% decline of time spent on online news sites since 2016. Overview There is no absolute agreement as to what constitutes digital journalism. Mu Lin argues that, “Web and mobile platforms demand us to adopt a platform-free mindset for an all-inclusive production approach – create the [digital] contents first, then distribute via appropriate platforms.\\" The repurposing of print content for an online audience is sufficient for some, while others require content created with the digital medium's unique features like hypertextuality.Kawamoto, 2005, p. X. Fondevila Gascón adds multimedia and interactivity to complete the digital journalism essence.Fondevila Gascón, Joan Francesc (2010). \\"Multimedia, digital press and journalistic genres in Catalonia and in Spain: an empirical analysis\\". Communication Studies Journal, n. 7, May 2010, pp. 81-95. For Deuze, online journalism can be functionally differentiated from other kinds of journalism by its technological component which journalists have to consider when creating or displaying content.Deuze 2003, p. 206. Digital journalistic work may range from purely editorial content like CNN (produced by professional journalists) online to public-connectivity websites like Slashdot (communication lacking formal barriers of entry).Deuze 2003, p. 207. The difference of digital journalism from traditional journalism may be in its reconceptualised role of the reporter in relation to audiences and news organizations.Wall 2005, p. 156. The expectations of society for instant information was important for the evolution of digital journalism . However, it is likely that the exact nature and roles of digital journalism will not be fully known for some time. History The first type of digital journalism, called teletext, was invented in the UK in 1970. Teletext is a system allowing viewers to choose which stories they wish to read and see it immediately. The information provided through teletext is brief and instant, similar to the information seen in digital journalism today. The information was broadcast between the frames of a television signal in what was called the Vertical Blanking Interval or VBI. American journalist, Hunter S. Thompson relied on early digital communication technology beginning by using a fax machine to report from the 1971 US presidential campaign trail as documented in his book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. After the invention of teletext was the invention of videotex, of which Prestel was the world's first system, launching commercially in 1979Kawamoto 2005, p. 36. with various British newspapers such as the Financial Times lining up to deliver newspaper stories online through it. Videotex closed down in 1986 due to failing to meet end- user demand. American newspaper companies took notice of the new technology and created their own videotex systems, the largest and most ambitious being Viewtron, a service of Knight-Ridder launched in 1981. Others were Keycom in Chicago and Gateway in Los Angeles. All of them had closed by 1986. Next came computer Bulletin Board Systems. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, several smaller newspapers started online news services using BBS software and telephone modems. The first of these was the Albuquerque Tribune in 1989. Computer Gaming World in September 1992 broke the news of Electronic Arts' acquisition of Origin Systems on Prodigy, before its next issue went to press. Online news websites began to proliferate in the 1990s. An early adopter was The News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina which offered online news as Nando. Steve Yelvington wrote on the Poynter Institute website about Nando, owned by The N&O;, by saying \\"Nando evolved into the first serious, professional news site on the World Wide Web\\". It originated in the early 1990s as \\"NandO Land\\". It is believed that a major increase in digital online journalism occurred around this time when the first commercial web browsers, Netscape Navigator (1994), and Internet Explorer (1995).Scott 2005, p. 94. By 1996, most news outlets had an online presence. Although journalistic content was repurposed from original text/video/audio sources without change in substance, it could be consumed in different ways because of its online form through toolbars, topically grouped content, and intertextual links. A twenty- four-hour news cycle and new ways of user-journalist interaction web boards were among the features unique to the digital format. Later, portals such as AOL and Yahoo! and their news aggregators (sites that collect and categorize links from news sources) led to news agencies such as The Associated Press to supplying digitally suited content for aggregation beyond the limit of what client news providers could use in the past. Also, Salon, was founded in 1995. In 2001 the American Journalism Review called Salon the Internet's \\"preeminent independent venue for journalism.\\" In 2008, for the first time, more Americans reported getting their national and international news from the internet, rather than newspapers. Young people aged 18 to 29 now primarily get their news via the Internet, according to a Pew Research Center report. Audiences to news sites continued to grow due to the launch of new news sites, continued investment in news online by conventional news organizations, and the continued growth in internet audiences overall. Sixty-five percent of youth now primarily access the news online. Mainstream news sites are the most widespread form of online newsmedia production. As of 2000, the vast majority of journalists in the Western world now use the internet regularly in their daily work. In addition to mainstream news sites, digital journalism is found in index and category sites (sites without much original content but many links to existing news sites), meta- and comment sites (sites about newsmedia issues like media watchdogs), and share and discussion sites (sites that facilitate the connection of people, like Slashdot).Deuze 2003, p. 208-211.Kawamoto 2005, p. 15. Blogs are also another digital journalism phenomenon capable of fresh information, ranging from personal sites to those with audiences of hundreds of thousands.Kawamoto 2005, p. 16. Digital journalism is involved in the cloud journalism phenomenon, a constant flow of contents in the Broadband Society.Fondevila Gascón, Joan Francesc (2009). \\"El papel decisivo de la banda ancha en el Espacio Iberoamericano del Conocimiento\\". Revista Iberoamericana de Ciencia, Tecnología y Sociedad–CTS, nº 2 (julio de 2009), pp. 1-15. Portafolio CTS. . Prior to 2008, the industry had hoped that publishing news online would prove lucrative enough to fund the costs of conventional newsgathering. In 2008, however, online advertising began to slow down, and little progress was made towards development of new business models. The Pew Project for Excellence in Journalism describes its 2008 report on the State of the News Media, its sixth, as its bleakest ever.\\"The State of the News Media\\" Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. Stateofthemedia.org Despite the uncertainty, online journalists report expanding newsrooms. They believe advertising is likely to be the best revenue model supporting the production of online news.\\"Online Journalists Optimistic About Revenue and Technology, Concerned About Changing Values\\" Pew Project For Excellence in Journalism. Stateofthemedia.org Many news organizations based in other media also distribute news online, but the amount they use of the new medium varies. Some news organizations use the Web exclusively or as a secondary outlet for their content. The Online News Association, founded in 1999, is the largest organization representing online journalists, with more than 1,700 members whose principal livelihood involves gathering or producing news for digital presentation. The Internet challenges traditional news organizations in several ways. Newspapers may lose classified advertising to websites, which are often targeted by interest instead of geography. These organizations are concerned about real and perceived loss of viewers and circulation to the Internet. Hyperlocal journalism is journalism within a very small community. Hyperlocal journalism, like other types of digital journalism, is very convenient for the reader and offers more information than former types of journalism. It is free or inexpensive. =Reports of Facebook interfering in journalism= It has been acknowledged that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets. Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \\"stole the news business\\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \\"ghostwriters.\\" In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period. Impact on readers Digital journalism allows for connection and discussion at levels that print does not offer on its own. People can comment on articles and start discussion boards to discuss articles. Before the Internet, spontaneous discussion between readers who had never met was impossible. The process of discussing a news item is a big portion of what makes for digital journalism. People add to the story and connect with other people who want to discuss the topic. Digital journalism creates an opportunity for niche audiences, allowing people to have more options as to what to view and read. Digital journalism opens up new ways of storytelling; through the technical components of the new medium, digital journalists can provide a variety of media, such as audio, video, and digital photography. Digital journalism represents a revolution of how news is consumed by society. Online sources are able to provide quick, efficient, and accurate reporting of breaking news in a matter of seconds, providing society with a synopsis of events as they occur. Throughout the development of the event, journalists are able to feed online sources the information keeping readers up-to-date in mere seconds. The speed in which a story can be posted can affect the accuracy of the reporting in a way that doesn't usually happen in print journalism. Before the emergence of digital journalism the printing process took much more time, allowing for the discovery and correction of errors. News consumers must become Web literate and use critical thinking to evaluate the credibility of sources. Because it is possible for anyone to write articles and post them on the Internet, the definition of journalism is changing. Because it is becoming increasingly simple for the average person to have an impact in the news world through tools like blogs and even comments on news stories on reputable news websites, it becomes increasingly difficult to sift through the massive amount of information coming in from the digital area of journalism. There are great advantages with digital journalism and the new blogging evolution that people are becoming accustomed to, but there are disadvantages. For instance, people are used to what they already know and can't always catch up quickly with the new technologies in the 21st century. The goals of print and digital journalism are the same, although different tools are needed to function. The interaction between the writer and consumer is new, and this can be credited to digital journalism. There are many ways to get personal thoughts on the Web. There are some disadvantages to this, however, the main one being factual information. There is a pressing need for accuracy in digital journalism, and until they find a way to press accuracy, they will still face some criticism. One major dispute regards the credibility of these online news websites. A digital journalism credibility study performed by the Online News Association compares the online public credibility ratings to actual media respondent credibility ratings. Looking at a variety of online media sources, the study found that overall the public saw online media as more credible than it actually is. The effects of digital journalism are evident worldwide. This form of journalism has pushed journalists to reform and evolve. Older journalists who are not tech savvy have felt the blunt force of this. In recent months, a number of older journalists have been pushed out and younger journalists brought in because of their lower cost and ability to work in advanced technology settings. Impact on publishers Many newspapers, such as The New York Times, have created online sites to remain competitive and have taken advantage of audio, video, and text linking to remain at the top of news consumers' lists as most of the news enthusiasm now reach their base through hand held devices such as smartphones, tablets etc. Hence audio or video backing is a definite advantage. Newspapers rarely break news stories any more, with most websites reporting on breaking news before the cable news channels. Digital journalism allows for reports to start out vague and generalized, and progress to a better story. Newspapers and TV cable are at a disadvantage because they generally can only put together stories when an ample amount of detail and information are available. Often, newspapers have to wait for the next day, or even two days later if it is a late-breaking story, before being able to publish it. Newspapers lose a lot of ground to their online counterparts, with ad revenue shifting to the Internet, and subscription to the printed paper decreasing. People are now able to find the news they want, when they want, without having to leave their homes or pay to receive the news , even though there are still people who are willing to pay for online journalistic content. Because of this, many people have viewed digital journalism as the death of journalism. According to communication scholar Nicole Cohen, \\"four practices stand out as putting pressure on traditional journalism production: outsourcing, unpaid labour, metrics and measurement, and automation\\". Free advertising on websites such as Craigslist has transformed how people publicize; the Internet has created a faster, cheaper way for people to get news out, thus creating the shift in ad sales from standard newspapers to the Internet. There has been a substantial effect of digital journalism and media on the newspaper industry, with the creation of new business models.Fondevila Gascón, Joan Francesc; Del Olmo Arriaga, Josep Lluís and Sierra Sánchez, Javier (2011). \\"New communicative markets, new business models in the digital press\\". Trípodos (Extra 2011-VI International Conference on Communication and Reality-Life without Media, Universitat Ramon Llull), pp. 301-310. It is now possible to contemplate a time in the near future when major towns will no longer have a newspaper and when magazines and network news operations will employ no more than a handful of reporters. Many newspapers and individual print journalists have been forced out of business because of the popularity of digital journalism. The newspapers that have not been willing to be forced out of business have attempted to survive by saving money, laying off staff, shrinking the size of the publications, eliminating editions, as well as partnering with other businesses to share coverage and content. In 2009, one study concluded that most journalists are ready to compete in a digital world and that these journalists believe the transition from print to digital journalism in their newsroom is moving too slowly.http://www.mediamanagementcenter.org/research/lifebeyondprint.pdf Some highly specialized positions in the publishing industry have become obsolete. The growth in digital journalism and the near collapse of the economy has also led to downsizing for those in the industry. Students wishing to become journalists now need to be familiar with digital journalism in order to be able to contribute and develop journalism skills. Not only must a journalist analyze their audience and focus on effective communication with them, they have to be quick; news websites are able to update their stories within minutes of the news event. Other skills may include creating a website and uploading information using basic programming skills. Critics believe digital journalism has made it easier for individuals who are not qualified journalists to misinform the general public. Many believe that this form of journalism has created a number of sites that do not have credible information. Sites such as PerezHilton.com have been criticized for blurring the lines between journalism and opinionated writing. Some critics believe that newspapers should not switch to a solely Internet-based format, but instead keep a component of print as well as digital. Digital journalism allows citizens and readers the opportunity to join in on threaded discussions relating to a news article that has been read by the public. This offers an excellent source for writers and reporters to decide what is important and what should be omitted in the future. These threads can provide useful information to writers of digital journalism so that future articles can be pruned and improved to possibly create a better article the next time around.  Implications on traditional Journalism  Digitization is currently causing many changes to traditional journalistic practices. The labor of journalists, in general, is becoming increasingly dependent on digital journalism. Scholars outline that this is a change to the execution of journalism and not the conception part of the labor process. They also contend that this is simply the de-skilling of some skills and the up-skilling of others. This theory is in contention to the notion that technological determinism is negatively effecting journalism, as it should be understood that it is just changing the traditional skill set. Communication scholar Nicole Cohen believes there are several trends putting pressure on this traditional skill set. Some of which being outsourcing, algorithms, and automation. Although Cohen believes that technology could be used to improve Journalism, she feels the current trends in digital journalism are so far affecting the practice in a negative way. There is also the impact that digital journalism is influencing the uprising of citizen journalism. Because digital journalism takes place online and is contributed mostly by citizens on user-generated content sites, there is competition growing between the two. Citizen journalism allows anyone to post anything, and because of that, journalists are being forced by their employers to publish more news content than before, which often means rushing news stories and failing to verify the source of information. Work outside traditional press The Internet has also given rise to more participation by people who are not normally journalists, such as with Indy Media (Max Perez). Bloggers write on web logs or blogs. Traditional journalists often do not consider bloggers to automatically be journalists. This has more to do with standards and professional practices than the medium. For instance, crowdsourcing and crowdfunding journalism attracts amateur journalists, as well as ambitious professionals that are restrained by the boundaries set by traditional press. However, the implication of these types of journalism is that it disregards the professional norms of journalistic practices that ensures accuracy and impartiality of the content. But, , blogging has generally gained at least more attention and has led to some effects on mainstream journalism, such as exposing problems related to a television piece about President George W. Bush's National Guard Service. Recent legal judgements have determined that bloggers are entitled to the same protections as other journalists subject to the same responsibilities. In the United States, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been instrumental in advocating for the rights of journalist bloggers. In Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that:\\"[96] A second preliminary question is what the new defence should be called. In arguments before us, the defence was referred to as the responsible journalism test. This has the value of capturing the essence of the defence in succinct style. However, the traditional media are rapidly being complemented by new ways of communicating on matters of public interest, many of them online, which do not involve journalists. These new disseminators of news and information should, absent good reasons for exclusion, be subject to the same laws as established media outlets. I agree with Lord Hoffmann that the new defence is \\"available to anyone who publishes material of public interest in any medium\\": Jameel, at para. 54.\\" Other significant tools of on- line journalism are Internet forums, discussion boards and chats, especially those representing the Internet version of official media. The widespread use of the Internet all over the world created a unique opportunity to create a meeting place for both sides in many conflicts, such as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the First and Second Chechen Wars. Often this gives a unique chance to find new, alternative solutions to the conflict, but often the Internet is turned into the battlefield by contradicting parties creating endless \\"online battles.\\" Internet radio and podcasts are other growing independent media based on the Internet. Blogs With the rise of digital media, there is a move from the traditional journalist to the blogger or amateur journalist. Blogs can be seen as a new genre of journalism because of their \\"narrative style of news characterized by personalization\\" that moves away from traditional journalism's approach,Wall 2005, p. 154. changing journalism into a more conversational and decentralized type of news.Wall 2005, p. 157. Blogging has become a large part of the transmitting of news and ideas across cites, states, and countries, and bloggers argue that blogs themselves are now breaking stories. Even online news publications have blogs that are written by their affiliated journalists or other respected writers. Blogging allows readers and journalists to be opinionated about the news and talk about it in an open environment. Blogs allow comments where some news outlets do not, due to the need to constantly monitor what is posted. By allowing comments, the reader can interact with a story instead of just absorbing the words on the screen. According to one 2007 study, 15% of those who read blogs read them for news. However, many blogs are highly opinionated and have a bias. Some are not verified to be true. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) established guidelines mandating that bloggers disclose any free goods or services they receive from third parties in 2009 in response to a question of the integrity of product and service reviews in the online community.http://ftc.gov/os/2009/10/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf The development of blogging communities has partly resulted because of the lack of local news coverage, the spread of misinformation, and the manipulation of news. Blogging platforms are often used as mediums to spread ideas and connect to others with similar mentalities. Anonymity lives within these platforms that circulates different perspectives. Some have postulated that blogs’ usage of public opinions as facts has gained them status and creditability. Memes are often shared on these blogs due to its social phenomenon and its relation to existing subcultures which often attain high engagement. Traditional journalism has helped set the foundation for blogs, which are frequently used to question mainstream media reported by journalist. Citizen journalism Digital journalism's lack of a traditional \\"editor\\" has given rise to citizen journalism. The early advances that the digital age offered journalism were faster research, easier editing, conveniences, and a faster delivery time for articles. The Internet has broadened the effect that the digital age has on journalism. Because of the popularity of the Internet, most people have access and can add their forms of journalism to the information network. This allows anyone who wants to share something they deem important that has happened in their community. Individuals who are not professional journalists who present news through their blogs or websites are often referred to as citizen journalists. One does not need a degree to be a citizen journalist. Citizen journalists are able to publish information that may not be reported otherwise, and the public has a greater opportunity to be informed. Some companies use the information that a citizen journalist relays when they themselves can not access certain situations, for example, in countries where freedom of the press is limited. Anyone can record events happening and send it anywhere they wish, or put it on their website. Non-profit and grassroots digital journalism sites may have far fewer resources than their corporate counterparts, yet due to digital media are able to have websites that are technically comparable.Kawamoto 2003, p. 15. Other media outlets can then pick up their story and run with it as they please, thus allowing information to reach wider audiences. For citizen journalism to be effective and successful, there needs to be citizen editors. Their role being to solicit other people to provide accurate information and to mediate interactivity among users. An example can be found in the start-up of the South Korean online daily newspaper, OhMyNews, where the founder recruited several hundred volunteer \\"citizen reporters\\" to write news articles that were edited and processed by four professional journalists.Bentley 2011, p. 107. News collections The Internet also offers options such as personalized news feeds and aggregators, which compile news from different websites into one site. One of the most popular news aggregators is Google News. Others include Topix.net, and TheFreeLibrary.com. But, some people see too much personalization as detrimental. For example, some fear that people will have narrower exposure to news, seeking out only those commentators who already agree with them. As of March 2005, Wikinews rewrites articles from other news organizations. Original reporting remains a challenge on the Internet as the burdens of verification and legal risks (especially from plaintiff-friendly jurisdictions like BC) remain high in the absence of any net-wide approach to defamation.O'Grady v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. Rptr. 3d 72, 139 Cal.App. 4th 1423, modified by O'Grady v. Superior Court, 140 Cal.App. 4th 675b, 2006.

Tata was already a major player in the heavy vehicle segment and the Estate was the company's first attempt at building a passenger car. The car was considered fairly advanced during its production time and had many features which were not common among other Indian cars available at the same price range then. The car came with power windows, power steering and a tachometer. The Estate's exterior is based on Mercedes-Benz station wagon design made at the time of conception, in particular the T-series estate-type cars. History The Tata Estate was introduced in 1992 and production ran until 2000. The Estate was powered by a Peugeot sourced 1.9-litre diesel engine producing at 4500 rpm and torque of at 2500 rpm, mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. The Estate followed after the production of the Tata Sierra in 1991. It was initially plagued with problems due to high fuel consumption, faulty electrical systems and suspensions before they were fixed in subsequent productions. Variants Tata Motors has mentioned that a bulletproof version of the Estate can be made for VIPs. Specifications The platform of the Estate was based on the Tata Telcoline pick-up truck, which saved the company around Rs. 10 crore (at that time) in development costs. Reception Gaadi rated the Tata Estate as the second station wagon that should be placed back into production since it was the car that made Tata known publicly.

Description The house was constructed out of stone dug out of the field in front of the house, and is decorated with gargoyles, gables and stained glass windows. It contains a collection of furniture, numerous carved stone fireplaces and Minton floor tiles, all of which were designed by the architect. The house is surrounded by of landscaped gardens, and is open to the public for four weeks each year. The house is Grade I listed, being an \\"outstanding early Tudor Revival house ...with excellent detail inside and out, the interior retaining almost all its original fittings.\\" It is also the earliest surviving major work by John Loughborough Pearson. History The house was built for Robert Raikes (1818–1901), grandson of banker Robert Raikes (1765–1837). Robert Raikes was a prominent member of the Oxford-based Christian Tractarian movement, and moved his family into the area in order to promote his beliefs and assist in the development of the area. The house was designed by John Loughborough Pearson, a young architect who was just beginning to experiment with the revived Gothic style of architecture. Pearson had already done some work for Raikes in the Hull area, including a chapel for his grandmother. Pearson was also asked by Raikes to modernise the church at Llangasty and build a school – both of which are at the end of the lane which leads down to Llangorse Lake. The church, considered a Tractarian gem, is still in use, but the school is now a private house. Pearson became a well-known architect – he designed Truro Cathedral among other well-known churches. Treberfydd's gardens were designed by W.A. Nesfield, an eminent Victorian gardener, who also designed the Pagoda Vista and Syon Vista at Kew Gardens, the Witley Court fountain and Castle Howard's South Lake. In 2007 Treberfydd was featured as the setting for \\"Human Nature\\" and \\"Family of Blood\\", episodes 8 and 9, of the BBC Wales series of Doctor Who. In 2012, the exterior of the house was featured in the Christmas Special of Dr Who starring Matt Smith. See also *List of non-ecclesiastical works by J. L.

It is one of a handful of sites that promote RPGs as an activity rather than advocating or supporting any specific game systems. The site was created in December 1995 by William J. Walton and has been regularly updated for more than a decade. Originally titled The Gaming Advocacy Website, it began as a research project for a technical writing class. In April 1996, the site was expanded into an online zine devoted to role-playing and collectible card games, and shortly after, the rest of the material was scrapped and the site focused entirely on gaming advocacy. Other examples of independent RPG Advocacy sites which have been cited in the media include the Shakespearean Eclectic Archive and the GAMA \\"Gaming & Education\\" site. Such sites counter the efforts of anti-game advocates including Patricia Pulling. When Ed Healy was helping the owners of the website Gaming Outpost with business development, he came up with the idea of creating a network of cobranded RPG sites, which would all feed into the Outpost; The Escapist soon came aboard but work stalled after that and Healy ultimately created Hephaestus' Forge.  Site self-description  From the site's main page: > Tabletop role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons are an engaging and > intellectually stimulating activity that promote teamwork, problem solving, > and creative thinking. Even better, in hands of a parent, guardian, or > educator, they can be a fantastic teaching tool. > > Unfortunately, the role-playing hobby has acquired a reputation for being > geeky, dangerous, occultic, satanic, and even causing players to be prone to > suicide or homicide. Only one of these is accurate — sure, it's a bit geeky, > but that's the worst thing that can be said about it. The rest of those > claims are pure urban legend.  Projects and features  The Escapist is dedicated to fighting misconceptions and misrepresentations about the RPG industry, and undoing damage caused by sensationalistic reporting and religious campaigns against the hobby. The Escapist contains several projects that are each devoted to a different aspect of roleplaying advocacy: * BeQuest, which focuses on connecting gamers, game clubs, and game companies with charitable organizations. * Reading, Writing, & Roleplaying, an upcoming project that focuses on using roleplaying games as an educational tool. * Terra Libris: The Library RPG Project, which encourages librarians and volunteers to organize and run role-playing games as Young Adult programs at libraries. * The Young Person's Adventure League, which focuses on getting children and pre-teens involved in the hobby. * The Square One Podcast, hosted by Sam Chupp and Bill Walton, a podcast geared towards new and inexperienced gamers. The site also has regular features of interest to the gaming community: * Tell Me About Your Character is a series of 'self-serve' interviews with roleplayers from all walks of life. * The Escapist Video Movie Review Report is a series of reviews of movies and television shows that feature roleplaying as part of the story — either based on published RPG worlds, or on gamers and the act of gaming. * 20 Sided World is an upcoming feature that explores gaming culture in different parts of the world.  Spellcasting 101  The most popular of the site's features is an installment of the editorial column Random Encounter titled Spellcasting 101: Don't Try This At Home. In it, the author attempts to test the claims made by many fundamentalist Christian groups and individuals that the Harry Potter books and Dungeons & Dragons game contain real magical rituals that will produce effects that can be reproduced. Numerous spells from both sources are put to the test, including Lumos, Body Bind, Burning Hands, Hold Portal, Spider Climb, and others. The purpose of the column was to point out the absurdity of the claims being made against different forms of fantasy entertainment. Initial response to the column was very favorable, with hundreds of approving emails arriving from all across the world, many of which were reprinted in the following installment of Random Encounter. Numerous websites linked to the column, including the Steve Jackson Games' Daily Illuminator and Harry Potter fansite The Leaky Cauldron. Forums and newsgroups devoted to role-playing games, Christianity, Wicca, and Paganism also helped to spread the word, and at least one half-hearted attempt at plagiarism appeared on the internet for a short while. The column is still the most- viewed page of the entire website, several years since its first appearance in 2002.  William J. Walton  The Escapist is Bill Walton's RPG advocacy site.

W. Bush administration. On July 20, 1989, the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, George H. W. Bush — then President of the United States — announced plans for what came to be known as the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). In a speech on the steps of the National Air and Space Museum he described plans calling for constructing Space Station Freedom, sending humans back to the Moon \\"to stay\\" and ultimately sending astronauts to explore Mars. He proposed not a 10-year Apollo-style plan, but a long-range continuing commitment based on the three above elements, ending with \\"a journey into tomorrow – a journey to another planet – a manned mission to Mars.\\" The President noted it was humanity's destiny to explore, and America's destiny to lead. He asked Vice President Dan Quayle to lead the National Space Council in determining what was needed to carry out these missions in terms of money, manpower and technology. In the event, execution of the initiative was assigned to NASA, but the initiative did not survive long into the administration of the next president, Bill Clinton. Background In August 1987 a committee chaired by former astronaut Dr. Sally Ride released a report entitled Leadership and America's Future in Space.* Hogan, Thor. Mars Wars: The Rise and Fall of the Space Exploration Initiative. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA History Division, Office of External Relations, 2007. Print. history.nasa.gov/sp4410.pdf The \\"Ride Report\\" advocated establishment of a permanent moon base by 2010 and landing a crew on Mars early in the 21st century. On January 5, 1988 President Ronald Reagan approved a revised United States national space policy, which was classified. On February 11 a summary \\"Fact Sheet\\" about the policy was publicly released. The policy identified six goals of United States space activities, the last of which was, \\"to expand human presence and activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.\\" In the view of NASA, the July 20, 1989 speech by President Bush, \\"provided specificity\\" to that policy goal. Following this announcement NASA Administrator Richard Truly initiated a study of the options to achieve the President's goals, headed by Johnson Space Center Director Aaron Cohen. A report on that study, called, \\"the 90-Day Study on Human Exploration of the Moon and Mars\\" (or simply, \\"the 90-Day Study\\"), was published by NASA on November 20, 1989. Development Mars mission design The 90-Day Study estimated SEI's long-term cost at approximately 500 billion dollars spread over 20 to 30 years. According to Steve Dick, NASA Chief Historian, the National Academy of Sciences largely concurred with the NASA study, but White House and Congressional reaction to the NASA plan was hostile, primarily due to the cost estimate. In particular, Democratic members of Congress had almost immediate criticism over Bush's plan. Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Jim Sasser, stated \\"The President took one giant leap for starry-eyed political rhetoric, and not even a small step for fiscal responsibility. The hard fact is, this Administration doesn't even have its space priorities established for next year, much less for the next century.\\" His fellow Tennessee Senator Al Gore also was quoted expressing his criticism of Bush's plan, saying \\"By proposing a return to the Moon, with no money, no timetable, and no plan, President Bush offers the country not a challenge to inspire us, but a daydream to briefly entertain us, a daydream about as splashy as a George Lucas movie, with about as much connection to reality.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/21/us/president-calls-for-mars- mission-and-a-moon-base.html President Bush sought international partners, but the program was thought too expensive even for an international endeavor. In August 1990, Vice President Quayle established an advisory committee, often called the \\"Augustine Commission\\", which recommended that NASA should focus on space and Earth science, and transition human exploration to a \\"go-as-you-pay\\" strategy. Ending On April 1, 1992 Dan Goldin became NASA Administrator, and during his tenure near-term human exploration beyond Earth orbit was abandoned, and the \\"faster, better, cheaper\\" strategy was applied to space science robotic exploration. When the White House National Science and Technology Council released their revision of the National Space Policy in September 1996, it specifically lacked any mention of human space exploration beyond Earth's orbit. The next day, President Clinton stated on a campaigning trip through the Pacific Northwest that a human mission to Mars was too expensive and instead affirmed America's commitment to a series of less expensive probes,Brian McGrory, \\"Clinton Curbs Mars Project: Drops Manned Mission, Backs Robotic Probes,\\" The Boston Globe (20 September 1996) thus removing human exploration from the national agenda. Projects =Space Station= Construction of Space Station Freedom. =Lunar Orbiter Missions= The Lunar Orbiter Missions would yield further information on the distribution of high-TiO regolith on the whole Moon, through gamma-ray spectroscopy. The purpose was stated to be to provide a detailed geochemical and mineralogical map of the Moon. Global stereo imaging to aid in site selection was also given as a function of the mission. =Common Lunar Lander program (CLL)= The CLL program would have consisted of a series of Apollo-type missions, mostly robotic. One mission was entitled Outpost Site Survey and Resource Assessment, involving the use of rovers. The site selected was in Mare Tranquillitatis near 15° N 22° E.Weaver, Dave. Artemis program: Rover/Mobility Systems Workshop results. Third SEI Technical Interchange: Proceedings p 49-57 (SEE N92-33309 24-12) This point is on the boundary between mare material and the ejecta blanket of the huge (45 km diameter) crater Plinius, on the east margin of a 25–40 km-wide band of material separating the ejecta blanket from highlands to the west. =First Lunar Outpost program (FLO)= The First Lunar Outpost (FLO) was the most comprehensive moon base study under the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI). It was intended to be the flagship of the program from which other proposals such as ILREC would have to compete against. The FLO concept incorporated many recommendations from the 1991 Stafford Synthesis report, mainly the use of a Nova class super heavy launch vehicle to minimize assembly and operations in LEO and on the surface of the Moon. FLO was a major change from previous SEI proposals as the vehicle was standalone and expendable rather than reusable and being staged off of Space Station Freedom. The design was based on massive yet simple launchers to carry massive amounts of payloads at once rather than many small and complicated launches. This was to reduce cost and development time. The program would have almost completely consisted of existing technology such as the Saturn and Space Station with the only the landing vehicle needing to be developed. = International Lunar Resource Exploration Concept = The International Lunar Resources Exploration Concept was a proposed mission architecture by Kent Joosten, an engineer at Johnson Space Center. The plan would have used the help of international partners, mainly Soviet Union, to assemble a lunar base and sustainable lunar transportation service. The plan would be a lunar surface rendezvous (LSR), where two vehicles would meet on the surface for refueling, rather than Apollo's Lunar orbit rendezvous (LOR). NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory proposed a LSR for Apollo but it was quickly turned down to the amount of technology, such as In situ resource utilization, that would need to be developed.

Chase was born with albinism and has severe visual impairment. Chase toured with American nu metal band Korn from 2006–2008. It was on tour with Korn in 2007 that he befriended Joey Jordison. He also performed on the 2007 MTV Unplugged release as a backup vocalist and multi-instrumentalist (donning a white rabbit mask). Vimic made their debut on SiriusXM in an interview with Joey Jordison on May 5, 2016. After touring the US in 2016 and embarking on a world tour in 2017, Vimic's debut album \\"Open Your Omen\\" was set to be released. As of August 2020, Chase was still hopeful the album would come out. After a career in metal and Vimic on indefinite hiatus, Chase officially returned to his singer-songwriter roots in 2020. The change in genre stemmed largely from conversations with record producer Kato Khandwala, whom he met while with Vimic. Prior to Khandwala's death in 2018 in a motorcycle accident, Chase had worked closely with the producer on his original material and was encouraged to pursue it. In March 2020, Chase wrote, recorded, and released solo acoustic single When the Sun Comes Up amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Motivation Suppose that G is a reductive group defined over a finite field, with Frobenius map F. Ian G. Macdonald conjectured that there should be a map from general position characters of F-stable maximal tori to irreducible representations of G^F (the fixed points of F). For general linear groups this was already known by the work of . This was the main result proved by Pierre Deligne and George Lusztig; they found a virtual representation for all characters of an F-stable maximal torus, which is irreducible (up to sign) when the character is in general position. When the maximal torus is split, these representations were well known and are given by parabolic induction of characters of the torus (extend the character to a Borel subgroup, then induce it up to G). The representations of parabolic induction can be constructed using functions on a space, which can be thought of as elements of a suitable zeroth cohomology group. Deligne and Lusztig's construction is a generalization of parabolic induction to non-split tori using higher cohomology groups. (Parabolic induction can also be done with tori of G replaced by Levi subgroups of G, and there is a generalization of Deligne–Lusztig theory to this case too.) Vladimir Drinfeld proved that the discrete series representations of SL2(Fq) can be found in the ℓ-adic cohomology groups :H^1_c(X, \\\\Q_{\\\\ell}) of the affine curve X defined by :xy^q-yx^q = 1. The polynomial xy^q-yx^q is a determinant used in the construction of the Dickson invariant of the general linear group, and is an invariant of the special linear group. The construction of Deligne and Lusztig is a generalization of this fundamental example to other groups. The affine curve X is generalized to a T^F bundle over a \\"Deligne–Lusztig variety\\" where T is a maximal torus of G, and instead of using just the first cohomology group they use an alternating sum of ℓ-adic cohomology groups with compact support to construct virtual representations. The Deligne-Lusztig construction is formally similar to Hermann Weyl's construction of the representations of a compact group from the characters of a maximal torus. The case of compact groups is easier partly because there is only one conjugacy class of maximal tori. The Borel–Weil–Bott construction of representations of algebraic groups using coherent sheaf cohomology is also similar. For real semisimple groups there is an analogue of the construction of Deligne and Lusztig, using Zuckerman functors to construct representations. Deligne–Lusztig varieties The construction of Deligne-Lusztig characters uses a family of auxiliary algebraic varieties XT called Deligne–Lusztig varieties, constructed from a reductive linear algebraic group G defined over a finite field Fq. If B is a Borel subgroup of G and T a maximal torus of B then we write :WT,B for the Weyl group (normalizer mod centralizer) :NG(T)/T of G with respect to T, together with the simple roots corresponding to B. If B1 is another Borel subgroup with maximal torus T1 then there is a canonical isomorphism from T to T1 that identifies the two Weyl groups. So we can identify all these Weyl groups, and call it 'the' Weyl group W of G. Similarly there is a canonical isomorphism between any two maximal tori with given choice of positive roots, so we can identify all these and call it 'the' maximal torus T of G. By the Bruhat decomposition :G = BWB, the subgroup B1 can be written as the conjugate of B by bw for some b∈B and w∈W (identified with WT,B) where w is uniquely determined. In this case we say that B and B1 are in relative position w. Suppose that w is in the Weyl group of G, and write X for the smooth projective variety of all Borel subgroups of G. The Deligne-Lusztig variety X(w) consists of all Borel subgroups B of G such that B and F(B) are in relative position w [recall that F is the Frobenius map]. In other words, it is the inverse image of the G-homogeneous space of pairs of Borel subgroups in relative position w, under the Lang isogeny with formula :g.F(g)−1. For example, if w=1 then X(w) is 0-dimensional and its points are the rational Borel subgroups of G. We let T(w) be the torus T, with the rational structure for which the Frobenius is wF. The GF conjugacy classes of F-stable maximal tori of G can be identified with the F-conjugacy classes of W, where we say w∈W is F-conjugate to elements of the form vwF(v)−1 for v∈W. If the group G is split, so that F acts trivially on W, this is the same as ordinary conjugacy, but in general for non-split groups G, F may act on W via a non-trivial diagram automorphism. The F-stable conjugacy classes can be identified with elements of the non-abelian Galois cohomology group of torsors :H^1(F,W). Fix a maximal torus T of G and a Borel subgroup B containing it, both invariant under the Frobenius map F, and write U for the unipotent radical of B. If we choose a representative w′ of the normalizer N(T) representing w, then we define X′(w′) to be the elements of G/U with F(u)=uw′. This is acted on freely by T(F), and the quotient is isomorphic to X(T). So for each character θ of T(w)F we get a corresponding local system Fθ on X(w). The Deligne-Lusztig virtual representation :Rθ(w) of GF is defined by the alternating sum :R^\\\\theta(w) = \\\\sum_i(-1)^iH_c^i(X(w),F_\\\\theta) of l-adic compactly supported cohomology groups of X(w) with coefficients in the l-adic local system Fθ. If T is a maximal F-invariant torus of G contained in a Borel subgroup B such that B and FB are in relative position w then Rθ(w) is also denoted by RθT⊂B, or by RθT as up to isomorphism it does not depend on the choice of B. Properties of Deligne–Lusztig characters * The character of RθT does not depend on the choice of prime l≠p, and if θ=1 its values are rational integers. * Every irreducible character of GF occurs in at least one character Rθ(w). * The inner product of RθT and Rθ′T′ is equal to the number of elements of W(T,T′)F taking θ to θ′. The set W(T,T′) is the set of elements of G taking T to T′ under conjugation, modulo the group TF which acts on it in the obvious way (so if T=T′ it is the Weyl group). In particular the inner product is 0 if w and w′ are not F-conjugate. If θ is in general position then RθT has norm 1 and is therefore an irreducible character up to sign. So this verifies Macdonald's conjecture. * The representation RθT contains the trivial representation if and only if θ=1 (in which case the trivial representation occurs exactly once). * The representation RθT has dimension :\\\\dim(R^\\\\theta_{T})= {\\\\pmG^F \\\\over T^FU^F} :where UF is a Sylow p-subgroup of GF, of order the largest power of p dividing GF. * The restriction of the character RθT to unipotent elements u does not depend on θ and is called a Green function, denoted by QT,G(u) (the Green function is defined to be 0 on elements that are not unipotent). The character formula gives the character of RθT in terms of Green functions of subgroups as follows: :R^\\\\theta_T(x) = {1\\\\over G_s^F}\\\\sum_{g\\\\in G^F, g^{-1}sg\\\\in T} Q_{gTg^{-1},G_s}(u)\\\\theta(g^{-1}sg) :where x=su is the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition of x as the product of commuting semisimple and unipotent elements s and u, and Gs is the identity component of the centralizer of s in G. In particular the character value vanishes unless the semisimple part of x is conjugate under GF to something in the torus T. * The Deligne-Lusztig variety is usually affine, in particular whenever the characteristic p is larger than the Coxeter number h of the Weyl group. If it is affine and the character θ is in general position (so that the Deligne-Lusztig character is irreducible up to sign) then only one of the cohomology groups Hi(X(w),Fθ) is non-zero (the one with i equal to the length of w) so this cohomology group gives a model for the irreducible representation. In general it is possible for more than one cohomology group to be non-zero, for example when θ is 1. Lusztig's classification of irreducible characters Lusztig classified all the irreducible characters of GF by decomposing such a character into a semisimple character and a unipotent character (of another group) and separately classifying the semisimple and unipotent characters. =The dual group= The representations of GF are classified using conjugacy classes of the dual group of G. A reductive group over a finite field determines a root datum (with choice of Weyl chamber) together with an action of the Frobenius element on it. The dual group G* of a reductive algebraic group G defined over a finite field is the one with dual root datum (and adjoint Frobenius action). This is similar to the Langlands dual group (or L-group), except here the dual group is defined over a finite field rather than over the complex numbers. The dual group has the same root system, except that root systems of type B and C get exchanged. The local Langlands conjectures state (very roughly) that representations of an algebraic group over a local field should be closely related to conjugacy classes in the Langlands dual group. Lusztig's classification of representations of reductive groups over finite fields can be thought of as a verification of an analogue of this conjecture for finite fields (though Langlands never stated his conjecture for this case). =Jordan decomposition= In this section G will be a reductive group with connected center. An irreducible character is called unipotent if it occurs in some R1T, and is called semisimple if its average value on regular unipotent elements is non-zero (in which case the average value is 1 or −1). If p is a good prime for G (meaning that it does not divide any of the coefficients of roots expressed as linear combinations of simple roots) then an irreducible character is semisimple if and only if its order is not divisible by p. An arbitrary irreducible character has a \\"Jordan decomposition\\": to it one can associate a semisimple character (corresponding to some semisimple element s of the dual group), and a unipotent representation of the centralizer of s. The dimension of the irreducible character is the product of the dimensions of its semisimple and unipotent components. This (more or less) reduces the classification of irreducible characters to the problem of finding the semisimple and the unipotent characters. =Geometric conjugacy= Two pairs (T,θ), (T′,θ′) of a maximal torus T of G fixed by F and a character θ of TF are called geometrically conjugate if they are conjugate under some element of G(k), where k is the algebraic closure of Fq. If an irreducible representation occurs in both RTθ and RT′θ′ then (T,θ), (T′,θ′) need not be conjugate under GF, but are always geometrically conjugate. For example, if θ = θ′ = 1 and T and T′ are not conjugate, then the identity representation occurs in both Deligne–Lusztig characters, and the corresponding pairs (T,1), (T′,1) are geometrically conjugate but not conjugate. The geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (T,θ) are parameterized by geometric conjugacy classes of semisimple elements s of the group G*F of elements of the dual group G* fixed by F. Two elements of G*F are called geometrically conjugate if they are conjugate over the algebraic closure of the finite field; if the center of G is connected this is equivalent to conjugacy in G*F. The number of geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (T,θ) is Z0Fql where Z0 is the identity component of the center Z of G and l is the semisimple rank of G. =Classification of semisimple characters= In this subsection G will be a reductive group with connected center Z. (The case when the center is not connected has some extra complications.) The semisimple characters of G correspond to geometric conjugacy classes of pairs (T,θ) (where T is a maximal torus invariant under F and θ is a character of TF); in fact among the irreducible characters occurring in the Deligne–Lusztig characters of a geometric conjugacy class there is exactly one semisimple character. If the center of G is connected there are ZFql semisimple characters. If κ is a geometric conjugacy class of pairs (T,θ) then the character of the corresponding semisimple representation is given up to sign by :\\\\sum_{(T,\\\\theta)\\\\in \\\\kappa, \\\\bmod G^F} {R_T^\\\\theta\\\\over (R_T^\\\\theta,R_T^\\\\theta)} and its dimension is the p′ part of the index of the centralizer of the element s of the dual group corresponding to it. The semisimple characters are (up to sign) exactly the duals of the regular characters, under Alvis–Curtis duality, a duality operation on generalized characters. An irreducible character is called regular if it occurs in the Gelfand–Graev representation GF, which is the representation induced from a certain \\"non-degenerate\\" 1-dimensional character of the Sylow p-subgroup. It is reducible, and any irreducible character of GF occurs at most once in it. If κ is a geometric conjugacy class of pairs (T,θ) then the character of the corresponding regular representation is given by :\\\\sum_{(T,\\\\theta)\\\\in \\\\kappa, \\\\bmod G^F} {\\\\epsilon_G\\\\epsilon_TR_T^\\\\theta\\\\over (R_T^\\\\theta,R_T^\\\\theta)} and its dimension is the p′ part of the index of the centralizer of the element s of the dual group corresponding to it times the p-part of the order of the centralizer. =Classification of unipotent characters= These can be found from the cuspidal unipotent characters: those that cannot be obtained from decomposition of parabolically induced characters of smaller rank groups. The unipotent cuspidal characters were listed by Lusztig using rather complicated arguments. The number of them depends only on the type of the group and not on the underlying field; and is given as follows: * none for groups of type An; * none for groups of type 2An, unless n = s(s+1)/2–1 for some s, in which case there is one; * none for groups of type Bn or Cn, unless n = s(s+1) for some s, in which case there is one (called θ10 when n = 2); * 2 for Suzuki groups of type 2B2; * none for groups of type Dn, unless n = s2 for some even s, in which case there is one; * none for groups of type 2Dn, unless n = s2 for some odd s, in which case there is one; * 2 for groups of type 3D6; * 2 for groups of type E6; * 3 for groups of type 2E6; * 2 for groups of type E7; * 13 for groups of type E8; * 7 for groups of type F4; * 10 for Ree groups of type 2F4; * 4 for groups of type G2; * 6 for Ree groups of type 2G2. The unipotent characters can be found by decomposing the characters induced from the cuspidal ones, using results of Howlett and Lehrer. The number of unipotent characters depends only on the root system of the group and not on the field (or the center). The dimension of the unipotent characters can be given by universal polynomials in the order of the ground field depending only on the root system; for example the Steinberg representation has dimension qr, where r is the number of positive roots of the root system. Lusztig discovered that the unipotent characters of a group GF (with irreducible Weyl group) fall into families of size 4n (n ≥ 0), 8, 21, or 39. The characters of each family are indexed by conjugacy classes of pairs (x,σ) where x is in one of the groups Z/2Zn, S3, S4, S5 respectively, and σ is a representation of its centralizer. (The family of size 39 only occurs for groups of type E8, and the family of size 21 only occurs for groups of type F4.) The families are in turn indexed by special representations of the Weyl group, or equivalently by 2-sided cells of the Weyl group. For example, the group E8(Fq) has 46 families of unipotent characters corresponding to the 46 special representations of the Weyl group of E8. There are 23 families with 1 character, 18 families with 4 characters, 4 families with 8 characters, and one family with 39 characters (which includes the 13 cuspidal unipotent characters). Examples Suppose that q is an odd prime power, and G is the algebraic group SL2. We describe the Deligne–Lusztig representations of the group SL2(Fq). (The representation theory of these groups was well known long before Deligne–Lusztig theory.) The irreducible representations are: * The trivial representation of dimension 1. * The Steinberg representation of dimension q * The (q − 3)/2 irreducible principal series representations of dimension q + 1, together with 2 representations of dimension (q + 1)/2 coming from a reducible principal series representation. * The (q − 1)/2 irreducible discrete series representations of dimension q − 1, together with 2 representations of dimension (q − 1)/2 coming from a reducible discrete series representation. There are two classes of tori associated to the two elements (or conjugacy classes) of the Weyl group, denoted by T(1) (cyclic of order q−1) and T(w) (cyclic of order q + 1). The non-trivial element of the Weyl group acts on the characters of these tori by changing each character to its inverse. So the Weyl group fixes a character if and only if it has order 1 or 2. By the orthogonality formula, Rθ(w) is (up to sign) irreducible if θ does not have order 1 or 2, and a sum of two irreducible representations if it has order 1 or 2. The Deligne-Lusztig variety X(1) for the split torus is 0-dimensional with q+1 points, and can be identified with the points of 1-dimensional projective space defined over Fq. The representations Rθ(1) are given as follows: * 1+Steinberg if θ=1 * The sum of the 2 representations of dimension (q+1)/2 if θ has order 2. * An irreducible principal series representation if θ has order greater than 2. The Deligne-Lusztig variety X(w) for the non-split torus is 1-dimensional, and can be identified with the complement of X(1) in 1-dimensional projective space. So it is the set of points (x:y) of projective space not fixed by the Frobenius map (x:y)→ (xq:yq), in other words the points with :xy^q-yx^q e 0 Drinfeld's variety of points (x,y) of affine space with :xy^q-yx^q=1 maps to X(w) in the obvious way, and is acted on freely by the group of q+1th roots λ of 1 (which can be identified with the elements of the non-split torus that are defined over Fq), with λ taking (x,y) to (λx,λy). The Deligne Lusztig variety is the quotient of Drinfeld's variety by this group action. The representations −Rθ(w) are given as follows: * Steinberg−1 if θ=1 * The sum of the 2 representations of dimension (q−1)/2 if θ has order 2. * An irreducible discrete series representation if θ has order greater than 2. The unipotent representations are the trivial representation and the Steinberg representation, and the semisimple representations are all the representations other than the Steinberg representation. (In this case the semisimple representations do not correspond exactly to geometric conjugacy classes of the dual group, as the center of G is not connected.) Intersection cohomology and character sheaves replaced the ℓ-adic cohomology used to define the Deligne-Lusztig representations with intersection ℓ-adic cohomology, and introduced certain perverse sheaves called character sheaves. The representations defined using intersection cohomology are related to those defined using ordinary cohomology by Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials. The F-invariant irreducible character sheaves are closely related to the irreducible characters of the group GF. References * .   .  * * , Adv. Math., 57 (1985) 226–265; Adv.

In 1982, it and nearby Marta Island were declared a national monument—Los Pingüinos Natural Monument. The island is the breeding location for several species of seabirds, most notably the Magellanic penguin. The penguin colony on the island has been monitored since 1998 and was estimated to hold 63,000 breeding pairs in 2007. With the exception of the Park Rangers, the island is currently uninhabited. Penguin Population Penguins on Magdalena Island have declined for different reasons. Current data indicate that tourism is not the cause of the decline, and even has a minor role in improving breeding success for a few hundred penguins nesting alongside the tourist path. The main predator of penguin chicks on Magdalena Island is the Skua (Stercorarius chilensis). The skua is very shy and avoids areas frequented by tourists. A reduction in the abundance of the skua decreases the mortality of chicks and increases the breeding success of the penguins. Penguin populations stood at 59,000 breeding pairs in 2000/01, 63,000 pairs in 2008/09, and 43,000 pairs in 2018/19. In 2009 and 2010 the island suffered a severe drought that killed off all the vegetation leaving just bare soil. Without vegetation, the wind caused loose soil to be blown across the island, covering and burying burrows, eggs and chicks. This caused very low breeding success, and reduced the available nesting area of the island. As a result in the reduction of suitable breeding area, the penguin population has declined to 43,000 pairs by 2018/19. with many penguins moving to the nearby colony at Cabo Virgenes in Argentina (Bingham 2020).

Danish forces of Christian IV of Denmark-Norway had made landfall on Usedom and the adjacent mainland, and expelled the imperial occupation forces. An Imperial army commanded by Albrecht von Wallenstein left besieged Stralsund to confront Christian IV.Findeisen (1998), p.474 Ultimately, the Danish forces were defeated.Beller (1928), p. 536. Christian IV and a faction of his landing force were able to escape by ship. Prelude Christian IV of Denmark-Norway had started the Danish-Norwegian intervention in the Thirty Years' War by invading the Holy Roman Empire in 1625.Mackillop (2003), p.12 Initially successful, he suffered setbacks when his armies were defeated in the battles of Dessau Bridge and Lutter am Barenberge in 1626.Press (1991), p.203 In the following months, the Danish armies were forced to abandon their gains on Imperial soil and parts of Denmark herself, and retreated to the Danish isles while the Imperial army of Albrecht von Wallenstein subsequently occupied the North German plain. The Duchy of Pomerania, which included Wolgast, capitulated to the Empire at Franzburg in November 1627. The Baltic Sea, however, remained under Danish control, due to the lack of an imperial navy.Langer (2003), p.402 The Emperor Ferdinand II gave Wallenstein the Duchy of Mecklenburg in January, and promoted him \\"General of the Oceanic and Baltic Seas\\" in April 1628. Together with Spain, Wallenstein made plans for a Baltic imperial navy.Press (1991), pp.203-204 Denmark and Sweden reacted by concluding an alliance, also in April.Lockhart (2007), p.170 The Pomeranian port of Stralsund, some 70 kilometers west of Wolgast, refused to accept the Capitulation of Franzburg and with Danish and Swedish support successfully resisted Wallenstein's siege.Press (1991), p.213 In addition to the support for Stralsund, Christian IV had resorted to a strategy of amphibious ambushes, using his naval superiority to make landfalls on Fehmarn and in Eckernförde, and destroying the naval facilities in Ålborg, Greifswald and Wismar - all in imperial hands.Lockhart (2007), p.169 Battle Christian IV of Denmark- Norway with his navy.

On 11 August,Guthrie (2002), p.143 Christian IV of Denmark-Norway with 7,000 troopsGebhardt (2001), p.229 landed on Usedom, separated from the town of Wolgast by the Peenestrom sound, and occupied the island.Heitz (1995), p.219 At the mouth of the sound, the Imperial occupation forces since February had constructed a sconce at Peenemünde, which was taken by Christian IV's troops.The sconce would be taken by the Swedish landing forces in 1630, and thus is called Schwedenschanze- Swedish sconce. Sinnwell (2003), p.59Sinnwell (2003), p.59 On 14 August (O.S.)/24 August (N.S.), they took over Wolgast meeting no resistance. After the Imperial garrison was expelled, Christian IV was met by an overwhelming support of the local population to turn Wolgast into a fortress like Stralsund. Reinforcements were on their way from Sweden. Christian IV then awaited Wallenstein, who withdrew from the siege of Stralsund and was heading east to face the Danish force. The battlefield Christian had chosen was half a mile west of the town, secured by the coast and marshes. Christian IV had 5,000-6,000 troops on the battlefield, including 1,500 cavalry and some 400 Scots from the Donald Mackay regiment, and the infantry organized in six regiments.Guthrie (2002), p.144 Wallenstein advanced with a force of 7,000-8,000 troops, consisting of 33 infantry companies, 20 cuirassier companies, and 11 guns. Wallenstein attacked on 22 August (O.S.) / 2 September (N.S.). He wiped out the Danish flank, killing 1,000 of Christian IV's troops and capturing another 600. Thereafter, he was able to retake the town, where 500 Danish troops were now isolated from the main army and had no choice but to surrender. Thereby, Wolgast with its residence of the Pomeranian dukes was badly burned and looted.Wartenberg (2008), p.31 Only nightfall allowed for Christian IV and some of his troops to retreat and board their vessels. Aftermath Albrecht von Wallenstein on horseback =Analysis= The battle was the last one between Christian IV and the Holy Roman Empire.Heckel (1983), p.143 The defeat at Wolgast, ending the most ambitious operation of the Danish 1628 amphibious assault series, was the decisive factor that led Christian IV to negotiate the Peace of Lübeck with Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor.Bedürftig (1998), p.138 On the other hand, Wallenstein also needed a peace: The campaigns of Christian IV succeeded to keep Imperial forces busy that were needed elsewhere, and with respect to Denmark, this was a major intent behind the assaults. Furthermore, the Dano- Swedish alliance that took shape was a threat to Wallenstein's North German gains. After Albrecht von Wallenstein had lost much of his reputation in the Siege of Stralsund,Lee (2002), p.25 the victory at Wolgast postponed his dismissal.Albrecht (1998), p.688 Though Ferdinand II had Ramboldo, Count of Collalto reduce Wallenstein's army, the passage about his dismissal was stricken out. =Peace of Lübeck= The Peace of Lübeck then basically returned to Christian IV his pre-war possessions, while he had to pledge not to intervene in the empire again. =Sweden invades Pomerania= In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden started the Swedish invasion of the Holy Roman Empire, landing on Usedom near Wolgast - in the same spot as Christian IV did before. The Imperial defenders of Wolgast, in charge since the battle of 1628, were defeated on 7 August 1630 in the town, and on 25 August in the castle of Wolgast.Ehrle (1983), p.161 While his success was longer lasting, he would return to Wolgast on 15 July 1633 in a casket, when his body was embarked for the final transfer to Sweden.Findeisen (1998), p.367 See also *List of battles *Thirty Years' War *Capitulation of Franzburg *Siege of Stralsund (1628) *Pomerania during the Early Modern Age Notes Sources =References= =Bibliography=      * * Category:Battles involving Denmark Category:Battles involving the Holy Roman Empire Category:Battles of the Thirty Years' War Category:Conflicts in 1628 Category:1628 in Denmark Category:Albrecht von Wallenstein ","title":"Battle of Wolgast"},{"id":"10574912","text":"The Hellcats, also known as Biker Babes, is a 1968 outlaw biker film starring Ross Hagen and directed by Robert F. Slatzer. It was featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 as the 9th episode of season two. Plot As the film opens, a motorcycle gang called the Hellcats is burying their deceased leader, Big Daddy, while being watched from a distance by two groups. One group consists of Detective Dave Chapman and his partner, who have been monitoring the Hellcats and their criminal activity. The other group is mobster Mr. Adrian and his henchmen. Adrian uses the Hellcats to move narcotics from Mexico into California, and, unknown to the gang, had Big Daddy killed after learning he was an informant for Chapman. Adrian and his goons decide to kill Chapman to end his investigation, and a sniper murders him on a romantic day out with his fiancee, Linda. Following this, Dave's brother Monte, a sergeant in the United States Army, returns from active duty only to learn of his brother's death. Linda and Monte learn of the Hellcats from Dave's notes and decide to get revenge. Posing as a biker couple, they meet the Hellcats at their usual hangout, a dive bar called \\"Moonfire Inn.\\" Monte has difficulty getting respect from the gang's new leader, Snake, but adopts a gruff, defensive attitude that seems to impress Sheila, the driving force of the Hellcats and their contact with Adrian. Monte and Linda watch a drunken gang party from the sidelines, looking for chances to gather information. One of Adrian's henchmen comes in with orders for Sheila from Adrian. When he turns aggressive after being rejected by Sheila, Monte comes to her rescue and manages to get a look at the note with Sheila's orders, learning that the drugs originate in Mexico. The gang takes the party to the country, where they continue to drink, dance, and take drugs. A rival gang arrives and their leader challenges Snake to a bike race which devolves into a brawl. After Monte stops the brawl, the Hellcats question his toughness. To stay in their good graces, he accepts a test of endurance with Snake: Each man is tied by his feet to an all terrain vehicle while he holds onto a bar tied to another ATV. Both riders engage their engines and the man must last at least fifteen seconds being pulled between the two. Snake loses, and Monte gains the respect of the gang and has sex with Sheila. While this is going on, Linda retreats to the main party area and is offered heroin by Six-Pack. With hard evidence of the Hellcats' drug running, Linda accepts an invitation from Sheila to join her on her ride to pick up more drugs from their supplier, a man named Scorpio. Sheila, Linda, and Betty meet Scorpio at night and hide the drugs behind the headlights of their motorcycles. On the way back to Moonfire Inn, they are pursued by a cop car. After splitting up, Betty is followed and drives into a ditch, dying on impact. Sheila reports the news to Adrian, who demands the Hellcats retrieve the drugs hidden in Betty's bike, which has now been impounded by the police. Sheila orders Moongoose to retrieve it, but he's caught by the police and arrested. Sheila drives to Adrian's headquarters, followed by Linda, who in turn is followed by Monte. Hearing that the police have captured a gang member and found the heroin, Adrian flies into a rage and prepares to flee to Tahiti. When Sheila and Linda arrive, Adrian, further infuriated to learn that Sheila had allowed herself to be followed, has Sheila tied up in the shop room and beaten while he attempts to seduce Linda. Monte arrives and is captured by Adrian's henchmen. They beat him and tie him up in the shop room next to Sheila. Linda pretends to be interested in Adrian's advances while Sheila finds a Dremel tool, which she uses to cut Monte's bonds. He unties her and goes to rescue Linda, only to be apprehended again. Sheila runs to a payphone, where she calls the other Hellcats for help. Adrian and his henchmen take Linda and Monte to the docks, where they are thrown into a garbage barge to die. Adrian's escape is delayed due to issues with his boat and the Hellcats arrive before he has a chance to leave. The gang assaults Adrian and his underlings and free Monte and Linda as sirens blare. Later, Monte and Linda prepare to leave town separately. The Hellcats have been arrested for their role in the drug ring, but Monte hopes that Mongoose's confession will spare the gang too harsh a sentence. Linda drives off in her car as Monte rides his motorcycle into the distance. Cast * Ross Hagen as Monte Chapman * Dee Duffy as Linda * Sharyn Kinzie as Sheila * Robert F.

Born in London, Whitfield was the younger son of John Henry Christopher Whitfield and his wife Louisa (née Farren). He was educated at Archbishop Tenison's Grammar School, University College School, and at Vienna and London universities. He at first worked in Vienna but in his early twenties his sight began to deteriorate. This forced him to prepare for a new vocation, which led him into a career as a violinist. He made his professional soloist debut in 1913, by then almost completely blind. He later came into contact with Sir Arthur Pearson, the founder of the charity organisation St Dunstan's, and joined the St Dunstan's Blind Musicians Concert Party. Whitfield made his mark as an accomplished violinist in the early 1920s, but ill health later forced him to restrict his concert engagements. He then took up the study of economics, political science and philosophy, and obtained a B.Sc. in 1926 and a Ph.D. in 1928. The latter year he was elected to the Executive Council of the National Institute for the Blind. In 1935 he injured a hand and was forced to abandon his music career.

Real Shit ; Are MadVillain on Last.fm Music video The video, directed and animated by James Reitano for TFU Studios, is in the form of an animated Silver Age comic book. It begins with two scientists in a lab experimenting with chemicals. Their work goes awry when a mixture fills the lab with gas, and the scientists, locked in by a supposed security guard, begin to mutate. One grows into a huge man-monster called \\"Madvillain\\" and dons an MF Doom mask while the other shrinks into a purple alien-like creature with telepathic powers. He is encased in a golden casket-like case, and they both manage to escape the lab. The \\"title page\\" then appears, along with a seal bearing Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's names, and Madvillain, now wearing a suit with a green trenchcoat and brown hat, carries the golden case until he is confronted by a gang of men in suits called \\"The Minions of Death.\\" They seem to be after the golden case, but the man-monster doesn't surrender it without a fight. Using a laser rifle, the Minions manage to capture the golden case and subdue Madvillain. Back at their hideout, the Minions demand Madvillain to open the case by force. The alien scientist awakens, and the man-monster hears his thoughts, giving him a boost of energy to let them both escape the hideout. The video ends with a high-speed chase in the mountains with the Minions pursuing the mutated scientists. After they fire a few shots, the alien tells the man-monster to speed up.

It tells the story of aging rock singer Hoss, doing battle with rival Crow. Plot The play is set in a vaguely described science fiction future dominated by \\"The Game,\\" a conflation of rock music and violence played by \\"Markers\\" under the direction of \\"The Keepers.\\" Hoss has struggled to become the top Marker, only to find himself doubting his own abilities in the face of opposition from \\"Gypsies\\" who operate outside of the official rules. Act 1: Eager to make an outing, Hoss is frustrated when the Star-Man advises him against it on the basis of his astrology. Hoss learns that his rival, Mojo Root Force, has encroached upon his territory in Las Vegas in a move of questionable legality. After getting word that a Gypsy from Vegas is on his way to attack him, Hoss calls an old friend, Little Willard, for backup, only to find that Willard has committed suicide due to his inability to cope with his status. These successive revelations exacerbate Hoss's self-doubt and his belief that the old way is dying, and he attempts to perk up his confidence by challenging the Gypsy to a shiv fight. Act II: Before the duel (which has been changed from a shiv fight to battle of words under the guidance of an official referee) Hoss and Crow attempt to psych each other out. While Crow learns to imitate Hoss's walk and style, Hoss intimidates Crow by taking on the voice of an old Western gunslinger. Despite an ostensibly effective second round in which he takes on the voice of a Delta bluesman, Hoss loses the battle when Crow exposes Hoss's \\"Fear that he's crackin' busted in two.\\"Shepard 241 After killing the Ref, a desperate Hoss begs Crow to teach him the new style. Ultimately, however, he decides to commit his last authentic act by killing himself, for which Crow commends him. The play ends with Crow assuming his place on Hoss' throne, with Becky quickly shifting her loyalty. Characters Hoss – The world's top Marker, he is worried that the younger Gypsies are aiming to usurp his position. He often takes on the dialects of past myths, such as a Western gunfighter, a 1920s gangster, and a Delta blues singer. He resembles \\"a mean Rip Torn.\\"Shepard 203 Crow – An upstart Gypsie Marker seeking to dethrone Hoss. He constantly speaks in a stylish, newfangled dialect. He is described as looking like The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Becky Lou – Hoss's girlfriend/manager. Star-Man – An astrologer who advises Hoss. Galactic Jack – A disc jockey who advises Hoss by looking in the charts. He dresses like a pimp and speaks like Wolfman Jack. Cheyenne Hoss's driver and friend. Doc Hoss's drug supplier/physician.

The Tooth of Crime had its American premiere at the McCarter Theater in November 1972. In 1996, Shepard revised the play as Tooth of Crime: Second Dance (minus \\"The\\"), and the score was rewritten by T-Bone Burnett. This version premiered in December 1996 at the Lucille Lortel Theater in Manhattan, directed by Bill Hart, and starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Kirk Acevedo. The New York Times' Ben Brantley questioned \\"if Mr. Shepard's changes in the script improve or mar it.\\" The original script was revived in 2006 for a production at LaMama E.T.C. (La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club), in New York, as part of La MaMa's 45th-anniversary season. Directed by George Ferencz, it was a restaging of Ferencz's 1983 concert-style production, using many of the same cast members.

Established in 1954 as Balgowlah Boys High School, the campus enrolled approximately 900 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom one percent identified as Indigenous Australians and 28 percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education in accordance with a curriculum developed by the New South Wales Education Standards Authority; the principal is Paul Sheather. Overview Balgowlah Boys Campus is a part of the Northern Beaches Secondary College, a five-campus college across Sydney's Northern Beaches, formed in 2003. The school was previously known as Balgowlah Boys High School. Balgowlah Boys Campus also has a sister school Mackellar Girls Campus, located in . The school has engineered significant cultural change in the past few years under the stewardship of Dean White and Paul Sheather. Once known as a bastion of Northern Beaches sporting success, and rarely acknowledged for its academic prowess, Balgowlah Boys Secondary Campus has emerged as an academic leader in NSW in recent years, leading the state in 'value added' literacy improvement in NAPLAN testing 2009, and maintaining this development through to the HSC. In 2011, Balgowlah Boys Secondary Campus achieved its best-ever HSC results, continuing a surge through state school ranking system that began in 2010. Students achieved significant success across all subject areas, particularly in English, Visual Arts, Mathematics, Industrial Technology and Ancient History. Notably, Balgowlah Boys Campus placed 1st in NSW among comprehensive boys' schools for English. This included Merit List success in consecutive years for Advanced English and English Extension 1. In the 2012 HSC, Balgowlah Boys campus retained its place as the top comprehensive school in the NSW for English and 41st in the state overall. Remarkably, this placed them well above a number of selective schools, including Penrith, Girraween and Gosford, as well as numerous private institutions. Analysis of statistical data suggests the recent success of the school is largely due to the innovative, energetic and collaborative pedagogical philosophy of the teaching staff and executive. The increasingly aspirational culture of the school appears to challenge the contumacious adherence to egalitarianism that promotes mediocrity in the government school system, while simultaneously embracing a brand of boys' education which values diverse forms of achievement in both traditional and vocational learning.

His books, in particular the crime series around forensic anthropologist Dr David Hunter, have sold 21 million of copies worldwide, and enjoyed particular success in Germany and Scandinavia. Life and works Simon Beckett was born on 20 April 1960 in Sheffield, England, UK, to a working-class background. After earning a Master of Arts degree in English, Beckett taught in Spain and played in several bands before becoming a freelance journalist. He has written for The Times, The Independent on Sunday, The Daily Telegraph and The Observer, amongst others. He wrote several novels, including Fine Lines in 1994, before publishing the first novel in the David Hunter series, The Chemistry of Death, in 2006. A crime novel centred on a forensic anthropologist, Dr David Hunter, as the protagonist, The Chemistry of Death was shortlisted for the 2006 Gold Dagger award. Sequel novels featuring David Hunter have been released in August 2007 (Written in Bone), January 2009 (Whispers of the Dead), 2010 (The Calling of the Grave) and 2017 (The Restless Dead). The series has sold several million copies worldwide and is particularly popular in Germany and Scandinavia. The books and protagonist were inspired when Beckett visited the \\"Body Farm\\" (by its official name: the University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility, founded by forensic anthropology pioneer Dr Bill Bass) in 2002, doing research for an article for the Daily Telegraph. Having watched—and participated in—\\"live\\" exercises involving manufactured crime scenes containing real decaying corpses, and having witnessed the sciences employed to ascertain how, when and where death occurred, Beckett was inspired to create a central character who is, in his own words, \\"vulnerable\\" and \\"very human\\", while authoritative and knowledgeable regarding forensic anthropology. Simon Beckett is married and currently lives in Sheffield, England. Beckett's novels are very popular in Europe; by 2010 he had sold over four million books outside of the United Kingdom and in the same year had outsold J K Rowling and Ian McEwan in Continental Europe. In February 2019, he was presented with a Ripper Award (the European Prize from Criminal Literature). He received the award jointly with novelist Arne Dahl as they both received the same amount of public vote. In March 2020, Trapeze Books announced that Beckett had signed a two-book deal with them to release the new Jonah Colley series which revolves around a police officer from the Metropolitan Police in London. The first book, titled The Lost, will be released in July 2021.

During the Yuan dynasty the Jurchen peoples in northern Korea were ruled by Korean administrators appointed by the Yuan Dynasty court. The Korean Kingdoms of Goryeo and its successor Joseon fought their way up the Korean peninsula and annexed land from the Jurchen, culminating in Joseon taking total control of the Korean peninsula after seizing control of Hamgyong (鹹鏡道/함경도) from the Jurchens. According to the Goryeosa, in 918, the ancient capital of Pyongyang had been in ruins for a long time and foreign barbarians were using the surrounding lands as hunting grounds and occasionally raiding the borders of Goryeo; therefore, Wang Geon ordered his subjects to repopulate the ancient capital,\\"丙申谕群臣曰:“平壤古都荒废虽久,基址尙存,而荆棘滋茂,蕃人游猎於其间,因而侵掠边邑,为害 大矣。 宜徙民实之以固藩屏为百世之利\\"(高丽史) and soon thereafter sent his cousin Wang Sik-ryeom to defend it. In 993, the land between the border of Liao and Goryeo was occupied by troublesome Jurchen tribes, but the Goryeo diplomat Seo Hui was able to negotiate with Liao and obtain that land up to the Yalu River, citing that in the past it belonged to Goguryeo, the predecessor to Goryeo., p.64: \\"By the end of the negotiation, Sô Hûi had ... ostensibly for the purpose of securing safe diplomatic passage, obtained an explicit Khitan consent to incorporate the land between the Ch’ôngch’ôn and Amnok Rivers into Koryô territory.\\"“自契丹东京至我安北府数百里之地,皆为生女真所据。光宗取之,筑嘉州、松城等城,今契丹之来,其志不过取 北二城,其声言取高勾丽旧地者,实恐我也”(高丽史) Both Balhae remnants and miscellaneous tribal peoples like Jurchens lived in the area between the Yalu and Taedong which was targeted for annexation by Goryeo.  Timeline  = Under Goryeo period = The Jurchens in the Yalu River region were tributaries of Goryeo since the reign of Wang Geon, who called upon them during the wars of the Later Three Kingdoms period, but the Jurchens switched allegiance between Liao and Goryeo multiple times, taking advantage of the tension between the two nations; posing a potential threat to Goryeo's border security, the Jurchens offered tribute to the Goryeo court, expecting lavish gifts in return.Breuker 2010, pp. 220-221. \\"The Jurchen settlements in the Amnok River region had been tributaries of Koryŏ since the establishment of the dynasty, when T'aejo Wang Kŏn heavily relied on a large segment of Jurchen cavalry to defeat the armies of Later Paekche. The position and status of these Jurchen is hard to determine using the framework of the Koryŏ and Liao states as reference, since the Jurchen leaders generally took care to steer a middle course between Koryŏ and Liao, changing sides or absconding whenever that was deemed the best course. As mentioned above, Koryŏ and Liao competed quite fiercely to obtain the allegiance of the Jurchen settlers who in the absence of large armies effectively controlled much of the frontier area outside the Koryŏ and Liao fortifications. These Jurchen communities were expert in handling the tension between Liao and Koryŏ, playing out divide-and-rule policies backed up by threats of border violence. It seems that the relationship between the semi- nomadic Jurchen and their peninsular neighbours bore much resemblance to the relationship between Chinese states and their nomad neighbours, as described by Thomas Barfield.\\" Under Wanyan Wuyashu's order, Shi Shihuan (石適歡) led Jurchen army under the invitation of anti-Goryeo Jurchens in Helandian(present-day southeastern Hamgyong) to defeat pro-Goryeo Jurchens in the area. After subdueing Jurchens in Helandian, the Jurchen army advanced southward to chase about 1,800 remnants who defected to Goryeo. Goryeo did not hand them over but sent Im Gan (林幹) to intercept the Wanyan army. However, Shi Shihuan defeated Im Gan north of the Chŏngp'yŏng wall and invaded northeastern frontier of Goryeo. Goryeo dispatched Yoon Gwan (尹瓘) but lost a battle again. As a result, Wuyashu subjugated the Jurchen in Helandian. In 1107 Goryeo dispatched five large armies led by Yoon Gwan to Helandian. They destroyed a hundred Jurchen villages and built nine fortresses there. After a one-year battle, the Wanyan army won two fortresses but they suffered heavy losses and seven other fortresses were still held by the Goryeo forces. Jurchens offered a truce to Goryeo and Goryeo and the Jurchen achieved a settlement. As a result, Jurchens swore not to invade Goryeo and Goryeo withdrew from the nine fortresses. = Under Joseon period = There were two kinds of Jurchens: the Enemy/Treacherous Jurchens 적호(賊胡) and the defensive/boundary Jurchens 번호(藩胡) considered as Jianzhou Jurchens living in Korean borders. After the collapse of Yuan dynasty, Goryeo and then Joseon made the Jurchens in the area around Hamhung on the northeastern Korean peninsula submit as vassals. The Joseon Koreans tried to deal with the military threat posed by the Jurchens by using both forceful means and incentives and by launching military attacks, while at the same time they tried to appease them with titles and degrees, traded with them and sought to acculturate them by having Korean women marry Jurchens and integrating them into Korean culture. Despite these measures, fighting continued between the Jurchen and the Koreans.Seth 2006, p. 138.Seth 2010, p. 144. The Ming Yongle Emperor was determined to wrest the Jurchens out of Korean influence and have China dominate them instead.Zhang 2008, p. 29. Korea tried to persuade Jurchen leader Mentemu (Möngke Temür) to reject the Ming overtures, but were unsuccessful since Möngke Temür folded and submitted to the Ming.Goodrich 1976, p. 1066.Peterson 2002, p. 13.Twitchett 1998, pp. 286-287.Zhang 2008, p. 30. Joseon under Sejong the Great engaged in military campaigns against the Jurchen and after defeating the Odoli, Maolian and Udige clans, Joseon managed to take control of Hamgyong. This shaped the modern borders of Korea around 1450 when several border forts were established in the region.

It was a court of first instance in England and Wales that dealt with family matters. Cases were either heard in front of a bench of lay magistrates or a district judge (magistrates' courts). From 22 April 2014 the family proceedings court has ceased to exist and its functions were absorbed into the new single Family Court following the enactment of the Crime and Courts Act 2013. Magistrates continue to sit in family proceedings in the way described but within a different court arrangement.  Jurisdiction  The family proceedings court's jurisdiction was derived from the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. The Children Act 1989 provided the basis for most applications dealing with children. Beyond the 1989 Act, magistrates continue to have quite separate powers to make maintenance orders between spouses to protect them from one another, to protect ‘associated persons’ and to regulate occupation of the family home. The main provisions that affected law and procedure in the family proceedings court were: a. Domestic Proceedings and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1978 b. Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980 c. Adoption and Children Act 2002 d. Child Support Act 1991 e. Children Act 1989 f. Family Law Act 1996. =Public law and private law cases= The family proceedings court played a key role in what are called: a. Public law cases (e.g. applications for care or supervision orders in respect of children who are at risk, usually brought by local authorities) b. Private law cases (e.g., disputes between parents concerning the upbringing of children) =Other work= a. Applications by spouses for financial provision for themselves, i.e., provision for parties who remain married--maintenance arrangements for children are for the most part dealt with by the Child Support Agency (CSA) b. Non-molestation orders to prevent domestic violence and involving, where appropriate, the use of powers to arrest c. Occupation orders to keep a spouse out of the family home and also involving, where appropriate, the use of powers to arrest d. Declaration of parentage e. Adoption, i.e., orders giving parental rights and duties in respect of a child to adoptive parents f. Enforcement concerning, for example: i. 1989 Act cases ii. Orders for financial provision for spouses, including enforcement of assessments by the CSA and of maintenance orders from abroad, and vice versa (known as ‘reciprocal enforcement’) g. Variation and enforcement of ‘old’ maintenance cases.  Rules of court  The rules of the family proceedings court were in The Family Procedure Rules 2010. Where those rules are silent on a matter then the Magistrates' Courts Rules 1981 (as amended) applied.  Constitution  Family proceedings courts must be made up of three magistrates from the family panel and include a man and a woman, unless this is impracticable, when a minimum of two is allowed. A family proceedings court may comprise a district judge as chairman and one or two lay justices who are members of the family panel. If this is not practicable the district judge may sit alone.  Family panel  Family panels are made up of magistrates elected by their local colleagues for this work on the basis of their aptitude and personal suitability (except in London where different arrangements exist). In addition to their special duties in the family proceedings court, members of the panel continue to serve in the ordinary magistrates’ court. Different arrangements for the selection of magistrates to sit in the family proceedings court are likely to be in place in 2006 after the Courts Act 2003 is fully implemented. =Chairmen and deputy chairmen= The panel appoints its own chairman. It also elects enough deputy court chairmen to ensure that family proceedings are always chaired by someone trained for this role. Different provision for chairmen will also be in place from 2006.  Appeal from magistrates' court in family matters  Provisions contained within the Access to Justice Act 1999 (Destination of Appeals) (Family Proceedings) Order 2009 s.4 insert s.111A into the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980. This section dictates that: \\"(1) This section applies in relation to family proceedings in a magistrates' court.\\" \\"(2) Any person who was a party to any proceeding before the court, or is aggrieved by the order, determination or other proceeding of the court, may question the proceeding on the ground that it is wrong in law or is in excess of jurisdiction by appealing to a county court.” Subsequently, all appeals from the Magistrates’ Court will now be dealt with by the County Court and will have 21 days in which to file the appeal.

It was discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel on November 3, 1787. John L. E. Dreyer described it as, \\"a planetary nebula, bright, small, round, pretty gradually a very little brighter middle\\". This nebula is the result of an aging star casting off its outer atmosphere. Overall the nebula is elliptical in form, with a complex interior structure having inner and outer shells, several bright equatorial knots, and two jet-like features near the nebula poles. The rim of the inner shell is ellipsoidal with an aspect ratio of 1.6 and a major axis spanning . The outer shell is more circular, and is approximately in diameter. The faint outer shell is expanding with a higher velocity than the inner shell, and the knots are moving at the same velocity as the outer shell. The outer shell has an estimated age of 2,500 years, while the inner shell is 1,600 years old. The morphological features of the nebula may be explained by an interacting binary star system with one of the pair passing through the asymptotic giant branch phase. The jets may be generated by an accretion disk surrounding the resulting white dwarf star.

Conceived and produced by Madhouse founders Masao Maruyama and Rintaro, it adapts short stories by Taku Mayumura featured in the 1986 collection of the same Japanese titlehttps://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4041357470 and is executive produced by publisher Haruki Kadokawa. The 50 minute-long film has three segments, each under a different screenwriter and film director: Rintaro's \\"Labyrinth Labyrinthos,\\" an exploration into the maze of a little girl's mind, Yoshiaki Kawajiri's \\"Running Man,\\" focusing on a deadly auto race, and Katsuhiro Ōtomo's \\"Construction Cancellation Order,\\" a cautionary tale about man's dependency on technology. In addition to original music by Godiego's Mickie Yoshino, two prominently feature famous pieces of Western classical music: the first of Erik Satie's Gymnopédies and the \\"Toreador Song\\" of Georges Bizet's Carmen in \\"Labyrinth\\" and \\"Morning Mood\\" from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt score, in an ironic manner, in \\"The Order.\\" The film premiered on September 25, 1987, at that year's Tōkyō International Fantastic Film Festival. Other than festival screenings, distributor the Tōhō Company originally relegated the film direct-to-video, releasing a VHS on October 10, 1987, but did eventually give it a general cinema release in Japan, on April 15, 1989. In English, the film was licensed, dubbed and released theatrically (as a double feature with the first Silent Möbius film) and to VHS in North America by Streamline Pictures, the license later being taken up by the now also out of business ADV Films.  Plot  = Labyrinth Labyrinthos = The short follows Sachi (Hideko Yoshida/Cheryl Chase), a girl locked in a game of hide-and-seek with her cat Cicerone. Her search leads her to an old longcase clock which doubles as a doorway to a labyrinth world. The world is filled with supernatural oddities and characters, such as cardboard working class citizens, an invisible dog, a skeleton-led train and a weird circus. Eventually, Sachi and Cicerone arrive at a circus tent where a viewing screen is displayed, leading to the following segments. = Running Man = Zack Hugh (Banjō Ginga) is the titular \\"Running Man,\\" the undefeated champion of the \\"Death Circus\\" racing circuit and has raced for 10 years. Competitors race in high-speed Formula One-like craft, and spectators bet on the lives of these people for huge winnings. A Marlowe-esque reporter (Masane Tsukayama/Michael McConnohie) is sent to interview the mysterious Zack outside of the track and watches one of his races. He soon discovers Hugh has telekinetic abilities which he uses to destroy the other racers, after quietly observing him in the dark, chronically over-using a training interface inside his penthouse. As the race ends in his favor, the monitors in the pit display \\"LIFE FUNCTIONS TERMINATED.\\" Mysteriously, though seemingly dead, Hugh continues around the track and is overtaken by a spectral racer. He attempts to employ the same strategy, straining to destroy the opponent, but in truth it is against his own mind. The force of the telekinesis is directed inward which rapidly tears both Hugh and his car apart. The Death Circus is permanently shut down afterwards; the reporter believing the event's true draw was the spectators' need to see how long Hugh could beat death. = Construction Cancellation Order = A revolution in the fictional South American country of the Aloana Republic has resulted in a new government being installed; this new government refuses to accept a contract detailing the construction of Facility 444. The company responsible for the construction has begun to lose millions, so salaryman Tsutomu Sugioka (Yū Mizushima/Robert Axelrod) is sent to stop production. The work is completely automated, carried out by robots programmed to finish the job no matter the consequences and led by a robot identified as 444-1 (Hiroshi Ōtake/Jeff Winkless). Witnessing the destruction of several robots and Robot 444-1's refusal to cease operations, Tsutomu begins to lose his patience and is nearly killed by 444-1 who was programmed to eliminate anything that poses a threat to the project. He retaliates by destroying 444-1 and follows its powercord that leads to the energy source of the robots in an attempt to finally end the production. Unknown to Tsutomu, the old government has been restored and they have agreed to honor the contract once more.  Production  = Labyrinth Labyrinthos = is written for the screen and directed by Rintaro, with character design and animation direction by Atsuko Fukushima, key animation by Manabu Ōhashi, Reiko Kurihara and Fukushima and art direction by Yamako Ishikawa. It serves as the anthology's \\"top-level\\" story, a framing device that leads into the other two works. = Running Man = is written for the screen and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, with character design and animation direction by Kawajiri, mechanical design by Takashi Watabe and Satoshi Kumagai, key animation by Shinji Otsuka, Nobumasa Shinkawa, Toshio Kawaguchi and Kengo Inagaki and art direction by Katsushi Aoki. The segment also appeared on Episode 205 of Liquid Television with a different voice actor, Rafael Ferrer, than Michael McConnohie's Streamline dub. = Construction Cancellation Order = is written for the screen and directed by Katsuhiro Ōtomo, with character design by Ōtomo, animation direction by Takashi Nakamura, key animation by Kōji Morimoto, Nakamura, Ōtomo and Kunihiko Sakurai and art direction by Takamura Mukuo. This segment's depiction of South America as a dangerous, unstable place is comparable to other depictions in the Japanese media during the 1980s such as Osamu Tezuka's 1987 comic Gringo.

S. Eliot's 1939 poetry book Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. He also appears in the Andrew Lloyd Webber 1981 musical Cats, which is based on Eliot's book. Macavity is a master criminal and con artist; he possesses mystical powers and is the antagonist of the musical.  Origins and etymology  T. S. Eliot was a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle and the character of Macavity is a literary allusion to Professor Moriarty, the criminal mastermind in the Sherlock series. Evidence that Macavity was based on Moriarty was first presented by H.T. Webster and H.W. Starr in 1954, and later rediscovered by Katharine Loesch. In a letter to Frank Morley, Eliot wrote, \\"I have done a new cat modeled on the late Professor Moriarty, but he doesn't seem very popular; too sophisticated perhaps.\\"David E. Chinitz, A Companion to T. S. Eliot, page 231, John Wiley and Sons, 2009, The name \\"Macavity\\" is thus a pun on \\"Moriarty\\". The word 'cavity' also implies a hole or void or absence of something, and Macavity is described in the poem as being \\"not there\\" at the time or location of any crime.  Poem  The poem \\"Macavity the Mystery Cat\\" is the best known of Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats, the only book Eliot wrote for a younger audience.Morag Styles, From the garden to the street: an introduction to 300 years of poetry for children (Volume 1997), page 217, Surendra Kumar 1998, The poem is considered particularly suitable reading for 11- and 12-year-olds.Stephen Tunnicliffe, Poetry experience: teaching and writing poetry in secondary schools, page 38, Taylor & Francis, 1984, Although originally published as part of a collection of poems, \\"Macavity the Mystery Cat\\" was published as a standalone book by Faber and Faber in 2015. In the poem, Macavity is a master criminal who is too clever to leave any evidence of his guilt. His nicknames include: the Mystery Cat, the Hidden Paw, and the Napoleon of Crime. Similarly, Sherlock Holmes describes Moriarty as \\"the Napoleon of Crime\\" in The Adventure of the Final Problem and a \\"Napoleon gone wrong\\" in The Valley of Fear. According to the poem, even when the Secret Service decides that Macavity was behind a loss, they can't catch him, as \\"he's a mile away\\", \\"...[or] engaged in doing complicated long division sums\\". Doyle wrote that Moriarty \\"is never caught\\" as at the moment of the crime he is probably \\"working out problems on a blackboard ten miles away\\" (The Adventure of the Final Problem). Macavity is described as being a ginger cat who is very tall and thin with sunken eyes, and \\"sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake\\". The poem also says: \\"His brow is deeply lined in thought, his head is highly domed; His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.\\" Once again, this description is a close parallel to that of Professor Moriarty: The poem accuses Macavity of misbehaviour that would be within the capabilities of an ordinary cat, such as stealing milk, but also holds him responsible for major crimes. He is referred to as a \\"fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity\\" and has been suspected of stifling Pekes, vandalism, theft, cheating at cards, espionage and controlling an organised crime ring with Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer and Griddlebone among the members. Holmes in Doyle's narrative describes Moriarty as \\"the organizer of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city.\\" Webster and Starr assumed that Eliot referred to the cases of Mr. Joseph Harrison (The Adventure of the Naval Treaty) and Herr Hugo Oberstein (The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans) when he wrote in the poem – \\"And when the Foreign Office finds a Treaty's gone astray,/ And the admirality loses some plans and drawings by the way\\".Philip A. Shreffler, Sherlock Holmes by gas-lamp, page 272, Fordham University Press, 1989, Macavity apparently possesses the mystical power of levitation, as he \\"breaks the law of gravity\\".  Musical  Grzegorz Suski as Macavity in the non-replica production of Cats in Roma Musical Theatre in Warsaw, 9 November 2007. Macavity is the only real villain in the musical Cats by Andrew Lloyd Webber.Sandra Choron, Harry Choron and Arden Moore, Planet Cat: A CAT-alog, page 107, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, He kidnaps Old Deuteronomy, the Jellicle leader, and attempts to abduct Demeter, one of two cats who sing about him.Sandra Choron, Harry Choron and Arden Moore, Planet Cat: A CAT-alog, page 106, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, Lloyd Webber noted that \\"Macavity... is obviously a take-off on Moriarty.\\"Rhoda Koenig, \\"On the heels of Evita, the poetic Cats leaps\\", New York Magazine, page 38, 20 September 1982 The character was originally played by Richard Pettyfer in the original West End production,Kurt Gänzl, The encyclopaedia of the musical theatre (Volume 1), page 241, Schirmer Books, 1994, Kenneth Ard in the Broadway production,Kurt Gänzl, British musical theatre (Volume 2), page Page 1083, Oxford University Press, 1986, Bryn Walters in the Cats 1998 film adaptation, and Idris Elba in the 2019 film adaptation of the musical. Within the storyline of the musical, Macavity makes several attempts to scare the tribe. This culminates in his abduction of Old Deuteronomy, after which two queen cats, Bombalurina and Demeter, sing about him. He then returns disguised as Old Deuteronomy, but is unmasked by Demeter. Munkustrap and Alonzo come to her defense and, in a dramatic cat fight, battle him. Confronted and surrounded by other tribe members, he manages to escape. As seen in the film production and most stage performances, he appears to be capable of performing some form of hypnosis. When Demeter and Bombalurina (a flirty queen cat who is close friends with Demeter) sing about him, they do so in a sensuous manner, suggesting he is more familiar to them. The Macavity number develops from a bluesy duet into a big female ensemble routine.Michael Billington, One night stands: a critic's view of modern British theatre, page 165, Nick Hern Books, 2002, Macavity is typically depicted as a cat with a chaotic array of red, orange, white, and sharp black stripes. He is often portrayed with very long claws and wild dark hair. The role of Macavity is usually played by the same actor as Plato (a chorus cat who notably does a pas de deux with Victoria during the Jellicle Ball). His costume is ginger and white, and specifically includes a simple make-up design that the actor transforms into the elaborate Macavity make-up, and then re-applies after the featured scene. Admetus/Plato is also often recognisable as one of the tallest cast members, as the fight scene between Macavity and Munkustrap requires him to be able to lift other male dancers.  Film  In the film Cats (2019 film) Macavity is played by Idris Elba.

It was found in June 2003 in Ilam parish, Staffordshire, by metal-detectorists, and, in 2005, was bought jointly by the Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, the Potteries Museum in Stoke-on-Trent and London's British Museum, with the help of a grant of £112,200 from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is a find of great national and international significance. The pan rotates between a number of locations, including the joint owning museums and another museum on Hadrian's Wall. Description The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, although lacking its handle and base, is an extremely well preserved enamelled and inscribed bronze (strictly speaking, \\"copper alloy\\") vessel for cooking and serving food, decorated in a Celtic style. (The Celtic peoples of the Roman period made more use of enamel on metal than other parts of the Empire.) It weighs 132.5 g, and is 47 mm high with a maximum diameter of 94 mm, and is 54 mm around the outside of the base.BM collection database A complete trulla in silver The decoration consists of \\"eight roundels, with eight pairs of intervening hollow-sided triangles. Each roundel encloses a swirling six-armed whirligig centred on a three-petalled device inlaid with red, blue, turquoise and yellow-coloured enamel.\\" It has been suggested that in addition to its functional role it may have been a 'souvenir' of Hadrian's Wall, made for a soldier who had served there. It may have been made as a decorative pan and was then customised by having an inscription added later (using an engraved, rather than relief-cast, inscription as in other enamelled objects of this type).Jackson, 2012, p.58 The inscription round the rim is engraved and then filled with enamel. It names forts on the wall: MAIS (Bowness-on-Solway), COGGABATA (Drumburgh), VXELODVNVM (Stanwix), CAMMOGLANNA (Castlesteads). The final part: RIGORE VALI AELI DRACONIS, is more elusive in meaning, but refers to the wall VALI, and probably a soldier DRACO. AELI may be part of his name, but was also Hadrian's family name, so may go with VALI, indicating that the Romans called the wall the \\"Aelian Wall\\". There are other comparable trullae, and two with inscriptions relating to the wall; the inscription means this piece was almost certainly manufactured locally. Judging by these other finds, the handle would have been flat, with enamel decoration on the upper surface. The Rudge Cup has a different shape, but also names forts on the wall (see that article for the \\"Amiens Skillet\\", another vessel with inscribed fort names).

David Snowdon, the founding Nun Study investigator, began the research at the University of Minnesota, but moved it to the University of Kentucky in 1986. In 2008, with Snowdon's retirement, the study returned to the University of Minnesota. Similar environmental influences and general lifestyles among the participants make the nuns an ideal population to study, and although it is ongoing it has yielded several findings. At the University of Minnesota, Kelvin Lim and Laura Hemmy are developing a new Alzheimer's Disease study working with the School Sisters of Notre Dame.Trust & Dare, newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014. In 1992, researchers at Rush University Medical Center Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center (RADC), building on the success of the Nun Study, proposed the Rush Religious Orders Study. The Religious Orders Study was funded by the National Institute on Aging in 1993, and is ongoing.Overview and Findings from the Religious Orders Study, Curr Alzheimer Res. 2012 July 1:9(6): 628-645. Researchers at the University of Minnesota are collaborating with the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center on the Religious Orders Study, as well as several other ongoing studies.Trust & Dare, newsletter of the School Sisters of Notre Dame, 2014. Origin The Nun Study, begun in 1986 with funding by the National Institute on Aging, focuses on a group of 678 American Roman Catholic sisters who are members of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. Studying a relatively homogeneous group (no drug use, little or no alcohol, similar housing and reproductive histories, etc.) minimizes the extraneous variables that may confound other similar research. Current findings Researchers have also accessed the convent archive to review documents amassed throughout the lives of the nuns in the study. Among the documents reviewed were autobiographical essays that have been written by the nuns upon joining the sisterhood; upon review, it was found that an essay's lack of linguistic density (e.g., complexity, vivacity, fluency) functioned as a significant predictor of its author's risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in old age. The approximate mean age of the nuns at the time of writing was merely 22 years. Roughly 80% of nuns whose writing was measured as lacking in linguistic density went on to develop Alzheimer's disease in old age; meanwhile, of those whose writing was not lacking, only 10% later developed the disease.Riley KP, Snowdon DA, Desrosiers MF, Markesbery WR: Early life linguistic ability, late life cognitive function, and neuropathology: Findings from the Nun Study Neurobiology of Aging 26(3):341347, 2005. Overall, findings of the Nun Study suggest \\"that traits in early, mid, and late life have strong relationships with the risk of Alzheimer's disease, as well as the mental and cognitive disabilities of old age.\\"The University of Minnesota's Nun Study FAQ page , December 18, 2009.

The characters are composed of two pigs, one white and one black, with square-shaped bodies, dots for eyes, a snout and a curly tail at the back. They are also occasionally seen with a bee flying around them. Their earliest appearances date back to various licensing and gift shows in Japan in 2005. Monokuro Boo's tagline is \\"Simple is Best\\", and one or both of the pigs can also be seen with speech bubbles that say, \\"Boo\\", \\"Love?\\", \\"Enjoy?\\", or \\"Happy\\". The character is licensed under RM Enterprises (BVI) Ltd., who takes care of the development and promotion of the character in Asia, as well as other international territories.  Character Concept and Name  When these characters were first created, the name was not \\"Monokuro Boo\\", it was \\"Monotone,\\" with \\"mono\\" coming from \\"monochrome\\" and \\"ton,\\" a word for pig. This pun is what originally inspired the designer to create black and white pig characters. The designer deliberately bucked the then-current trend for colorful goods for a monotone palette, hoping to create a fun and unique style. By introducing a line of merchandise that exclusively featured black, white and gray, the designer hoped to prove that it is possible for such a concept to be accepted and entertained by the general public, consumers and fans of kawaii merchandise in general. In line with the character's concept, the name \\"Monokuro Boo\\" is also a derivation of the words \\"Monokuro\\" (\\"Monochrome\\") and \\"Boo\\" (the Japanese onomatopoeic equivalent for \\"oink\\").  Baby Boo  Despite Monokuro Boo's statement that kawaii does not always have to be colorful, San-X has also created a spin-off line of products which features smaller, pastel or candy-colored pigs known as Baby Boo. Baby Boo consists of seven pigs who are named and colored as follows: *Berry – pastel red *Peach – pastel pink *Orange – pastel orange *Lemon – pastel yellow *Mint – pastel green *Soda – pastel blue *Grape – pastel purple/lavender Baby Boo's tagline is \\"Are you happy?\\" (\\"anata wa shiawase?\\") and \\"So Happy With You*\\" (\\"anata to iru to tottemo tanoshī*\\"). As with Monokuro Boo, a bee-like insect is also seen hovering near the Baby Boo, except the bee is made to look like a strawberry (or ladybug). Some of the Baby Boos also say, \\"Poo\\".

It pitted the #4 Orlando Predators (9-5) of the National Conference against the #1 Tampa Bay Storm (12-2), also of the National Conference. This was the second and final ArenaBowl to have the \\"War on I-4\\" rivalry on the big stage. For the Predators, it was their fourth ArenaBowl appearance in their eight years of existence (having lost ArenaBowls VI, VIII and IX). This year, they were under the command of first-year head coach (and former Tampa Bay Storm QB) Jay Gruden. For the Storm, this was their eighth overall appearance as they were going for their fifth ArenaBowl title in eight seasons. Not only did they face their arch-rivals from Orlando, but they also had face their former star player in Jay Gruden.  Game summary  In the first quarter, the Predators drew first blood with kicker David Cool getting a 23-yard field goal, yet the Storm took the lead with QB Peter Tom Willis completing a 12-yard TD pass to OS George LaFrance. Orlando would respond with QB Pat O'Hara completing a 23-yard TD pass to OS Robert Gordon, yet Tampa Bay answered with Willis and LaFrance hooking up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, the Predators drew closer with back-up QB Connell Maynor getting a 3-yard TD run, while the Storm had kicker Björn Nittmo get a 44-yard field goal. Afterwards, Orlando took the lead prior to halftime with FB/LB Rick Hamilton getting a 36-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Predators took control with Hamilton getting a 5-yard TD run, a safety with OL/DL Webbie Burnett tackling George LaFrance in the end zone after LaFrance recovered his own fumble in the end zone after being hit on the one yard line. Barry Wagner set up Hamilton 's 10-yard run by intercepting WR/DB Barry Wagner returning a missed field goal 48 yards for a touchdown. The only response that Tampa Bay could show was Willis and LaFrance hooking up with each other yet again on a 7-yard TD pass. Afterwards, Orlando wrapped up the period with Cool kicking a 20-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Predators continued its beatdown with DS Damon Mason returning an interception 22 yards for a touchdown (with a failed PAT). All that was left of the Storm's firepower was Willis' 8-yard TD pass to WR/LB Stevie Thomas (with a failed PAT). Immediately afterwards, Orlando wrapped up its very first Arena Bowl title with Gordon returning a kickoff 8 yards for a touchdown.

Similarly after in hale (whole), hame (home) and hairse (hoarse) often written hyil, hyim and hyirs(c)h) in dialect writing. The realisation may also occur for final ae in for example spae (foretell). * In some varieties e (vowel 16) may be realised rather than , for example bed, het (heated), yett (gate), etc. * Final ee (vowel 11) is usually realised , for example dree (endure), flee (fly), lee (lie, fib), see, thee (thigh) and tree, often written drei or drey, flei or fley, lei or ley, sei, sey, thei or theye and trei or trey in dialect writing. * eu (vowel 7 before and see ui) is often realised , for example beuk (book), eneuch (enough), ceuk (cook), leuk (look) and teuk (took). * ou, also oo (vowel 6) when final is realised , for example brou (brow), cou (cow), dou (dove), hou (how), nou (now), fou (full), pou (pull), sou (sow), allou (allow), throu (through) and you often represented by ow(e) in dialect writing. *ow, owe (root final) (vowel 13) may be rather than in bowe (bow), howe (hollow), knowe (knoll), cowp (overturn), yowe (ewe), etc. * ui (vowel 7) is often realised or , however an unrounded realisation as in Central Scots is now widespread, for example, abuin (above), cuit (ankle) and guid (good). Unrounding to is now common in adae (ado), buird (board), dae (do), fluir (floor), fuird (ford), shae (shoe) and tae (to~too).

History Although Huguenot settlers came to New France at an early date, the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 outlawed Protestantism in France and its colonies. The British Conquest of 1760 allowed Protestant churches to form in Canada. A French-language Protestant movement began in 1841 and eventually 25 congregations and schools were formed within the Presbyterian Church in Canada. Mission interest then turned west and as a result the congregations declined in Québec, reaching a low point of three congregations in 1975.http://www.reformiert- online.net/adressen/detail.php?id=112117≶=eng Starting in 1978, mission efforts by the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the Presbyterian Church in America, and the Christian Reformed Church led to the creation of new French- speaking reformed congregations in Québec.http://www.erq.qc.ca/francais/notrehistoire.html Nine of these congregations, scattered in different regions of the province, broke ties with the Presbyterian Church in Canada and formed the Église réformée du Québec under the leadership of David Craig.http://shpfq1.org/wp- content/uploads/2015/11/SHPFQ_BULLETIN24_0609.pdf The denomination came into existence officially on 6 November 1988.http://erq.qc.ca/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/ERQ-Introduction.pdf Although officially independent from this denomination, Farel Reformed Theological Seminary has strong personal ties to the Reformed Church of Quebec through its founder David Craig.

His problems with alcohol, idiosyncratic delivery and strong Liverpudlian accent were factors in his missing out on national success, but his slick anti-climactic style of observational comedy was well regarded in his home town of Liverpool, and he gave a graphic commentary on the social history of Merseyside. Biography  Hamilton was born off Scotland Road, a dockland area in north Liverpool, where he lived with two sisters, Margaret and Susie and a Brother Joey. He married Teresa, and they had four sons and a daughter. He worked casually as a docker and on building sites before becoming an \\"ale-house comic\\" who landlords paid in drinks in exchange for a short comedy set. He appeared on the ITV TV show The Comedians in the 1970s and appeared live on both the BBC and ITV. His unreliability lead to London booking agents avoiding him. Right up until a month before he died after a stroke in 2003, Hamilton was performing on the Merseyside club circuit, headlining the Radio Merseyside Summer Friday in front of more than 900 people.  Tributes  A plaque to Hamilton was unveiled at Eldonian Village Hall in 2004. On 10 April 2007 a profile of Jackie Hamilton entitled Standing up for Liverpool was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. Presented by Les Dennis and produced by Tony Staveacre, it explored the life and career of the much-loved joker, using rare tapes of the man himself in interview and performance and the reminiscences of Ricky Tomlinson, Lennie Chesworth and Mickey Finn.

The film exemplified the growing trend of Chinese films by the mid-1930s of incorporating references (both veiled and explicit) to the war with Japan. In this way, Crossroads joins films like Blood on Wolf Mountain by Fei Mu and The Big Road by Sun Yu. Crossroads has its background in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Produced by Mingxing Film Company, the film also represented an expansion by Mingxing into the leftist film market that had been dominated by its rival Lianhua Film Company, due to a flagging financial situation. In 2001, a sequel was made, despite the half- century gap, entitled New Crossroads. Plot The film begins at a dock at Shanghai, where college graduate Xu is contemplating suicide because he cannot find a job. His friend Zhao (Zhao Dan) stops him, and leads him back to their rented apartment. We learn that the four graduate friends are all jobless. Zhao serenades to Xu and dissuades him from thoughts of suicide, asking him to concentrate on his freelance translation job instead. Xu tells Zhao he has decided to sell his degree in order to raise funds to see his mother in the countryside. His other friend Tang comes to celebrate his own birthday with a fourth friend, Liu. A female college graduate Yang (Bai Yang) comes to Shanghai to look for a job, and rents the room beside Zhao's. Meanwhile, Zhao finds a job at the press. Jubilant, he washes his laundry and hangs them up on a pole that extends into his neighbour's room. Yang is napping, and the wet laundry drips her pillow damp. Yang's friend comes in and bangs a few nails for her to hang her clothes, and Zhao's framed photos fall off at the opposite side of the wall. Zhao comes home from work in the morning, while Yang goes to work as a trainer at a textile factory. Zhao leaves a bag in the tram he is alighting, but fortunately Yang helps retrieve it for him through the window. When Zhao gets home, he sees his scattered photos on the floor back in his apartment, and retaliates by hitting the nails through to the other side and flinging rubbish to the other room. The girls hit back in the night, when he is not around, and write him a note of warning. Hence begins a lighthearted feud that swings to and fro between the two parties. Zhao meets Yang again in the tram and helps her retrieve something she dropped outside the window. He goes to her textile company to find materials to write his journalistic report, and helps fight a hooligan who is harassing Yang. The two arrange to meet at a park nearby a couple of days later for his interview. By then, Yang has already realized he is the tenant next door. After the interview, Zhao does a series of write-ups entitled \\"the sad life-story of a female worker\\". One day, Yang finally knocks on Zhao's door and reveals to him who she really is. She tells him she is only disclosing this secret because she is leaving Shanghai – the factory she works in has recently closed down. Zhao stops her and tells her that he will support her in Shanghai. However, after he goes to work, Yang goes through a dilemma, and finally decides to leave so as not to be a financial burden on him. When Yang's friend realize they are pining for each other, she decide to bring the couple together again. By then, Zhao has received news that he, too, has been dismissed from his job. He and Tang walk towards the pier, where they meet Yang and her friend, who are also out of work. They read from the newspaper that their friend Xu has committed suicide because he is unemployed. Zhao and Tang conclude that Xu is too weak, and that they must be optimistic like their other friend Liu, in facing their paths in life. The four friends then walk forward side by side with their arms entwined. DVD release Crossroads was released on Region 0 DVD in the United States on May 8, 2007 by Cinema Epoch.

Although the model differs in its meaning and implications for each field, the general idea is that there are expectations as well as values or beliefs that affect subsequent behavior. Education model =History and model overview= John William Atkinson developed the expectancy–value theory in the 1950s and 1960s in an effort to understand the achievement motivation of individuals.Eccles, J. (1983). Expectancies, values, and academic behaviors. In J. T. Spence (Ed.), Achievement and achievement motives: Psychological and sociological approaches (pp. 75-146). San Francisco, CA: W. H. Freeman. In the 1980s, Jacquelynne Eccles expanded this research into the field of education. According to expectancy–value theory, students' achievement and achievement related choices are most proximally determined by two factors: expectancies for success, and subjective task values. Expectancies refer to how confident an individual is in his or her ability to succeed in a task whereas task values refer to how important, useful, or enjoyable the individual perceives the task. Theoretical and empiricalNagengast, B., Marsh, H. W., Scalas, L. F., Xu, M. K., Hau, K. T., & Trautwein, U. (2011). Who took the \\"×\\" out of expectancy–value theory?

W., Nagengast, B., Lüdtke, O., Nagy, G., & Jonkmann, K. (2012). Probing for the multiplicative term in modern expectancy–value theory: A latent interaction modeling study. Journal of educational psychology, 104(3), 763-777. work suggests that expectancies and values interact to predict important outcomes such as engagement, continuing interest, and academic achievement. Other factors, including demographic characteristics, stereotypes, prior experiences, and perceptions of others' beliefs and behaviors affect achievement related outcomes indirectly through these expectancies and values. This model has most widely been applied and used in research in the field of education. =Expectancies= Expectancies are specific beliefs individuals have regarding their success on certain tasks they will carry out in the short-term future or long-term future.Eccles, J. S. & Wigfield, A. (2002). Motivational beliefs, values, and goals. Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 109-132. The expectancies an individual has shape their behaviors as well as the choices they make. For example, a high school student might believe that they really struggle on standardized tests. This leads them to expect that they will perform poorly on the SAT. These beliefs then impact their actual performance on the SAT. These expectancies are tied to concepts such as self-concept and self-efficacy. Self-concept is a broad concept that involves one's beliefs about their own abilities to reach their goals.Bong, M. & Skaalvik, E.M. (2003). Academic self-concept and self-efficacy: How different are they really?. Educational Psychology Review, 15(1), 1-40. Self- efficacy is similar in an academic context, because it involves one's beliefs about their abilities and competence; however, it is specific to certain domains, such as math and history. =Subjective task values= According to Eccles and colleagues subjective task value can be thought of the motivation that allows an individual to answer the question \\"Do I Want to do This Activity and Why?\\"Wigfield. A., Cambria. J., \\"Student's achievement values, goal orientations, and interest: Definitions, development, and relations to achievement outcomes, \\" Developmental Review 30, 2010, 1-35. Subjective task values can be broken into four subcategories: Attainment Value (Importance for identity or self), Intrinsic Value (Enjoyment or Interest), Utility Value (Usefulness or Relevance), and Cost (loss of time, overly-high effort demands, loss of valued alternatives, or negative psychological experiences such as stress). Traditionally, attainment value and intrinsic value are more highly correlated. What's more, these two constructs tend to be related to intrinsic motivation, interest, and task persistence.Hulleman, C. S., Durik, A. M., Schweigert, S. B., & Harackiewicz, J. M. (2008). Task values, achievement goals, and interest: An integrative analysis. Journal of Educational Psychology, 100(2), 398-416 Alternatively, utility value has both intrinsic and extrinsic components.Simons, J., Dewitte, S., & Lens, W. (2004). The role of different types of instrumentality in motivation, study strategies, and performance: know why you learn, so you'll know what you learn! The British journal of educational psychology, 74(Pt 3), 343-60. doi:10.1348/0007099041552314 and has been related to both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes such as course performance and interest.Hulleman, C. S., & Harackiewicz, J. M. (2009). Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes. Science, 326(5958), 1410-1412 Other research shows that utility value has time-dependent characteristics as well.Husman, J., & Lens, W. (1999). The role of the future in student motivation. Educational Psychologist, 34(2), 113-125 Cost has been relatively neglected in the empirical research; however, the construct has received some attention more recently.Luttrell, V. R., Callen, B.

Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing. and suggested that the former are just one type of general human motives that help to direct behavior. =Applications= Developmental trajectories Researchers have found that expectancies and values can be distinguished as separate types of motivation as early as 6 years old.Wigfield, A., & Cambria, J. (2010). Expectancy–value theory: Retrospective and prospective. Advances in motivation and achievement, 16, 35-70 Similarly, types of value (e.g., attainment vs. utility) can be distinguished within an academic domain as early as fifth grade. Generally speaking, Eccles and colleagues implicate a wide array of different factors that determine an individual's expectancies and values, including: * the cultural milieu * socializer's beliefs and behaviors * differential aptitudes of the individual * previous achievement-related experiences * individual perceptions of social beliefs * individual's interpretations of experiences * affective memories * general goals * self- concepts Experts agree that student motivation tends to decline throughout their time in school. Longitudinal research has confirmed this general trend of motivational decline and also demonstrated that motivation is domain specific.Jacobs, J. E., Lanza, S., Osgood, D. W., Eccles, J. S., & Wigfield, A. (2002). Changes in children's self-competence and values: Gender and domain differences across grades one through twelve. Child development, 73(2), 509-527 Researchers have also demonstrated that there are gender differences in motivation. Motivation decline is particularly steep for Math achievement, but less so for reading or sports domains among both boys and girls. Researchers offer two general explanations for these declines in motivation. The first is that students' conceptualizations of different domains become more complex and nuanced—they differentiate between subdomains, which results in an appearance of mean-level decrease. In fact, children as young as 11 years old have demonstrated that they can differentiate between academic domains. The second is that the focus of their environment changes as they age. As students reach higher grades, the focus shifts from learning to achievement. In fact, a large body of research exists showing that shifts from learning to performance as an educational focus can be detrimental to student motivation.Hulleman, C. S., Schrager, S. M., Bodmann, S. M., & Harackiewicz, J. M. (2010). A meta-analytic review of achievement goal measures: Different labels for the same constructs or different constructs with similar labels?. Psychological bulletin, 136(3), 422. Interventions Expectancy–value theory constructs can and have been applied to intervention programs that strive to change motivational beliefs. These interventions are able to increase expectancyBlackwell, L. S., Trzesniewski, K. H., & Dweck, C. S. (2007).

Writing about testing worries boosts exam performance in the classroom. science, 331(6014), 211-213. Such interventions not only target motivation, but also ultimately increase general student achievement and help to close traditionally problematic achievement gaps.Good, C., Aronson, J., & Inzlicht, M. (2003). Improving Adolescents' Standardized Test Performance: An Intervention to Reduce the Effects of Stereotype Threat. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 24, 645-662. For example, value- focused interventions have been developed to help teachers design their curriculum in ways that allow students to see the connections between the material they learn in the classroom and their own lives. Promoting interest and performance in high school science classes. This intervention is able to boost student's performance and interest, particularly for students who have low initial expectancy. According to the expectancy–value theory, this intervention is effective because it increases students interest in the material. Psychology, health, communications, marketing, and economics model Expectancy–value theory was originally created in order to explain and predict individual's attitudes toward objects and actions. Originally the work of psychologist Martin Fishbein, the theory states that attitudes are developed and modified based on assessments about beliefs and values. Primarily, the theory attempts to determine the mental calculations that take place in attitude development. Expectancy–value theory has been used to develop other theories and is still utilized today in numerous fields of study. =History= Dr. Martin Fishbein is credited with developing the expectancy–value theory (EVT) in the early to mid-1970s. It is sometimes referred to as Fishbein's expectancy–value theory or simply expectancy–value model. The primary work typically cited by scholars referring to EVT is Martin Fishbein and Icek Ajzen's 1975 book called Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research. The seed work of EVT can be seen in Fishbein's doctoral dissertation, A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation of the Interrelation between Belief about an Object and the Attitude toward that Object (1961, UCLA) and two subsequent articles in 1962 and 1963 in the journal Human Relations. Fishbein's work drew on the writings of researchers such as Ward Edwards, Milton J. Rosenberg, Edward Tolman, and John B. Watson. =Concepts= EVT has three basic components. First, individuals respond to novel information about an item or action by developing a belief about the item or action. If a belief already exists, it can and most likely will be modified by new information. Second, individuals assign a value to each attribute that a belief is based on. Third, an expectation is created or modified based on the result of a calculation based on beliefs and values. For example, a student finds out that a professor has a reputation for being humorous. The student assigns a positive value to humor in the classroom, so the student has the expectation that their experience with the professor will be positive. When the student attends class and finds the professor humorous, the student calculates that it is a good class. EVT also states that the result of the calculation, often called the \\"attitude\\", stems from complex equations that contain many belief/values pairs. Fishbein and Ajzen (1975) represented the theory with the following equation where attitudes (a) are a factorial function of beliefs (b) and values (v). Theory of reasoned action: Formula In its simplest form, the TRA can be expressed as the following equation: BI (AB)W_1 + (SN)W_2 where: BI = behavioral intention (AB) = one's attitude toward performing the behavior W = empirically derived weights SN = one's subjective norm related to performing the behavior (Source: Hale, 2002) =Current usage= In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Fishbein and Ajzen expanded expectancy–value theory into the theory of reasoned action (TRA). Later Ajzen posited the theory of planned behavior (TPB) in his book Attitudes, Personality, and Behavior (1988). Both TRA and TPB address predictive and explanatory weaknesses with EVT and are still prominent theories in areas such as health communication research, marketing, and economics. Although not used as much since the early 1980s, EVT is still utilized in research within fields as diverse as audience research (Palmgreen & Rayburn, 1985) advertising (Shoham, Rose, & Kahle 1998; Smith & Vogt, 1995), child development (Watkinson, Dwyer, & Nielsen, 2005), education (Eklof, 2006; Ping, McBride, & Breune, 2006), health communication (Purvis Cooper, Burgoon, & Roter, 2001; Ludman & Curry, 1999), and organization communication (Westaby, 2002).

There are several elements to tropical cyclone forecasting: track forecasting, intensity forecasting, rainfall forecasting, storm surge, tornado, and seasonal forecasting. While skill is increasing in regard to track forecasting, intensity forecasting skill remains unchanged over the past several years. Seasonal forecasting began in the 1980s in the Atlantic basin and has spread into other basins in the years since. History =Short term= The methods through which tropical cyclones are forecast have changed with the passage of time. The first known forecasts in the Western Hemisphere were made by Lt. Col. William Reed of the Corps of Royal Engineers at Barbados in 1847. Reed mostly utilized barometric pressure measurements as the basis of his forecasts. Benito Vines introduced a forecast and warning system based on cloud cover changes in Havana during the 1870s. Before the early 1900s, though, most forecasts were done by direct observations at weather stations, which were then relayed to forecast centres via telegraph. It wasn't until the advent of radio in the early twentieth century that observations from ships at sea were available to forecasters. The 1930s saw the usage of radiosondes in tropical cyclone forecasting. The next decade saw the advent of aircraft-based reconnaissance by the military, starting with the first dedicated flight into a hurricane in 1943, and the establishment of the Hurricane Hunters in 1944. In the 1950s, coastal weather radars began to be used in the United States, and research reconnaissance flights by the precursor of the Hurricane Research Division began in 1954. The launch of the first weather satellite, TIROS-I, in 1960, introduced new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present. In the 1970s, buoys were introduced to improve the resolution of surface measurements, which until that point, were not available at all oversea surfaces. =Long term= In the late 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low hurricane activity in the North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel to an increase in major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence. Utilizing his findings, Gray developed an objective, statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity; he predicted only the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes, foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures.http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Includes/Documents/Publications/camargoetal2007.pdf The endeavour proved modestly successful. He subsequently issued forecasts ahead of the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in May and before the peak of the season in August. Students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years, including Christopher Landsea, Paul W. Mielke Jr., and Kenneth J. Berry. Track Track errors for the Atlantic Basin, 1970–2014 The large-scale synoptic flow determines 70 to 90 percent of a tropical cyclone's motion. The deep-layer mean flow is the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of a lower-level wind is a better predictor. Knowledge of the beta effect can be used to steer a tropical cyclone, since it leads to a more northwest heading for tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is also best to smooth out short term wobbles of the storm centre to determine a more accurate trajectory.U. S. Navy. SECTION 1. INFLUENCES ON TROPICAL CYCLONE MOTION. Retrieved on 2007-04-10. Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, and a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.National Hurricane Center (2013-04-03). Annual average model track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1994–2005, for a homogeneous selection of \\"early\\" models. Retrieved on 2006-11-30. An accurate track forecast is important, because if the track forecast is incorrect, forecasts for intensity, rainfall, storm surge, and tornado threat will also be incorrect. =1-2-3 rule= Rita and Philippe shown with 1-2-3 rule predictions. The 1-2-3 rule (mariner's 1-2-3 rule or danger area) is a guideline commonly taught to mariners for severe storm (specifically hurricane and tropical storm) tracking and prediction. It refers to the rounded long-term NHC/TPC forecast errors of 100-200-300 nautical miles at 24-48-72 hours, respectively. These numbers were close to the 10-year average for the 1982–1991-time frame. However, these errors have decreased to near 50-100-150 as NHC forecasters become more accurate. The \\"danger area\\" to be avoided is constructed by expanding the forecast path by a radius equal to the respective hundreds of miles plus the forecast wind radii (size of the storm at those hours).Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Hurricane Awareness Week 2005. Retrieved on 2007-12-24. Intensity Forecasters say they are less skilful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones than cyclone track.National Hurricane Center. Annual average official track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1989–2005, with least-squares trend lines superimposed. Retrieved on 2006-11-30. Available computing power limits forecasters' ability to accurately model a large number of complex factors, such as exact topology and atmospheric conditions, though with increased experience and understanding, even models with the same resolution can be tuned to more accurately reflect real-world behaviour.Why Is It Hard To Predict A Hurricane's Intensity? Another weakness is lack of frequent wind speed measurements in the eye of the storm. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System, launched by NASA in 2016, is expected to provide much more data compared to sporadic measurements by weather buoys and hurricane- penetrating aircraft.Predicting A Hurricane's Intensity May Have Gotten Easier An accurate track forecast is essential to creating accurate intensity forecasts, particularly in an area with large islands such as the western north Pacific and the Caribbean Sea, as proximity to land is an inhibiting factor to developing tropical cyclones. A strong hurricane/typhoon/cyclone can weaken if an outer eye wall forms (typically around 80–160 kilometres (50–100 miles) from the centre of the storm), choking off the convection within the inner eye wall. Such weakening is called an eyewall replacement cycle, and is usually temporary.Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (2006). Frequently Asked Questions: What are \\"concentric eyewall cycles\\" (or \\"eyewall replacement cycles\\") and why do they cause a hurricane's maximum winds to weaken? Hurricane Research Division. Retrieved on 2006-12-14. =Maximum potential intensity= Dr. Kerry Emanuel created a mathematical model around 1988, called the maximum potential intensity or MPI, to compute the upper limit of tropical cyclone intensity based on sea surface temperature and atmospheric profiles from the latest global model runs. Maps created from this equation show values of the maximum achievable intensity due to the thermodynamics of the atmosphere at the time of the last model run (either 0000 or 1200 UTC). However, MPI does not take vertical wind shear into account.Kerry A. Emanuel (1997-08-07). Maximum Intensity Estimation. Retrieved on 2006-10-20. MPI is computed using the following formula: V = A + B \\\\cdot e^{C(T-T_0)} Where V is the maximum potential velocity in meters per second; T is the sea surface temperature underneath the center of the tropical cyclone, T_0 is a reference temperature (30˚C) and A, B and C are curve-fit constants. When A = 28.2, B = 55.8, and C = 0.1813, the graph generated by this function corresponds to the 99th percentile of empirical tropical cyclone intensity data. Rainfall r-CLIPER for Isabel (2003) Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting is important, since between 1970–2004, inland flooding from tropical cyclones caused most of the fatalities from tropical cyclones in the United States.FEMA. Hurricanes. Retrieved on 2013-05-03.Ed Rappaport. Inland Flooding. Retrieved on 2006-06-24. While flooding is common to tropical cyclones near a landmass, there are a few factors which lead to excessive rainfall from tropical cyclones. Slow motion, as was seen during Hurricane Danny and Hurricane Wilma, can lead to high amounts. The presence of topography near the coast, as is the case across much of Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, much of Central America, Madagascar, Réunion, China, and Japan acts to magnify amounts due to upslope flow into the mountains. Strong upper level forcing from a trough moving through the Westerlies, as was the case during Hurricane Floyd, can lead to excessive amounts even from systems moving at an average forward motion. A combination of two of these factors could be especially crippling, as was seen during Hurricane Mitch in Central America. Therefore, an accurate track forecast is essential in order to produce an accurate tropical cyclone rainfall forecast.William M. Frank. Fifth International Workshop On Tropical Cyclones: Topic 2 Tropical Cyclone Landfall Processes. Retrieved on 2007-04-17. However, as a result of global warming, the heat that has built up on the ocean's surface has allowed storms and hurricanes to capture more water vapour and, given the increased temperatures in the atmosphere also, retain the moisture for a longer capacity.Welch, C. (2017). How climate change likely strengthened recent hurricanes. National Geographic [online]. 20 September 2017. Available at: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/08/hurricane-harvey-climate-change- global-warming-weather/ (accessed 9-11-2017). This results in incredible amounts of rainfall upon striking land which can often be the most damaging aspect of a hurricane. Operational methods NHC official forecast for Ernesto (2006) is light blue, while the storm's actual track is the white line over Florida. Historically, tropical cyclone tracking charts were used to include the past track and prepare future forecasts at Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers. The need for a more modernized method for forecasting tropical cyclones had become apparent to operational weather forecasters by the mid-1980s. At that time the United States Department of Defence was using paper maps, acetate, grease pencils, and disparate computer programs to forecast tropical cyclones. The Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System (ATCF) software was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) beginning in 1986, and used since 1988. During 1990 the system was adapted by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for use at the NHC, National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. This provided the NHC with a multitasking software environment which allowed them to improve efficiency and cut the time required to make a forecast by 25% or 1 hour. ATCF was originally developed for use within DOS, before later being adapted to Unix and Linux. Storm surge The main storm surge forecast model in the Atlantic basin is SLOSH, which stands for Sea, Lake, Overland, Surge from Hurricanes. It uses the size of a storm, its intensity, its forward motion, and the topography of the coastal plain to estimate the depth of a storm surge at any individual grid point across the United States. An accurate forecast track is required in order to produce accurate storm surge forecasts. However, if the landfall point is uncertain, a maximum envelope of water (MEOW) map can be generated based on the direction of approach. If the forecast track itself is also uncertain, a maximum of maximums (MoM) map can be generated which will show the worst possible scenario for a hurricane of a specific strength.PC Weather Products. Slosh Data... what is it. Retrieved on 2007-04-15.

Storm Prediction Center Forecast Support For Landfalling Tropical Cyclones. Retrieved on 2013-05-03. Like most of the other forecasts for tropical cyclone effects, an accurate track forecast is required in order to produce an accurate tornado threat forecast. Seasonal forecast By looking at annual variations in various climate parameters, forecasters can make predictions about the overall number and intensity of tropical cyclones that will occur in a given season. For example, when constructing its seasonal outlooks, the Climate Prediction Center in the United States considers the effects of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, 25–40 year tropical cycle, wind shear over the oceans, and ocean surface temperature.Ira Flatow, Science Friday (2009-08-21).

The community was founded by the Ford Motor Company in the early 1900s as a separate company town where Ford had a big plant at the corner of Riverside Drive and Drouillard Road, which at one point employed 14,000 people. The boundaries east to west were Pillette Avenue to Walker Road, and the north and south boundaries were Riverside Drive to Grand Marais Boulevard. Ford City's downtown main street was Drouillard Avenue, named after François Drouillard (an early settler who owned a farm along the general location of the street, which evolved from a private path on his property). The last remaining building of Ford is the engine plant. The town was sparsely-populated and mostly farmland until the Walkerville Wagon Works partnered with Henry Ford (the namesake of the town) to build and import automobiles to Canada at a lower tariff rate by having the Ford Motor Company provide them with the incomplete automobiles and their parts, with Walkerville Wagon Works performing final assembly for domestic (Canadian) purchase. This partnership was Ford Motor Company of Canada, and by 1910, it would move to an even bigger facility in Ford City. By 1913, the community was incorporated as a village with Charles Montreuil as its first mayor, reaching town status just two years later. In 1928, the town legally changed its name to East Windsor and incorporated itself as a city in 1929, though the Great Depression took its toll on the community. With the town facing bankruptcy in 1935, Ford City was merged into the City of Windsor by the provincial government, along with the towns of Sandwich and Walkerville.http://www.walkervilletimes.com/fordcity.htm The community of Ford City first made national headlines on August 22, 1917, when hundreds of French Canadian parishioners mourning the death of their nationalist pastor, Fr. Lucien Alexandre Beaudoin, formed a blockade refusing to admit their newly appointed priest, Fr. François Xavier Laurendeau, on the pretext that they believed he was in favour of the provincial school policy, Regulation XVII, which had severely restricted the use of French in the area\`s bilingual schools. For more than two weeks, the parishioners mounted an around the clock blockade refusing the priest\`s admission to the parish grounds and residence. On September 3, the Catholic Bishop of London, Michael Francis Fallon, sent the parishioners an ultimatum: accept the new priest or face the closure of the church. The warning failed to produce any results. On Saturday, September 8, 1917, Fr. Laurendeau returned to the parish with a police escort of 12 constables. The protesters, who were tipped off by a phone call of their pastor\`s impending return, rang the church bells, and the grounds were soon occupied by more than 3000 parishioners. When Laurendeau and his police escort arrived they faced a sizeable blockade. The police escort pulled out their billy clubs to make their path through the crowd. Amid the pushing, shoving and shouting, someone threw the first blow and a full-scale riot broke out. Through a shower of bricks, rocks, fists, brooms and clubs, the constables managed to reach the church residence. The mayor, Albert Maisonville was forced to read the Riot Act and call upon the military for back up. When the riot finally settled down, nine men had been arrested, and nine people had been seriously injured, including two elderly women who fiercely resisted the policy on the front steps of the church rectory with broomsticks. For more than a year, the parishioners boycotted masses celebrated by Laurendeau and appealed to Pope Benedict XV to replace him. In October 1918, the Vatican ordered the parishioners to accept the new pastor under pain of excommunication, ending the boycott. These events came to represent the culmination of the French-speaking community\`s resistance to Bishop Fallon and his vocal support of the Ontario Government\`s imposition of Regulation 17. The area is also famous for the historic 99-day 1945 Ford Strike during which the workers fought to be unionized, and set up a blockade around the plant. The Rand Formula was created at the end of the strike where workers would have to pay union dues for having a union in their workplaces, which set the standard for all unions in Canada. Ford left Windsor for Oakville in 1953, closing the Riverside Drive plant by 1960 and leaving thousands unemployed as only the casting and engine plants remained.

The nebula is located at a distance of from the Sun. The central star of the nebula is of spectral type WC3 and is in the process of evolving into a white dwarf, having previously shed the atmosphere that created the surrounding nebula.

The star has an estimated temperature of with 5% of the radius of the Sun and is radiating 1,400 times the Sun's luminosity. The surrounding nebula is fairly typical but does shows carbon enrichment, which suggests the progenitor star was not massive but did pass through third dredge-up. The category of central star has excited a very high degree of ionization in the nebula. The shape of the nebula appears somewhat elongated, which may indicate an interaction with the surrounding interstellar matter.

The keys symbolize those kept as mementos by many Palestinians who left their homes in 1948. Such keys and the Handala are common Palestinian symbols of support for the right of return. The Palestinian right of return (, Ḥaqq al-ʿawda; , zkhut hashivah) is the political position or principle that Palestinian refugees, both first- generation refugees (c. 30,000 to 50,000 people still alive as of 2012)\\"According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency – the main body tasked with providing assistance to Palestinian refugees – there are more than 5 million refugees at present.

Formulated for the first time on 27 June 1948 by United Nations mediator Folke Bernadotte, proponents of the right of return hold that it is a sacred right, as well as a human right, whose applicability both generally and specifically to the Palestinians is protected under international law.Text at WikiSource. This view holds that those who opt not to return or for whom return is not feasible, should receive compensation in lieu. Proponents argue that Israel's position stands in contrast with its Law of Return that grants all Jews the right to settle permanently, while withholding any comparable right from Palestinians. Opponents of the right of return hold that there is no basis for it in international law, and that it is an unrealistic demand. The government of Israel does not view the admission of Palestinian refugees to their former homes in Israel as a right, but rather as a political issue to be resolved as part of a final peace settlement.  Background  = Overview = The number of Palestinian refugees of the 1948 war is estimated at between 700,000 and 800,000, and another 280,000 to 350,000 people were refugees of the 1967 war.Yiftachel, 2006, p. 58.Kimmerling, 2003, p. 23.McDowall, 1989, p. 84.Bowker, 2003, p. 81. Approximately 120,000–170,000 among the 1967 refugees are believed to have also been refugees from the 1948 war, fleeing a second time. 'Refugees Into Citizens: Palestinians and the End of the Arab-Israeli Conflict' pg.17 By Donna E. Arzt, Today, the estimated number of Palestinian refugees exceeds four million. The right of return has been of great importance to Palestinians since then. The first formal move towards the recognition of a right of return was in UN General Assembly Resolution 194 passed on 11 December 1948 which provided (Article 11): UN General Assembly Resolution 3236, passed on 22 November 1974 declared the right of return to be an \\"inalienable right\\". The right of return was defined as the \\"foremost of Palestinian rights\\" at the 12th Palestine National Council meeting in 1974 when it became the first component of the Palestine Liberation Organization's trinity of inalienable rights, the others being the right of self determination and the right to an independent state.Schulz, 2003, p. 141. Israel has since the birth of the refugee problem consistently rejected that the Palestinians would have any inherent \\"right\\" of return. In June 1948, the Israeli government stated its position, which was reiterated in a letter to the United Nations on 2 August 1949, that in its view a solution to the Palestinian refugee problem must be sought, not through the return of the refugees to Israel, but through the resettlement of the Palestinian Arab refugee population in other states.UN Doc. IS/33 2 August 1948 Text of a statement made by Moshe Sharett on 1 August 1948 = 1948 Palestinian exodus = The Palestinian refugee problem started during the 1948 Palestine War, when between 700,000 and 800,000 Arabs left, fled, or were expelled from their homes in the area that would become Israel. They settled in refugee camps in Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and in the West Bank and the Gaza strip that were occupied by Transjordan and Egypt during the war. From December 1947 to March 1948, around 100,000 Palestinians left. Among them were many from the upper and middle classes from the cities, who left voluntarily, expecting to return when the situation had calmed down.Benny Morris (2004), pp.138-139. From April to July, between 250,000 and 300,000 fled in front of Haganah offensives, mainly from the towns of Haifa, Tiberias, Beit-Shean, Safed, Jaffa and Acre, that lost more than 90% of their Arab inhabitants.Benny Morris (2004), p.262 Some expulsions arose, particularly along the Tel-Aviv – Jerusalem roadBenny Morris (2004), pp.233–240. and in Eastern Galilee.Benny Morris (2004), pp.248–252. After the truce of June, about 100,000 Palestinians became refugees.Benny Morris (2004), p.448. About 50,000 inhabitants of Lydda and Ramle were expelled towards Ramallah by Israeli forces during Operation Danny,Benny Morris (2004), pp.423–436. and most others during clearing operations performed by the IDF on its rear areas.Benny Morris (2004), p.438. During Operation Dekel, the Arabs of Nazareth and South Galilee could remain in their homes.Benny Morris (2004), pp.415–423. They later formed the core of the Arab Israelis. From October to November 1948, the IDF launched Operation Yoav to chase Egyptian forces from the Negev and Operation Hiram to chase the Arab Liberation Army from North Galilee. This generated an exodus of 200,000 to 220,000 Palestinians. Here, Arabs fled fearing atrocities or were expelled if they had not fled.Benny Morris (2004), p.492. During Operation Hiram, at least nine massacres of Arabs were performed by IDF soldiers.Benny Morris, Righteous Victims – First Arab-Israeli War – Operation Yoav. After the war, from 1948 to 1950, the IDF cleared its borders, which resulted in the expulsion of around 30,000 to 40,000 Arabs.Benny Morris (2004), p.538 The UN estimated the number of refugees outside Israel at 711,000. No Arab country except Jordan has to date assimilated a significant population of Palestinian refugees, nor given them full citizenship, and many rely on economic aid from the UN or persons in other countries. It is the position of most Arab governments not to grant citizenship to the Palestinian refugees born within their borders; this policy is in part due to the wishes of these Arab states for Palestinians to be allowed to return to their homes within Israel, in part due to these states wishing to relieve themselves of the refugees. = Causes and responsibilities = The causes and responsibilities of the exodus are a matter of controversy among historians and commentators of the conflict. Although historians now agree on most of the events of that period, there is still disagreement on whether the exodus was due to a plan designed before or during the war by Zionist leaders, or whether it was an unintended result of the war.Benny Morris, 1989, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949, Cambridge University Press; Benny Morris, 1991, 1948 and after; Israel and the Palestinians, Clarendon Press, Oxford; Walid Khalidi, 1992, All That Remains: The Palestinian Villages Occupied and Depopulated by Israel in 1948, Institute for Palestine Studies; Nur Masalha, 1992, Expulsion of the Palestinians: The Concept of \\"Transfer\\" in Zionist Political Thought, Institute for Palestine Studies; Efraim Karsh, 1997, Fabricating Israeli History: The \\"New Historians\\", Cass; Benny Morris, 2004, The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, Cambridge University Press; Yoav Gelber, 2006, Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Palestinian Refugee Problem, Oxford University Press; Ilan Pappé, 2006, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, OneWorld = Absentees' property = During the Palestinian exodus, Israeli leaders decided against the return of the refugees. During her visit at Haïfa on May 1, 1948, Golda Meir declared: \\"The Jews should treat the remaining Arabs 'with civil and human equality', but 'it is not our job to worry about the return [of those who have fled]\\".Benny Morris (2004), p.311 A group consisting of \\"local authorities, the kibbutz movements, the settlement departments of the National institutions, Haganah commanders and influential figures such as Yosef Weitz and Ezra Danin started lobbying against repatriation.Benny Morris (2004), p.311. A Transfer Committee and a policy of faits accomplis were set up to prevent a refugee return.Benny Morris (2004), p.312. In July, it had become an official policy:Benny Morris (2004), p.334. \\"Absentees' property\\" was managed by Israeli government and numerous Palestinian villages were leveled. A parallel has been drawn by some commentators between the state and private restitutions made from Germany to Israel over Holocaust confiscations and the compensation due to Palestinians evicted in the formation of Israel. Others have compared Palestinians' claims for compensation to the claims of ethnic Germans who were expelled from eastern Europe in the aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II.History and the Right of Return in Israel-Palestine by David Benkof, Foreign Policy in Focus (FPIF), January 23, 2014. In 1945, of 26.4 million dunams of land in Mandate Palestine, 12.8 million was owned by Arabs, 1.5 million by Jews, 1.5 million was public land and 10.6 million constituted the desertic Beersheba district (Negev). By 1949, Israel controlled 20.5 million dunams (approx. 20,500 km2) or 78% of lands in what had been Mandate Palestine: 8% (approx. 1,650 km2) were privately controlled by Jews, 6% (approx. 1,300 km2) by Arabs, with the remaining 86% was public land.Abu Sitta, Salman (2001): From Refugees to Citizens at Home.

It is estimated that 800,000 to 1,000,000 Jews were either forced from their homes or left the Arab countries from 1948 until the early 1970s; 260,000 reached Israel between 1948 and 1951, and 600,000 by 1972.Schwartz, Adi. \\"All I wanted was justice\\" Haaretz, 10 January 2008.Malka Hillel Shulewitz, The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands, Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.Ada Aharoni \\"The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

In 2000, Bobby Brown, advisor to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Diaspora affairs and delegates from the World Jewish Congress and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations began an intensive campaign to secure official political and legal recognition of Jews from Arab lands as refugees.

UN General Assembly Resolution 194  The issue of the right of return of Palestinian refugees has been a very sensitive issue for Palestinians (and Arab countries in the region) since the creation of the refugee problem as a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. The United Nations UN General Assembly Resolution 194 which was passed on December 11, 1948 recognized the right of return for the first time. Resolution 194 also deals with the situation in the region of Palestine at that time, establishing and defining the role of the United Nations Conciliation Commission as an organization to facilitate peace in the region. = Article 11 – Palestinian Refugees = The main Article of Resolution 1948, for the purpose of this article, is Article 11 which deals with the return of refugees. Article 11 of the resolution reads: = Interpretations = The exact meaning and timing of enforcement of the resolution were disputed from the beginning. Since the late 1960s, Article 11 has increasingly been quoted by those who interpret it as a basis for the \\"right of return\\" of Palestinian refugees. Israel has always contested this reading, pointing out that the text merely states that the refugees \\"should be permitted\\" to return to their homes at the \\"earliest practicable date\\" and this recommendation applies only to those \\"wishing to ... live at peace with their neighbors\\". In particular, David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, insisted in an interview with the members of the Conciliations Commission that as long as Israel could not count on the dedication of any Arab refugees to remain \\"at peace with their neighbors\\" – a consequence, he contended, of the Arab states' unwillingness to remain at peace with the state of Israel – resettlement was not an obligation for his country.  Scope of the issue  = Supporters' viewpoints = Protester with \\"Right of Return\\" poster, Washington, DC 2009 Supporters of the right of return assert it partly based on the following sources: * \\"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.\\" Article 13(2), Universal Declaration of Human Rights (10 December 1948).Bowker, 2003, p. 99. * The Geneva Conventions of 1949. * United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3236 which \\"reaffirms also the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and property from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their return\\".Radley, K.René (1978): The Palestinian Refugees: The Right to Return in International Law.

(New York: Clarendon Press, 1990), p. 661 and human rights law confirm that the denationalization of Palestinians was illegal and that they retain the right to return to their places of origin. On March 15, 2000, a group of 100 prominent Palestinians from around the world expressed their opinion that the right of return is individual, rather than collective, and that it cannot therefore be reduced or forfeited by any representation on behalf of the Palestinians in any agreement or treaty. They argued that the right to property \\"cannot be extinguished by new sovereignty or occupation and does not have a statute of limitation\\", and asserted that \\"it is according to this principle that the European Jews claimed successfully the restitution of their lost property in World War II\\". Their declaration partly rested on the assertion that, on certain occasions, Palestinians were expelled from their homes in Israel. The declaration placed the number of towns and villages in which this occurred at 531. Some libertarians have argued for the Palestinian right of return largely from a private property rights perspective. In \\"Property Rights and the 'Right of Return, professor Richard Ebeling writes: \\"If a settlement is reached between the Israelis and the Palestinians, justice would suggest that all legitimate property should be returned to their rightful owners and that residence by those owners on their property should be once again permitted.\\"Richard Ebeling, \\"Property Rights and the 'Right of Return'\\", Future of Freedom Foundation, May 26, 2003.

In a two-state solution framework, this would leave Israel as a bi-national state with a Jewish minority with an additional Palestinian state. Israelis see this demand as inherently contradicting the \\"two states for two peoples solution\\", and this has caused many Israelis to believe Israeli–Palestinian peace is not possible.Tackling the Intractable: Palestinian Refugees and the Search for Middle Peace, Peter Lang, Michael Chiller-Glaus, pages 99–102 Opponents of the right of return reject it partly based on the following sources: * There is no formal mechanism in international law to demand repatriation of refugees and their descendants in general, or Palestinians specifically. No international legislation, binding UN resolutions or agreements between Israel and the Palestinians require this. Including: * That United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 does not mention a right of return or any other arrangement as a mandatory solution, and only calls for a \\"just settlement\\" to the refugee issue. According to Ruth Lapidoth, this also includes the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab and Muslim nations.Yaffa Zilbershats (2007) p. 199 * That the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees makes no mention of descendants and that the convention ceases to apply to a person who, inter alia, has acquired a new nationality. Israeli official statements and many accounts from supporters have long claimed that the 1948 refugee crisis was instigated by the invading Arab armies who ordered Palestinian civilians to evacuate the battle zone in order to allow the Arab armies freedom to operate. Israel officially denies any responsibility for the Palestinian exodus, stating that their flight was caused by the Arab invasion.\\"Olmert Rejects Right of Return for Palestinians\\", The New York Times, 31 March 2007 Opponents of the right of return, such as Efraim Karsh say that Israel is therefore not obligated to compensate Palestinians or allow them to return. Karsh writes that the Palestinians were not the victims of a \\"Zionist grand design to dispossess them\\" but rather were \\"the aggressors in the 1948–49 war\\" and as such are responsible for the refugee problem. Karsh does not deny that some Palestinians were forcibly expelled, but places the blame for the bulk of the exodus on Palestinian and Arab elites and leaders who writes fled prior to April 1948 and caused a \\"stampede effect\\". Karsh writes that Arab leaders and/or Arab military forces drove out huge numbers of Palestinians from their homes. Karsh states that most Palestinians chose their status as refugees themselves, and therefore Israel is therefore absolved of responsibility. Benny Morris argues that the newly formed Israeli state viewed, and rightly so in his view, the Palestinian refugees as enemies \\"who had just attacked the Jewish community\\" and if they were allowed to return could form a fifth column. He views the refugee problem as consequence of a war that they instigated. Some critics of the Palestinian right of return also argue that it is not supported by international precedent, drawing attention to the 758,000–866,000 Jews were expelled, fled or emigrated from the Arab Middle East and North Africa between 1945 and 1956, with property losses of $1 billion. These critics argue that since these refugees were neither compensated nor allowed return—to no objection on the part of Arab leaders or international legal authorities—the international community had accepted this migration of Jews as fait accompli, and thereby set legal precedent in the region against a right of return.Howard Sachar. A History of Israel from the Rise of Zionism to Our Time. New York. 1976. pp. 440–441. . Former Israeli foreign minister Moshe Sharett asserted that the migration of refugees between Israel and the Arab world essentially constituted a population exchange. He argued that precedent, such as the exchange of 2.5 million people between Poland and the Soviet Union, as well as the 13 million Hindus and Muslims who crossed the India–Pakistan border, showed that international law neither requires nor expects the reversal of population exchanges. He further argued that precedent does not require reversal even of one-directional refugee migrations, such as the expulsion of 900,000 Germans from Czechoslovakia following World War II. In Sharett's view, Israel was singled out as the exception to international law. Ruth Lapidoth has argued that U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194 does not specify a \\"right\\", but rather says refugees \\"should\\" be allowed to return. She has also noted that General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding on member states, and that this particular resolution based its recommendations on two conditions: that refugees wish to return, and that they be willing to \\"live at peace with their neighbors\\". She argues that the latter condition is unfulfilled, citing the actions of Palestinian militant groups. She concludes that Palestinian refugees have right to seek a negotiated compensation, but not a \\"right of return\\". According to Lapidoth, Stig Jägerskiöld in 1966 said that the right of return was intended as an individual and not a collective right, and that \\"there was no intention here to address the claims of masses of people who have been displaced as a by-product of war or by political transfers of territory or population, such as the relocation of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe during and after the Second World War, the flight of the Palestinians from what became Israel, or the movement of Jews from the Arab countries\\".Lawand, Kathleen.

Andrew Kent, a Professor at Fordham University Law School, argues that Israel is not obligated to accept a Palestinian right of return, as international law at the time the 1948 Palestinian exodus occurred did not render Israeli actions illegal, with documents cited by proponents of the right of return such as the Fourth Geneva Convention and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights coming into force after the Palestinian exodus had taken place. Kent argues that these documents do not apply, as international law almost never applies retroactively. Kent concedes that international law almost certainly would mandate a right of return if a refugee displacement under similar circumstances were to occur today.http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1050&context;=jil Anthony Oberschall has argued that a full right of return by refugees and their descendants to their original homes would create chaos as the original Palestinian villages no longer exist and in their place are Israeli homes and property, writing that \\"the townhouses, villages, farms, olive groves, and pastures of 1948 do not exist anymore. They have become Israeli towns, apartment blocks, shopping centers, industrial parks, agribusinesses, and highways.\\" He further argues that a settlement between two warring people would ideally have a separation between them and their respective states.Oberschall, Anthony. Conflict and Peace Building in Divided Societies: Responses to Ethnic Violence. p. 210  Bearing on the peace process  The argument over the existence of such a right has perpetuated the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the failure of the peace process is due, in large part, to the inability of the two parties to achieve a solution with justice for both sides. The majority of Palestinians consider that their homeland was lost during the establishment of Israel in 1948, and see the right of return as crucial to a peace agreement with Israel, even if the vast majority of surviving refugees and their descendants do not exercise that right. The Palestinians consider the vast majority of refugees as victims of Israeli ethnic cleansing during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, and cite massacres such as Deir Yassin. All Palestinian political and militant groups, both Islamist and socialist, strongly support a right of return. The Palestinian National Authority views the right of return as a non-negotiable right. Almost all Israeli Jews oppose a literal right of return for Palestinian refugees on the grounds that allowing such an influx of Palestinians would render Jews a minority in Israel, thus transforming Israel into an Arab-Muslim state. In addition to the right-wing and center, a majority of the Israeli left, including the far-left, opposes the right of return on these grounds. The Israeli left is generally open to compromise on the issue, and supports resolving it by means such as financial compensation, family reunification initiatives, and the admittance of a highly limited number of refugees to Israel, but is opposed to a full right of return.\\"Resolving the Refugee Question: Key Issues.\\" McGill Faculty of Arts. 16 June 2008. The vast majority of Israelis believe that all or almost all of the refugees should be resettled in a Palestinian state, their countries of residence, or third-party countries. The Israeli political leadership has consistently opposed the right of return, but it has made offers of compensation, assistance in resettlement, and return for an extremely limited number of refugees based on family reunification or humanitarian considerations during peace talks. Israel's first offer of any limited right of return came at the 1949 Lausanne Conference, when it offered to allow 100,000 refugees to return, though not necessarily to their homes, including 25,000 who had returned surreptitiously and 10,000 family-reunion cases. The proposal was conditioned on a peace treaty that would allow Israel to retain territory it had captured which had been allocated to a proposed Palestinian state, and the Arab states absorbing the remaining 550,000–650,000 refugees. The Arabs rejected the proposal on both moral and political grounds, and Israel quickly withdrew its limited offer. At the 2000 Camp David summit 52 years following Israeli independence, Israel offered to set up an international fund for the compensation for the property which had been lost by 1948 Palestinian refugees, to which Israel would contribute. Israel offered to allow 100,000 refugees to return on the basis of humanitarian considerations or family reunification. All other refugees would be resettled in their present places of residents, the Palestinian state, or in third-party countries, with Israel contributing $30 billion to fund their resettlement. During this time, most of the original refugees had already died without any compensation. Israel demanded that in exchange, Arafat forever abandon the right of return, and Arafat's refusal has been cited as one of the leading causes of the summit's failure. The Palestinian right of return had been one of the issues whose solution had been deferred until the \\"final status agreement\\" in the Oslo Accords of 1993. Not only was there no final status agreement, but the Oslo process itself broke down, and its failure was a major cause of the Second Intifada and the continuing violence. In 2003, during the Road map for peace, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom stated that the establishment of a Palestinian state was conditional upon waiving the right of return. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that the Palestinian Authority must also drop its demand for the right of return, calling it \\"a recipe for Israel's destruction\\". In 2008 the Palestinian Authority issued a statement \\"calling on all Palestinians living abroad to converge on Israel by land, sea and air\\" to mark Israel's 60 anniversary.http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1205420712985&pagename;=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull  Historic attempts at resolution  Identification Card of Ahmad Said, a Palestinian refugee Since the Palestinian exodus of 1948, there have been many attempts to resolve the right of return dispute. These have produced minor results at best. In 1949, Mark Etheridge, the American representative to the United Nations Conciliation Commission (UNCC), suggested that Israel agree to grant full citizenship to the 70,000 Arab residents in the Gaza Strip, as well as its 200,000 refugees, on the condition that the Gaza Strip—then part of Egypt—be incorporated into Israel. Israel's delegation to the UNCC accepted this offer, although this plan was rejected and criticized by Arab government, the United States, and even Israel's own government.Joseph B. Schechtman, The Refugees in the World (New York: Barnes, 1963), p. 212-3. In the Lausanne Conference, Israel announced to the UNCC on August 3, 1949, that it would allow up to 100,000 Palestinian refugees to return into Israel. But this plan was not designed as a panacea for the refugee crisis. Rather, it was to \\"form a part of a general plan for resettlement of refugees which would be established by a special organ to be created … by the United Nations.\\" Israel reserved the right to permit settlement of the refugees only in areas in which settlement would not be detrimental to the security and economy of the state. The UNCC and Arab governments communicated unofficially at the matter. The Arab governments agreed to the offer, but under drastically different terms: that it apply only to the area originally allotted to Israel under the Partition Plan, that all refugees originating from areas allotted to Arabs or under international control be immediately allowed to return to their homes, and that Israel exercise no control over the location of resettlement. Since the parties failed to agree on the terms of the measure, it died in July of the following year, as Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Sharett declared: \\"The context in which that offer was made has disappeared, and Israel is no longer bound by that offer.\\" On August 23, 1949, the United States sent Gordon R. Clapp, chairman of the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority, on the Clapp Mission. This mission was tasked with economic surveying, to estimate Arab states' capability of absorbing Palestinian refugees. This mission failed dramatically in achieving this goal. Clapp explained on February 16, 1950, in front of the American House Foreign Affairs Committee: \\"Resettlement was a subject that the Arab governments were not willing to discuss, with the exception of King Abdallah \\". The mission concluded that, although repatriation would be the best solution to the refugee question, circumstances on the ground would only allow philanthropic relief. Moreover, it recommended that this relief be limited to four small pilot projects: in Jordan, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria.Joseph B. Schechtman, The Refugees in the World (New York: Barnes, 1963), p. 214-5. On December 2, 1950, the United Nations General Assembly passed resolution 393 by a vote of 46 in favor, 0 against, 6 abstaining.Joseph B. Schechtman, The Refugees in the World (New York: Barnes, 1963), p. 219–22. This resolution allocated, for the period 1 July 1951 to 30 June 1952, \\"not less than the equivalent of $30,000,000\\" for the economic reintegration of Palestinian refugees in the Near East \\"either by repatriation or resettlement\\", their permanent re-establishment and removal from relief, \\"without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 11 of General Assembly Resolution 194\\"., The United Nations General Assembly, December 2, 1950. Accessed Nov 24, 2012. Toward this goal, Israel donated the equivalent of $2.8 million, and Arab states pledged almost $600,000. The United States accounted for the greatest pledge with $25 million. On November 29, 1951, John B. Blandford Jr., then director of UNRWA, proposed spending $50 million on relief for Palestinian refugees, and another $200 million on their integration into the communities where they resided. The New York Times reported that Blandford aspired to see 150,000 to 250,000 refugees resettled in Arab nations by building an economic infrastructure which would make their integration more plausible and sustainable for Arab societies. On January 26, 1952, the General Assembly accepted his proposal. In 1955, Henry Richardson Labouisse, who had by that time become UNRWA's third director, reported that \\"Resistance to self- support programmes is particularly evident in the case of large-scale development projects, since the latter inevitably appear to the refugees to carry serious political implications. Their cost, size and consequent permanence raise in the minds of the refugees the fear that to accept settlement on them will be tantamount to giving up the hope of repatriation.\\"Annual Report of the Director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, covering the period 1 July 1954 to 30 June 1955, General Assembly, Tenth Session, Document A/2978 In 2002, former representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Sari Nusseibeh proposed a settlement between Israel and Palestine which would grant Palestinians a right of return to a Palestinian state, but not to Israel. The proposal failed. The 2003 Geneva Accord, which was an agreement between individuals and not between official representatives of the government of Israel and the Palestinian people, completely relinquished the idea of a Right of Return. This document is extra-governmental and, therefore, unofficial and non-binding. In 2013 Boston University hosted the Right of Return conference.

Her students included Ivan Moravec. Ilona Štěpánová- Kurzová was the mother of pianist Pavel Štěpán.  Biography  Ilona Štěpánová-Kurzová belongs to notable representatives of the Czech piano school. To the public she is known as appreciated and popular teacher who prepared many marvellous interpreters during her life. Her amazing concert career is omitted nowadays even though Ilona Štěpánová ranked herself among the best European artists of her time. She was born as the only daughter in a family of excellent piano teachers Vilém Kurz and his wife Růžena. She was taught to play piano by her parents from a very young age. Her concert career started in Lviv, Ukraine at the age of ten with Mozart's \\"Coronation concert in D major\\" conducted by Oskar Nedbal and accompanied by the Viennese Tonkünstlerverein orchestra. This concert was repeated in Vienna and Prague. =Concert activity= Beginning in 1911 she developed extensive concert activity which lasted until the second half of the 1930s. Ilona Štěpánová inherited profession mastery to which she added her own personal contribution - deep inner experience and poetry. Summary of these qualities made her one of the most popular piano players of her time. She performed innumerable solo concerts, accompanied by notable orchestras and chamber ensembles (e. g. Czech, Ševčík's, Prague quartet etc.) in her country and abroad (performances in Poland, Germany, Austria, Holland). She included eleven piano concertos with orchestra and her general and extensive repertoire included principal works of world literature of all style periods (she was especially famous for her interpretation of Chopin's compositions). Of Czech piano literature she played mostly Josef Suk, Vítězslav Novák, Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, but also compositions of contemporary Czech authors (K. B. Jirák, B. Vomáčka). She presented premieres of many compositions: e.g. in 1919 she played the first performance of Dvořák's Piano Concerto in G minor adapted by her father Vilém Kurz, conducted by Václav Talich; at Frankfurt am Main modern music festival in 1926 she performed the world premiere of Janáček's Concertino (Czech premiere - 16 February 1926); of the Russian literature she played Prokofiev's 3rd Piano Concerto in C major in Prague in 1926. Marriage to outstanding Czech pianist, composer, teacher and musicologist Václav štěpán (1924) meant another extension of public activities for the pianist. There is movement to contemporary music and many individual concerts from the two pianos literature. =Pedagogy= Ilona Štěpánová's teaching abilities were shown since her young age and it seemed to be just natural to turn her attention to this activity. As in her concert career she achieved outstanding success in this field. After her husband's death (1944) she took the lead of the master school of Prague Conservatory students. When Vilém Kurz died she took lead of his students as well. She was professor at Academy of Music and Drama in Prague since 1946 (Ivan Moravec, Mirka Pokorná, Ilja Hurník, Anna Machová, Zdeněk Hnát, Dagmar Baloghová, Zorka Lochmanová-Zichová, Jaroslav Jiránek etc. were among her graduates). She fully concentrated on teaching for the rest of her life. Her son Pavel Štěpán became successor of family tradition. The pianist brought regard to composer's intention from Kurz school. This is shown in precise interpretation of the part and respecting composer's style, beautiful fine-sounding cantilena and brilliancy of technical performance. She enriched the Czech piano school by deep inner experience, colourfulness and plasticity of touch nuances. It enabled her complete loosening of entire playing apparatus combined with conscious fixing of some of its parts where certain kind of touch - according to character of the expected sound - demands this. = Publications = Dvořák'sPiano Concerto in G minor op.33 remarked of Vilém Kurz 9 November 1919, Ilona Kurzová, Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Václav Talich Technical studies anthology by Ilona Štěpánová \\"Piano technique\\" [Klavírní technika] (Prague 1979; new publications are being prepared) completed with methodical explanation which extends Kurz's \\"Technical fundamentals of piano play\\" [Technické základy klavírní hry] (Prague 1924) which it quotes in some parts.

It was founded during a secret meeting in Seoul in 1925. The Governor-General of Korea had banned communist parties under the Peace Preservation Law (see History of Korea), so the party had to operate in a clandestine manner. The leaders of the party were Kim Yong-bom and Pak Hon-yong. The party became the Korean section of the Communist International at the 6th congress of the international in August–September 1928. But after only a few months as the Korean Comintern section, the perpetual feuds between rival factions that had plagued the party from its foundation led the Comintern to disband the Communist Party of Korea in December the same year. However, the party continued to exist through various party cells. Some communists, like Kim Il- sung went into exile in China, where they joined the Communist Party of China. In the early 1930s Korean and Chinese communists began guerrilla activity against the Japanese forces. After liberation in 1945, the situation for the Korean communists changed considerably. The country was divided into United States and Soviet occupation zones, and the working conditions for the party were very different in the two zones. In the South, the party leader Pak Hon- yong, who had been a resistance fighter, and became active in Seoul upon his release in 1945. He reorganized a Central Committee, of which he became the Secretary. Being based in Seoul, he had limited contact with the Soviet occupation forces in the north. The Soviet Red Army liberated northern Korea in August 1945. Most members of the Communist Party of Korea were in southern Korea and there were very few Communist cadres in the north. The Soviets began to rely largely on exiled communists who returned to Korea at the end of World War II as well as ethnic Koreans who were part of the large Korean community in the USSR and therefore Soviet citizens. Kim Il-sung became a prominent figure of the party in the northern areas. After his years as a guerilla leader, Kim Il-sung had moved to the Soviet Union (where historians believe his son Kim Jong-il was born in 1941) and had become a Captain in the Red Army. His battalion arrived in Pyongyang just as the Soviets were looking for a suitable person who could assume a leading role in North Korea. On October 13, 1945 the ' was established. Though technically under the control of the Seoul-based party leadership, the North Korean Bureau had little contact with Seoul and worked closely with the Soviet Civilian Authority. The first chairman of the Bureau was Kim Yong-bom who had been sent to Korea by the Comintern in the 1930s to conduct underground activity. Kim Il-sung was a member of the Bureau at its founding and replaced Kim Yong-bom as chairman in December 1945. Official North Korean historians later disputed this, claiming that Kim Il-sung had become its chairman from the onset of the Bureau. Moreover, official North Korean sources claim that the meeting was held on October 10. October 10 is regarded as the 'Party Foundation Day' in North Korea, on which Kim Il-sung formed the first genuine Marxist–Leninist party in the country. Official North Korean historians seek to downplay the role of early communist leaders like Pak Hon-yong. Official North Korean sources claim that the name of the Bureau was changed to 'Organizational Committee of the Communist Party of North Korea' (often simply referred to as the 'Communist Party of North Korea'). On July 22, 1946, the North Korea Bureau joined with the New People's Party of Korea, the Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party (supporters of an influential religious movement) to form the North Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front. On July 29, 1946 the New People's Party and the North Korea Bureau held a joint plenum of the Central Committees of both parties and agreed to merge into a single entity. A founding conference of the Workers' Party of North Korea was held on August 28–30. The remainder of the party, still functioning in the southern areas, worked under the name of Communist Party of South Korea. The party merged with the southern remainder of the New People's Party and a faction of the People's Party of Korea (the so-called forty-eighters), founding the Workers' Party of South Korea on November 23, 1946.

It is now a historic museum property, operated by Historic New England, and is open to the public. History Casey Farm occupies a tract of land that has been undivided in 300 years of ownership. It extends the full width of the neck of land between the Narrow River and the West Passage of Narragansett Bay. Its main house was built c. 1725-50 by Daniel Coggeshall, and became Silas Casey's when he married Coggeshall's daughter. The property remained in the hands of Casey descendants until it was given to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (SPNEA, now Historic New England). The farm produced food for local and foreign markets. Located near Newport, Rhode Island Casey Farm had access to materials imported from England, enabling its early owners to live in a fashionable manner. Prosperity ended with the burning of Newport during the American Revolutionary War, and the farm settled into a pattern of absentee ownership. Starting in the mid 19th century, the Casey family began to improve the farm. They leased the property to tenant farmers but retained two rooms in the house for their own occasional summer use, as they had come to regard the farm as their ancestral home. Casey Farm was also the summer home and subsequently the burial place of Civil War general Silas Casey, military engineer Thomas Lincoln Casey and Washington, D.C. architect Edward Pearce Casey. In 1955 the farm and Casey family papers were donated to the preservation organization Historic New England. Visiting today Today, hired farm hands raise organic vegetables, herbs, and flowers for subscribing households in a Community Supported Agriculture program. The guided tour includes the farmyard and cemetery, where six generations of Caseys are buried. The farm is owned by Historic New England. The education personnel at Casey Farm also offer numerous programs for children during the school year and the summer. Staff members, which Historic New England calls \\"farm teachers,\\" host various programs in the fall and springtime for schoolchildren. Casey Farm also partners with schools across Rhode Island by giving teachers and their students the opportunity to raise and hatch chicks in incubators each year. They call this partnership \\"Project Chick.\\" During the summer, Historic New England has various summer camp offerings at Casey Farm for children between the ages of 3 and 13.

Captain Augustus C. Dodds was appointed as first Chief Probation Officer of Los Angeles County.History of the Department, Los Angeles County Probation Department. The first juvenile detention facility, now known as Central Juvenile Hall, was established on Eastlake Avenue in the City of Los Angeles in 1912. Also in 1912, the new Los Angeles County Charter made the county probation officer a county administrative officer and brought all Department employees under the merit system. The El Retiro School for Girls was established in Sylmar in 1919. By 1920, the department had 27 deputy probation officers, handling 1,893 Juvenile Court petitions and 690 adult cases each month. In 1921, W.H. Holland was named chief probation officer. In 1928, the department opened its first branch office, in Long Beach. In 1931, Kenyon J. Scudder was appointed chief probation officer. The department began its forestry camp program and established the first Community Coordination Council, initiatives which later was models for the California Conservation Corps and other programs. In 1935, the department opened its second branch area office, in Pasadena. In 1938, probation services were extended to Los Angeles Municipal Courts. In 1939, Karl Holton was appointed chief probation officer; he left in 1943 to assume the position of first director of the newly created California Youth Authority; John M. Zuck was appointed to replace him. By 1940, the department has 108 staff members handling 4,063 juvenile and 5,299 adult probation cases. The 1940s saw the creation of the Groups Guidance program to work with juvenile gangs. In 1946, a year-long Deputy Probation Officer Trainee program was established. In 1952, Karl Holton returned to the department as chief probation officer and \\"instituted full-scale reorganization and decentralization of the department,\\" with numerous area offices opening countywide. In 1954, Harold R. Muntz was appointed new chief deputy probation officer. Los Padrinos, the second juvenile hall, opened in 1957, and responsibility for juvenile halls was officially transferred to the Probation Department from the old Probation Committee. In 1960, the department had grown to have 2,200 staff members, and reorganized itself into four divisions: Field Services, Juvenile Facilities, Administrative Services and a Medical Division. Five hundred Field Services deputy probation officers \\"investigated 25,000 adult and 16,500 juvenile cases each year and supervised 24,500 adult and 15,000 juvenile probationers from 11 area offices,\\" and an additional hundred deputies \\"worked with almost 1,000 boys in 10 camps.\\" In 1961, the California State Legislature adopted juvenile court reform laws, following recommendations from the Governor's Commission, in the first major reform since 1903. In 1962, the Department's headquarters moved to the new Los Angeles County Hall of Records at Civic Center, and Leland C. Carter was appointed chief probation officer. In 1965, the Department opened the San Fernando Valley Juvenile Hall in the San Fernando Valley in the county's northeast, relieving overcrowding elsewhere.

It was built by Richard Clemence in 1691 and is a rare surviving example of a \\"stone ender\\", a building type first developed in the western part of England and common in colonial Rhode Island. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a historic house museum owned and operated by Historic New England. It is open Saturdays between June and mid-October. History The Irons house pictured in 1902 prior to restoration Richard Clemence, a farmer, constructed the Clemence–Irons House in 1691. Passing through a series of owners in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, the house had grown to 13 rooms by 1938, when it was purchased by Henry Sharpe and his sisters, Ellen Sharpe and Louisa Sharpe Metcalf. Additions by this time included a one-story parlor with a separate fireplace at the north end, a second lean-to with kitchen, bath and stair hall and two bedrooms, a one-story ell at the southwest corner, and a front hall and porch at the southeast corner. Nonetheless, the Sharpe family valued the age and recognized the stone-ender characteristics of the house. It commissioned Norman Isham, who had directed restoration efforts at nearby Eleazer Arnold House in 1920, to investigate the structure and restore the house to its 17th-century appearance. The house as it appears today Isham determined that the original house consisted of one-and-a-half stories with a rear lean-to and a steep gable roof. In the plan, he found evidence of four rooms on the first floor instead of the more typical one-room plan of other early stone-enders. Removing the later additions and baring the main block of non-original interior finishes, the house was rebuilt to reflect Isham's findings. The plan consists of a great room and chamber in the main block, with a kitchen and second smaller chamber in the rear lean-to. Using a combination of salvaged and new materials to recreate the original appearance of the house, Isham also commissioned furnishings made from old wood to complement the architectural reconstruction. Significant as one of the oldest houses in Rhode Island, the Clemence–Irons House also is important as a record of mid-20th-century restoration ideas and methods.

Vehicles as mild hybrids have a parameter for the threshold speed on which the vehicle is to switch from electric propulsion to the internal combustion engine. Introducing a higher speed as a parameter can reduce emissions and increase fuel efficiency (although it may increase strain on the battery).Modifying key parameters in the battery management system *Pluginization of hybrid or electric vehicles. A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is a hybrid which has additional battery capacity and the ability to be recharged from an external electrical outlet. A plug-in electric vehicle is basically the same, without an extra internal combustion engine. In addition, modifications are made to the vehicle's control software. The vehicle can be used for short trips of moderate speed without needing the internal combustion engine (ICE) component of the vehicle, thereby saving fuel costs. In this mode of operation the vehicle operates as a pure battery electric vehicle with a weight penalty (the ICE). The long range and additional power of the ICE power train is available when needed. *Electric vehicle conversion. An electric vehicle conversion is the modification of a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) driven vehicle to battery electric propulsion, creating a battery electric vehicle. In some cases the vehicle may be built by the converter, or assembled from a kit car. In some countries, the user can choose to buy a converted vehicle of any model in the automaker dealerships only paying the cost of the batteries and motor, with no installation costs (it is called preconversion or previous conversion). * Modifying the engine to run an alternative fuel. These include natural gas conversion of gasoline-powered cars and Vegetable oil conversion of diesel cars. Cars with Diesel engines can be converted reasonably cheaply and easily to run on 100% vegetable oil. Vegetable oil is often cheaper and cleaner than petrodiesel, but local laws often levy harsh fines to users who fail to pay fuel taxes when acquiring their fuel outside regular distribution channels. Liquid nitrogen, Hydrogen fuel conversions and Ethanol conversions are other alternative fuel conversions that can be done with internal combustion engines. The first two will eliminate all vehicle emissions, while the third one will only slightly decrease emissions. * Replacing the internal combustion engine of a hybrid vehicle with a hydrogen fuel cell to make the vehicle completely emissionless; even in recharging mode. * Adding a hydrogen fuel cell to a battery electric vehicle to increase its driving range. * Adding more electric batteries to a battery electric vehicle to increase driving range.

Since 1942 the line has been part of the Nordland Line. The line was originally built and owned by Dunderland Iron Ore Company, which used it to freight iron ore from their mine at Storforshei to the port at Gullsmedvik. The line was built to exploit iron ore which had been discovered by Nils Persson and later sold to Edison Ore-Milling Company. Construction of the line started in 1902, it was completed two years later and revenue services started in 1906. The mine had many operating difficulties, and operations fell to a halt several times for years. With the German occupation of Norway in 1940, the Wehrmacht and Organisation Todt started building the Nordland Line, with the Dunderland Line being upgraded and connected to the mainline on 15 May 1942. After the war, the Norwegian State Railways had to carry out extensive upgrades to the line for it to meet modern standards. Route The Dunderland Line was a single track, standard gauge railway between Gullsmedvik and Storforshei.Bjerke: 92 It started at Mo i Rana Port at Gullsmedvik and ran up the Dunderland Valley until it reached Rena Mine at Storforshei, following the south shore of the river Ranaelva. After the assimilation with the Nordland Line, the sections to Gullsmedvik and Storfoshei became branch lines of the main line.Bjerke: 101 The line starts at Gullsmedvik, which is currently located from Oslo Central Station. It crosses the river of Tverråga after and had a bridge over Plura. After NSB rebuilt the line it received a series of tunnels. Starting at , the line runs through three tunnels in rapid succession: the Trolldalen Tunnel, the Reinfossen Tunnel and the Kalvhaugen Tunnel.Bjerke: 100 At the line passes through the Illhullia Tunnel. It passes through two last tunnels, the Gomea Tunnel at and the Smånesli Tunnel before reaching the mine at Storforshei.Bjerke: 102 History =Construction= Mining in Rana has taken place since it was established at Ormlia in 1799.Ryssdal: 3 Ole Tobias Olsen discovered iron ore on his farm of Nord-Dunderland, for which he registered a mining claim in 1879.Svanberg: 136 Since 1872, Olsen had been working on promoting the construction of the Nordland Line northwards from Trondheim.Svanberg: 131 In 1891, he petitioned the government to look at his claim as a source of national wealth and requested that the Nordland Line be built via the Dunderland Valley to allow shipment of the ore to the coastal port of Mo. He received a grant to carry out technical investigations for a railway. A Swedish investor took initiative to build a line up the Dunderland Valley as a private railway. Olsen was opposed to this and instead wanted a state railway. As a member of Nordland County Council, he gained the council's support to ask Parliament to finance a state-owned railway from Mo up the Dunderland Valley. The council alternatively asked for a private railway which the state had unlimited rights to redeem. The line was presumed built in such a way that would make up part of the Nordland Line when it reached Rana. Based on the redeemable private alternative, Olsen applied in 1896 for concession to build the railway. The application was supported by the municipal council, and the application emphasized that the line would be built with Norwegian capital, Norwegian management and by Norwegian workers. The county council also recommended the concession, although they asked that it be operated as a state railway. However, the concession was rejected by the state. During the 1880s, Swedish industrialist Nils Persson and his engineer Alfred Hasselbom found large deposits of ore in the Dunderland Valley. Persson secured the mining claims at and also bought land to build a railway and land to build a plant at port at Gullsmedvik. He sold the rights and land for £199,000 to Edison Ore- Milling Company, who established the subsidiary Dunderland Iron Ore Company in 1902 to build and operate the mines and facilities.Ryssdal: 4 Based on the mining laws, DIOC built a railway line to connect the mine to the port facilities,Svanberg: 359 with construction starting in 1902. The largest challenge was a cutting which had to be built through a tall ridge of a hill. Two thousand people were involved in construction. The railway was completed in 1904, easing shipments from the mine. It was officially handed over from the construction company on 1 November 1904.Bjerke: 93 Revenue service started in 1906. However, the separation method was not efficient: By 1908 only had been exported, compared to the budgeted . DIOC therefore closed operations, including the railway. The company was refinanced in 1913, allowing operations to resume. But the need for new separation technology to start operations delayed the opening because of the First World War. In 1919, lack of coal and the 1920–22 recession also caused a delay, but after that production again started. Production halted again in 1931, but resumed in 1937. British investors bought DIOC in 1938, but because of the ore's high phosphorus content, only German mills were interested in purchasing the ore. After Germany declared war on the United Kingdom on 3 September 1939, production was halted.Ryssdal: 5 =Assimilation= With the German occupation of Norway during the Second World War, construction of the Nordland Line, which by then had reached Mosjøen, became subordinate to the Wehrmacht. It contracted the work to Organisation Todt, which subcontracted German and Austrian construction companies, largely using prisoners of war as work force. The Nordland Line opened between Mosjøen and Mo i Rana on 28 February 1942.Ellingsve: 28 Originally Wehrmacht had instructed that Storforshei would be the terminus of the Nordland Line, but in January 1942 they ordered that the line should continue northwards.Ellingsve: 32 The Dunderland Line was under-dimensioned for NSB's standards, so the entire line needed to be upgraded. Major projects included replacing wooden bridges with either steel bridges or embankments, and covering the open culverts. Sections which were rebuilt included those past Tverrånes, Avakåsa, Plura, Illhullia and Gomea.Ellingsve: 37 The old line was highly susceptible to landslides, forcing NSB to rebuild parts of the line with tunnels. There were originally 45 curves with a radius of under which had to be rebuilt.Bjerke: 104 NSB started operations on the Dunderland Line on 15 May 1942. The section of the Dunderland Line from Guldsmedvik to Tverånes and from Bjørnhei to Storforshei was not included in the Nordland Line, becoming two spurs. On 12 April 1943, traffic opened on the section between Mo i Rana to Nevernes, consisting of from Mo to Tverånes, the Dunderland Line from Tverånes to Bjørnhei and the section from Bjørnhei to Nevernes. At the time, the line had a maximum permitted axle load of , and a maximum permitted speed of from Mo to Bjørnhei and to Nevernes.Ellingsve: 39 The Dunderland Line was bought by the state for 2.5 million Norwegian krone in 1947. The construction work on the Nordland Line was of poor quality, resulting in low operating speeds. NSB was therefore forced to redo large parts of the German work after the war. By 1959, NSB had used NOK 45.7 million to upgrade the section from Mo to Storforshei.

The Embassy has been representing the United States Government since the Philippines was granted independence on July 4, 1946. The Manila mission is one of the Department of State's largest posts, employing close to 300 Americans and 1,000 Foreign Service national employees. The mission also hosts the only foreign office of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which caters to some 18,000 American and Filipino veterans and their widows in the Philippines (see also Filipino Veterans Fairness Act.) Manila's Regional Printing Center provides printing and distribution services for overseas and domestic publications. Smaller branches exist in Vienna, Austria and Washington, D.C. but Manila is the flagship facility. History The chancery of the Embassy in Manila was first constructed to house the United States High Commission to the Philippines and was designed by the US Treasury Department, Procurement Division, Public Buildings Branch after considering and later rejecting a design by the notable Filipino architect Juan M. Arellano. The building is built on reclaimed land that was a gift from the Government of the Philippines and sits on more than 600 reinforced concrete piles that were sunk 60 feet into the site. The site was originally designed as a demesne along Manila Bay, which featured a revival-style mansion that took advantage of the seaside vista. It was insisted, though, that a federal-style building be built. The Chancery was completed in 1940 During World War II, after the Fall of Bataan, the property became the residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines. When the Japanese-sponsored Puppet Republic was established in 1943, the building was repainted and refurbished and served as the Embassy of Japan to the Philippines. During its recapture by Allied forces and Philippine guerrillas, the building was seriously damaged but its ballroom, among other rooms, remained intact. In October 1945, quonset huts were erected throughout the property and became known as The Courthouse, the center of the Japanese war crimes trial in the Philippines, with the ballroom serving as the courtroom and the upstairs rooms serving as holding cells. On July 4, 1946, the Philippines was granted independence by the United States and the building became known as the United States Embassy in Manila. As a testament to its battle-scarred history, its flagpole was never restored and still retains the bulletholes it sustained during the war. The chancery has also been designated as historic property by the National Historical Institute of the Philippines as well as being on the United States Secretary of State's register of culturally significant places. Embassy sections The Embassy exercises a number of functions in its representation the Government of the Philippines, including political, administrative, economic, public diplomacy, and consular affairs, that are managed under the Ambassador by counselors from the U.S. Department of State. For bilateral development projects, the managing office is the United States Agency for International Development, while military affairs are managed by Defense Attaché and the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in the Philippines.

The study started in 2002 and there are currently 7 waves of completed data and an eighth wave is currently being collected. The survey data are designed to be used for the investigation of a broad set of topics relevant to understanding the ageing process. Both objective and subjective data are collected covering themes such as health trajectories, disability and healthy life expectancy, the determinants of economic position in older age; the links between economic position, physical health, cognition and mental health; the nature and timing of retirement and post-retirement, labour market activity; household and family structure, social networks and social supports; patterns, determinants and consequences of social, civic and cultural participation and predictors of well-being. ELSA is led by Professor Andrew Steptoe and is jointly run by teams at University College London (UCL), the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), National Centre for Social Research and the University of Manchester. Funding Current funding for ELSA continues until 2020. ELSA is funded jointly by the National Institute on Aging in the US and a consortium of UK government departments coordinated by the Economic and Social Research Council. For the current grant, covering waves 7, 8, and 9, the departments making up the UK government funding consortium are: Department of Health; Department for Work and Pensions; Department for Transport. Study design and data collection The first wave of ELSA achieved a sample comprising 11,050 respondents aged 50 and over on 1 March 2002. Sample members are drawn from respondents to the Health Survey For England (HSE) and the initial data collected for that survey are subsequently linked to the ongoing ELSA measurements. For waves 3, 4, 6 and 7 refreshment samples selected from HSE 2001–04; 2006; 2009-2011; and 2011-2012 were added, respectively. The main interview takes the form of a personal interview using CAPI (computer-assisted personal interview) followed by a short self-completion questionnaire. Other components of the study include: a nurse visit involving measurements of physical function, anthropometric measurements and blood/saliva samples; a life-history interview collecting information on lifetime family circumstances, place of residence, employment and major health events prior to the baseline interview; and an end of life interview, initially adapted from US Health and Retirement Study (HRS), carried out by close friends/relatives of an eligible ELSA respondent who has died to collect information about the respondent’s circumstances in the period since the final interview and their death. Over the course of the study to date, the following data have been collected: * March 2002 - March 2003: Wave 1 Interview * June 2004 - June 2005: Wave 2 Interview + Nurse visit * May 2006 - August 2007: Wave 3 Interview * March 2007 – October 2007: Life-history interview * May 2008 - June 2009: Wave 4 Interview + Nurse visit * June 2010 - June 2011: Wave 5 Interview * May 2012 - June 2013: Wave 6 Interview + Nurse visit * June 2014 - June 2015: Wave 7 Interview * May 2016 - June 2017: Wave 8 Interview + Nurse visit * Expected to start in September 2017 - Health Cognitive Ageing Project substudy Data and findings Users registered with the Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS) can access the ELSA datasets via a web-based download service.

The inclusion of such information in ELSA has great potential to augment what is already known about how genomic variation is linked to disease risk and how certain characteristics interact to modify genetic susceptibility. In 2013/2014, the Illumina Omni 2.5–8 chip (Illumina Inc, San Diego, Ca., 560 USA) was used to perform genome-wide genotyping of around 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and related genomic features for approximately 7,400 ELSA participants. The same genotyping chip had previously been used in HRS, enabling direct comparisons of the ELSA and HRS samples to be carried out without the need for imputation-based meta- analysis. The ELSA GWAS data have been deposited in the European Genome- phenome Archive (EGA) and are available to bona fide researchers. Data access is regulated by the Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data Access METADAC committee. Related studies ELSA data is designed to be directly comparable with data from the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). There are a number of other analogous studies around the world that are concerned with aspects of ageing: * New Zealand Health, Work and Retirement Survey * Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging * WHO's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) * Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS) * The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing - TILDA (TILDA) * The Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) * The Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) * China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) * The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Health differences between England and the USA ELSA and HRS data were used to directly compare measures of health, income, and education amongst 55- to 64-year-olds in England and the US.Banks, J., M. Marmot, Z. Oldfield and J.Smith (2006), Disease and disadvantage in the United States and in England, Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 295, No. 17 (May); 2037-2045 The rates of disease (specifically heart disease, diabetes and cancer) across income groups (low, middle and high income) were significantly higher in the US than England. Differences were found not to be due to measurement or study design, risk factors such as current levels of obesity, drinking and smoking, (which were controlled for) did not explain very much of the international differences. Biomarker data confirmed that these differences in disease were real and not a result of differential reporting behaviour across countries.

Taxonomy The species was first described in 1803 in the genus Lavatera by Antonio José Cavanilles as Lavatera acerifolia. It was transferred to Malva by Friedrich Alefeld in 1862, although this was not accepted by most other botanists until much later. In 1842, the name \\"Malva acerifolia\\" had been mentioned by Wilhelm Gerhard Walpers in relation to a quite different North American species that Walpers called Sphaeralcea acerifolia (now Iliamna rivularis). On this basis, in 1998, Martin Forbes Ray published the replacement name Malva canariensis. Although this is regarded as the correct name by some sources, the International Plant Names Index treats Walpers' Malva acerifolia as erroneous so that the replacement name is unnecessary and hence superfluous and illegitimate. The Latin name acerifolia means 'maple-leaved'. Two varieties are recognised: the nominate form which is found on the western islands, and M. acerifolia var. hariensis Svent. found on the eastern islands. Common names It has been called Canary tree mallow in English. It is known as in Spanish, which translates as 'cliff mallow'. Description This plant is a small tree or shrub, which will grow to approximately 5ft. high in three or four years in cultivated. It can grow up to three metres in its native land. It is easily recognisable in situ by means of its large flowers. The branches are alternate, and the bark becomes ashy- coloured on older specimens. The leaves are also alternate. They are four to five inches in the first year, but then decrease in size to two to three in the following years, always being smaller than their petioles. The leaves have a palmately lobed shape, with five to seven, lanceolate, supple lobes, without teeth on their margins, each lobe with a corresponding vein down its centre leading to the base of the leaf. The stipules are awl-shaped. File:Lavatera acerifolia var. acerifolia (Jardín Botánico Canario Viera y Clavijo).jpgFlower of the nominate variety The flowers are axillary and solitary, with somewhat bent peduncles, these being always much longer than the leaf petioles. The calyx is glabrous; the corolla is some three inches in diameter, and has five petals (sometimes a petal may be undeveloped) which become broader towards the end. Cavanilles describes the petals as coloured light pink, with dark purple streaks near the base, and the undersides white. They have also been described as a very pallid lilac, almost white, with the base of the petals a more darker colour. The styles of the pistils and filaments of the stamens are bundled together like a column and are coloured purple. The pollen is globose and depressed in shape. There is one seed per locule, these are arranged in a wheel, with the number of seeds corresponding to the number of the stigmas, twelve to fifteen. Distribution The shrub was first collected by the French biologist Pierre Marie Auguste Broussonet on the island of Tenerife during his sojourn there at the turn of the 18th century. Broussonet was unable to complete his planned work on the flora of the island, but he sent a number of seeds to his friend Cavanilles, who described the species from plants grown from these seeds in his gardens. The nominate variety occurs on the islands of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, Gomera, La Palma in the west of the archipelago; the variety hariensis occurs on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote in the east. El Hierro is the only island in the archipelago where the species does not occur. This species arrived in the Canary Islands from a Mediterranean origin and it is more recent than the other endemics to the islands, such as Lavatera phoenicea, which colonized the islands earlier and independently from Malva acerifolia. Its closest relative is not known as there is some incongruence between chloroplast and nuclear molecular markers. Ecology It grows in the lower elevations of these islands, in dry, sunny locations. It is found growing on cliffs and in rocky scrubland. It is a somewhat ruderal species, preferring nitrogen-rich soils, especially on disturbed ground or abandoned farmland. It is pollinated by insects, especially by bees. Uses It makes a good fodder for livestock. In some parts of the Canary Islands these shrubs were traditionally cultivated as an ornamental in rural areas, but it is now found planted in urban gardens on the islands, valued for the attractive flowers, rapid growth and ease of cultivation. Conservation Legally, the regional government declared the species to be a \\"protected plant\\" in 1991 and the populations on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote were listed in the 2001 Catálogo de Especies Amenazadas de Canarias; these laws were effectively repealed with the passing of the 2010 Catálogo Canario de Especies Protegidas, in which only the variety hariensis was included with the status of endangered. It has not been assessed by the IUCN.

Typically the view will include the components (usually as pcells), metal routing tracks, vias and electrical pins. Software of this type is similar to computer aided drafting software, but is specialized for the task of integrated circuit layout. The typical flow for the layout of analog circuits might be : :1. The layout engineer receives the schematic from the designer in electrical form :2. Either the tool or the layout engineer creates a physical view of the circuit including all of the required components, wires, layers and pads. :3. The layout engineer positions the components to minimize both the area required and the negative effects of layout parasitics upon the circuit performance and also to allow efficient routing to components. :4. The layout engineer uses metal routing and other layers at times to connect all of the components, again taking care to avoid unwanted layout parasitics. :5. The layout engineer uses DRC and LVS checks to ensure that the circuit is both manufacturable and functional. Other tools in include field solver verification to check for important specs such as device resistance and sources of problems such as electromigration or too thin wires resulting in burn up of wires causing shorts or open circuits. :6. Other checks include ESD, XOR, EOS and verification with the foundry called Mebes check to ensure the boolean algorithms that generate the mask layers are done as intended. Boolean generation is quite often done in the layout editor. :Layout used to be done on sticks and yards of strings for very basic components. The advent of computers particularly mainframes and mini computers helped bring layout to the digital world of computers. In the 80's and 90's quite a bit of layout editing was done on personal pc's using such tools as IC Editors, L-Edit and others. Other layout editors use large track ball like device with clickers. Layout editors have moved mostly to the server world through the likes of Cadence Virtuoso and Mentor though some is still done through PC tools through tools such as L-Edit but sadly there is little choose from in the PC market though there are a few exceptions such as Magic and Klayout but these are mostly utilized for utility such as to view GDS files not fully powered layout editors as there once was in the 90's. :Layout Editors have grown in complexity and function to deal with the ever growing device count and issues that weren't issues before when device counts were smaller and geometries were much larger. : :Layout Editors have started to incorporate other tools to see parasitics since RF and smaller geometries have been introduced. Layout engineers are sometimes called physical designers since a lot of layout is generated by the machine in digital blocks. This is done by tools such as Cadence Encounter or Synopsys tools. Yet since a drawn wire in the layout editor is a perfectly ideal that doesn't show the reality of the physical chip geometries. Wires are actually more like imperfect strands with some areas thinner and thicker than other areas. Ends are more rounded instead of perfectly square on the layout editor. Sometimes these imperfections need to be reflected or extracted by the layout editor and fed back to the circuit designer so that they can run what is called RCX simulation to take account of these physical parasitics. : In some cases the layout engineer will request minor changes to the schematic to simplify the layout.

These agents, generally referred to as \\"celebrants\\", perform weddings, funerals, and other life ceremonies for those who do not want a traditional religious ceremony. Independent Celebrants, differ from Humanist Celebrants in that they offer free choice to all individuals regardless of an individual's theistic beliefs or lack thereof. It is important to know that in England and Wales, neither independent Celebrants or Humanist Celebrants can legalise marriage; however, just as a person collects both birth and death certificates from the registry office, the same can be done for marriage, leaving the wedding ceremony to Independent Celebrants who can offer choice for a couple's ceremony to be one that is meaningful, and not merely a legal transaction. Background Civil Celebrancy for independent community-based officiants with ideals of meaningful ceremonies started in Australia due to the initiative of the Australian statesman and Attorney-General Lionel Murphy in 1973. He had very clear ideas on how secular people were entitled to ceremonies of equal dignity and substance as those enjoyed by religious people.Messenger III, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), p.41ff In many countries, there is a division between the civil and religious aspects of marriages, and often one realm does not recognize the acts of the other. In Australia and New Zealand, there has been a long tradition of recognising civil and religious marriages as equal before the law. The same legal procedures were (and are) required by clergy, state officials, and independent civil celebrants. In the United States, however, clergy (and in some jurisdictions, the couple itself, in a self-uniting marriage,) perform legally binding weddings. However, in most states weddings not performed by such clergy or self-uniting couples must be officiated by an officer of the court, such as a judge or a justice of the peace.See for example These civil ceremonies typically are simple legal transactions. Such merely \\"legal transactions\\", except in exceptional cases, are totally rejected by civil marriage celebrants. The Murphy ideal for civil celebrants includes skill in combining poetry, prose, music, choreography and movement, storytelling and symbolism into ceremonies of substance and power. In either case many couples felt the lack of the kind of ceremony more typically associated with religious services. In the same manner, funerals and rites of passage have been traditionally the province of the church or synagogue in western culture; those of a secular or unconventionally religious bent had felt the need for authentic and honest ceremonies - especially for funerals. To meet these needs various groups arose to sponsor secular \\"ministers\\" to formulate and officiate at such rites. Existing humanist bodies (e.g. the Unitarian Universalist Association) provide ministers who act as clergy under the law and are thus empowered to perform legally binding marriages. The Celebrant USA Foundation and Institute also sponsors and coordinates celebrants separately from religious or ethical societies. The movement spread to the United States, where in 2005 Richard Pryor was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in a non- religious service led by Pam Vetter, a secular celebrant trained at the Celebrant Institute.

Together with Colonel Ivanov Zariko Amiranovich and senior lieutenant Vladimir Pachomov they insisted they were attempting to evacuate the relatives of Chechen, Russian Army collaborator Visani, who asked the Russian Army to evacuate his younger brother. After crossing the border to place explosives, they were ambushed and surrounded by separatists, after which they were repeatedly beaten, with amongst other things rifle butts. Together with Pachomov they were driven to Grozny. Torture Galkin was kept by militants in a dark cellar and given food or water and he may have been beaten by his captors. Galkins was videotaped by Pelton watching videos without being bound or abused. A month after being captured, Galkin was introduced to two men. The first man named Hasan - a commander of Shamil Basaev's secret security service and the second - Abu Movsaev - director of state security department of the self-proclaimed Ichkerian Republic. They interrogated Galkin for information, asking questions such as: \\"What are Putin's thoughts? What plans does he have on the war in the Chechen Republic?\\" Statements on Alexey Galkin by eyewitness Robert Young Pelton Robert Young Pelton reported that no evidence of Galkin's torture were present when he was interviewed, although, he was thin, emaciated and his bore bruises from being bound for so long. Pelton interviewed Galkin and asked if he had been tortured or mistreated. Galkin was nervous, and when Pelton asked him why, he said with humor that he had never been on CNN before referring to his career as a spy. Musayev twice interrupted Galkin when Pelton asked whether Galkin voluntarily confessed and whether he is afraid of something, saying that \\"You don't need to answer this question\\". Escape and publications in Novaya Gazeta In January, after the New Year, Galkin and Pachomov, were released by their captors. Having found weapons wandering alone, they encountered a group of militants and exchanged fire with them. Galkin had also received gunshot wounds to both arms. The escapees were discovered by Ryazan airborne regiment. Doctors diagnosed Galkin with four broken ribs (bone fragments also had entered into his lungs), his jaw was broken in three places and he had also suffered brain damage.

In 2019, Pope Francis conferred upon Steve and Agatha Luczo the Pontifical Order of Pope Saint Sylvester (one of five Orders of Knighthood awarded directly by the Pope), in recognition of their philanthropy. Luczo currently serves on the boards of directors of AT&T;, Morgan Stanley, and Lucille Packard Children's Hospital Stanford. He has served on the boards of directors of Microsoft Corporation (including serving on the CEO Search Committee and as Chairman of the Compensation Committee), Veritas Software, VMWare, and the World Wildlife Fund. Luczo also served on the Advisory Boards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. In 2016 Institutional Investor (magazine) ranked Luczo among the world's top 3 CEOs of IT Hardware & Electronics Manufacturing Services companies, based on the votes of sell-side analysts; in 2015 the magazine ranked him a top 3 CEO in the same category, based on buy-side analysts' votes, and in 2014 he was ranked a top 5 CEO by sell-side analysts in the same category. Harvard Business Review has named Luczo among \\"The Best-Performing CEOs in the World\\" for several years running, including in 2017 ranking him at number 28, in 2016 at number 66, in 2015 at number 6, and in 2014 at number 34. In 2014, CNN Money named Luczo among the 5 top performing CEOs in America, In 2013 Bloomberg ranked Luczo No. 1 among its Top 20 list of technology leaders. In August, 2013, Luczo was awarded the Darjah Setia Pangkuan Negeri (DSPN), the Order of the Defender of State — Knight Commander Malaysia, which carries the title of Dato, for his contributions to the state of Penang. In 2012, Luczo was ranked 21st on Fortune Magazine's Top 50 Businesspersons of the Year.  Early life  Stephen Luczo was born on February 28, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois at Augustana Hospital. He is the youngest of three sons of Thomas and Rose Luczo. The family moved to Park Ridge in 1959, where Luczo lived until 1976 when he moved to California to attend Stanford University. Luczo attended public schools through high school and attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1975–76, before transferring to Stanford in September 1976. He holds a BA, economics and psychology, and MBA from Stanford University. In 1979, Luczo earned a BA in Economics, with honors, and also completed a major in Psychology, from Stanford University. Luczo received the Laura Myer Award for the outstanding undergraduate honors thesis in the Economics Department. His work centered on break through analysis concerning the decline in the African American fertility rate between 1890–1940. Luczo's work focused on detailed statistical analysis of census data attributes, which correlated the decline in family size as direct decisions of African Americans to address economic conditions and opportunities. While such considerations, and conclusions, had been attributed to the white decline in fertility over the same time period, prior to Luczo's work, most historians attributed the decline in African American fertility to issues related to health and disease. In addition to his work in Economics, Luczo completed all requirements for a Psychology major, while at Stanford. He specialized in Neuropsychology, and took several graduate level courses including extensive work with Karl Pribram. Luczo wrote several research papers on memory systems in the human brain, specifically addressing and supporting Pribram's thesis of holographic constructs in the human brain. Luczo returned to Stanford in 1982, where he attended the Graduate School of Business (GSB). He graduated in 1984 and concentrated his course work in finance. While at the GSB, Luczo was a co- founder (along with Robert Moog, Dave Bagshaw, and Scott Setrakian) of the Hercules Horseshoe Club (\\"HHC\\") and of the Hard Core Awards. Both activities were centered on fostering cooperation and conversation between teachers, administrators and students. Luczo still holds the record for most consecutive match wins at the HHC.  Early career  After graduating from Stanford in 1979, Luzco was hired as a staff accountant in the audit practice of Touche Ross & Co., one of the original \\"Big Eight\\" accounting firms. Luczo was the first non-accounting major hired by the firm to work in the audit group. During his first year, he was assigned to assist the City and County of San Francisco in transitioning to a new, then state of the art, mini computing system. During the transition, the City lost control over its cash and payables system, and Luczo was assigned to a 3-member special team appointed by Mayor Dianne Feinstein, to resolve the system issue, which had resulted in a $200 million discrepancy between the cash system and the payable system. The issue was resolved within 5 days and as a result, Luczo was offered the opportunity to lead system deployment at any of 5 major City Departments. Luczo left Touche Ross in 1980 to pursue the system development and deployment at the Port of San Francisco, which was transitioning from a Sperry Univac 1005 to a Microdata Minicomputer. He was responsible for managing all systems and application architecture and development for the Port, reporting to the chief financial officer. In late 1981 he was promoted to acting CFO of the Port, and resigned in August 1982 to attend the Stanford Graduate School of Business. After graduating from the Stanford GSB in 1984, Luzco joined Salomon Brothers, Inc. He attended the 1984 Salomon Brothers training program (a year before Michael Lewis, as described in Liar's Poker), and was hired into the Municipal Finance Department, and was based in San Francisco. Salomon Brothers was the leading underwriter of Municipal Bonds nationally as was the Firms West Coast office, under the leadership of Terry Atkinson. Luczo financed a wide variety of municipal projects including those for the Irvine Ranch Water District, the LA Department of Water and Power (\\"LADWOP\\"), the Metropolitan Water District of LA, the Orange County (\\"John Wayne\\") Airport, the University of Arizona, the Central Arizona Water Project, the Sisters of Providence Health Care System, and the Santa Clara Water District. Luczo was involved with over 50 financings, which provided billions of dollars of funding for important infrastructure, educational and health care projects. Stephen Luczo was the Senior managing director of the Global Technology Group of Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., an investment banking firm, from February 1992 to October 1993. Prior to joining Bear, Stearns & Co., he was an investment banker at Salomon Brothers, Inc. from 1984–1992. While at Salomon Brothers, Luczo led the investment banking team for Seagate when it acquired the Imprimis Disk Drive Unit from Control Data in 1989. Subsequent to his advisory work for Seagate, Luczo advised Control Data in the formation of Ceridian and Control Data Systems.  Seagate  Luczo joined Seagate Technology in October 1993 as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. In March 1995, he was appointed Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and chief operating officer of Seagate Software Holdings. In 1996, Luczo led the Seagate acquisition of Conner Peripherals, creating the world's largest disk drive manufacturer and completed the company's strategy of vertical integration and ownership of key disk drive components. In September 1997, he was promoted to the position of President and chief operating officer of Seagate Technology, Inc. In 1997, Seagate experienced a downturn, along with the rest of the industry, and launched a restructuring effort. In July 1998, the CEO Alan Shugart was asked to resign and Luczo became the new chief executive officer, joining the board of directors. Historically, Seagate's design centers had been organized around function, with one product line manager in charge of tracking the progress of all programs. In 1998, Luczo and CTO Tom Porter characterized the organizational redesign of design centers into core teams organized around individual projects, to meet the corporate objective of faster time to market. As the CEO, Luczo decided to increase investment in technology, and to diversify into faster-growing, higher-margin businesses. He decided to implement a highly automated platform strategy for manufacturing. Between 1997 and 2004, Seagate reduced its headcount from approximately 111,000 to approximately 50,000, rationalized its factory footprint from 24 factories to 11 factories and reduced design centers form seven to three. During this period, Seagate output increased from approximately 9 million drives per quarter to approximately 20 million drives per quarter. In May 1999, Seagate sold its Network & Storage Management Group (NSMG) to Veritas Software in return for 155 million shares of Veritas' stock. With this deal, Seagate became the largest shareholder in Veritas, with an ownership stake of more than 40%. However, the Seagate board of directors felt that the market was incredibly under pricing Seagate's stock, as was clear from a 200% increase in Veritas stock versus only a 25% increase in Seagate's stock. Luczo led the management buyout of Seagate in 2000. He believed that Seagate needed to make significant capital investments to achieve its goals. He decided to turn the company private, since disk drive producers had a hard time obtaining capital for long-term projects. In early November 1999, Luzco met with representatives of Silver Lake Partners to discuss a major restructuring of Seagate. After two failed attempts to increase Seagate's stock price and unlock its value from Veritas, Seagate's board of directors authorized Luzco to seek advice from Morgan Stanley in October 1999. In early November 1999, Morgan Stanley arranged a meeting between Seagate executives and representatives of Silver Lake Partners. On November 22, 2000, Seagate management, Veritas Software, and an investor group led by Silver Lake closed a complex deal taking Seagate private in what was at the time the largest buyout ever of a technology company. Both the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Harvard Business School have written multiple case studies on the Seagate buyout and turnaround. In addition, several leading management books have cited the Seagate turnaround in the contents. Luczo became the Chairman of the board of directors of Seagate Technology on June 19, 2002. In 2003, he accepted an invitation from the New York Stock Exchange to join its Listed Companies Advisory Committee. When the company separated the roles of chairman and CEO in 2004, Luczo resigned as the Seagate CEO on July 3, 2004, but retained his position as Chairman of the board of directors. = Return = In January 2009, Luczo was asked by the Seagate Board to return as CEO of the company, replacing Bill Watkins. As of the date of his hiring, Seagate was losing market share, facing rapidly declining revenues, was lagging in product delivery with high manufacturing costs, had an excessive operating expense structure, and had a balance sheet that was burdened with $2 billion of debt that was due within 2 years. The company's market value was less than $1.5 billion. Luczo revamped the entire management team, and quickly reorganized the company back to a functional structure after a failed attempt to organize by business units in 2007. Led by a new head of sales, Dave Mosley, a new head of operations and Development, Bob Whitmore, and a new CFO, Pat O'Malley, the team worked to address the multitude of challenges that it faced. By the end of 2009, the company had refinanced its debt, and had begun to turn around its operations. In 2010, Seagate reinstated its dividend and began a stock buyback plan. In 2011, Seagate acquired Samsung's disc drive business and entered into a multi threaded strategic relationship that included Samsung owning about 10% of Seagate. In 2012 Seagate continued to raise its dividend and repurchased nearly 30% of the company's outstanding shares. In the fiscal year ended June 2012, Seagate had achieved record revenues, record gross margins, record profits and regained its position as the largest disc drive manufacturer, and its market value had increased to over $14 billion. Balance Vector In 2004, Luczo founded Balance Vector, Inc. Balance Vector is a privately held company involved in technology and environmental investments (Trade Wins, Inc.), real estate development (Hobo Joe Land and Cattle Company), music (Talking House Productions) and film production (Balance Vector Productions) and sports ownership, with the majority of profits directed to numerous charitable causes. Through Balance Vector Productions and Verso Entertainment, Luczo and NBA star Baron Davis produced the film Crips and Bloods: Made in America, which was directed by Stacy Peralta and premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival. Luczo's Balance Vector Productions also produced the syndicated TV show, Coolfuel Roadtrip. Balance Vector Sports includes ownership interest in the Boston Celtics, the Vancouver Whitecaps FC (with Greg Kerfoot, Steve Nash and Jeff Mallet) and IndyCar Series team Luczo Dragon Racing. In addition, Balance Vector Sports has been the primary sponsor to the world champion adventure racing team from New Zealand, three-time kite surfing world champion Cindy Mosey, two-time world free skiing champion Kit DesLauriers, and big wave champion surfer Garrett McNamara. Personal life Steve Luczo is married to Agatha Relota Luczo, a fashion model who has appeared in numerous magazines including Vogue, W Magazine, Elle and Harpers Bazaar, for brand campaigns including those of Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent, Hermes, and Nina Ricci, and who has worked with fashion photographers Patrick Demarchelier, Steven Klein, Juergen Teller, David LaChapelle, and Scavullo, among others. Agatha is the author of a children's book called Carla and Leo's World of Dance. Steve and Agatha Luczo have four children: Rosalia Antonia, George Thomas, Cosimo Josip and Anica Katherine. Steve has a tattoo of Agatha's native name (Agata) on his ring finger.

Luczo's company Balance Vector has sponsored many World Championships and Pro level events such as the $75,000 purse for Maverick's Surf Contest in 2004. He has also made numerous financial contribution to charities focused on at-risk children or environmental issues such as SurfAid International. On March 19, 2007, Luczo made a $100,000 donation to the Wikimedia Foundation. He is one of the co-founders of Talking House Productions, a production company specializing in music and other audio arts programming. In May 2007 Luczo ran an entry in the Indianapolis 500 paired with Jay Penske co-owners of Luczo-Dragon Racing Ltd., their driver was Ryan Briscoe, sponsored by Symantec. Briscoe qualified 7th and finished in 5th position. The team ran six races in 2008 and will compete in the IndyCar Series full-time in 2009 with champion driver Raphael Matos.

Background A native of Paris, Tennessee, Buchanan served in the United States Navy from 1945 to 1946 and then relocated to Alabama to attend Samford University in Birmingham. After his graduation, Buchanan did graduate work at the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, before he transferred to the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1957, he graduated from the seminary and served as pastor of churches in Tennessee, Alabama, and Virginia.Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, as of April 10, 2007 Early political campaigns In 1962, Buchanan, while still an active pastor in Birmingham, was one of three unsuccessful Republican candidates for Congress. The U.S. House candidates that year ran statewide. Because state law required that voters support eight candidates for their ballot to count, the Republicans had to back five Democrats, who were technically their at-large opponents, or to write in the names of five Republicans who were not official candidates, a process that proved too burdensome to overcome.The Huntsville Times, October 2, 3, 5, 6, 1962; The New York Times, January 29, 1962, p. 14 The congressional race corresponded with the controversial admission of James Meredith, who became the first African American in history to graduate from the University of Mississippi in neighboring Mississippi. Buchanan said that the Alabama congressional delegation had responded to the desegregation crisis \\"only after intense pressure from the home folks. ... they nodded their heads 'yes' when the Kennedys asked them to, and have come back home and denied they were national Democrats.\\"The Mobile Register, October 23, 24, 26, and November 1, 1962 Buchanan led the three-candidate field in 1962 with 141,202 votes but failed to dislodge the eighth-place Democratic candidate, Representative Carl Elliott of Jasper. Buchanan was also the finance director for the resurgent Alabama Republican Party. In 1964, he was handily elected to Congress from the Birmingham-based 6th district, having unseated the 10-year incumbent Democrat, George Huddleston Jr., by a staggering 21-point margin. This was particularly shocking since the Republican Party had been more or less nonexistent in Alabama for the better part of 80 years. Indeed, most of the 6th's living residents had never been represented by a Republican before. However, Alabama voters turned against the Democrats after Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law. Partly as a result, Barry Goldwater easily carried the district en route to winning 69 percent of Alabama's popular vote. Congressional tenure Among the significant legislation passed during his tenure was the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution which clarifies and refines the office of the Vice President of the United States, the Medicare Act, which Buchanan opposed,Social Security Online, ssa.gov; accessed August 11, 2015. and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Buchanan was a moderate-to-liberal Republican. Although he had been elected over local anger at the Civil Rights Act,his tenure was marked by strong advocacy for civil rights and women's rights. In his first term, he worked with Democratic Congressman Charles Weltner to spearhead an investigation of the Ku Klux Klan. The FBI credited Buchanan and Weltner's efforts for bringing KKK membership to its lowest level since World War II. He was the first Alabama congressman to hire staff and nominate to the military academies on a bi-racial basis. As a senior member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, Buchanan helped lead the fight in 1972 in the House for enactment of the Education Act, Title IX, which requires equality for women in the programs of American colleges and universities, including athletics. He served as ranking Republican on the Equal Rights Subcommittee and the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the arts. For fourteen years, he was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he championed the rights of people behind the Iron Curtain, especially Jewish and Christian dissidents, as well as the black majorities in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. As ranking minority member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Operations, he was one of the principal authors of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. In that year he received the Honor Award, Women's Action Organization (State Department, ICA, AID) and the Honor Award \\"for commitment to the advancement of women in the Foreign Service community\\". He served as a member of the U. S. delegation to the 28th United Nations General Assembly, and to the Sixth Special Assembly, having ambassadorial rank with each appointment. He was a member of the U. S. delegation to the U. N. Human Rights Commission (1978–1980), was ranking Republican to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and was a member of the U.S. Delegation to the Belgrade Conference on the Helsinki Accords. Largely due to his liberal record and support of civil rights, Buchanan became very popular in his district, even though Democrats continued to hold most local offices in the district well into the 1980s. He was reelected seven times, rarely facing serious opposition. In 1978, however, he was challenged in the primary by a considerably more conservative Republican, Albert L. Smith Jr., a longtime party activist in the Birmingham area. Buchanan fended him off but was defeated in a rematch in 1980. Affiliations Upon leaving Congress in 1981, he was appointed by President Ronald W. Reagan as a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations. He has also served on the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Buchanan was also on the board of directors of the liberal group, People for the American Way, founded by producer Norman Lear. For many years, he served as PFAW's national chairman. In that capacity, he traveled extensively, participating in frequent debates with leaders of the Religious Right on radio, television, and various platforms throughout the United States. Appearances in the media included McNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, Crossfire, Larry King Live, Charlie Rose, and other news programs. He also spoke extensively for national organizations including the Council for the Advancement of Citizenship, the Kettering Foundation, and the Close-Up Foundation. Buchanan's numerous awards have included the National Council of Jewish Women Hannah G. Solomon Award, the Common Cause Public Service Achievement Award, the National Conference of Christians and Jews Brotherhood Award, and an award from the Self- Determination for D. C. National Coalition. He served on the Common Cause President's Council, the National Council of the U.S. United Nations Association, and the Board of Advisors and Speakers Bureau of the Close-Up Foundation. He also served as the board chairman of Fund-Balance, LLC and the Nexus Holdings Group. In 2010, Buchanan was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor for his congressional contributions to furthering the rights of women and African Americans. After his defeat, Buchanan never returned to Alabama and he lived in Bethesda, Maryland. He and his wife Betty have two daughters and three granddaughters.

The powerful Icelandic goði chieftain Gissur Þorvaldsson had returned from Norway with the Norwegian King's favour, and had settled in Flugumýri, an old homestead in Blönduhlíð in Skagafjörður where the chieftains of the Ásbirningar held their seat. Gissur was at this time engaged in making amends and settling his quarrels with the Sturlungar clan. Not all the followers of the Sturlungar were ready to forgive and forget. On 22 October 1253, Eyjólfur ofsi Þorsteinsson and his followers put Flugumýri to the torch and clashed with Gissur and his men. Eyjólfur was seeking vengeance for his expulsion from Skagafjörður and for the death of his father-in-law Sturla Sighvatsson who had died in the Battle of Örlygsstaðir at the hands of Gissur and his men. 25 people died in the ensuing fire and conflict, including Gissur's wife Gróa and their sons. Gissur himself escaped death by hiding in a barrel of sour whey and wrought vengeance on those involved, but Eyjólfur, the leader of the attackers, escaped him. Eyjólfur would later fall in the Battle of Þverá on 15 May 1255. The Flugumýri Arson lived for a long time in folk tales, and some scholars believe that it was inspired by the arson in Njáls saga (or vice versa).

He represented England twice. He then became a football manager, taking charge of clubs in England and abroad. Career Bailey joined Charlton Athletic from non-League club Gorleston in 1958, and turned professional in March 1959. He spent all his time at The Valley in the Second Division, making 151 League appearances for the club during an eight-year stay in which he also served as club captain, before moving to fellow second-tier team Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1966 for a fee of £40,000. Bailey won promotion to the First Division with Wolves in 1966–67. He went on to play a central role during the club's resurgence of the Bill McGarry era, which saw the club reach the 1972 UEFA Cup Final and win the 1974 League Cup, where he lifted the trophy as captain, after a 2–1 win over Manchester City at Wembley. After Wolves won the Second Division at the first attempt in 1977, Bailey moved to the North American Soccer League with the Minnesota Kicks for £15,000. He returned to England two years later to become player-manager of Hereford United in the Fourth Division. He served only one full season in the role, during which the club finished 14th, before leaving in October 1979. He took up the reins at former club Charlton Athletic in March 1980 and guided them to promotion from the Third Division at the first attempt in 1980–81 before moving to Brighton & Hove Albion. His one season in charge of the Seagulls brought them their highest finish to date, 13th place in the First Division. In December 1984 he tried his luck in Greece coaching the first league team of OFI Crete replacing for the rest of the season the recently resigned Greek coach Lakis Petropoulos. He later also worked as a reserve team coach at Portsmouth until dismissed in 1995. While a Charlton player, Bailey played for England at under-23 level, and won two caps for the England senior team.

The current leader of the party is Denis Martucci. The party proposed itself as the core of a refoundation of the original Christian Democracy and to effect the reunification of all the various Christian-democratic parties in Italy. It was once part of the Union centre-left coalition, but then distanced itself from it, promoting an autonomous path and becoming a minor ally of The People of Freedom, later Forza Italia. History In December Alessandro Duce (last administrative secretary of the Christian Democracy) presented a summons to the Civil Court of Rome and obtained from the then President of the Court Luigi Scotti the notification, by public proclamations, of the convocation of a new assembly to all members of the National Council of the party elected on the occasion of the 18th congress, through publication in the Official Gazette on 4 February 2002. The aim was to ascertain and declare that there had been no deliberative acts of dissolution of the Christian Democracy and that the legal representative of that party, although in a state of prorogatio, was still the same Duce. Duce was acclaimed political secretary of the party on 16 March 2002, but after a few days the Tribunal decreed that the resolutions that had changed the name of the DC were legitimate and therefore that there had been no \\"dormant\\" party since 1994. The legal events the former Christian Democrats therefore only concerned the Italian People's Party (PPI) and the United Christian Democrats (CDU), while Duce, using the old name and the symbol of the party, had violated an agreement that he too had signed in 1999 (agreement between the PPI and the CDU which sanctioned mortgage recognition, in favor of two parties, of the ownership of the name and the symbol of \\"Christian Democracy\\" and which has committed both sides not to use them and to prevent even new political formations from using them). Between June 2002 and December 2003 the party was led by Angelo Sandri. In the 2004 European Parliament election, the party ran under the banner of New Country, winning only 0.2% of the vote. This alliance was not agreed by Sandri, who was ousted by new secretary Giuseppe Pizza in July 2004, leading him to launch his own Christian Democracy. Since then there had been several disputes between Pizza and Sandri on the property of the name and the symbol, which was also claimed by the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) and especially by Rocco Buttiglione, former leader of the United Christian Democrats, who used the symbol from 1995 to 2002, before passing it to UDC. However, in November 2006, a tribunal of Rome declared Pizza's Christian Democracy as the only legitimate heir of the historical DC. This ruling was contested both by Sandri and Buttiglione. In the 2006 general election the party, which was not yet permitted to use the historical symbol of DC, formed an alliance with the Consumers' List within the Union. The alliance elected only a senator in Calabria, home-region of Giuseppe Pizza: Pietro Fuda, member of the Southern Democratic Party. In September 2007, after polling about 1% nationally in May provincial elections, several tiny centrist and Christian-democratic parties, including Veneto for the EPP led by Giorgio Carollo, began to unite under its banner. In October 2007, DC formed a federation with Veneto for the EPP and Liga Fronte Veneto, an separtist group formed by the Liga Veneta–Lega Nord fissure, however the alliance was soon disbanded. In the 2008 general election the party supported The People of Freedom (PdL). But the party was excluded by the Ministry of the Interior from the electoral competition because of the similarity of its symbol with that of UDC, only to be re-introduced ten days before the election. Since the re-printing of the election ballots would have taken more than a week, Giuseppe Pizza decided not to take part to the election, in order to avoid the postponement of the election.Pizza: «Ritiro il simbolo della Dc» Corriere della Sera Soon after the election, which was convincingly won by the centre-right, Giuseppe Pizza was appointed Under- Secretary of Education, University and Research in Berlusconi IV Cabinet. In March 2012 former DC president Darida launched a new Christian Democracy along with Gianni Fontana, Silvio Lega and Giampiero Catone. In the 2013 general election the DC made its entry into the Italian Parliament, by electing Antonio Marotta and Riccardo Gallo to the Chamber of Deputies in the PdL's list, while Pizza was not elected.Pizza: Berlusconi Uber Alles In November 2013 Pizza and other party members joined the new Forza Italia, so the party leadership was assumed by Denis Martucci, former secretary of the Piedmontese section of the party.

This controversy would be fought in court and reach the level of the United States Supreme Court in National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie. The film premiered in the US on November 17, 1981. It was shown on the Israeli Educational television in the 1980s and on German television on March 3, 1997. Plot The peace of Skokie, a comfortable suburban village located just north of Chicago, is threatened when Frank Collin (George Dzundza), a politically astute neo-Nazi organizer, selects the place as the site of his next rally. Close to 40 percent of the village’s population is Jewish, and many of them are survivors of the Holocaust. They see the march as a warning and reminder of their days as concentration camp prisoners. The Jewish community decides to stand against the rally at all costs to make sure that the Holocaust will never be forgotten or allowed to happen again. Moderate leaders Bert Silverman (Eli Wallach) and Abbot Rosen (Carl Reiner) advise the Jewish community to ignore the neo-Nazis; the strategy they put forward is \\"quarantine\\", isolating the meeting by totally ignoring the neo-Nazi presence and refusing to be provoked. They see their logic as simple: if the Jewish community refuses to acknowledge the rally and thus refuses to feed the media any publicity, the meeting will be futile and eventually forgotten. However, one citizen challenges their argument. A Holocaust survivor, Max Feldman (Danny Kaye), says that he was told to ignore the Nazis nearly 40 years ago in Germany, and before he knew it he was in a concentration camp. He says this time he will take action, and he is ready to shed blood if necessary. Led by this de facto spokesman, most members of the community agree to protest. Analysis and background The film intermixes real and fictional characters and events, including fictionalizing aspects of some of the main characters. For example, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawyer \\"Herb Lewisohn\\" (played by actor John Rubinstein) is fictional, apparently based on attorney (and later law professor) David A. Goldberger who argued the case in real life, while ACLU national lawyer Aryeh Neier (played by actor Stephen D. Newman) is a real person. Similarly, Holocaust survivor \\"Max Feldman\\" is fictional, while Holocaust survivor Sol Goldstein (played by actor David Hurst) is a real person.

She was eventually launched on 11 September 1919. Her sister ship was and they were the only four-funneled liners not built for transatlantic service. She received a refit in 1937, with her four funnels being reconfigured into two, with new Babcock-Johnson boilers, her hull lengthened, and her bow remodelled from a blunt chisel-style into a more modern, angular design. She served in the Second World War as a transport in the Mediterranean. Arundel Castle made her 211th and final voyage in 1958, leaving Cape Town on 5 December and arriving in Southampton on 19 December. On 30 December she left for Kowloon on her way to Chiap Hua, the ship breakers in Hong Kong.http://www.chiaphua.com/ When the ship arrived in Hong Kong harbour, Chiap Hua organised a lavish cocktail party on board the vessel with many of Hong Kong's dignitaries including government officials and bank executives. The ship's furnishings and accessories—including the chronometers, captain's armchair, steering wheel, crockery and sterling silver cutlery—were offered as gifts. In her career she had steamed 2,850,000 miles in peace-time service and 625,565 as a troopship.

The ancient Roman road per loca maritima, that came from Braga to Vigo, had its end in Portuguese territory there. This can be testified by the existence of two Roman bridges. Also the Roman milestone placed in Chamosinhos, dedicated to the son of Constantini Maximi has an added value to ensure this fact. The present existence of thermal fountain and that inscription suggests the way station Aquis Celenis mentioned in the Itinerary XXI of Antonine was placed in here. S. Pedro da Torre was founded in 1125 and later a strategic place during the restoration war against Castile. The Castilians built here a fortress in 1657, whose remains can still be observed. Several symbols of the resistance of the people of this parish can be found throughout. On December 14, 1900, the place of Chamosinhos, belonging to the parish of Vila Meã, was included in the parish of S. Pedro da Torre.

It currently has a strength of 1500 troops. While the guard does participate in parades and other ceremonial events, it is a fully functional combat unit. Its members are recruited from the ranks of all three branches of the Spanish Armed Forces and receive the same combat training as regular soldiers. The guard contains a diverse mix of units: a Royal Marines company from the Navy, a paratroop company from the Air Force and an infantry company from the Army, among others. Some units served in recent times in Afghanistan and Bosnia. History  Ferdinand of Aragon being escorted by Castile's Royal Guard during the swearing of the Fueros in Guernica in 1476 as Lord of Biscay The history of the Royal Guard dates back to medieval times. The senior unit and one of the oldest body guards in the world is the Corps of Gentlemen of the Chamber, the Monteros de Espinosa, dating to 1006 and created by Sancho Garcia of the House of Castile. Even before the time of the first monarch of Spain, the Catholic Monarchs formed the group called the Old Guards of Castile (Guardias Viejas de Castilla). Later on, the first monarch of Spain, Charles V ordered that a company of those guards to guard & reside in his palace, denominating it The Hundred Contines (Los Cien Continos) =Official formation= Later on, Charles V's father, Philip the Handsome arrived in Spain in 1502 brought with him his \\"Archers of Burgundy\\" aka \\"of the Blade\\". These group of Royal Guards with their Burgundian style, together with two units of halberdiers, will remain in service until the reorganization of the \\"Troops of the Royal Household\\" (Tropas de Casa Real) by Felipe V. During his reign, the royal guards were organized into: * Headquarters * Royal Guards Halberdiers * Royal Carabinier Guards * Musketeers of the Royal Guards * Guards de Corps (organized as a squadron) * Two guards infantry regiments (Wallon Guards and Guards of Spain) In the 19th century the guards were reinforced by the Spanish Marine Infantry, which formed its own unit. In 1824-25 the Guard was expanded into a full independent army group reporting to the sovereign and the Royal Military Household with two full corps following the example of France's Napoleonic Imperial Guard and Borbon Restorationist Royal Guards: * Internal Royal Guards Corps ** Halberdiers ** Guards of the Royal Household *** Guards de Corps *** Infantry units * External Royal Guards Corps ** 1st Guards Infantry Division *** 1st and 2nd Guards Infantry Brigades, organized into two to three regiments of infantry ** 1st Guards Cavalry Division *** 1st and 2nd Guards Cavalry Brigades ** Royal Horse Artillery Battery ** Train Company ** Royal Guard Company of Sappers and Miners * 2nd Guards Infantry Division (Provincial) ** Royal Guard Grenadiers Brigade ** Royal Guards Rifle Brigade In the 1840s only the internal units of the Royal Guards remained as the others were disbanded or transferred to the regular Army. In 1868 the Halberdiers stood down, only to be reformed under King Amadeo I as the Royal Guard Battalion of one infantry company and one cavalry troop and revived as a full battalion under his successor Alfonso XII. =Civil War= The guards were disbanded in 1931 as a result of the formation of the 2nd Republic & was replaced by the \\"Presidential Horse Guards Squadron\\" (Escuadrón de Escolta Presidencial), which was a cavalry formation. By 1936, it included the infantry \\"Presidential Guards Battalion” (batallón de Guardia Presidencial), which remained loyal to the Republic during the civil war. =Restoration= Under Francisco Franco, By Decree of February 4, 1949, the Military House of the Generalissimo was reorganized and on the basis of the republican formations the \\"Regiment of the Guards of His Excellency the Head of State” (Regimiento de la Guardia de Su Excelencia el Jefe del Estado), later on the \\"Guards Regiment of HE the Generalissimo\\" (Regimiento de la Guardia de S.E. el Generalísimo), was activated, which included a mounted squadron (the Guardia Mora) which was first raised from surplus personnel of the Regulares. After several reorganizations, the unit would last until Franco's death as a combined arms guard regiment. Upon Franco’s death & the ascension of King Juan Carlos as the head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces, the guard regiment was integrated into the new army under the king & formed the basis of what is now the modern day Guardia Real - the \\"Royal Guards Regiment\\" (Regimento de la Guardia Real), which is responsible to the king thru the Ministry of Defense. Reseña histórica In the 1980s it grew into a three-battalion regiment. Today it is a four battalion unit that serves as the procotol and security service of the Spanish Royal Family. Role King Juan Carlos I inspecting the Royal Guard during the 2009 Pascua Militar The primary function of the Royal guard is to provide military security for the Monarchy. In addition to protecting members of Spanish Royal Family, the present functions of the unit include the protection of foreign heads of state visiting Spain, and of royal palaces such as the Royal Palace of Madrid (Palacio Real), the Palace of El Pardo and the Palace of Zarzuela. The regiment is an active combat unit and has been deployed to Bosnia and Afghanistan. The guard regularly takes part in military exercises organized in conjunction with all three of the main branches of Spains military. It is involved in the guard mounting ceremony (Cambio de la Guardia) at the Royal Palace on the first Wednesday of every month from 12 midday to 2pm (save for July, August and September). It is present at military parades in the national capital of Madrid on official holidays including Fiesta Nacional de España and Día de la Constitución.

The push for patient safety that followed its release continues. The report was based upon analysis of multiple studies by a variety of organizations and concluded that between 44,000 to 98,000 people die each year as a result of preventable medical errors. For comparison, fewer than 50,000 people died of Alzheimer's disease and 17,000 died of illicit drug use in the same year. The report called for a comprehensive effort by health care providers, government, consumers, and others. Claiming knowledge of how to prevent these errors already existed, it set a minimum goal of 50 percent reduction in errors over the next five years. Though not currently quantified, this ambitious goal has yet to be met. Impact The report \\"brought the issues of medical error and patient safety to the forefront of national concern\\". The report has been called \\"groundbreaking\\" for suggesting that 2-4% of all deaths in the United States are caused by medical errors. The report is credited with raising awareness of the extent to which medical error was a problem. The report described that errors were not rare or isolated, and only by broad planning could they be diminished. It also described that most errors are systemic in the health care industry, and cannot be resolved at the level of individual health care providers. Responses The report had a huge impact on management of health care. As a result of the report President Bill Clinton signed Senate bill 580, the Healthcare Research and Quality Act of 1999, which renamed The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to indicate a change in focus. The bill also funded projects through that organization. Follow up The report was followed in 2001 by another widely cited Institute of Medicine report, \\"Crossing the Quality Chasm,\\" which furthers many points from the original study. Both are widely referenced. \\"To Err Is Human\\" was the inspiration for the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's 100,000 Lives Campaign , which in 2006 claimed to have prevented an estimated 124,000 deaths in a period of 18 months through patient-safety initiatives in over 3,000 hospitals.

Kweller sent a copy of Dizzy to Guitarist Nils Lofgren, who grew up with Ben's dad in Maryland. Nils was impressed with Radish and recommended them to Roger Greenawalt, who was producing Lofgren's album at the time, Damaged Goods. Greenawalt took Radish into a studio, where they recorded a demo tape which was subsequently shopped around to record labels nationwide. After an unexpected bidding war, Radish eventually signed to Mercury Records to release the album Restraining Bolt, mixed by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie.

Clark was born in Barming in Kent. He played first-class cricket for five years, appearing for Kent County Cricket Club. He was Kent's captain for the last three years of his career before retiring at the end of the 1951 season. He was President of MCC in 1977–78.Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, 2005 edition, \\"Births and Deaths of Other Notables\\", p.183. During World War Two he was a parachute instructor at Ringway during the formation of the British Airborne Forces, and was then attached to 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment, with whom he fought in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. During the attack on Sicily his glider landed in the sea and he swam to shore with 3 other survivors. He was then posted to HQ 1st Airborne Division and ended up at the bridge in Arnhem with 2 Para, where he was eventually taken prisoner. A modest man, he never mentioned his wartime service. He is likely to be best remembered for chairing the committee set up by the MCC in 1965 to \\"examine the future of county cricket in the widest possible terms and if thought fit to recommend alterations in the structure and playing conditions of the County Championship\\". The first-class counties rejected most of the recommendations made in the so-called \\"Clark Report\\", including those for reducing the County Championship to sixteen games and introducing a new one-day league, also of sixteen games. However, before many years had passed changes not dissimilar to these would be introduced. According to Mike Turner, a member of the Clark committee: \\"We started the ball rolling. The Clark Report was a great stimulus for fresh thinking.\\"Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, 1967 edition: \\"Counties reject the Clark plan\\" Clark was the tour manager of the 1970-71 English Ashes tour of Australia. The England fast bowler John Snow wrote that the tour \\"emphasised the gulf between players and administrators\\" and \\"I was sick of the biased attitude and incompetence which was apparent in cricket administration\\".Snow, p. 3. Clark was described by the England captain Ray Illingworth as \\"an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man\\" and there were soon divisions between him and the players. John Snow had bowled over 50 eight-ball overs in the First Test and was rested for the state match against Western Australia, but Clark insisted that he practice in the nets with the others. Snow bowled a couple of desultory overs and Clark berated him for five minutes after which Snow told him \\"that as far as my good conduct money was concerned he could swallow it\\" and went walkabout until the next day.Snow, pp. 93–94. Ray Illingworth smoothed things over, but after the Second Test Clark criticized both captains for cautious play, England for their short-pitched bowling and indicated that he would prefer to see Australia win 3-1 than see four more draws. Ray Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the rest of the team when they read the newspapers at the airport.Snow, p. 88. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark's influence declined.Snow, pp. 94–95. Clark's only ally was the vice-captain Colin Cowdrey, also from Kent, who became isolated as a result.Snow, p. 110. In the final Test at Sydney, Clark tried to push Illingworth back onto the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow–Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England, Illingworth said that \\"all hell would break loose\\" if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus, but this did not happen. However, Geoffrey Boycott and John Snow had to report to Lord's for a dressing down by the MCC Secretary Billy Griffith for their behaviour.Snow, p. 136. Notes References *Snow, John A.

The network was originally proposed by San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom in 2004. In late 2005, the city put out a formal request for proposals, and in April 2006 it was announced that a joint proposal by Earthlink and Google had won the bid. The San Francisco Budget Analyst completed a report that analyzes possibilities for a municipal system and critiques the proposed Google/Earthlink option. The proposal was formally scrapped by the city on 12 September 2007, citing a loss of confidence in Earthlink's financial situation.\\"San Francisco releases Digital Inclusion Strategy\\". muniwireless.com. March 3, 2007\\"EarthLink’s Citywide Wi-Fi Gamble is a Calculated Risk\\" (editorial). Teleclick.ca. Ed: Jeremy Maddock. June 6, 2006 Proposal The purpose of the proposal was to provide free, wireless Internet access throughout San Francisco that anyone with a computer and wireless access device could log into. Wireless access points would be mounted on light poles throughout the city to provide coverage. San Francisco had little money to build out their own infrastructure and so they looked for a commercial provider to build it out. A comment and proposal process was constructed with an RFI/C, or \\"Request for Information and Comment\\" and a RFP, or a \\"Request for Proposal\\". In 2005 the RFI gave the public a forum for input on how the program could work and be constructed. In 2005 through 2006 the RFP was designed to pick a provider for the project. The RFI/C and RFP processes came about as the City of San Francisco was already talking to Earthlink and Google about the project and there was concern by the public and the Board of Supervisors that the project was on a fast-track without enough public input on the project. With the end of the RFP, the Google/Earthlink partnership was in the lead to be awarded the contract. There were two primary components to the Earthlink/Google proposal: Earthlink would install and maintain the network and provide a higher speed (1 Mbit/s), paid connection. Google would be an anchor tenant on Earthlink's network, offering a free basic service (300 kbit/s). Earthlink's plan would have offered a two-tiered pricing scheme, with a discount for qualifying low-income residents.\\"Detailed analysis of EarthLink-San Francisco contract\\". Esme Vos. muniwireless.com. January 27, 2007\\"San Francisco Digital Inclusion Strategy\\" . sfgov.org.Feather - EarthLink and Google - Wireless Internet in San Francisco\\"SF Tech Connect Initiative\\" . sfgov.org. =Criticisms of proposal= The San Francisco Budget Analyst's Office has criticized the proposal, claiming that the Department of Technology and Information Services (DTIS) engaged in a biased and secretive process while crafting the proposal. DTIS's critics state that the network would provide low bandwidth, wireless-only connectivity, and that it would fail to serve its stated purpose of providing internet access to underserved communities. Studies commissioned by other San Francisco agencies show that a municipally owned, rather than privately owned option, could provide users with far superior service, at little or no cost to the end user. Some complaints were based on the fact that alternative networks were not considered during RFP phase.\\"Internet\\". Ourcity.org. (SF nonprofit campaigning for local publicly owned internet). (SF nonprofit supporting alternative broadband solutions.) =Death of the proposal= Many of the Board of Supervisors saw the proposal as the mayor's project that did not include or give a chance for input by the supervisors. These supervisors tried to slow down the process in order for public input to be made. With this effort by the supervisors and with the mayor knowing that the supervisors would be needed for final approval, the mayor's office put a non-binding proposal on the November 6, 2007 Municipal Election known as Prop J - \\"Universal Wi-Fi Declaration of Policy\\". In it, the Mayor wanted to show the Board of Supervisors that public opinion supported the project in order to push the process along. Just before the election, Earthlink killed the negotiations with the City when they could not justify the financial business model. Prop J did go on to pass in the election, but with Earthlink out of the picture, the project, as drafted in the RFI/C process, was dead. Soon after Earthlink dropped out, the mayor's office and San Francisco Department of Technology re- looked at how they could go forward with the resources at hand. During the RFI/C and RFP process, city-owned fiber was suggested by at least one participant in the process as a way to provide backbone broadband infrastructure for the City.\\"Comments to the County and City of San Francisco’s Request for Information and Comment: 'San Francisco TechConnect - Community Wireless Broadband Initiative'\\" (PDF). August 16, 2005. Tim Pozar, David Holub. Lns.com. The City has started an effort to provide Internet access to various city housing developments via city-owned fiber. At this point, more than 40 housing developments are connected via this fiber or via wireless links coming from fiber connected sites. At many of these developments, the City has also provided free wireless access via Cisco, Ubiquiti Networks and Meraki access points. Residents of the developments as well as neighbors to the developments can get free Internet access via these access points. Wireless community networks Later advances in technology made setting up wireless community networks easier and more affordable. In 2008 a startup partially funded by Google called Meraki began providing a new generation of hardware called the Meraki Mini. Technically, Meraki was not a WISP in that the Internet connectivity was provided by individual cooperative members sharing their bandwidth rather than a central service. To jump-start the effort, Meraki initially gave away the units for free. It became the dominant wireless community network in San Francisco, at its height transmitting terabytes of data per day. However, Meraki stopped expanding its network in 2009, and in 2012 was acquired by Cisco. =SFlan= SFLan, a project of the Internet Archive, constructed an experimental cooperative wireless internet service provider (WISP) that grew to approximately 50 nodes,\\"SFLan\\". using an over-the-air backbone relying on line-of-sight transmission. Noise level in the ISM bands due to proliferating and competing Wi-Fi signals made many of their long-distance links (several miles) nonfunctional. The network contracted from 50 functioning nodes in February 2007 down to four by October. They are considering changing their architecture to a fiber-and-wireless hybrid by working with the City of San Francisco and leveraging their fiber network. In 2010 MonkeyBrains, a local ISP, started a pilot wireless project in the Mission District of San Francisco. During the pilot phase, they are providing residential users free service with a nominal setup fee. The City whipsawed by corporate powers, SFLan ending their experiment, and Meraki's \\"Free the Net\\" on hold all provided MonkeyBrains with the motivation to start their 2010 free wifi in the Mission. By the End of 2010, MonkeyBrains exceeded 120Mbit/s of download and 50Mbit/s upload in their wireless pilot.\\"MonkeyBrains Wireless Division Traffic Aggregate\\". twitpic.com.

In this procedure, a monomer is dissolved in a non-reactive solvent that contains a catalyst or initiator. The reaction results in a polymer which is also soluble in the chosen solvent. Heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the solvent, and so the reaction rate is reduced. Moreover, the viscosity of the reaction mixture is reduced, not allowing autoacceleration at high monomer concentrations. Decrease of viscosity of reaction mixture by dilution also helps for the heat transfer, one of the major issues connected with polymer production as most of polymerizations are exothermic reactions. Once the maximum or desired conversion is reached, excess solvent has to be removed in order to obtain the pure polymer. Hence, solution polymerization is mainly used for applications where the presence of a solvent is desired anyway, as is the case for varnish and adhesives. Other application of polymer solutions is the manufacture of fibers by wet or dry spinning or plastic films. Disadvantages of solution polymerization are decrease of monomer and initiator concentration leading to reduction of reaction rate, lower volume utilization of reactor, additional cost of the process related to solvent recycling, toxicity and other environmental impacts of most of organic solvents. One of the major disadvantages of the solution polymerization technique is that however inert the selected solvent may be, chain transfer to the solvent cannot be completely ruled out and, hence, it is difficult to get very high molecular weight product. From common solvents, especially chlorinated hydrocarbons are susceptible to chain transfer in radical polymerization. Intensity of chain transfer for different compounds may be quantified by use of chain transfer constants and the decrease of degree of polymerization may be calculated using Mayo equation.  Industrially important polymers produced by solution polymerization Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) is manufactured by radical polymerization in dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), organic carbonates, sulfuric acid, nitric acid or water solutions of inorganic salts and converted to fibers. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyacrylamide are obtained by radical polymerization in water solution and used as thickeners, adhesives or flocculants. Acrylate and methacrylate homo- and copolymers are made by radical polymerization in toluene-acetone for coating applications. Polyethylene (HDPE, LLDPE) - some grades are made by coordination polymerization in high boiling hydrocarbone solvents (above PE solution temperature). The advantage of this process is very high propagation rate allowing fast changes of product grades. High cis polybutadiene (BR) is manufactured by coordination polymerization in hydrocarbons. Solution styrene- butadiene rubber (sSBR) is produced by anionic polymerization in hydrocarbons leading to rubber with better properties for making tires than emulsion polymerization type. Polyvinyl acetate used further for polyvinyl alcohol is manufactured by radical polymerization in methanol solution. Liquid polybutadienes are made by anionic or radical polymerization in hydrocarbon solutions. Butyl rubber (IIR) by low temperature cationic copolymerization of isobutylene with isoprene in ethylene or methylchloride solution. Aromatic polyamides (e.g. Kevlar and Nomex) are made by polycondensation in N-methyl- pyrrolidone and calcium chloride solution. This process is one of two used in the production of sodium polyacrylate, a superabsorbent polymer used in disposable diapers.

He worked in Zimbabwe for 23 years. Currently Meldrum is Africa News Editor for The Associated Press, working in Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a correspondent for The Economist and The Guardian in Zimbabwe from 1980 to May 18, 2003 before being expelled by the Zimbabwean government because the government objected to his reports exposing state torture. Biography Meldrum attended high school at Western Reserve Academy in Hudson, Ohio, graduating in 1970. He then studied history at Middlebury College and got a Masters degree from Columbia University School of Journalism in 1977. In 2004 Meldrum won the Schork Award for \\"courageous international journalism\\" from Columbia University. In his career and stay in Zimbabwe, he wrote a book Where We Have Hope: A Memoir of Zimbabwe which describes Zimbabwean events during his 23 years stay. He was at Harvard University as a Nieman Fellow in the 2007/2008 academic year where his research focused on the role of the press in Zimbabwe and South Africa.Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University From 2008-13 he taught journalism courses at Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School, including advising students on Harvard Extension's Masters in Journalism programme. Arrest and expulsion In May 2002, Meldrum was briefly jailed after the Zimbabwean government charged him with violating a statute against \\"publishing a falsehood\\" for reporting a man's claims that his wife was decapitated by Mugabe supporters (Zanu-PF) in front of her two young children. It later became evident that the man had fabricated the decapitation story. Meldrum's trial lasted two months and he could have faced two years in jail. He was defended by Zimbabwean lawyer Beatrice Mtetwa. Meldrum was acquitted and the magistrate ruled that he had acted as a responsible journalist, only to receive a deportation order. In a second legal case, a judge ruled that Meldrum, as the holder of a permit of permanent residence, had the legal right to stay and work in the country. Meldrum continued his work and exposed how a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change was beaten in police custody and later died. On May 18, 2003, Meldrum was abducted by Zimbabwean authorities and illegally expelled from Zimbabwe to South Africa where he continued to write for The Guardian on Zimbabwe and events in southern Africa. His lawyer, Beatrice Mtetwa, had obtained court orders allowing him to remain in the country but he was abducted by police and detained before being forcibly expelled from Zimbabwe.

He also appears in the game's episodic content The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, both released in 2009. He was voiced by Michael Hollick. Niko is a war veteran from Eastern Europe who, at his cousin's, Roman Bellic, insistence, moves to Liberty City, a fictional city based on New York City, to pursue the American Dream and start a new life alongside Roman. However, Niko has additional motivations to travel there, in particular to search for the man who betrayed his military unit in the war and exact revenge. Though he attempts to leave his violent past behind, Niko soon becomes entangled in a world of violence, crime, and corruption as he moves up in the criminal underworld of the city, working for various contacts in an attempt to earn enough money to secure a better lifestyle for himself and Roman, and find the traitor as soon as possible. Nationality Niko's nationality is never specified in the game, and has been a subject of some debate. Prior to the game's launch, it was believed by some that he was Russian, Serbian or Croatian. Executive producer Sam Houser spoke on the matter saying that Niko is \\"from that grey part of broken-down Eastern Europe\\", suggesting that Niko's nationality was left intentionally vague or to the interpretation of the player. Biography = Early life = Niko was born in 1978 to Milica Bellic and an unnamed father. Milica, who possesses a maternal and caring nature, regrets that her sons have been forced to endure such hardships as children, including their abusive, alcoholic father. Niko participated in an unnamed war as an infantryman, tank operator, and helicopter pilot, during which he witnessed numerous atrocities which traumatised him, leading to his cynical view on life. After his unit of fifteen men from his village were ambushed by the enemy, Niko escaped and concluded that the unit has been betrayed by one of their own soldiers. He learned that there are two other survivors, Florian Cravic and Darko Brevic, and vows to search for the traitor. After the war, Niko experienced difficulty leading a normal life, and his elder brother was killed in action. Knowing only violence, Niko turned to the Balkanic criminal underworld. Niko joined a smuggling and trafficking ring run by Russian criminal Ray Bulgarin. During one smuggling run into Italy, the boat that Niko was working on sank in the Adriatic Sea. Niko swam to safety, but Bulgarin accused him of escaping with the money. Niko later joined the merchant navy to flee from Bulgarin, befriended the crew of the Platypus cargo ship, and contemplated his cousin Roman's requests for him to come to Liberty City in the United States. = Arrival in Liberty City = Once in Liberty City in 2008, Niko quickly realises that Roman's stories of success were exaggerated: he lives in a small, decrepit apartment and owes gambling debts across the city. Niko's military skills give him an advantage over the street thugs of Liberty City. Niko protects Roman from loan sharks, and soon begins making money and contacts that can help him locate Florian within the city. His professional and personal relationships expand over the course of the game. While working for Roman's taxi company and protecting him from loan sharks, Niko meets and befriends several Broker residents, including Yardie underboss Little Jacob and car entrepreneur Brucie Kibbutz, for whom he carries out a few jobs. He is also forced to work for Vlad Glebov, Roman's Russian loan shark, in order to pay off Roman's debts, but eventually kills him after learning he slept with Roman's girlfriend Mallorie. In retaliation, Niko and Roman are kidnapped by Russian mobsters on the orders of Mikhail Faustin and Dimitri Rascalov, but the former, not bothered by Vlad's murder, releases them and employs Niko as a hitman. Niko quickly discovers Faustin's true nature after being ordered to kill the son of Kenny Petrović, the most powerful Russian mobster in Liberty City. When Petrović threatens retaliation, Dimitri convinces Niko to assassinate Faustin to make amends, but soon betrays him and brings him before Ray Bulgarin, who demands what he is owed. In the ensuing shootout, Dimitri and Bulgarin escape, while Niko kills the Russsian mobsters with Little Jacob's help. However, he and Roman later witness their apartment and taxi company being burned down by Dimitri's men. = Search for the traitor and a better life = Forced to move to the Bohan district and lay low for a while, Niko begins making new criminal contacts, including several drug dealears and the Irish mob, for whom he begins working for in an attempt to secure a better lifestyle for himself and Roman and locate Florian. In the process, he befriends Irish mobster Patrick McReary after helping him carry out a bank robbery, and discovers that his girlfriend Michelle is an undercover government agent actually named Karen, who entraps Niko into working for her agency, known only by its cover: the United Liberty Paper. Niko assassinates several known or suspected terrorists for the agency in exchange for clearing his criminal record and assistance in finding the man who betrayed his unit. With most of his employers eventually killed or arrested, Niko also works for Ray Boccino, a caporegime in the Pegorino Crime Family, whom he assists him with a major diamond deal that goes awry. Nontheless, Boccino helps Niko locate Florian, now the homosexual Bernie Crane, only to discover he is not the traitor. Afterwards, Niko carries out jobs for the Gambetti family in exchange for their help in tracking down Darko, the real traitor, and for the Pegorino family, ultimately earning the respect of Don Jimmy Pegorino, who orders Niko to kill Boccino under the suspicion that he was a police informant. He also helps Patrick kidnap the daughter of the Ancelotti family's Don to ransom her for the diamonds, but they are lost due to Bulgarin's unexpected interference. During this time, Niko continues his conflict with Dimitri; he rescues Roman after he is kidnapped by Dimitri's men, thwarts his plot to blackmail Liberty City's vice-mayor (who is secretly dating Bernie), and disrupts his drug operations during his work for the Mafia. He and Roman ultimately secure the lifestyle they sought after the latter rebuilds his taxi company and buys a new apartment in Algonquin using the insurance money from his formerly destroyed business. Roman also proposes to Mallorie, who accepts. = Tying up loose ends = Eventually, the United Liberty Paper tracks down Darko and brings him into Liberty City for Niko to decide his fate. Having achieved closure on his past, Niko is summoned by Pegorino for one final favour: to help with an extremely lucrative deal on heroin in collusion with Dimitri. Niko must either strike the deal with Dimitri, or exact revenge on him. Should Niko go through with the deal, Dimitri again betrays him and takes the heroin for himself, forcing Niko to kill the buyers and retrieve the money. At Roman's wedding, an assassin sent by Dimitri unintentionally kills Roman with a stray bullet. Aided by Little Jacob, a devastated and vengeful Niko kills Dimitri, who in turn killed Pegorino. Later, Niko is informed by Mallorie that she is pregnant with Roman's child, whom he vows to protect. Should Niko choose to exact revenge, he storms the Platypus and fights his way through Dimitri's men, ultimately killing him. At Roman's wedding, Pegorino, furious after Niko's betrayal, targets him in a drive-by shooting, but ends up accidentally killing Niko's new girlfriend, Patrick's sister Kate. Aided by Little Jacob and Roman, Niko kills Pegorino, who had been targeted by the Liberty City underworld. Later, Roman informs Niko that Mallorie is pregnant, and that if the baby is a girl, they will name her in Kate's memory. With all loose ends in his life tied up, Niko muses on the American Dream and concludes that it is a hollow promise, which no one can truly achieve. = Later life = In Grand Theft Auto V, set in 2013, Niko is briefly mentioned by Patrick, who claims he has not heard of him since 2008. Lester Crest also briefly refers to \\"an Eastern European making moves in Liberty City\\" who \\"went quiet\\", implying Niko left his life of crime behind. An easter egg in the game mentions that Niko still works for Roman’s taxi company.  Characteristics  Niko is portrayed as a very down-to-business person, and angers easily. He has a dry, sarcastic sense of humour, and often makes acerbic remarks. Though he regrets his past crimes, he feels that his soul is permanently tainted, and that killing is all he can do. Niko appears to be a more mature, empathetic, and sensible person than many of his acquaintances. His female acquaintances often point out that Niko has sophisticated manners and appears to be a very decent person. Many times he attempts to resolve conflicts between two parties without the use of violence. The most significant aspect of Niko's personality is his cynicism, which he gained in the war. Although generally he is a caring individual, Niko's realistic view of life allows him the ability to manipulate people. Niko's biggest weakness is his inability to let go of the past, and the desire for revenge is a driving force in many of his decisions. Despite his long involvement with criminal activity, Niko holds a somewhat sympathetic view of law enforcement, stating that cops are just people trying to survive. Near the end of the game, Niko expresses a desire to move on from his criminal past and get a fresh start. Niko has a distaste for drugs despite his frequent involvement in the drugs trade and regularly refuses offers of marijuana by Little Jacob. = Portrayal = Michael Hollick, voice of Niko Bellic, won a Spike TV award for \\"Best Performance by a Human Male\\" Niko Bellic is voiced by Michael Hollick. Hollick was paid about $100,000 for his voice acting and motion-capture work over the course of about 15 months from 2006 to 2007. Hollick was paid about $1,050 a day for his work on the game, about 50% more than the standard Screen Actors Guild-negotiated rate for actors, although he claimed it was still a fraction of the income he would get from a film or TV- show performance, and that he was upset about not getting residuals from game sales, putting the blame on the union for not securing such agreements. Hollick told The New York Times that while he was a theater student at Carnegie Mellon University he developed a talent for dialects. Russian actor Vladimir Mashkov claims he was in discussions with Rockstar Games to voice the character and that the character's appearance is based on him, specifically from his role of the Tracker in the 2001 movie Behind Enemy Lines, but he ultimately turned down the offer. Rockstar Games have not commented on Mashkov's claims.  Other appearances  Niko plays a minor role in both of Grand Theft Auto IVs expansion packs, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony (both 2009), which take place simultaneously with the storyline of the base game, from the perspective of Johnny Klebitz and Luis Lopez, respectively. He appears as an NPC in the missions that cross over with the base game. In The Lost and Damned, Niko appears in the missions \\"Buyer's Market\\", where he assists Johnny and Playboy X on a drug deal that goes awry, and \\"Collector's Item\\", where he oversees the diamond deal with the Jewish Mob alongside Johnny, which is ambushed by Luis. He also makes a cameo appearance in the first mission of the expansion, \\"Clean and Serene\\", walking down the streets of Alderney (although this is likely an oversight, as the mission takes place before the bridges to Alderney open in Grand Theft Auto IV, meaning Niko couldn't have possibly been there at that time). Niko is indirectly mentioned by Brian Jeremy at the end of the mission \\"It's War\\" as a \\"Polak\\" guy who killed Jason Michaels, only for Billy Grey to reply \\"I think he was a Serb\\", and then dismiss the idea, claiming that Jason was killed by the Angels of Death. In The Ballad of Gay Tony, Niko appears in the first mission, \\"I Luv LC\\", as one of the masked bank robbers holding Luis hostage during the heist of the Bank of Liberty. He appears again shortly after in that mission, almost running Luis over with his car on the pedestrian crossing. In \\"Not So Fast\\", Niko appears again alongside Johnny during the diamond deal which is ambushed by Luis. His final appearance is in \\"Ladies Half Price\\", where he and Patrick McReary attempt to exchange Gracie Ancelotti for the diamonds in Luis and Tony Prince's possession, only for the deal to be ambushed by Ray Bulgarin's men. Niko is mentioned several times in Grand Theft Auto V (2013), indirectly by Lester Crest and directly by Patrick. His LifeInvader profile also can be seen on Jimmy De Santa's laptop as an easter egg. In the \\"Collector's Edition\\" of Grand Theft Auto Online, players can choose what their character is to look like by selecting between different parents; Niko is one of the special parents available, meaning that players can select Niko so that their character has a level of resemblance to him.  Reception  Niko's character has been well received by critics, as well as by gamers. He was voted as the 14th top character of the 2000s decade by readers of Game Informer. In 2008, The Age ranked Niko as the second greatest Xbox character of all time, as \\"few characters in video game history have provided us with such a spectrum of emotions. Niko's tale is such a roller coaster ride that by the climax you'd be forgiven for feeling exhausted and perhaps even a little numb.\\" IGN's Hilary Goldstein commented \\"Niko's struggles with his ruthless nature never inhibit the gameplay, but instead enhance the emotional gravity of a brilliant storyline. The more absurd the action becomes, the greater we feel the very real pathos of Niko Bellic.\\" Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer opined Niko \\"himself is quickly sympathetic - his moral latitude is rooted in horrible war stories, but he's warm-hearted - and imposing.\\" GameDaily included him in a top 25 list of video game anti-heroes, stating that he has a heart-of-gold beneath his rough exterior. In another article, GameDaily listed the \\"scary foreigner\\" as one of their top 25 video game archetypes, using Niko as an example of this due to his \\"European thug\\" appearance. They also used him as an example for the \\"walking stereotype\\" archetype. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition voted Niko as the 13th-top video game character of all time.

He placed it in the subfamily Dolichoderinae of the family Formicidae. There are 79 described species and five fossil species. Most of these ants are native to Australia; others are found in Asia and Oceania, and they have been introduced to Brazil, New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Fossil species are known from China, France and the United States. These ants are known to be an ecologically dominant and important group of ants, but they are sometimes regarded as pests because they disturb soil and enter human houses. Farmers in rural Australia place animal carcasses on meat ant (I. purpureus) mounds as a method of disposing of them; meat ants will consume the carcass and reduce it to bones in a matter of weeks. Meat ants also engage in ritualised fighting which helps prevent casualties and solve territorial disputes between neighbouring colonies. The largest members of this genus are those of the I. purpureus species group, measuring . After their nuptial flight, queen ants may establish a colony by themselves, by budding or cooperatively, where a subset of the colony migrates to a new location or when multiple queens help find a suitable nesting spot, but they will display intolerance to each other when workers are present. The eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop into adults. The genus lives in a wide variety of habitats and nests in soil in numbers that range from a couple of hundred individuals to over 300,000 in a single colony. Depending on the species, nests are large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances while others live above ground in twig nests. In some cases, ants dwell in several nest sites connected by paths; some of these nests can extend to in length. Some species associate with caterpillars and butterflies that provide the ants with secretions and honeydew, and I. bicknelli pollinates orchids. These ants are predators and scavengers; they hunt for prey to feed their young. Notably, these ants are immune to the toxins of the cane toad and feed on the juveniles. Predators such as spiders, birds, lizards, and other ants prey on Iridomyrmex ants. Phylogeny The separation of the genus Iridomyrmex from its most recent common ancestor began around 12 million years ago. Its sister group, Froggattella, has only two species, even though both genera are the same age. In comparison to other Indo-Australian genera in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, the clade of which it is a part is 23 million years old, meaning that it is rather young. However, the fossil species that have been found are from the Eocene and Oligocene. The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic position of Iridomyrmex among the Indo-Australian genera: Taxonomy The genus Iridomyrmex was first described by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862, but it had no designated type species until 1903. By then, the type species was designated as Formica detecta, a synonym of Iridomyrmex purpureus. The genus was placed in the subfamily Dolichoderinae in 1878, the same year the subfamily was established. Since the establishment of the genus, it suffered taxonomic misunderstanding due to the gradual development of unrelated ants being designated into the genus by early researchers who failed to identify easily recognisable features that would make them distinct from the genus Iridomyrmex. Myrmecologist William Brown, Jr., was perhaps the first person to question the monophyly of the genus, mentioning that the Argentine ant, a former member of Iridomyrmex, differed from the rest of the genus. The first proper revisions of the genus began in the 1990s, and 91 species were transferred to six genera; only 62 species remained after these revisions. These species were placed into the genera Anonychomyrma, Doleromyrma, Linepithema, Ochetellus, Papyrius and Philidris. In 2011, the genus was revised again, and 79 species and five extinct species were now present, 31 of which were newly described. Four species were placed in different genera while 25 species and subspecies were classified as synonyms. According to one source, 350 Australian Iridomyrmex species may be present. The scientific name of the genus, Iridomyrmex, meaning \\"rainbow ant\\", refers to their blue-green iridescent sheen. The word Irido, meaning \\"rainbow\\", derives from Ancient Greek, and myrmex, another Greek word, means \\"ant\\". =Species= [extinct species are marked with †] *Iridomyrmex adstringatus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex agilis Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex alpinus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex anceps (Roger, 1863) *Iridomyrmex anderseni Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex angusticeps Forel, 1901 *Iridomyrmex anteroinclinus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex atypicus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex azureus Viehmeyer, 1914 *Iridomyrmex bicknelli Emery, 1898 *Iridomyrmex bigi Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex brennani Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *†Iridomyrmex breviantennis Théobald, 1937 *Iridomyrmex brunneus Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex calvus Emery, 1914 *Iridomyrmex cappoinclinus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex cephaloinclinus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex chasei Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex coeruleus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex conifer Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex continentis Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex cuneiceps Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex cupreus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex curvifrons Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex cyaneus Wheeler, 1915 *Iridomyrmex difficilis Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex discors Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex dromus Clark, 1938 *Iridomyrmex elongatus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex exsanguis Forel, 1907 *†Iridomyrmex florissantius Carpenter, 1930 *Iridomyrmex fulgens Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex galbanus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex gibbus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex gumnos Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex hartmeyeri Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex hertogi Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex hesperus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex infuscus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex innocens Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex lividus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex longisoma Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex luteoclypeatus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex macrops Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *†Iridomyrmex mapesi Wilson, 1985 *Iridomyrmex mattiroloi Emery, 1898 *Iridomyrmex mayri Forel, 1915 *Iridomyrmex meridianus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex minor Forel, 1915 *Iridomyrmex mirabilis Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex mjobergi Forel, 1915 *Iridomyrmex neocaledonica Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex niger Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex nudipes Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *†Iridomyrmex obscurans Carpenter, 1930 *Iridomyrmex obscurior Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex obsidianus Emery, 1914 *Iridomyrmex omalonotus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex pallidus Forel, 1901 *Iridomyrmex phillipensis Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex prismatis Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex purpureus (Smith, 1858) *Iridomyrmex reburrus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex roseatus Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex rubriceps Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex rufoinclinus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex rufoniger (Lowne, 1865) *Iridomyrmex sanguineus Forel, 1910 *Iridomyrmex setoconus Shattuck & McMillan, 1998 *†Iridomyrmex shandongicus Zhang, 1989 *Iridomyrmex spadius Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex splendens Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex spodipilus Shattuck, 1993 *Iridomyrmex spurcus Wheeler, 1915 *Iridomyrmex suchieri Forel, 1907 *Iridomyrmex suchieroides Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex tenebrans Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex tenuiceps Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex trigonoceps Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 *Iridomyrmex turbineus Shattuck & McMillan, 1998 *Iridomyrmex victorianus Forel, 1902 *Iridomyrmex viridiaeneus Viehmeyer, 1914 *Iridomyrmex viridigaster Clark, 1941 *Iridomyrmex xanthocoxa Heterick & Shattuck, 2011 Description Unlike other genera in Dolichoderinae, the front margin of the clypeus is not below the mandibles; instead, it is located above them. The eyes are located on top of the ants' head, and they are noticeably distant from the mandibles. These ants range from small to medium; members of the I. conifer species group measure , being reddish-brown in colour with a distinctive propodeum, while members of the I. purpureus species group are the largest at . Worker castes are rarely polymorphic. Based on observations, Iridomyrmex workers can be deformed when they are born. For example, a captured specimen had its propodeum and gaster fused together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker was still able to forage with little trouble. Distribution and habitat Occurrences of Iridomyrmex species reported in Australia as of May 2015 Ants of this genus are found in a range spanning several continents. In the Oceanian region, these ants are found in Fiji, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. In Australia, they are found in every state and territory. In New Zealand, this genus has been introduced to the country, establishing themselves in both the North Island and South Island. In Asia, they are found in Burma, East Timor, India, Malaysia and the Philippines. I. anceps is the only known ant of this genus present in the Middle East, having been introduced to the United Arab Emirates. I. rufoniger was introduced to Brazil through human activity. Populations are present on the islands of Norfolk Island and Phillip Island in Oceania. Extinct species were native to a range spanning beyond the modern distribution of the genus; fossils have been found in China, France and the United States. Meat ant mound near Bungendore, New South Wales The genus Iridomyrmex inhabits rural, arid, and semi-arid areas. Nests are found in Acacia, Agathis, Banksia, Casuarina and Eucalyptus woodland, in pastures, Callitris forests, city parks, farmlands, grasslands, heath, sand dunes, savanna woodland, swamps, urban gardens, wet rain-forests, wet and dry sclerophyll woodland, and even in buildings such as hotels and houses. Most of these ants nest in soil, but some prefer to live under rocks, rotten wood, and in some cases in sandy beaches and footpaths. Certain species will avoid nesting in sandy soil. Nests will vary in appearance; most species live in small mounds with a single entrance, while other species create large mounds covered in pebbles with multiple entrances. Some colonies are known to create \\"super-nests\\": workers construct many nests connected through established paths, extending up to in length. In one extreme case, a single colony was found to occupy over 10 hectares of land with 85 individual nests and 1,500 entrance holes. While meat ants are never aggressive to their nest mates, they will be aggressive to those who live in different nests within the same colony. Nests may be above or below ground, with some species such as I. conifer alternating between the two; during winter, nests will be constructed above in twigs, with the ants moving back underground during the warmer months. Underground nests are located near areas where food sources are present. Colonies will relocate their nests to areas where there are reasonable levels of sunlight during winter. Behaviour and ecology While most Iridomyrmex species are notable for their aggression, some are quite timid. This worker is moving pupae to a safer location instead of attacking intruders after the nest was exposed. Most Iridomyrmex species are aggressive ants that will attack anything which attacks or disturbs their nests or trails they forage on. This is noticeable with particular member species of the I. purpureus species group, where they will pour out of their nest and attack and kill all intruders. Even smaller species show similar behaviours to these ants and will also swarm out of their nests to bite and spray iridomyrmecin, a defensive chemical found in the genus. Because of their large numbers, aggression, and activeness, Iridomyrmex ants are ecologically dominant in Australia, and several species are known to obtain exclusive possession to food sources and prevent other insects from using them. These ants will also affect foraging behaviours of other ant nests living nearby due to how active they are and their large numbers. While Iridomyrmex ants are known for their aggression, some are more timid and shy; workers will run and hide if they are disturbed and avoid contact with other ant species. When nests are disturbed, workers will not attack; instead, they will relocate their brood and disregard other disturbances should they occur. Workers will hide in leaves and other vegetation, and in some cases, I. victorianus workers may remain still until any threat or danger subsides. Meat ants engage in ritualised fights to maintain and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants do this in a display of size matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare. =Foraging= All species are predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and butterfly larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation to look for food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not be placed in a shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise. =Diet= Iridomyrmex with a captured termite Iridomyrmex primarily feeds on sweet foods such as nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them a better chance of survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to the toxins released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on guano. =Predators= Some invertebrate species specialise in predation of Iridomyrmex ants. One spider in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and will use the alarm pheromones that are released by the ants during territorial disputes to locate them. The Australian thorny devil lizard (Moloch horridus) is a sit and wait predator that primarily preys on Iridomyrmex ants, and one lizard will reject specific species in this genus while eating others. The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follows trails laid by these ants to locate them as a potential prey species and will eat the broods of some species, while ground beetles dig burrows near ant nests to prey on workers passing by. A prominent predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that eats the virgin queens during nuptial flight due to their high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when the winged females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex. =Life cycle and reproduction= Meat eater ant nest during swarming Nuptial flight occurs throughout the year in humid and warm climates. The alates begin to emerge from their nest and immediately climb onto tall structures (such as tree trunks, fence-posts, or long flora) where they begin to fly and copulate. Depending on the species, a queen either mates with a single male or with multiple males. Observations show that meat ant males begin to fly first, followed by the queens. Groups of 20 to 40 queens will approach the top of the nest and fly once they are warm enough, and this would proceed multiple times for many days until the climate changes or all of the queens have withdrawn from the nest. After mating, the males soon die and the queens proceed to search for a suitable nest to establish her colony. Finding a location to nest is dangerous, as birds and other ants prey on them; disease and starvation are other causes of death in queens. While most queens will establish a nest by herself, nests can be established when queens cooperate with each other, are adopted into an existing colony, or by \\"budding\\" (also called \\"satelliting\\" or \\"fractionating\\"), where a subset of the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site. 10% of queens will cooperate with another queen during colony foundation. Fertilised meat-eater ant queen beginning to dig a new colony Once a queen has excavated a chamber, she will lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae in less than a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of workers is present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size. Symbiosis I. rufoniger worker tending to a scale insect Iridomyrmex ants share symbiotic relationships with many caterpillars, aphids and coccids. Workers protect these caterpillars and will sometimes take them to their feeding chambers inside the nest. In the genus Jalmenus, workers attend to the butterflies Jalmenus clementi (turquoise hairstreak), Jalmenus daemeli (emerald hairstreak), Jalmenus eichhorni (northern hairstreak),Jalmenus evagoras (imperial hairstreak) Jalmenus icilius (amethyst hairstreak), Jalmenus inous (varied hairstreak) and Jalmenus lithochroa (Waterhouse's hairstreak). In the genus Ogyris, attendants include Ogyris amaryllis (satin azure), Ogyris olane (olane azure) and Ogyris oroetes (silky azure). Additional species workers attend include Anthene lycaenoides (pale ciliate blue), Candalides heathi (rayed blue), Candalides margarita (trident pencil-blue), Deudorix diovis (bright cornelian), Euchrysops cnejus (gram blue), Lampides boeticus (pea blue), Leptotes plinius (plumbago blue), Lucia limbaria (chequered copper), Nesolycaena caesia (Kimberly spotted opal), Neolucia agricola (fringed heath-blue) and Theclinesthes serpentata (saltbush blue). I. bicknelli is an effective pollinator of Microtis parviflora, and one study suggests the pollen is not harmed by contact of these ants. Meat ants have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during the early hours of the day. The ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Interaction with humans In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers as they place animal carcasses on their nests. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass will be consumed and reduced to bones. However, Iridomyrmex ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants entering human houses to feed on food and soil disturbance. Eradication of nests can be difficult, as nests can be repopulated from a rival colony or adjoining nests which were not affected. Particular species have adapted rather well to urbanisation; during the early days in Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants, and populations flourished. Other factors include plantations enriched with valuable food sources and home gardens. Workers also cause problems for those who are Citrus producers; they will affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce honeydew.

Kennefick joined the team during the 1942 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his forced retirement due to injury during the 1944 championship. During that time he won two All-Ireland medals and two Munster medals. Kennefick captained Cork to the All-Ireland title in 1943. At club level Kennefick was a two-time county club championship medalist with St. Finbarr's. His father, Dan Kennefick, also played hurling for Cork. Playing career =Club= Kennefick played his club hurling with St. Finbarr's and enjoyed much success. He first played for the famous \\"Barr's\\" club in the minor grade and collected three successive championship medals in that grade between 1939 and 1941. In 1942 Kennefick played in his first senior county final with \\"the Barr's\\". Ballincollig, a team who had defeated nine-in-a-row hopefuls Glen Rovers in the semi-final, provided the opposition. St. Finbarr's made no mistake and powered to a 5-7 to 2-2. It was Kennefick's first championship medal. Both St. Finbarr's and Ballincollig met in the championship decider again the following year. A 3-3 apiece draw, thanks to a late goal by Seán Condon, was the result on that occasion, however, St. Finbarr's made no mistake in the replay and powered to a 7-9 to 1-1 victory. It was Kennefick's second and final championship medal. =Inter-county= Kennefick first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team in 1941. He won a Munster medal that year following a 4-6 to 3-3 defeat of Tipperary. Kennefick later lined out in the All-Ireland decider against Kilkenny. A 5-2 to 2-2 score line gave Cork the victory and gave Kennefick an All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship medal. In 1942 Kennefick made his senior championship debut in a Munster semi-final defeat of Limerick. He won his first Munster that year as Tipp were downed by 4-15 to 4-1 in the subsequent provincial decider. The All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year with Dublin providing the opposition once again. The game was a close affair with just a point separating the sides at the three-quarter stage. In the end Cork won comfortably enough by 2-14 to 3-4 and Kennefick collected his first All-Ireland medal. Kennefick was just eighteen- years-old when he was appointed captain of the Cork team in 1943. A 2-13 to 3-8 defeat of Waterford that year gave him a second Munster medal. He later lined out in a second All-Ireland decider with Antrim becoming the first Ulster side to qualify for a final. Unfortunately, the occasion got to the Glensmen as Cork built up an unassailable 3-11 to 0-2 half-time lead. The final score of 5-16 to 0-4 gave Cork their second-ever hat-trick of All- Ireland titles while it also gave Kennefick a third All-Ireland medal and the honour of collecting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. By this stage Kennefick had come to be regarded as something of a teenage prodigy, however, his story is one of a great \\"might-have-been\\". In the first-round of the 1944 Munster series of games Kennefick's wrist was broken by Tipperary player James Ryan. The injury proved detrimental to his career as Kennefick never played for Cork again. =Inter-provincial= Kennefick also had the honour of being selected for Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. He made his debut with the province in 1943 and collected his sole Railway Cup medal following a narrow 4-3 to 3-5 defeat of Leinster. Coaching career In retirement from playing Kennefick became involved in team management and coaching. In 1974 he was coach of the St. Finbarr's senior hurling team that qualified for the senior club championship decider. A 2-17 to 2-14 defeat of Blackrock gave \\"the Barr's\\" their first title in six years. Kennefick's side later secured the Munster title following a 0-7 to 0-3 victory over Newmarket-on-Fergus. The subsequent All-Ireland decider saw St. Finbarr's face Kilkenny and Leinster champions Fenians. A 3-8 to 1-6 victory gave St. Finbarr's their first All- Ireland title.

Born in Toomevara, County Tipperary, Hassett first played competitive hurling during his schooling at the Patrician College, Ballyfin. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty-seven when he first linked up with the Tipperary senior team. He made his senior debut in the 1960 championship. Hassett went on to play a brief role for Tipperary during a golden age for the team, and won one All- Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. An All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion, Hassett also captained the team to All- Ireland victory in 1961. At club level Hassett was a one-time championship medallist with Toomevara. Throughout his inter-county career, Hassett made just 8 championship appearances for Tipperary. His retirement came as a result of injury following the conclusion of the 1963 championship. In retirement from playing, Hassett became involved in team management and coaching. He served as a selector with the Tipperary minor and under-21 teams at various times. Biography Matt Hassett was born in Toomevara, Co. Tipperary in 1932. The son of Pat and Nora Hassett (née O'Meara), he was born into an area and into a family that had a very strong hurling tradition. He was a neighbour of Stephen Hackett, winner of All-Ireland honours with Tipperary in 1925. Hassett's father was a first cousin of the famed Patrick ‘Wedger’ Meagher, who captained the Tipperary hurling team in the All-Ireland final of 1913. His mother's uncle, Jim O'Dywer, won an All-Ireland medal with Tipp in the inaugural hurling championship in 1887. Hassett was educated at the local national school and later attended the Patrician College in Ballyfin, County Laois. Here he became a star on the college hurling team where he was noted as an excellent goal poacher when playing at full-forward. Hassett later studied law at university and was a long-time partner in the Nenagh firm of solicitors of James O'Brien & Co. His son Mark, now works in the same practice. Playing career =Club= Hassett played his club hurling with the famous Toomevara club. His first competitive games were as an under-15 player; however, he enjoyed little success. Hassett became secretary of the club in 1954; however, hurling was at a low ebb in the club. He began to organise the juvenile and minor teams and in 1956 Toomevara entered a team in the senior county championship. Four years later in 1960 this reorganization bore fruit as Hassett collected his sole senior county championship title.Captains of the Ash p. 80 Hassett also won three county football championship titles in 1958, 1959 and 1961. =Inter-county= Unlike many of his contemporaries Hassett did not come to prominence on the county minor team. Instead his inter-county career began by chance. In 1958 Hassett traveled as a spectator to Buttevant to see Cork take on Tipperary in a challenge game and ended up playing at corner-back. He played some other tournament games with Tipp, and in 1960 he was picked at right corner-back on Tipperary's championship fifteen.Captains of the Ash p. 82 In Hassett's first season on the team Tipp reached the provincial final and he was given the unenviable task of marking Cork's Christy Ring. In one of the toughest games of hurling ever-played Hassett succeeded in holding Ring to just three points; while Tipp went on to win the game by 4-13 to 4-11. It was his first Munster title. The subsequent All- Ireland final pitted Tipperary against Wexford. Tipperary displayed a certain amount of over-confidence going into the match and Wexford pounced at the beginning of each half with two goals by Mick Hassett and Oliver McGrath. The crowd invaded the pitch with a minute to go, mistaking the final whistle, and when the disorder was cleared Tipperary continued playing with twelve men. It mattered little as Wexford were the All-Ireland champions by 2-15 to 0-11. In 1961 Hassett was appointed captain of the team as Tipp set out to make amends for the All-Ireland final defeat. The year began well with Hassett leading his team to a National Hurling League title.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 73 He later lined out in a second Munster final. Once again it was Cork who provided the opposition, however, Tipp steamrolled their greatest rivals by 3-6 to 0-7.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 It was Hassett's second Munster title. Tipperary later lined out in the All-Ireland final for the second year in-a-row. Dublin were the opponents on that occasion, however, a certain amount of overconfidence had crept into the side once again. The game was nip and tuck for much of the hour and ‘the Dubs’ led by two points with thirteen minutes left. Jimmy Doyle was Tipp's hero as he scored nine points to give Tipp a 0-16 to 1-12 victory.The GAA Book of Lists p. 355 The victory gave Hassett an All-Ireland winners’ medal. In 1962 Hassett's inter-county career came to an abrupt halt when he broke and severely damaged his finger in a game against Limerick. The injury confined him to the subs bench, and effectively ended his career.

The 12C-36 made its debut in Tripoli Grand Prix 1936, and the 12C-37 in Coppa Acerbo 1937. The 12C-36 was a Tipo C fitted with the new V12 instead of the 3.8 litre straight- eight of the 8C-35. The 12C-37 was a new car, with a lower chassis and an engine bored and stroked to 4475 cc, now with roller- instead of plain bearings and two smaller superchargers instead of a single large one. The car suffered poor handling, which could not be cured in time for the 1937 Italian GP, and thus was not successful. This is given as the reason for Vittorio Jano's resignation from Alfa Romeo at the end of 1937. The 12C-36 used the existing six Tipo C chassis. Four examples of the 12C-37 were built, although only two were actually assembled for the 1937 Coppa Acerbo and Italian GP. Early in 1938, the Tipo C (8C-35, 12C-36) chassis were modified into 308s, with the straight-eight engine fitted lower in the chassis and a completely new body. The four 12C-37 chassis were instead assembled into 312 (V12 downsized to 3-litre) and 316 (V16 obtained from two 158 engines fitted to a common crankcase) formula race cars.

Viewing figures: 5.98m. Unlikely travel partners Esther (Alice Eve) and Gemma (Rachel Leskovac) are thrown together when their mutual friend, Carol (Koel Purie), has an accident on the eve of their trip. Adventurous loner Esther hopes to part company once in India, but needy Gemma is terrified of travelling alone. Gemma's money bag gets stolen and Carol returns it to her while on the train. She causes great friction between Gemma and Esther, and provokes several fights. Her husband Zac (Jason Flemyng) takes an instant liking to Gemma, and invites her for a cruise on his boat with him and his wife. Gemma requests that Esther be invited and reluctantly the couple agree. They spend the day on the boat sunbathing and relaxing. But Gemma is taken aback when Carol and Zac get naked and start having sex in the water. Esther begs to be taken back to the dock with Gemma, but is mocked and told it was her choice to come, that she is outnumbered as the other three want to stay and she will have to wait till they're all ready to leave. They end up on a deserted island where Carol and Zac have rented a house and are taken deep into the forest to find it. Esther, becoming increasingly uncomfortable, pulls Gemma aside and begs her to leave together as she doesn't trust them, to which Gemma tells her off for trusting no one. They find themselves at an exotic Indian house decorated with strange masks. The girls are shown to the rooms where they will be sleeping, and while Esther is alone, she discovers a photo which Gemma gave her earlier, seeing Zak in the photo staring at Gemma and realizes they have been following Gemma; that this entire thing has been a set-up. She rushes to Gemma's bedroom only to have Carol open the door and tell her to go downstairs and wait for her and Gemma, hearing a muffled noise of agreement from Gemma in the background. Esther walks downstairs to find Zac in the kitchen, stabbing a chopping board repeatedly while talking to her, making her extremely nervous. Finally Gemma comes downstairs, all dressed up in Indian finery. The four sit outside for dinner and drink wine (which Zac mentions has been drugged), making Esther very dizzy (as the viewer can tell from the blurry camera screen). Zac approaches Gemma, saying he has something very important to tell her, and she willingly accompanies him down some stairs to a beautifully Indian-decorated room. Esther eventually joins them, stumbling along. She listens while Zac tells Gemma about how he and Carol love her and want her to join their \\"family\\". Gemma happily accepts and hugs Carol when Zac tells her to. Esther becomes very agitated and pulls out the photo, showing it to Gemma while telling her how Zac and Carol targeted her, stalked her and stole her money bag so they could return it and become her friend. Zac invents lies to explain away these \\"coincidences\\", and Gemma turns on Esther, calling her jealous and otherwise insulting her. Esther slaps her and Gemma falls to the floor, hitting her head on a table. She appears to be unconscious. Carol rushes to her side while Esther runs for the door. Zac chases her but loses her in the thick brush. Esther collapses on the beach and later wakes up to police surrounding her. She is taken to prison after the police determine she killed Carol, whose body was found with multiple stab wounds. The first part ends with Esther whimpering in jail. =Part 2= * Aired: 19 December 2006. Viewing figures: 4.87m. The interrogator comes in and begins trying to make Esther confess. He throws down the photos of Carol while telling her how she was stabbed 6 times with a large serrated object. He is adamant she killed her. The scene switches to Gemma talking to Esther, telling her how she can't help her and that Esther is on her own. Then it's back to Esther waking up in her jail bed, making the viewer unsure if the previous scene was real. Her new lawyer enters, and as they start speaking, the scene cuts to Esther being allowed to make a phone call. She calls hers and Gemma's mutual friend, Carol, who explains that she is physically unable to come to India because her leg is fractured and in a plaster cast, and Esther tells her that she's in prison, but the phone goes dead at that moment. Esther tries to dial the number again but the officer grabs it out of her hand and she is dragged from the room. The next scene is of Gemma in a room with Zac, who is instructing her to do something but he won't specify what. He hands her a pair of scissors and leaves for work. The scene cuts back to Esther being yelled at by the prison interrogator, who is interrupted by her lawyer. She has been granted bail and leaves the prison after being handed a card which has on it the name of the person who posted her bond. She is met by Steve who was sent by Carol. He takes her to a hotel and they discuss ways of finding Gemma. The next day they go to the house of the person who posted Esther's bail, who turns out to be Coral's mother. She tells Esther that Coral was taken by a man who sent obscene pictures, and demanded money every week. Coral's mother paid the money faithfully until he asked for too much. One week later Coral turned up dead. Steve and Esther run into the city to look for signs of Gemma and eventually find online the photo Gemma originally gave Esther. Esther rings her lawyer and tries to send the photo to him but his server is down and won't receive it. Instead she returns to the hotel and faxes the photo to her lawyer. The camera cuts back to Gemma, who has been told by Zac that she knows what needs to be done, and that he loves her, and again hands her the scissors. He kisses her goodbye and tells her he will allow her to go shopping if she does what he wants her to do. She promises to do it, and he leaves for work. Esther falls apart in Steve's arms and they end up kissing and sleeping together. The next morning Steve receives a text from the lawyer and leaves while Esther is in the bathroom. When she catches up with Steve, he tells her that their night together was a mistake, because he loves Gemma. She goes off at Steve about what Gemma is really like and he walks away. Later they meet back up and together go to the address of the house where she and Gemma were taken. Intermittently, flashes of Gemma crying and cutting off her hair are shown. Esther jumps out of the taxi and chases who she thinks is Gemma but once she sees the dark, short hair, she thinks she has failed. The person turns around and it is Gemma. She is terrified and refuses to go to the police, and runs away into the crowd while Steve and Esther are fighting. They find her back at Zac's house, and he returns while Gemma slowly packs to leave. There is a struggle and Steve kills Zac by pushing him off a ledge. Gemma and Steve invent a story about how it was self-defense and then go to the police. Gemma signs the statement she's made against Zac. Esther is released and they all meet Gemma's parents at a hotel. Esther's jailer meets her at the hotel and harasses her into telling him what really happened with Zac. The viewers find out Gemma rang Zac from a phone booth after running away from Esther and Steve, and that she's been lying the whole time about it. She refuses to tell Steve until they get back home. Gemma admits to Esther she killed Coral, after Esther guesses the truth. Gemma says it's all Esther's fault and Esther responds by calling Gemma evil after being manipulated by her. Esther knows the police won't believe her if she tells them it was Gemma all along, especially since Gemma swears she will act dumb and dizzy if they arrest her, so Esther takes her bags and leaves.

Pisoni played mainly as a center fielder for four teams between 1953 and 1960. Listed at , , he batted and threw right-handed, and was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Pisoni will forever be known among baseball fans and historians as the last player to debut in a St. Louis Browns uniform. He was signed by the Browns before the 1949 season, but he spent two years in the military during the Korean War before joining St. Louis on September 25, 1953, becoming the last rookie to debut with the Browns before they moved to Baltimore and became the Orioles. He appeared in all three remaining games, including playing in the Browns closer on September 29. However, Pisoni never played for Baltimore. He went back to the minor leagues and three years later the Orioles traded him to the Kansas City Athletics. He played for them from 1956 to 1957, before joining the Milwaukee Braves (1959) and New York Yankees (1959–60). In a five- season career, Pisoni hit .212 (40-for-189) with six home runs and 20 RBI in 103 games, including 26 runs, three doubles and three triples. Following his baseball retirement, he worked as an electrical contractor. Pisoni died in Dallas, Texas, at the age of 77.

A Democrat, he is the current New York City Councilmember representing Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. A former musician, he was a founding member of the New York City hardcore bands Indecision and Most Precious Blood. Personal life Brannan is an outspoken vegetarian and animal welfare advocate. A Third Degree Master Freemason, Brannan founded the Bay Ridge Democrats, an active Democratic political club based in southwest Brooklyn. In 2012 he was named one of the \\"New York City Rising Stars: 40 Under 40\\" by City & State newspaper for his work as Director of Communications and Legislative Affairs for New York City Councilman Vincent Gentile. Brannan is married to artist and educator Leigh Jewel Holliday. The couple were married in the lobby of Bear Stearns where they met as employees. Brannan and Holliday opened a fine art school for children in Bay Ridge called The Art Room. Brannan attended Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He studied journalism and mass media at Fordham University and College of Staten Island. He has worked for Bank of New York and Bankers Trust. He later worked as a commercial announcer for WNEW-FM, where he was the de facto shop steward for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. While at WNEW, Brannan represented and defended the interests of his fellow employees and advocated to get all union employees retroactively paid for decades of overtime work on weekends and overnights. Career =Music career= Before entering politics, Justin Brannan was a hardcore punk guitarist for the bands Indecision from 1993 to 2000 and Most Precious Blood from 2000 onwards. Both bands were known for their outspoken commitment to social justice and vegetarianism. Though the sound was raw, their messages focused on social justice, human rights, environmentalism, relationships, individuality and espousing straight-edge views against drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex. Indecision is widely known for their song \\"Hallowed be Thy Name\\". The song features a lyric (\\"For Those I Love I Will Sacrifice\\") wrote by Brannan when he was sixteen years old that fans across the world have turned into a tattoo. Most famously, an image of the tattoo was seen on the ribs of a 19-year-old US Army infantryman named Kyle Hockenberry being treated in a medevac helicopter following an explosion that cost him both of his legs and one arm. The photo was taken for a military newspaper and won photographer Laura Rauch an award from the Society of Professional Journalists. Brannan also works closely with the 9/11 Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation commemorating the heroes of 9/11 and \\"Building for America’s Bravest\\", a program that constructs Smart Homes for military returning home with devastating injuries. Brannan also founded the deathgrind band Caninus, known for using two dogs as vocalists. =Finance career= Brannan was a touring punk rock musician before he landed at Bear Stearns, working his way up as a clerk in their wealth management division, and working as a financier in the venture capital space raising money for start-up alternative energy companies based in Silicon Valley. He later worked as a fundraising consultant for a number of non-profit humanitarian organizations in New York City. Political career Brannan served as the Director of Communications and Legislative Affairs for Council member Vincent J. Gentile, representing the 43rd District which includes Bay Ridge, Bath Beach, Dyker Heights and portions of Bensonhurst. =City Council= In 2017, Brannan won the Democratic primary to replace Gentile in the 43rd district. Brannan won 39% of the vote in a five-way race, narrowly beating Khader El- Yateem, who garnered 31% of the vote, by 682 votes. Brannan drew criticism during the campaign for taking money from real estate interests. Contributors to Brannan's campaign include Sal Raziano of the real estate firm Casandra Properties, James Vavas of Vavas Insurance and Financial Services, and Anthony Constantinople of Constantinople & Vallone, a lobbying firm currently under investigation for conflicts of interest and payroll discrepancies surrounding its Sports & Arts program at a Lower East Side public school. During the campaign, several concerned citizens filed a complaint with the New York City Campaign Finance Board in which they accused Brannan of neglecting to disclose campaign expenses when he failed to alert election regulators that Gentile’s campaign for Brooklyn DA paid the rent for Brannan’s campaign office. In the general election, Brannan won with 51% of the vote to the Republican candidate, John Quaglione's 47%.

Old Bradford Cannery in Nushagak, 1917 Canneries in Nushagak, 1917 In 1881, after the Alaska Purchase by the United States, the United States Signal Corps built a weather station at Nushagak. The first salmon cannery in the Bristol Bay region was constructed by Arctic Packing Company in 1883 at Kanulik, just east of Nushagak Point. Several other canneries followed, two of which were at Nushagak Point. Gillnets on drying racks in Nushagak, 1917 The Pacific Steam Whaling Company built a cannery there in 1899 with Crescent Porter Hale as its first superintendent. It was bought by Pacific Packing and Navigation Co in 1901 and after its demise, Northwestern Fisheries Co. in 1904. Pacific American Fisheries bought the property in 1933 along with others in the region but never operated the Nushagak cannery. It was leased to Lowes Trading Company in 1936 and closed after the 1937 season following death of Lowes' manager, Alex Bradford, and reports of financial difficulties. The second cannery built in 1899 was owned by the Alaska Fisherman's Packing Co. It was bought by Libby, McNeill and Libby in 1916 and operated until 1936. Gillnet boats and fishermen on the beach in Nushagak, 1917 Despite the commanding position that the Point offered over the entire upper Nushagak Bay, it suffered from extensive and growing mud flats that limited access to vessels except during the bay's extreme high tides. Nushagak Point remains the location of some productive salmon set net sites. Artifacts from the cannery era, such as donkey engines, still remain. The world wide influenza pandemic of 1918 devastated the region in 1919, and contributed to the depopulation of Nushagak. After the epidemic a hospital and orphanage were established in Kanakanak, across the river and 6 miles (10 km) from the present-day city center of Dillingham.

A member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the subfamily Dolichoderinae, it was described by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858. The meat ant is associated with many common names due to its appearance, nest-building behaviour and abundance, of which its specific name, purpureus, refers to its coloured appearance. It is among the best-known species of ant found throughout Australia; it occurs in almost all states and territories except for Tasmania. Its enormous distribution, aggression and ecological importance have made this ant a dominant species. The meat ant is monomorphic (occurs in a particular form), although there is evidence that certain populations can be polymorphic. It is characterised by its dark-bluish body and red head. It is a medium to large species, measuring . The workers and males are approximately the same sizes at and , respectively. The queens are the largest and appear mostly black, measuring . The iridescence in workers ranges from green or blue to plain green and purple, varying in different body parts and castes. Meat ants inhabit open and warm areas in large, oval-shaped mounds that are accompanied by many entrance holes. The nest area is always cleared of vegetation and covered with materials including gravel, pebbles and dead vegetation. They are also polydomous, where a colony may be established in a series of satellite nests connected by well-defined paths and trails. Satellite nests are constructed away from the main nest and nearby areas with valuable food sources so workers can exploit them. Queens mate with a single male and colonies may have more than one queen until the workers arrive, where they both exhibit antagonism. It takes around one or two months for an individual egg to develop into an adult. Colonies range in size, varying between 11,000 individuals to over 300,000. The meat ant is a diurnal species (active throughout most of the day), especially when it is warm. It forages on trees and collects sweet substances such as honeydew and nectar, and also captures insects or collects the remains of animals. A number of predators eat these ants, including the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), numerous species of birds, blind snakes and spiders. This species is also a competitor of the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Meat ants establish territorial borders with neighbouring colonies and solve disputes through ritualised fighting. Meat ants play an important role in both the environment and for humans. A single nest is capable of dispersing over 300,000 plant seeds; moreover, meat ants have formed symbiotic relationships with many insects. This ant may be used as a form of pest control to kill the cane toad, an invasive species. They can also help farmers to remove animal carcasses by consuming and reducing them to bones in a matter of weeks. Despite this, meat ants are sometimes pests around urban areas and eradicating them is difficult. Taxonomy W.W. Froggatt, 1907. The meat ant was first described in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of Hymenopterous Insects in the Collection of the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Formica purpurea from a holotype worker ant he collected in Melbourne, Victoria. The type material is currently housed in the Natural History Museum, London. In 1862, Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr erected the genus Iridomyrmex, and reclassified the meat ant as a member of Iridomyrmex rather than the genus Formica. The ant was named Iridomyrmex purpurea in 1862. Mayr renamed the ant as Iridomyrmex purpureus one year after. I. purpureus was later classified as a synonym of Iridomyrmex detectus, and this taxon was designated as the type species of Iridomyrmex in 1903. In 1993, I. detectus was synonymised with I. purpureus and grouped into the I. purpureus species complex. I. detectus was described as a separate species by Smith the same year as I. purpureus from two syntype queens he collected from the Hunter River in New South Wales. Although the name I. purpureus was used by many authors, Karl Wilhelm von Dalla Torre reused I. detectus and this was adopted by several authors, replacing I. purpureus. By the 1960s I. purpureus once again became preferred over I. detectus. While the two names were described in the same year and publication, the name I. purpureus is the valid name for the species in accordance with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Entomologist B.T. Lowne was the first person to revise I. purpureus and I. detectus, and he synonymised the two species. Several synonyms have either been classified as a separate species from the meat ant or even a subspecies. Iridomyrmex purpureus sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus were classified as subspecies in 1974, previously being recognised as two species. I. detectus castrae was originally described as a variant of the meat ant in 1925 (as I. d. var. castrae), but the taxon was reclassified as a subspecies in 1985; subsequently, a 1993 revision reclassified I. p. sanguineus and I. p. viridiaeneus at species level while I. d. castrae was synonymised, based on morphological examinations of collected material. Camponotus horni, Formica smithii and Liometopum aeneum were described as three distinct species in three different ant genera, but these classifications were short-lived, as scientists discovered that these taxa were all identical, and subsequently synonymised them with the meat ant. Camponotus horni was described by English entomologist William Forsell Kirby in 1896 from worker and queen syntypes he collected at Palm Creek in the Northern Territory. In 1930, Australian entomologist John S. Clark reviewed these specimens and synonymised the taxon with the meat ant. However, the queen was later found to be distinct from the workers and C. horni was redescribed as a species. The information provided by Clark makes it sufficient to retain the validity of the name, making Clark the new author of C. horni. Due to the uncertain taxonomic status of Clark's C. horni, a proposal to rename the species cannot be carried through. Clark's C. horni is currently a junior homonym for Kirby's C. horni. Syntype specimen of Iridomyrmex detectus castrae, currently housed in the Natural History Museum of Geneva. One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was described as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele. These examinations did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light as to whether or not these ants are genetically different from the meat ant. Under the present classification, the meat ant is a member of the genus Iridomyrmex in the tribe Leptomyrmecini, subfamily Dolichoderinae. It is a member of the family Formicidae, belonging to the order Hymenoptera, an order of insects containing ants, bees, and wasps. The genus Froggattella is the sister group of Iridomyrmex, both of which are in a clade that is 23 million years old. Fossils related to the meat ant and other species are from the Eocene and Oligocene. =Forms= In the early 1970s, scientists discovered several different forms of meats ants, forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group; three forms were identified (the regular I. purpureus and the other two forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus), differing in colour and nest structure. However, as there were no clear morphological differences among these variations, the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain. Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen, to those with a yellowish body and a bluish-purple gaster. Others may be darker, appearing metallic-bluish to purplish-black. Owing to their different geographical ranges, the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated, based on examinations where multiple forms were sympatric. Each form had its own geographical limit, although the regular I. purpureus form is very common, inhabiting at least one-third of the Australian continent. Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats; for example, one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas, and others in cool and dry areas. In 1974, I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus were classified as two subspecies of the meat ant by P.J. Greenslade. He also recognised another form, an undescribed blue form that was first studied several years earlier. Greenslade did not propose any taxonomic recognition of the newly discovered taxon, but instead referred to it as a \\"form\\". In 1975, a study examined the distinctiveness of three forms by comparing the amylase enzyme allele frequencies. The blue form was found to be genetically isolated and its allele frequencies differed significantly from the forms purpureus and viridiaeneus, but the same study concluded that these latter two forms were similar. During this time, Greenslade would continue to study these forms to include a dark yellow, yellow, orange and a small purple form. In addition, two new forms were recognised in later studies, but these two forms were not given any formal species description. Instead, they were only recognised by their colour and the genitalia of the males. Although these forms most likely represented undescribed, yet distinct species, the I. purpureus species group only contained a single valid species, three subspecies and seven different forms. In 1993, all known forms and subspecies were either revived or classified at species level in an article revising the group, concluding the separation of the forms from each other. =Etymology and common names= The specific epithet of the meat ant, purpureus, derives from Latin, in which it means \\"purple\\", \\"purple-coloured\\" or \\"dark-red\\", referencing the coloured appearance of the ant. In classical Latin, purpureus primarily translated to \\"dyed purple\\", while the word purpura, used by Smith for the meat ant (Formica purpura), translates to \\"purpled-dyed cloth\\". The generic name, Iridomyrmex, translates to \\"rainbow ants\\" from Ancient Greek, another reference which points to its appearance. This, in particular, is due to its blue-green iridescence colour. It is a compound of two Ancient Greek words – iris, meaning \\"rainbow\\", and myrmex, that means \\"ant\\". The ant is commonly known as the meat ant because of its habit of stripping the meat off dead vertebrates. Alternative names include the gravel ant, Greenslade's meat ant, meat-eater ant, mound ant, or southern meat ant. The name \\"southern meat ant\\" is due to its extreme abundance in the southern regions of Australia. Description A worker specimen of I. purpureus. In general, meat ants are medium to large in size, measuring , and can be easily recognised by their dark-bluish body and red head. Generally, their heads and pronotums share similar colours and are lighter than the mesothorax (the middle of the three segments in the thorax) and the propodeum (the first abdominal segment), which are reddish brown. However, the head may sometimes be lighter, and the pronotum and mesothorax may share similar colours. The mesosomal setae (as in hair found on the mesosoma) are dark and sometimes translucent. The iridescence between the compound eyes and the lateral portion of the head ranges from slightly purple to strong and dark purple. The colour of the legs and coxae (the basal segment of the insect leg, which attaches to the body) are darker than the mesothorax, and the petiole (narrow waist) is reddish brown and also darker than the mesothorax. The lateral portion of the second gastral tergite (a dorsal segment other than the head) is shiny, and the iridescence varies among workers, from green or blue to plain green and purple. The soft hairs on the head are frequent around the occipital margin, and around the mandibular insertion, three to eight pale setae are usually seen. The soft hairs are also common around the first gastral tergite. Examined specimens show no known ocelli. Erect setae on the pronotum are abundant. The anterodorsal (meaning in front and toward the back) portion of the propodeum is arched and flat. There are no allometric differences among workers. On average, workers measure around ; this character distinguishes these ants from queens, as well as the different variety of colours they exhibit on their bodies. The head and pronotum range from orange to brick-red, and the mesonotum and propodeum are either light, same in colour or darker than the head. The gaster can be brown or black with blue or purple iridescence and the legs are either orange or brown. The iridescence around the foreparts is blue, pink, pale greenish yellow and purple. The erect setae are brown. The head has a concave posterior margin (as in the end of an organism from its head) with erect setae abundant in front of the face. The sides of the head are convex. Fully erect setae on the genal (side region of the head) are either present or absent, although a small number of setae may be seen around the mandibular insertion. The eyes are semicircular and positioned around the midpoint of the ants' head capsule. The frontal carinae (a keel-shaped ridge or structure) are convex and the antennal scapes extend beyond the head's posterior margin by two or three times the diameter. Erect setae are found all over the antennal scape and noticeably prominent on the clypeal margin (a shield-like plate at the front of an insect). The mandibles are elongated and triangular, with long curved setae around the head capsule. The pronotum is evenly curved with at least 12 or more pronotal setae present. These setae are mostly short and bristly. The mesonotum is sinuous (meaning it has many curves), and, like the pronotum, has 12 or more mesonotal setae. The mesothoracic spiracles are very small and the propodeal dorsum is smooth or convex. There are also a number of propodeal setae. The dorsum of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is thin, scale-like and sometimes vertical. There are both non-marginal and marginal setae present on the first gastral tergite around the gaster. A specimen image of a male. Queens are easily distinguishable from workers by their black colour and larger size, measuring . Queens are black, being mostly dark. The antennae and legs are ferruginous (rust-like colour), the head is fusco-ferruginous, and the sides beneath the face and mandibles are ferruginous. The head is wider than the thorax and emarginate. There is an impressed line that runs from the anterior (nearer to the front of the body) stemma to the base of the clypeus. The thorax is ovate (has an oval-shaped outline) and thinly covered with short reddish brown pubescence (soft short hair). The wings are subhyaline, exhibiting a glassy appearance. The wings are yellowish along the anterior margin of the superior pair and also around the base; the nervures (the veins of the wings) are rufo-fuscous. Like the thorax, the abdomen is ovate and several abdominal segments appear rufo-piceous, making it reddish-brown or glossy brownish black. Males are smaller than queens, measuring . Males are bright violet, and the antennae (except for the first joint) and tarsi are ferruginous. The first pair of the legs look almost ferruginous, and the head, legs and thorax are covered with black pubescence. Like the queen, the wings are subhyaline (imperfectly hyaline) and the nervures are rufo-fuscous. The abdomen shows a bright green tinge when seen under certain light. A microscopic view of a meat ant's eye. Larvae measure . The body is stout-shaped and the dorsal side is longer whereas the ventral side (the bottom portion of the body) is shorter and more straight. The head and anus are ventral. The integument is covered in spinules that are either isolated from each other or in short rows on the posterior somite and on the ventral surface. The body hairs are very short, measuring . The cranium on its dorsal side outlines a curve which is smooth, and the spinules are moderately large. These spinules are either isolated or seen in near parallel rows. Several head hairs are present but they are small at in length. The labrum is narrow and bilobed (consisting of two lobes). Each lobe has spinules and three sensilla (simple sensory receptors) around the anterior surface. The ventral border only has two sensilla and a number of spinules, and on the posterior surface, there are several rows of spinules and three sensilla. The mandibles have a central apical (most distal plate or appendage from the body) tooth which is clearly noticeable and sharp. The maxillae have lobes, and the labial palps (sensory structures on the labium) are knob-shaped. Meat ant workers may be confused with those of I. lividus, as the two appear similar and are grouped in the same species complex. I. lividus and the much more localised I. spadius can be distinguished from other members of the I. purpureus group by the shape of the pronotum. Aside from colour differentiation that was a key morphological character to distinguish I. purpureus and the synonym I. greensladei from each other, some meat ant populations exhibit polymorphism despite being monomorphic (occurs in a particular form); specifically, body size among meat ants may vary geographically. For example, those that are found in very hot regions tend to be larger, whereas those found in regions of high humidity tend to be smaller than average. Examined workers once referred to as I. greensladei from southwestern Western Australia have erect setae on the genae (lateral sclerites), whereas those studied elsewhere have glabrous genae, meaning that these areas have no hairs. Such patterns are most likely clinal, where several characteristics may gradually differentiate over a geographical area. The colour of the setae throughout the body and the iridescence may vary geographically. For example, populations restricted to the coasts of Western Australia usually have pale setae, compared to most colonies throughout the country, which have the common blackish setae. In 1993, Shattuck could not separate populations with pale setae when other key diagnostic traits that would separate these populations were not considered. Meat ants from the Western Australian wheatbelt and goldfields show different iridescence; the iridescence in some collected specimens ranged from pale greenish-blue to yellowish-green, especially around the humeri (a structure which forms the basal corner of an insect's wing or wing case) and frons. The variation of the iridescence is, however, a consistent pattern found in other Iridomyrmex species with little distinction, making it a subtle character. The colour variation is less marked in all collected specimens of I. purpureus, as well as its close relative I. viridiaeneus, which is found in dry regions around the south-western regions. Shattuck further notes that populations found throughout the Northern Territory and South Australia have reduced pubescence on the first gastral tergite, but this is different elsewhere. Distribution and habitat Reported occurrences of meat ant populations according to the Atlas of Living Australia The meat ant is one of the best- known species of ant endemic to Australia; it has an enormous geographical range, covering at least one-third of the continent. Its range spans from east to west, and from north to south. This extensive range has allowed the meat ant to form large nesting grounds in areas where no development has occurred, and large amounts of gravel and open space have led to an abundant supply of materials (i.e. pebbles and dead pieces of vegetation) used to construct nests. Its isolation has also allowed meat ants to form associations with neighbouring nests of the same species. The ant is particularly dominant and frequently seen across the coastal and inland regions of southeastern Australia. Based on examined material, meat ants are widespread throughout New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In Queensland, they are frequently encountered in the eastern regions, whereas their abundance is limited around the north and central parts. The ants are common in the southwestern regions of Western Australia, though not in the north. However, the Division of Entomology of the CSIRO states that the ant's presence in the state has not been verified. Most specimens collected in South Australia are from the south-east, but some populations are known in the north-west and northeast regions of the state. In the Northern Territory, specimens have been collected in the north and south regions but compared to other jurisdictions the ant is uncommon. No specimens have been collected from Tasmania or any outlying islands surrounding Australia. Meat ants thrive in varied habitats, especially where it is open and warm. These ants are adapted to and thrive in warm climates and areas with constant high temperatures. The meat ant shares its distribution with many other animals and insects, some of which may cause harm to the ant or rival it, such as the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Nests are seen in box-pine scrubs, Callitris forests, dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, eucalypt open woodland, in farm pastures, flat savannah woodland, mallee woodland, heath, mulga, riparian woodland, around roads and cracks in sidewalks, and urban areas such as urban gardens and parkland. Nests are also common in lateritic ridges, granite outcrops and clay formations. Meat ants are able to survive in dry areas if there is a rich supply of water and food resources (such as honeydew and arthropod prey), especially along river banks, station properties and irrigated areas. Meat ants typically occur at altitudes of above sea level, though at times they can be found at heights of . Those that are found at these altitudes are always associated with Eucalyptus rubida, and colonies situated in eastern New South Wales tend to nest near E. melliodora and E. blakelyi. In the south coast of New South Wales, meat ants are mainly found in heath shrubland, but are absent from heavily timbered slopes and cannot build nests in quartz. Other areas where the ants do not occur include dense pastures, dense bushes, tropical rainforests and treeless areas. For example, the Canberra suburb of Turner was constructed on subterranean clover pasture, which meat ants do not nest around. Their populations would later flourish and nests became numerous around houses after shrubs and trees were planted. =Nests= Meat ant mound near Bungendore, New South Wales Meat ants are well known for their large, oval-shaped nest-mounds (normally in diameter) that are encountered in areas of occurrence, and obvious to identify. These nests are often associated with many entrance holes; most nests have 20 to 35 holes. On the surface on the nest, workers clear the area of vegetation and cover the mound with gravel, but may use other materials that are available, including sand, pebbles, dead vegetation, eucalyptus fruits and twig fragments. Nests are built in the sun and hardly in the shade to keep them warm. The ant is a polydomous species, meaning that they live in more than one nest. Some colonies are known to create \\"super-nests\\": workers construct many nests connected through established paths, extending up to in length. In one extreme case, a single colony was found to occupy over of land with 85 individual nests and 1,500 entrance holes. While they show no aggression toward their own nest mates, meat ants are aggressive to occupants of different nests within the same colony. Polydomy within a colony is typically favoured as it improves access to forage, as workers deliver most of their food to the nest that is closest to any site they forage in. At any size, a meat ant nest always has a possibility of dying out in any year, but the site may be reoccupied by another colony. Hence, nests can be very old as suggested in one study. Some nests may never be reoccupied for unknown reasons. The regrowth of vegetation which shades the nest, soil damage or even a disease may wipe out a colony and leave the nest site completely abandoned. The death of a colony may be obvious when competing colonies increase in population and size by expanding their territories with well-established satellite nests in order exploit the food sources once used by a former colony. Satellite nests may diverge from their parent nests to become independent, as suggested by the antagonism of worker ants from different nests or when others are uninhabitable by insecticide treatment. After the eradication of a nest, satellite nests emerge nearby, and may sever their connections with the parent nest. The separation of a satellite nest is an effective way for a nest to exploit food sources, and a colony with less than 11 entrance holes is recognised as non-mature (a nest is mature at 12). As most satellite nests have 11 holes and accept a queen of their own, a satellite nest may easily develop maturity in one year. Ant mound holes prevent water from entering the nest during rain All entrance holes of a given nest lead into a separate set of galleries. Entrance holes tend to be very small with only enough space for a single worker to fit through, but others may be wide. Beneath the surface, there are widened circular vertical shafts which are wide. Below these shafts, the tunnels turn into irregular galleries with paths going outward and downward which form more galleries. Almost all of these galleries are clustered together beneath the soil, which is extensively reworked by worker ants in the area above the nest. These sets of galleries are isolated from others connecting to neighbouring holes, although some may come close. However, there is no known physical connection. Each gallery has a flat floor, a domed roof and is irregularly oval-shaped. A gallery is typically high and wide. Below the galleries are a small number of shafts in undisturbed soil with large, yet scattered chambers where the population remains during the winter. In the upper areas of the colony, the galleries and shafts only account for 7–10% of nest space. For example, the galleries of excavated colonies occupy whereas the total volume is around . Overall, a nest may dwell extremely deep beneath the soil as excavated nests are as deep as . Behaviour and ecology =Foraging and dominance= Worker foraging on vegetation A diurnal species (active mainly during the day), the meat ant shows minimal interaction with nocturnal ant species when their territories overlap. The meat ant and other members of the I. purpureus species group are regarded as a dominant group of diurnal species in Australia, as they are highly active, aggressive, and have an enormous geographical range. During the day, the bulk of the workers attend and feed on honeydew secreted by insects that live on the leaves of Eucalyptus trees. These trees are connected by foraging trails formed by meat ants, which also connect to satellite nests that are a part of a single colony; these trails are easily visible due to the absence of vegetation and lead to important food and water sources. Other workers in smaller numbers will often scavenge around the nest area for dead insects, or other proteinaceous foods to bring back to their colony. Their dominance is clear when meat ants are capable of finding food sources more successfully than most ants, capable of displacing many ants and other insects. Food sources are also discovered more rapidly and greatly reduces the foraging efficiency of other ants, including those of Iridomyrmex. However, some ants such as the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) are not affected by the presence of meat ants and are still successful in finding food sources. As green-head ants are general predators and forage singularly and cannot recruit other nestmates, they are unable to defend food sources from dominant ants. They heavily rely on any food source and the impossibility of successfully defending it from other ants may have led to its peaceful coexistence with dominant species, including meat ants. This means green-head ants avoid conflict with meat ants. Certain myrmicines, which are highly competitive, are capable of defending themselves from foraging workers; the rapid recruitment of nestmates and the use of chemicals for defence allows them to withstand attacks from meat ants. In particular, Monomorium ants have been observed occupying baits regardless of the presence or absence of the meat ant. This is not the case with mealworms, but they have moderate success with honey baits. In foraging areas where meat ants are excluded or not present, the number of other ants observed is far greater and activity dramatically increases. However, the presence of meats ants does not affect abundant species, and most of the time it is only Iridomyrmex ants that increase their foraging rate. Foraging trail with a satellite nest vaguely seen (top left) The impact of meat ants on other species varies, depending on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill those trying to compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats. The rate of movement of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14 °C (57 °F), but they are capable of withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43 °C (109 °F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8 °C (114 °F). At 50 °C (122 °F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50 °C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima. The success of meat ants depends on what resource they are dealing with. In one study, the removal of meat ants allowed the successful foraging of Iridomyrmex ants at carbohydrate sources, but not for protein baits. The success of the ants also did not increase with mealworm baits, suggesting that competition does not always occur between meat ants and other species, and factors, such as food preference, may be involved. In contrast with camponotines and some myrmicines, both of their success was affected at numerous food sources with meat ants present. Camponotines exhibit no aggression and cannot defend themselves. =Diet= Worker feeding on honey Like other Iridomyrmex species, the meat ant is an omnivore, retrieving food sources from various insects it tends, including caterpillars and various sorts of butterflies, particularly the larvae of the Waterhouse's hairstreak (Jalmenus lithochroa). Meat ants usually feed on honeydew from sap-sucking insects, flower nectar, sugar and other sweet substances. In captive colonies, workers prefer to consume small pieces of grapes rather than honey solutions and other sweet foods. These ants prey on various insects and animals, collecting both live and dead invertebrates and acquire meat from dead vertebrates. Insects the meat ants prey on include giant lacewings, which they swarm up trees to kill, the butterfly genoveva azure Ogyris genoveva, Indian mealmoths, almond moths, the Western Australian jarrah leafminer and the larvae of the wasp Trichogramma. Large and developed larvae of the cabbage butterfly (Pieris rapae) are attacked more effectively by meat ant workers than those of other Iridomyrmex species. On sandy beaches, this species is observed preying on the polychaete annelid worm, Armandia intermedia, causing high mortality rates on them (rates of 30 percent). These ants will feed on a number of dead or alive animals, including metamorphic crucifix toads, snakes, lizards, and birds. On some occasions, swarms of workers have been found on dead foxes. The meat ant is the only known ant in Australia that feeds on fresh guano. The collection of guano by a nearby meat ant colony shows the opportunistic nature of the species. Observations show that trails of workers in groups of two to four were found collecting the guano under an active bat roost within an abandoned mine and proceeded to return it to the nest. The collection of guano by any Australian ant colony was never recorded prior to these observations, but it is unknown why meat ants collect fresh guano. Meat ants cooperating to devour a cicada Meat ants are among the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by the toxins of the cane toad, an invasive species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate. Water is an important resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes it may not be available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% from the soil. Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water from the soil, whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away. =Predators= Despite their dominance among ants, a number of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down into the hole they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves on the head and chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it much easier for echidnas to prey on the winged females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas. Nest damage from a feeding echidna Several birds prey on meat ants. The masked woodswallow (A. personatus) and the white-browed woodswallow (Artamus superciliosus) will gather around meat ant nests and swoop at them, catching several ants before eating them. Pieces of meat ants have been found in the faeces of the red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii), rufous whistler (Pachycephala rufiventris), hooded robin (Melanodryas cucullata) and the red- browed treecreeper (Climacteris erythrops). Meat ants that forage on Ventilago viminalis trees are often eaten by the apostlebird. Some large ground-feeding birds, such as currawongs, magpies and ravens dig out newly established colonies after a queen has found a suitable spot to nest. Small domes of excavated soil are present at such spots, revealing the queens' presence to these birds. As a result, many queens are consumed by birds, leaving many abandoned nest chambers. The blind snake Ramphotyphlops nigrescens follow trails laid by meat ants to locate them, and the snakes are also known to feed on the brood. Various species of spiders prefer to prey on meat ants, mainly attracted by the alarm pheromone the ants release. One spider, in particular, the cursorial spider Habronestes bradleyi, is a specialist predator against these ants and uses their alarm pheromones that are released during territorial disputes to locate them. These alarm signals are created by oscillating the body along the longitudinal axis, which are mostly released when an ant encounters a nest mate. Cyclotorna monocentra moths feed on meat ant broods. The larvae of these moths are parasites to leafhoppers and will move to meat ant colonies to complete their development, where they will proceed to consume the brood; the females lay many eggs near ant trails which are close to the leafhoppers tended by ants. Other observations show that the Iphierga macarista larvae are scavengers in meat ant nests, while Sphallomorpha beetles live in burrows near nests of meat ants, where the larvae capture and prey on workers passing by. The larvae of the spitfire sawfly and Pseudoperga guerini are able to regurgitate a fluid against the meat ant if they are getting attacked by them; depending on how much is regurgitated, an ant will either walk away and clean itself or become fatally affected by it. Lizards such as the thorny dragon, which is a sit and wait predator, consume meat ants, but other lizards which eat Iridomyrmex ants usually reject this species. =Life cycle and reproduction= Meat ant alates swarming for nuptial flight Nuptial flight usually occurs during spring, in October. Reproductive females only mate with a single male and begin establishing their own colonies afterwards. Nuptial flight occurs after rain, where the males emerge from their nest first, followed by the virgin queens; groups of 20 to 40 females emerge after the males have flown away. The alates (the reproductive males and females) position themselves on top of the nest in order to heat themselves, and all fly at the same time once they are warm. This process may happen multiple times unless the weather had changed, otherwise, the queens would return to their nest. Nuptial flight may continue for days until all virgin queens have withdrawn from the nest. Most of the time, a single queen will start her own colony and lay eggs that will take around 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults, but colonies can also be founded through multiple queens cooperating with each other, adoption into an existing colony, or \\"budding\\" (also called \\"satelliting\\" or \\"fractionating\\"), where a subset of the colony including queens, workers and brood (eggs, larvae and pupae) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site. Around 10% of queens will have at least another queen with them during colony foundation. Many queens are killed during colony founding; major aspects include predation by birds and other ants, even those of the same species, due to the fact they attempt to establish their nests near large colonies. However, some queens are successful, sometimes with the assistance of neighbouring workers, who help the queen dig some chambers. Other causes of queen deaths include disease and starvation. A queen's ovaries may take four weeks to mature, and she lays around 20 eggs that may develop into larvae in less than a month. Workers have been observed laying eggs, presumably trophic eggs. The function of these unfertilised eggs are nutritional, not reproduction. The number of individuals in a colony varies. A mature nest of several years old can hold between 11,000 and 64,000 ants, while other colonies can house around 300,000. In some cases, enormous colonies can have as many as a million ants. Observed colonies are known to contain nearly 70,000 larvae and 64,000 workers; some can have 20,000 males and over 1,000 virgin queens, but others may have more virgin queens than males. The ratio of worker ants to the number of the larvae in colonies ranges from one worker for every two larvae or two larvae for every worker. The population of a nest can be affected or altered by several factors: human interference can severely damage or completely destroy nests which potentially devastates the nest population, and overshadowing is the main cause of a nest's demise. As well as that, neighbouring nests may increase in population if damaged or abandoned sites are taken over. Meat ants also rely on their nests to withstand climatic stress in summer and winter, as foraging activity and food sources are sometimes limited in summer, and in winter plant growth is almost impossible and workers are unable to survive cold temperatures. As a result, meat ants overwinter, which is a process where some organisms wait out the winter season due to cold conditions making everyday activity and survivability almost impossible; populations may be affected greatly. A queen meat ant burrowing a hole after her nuptial flight Most colonies are monogyne, meaning that a colony only has a single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain more than a single queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high proportion of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare. As most meat ant colonies rarely have a second queen, polydomy is not always associated with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to the high level of relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues play a vital role in nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity. =Ritualised fighting= Two workers engaged in ritualised fighting Meat ants are highly territorial and aggressive ants which establish firm borders between neighbouring colonies. While the boundaries are not physical, worker ants maintain them by engaging in ritualised fighting with opponent ants, an interaction most colonies engage in. Fatalities are rare on both sides, but fights may cause injuries to several workers. This fighting enables territory to be contested between opposing colonies without them killing each other and costing many casualties on both sides. Because of this, it is a method of avoiding casualties and promotes intercolony communication and assessment. A drainage of the work force would occur if these boundaries acted as a conflict zone if ritualised fighting did not take place. Lethal fighting only occurs if the colony is under attack. Encounters between workers last for 15 seconds. Ritualised fighting only occurs with two worker ants who come into contact with each other, but if both ants are from the same colony, they break contact and groom themselves. Afterwards they walk around until they make contact with another ant. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation (the act of touching with the antennae) and gaping of the mandibles, and stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants will do this in a display of size-matching. Workers perform a behaviour known as \\"front leg boxing\\"; both workers have their front legs sweeping up and down, where it would flex at the coxal joint in a paddling motion. This paddling motion is aimed at each other during the fight, going on for three to five seconds on average. From this point on, this would determine who is a \\"loser\\" and who is the \\"winner\\". The ant who lost the ritual fight will lower its body, and lean sideways from the victorious ant. The victorious ant will remain raised upward and reach down to the worker and open its mandibles wider, grasping on the opponent's mandibles, and then tug and shake its head slightly for a few moments. However, the fight may continue if neither worker backs down, and will commence a side to side posture. Both ants circle each other and present their gasters directed to their opponent, and on some occasions, either one or both of the ants would kick outward using their legs at each other. Eventually, they will break contact and groom once appeasement has been reached and continue to search for another ant. =Relationship with other organisms= common jassid nymph. These insects excrete a sugary sap that is collected by the ants, which protect this valuable food resource. Meat ants have been observed blocking banded sugar ant nesting holes with pebbles and soil to prevent them from leaving their nest during the early hours of the day. Banded sugar ants counter this by preventing meat ants from leaving their nest by blocking their nesting holes with debris, a behaviour known as nest-plugging. If meat ant nests are encroached by trees or other shade, banded sugar ants may invade and take over the nest, since the health of the colony may deteriorate from overshadowing. Members of an affected meat ant colony later move to a nearby satellite nest that is placed in a suitable area, while invading banded sugar ants fill nest galleries up with a black resinous material. Meat ants sometimes attract cats because of the chemicals they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin). Meat ants are generally intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) living in their colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines and live in the nest commensally. Unused or abandoned areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify. Meat ants play an important role in seed dispersal. A meat ant colony is capable of dispersing 334,000 individual bellyache bush seeds per hectare, which shows a strong ant-seed relationship among the two. Relationship with humans Meat ants are able to kill poisonous cane toads, an introduced pest, as the toxins exuded by the toad, usually lethal against its predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants as a form of pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants' aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest. =As pests= Despite their beneficial importance to humans, meat ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants disturbing the soil in urban areas and entering human houses occasionally to feed. The nests may cause annoyance if they are built around gravel paths, tennis courts and other cleared spaces. Although meat ants enter houses occasionally, they have adapted well to urbanisation and populations can flourish in urban areas. During the early days of the city of Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants. Unpaved streets, gravel paths and driveways are among the many new sites meat ants could nest in, making them a commonly encountered ant that may pose as a considerable pest to many. The abundance of food supplies from parks, plantations and home gardens also attracted meat ants to urban areas. They pose a serious problem for citrus growers in eastern Australia, because they affect the biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce honeydew. Meat ants cannot sting, but they can induce irritating bites and secrete a defensive fluid from the end of their abdomen. Meat ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry. Many attempted methods of eradicating meat ants have proven unsuccessful. The first investigations were made in the 1930s to control meat ant populations in urban areas by fumigation, using carbon disulfide and calcium cyanide. Although these methods successfully eradicated some nests, they were rapidly reoccupied by those living in satellite or rival nests. However, the reoccupation of these nests by incipient colonies (young colonies beginning to develop) does not occur. This is because colony founding is often difficult and rare when most areas are nested by mature colonies. This behaviour has led to long-term maintenance and repeated treatments to ensure the nests are not resettled. In addition, not all nests can be treated, and some may remain undetected from pest controllers. In 1973, Greaves notes that the poor penetration of insecticides into all nest galleries may be the reason why nests are reoccupied, but owing to the nest structure, the insecticides have to be poured into each individual hole as no gallery connects the holes to one another. Missing a single gallery can lead to the reoccupation of the nest site. Greaves concludes that dieldrin is the most effective insecticide to control meat ants, capable of killing the ants quickly and being the most long-lasting chemical used. The difficulty of eradicating meat ants has led to further studies. Two studies between 1996 and 2002 studied the effects of granular baits on meat ant colonies. Bait containing hydramethylnon and fipronil effectively reduced the number of workers foraging. However, this was only effective when of bait was placed on citrus trees or onto mounds. The ant bait Amdro was used in a recent study to identify an effective method of eradicating meat ants, but results showed that the bait failed to reduce ant populations significantly. There was evidence that the amount of active mounds declined, but this effect was only temporary. This is due to colonies only having of bait which was insufficient to eliminate further nests, but the effect may have been more dramatic if extra bait was used.

SitePal allows users to deploy \\"virtual employees\\" on websites that can welcome visitors, guide them around the site and answer questions. The use of SitePal on commercial websites has been controversial because many visitors report finding them annoying. Some research has shown that they can increase sales in comparison to using static photographs. Development The technology used was the result of more than 4 years of research at Stanford University. The research was based on a literature review and other previous work in the field of artificial intelligence research. The SitePal AI option uses the AIML programming language, which is partially editable by users. This allows web designers to simulate normal human conversation by using keywords or key phrases that the bot can respond to. Features The company provides web designers with options to customize the chosen avatar. A large selection of faces, clothing, hair, backgrounds, voices and other details are available. If a web designer wants to use a particular face, Sitepal can create one from a photo. Thus, a mascot or a known face can be simulated. Speech Sitepal avatars talk through text-to-speech (tts) software. A short paragraph can be written (up to 900 characters) and the text-to-speech engine will compile the actual speech, which can be reproduced and edited. The tts engine is not perfect, but it comes close to actual speech and is easy to understand. Tts can be further enhanced by some commands, like /laugh and /loud which make the avatar laugh or talk loud. Even pronunciation is possible. The web designer can record and upload his or her own audio messages. Alternatively Sitepal offers professional voice acting service at extra cost. User interaction The company provides 5 options for visitor interaction: * No interaction. The avatar simply says a pre-fixed message. * FAQ mode. Questions can be configured, which are clickable and the user can hear the answer. * Lead mode. The avatar prompts the user to type his email and short message, so it can be sent to the webmaster (usually used on a \\"contact us\\" page) * Chatbot mode. The avatar greets the user, and he can type his questions and have a conversation with the bot. With predetermined replies, this can work as an FAQ as well. * API customization. Experienced programmers can make their avatar interact with their website, making it talk when the user clicks on a link or when other triggers occur. Even dual avatar conversations can be created, like a talk show. Posting options The company provides five options for posting the avatar: * Embed in webpage (via javascript) * Embed in HTML * Send by email * Publish to eBay * Embed in Flash Criticism Early reviews, such as one by Troy Dreier published in PC World in 2002 were positive and described SitePal as: \\"an engagingly simple and personal tool, and the price is reasonable for what it adds to a site\\". Although Dreier did note that the program had \\"bugs that suggested it hadn't been tested thoroughly\\". In more recent years, reaction to SitePal has been much more negative with reviews such as Tom Spring writing in a PC World review citing SitePal ads and described his reaction as \\"Not so nice\\". Paul Bissex, writing in E-Scribe News described SitePal as \\"heinous... and embarrassing if anyone is within earshot...they creep me out\\" Research on effectiveness In one single-website research project Anita Campbell had half the visitors to Small Business Trends see a SitePal and the other half see just a static photograph.

Although the movie centers on a romantic love triangle with tragic consequences, it has a strong history background, set in Hungary during World War II. The film is based on the novel by Nick Barkow, co-written and directed by Rolf Schübel and tells a fictional story connected to the creation of the infamous song \\"Gloomy Sunday\\". Starring are Joachim Król (László, Jewish restaurant owner), Stefano Dionisi (András, pianist who creates \\"Gloomy Sunday\\"), Erika Marozsán (Ilona, waitress and László's and later András' lover) and Ben Becker (Hans Wieck, a German business man who becomes an SS officer). Plot summary In the present day, German industrialist Hans Wieck returns to Budapest with his family on the occasion of his 80th birthday having been stationed there during World War II. During dinner at his favorite restaurant, Szabó's, Hans regales his family and friends with stories of his many visits to the restaurant before and during the war. As he relishes his favorite dish, \\"Beef Rolls\\" he suddenly collapses with the song \\"Gloomy Sunday\\" being played, at his request, by two musicians. As he dies he sees a portrait of a beautiful woman taken many years before. The film then flashes back to Budapest during the late 1930s. Restaurant owner László Szabó (a Jew by birth) and his beautiful lover and waitress, Ilona (the woman in the photograph) hire a young pianist, András, to play in their restaurant. András falls in love with Ilona and she with him, though she continues to sleep with László. András is inspired to write the song \\"Gloomy Sunday\\" for Ilona's birthday, the same night that a young Hans (who also shares the same birthday) takes the picture of her and asks her to marry him, though she refuses him. Later that night Hans tries to commit suicide by jumping into the Danube, but László saves him and Hans returns to Germany. The resulting song \\"Gloomy Sunday\\" is recorded and though very popular at first soon becomes feared by the public for its melancholy melody which seems to trigger a series of suicides. András comes to regret writing the song and nearly attempts to kill himself but is stopped by Ilona and László before he can take a small vial of poison. András, László and Ilona form a tenuous relationship. It has its problems, as articulated by László to Ilona during an argument he is having with András in front of her: \\"Easy for you, you've got all you need. You have two men, and we each have only half a woman.\\" During Operation Panzerfaust, the Nazis invade Hungary and Hans returns as an SS officer responsible for organizing the deportation of Budapest's Jews to the death camps. Secretly, he saves the wealthiest Jews and smuggles them out of Occupied Europe in exchange for substantial bribes, including both goods and money. One night at the restaurant Hans brings a fellow SS officer to Szabó's and insists that András play his fateful composition. András refuses, but is compelled to do so when Ilona begins to sing the words of the song, something she has told him she would never do unless they were alone. When the song is over András kills himself by grabbing Hans's pistol and shooting himself in the head. After they bury András, László and Ilona pledge their love to each other and László puts the restaurant in her name to keep it from being confiscated by the Nazis. At Ilona's request Hans promises to protect László from being rounded up for \\"special treatment\\". However, shortly before the Battle of Budapest, László is rounded up and sent to the railway station to be sent to the death camps. Ilona hurries to Hans' headquarters to ask him to intervene, which he promises to do, making it clear that she must first sleep with him. A tearful Ilona submits, but Hans later reneges on the bargain, passing László by at the station and saving another Jew whose family had already paid him off. The flashback ends with the revelation of Ilona's pregnancy as she \\"speaks\\" to András at his grave, leaving the audience unsure as to who is the child's father. In the present, media reporters are paying tribute to the deceased Hans, as he is being put into the casket and driven away in a hearse. Ironically, Hans Wieck is now remembered not only as a wealthy industrialist but also as a Righteous Among the Nations who saved \\"a thousand Hungarian Jews\\" during the war. In the closing scene of the film, the middle-age waiter at Szabó's pours two glasses of champagne and returns to the kitchen, where his elderly mother (Ilona) is washing out András' now empty bottle of poison. Her son congratulates her on her birthday and the two embrace as the song \\"Gloomy Sunday\\" plays in the background.

Interfaith Officiants are trained in world religions and inter-spirituality, and can assist people in identifying their own spiritual beliefs through a process of spiritual self-discovery. Interfaith Officiants come from many different faith backgrounds and have different philosophies and personal theologies, yet are well-versed in a multitude of religious traditions. They share a commitment to serving individuals, couples and families in a very personal and respectful way, building ceremonies around the wishes, preferences, beliefs and practices of the clients they serve. Like hospital chaplains, Interfaith Officiants generally do not proselytize on behalf of any one faith tradition, but respect and honor them all. A number of Interfaith Seminaries and religious institutions train Interfaith Officiants, which are also sometimes called Interfaith Ministers or Interfaith Celebrants. Interfaith Officiants differ from Chaplains in that they usually work independently and serve the public at large, as opposed to Chaplains, who are employed by the military, hospitals, or other institutions. In 2010 The Council of Interfaith Communities of the United States was created, which is an umbrella for interfaith-interspiritual ministers who are going beyond celebrant status to engage and organize their couples in a lifetime community ministry to support interfaith families. The services of the minister include all of the life celebrations found in traditional faith organizations. The CIC-USA includes most of the first interfaith seminaries in the world including: The New Seminary (New York), One Spirit Interfaith Seminary (New York), Chaplaincy Institute for Arts and Interfaith Ministry (Berkeley, CA), Chaplaincy Institute of Maine (Maine), the American Institute for Holistic Theology (Alabama), and the Interfaith Academy for Interfaith Studies (Texas and Mexico), and the All-Paths Divinity School (Los Angeles, CA).

The series has been adapted as an anime television series called Bokurano directed by Hiroyuki Morita and produced by Gonzo that aired in 2007 and a light novel series called Bokura no: Alternative written by Renji Ōki, both with alternative storylines. In all incarnations, the series is about a group of middle-school students who unwillingly assume the task of piloting a giant mecha named Zearth in a series of battles against mechas from parallel worlds, where the survival of Earth is dependent on their continuing to win at the cost of the life of the pilot of each battle. The following is a list of characters from the manga and anime versions, including those exclusive to the anime. Main characters =Kokopelli= was the man who involved the children with Zearth, as well as the first pilot of the series. When the children first encountered him, he was hiding in a cave by the bay where the children were exploring. He seemed surprised to find them but persuaded the children into becoming pilots of Zearth by telling them he was looking for volunteers for a new game. Later, when the first battle takes place, he appears before the children within Zearth's cockpit, wearing a jet-black jumpsuit and sitting in a chair. From there, he teaches the children how to pilot Zearth as he destroys the first robot. During the battle, he explains that he is a human but not from their planet and that he has no concern for the lives of those who are killed in the crossfire. After the battle, he tells the children that it is now their responsibility to protect the Earth. As they are teleported out of the cockpit, Komo hears him start to whisper \\"I'm sorry.\\" Kokopelli is later revealed to be a teacher from the same alternate world as Koyemshi and Machi, named and nicknamed . =Takashi Waku= , nicknamed , was an energetic and confident young boy. He was previously a talented soccer player and is considered popular. He wanted to become a professional player and his friends thought he had the talent for it. However, he found out that his salary-man father was a soccer player just like him in his youth and even played at the national level. The fact that someone just like him didn't make it shook Waku's resolve and he stopped playing soccer. He was chosen to become the first pilot of the children. After his battle, the children celebrated on Zearth's chest. When Ushiro patted Waku on the back, he fell off the side into the ocean. They thought that Ushiro accidentally pushed him, but he actually died a moment before, when his time as a pilot ended. =Masaru Kodaka= , nicknamed , is the boy chosen to pilot Zearth during the third battle. He is a relatively quiet boy who likes to keep to himself. His father is a wary individual who runs a civilian contracting company. Kodama's two gifted older brothers hate their father and try to go towards a different path, however Kodama looks up to him and his status as a \\"chosen\\" man. Being raised by his father seems to have warped Kodama's sense of ethics and morality to the point where he enjoys to take shots at stray cats with a pellet gun. During his time as a pilot, he makes no attempt to avoid casualties and marvels at the death he causes. This sense of wonder is cut short when he is sent crashing down on top of his beloved father's car, killing his father instantly. For a moment, he is left completely stunned, but manages to shake himself out of it in time to defeat his opponent. He dies unceremoniously a moment later. Kodama's death alerts the other pilots to their fate. =Daiichi Yamura= , nicknamed , was a hard-working and responsible boy despite his gruff \\"no-nonsense\\" exterior. He dedicatedly took care of his three younger siblings: Futaba, Santa and Yoshi. He accepted this task because their mother had died much earlier, and their father abandoned them for unknown reasons three years ago. Their uncle on their father's side made up for his brother's disappearance by renting a home for the four siblings to live in, and paying for all expenses. Daichi earned his keep by working as a mail and newspaper boy, and for his uncle's landscaping business on his days off. He chose to live separately from his uncle with his siblings so that his father would have a place to return to if he ever decided to. During the fourth battle, Daichi refused to move until the citizens had sufficient time to escape, a practice later adopted by all future pilots. When the battle began, Daichi's will to protect his family gave him the strength to subdue his opponent long enough to carry it to the bay where no one else could get hurt. His last request to the group was for Ushiro to stop abusing Kana and take care of her, and for Koyemshi to discreetly dispose of his body so that his family would not mourn him. His story ends with his siblings going to the amusement park Daichi had protected during the battle with the tickets he had obtained for them. Following his death, his father returned. =Mako Nakarai= , nicknamed , is a girl who focuses all of her energy on living honestly and being an active benefit to the community in hopes that others would see her as a responsible and dependable person. Despite this, the well- known fact that her mother is a prostitute and her humorless, over-responsible attitude leaves her with no friends. Ever since elementary school, any kind of hatred or dishonesty tortures her, so much that she can't even raise a clenched fist at all of the kids who bully her, constantly having to keep to her duty and not protest in the slightest. Regardless, she looks up to her mother, and hopes to be able to stand proudly like she does. It was her mother's idea that she go to the nature school so that she would finally make some friends. Ever since the first battle, Mako has secretly been making uniforms for herself and the other pilots, but when she finds out that she would be the fifth pilot she is hard pressed for time and money to complete them. She feels the quickest way to attain the necessary money is to prostitute herself and manages to convince her mother's pimp to arrange a John for her. Much to her surprise, the man she meets is an old acquaintance of her mother's who drives her home after buying her dinner. Her mother, having found out about the plan gives Nakama her needlework money that she has been saving so that she wouldn't have to resort to such drastic measures. When the fifth battle begins, her opponent allows the populace time to evacuate which coincidentally gives Nakama the time she needs to finish the uniforms, though some are incomplete. Before returning to the cockpit, she finds out that one of the girls who bullies her is missing and uses Zearth's powers to locate her and teleport her out of harms way, after finally standing up to her. After defeating the enemy robot, she states that, if she is reincarnated, she wishes to return as a person just like her mother. Her story arc ends with the girls who bullied her finally helping clean the classroom. =Isao Kako= , nicknamed , was a troubled youth with many problems. He acted as an errand boy for a group of bullies to avoid being the subject of their abuse, and his parents would let him get away with just about anything, much to his older sister's chagrin. Kako's only \\"friend\\" was Kirie who also went to his school. Kako would constantly boss Kirie around since it made him feel less like a loser and Kirie would take this abuse without complaint. Kako in fact made Kirie accompany him to the nature school for this very reason. When he first entered the game, Kako was excited, hoping that his piloting Zearth would make him famous, but upon learning the price of piloting, he suffered a mental breakdown and hid in his room. His mental state was made even worse when Koyemshi visited him and told him that the other pilots were leaving him out of the loop and that he had so little time left. This pushed Kako overboard, and he went over to Chizu's house with every intention of raping her, but she stopped him at knifepoint. Moments later, he and the other pilots were retrieved by the army. While being held there, Kako experienced graphic nightmares involving him beating up on the bullies who would use him and raping the female one, or beating his sister and Chizu while they mocked him. While piloting Zearth, Kako hoped that the interference of the army would mean he wouldn't need to pilot and die. This hope was dashed when the futility of the army's attempts was made apparent. Kako then panicked and started running from the battle with no intention of stopping. The group was at a loss trying to find a way to get Kako to fight, but it was Kirie who finally spoke up and made a comment implying Kako's cowardice. This comment drove Kako into a rage and he began to mercilessly beat Kirie. Chizu stepped forward and stopped this display by stabbing her knife into Kako's throat and slitting his jugular. In the TV series, Kako did not even pilot Zearth. After he was visited by Koyemshi, he tried to make a move on Chizu by inviting her to visit an aquarium together, but she refused. When he was selected as the following pilot, he panicked and disappeared. Chizu found him in the aquarium and tried to cheer him up, but when he tried to force his way on her, she pushed him and he fell from a stair, rendered unconscious. Chizu fled away from the aquarium leaving him behind, when it was destroyed by a missile fired during the battle between the military and the enemy robot, and Kako, just after recovering his senses, was killed by the debris. The children discovered what happened when his lifeless body was teleported to Zearth's cockpit with them, and Chizu claimed the responsibility for his death, before being selected to replace him. =Chizuru Honda= , nicknamed , was relatively calm and a bit quiet, yet particularly disgusted by the one-track minds of her male classmates. Her chair was black and fancy, carefully designed, shapely, and looked very old. While at school Chizu was in love with her teacher, but was being deceived. He lured her into a date and then blackmailed her to being gang-raped by his friends. For this reason she began to carry a knife with her at all times. During the combat she revealed she was pregnant and used Zearth's power to kill all of the men who assaulted her, resulting in many civilian deaths in the process - except the teacher , because her older sister, who was in love with him too, stopped her. After she finished the battle, just before she dies, she laments at how her baby was to go to her instead of being born in her sister, and asks Koyemshi to put her body and that of her baby into one of the many spots in Zearth. After her death, the rest of children figured that Chizu's baby (who died with her) was also listed in the contract, which means that one of them, besides Kana, was not bound to it. Just like Kako's story, Chizu's scenario had a lot of changes in the TV series. She was seduced by her teacher just like in the manga, but instead of being blackmailed by him, he sold some pictures of them having sex which ended appearing on the internet. Despite having the faces digitally altered, they were identified by her classmates, which led to him being punished by the school's principal. He begged for Chizu's forgiveness, and just after she accepted his apologies, she discovered he was also dating her older sister. After Kako's death, she was chosen to assume his place. =Kunihiko Moji= , nicknamed , is a boy whose great intuition helped some of the previous pilots to defeat their enemies. Moji was kind and insightful, often ready to give advice and wisdom to his comrades when they needed it. The other children often came to him for advice. He had two childhood friends: a girl named Tsubasa Hiiragi and a boy named Nagi Namoto, who had a heart disease. Upon checking, Moji found out that his heart was a perfect match for Nagi. After his victory, Moji has Koyemshi transport him to a hospital where Nagi could receive his heart. His chair was a plastic chair with a metal frame back that curved around into a semicircle, which was the same chair in the hospital's room where Nagi was being kept. Moji had wanted to give his heart to Nagi so that Nagi and Tsubasa could be together, despite his own feelings for Tsubasa. Ironically, Tsubasa was actually in love with Moji and only stayed by Nagi so that he wouldn't feel alone, which Nagi knew from the beginning, and as such urged her to go after Moji once he was better. =Maki Ano= , nicknamed , is the adopted daughter of an anime otaku, and is expecting a baby brother. Due to her father's interests, she is extremely knowledgeable about military equipment, vehicles and practices; when she was younger, she and her father used to play transforming heroes and transforming robots. She also has some experience with sewing, though by her own admission she isn't very good, and she and Komo finish the costumes that Nakama was unable to complete. Before her battle, she goes to Ushiro to tell him he has to protect Kana for the sake of his family, and the next day she goes out with Komo and gets a complete feminine makeover at a beauty salon. This leads to a lament about how she wished she had never been a girl because she was scared of reflecting the possibilities of her birth mother's behavior, but now that she would have a brother she had to leave an image of herself as a girl. Though she loves her family, she is insecure about having been adopted. When she tells her father that he shouldn't be watching anime while his first child is being born, he replies matter-of-factly that she is his first child. Her battle begins the night after her mother enters labour. During the battle, she discovers that the robots that they have been fighting are in fact piloted by humans of parallel universes, and that the battles are the method for choosing which ones survive, and which ones don't. With every victory, 10 billion people from another universe die. As she finishes her battle, she uses Zearth's powers to see the birth of her baby brother. Later, it is revealed that Maki's family was not informed of her fate and continued to look for her, until they were personally visited by Machi and Ushiro. =Yōsuke Kirie= , nicknamed , was a fat boy who was often bullied. His depressed hikikomori cousin Kazuko, who was bulimic and cut her own wrists, made him wonder about the worth of his life and that of others. Yet after Chizu's battle he stabbed, non-fatally, the teacher who had abused her, with the knife that she had given him. He discussed his views about the lack of importance of individual human lives with Tanaka, as well as about sacrifices. He wondered if he could bring himself the courage to fight and kill another human, even knowing that the entire world's fate depend on it, and asks Tanaka to kill him and replace him if he fails to it. Before his battle starts, he shows himself to the opponent robot, and its pilot, a girl, does likewise, showing him the many cuts and slits along her arm. After this moment, Kirie finally finds his resolve to fight. His chair is fancy with 3 curved wooden legs, based on the one from Kazu's makeup desk. In the TV series, after being chosen as the next pilot, Kirie discovers his mother attempting suicide after months of unemployment and abandonment by her husband. Growing angry at the world that drove his mother to try to kill herself, he refused to fight when it was his turn. However, his opponent commits suicide in front of Zearth, ripping out and crushing its own cockpit. Despite the technical win, Kirie does not die, and in fact remains pilot for a second match. During the period between his two fights, his father returns to his mother after receiving news of her suicide attempt, and Tamotsu helps her find a job as a waitress. Seeing the world give his mother another chance at happiness, he decides to give the world another chance as well, which cements his resolve to fight in his second battle. Kirie is revealed to be a natural in piloting Zearth as he quickly and swiftly overwhelms the enemy robot. Before dying, Kirie confirms his suspicions about Machi and unveils her true identity as Koyemshi's sister. =Takami Komoda= , nicknamed , was the only daughter of a Navy official. It is through Komo that the army discovers the kids' involvement with Zearth. She was Maki's best friend since childhood. At first, Komo was rather quiet and bored by the world, preferring to read and play the piano alone, and secretly wondering if her father would have preferred a son instead. But as the time of her battle draws near, she goes outside to observe the world more closely and comes to appreciate how lively and beautiful it is. She almost loses her battle, but is saved when the enemy pilot discovers that Takami is the same age as his recently killed daughter, causing him to abandon his robot and runs away. The Japanese government sets up a plan to lure him up to a piano recital held by Komo after revealing to the world some bits of information regarding Zearth and its pilot's name. In the end, the enemy pilot attends the recital and is so moved by Komo's performance that he allows himself to be killed by her father a few minutes before the time limit. Komo's setup is far simpler in the TV series, as she simply defeats her enemy by herself. Her father, whose position was changed to a politician, plays a more significant role in the story, as he tries to use his influence to reveal to the world the truth behind Zearth and the children, which ends up costing him not only his career, but his life as well. =Aiko Tokosumi= , nicknamed , is the daughter of a newscaster who discovered her involvement with Zearth. Outgoing and energetic, though not very smart, Anko dreamed of being an idol singer. She told her father all of the truth when questioned by him, except about her ultimate fate. Anko's father and the military attempted to fabricate a story about Zearth and the children to soothe the public opinion. However, they were preempted by Karita, a boy who appeared on TV earlier falsely claiming he was a Zearth pilot and whose comments raised the public opinion's hate for Zearth, culminating in his assassination. Afterward, Anko's father received an authorization to broadcast his daughter's battle from inside the cockpit to the whole world. Even when seeing Anko in grave danger as the acid flowing from enemy's piercing needles managed to breach the cockpit, almost killing her and Machi, her father did not stop the transmission despite objections from the others. However, after sending these images to the world, messages supporting his daughter came to the station and he used them to encourage her to fight back. She managed to turn the tide of the battle by using the same needles the enemy robot pierced at Zearth's body to knock it down, and after the match was decided, her father revealed to her that he kept his cool at that moment because he was told about her inevitable death. After sending a message to the world apologizing for the casualties occurred during Zearth's battles, Anko sealed her victory by destroying the enemy cockpit, and died in her father's arms. Thanks to Anko's declaration, the army managed to create its official version of the story, claiming that Zearth's only pilots are Komo, Anko and the deceased Karita, in spite of all three now being dead. Anko's story is much different in the TV series. Her father is a journalist who is working with Komo's father and Kanji's mother not only to find a way to save the children from the contract, but also to reveal the truth about Zearth to the whole world, despite the government's efforts to hide it. He is forced to resign after his affair with a famous model is disclosed. Thanks to Kanji, with whom she became very close, she found the strength to bear the whole scandal, fight her enemy head-on and obtain a quick victory before passing on happily in his arms. =Kanji Yoshikawa= , nicknamed , is Ushiro's schoolmate and friend. Before his fight begins, he reveals to Ushiro that despite seeing him hurting Kana, he did not intervene because she asked him not to. He also reveals to him a secret that makes Ushiro start to change his point of view about her, and asks him to watch out for Machi. Kanji's opponent is by far one of the strangest who appeared in the manga as it first launches itself into the sky then lands in a very far away place - Hawaii to be exact, then starts to fire shots across the Pacific Ocean at Zearth, using needles it launched at the start of the battle as markers. After Japan attempts to defeat the enemy with a nuclear bomb and fails, Ushiro suggests to Kanji to use the lasers to target the enemy. Although Kanji could not directly target the enemy, a human soul could be used as a target, and Seki immediately volunteers. Koyemshi teleports Seki and 22 soldiers to where the enemy is, and Seki valiantly reaches the enemy in time for Kanji to fire, thus defeating it. After the victory, Kanji requests Koyemshi to teleport him to the top of the Chūtenrō tower where he contemplates who the next pilot will be in his final moments. Following his death, Kanji's father is prosecuted for the construction faults in Chūtenrō Tower, and he reveals to Machi and Ushiro that it will be demolished. Kanji's role in the story is far more elaborated in the TV series. Not only he is the son of Mitsue Yoshikawa, a lead researcher with the task of unlocking the secrets behind Zearth's technology, but he also ends up emotionally involved with Anko when her family is shaken by a scandal. It was by his support that Anko managed to gain strength enough to bear with her situation and defeat her enemy, and while he sadly holds her body as she passes out, he has a vision of some mysterious people whom he believes to be the masterminds behind the whole battles they have to fight. Koyemshi once stated to Machi that he chose Kanji to be the pilot for the final battle, but he changed his mind and had him battle earlier. =Kana Ushiro= , nicknamed , is Ushiro's younger sister. When the children entered into the contract, they were told that they would be \\"testing a game,\\" and Ushiro prevented Kana from joining as he didn't want her to have fun. However, it is later revealed that Kana had actually entered into the contract after Kokopelli's battle, before the children discovered the consequences of it. Despite being considered too kind to harm others even at the cost of herself, Koyemshi stated that she could stand a chance in the battle as younger the pilot, stronger is the vital energy provided to the robot, thus increasing its capabilities. She does so and dies. In the TV series, it is revealed that Ushiro and Kana are actually second cousins (her father is Tanaka's cousin), and Koyemshi tries to make her sign the contract too after Tanaka's death, but this fails due to Ushiro and Machi's combined efforts and Koyemshi's death. She ends up being the only child to survive in the end; the last episode features her entering middle school and befriending Daiichi's siblings, whom she tells the story of the Zearth battles. =Yōko Machi= Little is known about , nicknamed . Her parents are fishermen and she has described her older brother as being similar to Ushiro in behavior. She was the one who discovered Kokopelli's cave, and she was reluctant to sign the contract, but Waku pushing her hand onto the sensor forced her to become a part of it. Machi feels guilty about the deaths of all of the previous pilots because she was the one who led all the children into Kokopelli's cave. Machi is eventually revealed to be Koyemshi's younger sister, a human girl from a parallel Earth. It turns out that because Kokopelli and her home world's battle for existence was still taking place, Machi did not become a part of the contract since you cannot be part of 2 contracts at once. The usual chair she sits on actually belonged to Maki, but Machi signs the contract after Kana's victory, agreeing to fight for her adopted Earth. It turns out that Machi had a crush on Ushiro since the first time they met, confessing to him after their trip to visit all their friends' families. She is shot in the head shortly afterward by a mysterious man and ends up in a coma; Koyemshi decided to end her life himself since he thought it would have been the best choice, leaving Ushiro to take her place for the next battle. In the end, it turns out that a version of Machi already existed on this Earth, and was apparently replaced by the Machi from the parallel Earth. After the parallel Earth Machi's death, Koyemshi then returns this Earth's Machi to her family; she was in some sort of stasis and believed it was still the start of summer vacation shortly before the nature trip, which was most likely when the parallel Earth Machi replaced her. In the TV series, tired of seeing the same story of suffering and death being repeated at each world she passes as well as disagreeing heavily with Koyemshi's callous treatment of the Ushiro siblings, Machi ends up killing Koyemshi and helping Ushiro protect his sister by becoming one of the pilots, instead of Kana, like Koyemshi had planned. After winning her fight, she reaches some snowy ruins and dies while laying on the snow in front of Koyemshi's mutilated body, wishing that things had been different. =Jun Ushiro= , nicknamed , is a boy with a short fuse. Whenever he is upset by anything, the first thing he does is beat Kana, his younger sister. Ushiro's mother died giving birth to Kana, which would explain his hatred toward her. It is later revealed that Ushiro and Kana are not related, as Ushiro is actually Tanaka's son. Prior to Kanji's fight, Ushiro confides to him that he hadn't joined the contract with the others, revealing himself to be the one who is exempt from the contract. The chair he usually sits on actually belonged to Kana. After Kana's victory, Ushiro enters into the contract along with Machi, wanting to involve himself as opposed to \\"outsiders\\". Machi is chosen for the next battle, leaving Ushiro to fight the final battle. But after Machi's premature death during their trip to visit all their friends' families, Ushiro had to take her place for the 14th battle. In Ushiro's fight, the battle takes place on the opposing enemy's world. After a short battle, Ushiro defeats the enemy robot, but is tricked into opening the enemy cockpit which allows the pilots inside to teleport away and hide among the population of the city. Realizing with horror the enemy pilot does not have any intentions to win the battle or let herself be found, and due to the 48-hour limit rule for a winner, Ushiro has no choice but to kill everyone on the planet. After preparing himself mentally with Koyemshi, Ushiro launches the start of his genocide attack; he has a short freak out in the middle of it, throwing up on his own lap, but recovers and ultimately succeeds on his attack and destruction of the other planet, passing away shortly afterwards. He is shown to have joined the group of children in a dream sequence. In the TV series, Ushiro did enter into the contract along with the other children, and is eventually revealed to be the orphaned son of Tanaka and Ichirou, a murdered Yakuza heir and a friend of Sakakibara. After Kanji's battle, Koyemshi asks him to ask Kana to sign the contract in exchange for him becoming the very last pilot, who, according to the rules, has a chance to survive the battle if winning. However, Ushiro decides not to involve Kana in the contract, and asks Machi to help him get her free. After Machi's killing of Koyemshi and subsequent victory, Ushiro demands Seki let him become the next pilot and destroy Zearth after winning, relieving both of the successor's duty, and potentially sparing other parallel universes from the same ordeal. After a long 30-hour battle, Ushiro manages to defeat his enemy and save the Earth for good, dying alone but peacefully. =Koyemshi= A weird creature who calls himself and becomes the children's tutor after Kokopelli's disappearance. He is able to communicate verbally, and is usually very sarcastic. He responds to the children's call, and is able to teleport them, as well as others from the outside world to the cockpit, and vice versa. However, he cannot teleport directly between two places, and must go through the cockpit beforehand. Between battles, he can be seen conversing with an unknown party who is later revealed to be his younger sister, Machi. Like her, Koyemshi was once a human being involved in the battles for the survival of a parallel Earth. Koyemshi isn't a unique creature; there seems to be one for every Earth involved in the \\"game\\". At the end of the series, as a sort of atonement to Machi, Koyemshi returns to his human form and enters into his supporting Earth's contract in order to participate in the 15th and final battle for its existence, which also serves as the tutorial battle for the next set of pilots of the next world: in effect, becoming the next \\"Kokopelli\\". In the TV series, Koyemshi proves to be much more cruel than in the manga, mocking and demeaning the kids openly. By the end he tries to manipulate Kana into becoming the pilot by threatening to force Ushiro into doing so if she doesn't agree; however, he ends up being shot to death by Machi, who gets tired of his machinations and works against him upon Ushiro's requests. The TV series also reveals that, back when he was a human being called , he tried to amuse their guide in order to become the successor, thus being able to survive, but in the end, another child was chosen. He then begged for a chance to survive and the guide decided to accept his request by turning him into her replacement and giving him his current \\"Koyemshi\\" appearance. =Masamitsu Seki= is one of the officers who befriended the children and assumed one of the empty places in Zearth's group. He joined the military thanks to his fascination with Idol Defense Force Hummingbird. During Kanji's battle, Seki sacrifices himself in order for Kanji to defeat the enemy robot, creating another empty seat in the group. In the TV series, Seki threatened Koyemshi with a gun and had his right arm cut off by him, when he teleported his whole body, except for the hand which was holding the weapon to another place. By the time he signed the contract along Tanaka, it was already replaced with a mechanical prosthesis, which hides some sensors planted by Kanji's mother in order to gain access to information regarding Zearth's technology. In the end, he becomes the only contracted pilot to survive the battles. =Misumi Tanaka= is the other officer who befriended the children and assumed one of the empty places in Zearth's group. An intelligent and perceptive woman, she is married, with a 10-year-old daughter. Prior to her marriage, her name was , and she is actually Ushiro's mother. She left him with Kana's father (an old teacher of hers) thirteen years ago, as she didn't feel she had the right to raise him herself. To aid Kana in her battle, and foreseeing a battle outside their home world, she convinced Koyemshi to allow an advanced fighter jet to be teleported into the cockpit, and used it to shoot down the unmanned fighters deployed by the enemy world's army to help their robot. In the end, she is shot down and, after ejecting, is captured by the enemy robot. Fearing Kana would stop fighting to not harm her, she ends up killing herself with her own gun, just after Ushiro is told that she is his real mother. After her death her daughter Miku is seen visiting the remains of the fighter jet. In the TV series, Tanaka's husband was a Yakuza heir who was murdered by retaliation of his rivals. She left Ushiro at Kana's father's care, as he is a cousin of hers in the anime. She joined the military in hopes of becoming dependable enough to raise her child by herself, until her son was selected as a Zearth pilot and she was forced to intervene. She dies before having the chance to pilot Zearth, killed while facing the assassins of Komo's father. Other characters =Sasami= A member of the Department of Defense, is effectively Seki and Tanaka's boss, and the coordinator of everything Zearth-related in the Government. He arranged to have the kids picked up by the military after Komo's information of their relation to Zearth, and he has played various behind-the-scenes roles in the story. He has even appeared in Zearth's cockpit a few times to check up on things. Sasami was there to witness and support Ushiro's battle and reacts in horror to Ushiro's revelation over what he must do. After the final battle, Sasami takes on the role of Koyemshi to guide the next set of people in the next world. In an extra in the artbook released after the ending, it was shown that Sasami has finished supporting the next universe and safely made it back to his universe. =Tate= is often seen accompanying Sasami, and can only be assumed to be one of his head assistants. Tate's appearances in the manga have been infrequent so far. After his initial appearance in Kako's storyline, he was seen accompanying Komo at her rehearsal, and during Kanji's 32 hour battle, he appeared in Zearth's cockpit asking the kids and Tanaka if anyone needed a bathroom break. =Akira Tokosumi= is the journalist father of Anko. =Kunio Shōji= is one of the officers who were to supervise the children. He has a number of fingers severed after threatening Koyemshi at gunpoint during their first encounter. Due to his injuries and Koyemshi's enmity towards him, he does not take a role as one of the children's caretakers. It is later revealed that his fingers have been successfully reattached. =Tamotsu Sakakibara= is a convicted Yakuza who recently left prison after carrying a 10-year sentence and works for Ushiro's grandfather. He was also friends with his father to the point of feeling himself responsible for his death in part. By Tanaka's request, he assumed the task of aiding her to protect the children from harm. He also knows about Ushiro's connection with his employers, but hides the truth from him, despite sometimes accidentally calling him \\"botchan\\" (\\"little boss\\"). He appears only in the TV series.

The site includes the famous 10.7 meter Kivach waterfall on the Suna River. The reserve is situated about 20 km northwest of the town of Kondopoga in the Kondopozhsky District. It covers an area of . Topography The Kivach Reserve covers lake and forest territory just to the northwest of Lake Onega, where the terrain is rockier and more rugged than along the main shores of the lake. The Suna River runs through the reserve, over a ridge of Precambrian Diabase to create the waterfall for which the reserve is best known. The waterfall is diminished from its former size due to the construction of a dam upstream. The reserve's terrain is found in three main types: rocky ridges (the highest point is 160 meters above sea leve), hilly glacial moraines, and Quaternary glacial-lake plains. Climate and Ecoregion Kivach is located in the Scandinavian and Russian taiga ecoregion, which covers Northern Europe between tundra in the north and temperate mixed forests in the south. It is covers parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and the northern part of European Russia, being the largest ecoregion in Europe. The ecoregion is characterized by coniferous forests dominated by Pinus sylvestris (in drier locations), often with an understory of Juniperus communis, Picea abies and Picea obovata and a significant admixture of Betula pubescens and Betula pendula. The climate of Kivach is Humid continental climate, cool summer (Köppen climate classification (Dfc)).

He was married to Lha-bzang Khan's sister. Political and military action Tsewang Rabtan married his daughter, Boitalak (), to Danjung (), the eldest son of Lha-bzang Khan in 1714. He used the occasion to destroy some of Lha-bzang's troops in preparation for an invasion of Tibet. He consolidated Dzungar power by 1715, and in 1717 sent one army of 300 into Amdo to retrieve the 7th Dalai Lama, planning to consolidate Tibetan support by bringing him to Lhasa, and another army of 6000, led by his brother Tseren Dondub, that successfully took Lhasa from the Khoshut and killed Lha-bzang Khan. However, the first army failed to acquire the Dalai Lama, having been defeated by Qing troops at Kumbum. Dzungar troops went on the rampage through Lhasa and its environs, looting, raping and killing. Soon, the Tibetans were appealing to the Kangxi Emperor to rid them of the Dzungars. The Dzungar occupation of Tibet became more difficult to sustain as time passed and though they managed to defeat a poorly organized Chinese invasion at the Battle of the Salween River in 1718, Qing troops took Lhasa in 1720 during their second and larger expedition. After Danjung died circa 1717, allegedly at the hands of Tsewang Rabtan, Boitalak married a taisha or prince of the Khoid, a section of the Dzungar people, and later gave birth to Amursana (1723–1757), who would grow up to be Khan of Dzungaria during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor.

William married twice. His first wife was Christina (died 1246), daughter and co-heiress of Alan, Lord of Galloway. Her mother was one of the co-heiresses of the Earldom of Chester on the death of the last Earl in 1237. He claimed that, as a Palatine, it could not be divided, and his wife should get it as the oldest co-heir. He got the title, but the court decided that the lands should be divided, but this wife died in 1239 without issue. However, he and his wife quitclaimed the earldom to Henry III in 1241 in exchange for modest lands elsewhere. In 1241, on the death of his father, he inherited his lands, including honours associated with Cockermouth Castle in Cumberland, and Skipton Castle in Craven, Skipsea Castle in Holderness, both in Yorkshire. He joined Henry III in campaigns in Poitou and Wales in 1242 and 1245, but not in Wales in 1257 because he was ill. He held local offices in Cumberland, including justice of the forest for Cumberland in 1251, and sheriff of Cumberland in 1255 and keeper of Carlisle Castle, an office he held until his death. Two years after the death of his first wife, he remarried in 1248 to Isabella de Redvers (1237–1293), daughter of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon and Lord of the Isle of Wight. William de Forz died at Amiens in 1260. His widow Isabella, on the death of her brother Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon in 1262, inherited his lands and called herself Countess of Devon and Aumale. She had six children, all of whom pre-deceased her, including Thomas who died unmarried in 1269, and Avelina who married Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster in 1269, but died childless in 1274 aged 15.

The flower was named in honor of Jean-François Jacqueminot (1787-1865), a French general of the Napoleonic Wars. Its parentage is unclear, but 'Gloire des Rosomanes' and 'Géant des Batailles' are considered probable ancestors. The large, double flowers are extremely fragrant. Their colour is clear red to deep pink, displaying darker purple hues as they age, The reverse is paler with occasional white streaking. The bloom form is globular and high-centered, with 24 to 30 broad petals with wavy edges, and an average diameter of . The flowers develop from pointed, bright scarlet-crimson buds and appear in small clusters of 2 to 3 on long stems in a spring and autumn flush and scattered blooms in between. The vigorous shrub has many slightly hooked prickles of different sizes, and grows to be tall and up to wide. The foliage consists of five oval-round leaflets with a matte surface and a bright mid- to dark green colour. 'Général Jacqueminot' is winter hardy down to −26 °C (USDA zone 5), but rather susceptible to rust and mildew later in summer. 'Général Jacqueminot' quickly gained popularity as garden and as exhibition rose—it was listed among the roses of the Botanical Garden in Cape Town only five years after its introduction in France—and was the most commonly cultivated red variety worldwide for about fifty years. The cultivar also played an important role in hybridising, leaving a host of seedlings and sports, and is an ancestor of most modern red roses. In the 1880s, some cultivars considered very similar were deemed synonyms of 'Général Jacqueminot', even though they are distinct roses. These include 'La Brillante' (Verdier, 1862), 'Mrs. Cleveland' (Gill, 1889), 'Richard Smith' (Verdier, 1861), and 'Triomphe d'Amiens' (Mille-Mallet, 1859), a sport of 'Général Jacqueminot'.

Also known as Ercole da Ferrara and Ercole di Giulio Cesare Grandi, he has been claimed to be a favourite pupil of the painter Lorenzo Costa. Ercole Grandi first appeared in the historical record as being in the service of the house of Este in 1489. Between 1489 and 1495, Ercole Grandi seems to have been working in Bologna, both in San Petronio and in the Cappella Bentivoglio of San Giacomo Maggiore, as an assistant to Lorenzo Costa. In 1495, he was in Ferrara as the chief architect for realising Duke Ercole's plans to embellish the city and renovate the churches; the facade and interior of Santa Maria in Vado were executed from his design. He worked with Ludovico Mazzolino and others on the decoration of the Castello, and painted in the apartments of Lucretia Borgia. Also in Ferrara, he painted the frescoes for the church of San Pietro Martire (now demolished), although some frescoes are preserved. One problem in assigning attribution to the hand of Ercole Grandi is that none of his works is signed or dated, or accompanied by supporting documents, but he is thought by some scholars to have painted—in the manner of Mantegna—or had a hand in, the decorative frescoed ceiling in the Sala del Tesoro of the Palazzo Costabili (Palazzo di Ludovico il Moro) in Ferrara between 1503 and 1506. Other scholars attribute the work to Benvenuto Tisi da Garofalo. Confusingly, the identity of Ercole Grandi is sometimes conflated with Garofalo, and an Ercole da Bologna, and (most famously by the Renaissance historian, Giorgio Vasari) with that of Ercole di Antonio Roberti or Ercole de' Roberti (and see Filippini), who was first documented as being in Ferrara in 1479, and was author of the great frescoes of the Garganelli chapel in Bologna. Most of Ercole Grandi's works have been reattributed to other Ferrarese painters, such as Giovan Francesco Maineri and Lorenzo Costa, while other scholars insist that Ercole Grandi is a mythical character.

He was, with Frederick Handley Page, the co-inventor of the leading edge slot. Lachmann was born in Dresden, Germany, in 1896, the younger son of Gustav Anton Lachmann, an Austrian industrialist, and his wife, Leopoldine Wilvonseder. He served as a lieutenant in the German Army cavalry during World War I before transferring to the flying corps in 1917 and training as a pilot. During flight training he stalled and crashed, breaking his jaw. While hospitalised, he turned his mind to the cause of his crash. He concluded that a series of small aerofoils contained within a normal wing section would possess improved low-speed characteristics. He rigged up a primitive flow-visualiation rig using a fan and cigarette smoke to confirm his ideas.Barnes, C.H. Handley Page Aircraft since 1907 London, Putnam 1987 p.125 He attempted to patent the principle, but the application was initially rejected by the German Patent Office on the basis that there was no proof that it would work. Lachman gave up the idea and enrolled at Darmstadt Technical University, for a course in mechanical engineering and aerodynamics. He graduated in June 1921 and took a job with the Opel factory. By chance, he read an account of Frederick Handley Page's public demonstration of leading-edge slots given at Cricklewood on 21 October 1921. This encouraged him to renew his patent application. He borrowed DM 1000 from his mother to pay for wind-tunnel tests, to be undertaken by Ludwig Prandtl at Göttingen University and the patent was retrospectiverly granted as DE 347884.Pride and Priority, Musker 2009 This gave his patent priority over those of Handley Page, but a meeting between the two men settled the matter to mutual advantage, the patent rights being shared, and Lachmann being hired as a consultant by Handley Page Ltd. In 1923, his doctoral thesis The Slotted Wing and its Importance for Aviation was accepted by Aachen Technical University. He then spent time as a designer at the Schneider aircraft works in Berlin before becoming chief designer at the Albatros aircraft works at Johannisthal in 1925, where he designed the Albatros L 72 and the twin-engined Albatros L 73 eight-passenger transport. In 1926, Lachmann resigned from Albatros to join the Ishikawajima Aircraft Works in Tokyo as a technical adviser. He left Ishikawajima in 1929 to take a job with Handley Page in the United Kingdom as engineer in charge of slot development. In 1932, he was appointed chief designer, designing the H.P 54 Harrow and Hampden aircraft. In 1936, he was appointed to set up a special research department to work on a tailless aircraft design, the Handley Page H.P.75. Lachmann was regarded with suspicion by the British counter-intelligence service MI5 as a possible spy. On the outbreak of World War II, Lachmann was sent to Quebec on the Duchess of York as an enemy alien and also interned on the Isle of Man, but, after pressure from his employers, he was eventually permitted by the authorities to continue his work for Handley-Page in Lingfield Prison. In 1949, he became a British citizen. He stayed with Handley-Page for the remainder of his career, eventually becoming head of research, until 5 months before his death at Chorleywood, Hertfordshire, in 1966.

Early life Born in Scotland, he was the son of a construction consulting engineer. Steele came to America with his family at an early age, settling in Northern California. A very skilled horseman, he played polo competitively as a young man and also worked for a time in a steel mill, which was the source of his professional name Tom \\"Steele.\\" Steele was a student at Stanford University, where he had a football scholarship. Film career At the start of the Depression he relocated to Hollywood to become an actor, and made his film debut in 1930 in the Western The Lone Star Ranger. But soon Steele, relying on his skill as a horseman (he had played polo professionally with the San Mateo Redcoats), changed to stunts for better money and regular work. Despite this he can be seen playing many bit parts throughout his career, mostly as \\"heavies\\" or minor henchmen, whose main role was to be part of a fight scene. His visible but non-speaking role as a prison guard in 1947's Brute Force is a good example of this. During the 1930s Steele worked frequently at Universal with a group of fellow stuntmen who called themselves \\"The Cousins.\\" None were related, but they all pitched in to help each other with their gags and refine the art of stuntwork. Steele, in fact, is credited with the idea of wearing stunt pads, which he first fashioned from old football padding. The Cousins also included David Sharpe, Carey Loftin, Eddie Parker, Ken Terrell, Bud Wolfe, Louis Tomei and Loren Riebe. Steele and Sharpe were still working together well into the 1970s on such films as Blazing Saddles (Steele is the townsman who falls out of his chair at the sight of Sheriff Bart, and Sharpe is the man flipped and dragged through the mud by the villains). Steele took over from Sharpe as stunt coordinator at Republic when Sharpe left to serve in World War II in 1942 (Steele himself was declared 4-F due to an old injury incurred at the steel mill). Steele was the only stuntman ever to be signed to a term contract (June 1943-June 1944) by Republic. He doubled for such serial leading men as Rod Cameron (who started as a stuntman himself), Richard Bailey (who rather resembled Steele), Clayton Moore, and football star Sammy Baugh. In the 1940s and early 1950s, many actors at Republic were selected due to their resemblance to Steele rather than the opposite. In features, Steele was Wild Bill Elliott's regular double. His most notable role at Republic was as the title hero in the 1943 serial The Masked Marvel, for which he ironically received no billing whatsoever (the character was supposed to be one of four leading men—none of whom were Steele). As the Masked Marvel Steele's voice, which was a rather light, high tenor not unlike Henry Fonda's, was dubbed by the more heroic-sounding radio actor Gayne Whitman. Steele also worked extensively outside of Republic, appearing in such classic feature films as Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), Santa Fe Trail ('40), in which he doubled Raymond Massey, The Big Sleep, in which he doubled John Ridgeley, and The Thing (From Another World) ('51) in which he stood in for James Arness as the title creature in the scenes involving fire and a dog attack, and even Citizen Kane(!), in which Steele can be glimpsed as an aggressive reporter jumping onto the running board of Kane's car as it pulls away. Later life In the 1960s and 70s he remained active as a stuntman but took on more acting bits, including a role as a truck driver in 1966's Harper and a bit as a security guard in the 1971 Bond epic Diamonds Are Forever. He also drove one of the vehicles used in the classic car chase from Bullitt (1968) and did driving stunts for Disney's late-1960s \\"Love Bug\\" films. His last film before retiring was 1986's Tough Guys, in which he played an elderly man caught up in a bank robbery. In his last years, Steele was a frequent participant at Western and Serial film festivals around the country.

The first book was published in 2001. By 2011, the first book had reported sales of more than 1.4 million hardcover copies, and the series had grown to five titles. Publishing history Kotzwinkle and Murray conceived the idea for the first book in 1990, inspired by a real-life dog named Walter, whose owner fed him doughnuts and beer and who was prone to foul-smelling flatulence. With assistance from Kotzwinkle's wife, Elizabeth Gundy, they devised a story about a dog who overcomes two burglars with his smelly farts. Eleven years passed before they found a willing publisher, North Atlantic Books, and the right illustrator, Audrey Colman. The book was a success and reached the top of The New York Times children's best seller list. Beginning with the second book, the series has been published by Penguin Books, and Gundy began receiving credit with the third book. In 2008, it was reported that plans were under way to develop the series as a movie project for the Jonas Brothers. As of summer 2011, the Jonas Brothers were no longer attached, and Tim Hill was in discussions to direct the film for producers Mary Parent and the Farrelly Brothers. Reception The books have been criticized by some as an example of \\"poop fiction\\" for children (in the same vein as titles such as Captain Underpants and Zombie Bums from Uranus); they have been subjected to occasional complaints and attempts to have the books withdrawn from libraries, and some librarians and bookstores have refused to carry the series. On the other hand, librarians (and others) have credited the books with effectively attracting young readers who might otherwise be hard to reach. In addition, many copies have been sold to adults. White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten reportedly kept the book in his office as a \\"conversation- starter\\". The New Statesman's John Sutherland, comparing Walter to the 1956 children's classic Harry the Dirty Dog, commented that Walter \\"is to Harry as Portnoy was to sexually uptight Holden Caulfield - dirtier\\". Noting that the \\"books carry the epigraph 'For everyone who is misjudged or misunderstood'\\", he concluded that they are ultimately about promoting \\"self-esteem\\".

It was built in the early 16th century, and is a category A listed building. The building is a five-storey oblong tower house. The four-storey wing to the rear was added in the early 18th century. From 2014, Ackergill Tower was operated as an events and wedding venue by AmaZing Venues, before being sold to US philanthropist, Dr Betsee Parker in February 2019. History =Early history= The Clan Keith, under John Keith of Inverugie, inherited the lands of Ackergill in 1354 from the Cheynes family. Ackergill Tower may have been built by his son, but was first mentioned in 1538. A legend relates the tale of a young woman by the name of Helen Gunn, who was abducted by John Keith for her beauty. She flung herself, or fell, from the highest tower to escape her abductor's advances. Supposedly her ghost is still seen. This was in the late 14th or early 15th century and is said to have been the true beginning for all feuding between the Gunns and the Keiths. It led to the Battle of Champions in either 1478 or 1464, a judicial combat which led to a massacre of the Gunns by the Keiths at the chapel of St Tear (or Tayre) just east of the village. =Keiths and Sinclairs= In 1547, the Sinclairs of Girnigoe attacked and seized the castle. Mary of Guise, then Regent of Scotland, granted the Sinclairs remission for this and returned Ackergill Tower to the Keiths. She later installed Laurence Oliphant, 4th Lord Oliphant, as keeper of Ackergill in 1549. The Sinclairs again captured the castle in 1556, for which they were again granted remission. John Keith, Captain of Ackergill, was present at the death of Mary of Guise at Edinburgh in 1560.HMC 3rd Report: Murray (London, 1872), p. 412. In 1593, Robert Keith, brother to George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal (who rightfully owned the tower), seized Ackergill by force, for which he was declared a rebel, and the castle was returned to the Earl.Miles Kerr-Peterson, A Protestant Lord in James VI's Scotland: George Keith, Fifth Earl Marischal (Boydell, 2019), pp. 65, 69. In September 1597 John Keith of Subster attacked the tower in the dead of night, climbing the walls with ladders, taking its occupants by surprise and capturing the place.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 455. In 1612, the Sinclairs acquired Ackergill Tower once again, but through legal means, when it was sold to the Earl of Caithness by the Earl Marischal. However, by 1623 it was under assault once more, when it was besieged by Sir Robert Gordon during his feud with George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness. The Sinclairs surrendered the castle before any assault took place. In 1651, Oliver Cromwell may have used Ackergill Tower to garrison his troops during his siege of the Keith's Dunnottar Castle, when he was hunting for the Honours of Scotland. In 1676, John Campbell, 2nd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland took possession of Ackergill Tower in repayment of debts owed to him by the Sinclairs. =Later history= John Campbell put Ackergill Tower up for sale in 1699, and it was bought by Sir William Dunbar of Hempriggs. The Dunbars began extensive renovations, including the addition of a lean-to-shaped extension to the tower. In the mid-19th century, further additions including a cap house were made by the architect David Bryce on behalf of George Sutherland Dunbar, 7th Lord Duffus. In 1963, Maureen Blake, who as a girl lived with her mother and C. S. Lewis for about twenty years, became the eighth baronetess of Hempriggs and the steward of Ackergill Tower until it was sold in 1986. The castle underwent a two-year period of restoration work before opening as an exclusive hotel and business venue. The tower was sold again in 2009, and the new owners, AmaZing Venues, part of Clarenco LLP, acquired a five-star rating in 2012 having spent £2 million upgrading facilities. The tower was sold once more in 2018, and returned to private ownership.

These attacks in 1924 marked the second confirmed case of mustard gas being dropped from airplanes, a year before the signing of the Geneva Protocol for \\"the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare\\". The gas used in these attacks was produced by the \\"Fábrica Nacional de Productos Químicos\\" (National factory of chemical products) at La Marañosa near Madrid; a plant founded with significant assistance from Hugo Stoltzenberg, a chemist associated with clandestine chemical warfare activities in the early 1920s who was later given Spanish citizenship. Research and revelations The Spanish bombings were covered up but some observers of military aviation, like Pedro Tonda Bueno in his autobiography La vida y yo (Life and I), published in 1974, talked about dropping toxic gases from airplanes and the consequent poisoning of the Rif fields. Likewise, Spanish Army air arm pilot Ignacio Hidalgo de Cisneros, in his autobiographical work Cambio de rumbo (Course change), reveals how he witnessed several chemical attacks. Years later, in 1990, two German journalists and investigators, Rudibert Kunz and Rolf-Dieter Müller, in their work Giftgas gegen Abd El Krim: Deutschland, Spanien und der Gaskrieg in Spanisch-Marokko, 1922-1927 (Poison Gas against Abd El Krim: Germany, Spain and the Gas War in Spanish Morocco, 1922-1927), proved with scientific tests that chemical attacks had indeed occurred. The British historian Sebastian Balfour, of the London School of Economics, in his book Deadly Embrace, confirmed massive use of chemical arms after having studied numerous Spanish, French and British archives. According to his research, the strategy of the Spanish military was to choose highly populated zones as targets. Additional evidence is found in a telegram from a British official, H. Pughe Lloyd, sent to the British Minister of War. Background According to Sebastian Balfour, the motivation for the chemical attacks was based primarily on revenge for the defeat of the Spanish Army of Africa and their Moroccan recruits the RegularesVolunteer infantry and cavalry units of the Spanish Army recruited in Spanish Morocco. These Moroccan troops played a major role in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39) at the Battle of Annual on July 22, 1921. The Spanish defeat at Annual left 13,000 Spanish and Moroccan colonial soldiers dead according to the official count, many of them killed in cold blood after surrendering to the Rif armies, and led to a major political crisis and a redefinition of Spanish colonial policy toward the Rif region. The political crisis led Indalecio Prieto to say in the Congress of Deputies: \\"We are at the most acute period of Spanish decadence. The campaign in Africa is a total failure, absolute, without extenuation, of the Spanish Army.\\" The Minister of War ordered the creation of an investigative commission, directed by the respected general Juan Picasso González, which eventually developed the Expediente Picasso report. Despite identifying numerous military mistakes, it did not, owing to obstructions raised by various ministers and judges, go so far as to lay political responsibility for the defeat. Popular opinion widely blamed King Alfonso XIII who, according to several sources, encouraged General Manuel Fernández Silvestre's irresponsible penetration of positions far from Melilla without having adequate defenses in his rear. The use of the chemical agents Spain was one of the first powers to use chemical weapons against civilians in their use against the Rif rebellion. Between 1921 and 1927, the Spanish army indiscriminately used phosgene, diphosgene, chloropicrin and mustard gas (known as Iperitacomes from French language Ypérite in reference to Ypresetymology).Enrique Cerro Aguilar. \\"España fue el primer país que utilizó armas químicas contra civiles en Marruecos en 1920\\". Revista Rebelión. 13 de enero de 2001. - Common targets were civilian populations, markets, and rivers. In a telegram sent by the High Commissioner of Spanish Morocco Dámaso Berenguer on August 12, 1921 to the Spanish minister of War, Berenguer stated: On August 20, 1921, Spain asked Germany to deliver mustard gas via Hugo Stoltzenberg, although Germany was prohibited from manufacturing such weapons by the Treaty of Versailles of 1919. The first delivery occurred in 1923. The use of chemical weapons against the Rif was first described in an article of a (now defunct) Francophone daily newspaper published in Tangier called La Dépêche marocaine dated on November 27, 1921.La Dépêche marocaine, November 27, 1921. Copy in AMAE España, Fondo Manuel González Hontoria, Caja 4, Marruecos (1910-22), page 2. Historian Juan Pando has been the only Spanish historian to have confirmed the usage of mustard gas starting in 1923. Spanish newspaper La Correspondencia de España published an article called Cartas de un soldado (Letters of a soldier) on August 16, 1923 which backed the usage of mustard gas. According to military aviation general Hidalgo de Cisneros in his autobiographical book Cambio de rumbo,Hidalgo, de Cisneros. Cambio de Rumbo - p. 193-7 he was the first warfighter to drop a 100-kilogram mustard gas bomb from his Farman F60 Goliath aircraft in the summer of 1924. About 127 fighters and bombers flew in the campaign, dropping around 1,680 bombs each day. Thirteen of these planes were stationed in the military air base of Seville.Informe sobre la actuación de la Aviación en el Protectorado. 4 Mar. 1924. AGA Africa, caja M12, exp. 2. The mustard gas bombs were brought from the stockpiles of Germany and delivered to Melilla before being carried on Farman F60 Goliath airplanes.Hidalgo, de Cisneros. Cambio de Rumbo - p. 193-4 Legacy =Alleged toxic effects= The Association for the Defence of Victims of the Rif War considers that the toxic effects are still being felt in the Rif region. However, no scientific study has proven to date the relationship between the usage of chemical weapons and the high rate of cancer in the area.50% of cancer cases in Morocco are concentrated in the Rif region. - Ilyass Omari, head of the \\"Association of Toxic Gas Victims\\" (ATGV) told Morocco Times =Bill of acknowledgment= On February 14, 2007, the Catalan party of the Republican Left (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya) passed a bill to the Spanish Congress of Deputies requesting Spain to acknowledge the \\"systematic\\" use of chemical weapons against the population of the Rif mountains. The bill was rejected by 33 votes from the governing Socialist Labor Party and the opposition right-wing Popular Party who form the majority in the Spanish parliament.

The main combatants were two Canadian infantry divisions—with additional support from the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—against elements of three German SS Panzer divisions. The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts to break out of Caen, and took place from 19 to 25 July 1944, being part of both Operation Atlantic (18–21 July) and Operation Spring (25–27 July). The immediate Allied objective was Verrières Ridge, a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise. The ridge was occupied by battle- hardened German veterans, who had fallen back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge. Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 76. From the perspective of the Canadian 1st Army, the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations—the most notable being a highly controversial attack by The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada on 25 July, in which 315 of its 325 soldiers were killed, wounded or captured. This attack—the costliest single day for a Canadian battalion since the 1942 Dieppe Raid—has become one of the most contentious and critically analysed events in Canadian military history.Bercuson, p. 223.Zuehlke, p. 168.Copp (1999a). While failing to achieve its original objective, an important strategic result of the Battle of Verrières Ridge was to aid the overwhelmingly successful Operation Cobra, by tying down powerful German Panzer formations that might otherwise have been moved to counter-attack Cobra. Background Verrières Ridge lies south of the city of Caen, overlooking broad plains and dominating the countryside between Caen and Falaise. Although a major D-Day objective for Commonwealth forces, the Allied push inland was halted short of Caen and positional warfare ensued until the first week of July.Zuehlke, p. 163. On 9 July, Operation Charnwood succeeded in taking the northern half of the city, but the I SS Panzer Corps maintained defensive positions in the remainder of Caen.Van Der Vat, p. 155. A week later, Operation Goodwood renewed the British offensive, and Caen finally fell on 19 July, although by this time the city had been largely devastated.Van Der Vat, p. 157. The next Anglo-Canadian goal was the town of Falaise, but Verrières Ridge—now strongly defended by the I SS Panzer Corps—stood in their path.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 75. Elements of the British 2nd Army secured part of the adjacent Bourguébus Ridge and managed to gain a foothold on Verrières Ridge but were unable to dislodge its German defenders.Copp (1992), p. 45. Forces involved The geography of Verrières Ridge and the surrounding area The Canadian II Corps—commanded by Lieutenant- General Guy Simonds—initially assigned two infantry divisions and one armoured brigade to the assault on the German positions around Verrières. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division—having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign—was given a supporting role.Bercuson, p. 220. The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh, though relatively inexperienced, Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade.Bercuson, p. 222.D'Este, p. 205. Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps: the 51st (Highland) Division, the Guards Armoured Division, and the British 7th Armoured Division.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 78. Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts, the British units played a minor part in the battle.Bercuson, p. 221.Jarymowycz (2001), p. 128. While British forces had been battling for Caen, elements of Dietrich's I SS Panzer Corps—part of Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge's Army Group B—had turned Verrières Ridge into their main defensive position along the Anglo-Canadian front.Jarymowycz (2001), p. 132. Although not particularly high, the ridge's topography meant that advancing forces would be exposed to fire from German positions across the River Orne, from the ridge and from the nearby German- held industrial hamlet of St. Martin.O'Keefe Two powerful formations—the 12th SS and 1st SS Panzer Divisions—held the ridge supported by artillery, dug-in Tiger tanks and mortar emplacements.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 77. A third—the 9th SS Panzer Division—was held in reserve. Further support was available from the 272nd Grenadier Infantry Division (a force composed mainly of Russian and Polish combatants that had been raised in 1943), the 116th Panzer Division and a battalion of Tiger tanks. Battle =Attack of Calgary Highlanders= In a follow-up to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress. Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions on either side of Point 67. The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in, despite accurate return fire. Over the next few hours, they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains. Against a tenacious German defence and minor infantry and tank counter-attacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, with the goals of capturing both the eastern side of the Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge. =Operation Atlantic= VE-Day. PAC Photo The next attack took place on 20 July as part of Operation Atlantic. It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment, with supporting units from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. In the early hours of 20 July, the Camerons secured a position in St André-sur-Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks.Bercuson, p. 220 At the same time, the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge, supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft. The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain, which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud. Counter-attacks by two Panzer divisions threw the South Saskatchewans back past their support lines and their supporting battalion—the Essex Scottish—came under attack.Zuehlke, p. 166. The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it tried to hold back the advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division, while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in Operation Goodwood, the largest armoured battle of the campaign.BBC: People's WarVan Der Vat, p. 159. By the end of the day, the South Saskatchewans had taken 282 casualties and the ridge was still in enemy hands. Despite these setbacks, Simonds was adamant that Verrières Ridge should be taken and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to stabilise the precarious Allied position. Minor counter-attacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations and by the time the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point 67.Bercuson, p. 224.Copp (1992), p. 47. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties. =Operation Spring= The start lines of Operation Spring, showing layout of divisional and battalion forces for both sides With the capture of Caen on 19 July, an Anglo-Canadian breakout had become strategically feasible. In the American sector, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley—commander of the U.S. 1st Army—had been planning his own breakout (codenamed Operation Cobra) and Simonds too began preparing a new offensive, codenamed Operation Spring. Spring was originally conceived by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery as a \\"holding attack\\", designed to tie down German forces while Cobra was under way. On 22 July, however, with Operation Atlantic having failed to achieve its aims, Simonds changed the objective of Operation Spring to a breakout offensive.Copp (1992), p. 46. With Verrières Ridge taken, Simonds could launch armour and artillery attacks from its southern flank to push the Germans further back. This would clear the Caen-Falaise road, and his two British armoured divisions could then advance south to Falaise. Operation Spring was scheduled in four tightly timed phases. The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May-sur-Orne to secure the flanks of the main thrust, which was to be a move on Verrières Ridge by the Black Watch, along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division. The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours. Taking advantage of this respite, the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions, 480 tanks and 500 guns.Copp (1999b). Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds's headquarters. On 25 July, two days later than originally planned owing to the weather, Operation Spring was launched. The Black Watch were scheduled to begin their attack at about 05:30 from an assembly area at St Martin, south of Caen. The Canadians ran into heavy German resistance on the St Martin road and did not arrive at their assembly area until close to 08:00. By that time, the Black Watch's two highest-ranking officers had been killed and command fell to Major Phil Griffin. At 08:30, he met with 5th Brigade commander, Brigadier General W. J. Megill and despite the non-arrival of most of their promised armoured support, the decision was taken for the attack to proceed.Copp (1992), p. 55. At 09:30, as the Canadian infantry regiments advanced up the ridge, they were easy targets for the well-entrenched German machine gun nests and mortar pits, supported by tanks, anti-tank guns, and Nebelwerfer rocket artillery. To make matters worse, the Black Watch communications were knocked out within minutes of the start of their assault. Very few members of the Black Watch Regiment managed to make it to the crest of the ridge and those who did were subjected to an even heavier bombardment as they ran into the counter-attacking forces of the 272nd Infantry Division and the 9th SS .Bercuson, p. 225.Jarymowycz (1993), pp. 83, 134. Of the 325 men that left the assembly area, 315 were killed, wounded or captured. The Black Watch lost all its senior commanders, including Major Phil Griffin, with two companies virtually annihilated.Stacey (1960), p. 192. Aftermath German counter- attacks in the aftermath of Operation Spring, 25–26 July 1944 All of the gains made by the Black Watch and Calgary Highlanders were lost to German counterattacks, which inflicted heavy losses on the Highlanders and the previously unscathed Black Watch support company.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 82. The Black Watch had to be reformed after Verrières Ridge, having sustained more casualties than any Canadian infantry battalion since the disastrous 1942 raid on Dieppe.Bercuson, p. 226. The central area of the ridge near Verrières Village was eventually taken and held by the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 79. The east side was also taken, but subsequently lost, although two British armoured brigades were able to secure significant footholds near the positions of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry.Jarymowycz (2001), p. 135. The failure to capture the ridge had little effect on the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so overwhelming that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from the ridge in their attempt to keep Bradley's forces boxed in.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 84. With German defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 87.Bercuson, pp. 228–229. =Casualties= Allied casualty figures for the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations. The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured.Jarymowycz (1993), p. 81. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise. The Canadian Official Historian Charles Stacey, and military historian Michael Reynolds, wrote that German casualty figures for individual operations are difficult to determine. Stacey attributes this to the gradual degradation of the German logistics chain, leaving incomplete records, and Reynolds wrote that units sometimes over-reported their losses, in the hope of receiving more reinforcements.Stacey (1960), pp. 270–271.Reynolds, p. 198. German losses for the battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by the Canadians. According to Reynolds, between 16 July and 1 August, the 1st SS Panzer Division lost 1,092 men killed, wounded or captured—along with 11 Panzer IV tanks and 10 Sturmgeschütz III self-propelled guns—in fighting across all its fronts including at Verrières. Over a similar period, he estimates the 12th SS Panzer Division—in all sectors—suffered only 134 casualties. Many of the German fallen are buried at La Cambe German war cemetery. Historiography and controversy Montgomery (eighth from left) talking with Simonds (ninth from left) at II Canadian Corps Headquarters in Normandy, France, 20 July 1944. Photo by Lt. Donald I. Grant The Battle of Verrières Ridge —although given no particular prominence in German military history — is one of the First Canadian Army's most scrutinised actions. The matter was first brought to public attention by Stacey, who wrestled with the question of how to present the battle in the Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War, and was required to make minor changes to the narrative of the battle by Simonds. At the time Stacey was writing the history, as senior historian of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army, Simonds was the Chief of the General Staff of the Canadian Army, effectively his boss.Stacey (1980), pp. 1–293. The report on Operation Spring by Simonds was released after the war and blamed its failure on \\"11th hour reinforcement\\" of German lines and \\"strategically unsound execution on the part of Major Phillip Griffin and the Black Watch\\".Simonds, pp. 67–68. Declassified wartime documents show that Simonds, along with several others in the Allied high command, had likely been notified on 23 July of a massive German build-up on the ridge.Copp (1992), p. 50. Some historians, including David O'Keefe and David Bercuson, accused Simonds of being careless with the lives of his men. Terry Copp and John A. English wrote that, given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy, Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made.Copp (1992), p. 61. Operation Spring succeeded in its later-defined objective of a \\"holding attack\\" and aided the overwhelming success of Operation Cobra, by tying down powerful German formations that might otherwise have been in the American sector, thus precluding any immediate inquiry into its failure.Simonds, p. 65. The German commander of the Normandy Sector—Günther von Kluge—was at the Canadian front on 25 July, instead of the American front where the eventual breakout occurred.Bercuson, p. 227. The Battle of Verrières Ridge had little overall effect on British attempts to break out of Caen, as significant resources were transferred to the American front in the aftermath of Cobra, to exploit Bradley's success; the ridge eventually fell to the general Allied advance.

It borders Northgate Boulevard to the west, Indiana Avenue to the north, the East Levee Basin to the east, and the Arden-Garden Highway to the south. It is the richest agricultural area within city limits. Many residents that reside in Gardenland argue that Gardenland is from Bowman Ave to Columbus Ave surrounded by the levee and Northgate Boulevard, with Bowman Ave as the center because of the park and the levee. History Gardenland was established during the 1920s, by immigrant farmworkers and railroad employees and was named Gardenland because of the trees; others say because of the large land lots where anything \\"grew\\", whatever the case it is a haven of rich agriculture filled with beautiful landscape and scenery. As of 1940 it was an unincorporated, with much of its population being of Mexican or Portuguese descent. In 1970, Gardenland Park was built at the end of Bowman Avenue, bringing festivals and sports activities to the community. During the summer the city of Sacramento provided a recreational program that would delight the neighborhood children and supply sack lunches throughout the summer months. Also during the 1970s, sidewalks and a sophisticated drainage system were installed removing the hazardous ditches and flood ways and improving the roads. Lights were installed on all the streets and in and around Gardenland Park. Climate Gardenland has a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild winters and dry, hot summers. The area usually has low humidity. Rain typically falls only between November and March, with the rainy season tapering off almost completely by the end of April. The average temperature throughout the year is 61 °F (16 °C), with the daily average ranging from 46 °F (8 °C) in December and January to 76 °F (24 °C). Average daily high temperatures range from 53 °F (12 °C) in December and January to 93 °F (34 °C) in July (with many days of over 100 F (38 °C) highs). Daily low temperatures range from 38 to 58 °F (3 to 14 °C). The average year has 73 days with a high over 90 °F (32 °C), with the highest temperature on record being 115 °F (46 °C) on July 25, 2006, and 18 days when the low drops below 32 °F (0 °C), with the coldest day on record being December 11, 1932, at 17 °F (-8 °C). Summer 2007, however, could be the hottest ever on record with a possible drought due to winter 2007 being drier than normal. Average yearly precipitation is 17.4 inches (442 mm), with almost no rain during the summer months, to an average rainfall of 3.7 inches (94 mm) in January. It rains, on average, 58 days of the year. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain (6.41 inches or 163 mm). A record 7.24 inches (184 mm) of rain fell on April 20, 1880. On average, 96 days in the year have fog, mostly in the morning (tule fog), primarily in December and January. The fog can get extremely dense, lowering visibility to less than 100 feet (30 m) and making driving conditions hazardous. The record snowfall was recorded on January 4, 1888, at 9 cm (3.5 in). Snowfall is rare in Gardenland (with an elevation of only 52 feet or 16 m above sea level), with a dusting of snow every eight to ten years. People During the 1950s through the early 1980s, Gardenland had the highest population of Mexican-Americans in the city of Sacramento. Most of these Hispanic residents worked for the Southern Pacific Railroad, Campbell Soup Factory, and Blue Diamond Almond Growers. Sacramento is notably diverse racially, ethnically, and by household income. The city also has a notable lack of inter-racial disharmony. In 2002, Time magazine and the Civil Rights Project of Harvard University identified Sacramento as the most racially/ethnically integrated major city in America. The U.S. Census Bureau also groups Sacramento with other U.S. cities having a \\"High Diversity\\" rating of the diversity index.

Generally this is accomplished by connecting the inventory system with order entry and in retail the point of sale system. In this case, book inventory would be exactly the same as, or almost the same, as the real inventory. In earlier periods, non-continuous, or periodic inventory systems were more prevalent. Starting in the 1970s digital computers made possible the ability to implement a perpetual inventory system. This has been facilitated by bar coding and lately radio frequency identification (RFID) labeling which allows computer systems to quickly read and process inventory information as part of transaction processing. Perpetual inventory systems can still be vulnerable to errors due to overstatements (phantom inventory) or understatements (missing inventory) that can occur as a result of theft, breakage, scanning errors or untracked inventory movements, leading to systematic errors in replenishment.A Comprehensive Guide to Retail Out-of- Stock Reduction in the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Industry, Thomas W. Gruen, Ph.D., University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, USA and Dr. Daniel Corsten, IE Business School Madrid. The perpetual inventory formula is very straightforward. Beginning Inventory (usually from a physical count) + receipts - shipments = Ending Inventory. Some accountants will add or subtract a value using an adjustment entry (journal voucher), however if all receipts (purchases) and shipments (invoices) are captured as transactions, this would never need to occur.

In the 2000 Ghanaian general elections, he was chosen over Samuel Mcneil Nimo of the National Democratic Congress. Other opponents included Joseph Obeng of the National Reform Party, Samuel Effah Krofah of the People's National Convention and Yaw Oti-Dankese of the Convention People's Party. He polled 14,499 votes of the total valid votes cast. This is equivalent to 73.00%. Mr. Nimo had 4,286, Joseph had 621,Effah Krofah had 272 and Oti-Dankese had 178.

Julien also appeared in Def Jam's How to Be a Player and has guest starred on TV shows such as The Mod Squad, The Bold Ones: The Protectors, and One on One. He began his career on the stage in New York's Off-Broadway circuit including Joseph Papp's Shakespeare-In-The-Park. Moving westward to Hollywood, he landed co-starring roles with Jack Nicholson in Psych-Out and Candice Bergen in Columbia's box-office hit film Getting Straight. While spending time in Rome, Italy, he wrote and directed a documentary called Trestevre, then wrote the screenplay for, and subsequently co-produced, Warner Brothers's blaxploitation classic Cleopatra Jones, which starred actress Tamara Dobson in the title role as a narcotics agent who was as skilled in martial arts as she was with firearms. Julien refused to participate in the sequel, Cleopatra Jones and the Casino of Gold, which led to his being credited instead with the film's story and script both being \\"based on characters created by Max Julien\\". Critics For his performance in 1968's Up Tight!, New York Times movie critic Judith Crist stated that Julien was \\"a standout in a standout cast.\\" Raoul Gripenwaldt from the Santa Monica Evening Outlook once wrote: \\"Max Julien's portrayal of Johnny Wells in Paramount's Uptight could very well result in an Academy Award.\\" The Hollywood Reporter chimed in: \\"Max Julien creates a memorable piece of reality.\\" As a reward he was invited to Europe to discuss film possibilities.

Pleconaril, administered either orally or intranasally, is active against viruses in the Picornaviridae family, including Enterovirus and Rhinovirus. It has shown useful activity against the dangerous enterovirus D68. History Pleconaril was originally developed by Sanofi-Aventis, and licensed to ViroPharma in 1997. ViroPharma developed it further, and submitted a New Drug Application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. The application was rejected, citing safety concerns; and ViroPharma re-licensed it to Schering- Plough in 2003. The Phase II clinical trial was completed in 2007. A pleconaril intranasal spray had reached phase II clinical trial for the treatment of the common cold symptoms and asthma complications. However, the results have yet to be reported. Mechanism of action In enteroviruses, Pleconaril prevents the virus from exposing its RNA, and in rhinoviruses Pleconaril prevents the virus from attaching itself to the host cell. Free full text with registration Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) contain four structural proteins labeled VP1-VP4. Proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 are eight stranded anti- parallel β-barrels. VP4 is an extended polypeptide chain on the viral capsid inner surface. Pleconaril binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the VP1 protein. Pleconaril has been shown in viral assembly to associate with viral particles. Through noncovalent, hydrophobic interactions compounds can bind to the hydrophobic pocket. Amino acids in positions Tyr152 and Val191 are a part of the VP1 drug binding pocket. This Image was created in JMOL showing the beta sheets and alpha helices of the Human Rhinovirus. The molecule embedded in the hydrophobic pocket of the VP1 protein is Pleconaril In Coxsackievirus, Pleconaril efficiency correlates to the susceptibility of CVB3 with the amino acid at position 1092 in the hydrophobic pocket. Amino acid 1092 is in close proximity to the central ring of capsid binders. The binding of pleconaril in the hydrophobic pocket creates conformational changes, which increases the rigidity of the virion and decreases the virions' ability to interact with its receptor. Drugs bind with the methylisoxazole ring close to the entrance pocket in VP1, the 3-fluromethyl oxadiazole ring at the end of the pocket and the phenyl ring in the center of the pocket. Clinical trials The results of two randomized, double blind, placebo studies found Pleconaril treatment could benefit patients suffering from colds due to picornaviruses. Participants in the studies were healthy adults from Canada and the United States, with self-diagnosed colds that had occurred within 24 hours of trial enrollment. Participants were randomly given a placebo or two 200 mg tablets to take three times daily for five days. To increase absorption it was recommended to be taken after a meal. To monitor the effectiveness of Pleconaril, participants recorded the severity of their symptoms and nasal mucosal samples were obtained at enrollment, day 3, day 6 and day 18. The two studies had a total of 2096 participants and more than 90% (1945) completed the trial. The most common reason for a participant not finishing the trial was an adverse event. Pleconaril treatment showed a reduction in nose blowing, sleep disturbance, and less cold medication used. Another study showed over 87% of virus isolates in cell culture were inhibited by pleconaril. Virus variants were detected in 0.7% of the placebo group and 10.7% of the pleconaril group. Of the two isolates a subject from the placebo group had a resistant virus in cell culture to pleconaril. The other strain was susceptible to the drug. The pleconaril group had 21 virus strains, which remained susceptible. Resistance strains were found in 7 pleconaril patients. A Phase II study that used an intranasal formulation of pleconaril failed to show a statistically significant result for either of its two primary efficacy endpoints, percentage of participants with rhinovirus PCR-positive colds and percentage of participants with asthma exacerbations together with rhinovirus- positive PCR.National Institutes of Health. Effects of Pleconaril Nasal Spray on Common Cold Symptoms and Asthma Exacerbations Following Rhinovirus Exposure (Study P04295AM2). Clinical Trials.gov. Available at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00394914. Accessed: July 20, 2015 Resistance In human rhinoviruses mutations in amino acids at positions 152 and 191 decrease the efficiency of pleconaril. The resistant HRV have phenylalanine at position 152 and leucine at position 191. In vitro studies have shown resistance to pleconaril may emerge. The wild type resistance frequency to pleconaril was about 5×10−5. Coxsackievirus B3(CVB3) strain Nancy and other mutants carry amino acid substitutions at position 1092 of Ile1092->Leu1092 or Ile1092->Met in VP1. The Ile->Leu mutation causes complete resistance to pleconaril. The study found resistance of CVB3 to pleconaril can be overcome by substitution of the central phenyl group. Methyl and bromine substitutions created an increase of pleconaril activity towards sensitive and resistant strains. Amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic pocket and receptor binding region of viral capsid proteins were shown to have an effect against the sensitivity of capsid binding antivirals. Side effects of pleconaril The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejected pleconaril in 2002 due to the side effects. The most commonly reported side effects were mild to moderate headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Some women were having symptoms of spotting in between periods. Menstrual irregularities were reported by 3.5% of the 320 pleconaril treated women using oral contraceptives and by none of the 291 placebo treated women. In the clinical trial two women became pregnant due to the drug interfering with hormonal birth control. Other patients have described painful nasal inflammation. Another side effect of the Pleconaril drug trials was activation of cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes.

It contains 180 drawings of First Nations' people, plants, mammals, birds and fish of the New World. Although the manuscript was neither signed nor dated, scholars believe its most likely author was Louis Nicolas, a French Jesuit. It is currently kept at the Gilcrease Museum, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Author When a facsimile of the Codex was produced in 1934, a foreword by Baron Marc de Villiers attributed the original work to Bécart de Granville. Scholars have more recently discovered that the author was probably Nicolas. The Histoire Naturelle des Indes Occidentales, a document held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, is speculated to have also been written by Nicolas and provides an in depth description of the animals, fish and plants of Canada, which are all depicted in the Codex Canadensis. The author of the Histoire Naturelle also mentions that the descriptions of his observations are accompanied by illustrations: . The author of the latter document signed his work M.L.N.P, which recalls the initials of the Grammaire Algonquine 's author, Louis Nicolas. Furthermore, in the Grammaire 's preface, the author specifies that he has placed at the end of his book an extra section on the history of the country: \\"\\". The Codex Canadensis and Histoire Naturelle des Indes Occidentales could easily be the supplement Louis Nicolas refers too. Indeed, the similarities between the Codex Canadensis, the Histoire Naturelle and the Grammaire Algonquine make it reasonable to believe that all three documents were written by the same man, Louis Nicolas, Priest and Missionary. = Louis Nicolas = Louis Nicolas was born in 1634 in Ardèche, France. He joined the Jesuits at age 20. In 1664, he arrived in New France, where his order was sent to convert the Aboriginal peoples. As he travelled, his interest in Aboriginal languages and culture increased. Nonetheless, he did not always behave accordingly towards the native peoples. He could be \\"quick-tempered and rather vain\\". In 1675, he returned to France.  Cartography  Codex canadensis: inside back cover. (Gilcrease Museum) Apart from its depictions of plants, animals, and native peoples, the Codex Canadensis also includes two maps. The inside front cover of the tome contains a map of the Mississippi River and its environs, while the inside back cover contains a map of northeastern North America, including territories such as New France and Acadia, as well as New England, New York, Newfoundland and the region of the Great Lakes. Hence, both of the maps depict French colonial spaces in North America. Both maps contain quite a large amount of detail when it comes to labeling settlements, particularly in coastal areas and along rivers. This is consistent with European cartography of the Americas in the early modern period. The detailed depictions of coastal and fluvial settlements was important due to the importance ships had in the transportation systems of the time, particularly in the New World. Furthermore, the mapping of settlements as can be seen in the Codex Canadensis, and cartography in general, played an important role in the imperial endeavours of European powers in this period. In that sense, the maps in the Codex can be seen as part of the wider context of cartography as a colonial tool, a way of asserting control over certain spaces.  First Nations peoples  The presentation of Native (Indian) communities in the Codex Canadensis is a veritable compendium of different aspects of indigenous life. The sketches represent many different communities, from Algonquin to Iroquois to Outawaks and so on, and document the varying lifestyle between the communities. One page details the different types of canoe dependent on community, and there is another page similarly devoted to different types of cabins. The inclusion of mythology through the various representations of Natives and their interaction with the sun or moon additionally adds to the full picture that composed Native life. This ethnographic pictorial study of these communities provides a more literal depiction of these communities as other similar studies of the time, such as that of DuCreux, were less observant of the ornamentation of bodies such as tattoos, which Louis Nicolas takes much care to draw in detail. The captions describe the native peoples as or , implying the subordination of these communities to the arrival of Europeans in the New World. This is subordination, not racial degeneration, as contemporary French ideas of the time were formed about the unity of all humankind; therefore the Native societies were believed to be less civilised than their French contemporaries, seen with their use of language. The equation of Natives with the New World's flora and fauna in the Codex Canadensis further shows this subordination.  Plants  The Codex Canadensis features four plates with drawings of 18 different plant species, most of which are native to Canada. Art historian Francois-Marc Gagnon concluded that the images were likely not copied from books, but that it is impossible to determine whether or not the drawings were produced in Canada. Possible connections between the drawings of the Codex and gardens in France have been established, as gardens were a choice place to observe plants at the time. Canadian plants ended up in these gardens in France, the white cedar grown in the Jardin des Tuileries, a drawing of which can be found in the Codex. These connections make it possible that Nicolas produced his drawings both during his expeditions in Canada as well as in France, inspired by plants cultivated in French gardens. However, Nicolas' method was common for that time period and does not lessen the value of the images. Though Louis Nicolas underwent the rigorous education associated with the Jesuit religious order, he never had any formal training in botanical illustration. Some of the plants are poorly represented, and have proven to be difficult to identify, the illustrations generally lacking consistency in their representations of plant anatomy. In a pre-Linnaean scientific world, Nicolas used Aristotelian explanatory framework to relate his accumulating observations about plants to the authority of religion-tinged ancient knowledge. Additionally, there does not appear to be any explicit criteria for the classification of the plants in the Codex, but it can be deduced that the author ordered them by size, starting from smaller herbs, to fruits and then trees. The Codex features some plants that are not indigenous to Canada, for example the passion flower, named the by Nicolas. The caption for this particular illustration in the document reads 'qui produit les instruments de la passion'. Nicolas' representation of the passion flower shows the religious interpretation of the flower's anatomy, with parts of the flower representing various aspects of the passion of Christ. This flower is indigenous to South America, and is likely in the Codex as a curiosity, as it was popular among 16th- and 17th-century illustrators. The explicitly religious symbols incorporated into the drawing of the passion flower is another example of the various fictional creatures and marvels present in the Codex.  Animals  An additional constituent to the Codex is devoted to the wildlife of the French colony. Louis Nicolas subdivides the volume into three distinct segments with regard to the living animals, their visual description and illustrations. He begins his description of New France's wildlife with the many birds he encountered along his journey through the newly colonized land. These illustrations include that of game birds, owls, and pigeons to name a few, with short and concise visual descriptions alongside the hand drawings. He continues his accounts of the diverse North American wildlife with a wide array of fish. In fact, he dedicates fourteen pages of the Codex to these aquatic creatures, from goldfish, to trout, and from halibut to cod. Keeping in mind that cod was incredibly lucrative at this time for the French empire, playing a major role within the French economy, it comes as no surprise that Louis Nicolas illustrated the fish with great enthusiasm. He also gives a visual description of the numerous living quadrupeds roaming around the land. He mentions many of the animals regularly encountered today such as squirrels, mice, rabbits and deer. Louis Nicolas further orients himself towards the realm of the fanciful. In terms of visual representations, he provides his public with creatures like the (sea monster) and (unicorn of the Red Sea). Sketches of these beasts are also bestowed. Convinced that these magical beasts did in fact exist, he relied on ancient Greek literature to cement his claims. Other wildlife is also incorporated into this large volume, such as reptiles and small insects, though they do not take precedence in comparison to the first three types of species previously mentioned.

Young's work, often a blend of collage and painting, utilizes found objects and the experience of African Americans in the south. Young gained recognition as a cult contemporary artist, with a collectors' following including Jane Fonda, Damon Wayans, Jim Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, and others. In 2006 a feature documentary titled Purvis of Overtown was produced about his life and work. His work is found in the collections of the American Folk Art Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the High Museum of Art, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and others. In 2018, he was inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame.http://dos.myflorida.com/cultural/programs/florida-artists-hall-of- fame/purvis-young/ Early life and work Purvis Young was born in Liberty City, a neighborhood of Miami, Florida, on February 2, 1943. As a young boy, his uncle introduced him to drawing, but Young lost interest quickly. He never attended high school. As a teenager, Young served three years (1961–64) in prison at North Florida's Raiford State Penitentiary for breaking and entering. While in prison he would regain his interest in art and began drawing and studying art books. When released, he began to produce thousands of small drawings, which he kept in shopping carts and later glued into discarded books and magazines that he found on the streets.Arnett, 388. He proceeded to move into the Overtown neighborhood of Miami.Arnett, 389. Young became attracted to a vacant alley called Goodbread Alley, which was named after the Jamaican bakeries that once occupied the street; he started living there in 1971.Arnett, 392. Mid-career In the early 1970s, Young found inspiration in the mural movements of Chicago and Detroit, and decided to create a mural of inspiration Overtown.Arnett, 390. He had never painted before, but inspiration struck and he began to create paintings and nailing them to the boarded up storefronts that formed the alley. He painted on wood he found on the streets and occasionally paintings would \\"disappear\\" from the wall, but Young didn't mind. About two years after starting the mural, tourists started visiting the alley, mainly white tourists. Occasionally, Young sold paintings to visitors - tourists and collectors alike - right off the wall.Arnett, 393. The mural garnered media attention, including the attention of millionaire Bernard Davis, owner of the Miami Art Museum. Davis became a patron of Young, providing him with painting supplies as well. Davis died in 1973, leaving Young a local celebrity in Miami. Late career and death Untitled by Purvis Young, ca. 1988, in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he explored other inspirations by watching historical documentaries about war, the Great Depression, commerce, and Native American conflicts and struggles in the United States. In 1999 the Rubell family, notable art collectors from New York, purchased the entire content of Young's studio, a collection of almost 3,000 pieces. In 2008 the Rubells donated 108 works to Morehouse College In January 2007, Purvis was selected as the Art Miami Fair's Director's Choice at the Miami Beach Convention Center and helped to establish a number of outdoor art fairs in South Florida that continue today. With artistic success came monetary gain, and Young failed to maintain his estate. Before his death, he became involved in a legal battle with former manager Martin Siskind. Young sued Siskind for mismanagement of funds. In response, Siskind successfully petitioned for Young to be declared mentally incompetent, and Young's affairs were placed in control of legal guardians. According to friends, Young was not incompetent and was left destitute by the procedures. Siskind stated that he and Young had settled the suit amicably and that Young retained ownership of 1,000 paintings and was financially stable. Young suffered from diabetes, and toward the latter years of his life, he had other health problems, undergoing a kidney transplant in 2007. He died on April 20, 2010 in Miami, from cardiac arrest and pulmonary edema. He is survived by his partner Eddie Mae Lovest; his two sisters Betty Rodriguez and Shirley Byrd, brother Irvin Byrd, four stepdaughters, and 13 step-children. In 2015, The Bass Museum of Art announced that it is donating almost 400 pieces of Young's art to the permanent collection in the Black Archives History and Research Foundation of South Florida. The foundation is located in Lyric Theater in Overtown. Work Young found strong influence in Western art history and voraciously absorbed books from his nearby public library by Rembrandt, Vincent van Gogh, Gauguin, El Greco, Daumier and Picasso. His work was vibrant and colorful, and was described as appearing like fingerpainting. Reoccurring themes in his work were angels, wild horses, and urban landscapes. Through his works, he expressed social and racial issues, and served as an outspoken activist about politics and bureaucracy. He is credited with influencing the art movement terms Social Expressionism or Urban Expressionism. In 2016, the records of art collector and dealer Jimmy Hedges and his Rising Fawn Folk Art Gallery were donated to the Smithsonian Archives of American Art on behalf of the Hedges Descendants Trust. Known as The Jimmy Hedges Papers, the file includes artist files, correspondence, photographs, and other materials documenting Hedges's interactions with hundreds of artists, whose homes and studios he visited, including Young.

Construction of the part or assembly is usually done using 3D printing or \\"additive layer manufacturing\\" technology.\\"Interview with Dr Greg Gibbons, Additive Manufacturing, WMG, University of Warwick\\", Warwick University, KnowledgeCentre . Accessed 18 October 2013 The first methods for rapid prototyping became available in the late 1980s and were used to produce models and prototype parts. Today, they are used for a wide range of applications, and are used to manufacture production-quality parts in relatively small numbers if desired without the typical unfavorable short-run economics. This economy has encouraged online service bureaus. Historical surveys of RP technology start with discussions of simulacra production techniques used by 19th-century sculptors. Some modern sculptors use the progeny technology to produce exhibitions and various objects. The ability to reproduce designs from a dataset has given rise to issues of rights, as it is now possible to interpolate volumetric data from one-dimensional images. As with CNC subtractive methods, the computer-aided-design – computer-aided manufacturing CAD -CAM workflow in the traditional rapid prototyping process starts with the creation of geometric data, either as a 3D solid using a CAD workstation, or 2D slices using a scanning device. For rapid prototyping this data must represent a valid geometric model; namely, one whose boundary surfaces enclose a finite volume, contain no holes exposing the interior, and do not fold back on themselves. In other words, the object must have an \\"inside\\". The model is valid if for each point in 3D space the computer can determine uniquely whether that point lies inside, on, or outside the boundary surface of the model. CAD post-processors will approximate the application vendors' internal CAD geometric forms (e.g., B-splines) with a simplified mathematical form, which in turn is expressed in a specified data format which is a common feature in additive manufacturing: STL file format, a de facto standard for transferring solid geometric models to SFF machines. To obtain the necessary motion control trajectories to drive the actual SFF, rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing mechanism, the prepared geometric model is typically sliced into layers, and the slices are scanned into lines (producing a \\"2D drawing\\" used to generate trajectory as in CNC's toolpath), mimicking in reverse the layer-to-layer physical building process.  Application areas  3D production systems allow electric cars to be built and tested in one year.Revolutionary New Electric Car Built and Tested in One Year with Objet1000 Multi-material 3D Production System Rapid prototyping is also commonly applied in software engineering to try out new business models and application architectures such as Aerospace, Automotive, Product development and Healthcare.  History In the 1970s, Joseph Henry Condon and others at Bell Labs developed the Unix Circuit Design System (UCDS), automating the laborious and error-prone task of manually converting drawings to fabricate circuit boards for the purposes of research and development. By the 1980s, U.S. policy makers and industrial managers were forced to take note that America's dominance in the field of machine tool manufacturing evaporated, in what was named the machine tool crisis. Numerous projects sought to counter these trends in the traditional CNC CAM area, which had begun in the US. Later when Rapid Prototyping Systems moved out of labs to be commercialized, it was recognized that developments were already international and U.S. rapid prototyping companies would not have the luxury of letting a lead slip away. The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations. One such report was the 1997 Rapid Prototyping in Europe and Japan Panel Report in which Joseph J. Beamanhistory of laser Additive Manufacturing founder of DTM Corporation [DTM RapidTool pictured] provides a historical perspective: The technologies referred to as Solid Freeform Fabrication are what we recognize today as rapid prototyping, 3D printing or additive manufacturing: Swainson (1977), Schwerzel (1984) worked on polymerization of a photosensitive polymer at the intersection of two computer controlled laser beams. Ciraud (1972) considered magnetostatic or electrostatic deposition with electron beam, laser or plasma for sintered surface cladding. These were all proposed but it is unknown if working machines were built. Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute was the first to publish an account of a solid model fabricated using a photopolymer rapid prototyping system (1981). Even at that early date the technology was seen as having a place in manufacturing practice. A low resolution, low strength output had value in design verification, mould making, production jigs and other areas. Outputs have steadily advanced toward higher specification uses.SME Wolhers/ Innovations are constantly being sought, to improve speed and the ability to cope with mass production applications.Hayes, Jonathan (2002) Concurrent printing and thermographing for rapid manufacturing: executive summary.

It tells the story of Hanna, a girl struggling with her sexuality and the depression of both her parents as she goes through puberty in Quebec in 1963. The film heavily references the French new-wave film Vivre sa vie (It's my life) by Jean-Luc Godard. The film won critical acclaim and several awards, both for Pool and Vanasse, including being named the year's best Canadian feature by the Toronto Film Critics Association. Plot Hanna is living on a farm with her grandparents and mentally handicapped uncle when she gets her first period. The onset of puberty (and her grandmother's relatively non- supportive explanation of it) trigger her decision to return to her parents in Montreal. Returning to the city, Hanna resumes her relationships with her depressive mother, her erratic father and her brother, who is understandably usually absent from home. Hanna's mother, a fashion designer, has put aside all of her artistic dreams in favour of devoting all her time to supporting Hanna's father, an unpublished writer she believes to be a genius. Hanna's father, distant and erratic, gets a job working for a newspaper, but soon quits, and spends all day playing chess in a café while his wife thinks he is at work. Hanna is fascinated with Anna Karina's character in the Jean-Luc Godard film \\"Vivre sa vie\\" and spends much of her time watching the film and practicing mimicking her cool detachment. She also begins to be aware of her sexuality, developing a crush on a female teacher, and kissing another girl, Laura, at a school dance. Hanna's mother attempts suicide, and while she is recovering, Hanna is sent to get a loaf of bread by her father. The baker gropes her; then gives her money. Hanna attempts to set Laura up with Paul; however, it is clear that the inclusion of the boy is a pretense meant to somehow undercut the implications of her attraction to Laura. This culminates in a game of Spin the bottle between the three. Hanna decides to experiment with being a prostitute, like her idol Anna Karina, but at the last moment changes her mind. However, her john refuses to let her back out, and forces himself on her. As the school year ends, Hannah's mother returns to her family, and Hannah finds a new way to express herself and cope with the world using a film camera lent to her by her teacher.

He was later elected a member of Parliament and served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister of the Interior. He was also active in the Macedonian Struggle. The organization Macedonian Committee was formed in 1904 by Stephanos Dragoumis in Athens. 1909 reform government Following the Goudi Revolt by the Military League in 1909, the political processes in Greece were in a state of turmoil. The issue of Cretan annexation and military reforms loomed large. After Kiriakoulis Mavromichalis resigned as Prime Minister in January 1910, Dragoumis was appointed as part of a reform government and the Military League dissolved. At the same time, Eleftherios Venizelos arrived in Athens from Crete. In March, the Greek Parliament decided to convoke a Revisionary Parliament to revise the Greek Constitution. The Dragoumis government responded positively to the demands of its dual mission: to secure a smooth path towards the process of reform and to complete its legislative programme. VenizelosNational Research Foundation By September, Venizelos had arrived in Athens and by drawing large crowds to rallies had established his political strength. King George invited Venizelos to form a government and Dragoumis resigned. Later career A bust in Athens During the Balkan Wars, he served as Governor-General of Crete, and later (June 1913) of Macedonia. During the National Schism, he sided with the anti-Venizelist, royalist faction.

They are best remembered as the producers and photographers of some of the best miniature effects of their time. They both worked at Republic from its creation in 1935 until the company could no longer afford to maintain full-time contract players and behind-the- camera artists in the middle 1950s, after which they went freelance and found themselves in significant demand for both film and television work. Their miniature effects made Republic serials the best for visual effects, far outstripping their competitors at Universal (where special effects maestro John P. Fulton, ASC was forbidden from working on serials) and Columbia Pictures. Their success came from building large, detailed models and filming them in natural light, often in forced perspective to create realistic impressions that they were in fact life-size in relation to other objects and people in a shot, instead of the small models used by others, and the use of slow motion to give the models the appearance of realistic weight when in motion.Howard & Theodore Lydecker: Miniature Effects Geniuses, retrieved 10/04/07 For instance, in The Adventures of Captain Marvel, the visuals of Captain Marvel flying appear to be an actual man in flight, not a matted or superimposed image.

She is best remembered as the long-time host of the popular children's programme The Aunty Kay Show, which aired from 1942 to 1985 on Radio Trinidad every Sunday afternoon. A multi-talented woman, she was during the course of her life a medical student, pianist, singer, actress, dancer, broadcaster and teacher, giving lessons in music and elocution, as well as briefly serving as an alderman of the Port of Spain City Council. A biography of her was being written by Tony Martin.Kenneth J. Cooper, \\"Controversial African studies lecturer retires\\", The Baystate Banner. Early life and acting career Kathleen Davis was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where she went to Trinity Girls School and Bishop Anstey High School, and then in 1919, together with her two older sisters, Meta and Beryl, completed her education in Britain, attending Redland High School, near Bristol, as a boarder.Peter D. Maynard, Great Awakening: Meta Davis Cumberbatch, \\"Mother of the Arts\\", 2010, pp. 155, 174. She went on to study for two years at the School of Medicine for Women, part of London University, but had to discontinue medical studies after the death of her father, and later studied speech and elocution in London.Maynard, Great Awakening (2010), pp. 163, 174. Becoming an actress, she featured alongside Paul Robeson in the London stage production of the play Stevedore, by Paul Peters and George Sklar, which opened at the Embassy Theatre on 9 May 1935, with a cast that included Black actors of American, West Indian, African, and English background. A notice by Nancy Cunard in The Crisis said: \\"Kathleen Davis as 'Ruby' and the Gold Coastian Ahuma as 'Joe Crump' are both beautiful and have great personality.\\"Nancy Cunard, \\"Stevedore in London\\", The Crisis, August 1935, p. 238.Nancy Cunard, \\"Many Types Seen in London Cast of 'Stevedore' – Could Not Find Enough Americans So Africans Are Used\\", The Afro American, 15 June 1935.

The population was 145 at the 2010 census. History The town (but a census- designated place prior to 2016) was platted and constructed beginning in 1957 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation to house workers working on the construction of Flaming Gorge Dam. After the dam's completion in 1964, Dutch John became home to a smaller number of dam maintenance and operations personnel, as well as employees of the National Park Service and United States Forest Service. The Dutch John townsite and its buildings continued to be owned by the Bureau of Reclamation until 1998, when the town was privatized. Buildings were sold to individual landowners, and undeveloped land in the town was transferred to Daggett County. The county later completed a master plan for the Dutch John townsite, and has begun offering parcels of land for sale to developers. In July 2002, the human-caused Mustang Ridge fire burned approximately of pinyon/juniper forest in the immediate vicinity of Dutch John. The fire caused damage to power transmission lines which were supported by wooden poles. During the peak years of construction activity at Flaming Gorge Dam, as many as 3,500 people lived in Dutch John. In the election of November 2014, the residents of Dutch John voted overwhelmingly to incorporate into a town. An election was held in June 2015, in which William Rogers was elected mayor; Ryan Kelly, Sandy Kunkel, Harriet Dickerson, and Dave MacDonald were elected as members of the Town Council. They took office, and incorporation became official in January 2016.http://www.ubmedia.biz/vernal/news/article_042c315a-7f2a-11e4-afcc-0ff27c88a0a2.html Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 145 people living in the CDP. There were 105 housing units. The racial makeup of the town was 97.2% White, 0.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.4% Asian, and 0.7% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.4% of the population.

ASHA uses tools such as education, communication, advocacy and policy analysis activities with the intent to heighten public, patient, provider, policymaker and media awareness of STI prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment strategies. History In 1913, at a conference in Buffalo, New York, with the advice of John D. Rockefeller Jr., two social hygiene associations, the American Vigilance Association and the American Federation for Sex Hygiene, dedicated to fighting prostitution and venereal disease, joined to form the American Social Hygiene Association. In 1914, ASHA established its national headquarters in New York City. Founders and supporters included Charles Eliot, president of Harvard University; Jane Addams of Chicago's Hull House; Edward Keyes, Jr., M.D.; Dr. Thomas N. Hepburn, leader of the Connecticut social hygiene movement; Grace Dodge, philanthropist; John D. Rockefeller, Jr., initial financial contributor; and Dr. William Freeman Snow, Stanford University professor and secretary of the California State Board of Health. =World War I= ASHA's early worked focused on education and awareness efforts within the armed forces. ASHA worked with the US War Department during World War I when VD occurrences surged among soldiers. Their efforts included educating soldiers about venereal diseases and their transmission and attempting to eliminate prostitution, which was believed to be the primary vehicle for VD transmission among the armed forces. ASHA was successful in shutting down many of the prostitution rings that traditionally surrounded military bases. Due to its contribution to the war effort, ASHA gained national attention and succeeded in creating public awareness of VD. =Between the wars= During the 1920s, ASHA served as a central coordinator for the local or regional committees, doctors, public health officials, and social welfare agencies that were combating sexually transmitted infections. In addition, ASHA published the Journal of Social Hygiene and the Social Hygiene Bulletin, conducted studies on the prevalence of syphilis, undertook surveys on VD, published synopsis of laws concerning prostitution, and supported legislation that required a premarital exam for syphilis. The program also promoted character and sex education as a means of preventing the spread of STIs. The ASHA educational program emphasized preparation for a wholesome family life, avoiding VD, and physical as well as moral fitness. ASHA had developed into a mature organization by the 1930s with an effective network of supporting local organizations. ASHA also was involved in cooperative projects with a variety of organizations. In a single year, ASHA collaborated with the Federal Council of Churches and the National Congress of Parents and Teachers to promote sex education programs and materials; provided leadership for efforts by the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection to consider the social hygiene elements of child health; conducted institutes for public health nurses under the auspices of the National Organization of Public Health Nursing; and provided data to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs in preparation for Indian Health Programs. =World War II= American Social Health Association World War II poster During World War II, ASHA fulfilled a role reminiscent of its work during World War I, serving on the VD Coordinating Committee for the US military and working against prostitution. ASHA's efforts contributed to a 50% drop in VD infection rates in the military during the first years of the war. In 1944, the military began using penicillin as a cure for syphilis and by the late 1950s it was believed that syphilis was no longer a serious health threat. As a result, the Journal of Social Hygiene discontinued publication. =Kinsey era= The release of the Kinsey reports on sexual behavior in 1948 and 1954 created national controversy. ASHA played a prominent role in the debate, organizing a national conference to bring together leading authorities in the fields of psychology, statistics, education, medicine, law, religion, anthropology and sociology to exchange views as to the significance of Kinsey's new information. The goal was to look at the information as scientific data instead of pornography. As Walter Clark, ASHA president from 1937 to 1951, commented, \\"The truth never harms . . . And it seems reasonable to hope that when today's older generation, conditioned against frankness in sex matters, passes away and today's youth takes over tomorrow's world, the truth about sex shall indeed make them free—free of the diseases, the exploitations, the ignorance and superstitions which for ages have burdened and blighted society.\\" Also in the 1950s, ASHA began to distribute a comprehensive annual questionnaire to health officers across the country. The responses, tabulated by ASHA and analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were published annually as Today's VD Control Problem, continuing under ASHA auspices until 1975. Today's VD Control Problem provided the statistical basis for testimony before Congress, as ASHA returned year after year to urge adequate federal appropriations for STD control. =The 1960s and 1970s= As ASHA began to recognize that the STD issue connected with other issues, it reflected its broader approach in a name change, moving from American Social Hygiene Association to American Social Health Association in 1960. Among the issues of concern identified by ASHA was the link between STDs and drug use. In 1961 ASHA launched a new program that was the first to focus on the prevention of narcotic addiction and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicts. The agency evaluated existing programs, issued position papers and informational booklets, maintained a clearinghouse, and sponsored four community-based pilot projects. By the 1970s, though, additional novel problems led to soaring STD rates, including the sexual revolution, more international travel, gay liberation, birth control for women, and increasing drug use. Scientists were also recognizing more sexually transmitted pathogens, and viral STDs were making an appearance as well, from herpes simplex virus (HSV) to human papilloma virus (HPV). ASHA's public outreach efforts in this era included the creation of the Herpes Resource Center in 1979, the first program in the U.S. for people living with a viral STD. ASHA also established the National VD Hotline, where trained volunteers offers scientifically accurate information and support. ASHA also launched its first modern public awareness campaign, VD is For Everybody.https://www.youtube.com/user/ashastd#p/u/2/SN9_J3_9wPc Working with the National Advertising Council, ASHA called attention to the alarming increase in the number of STDs by means of radio, television, and print public service announcements. During the 1980s, ASHA continued to educate the public about sexually transmitted infections, primarily by means of telephone information and referral hot-lines, such as the National STD Hotline and the National AIDS Hotline. ASHA established the latter hotline in 1986, at that time the largest health-related hotline in the world. By the 1990s, the hotline was answering more than 1.5 million calls per year. The association also continued to advocate for public policies to combat STDS and increased funding for research. The identification of the AIDS virus added a new area of concern to the association's fight against sexually transmitted infections. ASHA Today ASHA continues its mission to improve the health of improving the health of individuals, families and communities with a focus on preventing sexually transmitted diseases and their harmful consequences, and has broadened its efforts into the field of sexual health. Its current programs include: STI Resource Center, that provides information, materials and referrals to the public who have questions or concerns about sexually transmitted infections. Through its telephone hotline and online message boards, the Center answers questions on such topics as transmission, risk reduction, prevention, testing, and treatment and partner communication. Herpes Resource Center, founded in 1979, continues to provide information and support through its multiple web pages, message board and publications. The center also offers The Helper, a quarterly journal that discusses the latest in herpes information, research, treatment, testing and patient-advocacy. HPV and Cervical Cancer Prevention Resource Center, established in 1991, offers information and referrals about the Human Papillomavirus to patients, health care providers, and policy makers. The HPV Resource Center focuses on issues including HPV vaccines, partner communication and cervical cancer screening. The Center also offers a bimonthly electronic journal, HPV News, that covers the latest in HPV research, treatment and testing options, and policy issues. ASHA's Research division conducts numerous research projects among local, regional, and national constituents focusing on a variety of populations and an assortment of health topics including sexually transmitted infections. ASHA's Washington staff works to educate members of Congress and other important voices in health policy about the urgency of research and frontline programs in the STI field. Advocacy: ASHA has maintained a policy office in Washington, DC and has worked in partnership with other organizations in the area of sexual and reproductive health to advocate for proper attention and funding to STD research and programs. National Cervical Cancer Coalition: NCCC became an ASHA program in the fall of 2011.

Generally, the goal of a navigation function is to create feasible, safe paths that avoid obstacles while allowing a robot to move from its starting configuration to its goal configuration.  Potential functions as navigation functions  A potential function. Imagine dropping a marble on the surface. It will avoid the three obstacles and eventually reach the goal position in the center. Potential functions assume that the environment or work space is known. Obstacles are assigned a high potential value, and the goal position is assigned a low potential. To reach the goal position, a robot only needs to follow the negative gradient of the surface. We can formalize this concept mathematically as following: Let X be the state space of all possible configurations of a robot. Let X_g \\\\subset X denote the goal region of the state space. Then a potential function \\\\phi(x) is called a (feasible) navigation function if Lavalle, Steven, Planning Algorithms Chapter 8 #\\\\phi(x)=0\\\\ \\\\forall x \\\\in X_g # \\\\phi(x) = \\\\infty if and only if no point in {X_{g}} is reachable from x. #For every reachable state, x \\\\in X \\\\setminus {X_{g}}, the local operator produces a state x' for which \\\\phi(x') < \\\\phi(x).  Probabilistic navigation function  Probabilistic navigation function is an extension of the classical navigation function for static stochastic scenarios. The function is defined by permitted collision probability, which limits the risk during motion. The Minkowski sum used for in the classical definition is replaced with a convolution of the geometries and the Probability Density Functionss of locations. Denoting the target position by x_d, the Probabilistic navigation function is defined as: {\\\\varphi}(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_d (x)}{}} where K is a predefined constant like in the classical navigation function, which ensures the Morse nature of the function. \\\\gamma_d(x) is the distance to the target position {{x - {x_d}{^2}}} , and \\\\beta \\\\left( x \\\\right) takes into account all obstacles, defined as \\\\beta \\\\left( x \\\\right) = \\\\prod\\\\limits_{i = 0}^{{N_{o}}} {{\\\\beta _i}\\\\left( x \\\\right)} where \\\\beta _i(x) is based on the probability for a collision at location x. The probability for a collision is limited by a predetermined value \\\\Delta, meaning: \\\\beta _i (x) = \\\\Delta- p^i\\\\left( x \\\\right) and, \\\\beta _0 (x)= - \\\\Delta + p^0\\\\left( x \\\\right) where p^i(x) is the probability to collide with the i-th obstacle. A map \\\\varphi is said to be a probabilistic navigation function if it satisfies the following conditions: # It is a navigation function. # The probability for a collision is bounded by a predefined probability \\\\Delta.  Navigation Function in Optimal Control  While for certain applications, it suffices to have a feasible navigation function, in many cases it is desirable to have an optimal navigation function with respect to a given cost functional J. Formalized as an optimal control problem, we can write :\\\\text{minimize } J(x_{1:T},u_{1:T})=\\\\int\\\\limits_T L(x_t,u_t,t) dt :\\\\text{subject to } \\\\dot{x_t} = f(x_t,u_t) whereby x is the state, u is the control to apply, L is a cost at a certain state x if we apply a control u, and f models the transition dynamics of the system. Applying Bellman's principle of optimality the optimal cost-to-go function is defined as \\\\displaystyle \\\\phi(x_t) = \\\\min_{u_t \\\\in U(x_t)} \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ L(x_t,u_t) + \\\\phi(f(x_t,u_t)) \\\\Big\\\\\\\\} Together with the above defined axioms we can define the optimal navigation function as #\\\\phi(x)=0\\\\ \\\\forall x \\\\in X_g # \\\\phi(x) = \\\\infty if and only if no point in {X_{G}} is reachable from x. #For every reachable state, x \\\\in X \\\\setminus {X_{G}}, the local operator produces a state x' for which \\\\phi(x') < \\\\phi(x). #\\\\displaystyle \\\\phi(x_t) = \\\\min_{u_t \\\\in U(x_t)} \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ L(x_t,u_t) + \\\\phi(f(x_t,u_t)) \\\\Big\\\\\\\\}  Stochastic Navigation Function  If we assume the transition dynamics of the system or the cost function as subjected to noise, we obtain a stochastic optimal control problem with a cost J(x_t,u_t) and dynamics f. In the field of reinforcement learning the cost is replaced by a reward function R(x_t,u_t) and the dynamics by the transition probabilities P(x_{t+1}x_t,u_t).

There has been some confusion over how exactly she should be referred to. She adopted the diminutive \\"Nelly\\" for her professional society portrait work, and its genitive, \\"Nelly's\\", was incorporated in her decorative studio stamp, but at no time did she refer to herself as Nelly's; that version of her name was popularised by newspapers at the time of her rediscovery in the 1980s. She is now increasingly referred to, more correctly, as \\"Elli Seraidari\\". Biography She was born in Aidini (now Aydın), near Smyrna (now İzmir), Asia Minor. She went to study photography in Germany under Hugo Erfurth and Franz Fiedler, in 1920-1921, before the 1922 expulsion of the ethnic Greeks of Asia Minor by the Turks following the Greco- Turkish war (1919-1922). In 1924, she came to Greece, where she adopted a naive nationalistic and conservative approach to her work. Her style coincided with the Greek state's need to produce an ideal view of the country and its people, for internal as well as external (tourism) purposes. In this respect Souyioultzoglou-Seraidari can be seen as the first Greek \\"national\\" advertiser, especially after her appointment as official photographer of the newly established Greek Ministry of Tourism. At some point she was referred to as \\"the Greek Leni Riefenstahl\\" because of her collaboration with the 4th of August Regime (1936-1941), of which she was one of its most prolific photographers. In 1936, she photographed the Berlin Olympic Games. In 1939, she was commissioned with the decoration of the interior of the Greek pavilion at the New York's World Fair, which she did with gigantic collages expressing in an extremely selective manner the physical similarities between ancient and modern Greeks. As a Greek of the Diaspora, Nelly's view of Greece was nothing less than \\"idyllic\\", which matched the propaganda aims of the proto-fascist regime, led by General Ioannis Metaxas. In fact, her work helped illustrate the ideologeme of the racial continuity of the Greeks since Antiquity, which was at the core of Metaxas' agenda (the so-called \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\" mostly, if not entirely fashioned after Nazi Germany's Third Reich). While at New York for the World's Fair in 1939, she decided not to return to Greece. In the United States she continued her commercial photographic portraiture and developed further in advertising photography as well as photo-reportages. She also maintained links with powerful Greeks including shipowners Stavros Niarchos and Aristotle Onassis and developed contacts with the White House. From this period little is known of her work, except from her project \\"New York Easter Parade\\"http://www.art- athina.gr/2013/ad/http://silezukuk.tumblr.com/post/47644623780 which in retrospective views of her work goes largely unmentioned, as it fails to align with either any previous Greek stereotype or with the continuous developments in the photographic language of her contemporaries. Returning to Greece and death She returned to Greece on 2 March 1966 and lived, together with her husband Angelos Seraidaris, at Nea Smyrni, Attica, and gave up photography. In 1985, Nelly's donated her photo archives and cameras to the Benaki Museum in Athens, while in 1987 she was presented with an honorary diploma and medal by the Hellenic Centre of Photography and the government. In 1993, she was awarded the Order of the Phoenix by the president of the Greek Republic. In 1996, the Athens Academy presented her with its Arts and Letters Award. Nelly's died in Nea Smyrni, Athens in 1998.

Clascal was the inspiration for Object Pascal on the Apple Macintosh in 1985. With the demise of the Lisa in 1986, Pascal and Object Pascal continued to be used in the Macintosh Programmer's Workshop for systems and application development for several more years, until it was finally supplanted by the languages C and C++.

Biography Sneedorff was born in Sorø, the son of the last headmaster of Sorø Academy. He studied at University of Copenhagen and University of Göttingen where he was influenced by British and French Enlightenment thinking as well as German cameralism. From his position as professor at the Sorø Academy for young noblemen and later teacher to the prince, Sneedorff played a key role in formulating the political content of \\"Enlightenment\\" in his native Denmark.  Political views  Sneedorff defended absolutism in a model that applied liberal thinking, primarily that of Locke and Montesquieu. A wellfunctioning polity rested according to Sneedorff on its \\"police\\", i.e. a subject and regent mentality of civic virtue, “true honour\\" and religion. Civic virtue was associated with patriotism. To Sneedorff it meant industrious conduct and the will and desire to let self-interest yield to the common good. True honour had the same end, but operated through exploiting people’s self-interest by connecting social status to conduct that promoted the common good. In Sneedorff's conception, each of the four estates, nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie, and peasantry had their own honour that resembled four different kinds of patriotic behaviour. Should all others fail, Sneedorff reserved religion as the last bond of social order. In general, it was Sneedorff’s view that passions like self-interest should not be subdued, but sublimated into forms that are useful to the state. Instilling the right mentality in subjects thus became a vital political undertaking, a task that made the art of government a pedagogic discipline - a project of Enlightenment. Sneedorff considered the polity he outlined far from the one experienced in his native state of Denmark-Norway. He coined his educational method “the spirit of Socrates”, which implies making people “fall in love” with virtue. Virtue should become a passion itself in order to unite duty-loving subjects and government in emotional harmony. Sneedorff’s absolutist project of enlightenment excluded everyone but the regent from formal political influence. It nevertheless placed enlighteners like Sneedorff himself in a privileged position as those in power to define the contents of virtue and honourable selfmanagement. His enlightenment attitudes also illustrate the mentality behind the centralising reform policy pursued by the absolutist government of his country.

It is a reserve artillery battery, currently under command of the 38 Canadian Brigade Group Artillery Tactical Group, and a component of 10th Field Artillery Regiment, RCA. Lineage The 64th Field Battery traces its ancestry back to the 1920 reorganizations of the Militia and the creation of The Yorkton Regiment on 15 May 1924.regiments.org During the 1936 reorganizations, The Yorkton Regiment was redesignated the 64th (Yorkton) Field Battery of the Royal Canadian Artillery on 15 December 1936. History The 64th (Yorkton) Field Battery did not mobilize for the Second World War initially. In 1941, an active service unit was raised, which saw service with the 6th Canadian Infantry Division on the west coast. The battery later travelled to the United Kingdom, where it was broken up for reinforcements. Concurrently, a reserve battery continued its part-time service in Saskatchewan. Both batteries bore the designation \\"64th (Yorkton)\\". After the Second World War, the battery was briefly designated as a heavy anti-aircraft battery, before converting back to field artillery in the mid-1950s. Originally a sub-unit of the 53rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA, the battery was reassigned to the 10th Field Regiment in 1968. Yorkton Armoury Yorkton Armoury Early in the twentieth century, Yorkton men who had served in the Boer Wars of the 1880s and 1890s began planning for the establishment of a local militia. They approached Dr. E. L. Cash, Federal Member of Parliament for the constituency in hopes that he could influence the Dominion Government to erect military headquarters in Yorkton. With his influence, and the added encouragement of both the Board of Trade and the Town Council, authorization to organize was granted. One veteran of the last of the Boer Wars, Major Francis Pawlett was appointed officer in command of \\"B\\" Squadron, 16th Light Horse, and recruiting began. It was decided to renovate the former Immigration Hall located across the railroad tracks, on Front Street South, between Tupper and Second Avenue. It housed 75 men and was equipped as a training centre. The drills consisted of both foot and mounted exercises. As it happened, not long after they were organized, the First World War was declared. Sixty men of \\"B\\" Squadron headed for more training at one of Canada's largest camps at Valcartier, Quebec. The local armoury kept on being used as a recruiting centre and for basic training. In 1920, when Yorkton's courthouse was constructed on Darlington Street, the courthouse on Livingstone became the second site for the Armoury. By 1922, it was outfitted for all units of Yorkton's militia, with officers' rooms, other ranks' rooms, drill hall, recreation centre, gymnasium, and a rifle range in the basement. Beginning around 1929, local politicians began lobbying for a new building for the 64 (Yorkton) Field Battery, the First Yorkton Anti-Aircraft Machine Gun Battery, and the 16th Canadian Light Horse, which had been amalgamated with the Saskatchewan Mounted Rifles. The old building was inadequate, and so was the Highways warehouse that was being used for extra manoeuvres. With the help of the Federal Member of Parliament, George W. McPhee, they began plans for a new building. It took several more years before the project could be completed. The original designs called for the main entrance to be facing south on Smith Street. By October 1938, the final plans were out. The architect was David Webster and the builder, Shoquist Construction Company, both from Saskatoon. The two-storey building, with the façade on First Avenue North was constructed of brick and Tyndal stone. Subcontracts went to local businesses: Plumber, E. H. Carter, Beck's Electric, and MacKay's Paint Shop. The total cost amounted to $32,000. The official opening took place in October 1939, one month after World War II was declared. Because of new security concerns, a ball planned for the occasion was cancelled. Only one person at a time, accompanied by a soldier could visit the premises. Large-scale recruitment began. The main training took place at Regina and other camps. It did not take long for the soldiers to be sent to England for further mobilization. Current service The battery currently operates as part of the 38 Canadian Brigade Group's Artillery Tactical Group (ATG) and operates the C3 105 mm howitzer. The armoury today houses the Reserve unit of the 64th Battery of the 10th Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery. The building is utilized for the general operation of the unit, with offices, a drill hall where simulated artillery training takes place, and a few classrooms. It is the home of the 2834 Army Cadet Corps, as well. There is a lounge, with a fireplace for social events. No military weaponry is on exhibit, save for General Alexander Ross' sword, and a pair of pikes from the 16th Light Horse. One full-time staff is in charge of the administration and training.

He has personally labeled his political philosophy traditionalism. Bill O'Reilly Calls Himself T-Warrior The O'Reilly Factor, since its inception on the Fox News Channel in 1996, has been the primary outlet of his opinions. O'Reilly started his own radio program, The Radio Factor, a few years later. He has also written several non-fiction books detailing some of his beliefs. O'Reilly generally leans to the right on most issues, most notably the Bush administration's War on Terror, but breaks from the conservative and Republican majority on such issues as the global warming controversy, gun control, gay marriage and the death penalty.  Political views  = Political affiliation = On The O'Reilly Factor and on his former talk-radio program, Bill O'Reilly has focused on news and commentary related to politics and culture. O'Reilly has long said that he does not identify with any political ideology, writing in his book The O'Reilly Factor that the reader \\"might be wondering if whether I'm conservative, liberal, libertarian, or exactly what.... See, I don't want to fit any of those labels, because I believe that the truth doesn't have labels. When I see corruption, I try to expose it. When I see exploitation, I try to fight it. That's my political position.\\" On December 6, 2000, the Daily News in New York reported, however, that he had been registered with the Republican Party in the state of New York since 1994. When questioned about this, he said that he was not aware of it and says he registered as an independent after the interview. During a broadcast of The Radio Factor, O'Reilly said that there was no option to register as an independent voter; however, there was in fact a box marked \\"I do not wish to enroll in party.\\"The Radio Factor, September 27, 2007. Despite being registered as an Independent, many view him as a conservative figure. A Pew Research February 2009 poll found that 66% of his television viewers identify themselves as conservative, 24% moderate, and 3% liberal. A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that O'Reilly was the second most trusted news personality after Rush Limbaugh. In a 2003 interview with Terry Gross on National Public Radio, O'Reilly said: = Domestic politics = O'Reilly has opined on many domestic issues. O'Reilly said the Bill Clinton impeachment stemming from the Lewinsky scandal was \\"not about sex. This is about honesty and cruelty. For Mr. Clinton, it was about undermining the justice system.\\" In the same article he writes that Gary Condit, a moderate Democratic congressman from California who had an extramarital affair with Chandra Levy prior to her disappearance and death, should be held to the same standard. According to the Newsmax publication, O'Reilly has repeatedly claimed that Clinton had the Internal Revenue Service audit him.\\"IRS Official to Judicial Watch: Clinton Enemies Were Audited\\", Carl Limbacher, NewsMax.com, April 23, 2002 O'Reilly says that he was audited three times since his program debuted in 1996. O'Reilly has been critical of former Attorney General Janet Reno, calling her \\"perhaps the worst attorney general in history\\", and that the FBI became a \\"disorganized mess\\" during her tenure. He later praised former Attorney General John Ashcroft for going after the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, as well as Enron, WorldCom, Sam Waksal of Imclone and Martha Stewart. In 2002, O'Reilly had criticized Democratic Senator Hillary Clinton, stating that she would run for president in 2008 (Which she did). In an interview with Jay Leno on The Tonight Show, he said, \\"I just feel that Hillary is a socialist, and I'm paying enough tax. Hillary wants to take my money [and] your money... and give it to strangers. There's something about that that offends me.\\" He said that she had voted for every single spending bill that year. In the same interview, he accused her of running as a political carpetbagger, and said that she intends to abolish the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote, claiming that it would be done only to give her an advantage in the presidential race.The Tonight Show, May 20, 2002. After criticizing the overturn of Snyder v. Phelps by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, O'Reilly offered on March 30, 2010 to help Snyder pay the in court costs while he prepared an appeal to the Supreme Court.Marine's dad ordered to pay protesters' court fees 2004 presidential election During the lead up to the 2004 presidential election, O'Reilly said that the Democratic Party has been taken over by the \\"far-left\\" in a conversation with former Democratic Congressman Brad Carson. Shortly following the election, O'Reilly ridiculed a message in which Democratic challenger John Kerry thanked his supporters for their support as well as opposing \\"the attacks from big news organizations such as Fox, Sinclair Broadcasting, and conservative talk radio.\\"Scoop Independent News: A Message from John Kerry - 19 November 2004 O'Reilly shot back, calling Kerry a \\"sissy\\" six times.The Radio Factor, November 29, 2004. Kerry himself stated publicly in a 2006 interview that he always felt he'd have a \\"fair shot\\" at conveying his views on The O'Reilly Factor and regrets not doing an interview prior to the election. Although O'Reilly has never officially endorsed any candidate, he did advise his audience not to support Democratic South Dakota senator Tom Daschle in his Senate re-election bid on his radio program, saying that, \\"[W]ith all due respect to the senator, we don't have any respect for him at all. And we hope he loses in South Dakota. And I -- really, I stay out of all these races, but you guys listening in South Dakota, vote for the other guy.\\"The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly, July 21, 2004. Daschle would lose the 2004 Senate election in South Dakota to John Thune. 2008 presidential election In the 2008 Democratic primary, O'Reilly urged his viewers not to vote for a candidate, this time John Edwards, and called Edwards a \\"phony\\" regarding his public statements on poverty. O'Reilly has, on many occasions, admitted to \\"having no respect for him\\", and called him \\"arrogant\\" for keeping his campaign staffer Amanda Marcotte on after making remarks O'Reilly called offensive to Christians. O'Reilly has also criticized Republicans. When speaking to Ed Schulz in 2007, O'Reilly said that then-presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani had \\"terrible character judgement\\" with Bernard Kerik and felt that \\"disqualified him from being president.\\" \\"Culture War\\" and domestic politics O'Reilly has taken to using the abbreviation \\"S-P\\", for \\"Secular Progressive\\", as a shorthand way of referring to a political category of people who want \\"drastic change\\" in the country. O'Reilly classifies the group as \\"far left\\", and almost always refers to the group in a negative manner. However, he says that he is not equating the negative qualities he sees in \\"SPs\\" with a \\"liberal\\" political ideology, saying the SP camp is far more \\"libertine\\" with social values: > Liberal thought, however, can be a good thing. Progressive programs to help > the poor, fight injustice and give working people a fair shake are all > positive. But libertine actions damage a just society because actions have > consequences. Kids who drink and take drugs are likely to hurt themselves > and others. But obviously, the SPs do not make judgments like that. In his book Culture Warrior, O'Reilly called President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. examples of liberals who were also traditionalists, also citing current US Senators Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Evan Bayh of Indiana as liberal/Democratic \\"traditionalists\\". = Foreign politics =  Immigration and border control  O'Reilly has supported stricter border controls, including placement of the National Guard troops on the US-Mexican border and has criticized President George W. Bush for not allocating enough resources to make border security effective. He also criticized Ronald Reagan's act of amnesty, claiming that it made the illegal immigration problem worse. O'Reilly makes a distinction between criminal illegal immigrants and non-criminals by saying that criminal illegal immigrants should be deported immediately. O'Reilly criticizes the lack of cooperation between local sanctuary cities and the INS. The Iraq War O'Reilly initially supported the invasion of Iraq. Speaking on ABC's Good Morning America on March 18, 2003, O'Reilly promised that \\"If the Americans go in and overthrow Saddam Hussein and it's clean [of weapons of mass destruction]...I will apologize to the nation, and I will not trust the Bush administration again.\\"Good Morning America, ABC. March 18, 2003. In another appearance on the same program on February 10, 2004, O'Reilly responded to repeated requests for him to honor his pledge: \\"My analysis was wrong and I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'm not pleased about it at all.\\"\\"Bill O'Reilly admits he was wrong about Iraq\\", Associated Press. With regard to never again trusting the current U.S. government, he said, \\"I am much more skeptical of the Bush administration now than I was at that time.\\" O'Reilly has questioned the U.S. invasion of Iraq in hindsight, in particular the performance of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. However, he maintains that the United States \\"did a good thing by trying to liberate a country\\". O'Reilly says the war effort should continue as long as progress is being made. He has also said that some anti-war activists are actively rooting for the United States to lose: > General McCaffrey says strong progress is being made. He believes the Sunnis > have turned against Al Qaeda and that the Maliki government is neutralizing > the Shi'ia death squads. Again, I don't know. With all America has > sacrificed in Iraq, though, it seems reasonable to let the end game play > out. If things are getting better, don't derail the train. But the anti-war > crew is now fully invested in defeat. So the struggle at home is becoming > even more vicious. Iraq is a shooting war. America's a political war. Both > are driven by hatred. O'Reilly called the Iraqi people a \\"prehistoric group\\", citing a poll showing that only two percent of them viewed the U.S. Forces as liberators and 55 percent preferred that they leave. \\"We cannot intervene in the Muslim world ever again\\", he said. \\"What we can do is bomb the living daylights out of them (...) no more ground troops, no more hearts and minds, ain't going to work.\\"The Radio Factor with Bill O'Reilly, June 17, 2004. In an interview with White House Press Secretary (and former Fox News colleague) Tony Snow, O'Reilly said that the United States cannot win given the circumstances of Iraqis not supporting the effort: > You can't win. No one could. No nation could unless the Iraqi people turn on > all the terrorists. And they're not. They're not, Tony. O'Reilly went on to say that the country was corrupt and compared the situation to the American support of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War: > It's like South Vietnam. It's the same thing. There were a lot of South > Vietnamese helping us. A lot fought and died on our side but there wasn't > enough of them to prevent the communists which were more united. O'Reilly would go on to praise General David Petraeus for reducing American casualties and advancing American objectives with the 2007 troop surge: > The cost has been great. We all know that. In suffering and cash. And the > Iraqi government is still a mess. But General Petraeus, backed by a brave > and professional U.S. military, has restored much order, largely defeated > the Iraqi Al Qaeda thugs, and at least given the good people of that country > a chance to prosper. General David Petraeus is \\"The Factor\\" person of the > year by a wide margin. During The Rumble with Jon Stewart, O'Reilly admitted that \\"We should not have gone to Iraq. Afghanistan we had to.\\"http://entertainment.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/07/14275237-bill-oreilly- vs-jon-stewart-10-best-moments-from-online-rumble?lite  Terrorism  O'Reilly has endorsed an aggressive War on Terror policy. He supports coercive measures to extract information from detainees at Guantanamo Bay, which he visited on two occasions. He has said that, in comparison to procedures used under the regimes of dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, the U.S.'s tactics are not torture and are beneficial even when involving physical techniques,The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel, June 16, 2005 claiming that \\"Torture is taking my fingers off, disfiguring me, taking my eye out — not keeping me in a cold room and uncomfortable with blaring rock music.\\" O'Reilly cites waterboarding as a successful coercive measure that should not be classified as torture, citing that Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed have both given up valuable information after being subjected to the technique: > In my opinion, it is immoral to allow terrorists to kill people when you can > stop them. If you capture someone who knows the inner workings of a terror > outfit, you make life very uncomfortable for that person within boundaries > set by Congress. But let's stop the nonsense here. America's not a bad > country because it waterboarded Zubaydah. The Bush administration has done > its job. We haven't been attacked since 9/11. The liberal press, > politicians, the ACLU can't stop any wrongdoing. They're all lost in a fog > of misguided indignation, crazy with hatred for Bush, but we the people must > take a stand here. This isn't a game. This is life and death. And if you > don't believe it, I know scores of people right here in New York City that > will tell you about their dead loved ones. Waterboarding should be a last > resort, but it must be an option. He has also said that detainees should be judged under military tribunals, but not protected under the Geneva Convention because the convention requires combatants to wear a uniform. He has been critical of politicians such as Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and private citizens such as financier George Soros for wanting to try terror suspects in civilian courts. O'Reilly has said that both political parties in the United States are \\"playing games\\" with regards to the war on terrorism: > ...both the right and the left are playing games to some extent. Certainly, > Al Qaeda remains dangerous, but the only way to hit them is to invade > Pakistan. Do the Democrats want to do that? On the other hand, it would be a > tragedy if after all the blood and treasure Americans have sacrificed, Al > Qaeda has not been badly damaged. America should be united in fighting these > savages, but we're not. Ideology has poisoned a reasoned, disciplined > approach to defeating the jihadists. America's great strength, diversity of > thought, can also be a weakness. And Al Qaeda knows it. The old saying goes, > \\"United we stand, divided we fall.\\" Well, we're divided. =George Soros= O'Reilly has accused billionaire businessman, investor and political activist George Soros of trying to influence the 2008 election by donating to causes and organizations that O'Reilly calls the \\"radical left\\", such as moveon.org, which regularly criticizes conservative politicians. O'Reilly said of Soros \\"If Mike Myers didn't invent Dr. Evil, some would give Soros that moniker.\\" O'Reilly also accused Media Matters for America of receiving funds from Soros;The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel, April 23, 2007. although Media Matters denies having any funding directly or indirectly from Soros,Media Matters - O'Reilly purported to chart an intricate web leading to \\"vile propaganda outfit\\" Media Matters he and the group's founder, David Brock, have raised money together to fund political advertisements challenging John McCain in the 2008 election for what politico.com called \\"attack ads\\". O'Reilly responded to the politico report by labeling Soros, Brock and Paul Begala an \\"American axis of evil\\" and saying > This, ladies and gentlemen, is ultra dangerous. Most Americans have no idea > who Soros or Brock are. They will only know what they see on TV, smear stuff > against McCain. And the pipeline extends directly to NBC News, which will > publicize every piece of slime Brock can create. Only one word describes > this: despicable. O'Reilly alleged that PBS personality Bill Moyers oversaw $500,000 worth of money transferred from the Shoeman Center Foundation (a group Soros donated to) to Media Matters. > you know, you've got to admire Soros for coming up with this organization. I > mean, you know, he's made billions by doing this in business, by being in > Curaçao and Bermuda and France, where he was convicted of a felony. And he > knows how to do this. He knows how to move the money around and use it to > gain influence. And now he's set his sights on changing the basic fabric of > this country. The organization to which O'Reilly refers is the Open Society Institute. =ACLU= O'Reilly has been critical of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), calling it \\"the most dangerous organization in the United States of America\\" especially in their challenging of the Justice Department and the Department of Defense regarding the War on Terror. He has called them a \\"fascist\\" organization in response to their threatened lawsuit against Los Angeles County for failing to remove a cross from its official seal.The O'Reilly Factor, Fox News Channel, June 2, 2004. O'Reilly alleged hypocrisy on the part of the ACLU for stating that New York City's random searches of bags in the public transportation as a breach of personal rights, but requiring people entering their New York headquarters to consent to a bag search.Fox News: Is the ACLU Bin Laden's Best Ally?. August 5, 2005. O'Reilly asserted that the ACLU is now a political organization rather than an advocacy group, taking positions and cases based on politics rather than free speech. He has come down hard on the organization for its actions on behalf of the North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) which is currently under suspicion of involvement with the rape and murder of a young boy: > Now many of these people subscribe to a philosophy of relativism. That is a > theory which says there's no absolute right or wrong. All moral values are > relative. What's wrong for you is not wrong for your neighbor if he or she > doesn't think his or her actions are wrong. That's what the North American > Man-Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is all about. Those loons believe it's OK > to rape kids because they want to. The ACLU defends NAMBLA's freedom of speech surrounding their publications and has said that the legal blame in the murder should go to who committed it. The ACLU has said that they sometimes have to defend \\"unpopular\\" speech or speech that they don't agree with, including the Ku Klux Klan's, saying their only \\"client\\" is the Bill of Rights. O'Reilly alleges the ACLU \\"cherry picks\\" its cases to promote a left wing agenda while not supporting causes of free speech that conservatives support in his criticism of the ACLU defending live sex shows in Oregon. O'Reilly decried the group's criticism of The Minutemen, claiming the latter were only engaging in a form of protest, a right the ACLU defends. O'Reilly alleges that the organization is protesting the Minutemen because they are going against the ACLU's agenda. O'Reilly accused the organization of having an anti-Christian bias when it protested the portrayal of the nativity scene in New York City Public Schools, but did not protest displayal of the Jewish menorah or the Islamic star and crescent. O'Reilly criticized the ACLU for suing San Diego County for renting property to the Boy Scouts of America in Balboa Park. The ACLU brought up a law claiming that the Boy Scouts discriminated against gays and atheists. O'Reilly criticized the San Diego City Council for voting 6-2 to vote the Scouts out before a ruling on the lawsuit was made. > It would be impossible for the Boy Scouts (search) or any children's > organization to admit avowed homosexuals because of the potential liability. > Say the Scouts put openly gay and straight kids together and some sexual > activity occurred. Well, parents could sue for millions, same way parents > could sue if the Scouts put boys and girls together and underaged sex > occurred. As far as the atheist issue is concerned, the Scouts say no > specific belief in God is necessary, only an acknowledgement of a higher > power. And that power could be nature. Come on. The whole discrimination > thing is bogus. Part of the Boy Scout Oath begins, \\"On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country\\" and the final point of the Scout Law reads, \\"A Scout is reverent,\\" with the Boy Scouts' of America official explanation being that \\"a Scout is reverent toward God. He is faithful in his religious duties. He respects the beliefs of others.\\"Fact Sheet: Boy Scout Oath, Law, Motto, and Slogan , The Boy Scouts of America, Retrieved 2007-10-23 However, the bylaws of the organization specifically state that Scouts must \\"respect the religious beliefs of others\\" and \\"in no case where a unit is connected with a church or other distinctively religious organization shall members of other denominations or faith be required, because of their membership in the unit, to take part in or observe a religious ceremony distinctly unique to that organization or church.\\" O'Reilly argues this is a liberal definition of what God may be, allowing diversity for anyone believing in a higher power to join. He went on to compare the ACLU to Nazis: > Now the ACLU is free to come to your town and sue the heck out of it. And > believe me, that organization will. The ACLU doesn't care about the law or > the Constitution or what the people want. It's a fascist organization that > uses lawyers instead of Panzers. It'll find a way to inflict financial > damage on any concern that opposes its secular agenda and its growing in > power. He later went on to criticize the Boy Scout leadership for not standing up to the ACLU. On October 16, 2006 at Mount Pleasant High School in Michigan, a student stood up publicly in the cafeteria and called the principal of the school \\"a skank and a tramp.\\" In addition to this, the student called the school administrators Nazis and questioned the sexuality of the vice- principal. The school suspended the boy for 10 days, an action that brought a lawsuit by the ACLU. O'Reilly criticized the ACLU for defending the remarks as satire when he saw it as hate speech. Social views =Abortion= O'Reilly supported California Proposition 73 because it would have required parental notification of underage girls seeking an abortion. \\"[T]he left-wing media has been able to convince millions of Americans that the government knows what's best for families, not the parents.\\" O'Reilly strongly condemns doctors who provide legal abortion services. Since 2005, he has repeatedly referred to physician and abortion doctor George Tiller as \\"Tiller the baby killer\\" on his Fox News prime time show, claiming that there must be \\"a special place in hell\\" for him. In May 2009, Tiller was murdered by anti-abortion gunman Scott Roeder. O'Reilly ardently condemns the practice of partial birth abortion. He has criticized the practice being done without explanations being made and has criticized human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for not condemning the practice: > Once again, this isn't about a women's right to choose or the New York Times > plea for reproductive rights. This is about late term abortions for just > about any reason. =Education= O'Reilly supports the discussion (but not the advocation) of intelligent design in schools and considers the opinion of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science's opposition to such theories \\"fascist\\". O'Reilly has also suggested that Richard Dawkins' argument for how science should be taught in school is equivalent to fascism. He said he supports teachers saying that some people, especially in religious groups, believe that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution is wrong. O'Reilly has said that there is a lack of leadership among the traditionalists and this has emboldened the secular-progressive cause. He consistently says that using religion to justify public policy is wrong: > Right now, religious people are the ones speaking out for traditional > values. But America does not forge public policy based on religion. Thus as > soon as God enters the debate, the secularists win. =Gun rights= O'Reilly supports some forms of gun control, such as gun registration.John Stossel on The O'Reilly FactorBillO'Reilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash, November 7, 2005: \\"Once I saw what happened in Hurricane Katrina, I said every American household should have a firearm. If there's a tremendous earthquake in San Francisco and looting, you don't want your family protected? You don't want a firearm in your house? You're living in the world of Oz. And the military is a noble enterprise. Why should the rest of the country protect your butt if San Francisco is going to thumb your nose at the military by passing this resolution?\\" =Health care= O'Reilly opposed the nationalized health care plan that filmmaker Michael Moore argues for in his film Sicko, saying it would create huge backlogs. He also said, however, that he thinks the government should perform more oversight functions on health care: > ...[G]overnment-run health care would be a disaster, featuring long waits > for treatment and an enormous rise in taxation. But there should be > government oversight on private insurance companies and strict guidelines > about abusing customers. There can be compromise and effective government > control of medical care abuse in the USA. It is possible. But if Michael > Moore's plan ever gets traction, pray hard you never get sick. =LGBT issues= O'Reilly's stance on LGBT issues has been evolving. On October 27, 2004, he was quoted saying: “I've been saying that all along, that if you open the door for gay marriage, then you have to have the polygamists and the triads and the commune people and everybody else, right?” O'Reilly supports civil unions for gay and lesbian couples, but has said that nobody has the \\"right\\" to marry; he says that marriage, like driving a car, is a privilege, not a right. He has said that if the government felt marriage was a right, then it would not stop polygamists and incestuous couples from marrying. O'Reilly further explained his position in his book Culture Warrior: > To this culture warrior, gay marriage is not a vital issue. I don't believe > the republic will collapse if Larry marries Brendan. However, it is clear > that most Americans want heterosexual marriage to maintain its special place > in American society. And as long as gays are not penalized in the civil > arena, I think the folks should make the call at the ballot box. Traditional > marriage is widely seen as a social stabilizer, and I believe that is true. On March 26, 2013, O'Reilly stated \\"I support civil unions, I always have. The gay marriage thing, I don't feel that strongly about it one way or the other. I think the states should do it.\\" O'Reilly then said, \\"The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals ... 'We're Americans, we just want to be treated like everybody else.' That's a compelling argument, and to deny that you've got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And the other side hasn't been able to do anything but thump the Bible.Scott, David Clark (March 27, 2013). \\"Bill O'Reilly: Gay marriage advocate or opponent? (+video)\\". The Christian Science Monitor. O'Reilly discussed a story surrounding around a teenage lesbian couple being elected as the \\"cutest couple\\" in their school yearbook. He stated that he believed that this couple was elected by the students to \\"tweak the adults\\" and to \\"cause trouble\\". He explains further here: > High school kids, they experiment. They experiment all over the place, they > have a chip on their shoulder. They do things just to get a reaction, just > to rebel. Parents might say \\"We don't want to normalize homosexuality in a > public way in an academic setting among minors. We don't think that reflects > how we feel about it\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g8VNUkIemw O'Reilly is known to favor adoption by a same-sex couple since 2002.Bauder, David (September 16, 2002). \\"\\"Fox News' Bill O'Reilly finds himself in fight with the right\\". Southeast Missourian. p. 4B. Google News. Retrieved February 1, 2014. O'Reilly is opposed to the School Success and Opportunity Act (Assembly Bill 1266), which extends gender identity and expression discrimination protection to transgender and gender-nonconforming K-12 students in public schools. O'Reilly described the law as \\"madness\\" and \\"anarchy\\" on Fox News Channel.O'Reilly Doubles Down: CA Transgender Rights Law Is \\"Anarchy And Madness\\" Media Matters for America, 14 August 2013 Just before the repeal of the \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" law banning homosexuals from openly serving in the military, he appeared on the Tonight Show and called the law \\"nonsense\\" and said he didn't understand why the President, in his role as commander in chief of the armed forces, simply didn't sign an executive order rescinding it. =US legal system= He regularly criticizes jurists in controversial cases as \\"activist judges.\\" He uses the issue of gay marriage as an example. \\"The folks decide that by voting and, in the case of gay marriage, the folks have decided. And that decision should be respected.\\" Jessica's Law O'Reilly is a self-professed proponent of stricter penalties for child molesters. He has fervently supported Jessica's Law, and criticized the law's detractors. He has given verbal support for Republican Doug Forrester in the 2005 New Jersey gubernatorial election, suggesting that his opponent, Democrat Jon Corzine, would be less likely to support a national version of the law, though stopped short of actually endorsing Forrester. O'Reilly has been particularly critical of the Debra LaFave case, in which she was convicted of having sex with a 14-year-old boy, but was only sentenced to house arrest and seven years probation. He criticizes many politicians who oppose mandatory minimum sentences for child molesters, and calls several states \\"child predator-friendly.\\"  Entertainment media  = Film industry = O'Reilly has been very critical of the U.S. film industry for producing films featuring violence and human suffering, such as the Saw series. He has compared this to the brutal displays of death in the Colosseums of ancient Rome.BillOReilly.com: The O'Reilly Factor Flash O'Reilly has said that films like these are marketed to children and can have consequences on their personal development. He commented on Kill Bill: Volume 1: > It's the most violent movie ever made, featuring brutal dismemberments and a > scalping close-up. And you should see the raves this movie is getting from > the pinhead critics. And who's lining up to see it? Children, that's who. O'Reilly severely chastized billionaire Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, for his support of Brian De Palma's film Redacted that portrayed the rape of an Iraqi girl by American soldiers. O'Reilly claimed that the film would be used as a recruiting tool by terrorists. = Music industry = O'Reilly has criticized the rap and hip hop industry for promoting an \\"anti- social\\" culture. He has said he does not care if adults listen to the music, but argues that children are not able to process the information and determine it to be destructive behavior. He has gone after several rappers such as 50 Cent, Jay Z, Jadakiss, Eminem, Lupe Fiasco, Nas, Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Common, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, and Young Jeezy: > Every educator that I've talked to, and I've talked to hundreds, say that > the kind of gangsta rap that Ludacris traffics in has debased the culture, > made it more difficult for them to teach children and indeed, led children > into anti-social behavior. In 2007, O'Reilly had a dispute with Nas after the rapper was hired to play a concert at Virginia Tech one year after the school had experienced the Virginia Tech massacre. \\"Having a rapper who trades in violence perform at Virginia Tech insults the victims, the university and the entire commonwealth,\\" declared Bill O'Reilly. Nas subsequently called Bill O'Reilly a racist, and accused O'Reilly of going to extremes for publicity. He repeated this stance again in July 2008, when a dispute between Nas and O'Reilly led to Nas taking a petition to Fox News, and appearing on both Fox News, and The Colbert Report. Also in 2008, Nas challenged Bill O'Reilly to a public debate, to which O'Reilly did not accept. In May 2015, O'Reilly blamed the decline of American religion particularly the declining numbers of American Christians on hip hop music citing the genre as \\"pernicious entertainment\\" and an adducing factor for contributing to the decline. O'Reilly remarked that people of faith are being marginalized by a secular media and pernicious entertainment and rap industry often glorifies depraved behavior causing the minds of people who consume the music as the least likely to reject religion.\\" American rapper Killer Mike subsequently criticized him for his remarks calling O'Reilly \\"full of more s**t than an outhouse\\" and then mocked him while he was a guest Real Time with Bill Maher. Several rappers and hip hop producers have appeared on The O'Reilly Factor. Rapper Cam'ron and hip hop entrepreneur Damon Dash appeared on the program to defend their supposed corruption of young people, to which Damon Dash responded: > So, if you know there is negative in something, try to find the positive as > opposed to always talking about the negative. That's the thing I don't > understand, why we're criticized so hard within hip-hop. No one talks about > the jobs we create, no one talks about the things we do within our > community, and no one talks about the businesses we've done, how we've > opened the doors and shown people that it's cool to be smart, it's cool to > be a CEO, and it's cool to not take advantage but to reap the benefits of > all your labor and to do it fairly. Bill O'Reilly has also interviewed Marilyn Manson on the topic of being a \\"dangerous\\" influence on U.S. youth. O'Reilly asked Manson if he thought his work encouraged kids to have sex, homosexuality, use drugs and profanity. He also asked Manson whether his songs encouraged suicide or not. Marilyn Manson answered that in his view the songs were about getting through those feelings, and that ultimately people make their own decisions.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6n5Oi4714o News media O'Reilly believes the American news media is corrupt and often criticizes it for not reporting topics that hurt the liberal agenda. He has often stated that he is the only one in the media holding people accountable on both sides. In June 2007, Adweek Magazine sponsored a survey that asked participants who they trusted more as a source of political information between ABC News and O'Reilly. According to the poll, 36 percent believe that O'Reilly is a better source than ABC News, while 26 percent believe the opposite. According to the survey, 23 percent of Democrats believed that O'Reilly was a better source while 55 percent of Republicans believed the same. O'Reilly has criticized the media for not highlighting Rosie O'Donnell's controversial remarks saying the United States attacked itself on September 11th while they highlighted Ann Coulter's remarks about calling Senator John Edwards a \\"fag.\\" O'Reilly said in response to the situation: > Doing the math, Ms. O'Donnell says something 100 times more offensive than > Ms. Coulter, in my opinion, yet there's no coverage about it. But there's no > left wing media bias in this country. Oh no! O'Reilly has criticized journalists who donate to political parties after a report stated that nine out of 10 journalists donated to Democrats or liberal causes; he has said this has resulted in news media tilting to the left. O'Reilly says that news coverage about positive improvements for American and Iraqi objectives in Iraq have been largely ignored. He conjectured that the ignoring of the positive news took place to help a Democrat win a presidential election. O'Reilly has asked his viewers and listeners to not patronize the following media outfits, saying those organizations \\"have regularly helped distribute defamatory, false or non-newsworthy information supplied by far- left websites\\": *The St. Petersburg Times *MSNBC *The New Yorker Magazine *Newsday *U.S. News & World Report *St. Louis Post Dispatch *Atlanta Journal- Constitution *Syracuse Post-Standard *Kansas City Star *Roanoke Times *Barre Montpelier Times Argus * Chicago Sun Times =Television news= In an interview with commentator Bill Maher, former CBS News anchor Dan Rather accused Fox News Channel of receiving \\"talking points\\" from the Republican controlled White House. O'Reilly criticized Rather heavily, responding that Rather did not offer any evidence to support the claim. O'Reilly cited his defense of Rather during the Memogate incident: > As you may remember, I defended Rather in the Bush National Guard debacle. I > said Rather did not intentionally put on a bogus story. He just didn't check > it out, he was too anxious for the story to be true. Now many of you > criticized me for that defense, but I'm a fact-based guy. And there's no > evidence Dan Rather fabricated anything. It was sloppy reporting that did > him in. But now the fabrication word is in play again. If Dan Rather has > evidence of White House dictums coming to FOX News employees, he needs to > display that evidence. We are awaiting his appearance. We'll let you know > when it is. O'Reilly has gone after PBS personality Bill Moyers. O'Reilly criticized Moyers for having no balance in his presentations, citing a criticism by PBS' own ombudsman. He also called Moyers dishonest for making disparaging remarks about O'Reilly to Rolling Stone and then later denying he made the remarks when confronted by one of O'Reilly's producers. CNN journalists were prominent among those critical of O'Reilly when he stated that he \\"couldn't get over the fact\\" that a largely African-American crowd at a Harlem restaurant behaved no differently than patrons of a white restaurant and garnered media coverage O'Reilly objected to CNN's portrayal of his commentary, stating that CNN had been irresponsible in mischaracterizing his remark as racist, when in fact, he said, he was actually speaking against racism. O'Reilly scolded MSNBC and CNN for not providing coverage of the ceremony that awarded Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy the Medal of Honor during their primetime shows. O'Reilly said that \\"[O]n their prime-time broadcast last night, CNN and MSNBC just said no to Lieutenant Michael Murphy and his proud family,\\" that the networks \\"despise the Bush administration and believe anything positive like American heroes in war zones, detract from their negative assessment of the administration\\" and that they should not claim to support the troops and ignore their heroism. MSNBC and CNN had covered the events during their daytime programs.MSNBC Live, October 22, 2007.CNN: The Situation Room, October 22, 2007.  NBC News and MSNBC  O'Reilly has criticized NBC News and their affiliated cable service MSNBC several times for their coverage of the war in Iraq, claiming that it is biased toward the war's opponents. \\"NBC's Anti-Iraq Bias\\"NBC reacts to Bill O'Reilly's bias criticism - NBC News TV - nbcnews.com He later called NBC News the most \\"anti-military news operation in the country,\\" when he cited an example of NBC correspondent William Arkin that called American troops \\"mercenaries.\\" He also criticized the network of trying to downplay the War on Terror in the wake of American casualties in Iraq. Robert Greenwald, who had directed the controversial documentary Outfoxed that criticized O'Reilly and the Fox News Channel, put together an event of homeless veterans criticizing O'Reilly for calling John Edwards dishonest when Edwards asserted that there were about 200,000 homeless veterans. O'Reilly denied Edwards claim, stating \\"They may be out there, but there are not many of them out there, OK. So if you know where there is a veteran sleeping under a bridge, you call me immediately, and we will make sure that man does not do it.\\" After government statistics supported Edwards, O'Reilly then said that there was no linkage between the economy and homeless veterans and claims that Veterans Affairs has up to 150,000 beds ready for them every night. O'Reilly felt Greenwald's event was a \\"contrived\\" situation after O'Reilly's producers had interviewed some of the homeless veterans whom were protesting and found out that some did not actually hear O'Reilly's comments. O'Reilly blasted NBC's Steve Capus and the New York Daily News for covering the event and claimed that Capus did not know about the nature of the event. O'Reilly called NBC hypocritical for putting supporters of legalizing prostitution in the wake of Democratic Governor of New York Eliot Spitzer resigning his post after allegedly engaging in the act in an effort and felt they would not be as defensive if a Republican had gotten in trouble. Although he praised the late Meet the Press host Tim Russert in the past, O'Reilly criticized Russert for what he saw as a misinterpretation of what were seen as potentially racially insensitive comments by former President Bill Clinton. In his comments, Russert challenged Senator Hillary Clinton about her husband's remarks regarding Senator Barack Obama, when Mr. Clinton referred to Obama's position on Iraq as a \\"fairy tale.\\" O'Reilly said that Russert \\"should have known better\\" and realized the former President's comments were regarding Obama's Iraq policy and not his entire candidacy. =Tape doctoring incidents= O'Reilly would join in the criticism of others when NBC News was found to have doctored tapes on multiple occasions. The first was about accused killer George Zimmerman that portrayed Zimmerman as having a racial motivation. He also criticized veteran news correspondent Andrea Mitchell for her reporting of a doctored tape of Mitt Romney to portray him as out of touch. After the Sandy Hook Shooting, O'Reilly and others criticized MSNBC's Martin Bashir of dishonesty when Bashir only played a part of the entire tape that portrayed the father of a victim being heckled when the entire tape showed the audience only saying something after he made it clear he was looking for an answer. O'Reilly criticized MSNBC host Rachel Maddow showed a tape of Senator John McCain portraying him as insensitive to the plight of a person who lost a family member to gun violence. Although Maddow did readily admit the tape may have been doctored, O'Reilly criticized her nonetheless for airing it knowing that it could have been edited. =Press= O'Reilly has accused the print press of purposely misquoting him and using their hard news pages to further their editorial points of view. He has said that print media is too liberal and attacks opposing viewpoints. In 2003, O'Reilly criticized the Los Angeles Times for endorsing then-governor Gray Davis, who was running against Arnold Schwarzenegger and a whole field of different candidates, including Republicans, Democrats and Independents, in a recall election. He said that he \\"has never seen a newspaper try to destroy someone as aggressively as the Times is doing.\\" He also criticized The New York Times on the same issue for referring to Schwarzenegger solely as a bodybuilder. He made the claim that Californians have canceled their subscriptions due to the \\"extreme left-wing bias\\" of the newspaper. O'Reilly has accused the media of being hypercritical of President Bush's handling of North Korea and Iran pursuing nuclear weapons while not being critical of President Bill Clinton for what was the same course of action. The New York Times O'Reilly frequently criticizes The New York Times, accusing them of omitting information that would be damaging to left-wing organizations and causes. On March 15, 2007, The New York Times ran an editorial titled \\"Immigration Misery\\" that had claimed a \\"screaming baby girl has been forcibly weaned from breast milk and taken dehydrated to an emergency room so that the nation's borders will be secure.\\" Upon further investigation, the only two babies admitted to the hospital in the area of Bedford, Massachusetts (where the raid took place) were due to dehydration because of pneumonia and not as a result of being \\"forcibly weaned.\\" O'Reilly alleged that the information in the editorial was falsified and claimed The Times wanted to promote illegal immigration in order to make the illegal immigrants into legal US citizens and register them as Democrats. He accused The Times of promoting NBC News over ABC News. On June 2, 2007, Homeland Security stopped a plot by four terror suspects thought to be linked to Al Qaeda. Authorities have alleged that the suspects were trying to blow up an oil pipeline in the Howard Beach section of New York City that carries jet fuel to JFK Airport. O'Reilly went on his program and told his listeners that he expected The Times to report it as a featured story on its Sunday edition for June 3, but found that the story was on page 37. O'Reilly accused the newspaper of burying the story not to highlight a successful foiled terror plot because it contradicts the paper's editorial point of view. O'Reilly claims that as polls show most Americans feel Republicans would do a better job of handling a terrorist threat than Democrats, The Times intentionally gave the news less exposure in hopes of influencing their readers' focus away from issues that Democrats tend to poll weaker than Republicans in. O'Reilly has also said that the paper would highlight any terrorist attack if one was to occur so they may criticize the Bush Administration: > So The Times wins both ways. The paper diminishes the War on Terror by > putting it on page 37, but if something bad ever happened, it can attack > President Bush. O'Reilly has accused the paper of being deceptive about television ratings for The O'Reilly Factor against that of MSNBC during the same time slot, citing that the paper felt that MSNBC was \\"competitive\\" with his program when O'Reilly's ratings were significantly higher. O'Reilly has questioned the paper's interpretation of violence statistics among veterans of the military. His contention is that the paper is out to disparage the military as being overly violent after returning home from deployment in the War on Terror. O'Reilly criticized the paper for running an article alleging Senator John McCain had an \\"inappropriate relationship\\" during the lobbyist controversy story the paper had. O'Reilly raised the question about why the paper had endorsed McCain on January 25, 2008 for the Republican nomination if they had information that alleged an inappropriate relationship. In May 2009, O'Reilly severely criticized the paper as \\"corrupt\\" for dropping a story about a possible violation of campaign laws by ACORN and the Obama campaign. O'Reilly claimed that sworn testimony before Congress by a former ACORN employee, Anita Moncrief corroborated the story. O'Reilly stated: > Strong evidence suggests the paper killed a story linking ACORN to some > Obama people. Instead they ran a general piece stating ACORN has a left-wing > bias, knowing that story would be largely ignored while the Obama connection > would not be. In response, the New York Times ombudsman, Clark Hoyt stated it \\"was a normal and reasonable editorial decision\\" not to run the article. He said the Times had run four other stories on ACORN. The story in question had remained unpublished because Anita Moncrief had not provided independently verifiable proof. In addition, The Times ombudsman stated that Moncrief had not given sworn testimony to Congress as claimed by O'Reilly, and that she had credibility problems, having been fired from Acorn for employee theft.Hoyt, Clark. \\"A Last Word On The Acorn Matter\\". \\"NYTimes.com\\", May 30, 2009.  Internet media  O'Reilly has accused a few liberal political websites of \\"distorting the truth\\" and \\"engaging in hatred\\": > There are no rules. These people will do and say pretty much anything to > harm people with whom they disagree politically. The trend started back in > the Clinton-Lewinsky days, and now thousands of bloggers are operating, > throwing dirt all over the place. Now they're not all bad. Some of these > bloggers are good, accurate watchdogs. But there are plenty of awful ones. He has criticized the Daily Kos website, accusing it of calling for increased attacks upon American troops in Iraq, and for Iran to attack Israel. O'Reilly has also alleged that Daily Kos bloggers have called the Pope a primate and evangelicals \\"nut cases\\", that they wish for the success of any subsequent attempts at the assassination of Vice President Dick Cheney after he avoided an attempt on his life in Afghanistan during a 2007 visit, and have said that the world is \\"better off\\" without White House Press Secretary Tony Snow when Snow publicly said he had cancer. In summer of 2007, O'Reilly said that the entire field of 2008 Democratic presidential candidates (aside from Senator Joseph Biden) went to the Yearly Kos convention that was sponsored by the Daily Kos. He has said that sites like the Kos are taking control of the Democratic Party through intimidation: > As we have been reporting, a group of far-left bloggers has succeeded in > frightening most of the Democratic presidential candidates and moving the > party significantly to the left, at least in the primary season. The lead > intimidators are MoveOn, Media Matters and the vicious Daily Kos. These > people savagely attack those with whom they disagree. And the politicians > don't want to become smear targets. So most of the Democratic candidates > have agreed to speak at the Kos convention this coming weekend, something > that is beyond shameful. O'Reilly has compared the Huffington Post to the Nazis and the KKK. He also called MoveOn.org the \\"new Klan.\\" In response, Arianna Huffington wrote that O'Reilly had confused bloggers with anonymous commentors and suggested he enroll in \\"How to Use the Internet 101.\\" Huffington alleged that offensive comments are taken down from her site when confronted by one of O'Reilly's producers. She also noted that offensive comments are posted by users of O'Reilly's own site, billoreilly.com.BillOReilly.com: \\"If [Hillary] wins... my guns are loaded\\" O'Reilly alleged that Huffington had no standards of conduct and did not remove comments about wishing Nancy Reagan had died after she fell that were written on her site. \\"She says it is down, but it is not. She does not tell the truth.\\" O'Reilly later alleged that Huffington implied Pope Benedict XVI was a Nazi. O'Reilly referred to a satirical article written by comedian Chris Kelly, which mocked O'Reilly on Huffington's website. Environmental issues O'Reilly generally supports the notion of a clean environment, although he has said that he is not entirely certain that fossil fuels are the cause of global warming. Nonetheless, he has expressed support for a long-term strategy to curb fossil fuel use. He has said he would not support the Kyoto Treaty for economic reasons, but supports the use of fewer polluting agents, more conservation, and \\"tons more innovation\\" such as tax credits for alternative fuels. He has said that renewable energy is a waste of time because \\"God controls the climate\\" and that \\"nobody can control the climate except God, so give a little extra at mass\\".99 times Bill O'Reilly lied to America  Economic views  O'Reilly is a frequent critic of government welfare and poverty programs. He is also critical of the estate tax. However, he does not differentiate between the marginal tax rate (46 percent) and the effective tax rate (roughly 9 percent). O'Reilly has said French unemployment and subsequent riots are the \\"common effects of socialist thinking\\". He claims the French unemployment rate is high because of entitlements sanctioned by the French government, and that these entitlements make employers hesitant to hire young employees for fear that they will be required to give benefits to underperforming workers. He says he supports income-based affirmative action as opposed to race-related affirmative action. =Trade with hostile countries= O'Reilly has been critical of companies doing business with countries that are hostile to the United States. O'Reilly criticized General Electric for doing business with Iran. O'Reilly cited how NBC News' correspondent John Hockenberry did a report on Dateline highlighting GE's business relationship with the Bin Laden family and was criticized by the company, who owns NBC, for the Dateline report. =Free markets, profits, and the oil companies= O'Reilly questions the free market by suggesting that the oil companies need an excuse to raise prices thereby overlooking the fact that in a free market, oil companies have the right to increase prices so as to increase profits or for any other reason. Rather than praise oil companies for their record profits, O'Reilly has been critical of oil companies, claiming their record profits are evidence that they have price-gouged Americans with artificially high gas prices. and has said he is personally boycotting products by Exxon-Mobil. It therefore appears that O'Reilly does not recognize profit maximization as a virtue. He has often taken an opposing point of view to conservatives such as fellow Fox News analyst and commentator, Neil Cavuto. During one discussion on The O'Reilly Factor, Cavuto accused O'Reilly of \\"push[ing] populist nonsense.\\" He said blocking Brazilian ethanol imports was \\"awful\\" and has criticized both the Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration for not doing enough to stem the cost of oil from \\"foreign predators\\". =Protectionism= In a May 8, 2006 article published at the Jewish World Review, O'Reilly said, \\"There is no question that illegal workers deliver more profit to business than American workers do.

The facility has over 300 exhibits for \\"children of all ages.\\" The museum opened in 1997 as COSI. After tax levies failed in 2006 and 2007, COSI closed its doors to the public on the last day of 2007 due to lack of funding. In 2008, voters approved an operating levy to reopen the facility as The Toledo Science Center. This interim name was replaced by \\"Imagination Station,\\" which opened on 10 October 2009. History In 1984, the Portside Festival Marketplace shopping mall opened along the Maumee River, on the site of the former Tiedtke's department store. There were hopes that the mall might revitalize downtown Toledo, but it closed in 1990. A mayoral committee appointed to find the best use for the site heard repeated community requests for an educational family attraction. The city asked COSI Columbus about its experience and resources, and subsequently the city and the Columbus organization created COSI Toledo, an independent, not-for-profit organization with a board of trustees from northwest Ohio. A fundraising campaign raised $9.5 million, surpassing the goal by $4.5 million. The state government gave another $10 million. The former Portside Festival Marketplace facility was transferred to COSI at a value of $16 million. On March 1, 1997, COSI opened its doors to the public. The facility attracted an average of 250,000 visitors per year over its first decade. In 2005, COSI won a National Award for Museum and Library Service from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the nation’s highest honor for extraordinary public service by a museum or library. The award was presented by Laura Bush at a White House ceremony in January 2006. On July 28, 2006, COSI Toledo and COSI Columbus legally split so each could focus on their own financial troubles. Later that year, Berrien Springs Public Schools awarded a 2006 Teachers' Choice Awards to COSI for its distance learning program. After voters voted down a second levy in November 2007, COSI Toledo closed due to lack of funding on December 31, 2007. On November 4, 2008, Lucas County, Ohio, voters approved an operating levy for the science center, enabling it to reopen in fall 2009.

Renovation In 2019, the Imagination Station launched a $10 million upgrade, including an 8,200-square-foot theater with a 4K, 3D-capable screen and seats for people. KeyBank paid $2 million to name it KeyBank Discovery Theater. The new attraction requires the demolition of a pedestrian bridge. The center remains open during the construction, which is set to be complete in June 2020.

The series climaxed with an edition about the Russian people, as distinct from the Soviet government.

Most Madrasas teach mostly Islamic subjects such as Tafseer (Interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (thousands of sayings of Muhammad), Fiqh (Islamic Law), Arabic Language; but include some non-Islamic subjects (such as logic, philosophy, mathematics), that enable students to understand the religious ones. The number of madrassas grew dramatically during and after the reign of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, and are especially popular among Pakistan’s poorest families in part because they feed and house their students. Estimates of the number of madrasas vary between 12,000 and 40,000. In some areas of Pakistan they outnumber the underfunded public schools. Most madrassas in Pakistan are Sunni, follow the doctrine of the Deobandi sect and have educated the masses about the essentials and principles of their sectarian version of Islam, throughout Pakistan. An estimated 4–10 per cent of madrassas serve the minority Shia population. Additionally there are a number of Quran academies offering diplomas in Islamic courses. For the majority of Pakistani families Madrassas may provide \\"the only realistic option\\" to educate their sons, but critics have complained that many madrassas offer almost no instruction beyond the memorizing of the Quran, and that they encourage extremism, as analysis of the profiles of suicide bombers who have struck in at least one region of Pakistan have found most attended madrasas. History The madaris rose as colleges of learning in the Islamic world in the 11th century, though there were institutions of learning earlier.George Makdisi, The Rise of Colleges: Institutions of Learning in Islam and the West, 1981: Edinburgh Univ. Press. pp. 10-24 They catered not only to the religious establishment, though that was the dominant influence over them, but also the secular one. To the latter they supplied physicians, administrative officials, judges and teachers. Conditions in madrassas were \\"regularly condemned by human rights agencies\\" as \\"crowded and undisciplined\\" according to Gilles Kepel. A 1996 report of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, for example, complained of students being held \\"in chains\\". After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, American television commentators widely associated madrassas with violence or fundamentalism. Former Pakistani president Gen. Musharraf tried to introduce an element of nominal control as an overture to American pressure, which have by and large been considered a failure. The government's 2019 plan to reform madrassas, has faced resistance. =Growth of madrassas= Estimates of the numbers of madrassas vary, but all agree their number has grown enormously, having expanded greatly during and after the rule of President General Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1988), who initially funded Deobandi madrassas with funds from his compulsory zakat collection which began in 1980. Another benefactor was Saudi Arabia who, starting in the mid-1980s, sought to counteract help the Islamist Islamic Republic of Iran was giving to the assertive Shia minority in Pakistan, with \\"substantial funds\\" to expand conservative Sunni madrassas. According to The News International, in 1947 there were only 189 madrassas in Pakistan but \\"over 40,000\\" by 2008.see also: According to David Commins book, The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia, their number grew from around 900 in 1971 to over 8,000 official ones and another 25,000 unofficial ones in 1988. In 2002 the country had 10,000-13,000 unregistered madrassas with an estimated 1.7 to 1.9 million students, according to Christopher Candland.Christopher Candland, \\"Pakistan’s Recent Experience in Reforming Islamic Education\\" in Education Reform in Pakistan: Building for the Future, (Robert M. Hathaway, ed.), 2005: Washington, D.C: pp. 151-153 According to the New York Times, as of 2009 there more than 12,000 registered madrasas and more unregistered ones in Pakistan. In some areas of Pakistan they outnumber the underfunded public schools. In 2020 it was reported that there are more than 22,000 registered madrassas (with many more unregistered) teaching more than 2 million children. Curriculum Most Madrasas teach mostly Islamic subjects such as memorization of the Quran, Tafseer (Interpretation of the Quran), Hadith (thousands of sayings of Muhammad), usul ul hadith (rules of hadith), Fiqh and Usul ul fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence and principles of Islamic Jurisprudence), Sarf and Nahw (branches of Arabic grammar), Arabic Language, Islamic Finance, Mantiq (Logic), Philosophy, classic Arabic literature and eloquence. Mastery of these subjects qualifies a student to become an Islamic scholar or cleric (maulvi or maulana). In terms of religious doctrine, many of the madrasas are funded by Saudis groups and combine Deobandi ideology with \\"Wahhabism as reflected in the education imparted to students in Saudi Arabia government.\\" Critics complain on intolerance in teachings as reflected in the line that \\"Muslim pupils in radical madrassas chant at the morning assembly: \`When people deny our faith, ask them to convert and if they don't destroy them utterly.\`\\" Other Saudi madrassas, particularly schools in Afghan refugee camps, may provide an interpretation of Islam that \\"blends Pushtun ideals and Deobandi views, precisely the hallmark of the Taliban.\\" The vast expansion of madrasas during the 1980s meant a shortage of qualified teachers such that \\"quite a few teachers did not discern between tribal values of their ethnic group, the Pushtuns and the religious ideals.\\" Madrassas teach Arabic and while there are over 70 languages in Pakistan, few Pakistanis speak Arabic. The Economist found that of the children who complete five years of primary school, only half are literate. Importance =Social bonding and obedience= Providing free room and board to impoverished students, and shelter from the privations of poverty, the primarily Deobandi madrassas had a powerful esprit de corps. After many years in \\"conditions of intense intimacy\\" with little or no contact with the outside world, Madrassa students tended to be \\"extremely devoted\\" to their teachers. The strict doctrinaire teaching based on memorization discouraged even \\"the smallest expression of free thought or individual will\\", and gave root to fanaticism and a willingness to fight \\"anyone designated\\" an unbeliever by the master -- whether a Shiite neighbor, Indian soldiers, even other Sunni Muslims. =Social mobility= The madrassas have been called \\"the only realistic option\\" for the majority of Pakistani families to provide education for their sons. Another source (Sadakat Kadri) has stated that \\"absent an educational Marshall Plan, the hope of educating a literate breadwinner is about as bright a future as millions of families will ever get,\\" and that the schools offer \\"shelter from the social storm ... camaraderie instead of chaos,\\" for lower middle class Pakistanis. In some areas of Pakistan they outnumber the underfunded public schools. =Jihadi recruitment= A 2008 US diplomatic cable expressed alarm that Saudi Arabian- financed madrassas were fostering \\"religious radicalism\\" in \\"previously moderate regions of Pakistan\\" as children from impoverished families were sent to isolated madrassas, and once there often recruited for \\"martyrdom operations\\". > “Graduates” of the madrassas are supposedly either retained as teachers for > the next generation of recruits, or are sent to a sort-of postgraduate > school for jihadi training. “Teachers at the madrassa appear to make the > decision,” of where the students go next, “based on their read of the > child’s willingness to engage in violence and acceptance of jihadi culture > versus his utility as an effective proponent of Deobandi or Ahl-e-Hadith > ideology/recruiter.” =All-female madrassas= There are almost 2,000 registered Islamic religious schools for girls, educating almost a quarter of a million young women and providing more than half of the candidates sitting graduate-level exams every year. Oxford academic, Dr Masooda Bano has said that the madrassas gave women economic and social opportunities. = Influence = The tens of thousands of pupils and graduates of Deobandi madrassas gave that school of Islam the ability to \\"intervene directly\\" in Pakistani political life and \\"to contest everything that appeared to compromise their view of the Islamic world order,\\" according to political scientist Gilles Kepel. Child sex abuse The sexual abuse of children is a problem in many Pakistan madrassas and has been described as an \\"endemic\\". Post 9/11 oversight After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, the US government encouraged former Pakistani president Gen. Musharraf to do something about Madrassas. Musharraf tried to introduce an element of nominal control. Two laws were passed: one to create state-controlled madrassas (model: Dini Madaris, 2001); the other to register and control them (2002). The first had moderate success, as some religious institutions registered in 2003 with the Pakistan Madrasah Education Board created by this law. However, the three alternative institutions it created suffer from organizational difficulties. The second measure proved unpopular with the madrassas, but the government has restricted some access of foreign students to the madaris education system. Madrassas in Pakistan have been used to recruit jihadists and as a pretext to finance militancy as has been mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report. For example, officials with the Lashkar-e-Taiba's charity wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, travelled to Saudi Arabia seeking donations for new schools, vastly inflating the schools costs to the donors – then siphoned off the excess money to fund militant operations. =Overseeing bodies= The Ittehad Tanzimat Madaris-e-Deeniya, a federation of the five Waqfs (seminary boards) in Pakistan, represents AhleSunnat Wal Jamaat Deoband, AhleSunnat Barelwi, Ahl-e Hadith, Shia and Jamaat-e-Islami schools of thought. Muhammad Muneeb ur Rehman is the president of Ittehad Tanzimat Madaris-e-Deeniya Pakistan. Comparative studies In addition to the South Asian Dars-i-Nizami curriculum, the students read books in Urdu as part of comparative religion or training in the beliefs of the sub-sect (maslak). These texts are taught in a manner in order to promote understanding of differences and similarities as they exist, with the stated goal of respect for human diversity. Subjects such as Western ideologies — capitalism, individualism, freedom, feminism, socialism, democracy, human rights are discussed in the context of how they relate to the Muslim thought and identity prevalent in the schools.

It is in use in Croatia, Cuba, Norway, Serbia, Kosovo, Sweden and Uruguay. The production of the railcars was begun in 1980 by Kalmar Verkstad and Fiat Ferroviaria for Sweden. Italy The Y1 is based on the Italian model ALn 668. This diesel railcar was built during the period 1954–1981, with 787 built. Sweden SJ, the Swedish railways, needed new diesel railcars for lines like Inlandsbanan. SJ bought this model from Fiat. They were based on an existing model, but modified for Swedish needs. The first were produced in Italy, and later in Kalmar, Sweden. 100 vehicles were made during the period 1979–1981. There were some variations, with some having a cargo area, needed in the remote parts of northern Sweden where mail and parcels are often transported by passenger buses and trains. They have 68 or 76 seats, but 48 only in those equipped with a cargo area. As first delivered, the vehicles had Fiat engines. During the 1990s several were updated and acquired new Volvo DH10 bus engines. Many Y1s have been resold to other countries such as Uruguay and some of the former Yugoslavian countries. Today most of the Y1s still in use in Sweden are owned by regional transport authorities, rather than by SJ AB, where they have been replaced by Bombardier Itino trains. The only regular line to use these railcars in regular traffic today is Kinnekullebanan. A number of Y1 railcars are nevertheless stationed at different places around Sweden as reserve trains. The summer-only tourist service on Inlandsbanan also uses these railcars. Croatia Classified as series 7122 by Croatian Railways, second-hand examples began arriving from Sweden in 1996. As of 2017, there are 35 of them in service. These units have replaced HŽ series 7221 Šinobus units on branch lines. The 7122s are used in Istria and Dalmatia and around Bjelovar, Varaždin, Osijek and Karlovac. Almost all of the incoming units were painted in standard orange-black livery. However, since 2007, a new, silver, blue and red livery was introduced. Some units are also coloured in silver livery, with a blue stripe on the bottom and modern HŽPP logo above. Serbia Former Swedish Y1 railcar, now Železnice Srbije class 710, on its way to Niš near Matejevac, Serbia. Classified as series 710 by Serbian Railways, second-hand examples began arriving from Sweden in 2005. They were all painted in a white, blue, and black livery. The units are being retired as new Class 711 units enter service. Norway Norges Statsbaner operated three units on the Bratsberg Line, between Porsgrunn and Notodden, from 2000 until August 2015. Purchased second-hand from Swedish State Railways and painted in a more orangey shade of red than that normally applied to NSB stock, the units were not classified according to the standard NSB system, but were referred to as Y1. Kosovo A total of four former SJ Y1 railcars (nos 1281, 1304, 1306, 1313) were sold to Kosovo Railways in 2007 http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33617560_ITM for service on local trains between Pristina and Peć.

On 23 February 1894, a meeting at Buxton Town Hall decided to rebuild a landmark tower that had been built by Solomon Mycock, of the Cheshire Cheese Hotel, in the early 19th century, and of which only a few stones remained. The Local Board vice-chairman had talked with the seventh Duke of Devonshire's agent and decided that the reconstruction was feasible if the townspeople would donate sufficient money. Sketches were submitted by architects W. R. Bryden and G. E. Garlick. By that May, the plans were confirmed by the Duke of Devonshire, and it was well known that the site was of prehistoric importance. In June 1894, the seventh Duke of Devonshire subscribed £25 towards building the folly. Buxton had already subscribed £50. The foundation stone was laid by Colonel Sidebottom, M.P., on 31 May 1896, witnessed by a large crowd, and the tower was opened by Victor Cavendish in September 1896. The tower was restored in 1988 by public subscription.\\"Solomon's Temple\\", Atlas Obscura, accessed 26 May 2019 The structure is a , two-storey tower built on top of a Bronze Age barrow, sitting on top of a ridge at a height of 440 metres (1,440 ft) above sea level. From the open top of the tower there are good 360-degree views over the town and the surrounding countryside and parts of the Peak District. The tower does not contain anything other than the staircase to the top. It is a Grade II listed building.

At the age of about 30, this Jesuit priest arrived in New France in 1664 and stayed for eleven years. He was fascinated by the wildlife and Native peoples of the New World, and is believed to have been the author of the hand-drawn book known as the ', which documents these subjects. Nicolas is the confirmed author of the books ' and the '. He returned to France in 1675, and historians believe that he died in 1682. Nicolas was born in Aubenas, Vivarais, a commune in the Ardèche department. At the age of twenty, he joined the Jesuits, a male congregation of the Catholic Church. In 1664, his order was sent to Canada to convert the Aboriginal peoples. As he travelled from the western end of Lake Superior to Sept-Îles, and from Trois-Rivières to the south of Lake Ontario, Nicolas’ interest in Aboriginal languages and culture increased. Nonetheless, according to the Jesuit Relations, Nicolas did not always behave accordingly towards the native peoples. In fact, in a memoir by Antoine Alet, secretary to Sulpician superior M. de Queylus, the Jesuit was \\"described as a quick-tempered and rather vain man.\\" Moreover, his congregation was not pleased with him as he attempted to tame two bear cubs at the Jesuits' residence in Sillery, in the hope of impressing the king. In 1675, Louis Nicolas left Canada and returned to France. Nothing more was heard of him after his departure. References Further reading * *Gagnon, François-Marc. Louis Nicolas: Life & Work.
