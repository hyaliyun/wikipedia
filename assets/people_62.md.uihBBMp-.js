The court's decision was considered problematic as it favoured the uniformity of application of the Brussels regime jurisdictional rules temporarily over party autonomy. Due to similar provisions in the 2001 Brussels Regulation and Lugano Conventions, the interpretation also affects choice of court agreements under those later instruments. However, in the 2012 Recast version of the Brussels I Regulation chosen courts can take jurisdiction, even if a court not chosen has been addressed first.Mentioned as a goal in Recital 22 of the Recast Regulation. Facts Austrian supplier Gasser and Italian distributor MISAT entered into a contract together for the supply of children's clothes. In the contract, they included a choice-of-court agreement, stipulating that an Austrian court have jurisdiction in case of conflict. However, when a dispute arose between the two parties, MISAT seised an Italian court to declare that the contract had been terminated, contrary to the choice-of-court clause they agreed on. MISAT relied on Article 21 of the Brussels Convention, a convention to which all members of the European Community were party, and which regulates which court within those states has jurisdiction. The convention contains a lis alibi pendens-rule: where proceedings involving the same issue and between the same parties are brought before the courts of different Member States, the court seised second must stay proceedings up until the jurisdiction of the court first seised has been established ‚Äì after which the court second seised must decline jurisdiction if the court first seised is indeed found to have jurisdiction.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 106. Consequently, Article 21 of the Convention establishes a type of \\"first come, first served\\"-rule: when there is a triple identity in parties,Case C-406/92 The Tatry, [1994] ECR I-5439 object, as well as cause of action,Case C 144/86 Gubisch Maschinenfabrik, [1987] ECR 4861, ¬ß38. the court that has been seised second will only be able to decide in the case when it has been decided in the first court that the latter has no jurisdiction. The Report Jenard cites the need to \\"facilitate the proper administration of justice within the Community\\" as the underlying idea behind this lis alibi pendens rule,Report Jenard, OJ [1979], C-59/41. as irreconcilable judgments would obstruct such proper administrationSee the Court's reasoning in Case C-406/92 The Tatry, [1994] ECR I-5439, ¬ß31. and ultimately be detrimental to the \\"mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Community\\".Recital 16 of the Regulation. Consequently, the lis pendens-rule can be considered as an expression of the Regulation's search for both certainty and the preservation of mutual trust amongst Member States.Van Calster, G., European Private Law, Oxford, Hart Publishing, 2013, 107. The problem however in the case at hand was that the parties had first made an agreement as to which court would have jurisdiction in case of conflict- namely an Austrian court. Consequently, Gasser brought the same case before the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court) Innsbruck in Austria, where the question was eventually passed on to the European Court of Justice of whether or not the lis pendens-rule could override the parties' autonomous decision contained in their choice-of-court agreement and thus, if the abovementioned rule contained in Article 21 of the Convention was applicable or not.Gasser v MISAT CJEU procedure The reference for a preliminary ruling were made on 25 March 2002, and observations were made -in addition to the parties in the dispute- by Italy, the United Kingdom and the European Commission. While Italy, the Commission and Misat contended that the lis pendens doctrine needed to take precedence, and that thus the court second seized should stay its proceedings until the first court had decided on its position, the UK and Gasser argued that the choice of the parties should take immediate precedence over the lis pendens rule. =Advocate-General= The (advisory) opinion of Advocate- General was delivered on 9 September 2003. The Advocate-general held that the European Court of Justice had the possibility to rule that a valid choice of court clause amounted exclusive jurisdiction to a (group of) courts, and that thus it was possible to derogate from using the lis pendens doctrine and give such a court immediate jurisdiction. The court had made a similar exception before in Overseas Union Insurance Ltd and Deutsche Ruck Uk Reinsurance Ltd and Pine Top Insurance Company Ltd v New Hampshire Insurance CompanyC-351/89 where it ruled that if one of the \\"exclusive jurisdiction\\" grounds of Article 16 applied, the court that had exclusive jurisdiction did not have to stay proceedings, even if it was seized second. The exclusive jurisdiction of choice of court agreements/clauses is however placed in Article 15, and thus is not automatically covered by the judgments. The Advocate general suggested to only allow a court seized second (and which was chosen in a choice of court clause/agreement) \\"where there is no room for any doubt as to the jurisdiction of the court second seised\\"; to avoid the situations where both courts would assume jurisdiction. =Decision= The Court resolutely rejected the possibility that the party autonomy could take precedence over the abovementioned goals of certainty and mutual trust, stating that \\"the court second seised is never in a better position than the court first seised to determine whether the latter has jurisdiction\\". Even though the Austrian court was consistent with the parties choice-of-court agreement, it was for the court first seized to decide it had not jurisdiction and the presence of such a clause is \\"not such as to call in question the application of the procedural rule contained in Article 21 of the Convention [now Article 27], which is based clearly and solely on the chronological order in which the courts involved are seised\\". Relevance The ruling by the Court has implications not only for the application of the Brussels Convention, but also by the Brussels I Regulation (44/2001) that mostly replaced it, and for the interpretation by EU states of the Lugano Conventions of 1998 and 2007 that contain similar provisions. First, there is the (unlikely) risk that the court first seised finds the jurisdiction clause invalid, which consequently takes away the possibility for the designated court to decide the case, even if the latter would have declared the clause valid.U. Magnus & P. Mankowski, Brussels I Regulation: 2nd Revised Edition, Sellier European Law Publishers, 2011. Although the Court in Gasser first seems to minimise the likelihood of this hypothesis by stating that a jurisdiction clause \\"must be regarded as an independent concept\\", it nonetheless points out that verifying the existence of jurisdiction clauses \\"may necessitate delicate and costly investigations\\". As a result, although unlikely, there is still a risk that two courts from different Member States will decide upon the validity of a jurisdiction clause differently. Second, the Court's ruling, which imposes a sort of absolute first-come, first-served principle, promotes the use of tactical litigation and \\"torpedo claims\\". The reason why can be described as the difference between theory and reality.P. Briza, \\"Choice-of-court agreements: could the Hague choice of court agreements convention and the reform of the Brussels I Regulation be the way out of the Gasser-Owusu desillusion?‚Äù, in Journal of Private International Law Vol. 5 No. 3 (December 2009), 541. In theory, the fact that a party would have to turn to a different Member State for a ruling in his case is irrelevant or even meaningless, as the Brussels I Regulation rests upon the axiomatic assumption that procedural justice is served wherever in the community proceedings are heard. In reality however, this fact is of great tactical significance to the recalcitrant party, since -apart from the aforementioned fact that the first court seised may determine the effect of Article 23 differently- some Member States have a system of much slower-moving judiciary, which makes the realisation of procedural justice unlikely. Italy is a prime example thereof, with decisions on jurisdiction alone taking several months or even years; commencing proceedings in Italy is accordingly dubbed \\"firing the Italian torpedo\\".T. Hartley, \\"The European Union and the Systematic Dismantling of the Common Law of Conflict of Laws\\" 2005 (54) International & Comparative Law Quarterly 813, 816‚Äì17. This torpedo may well sink a jurisdiction agreement, as the crude confrontation with increased delay and expense for the other party makes it not only unlikely for him to recommence proceedings in the agreed court after jurisdiction has been settled, but can even deter him from litigating altogether at the sight of the location of the court first seised. In conclusion, not only may the party defending the choice-of-court agreement experience substantive disadvantages in the other Member State, as the court situated there might declare the agreement invalid, the party may also be exposed to procedural disadvantages, caused by judicial system which is not chosen. This in turn can make the jurisdiction agreement ineffective altogether, going against the principle of party autonomy.E Gottschalk and S Bre√üler, \\" Missbrauch von Gerichtsstandsvereinbaurngen im europ√§ischen Zivilprozessrecht\\" [2007] Zeitschrift f√ºr Europ√§isches Privatrecht 56, 74. Taking a formalistic and literal approach, the Court states that \\"the difficulties of the kind (...) stemming from delaying tactics by parties (...) are not such as to call in question the interpretation of the Brussels Convention, as deduced from its wordings and purpose\\", pointing out that the Regulation \\"is necessarily based on the trust which Contracting States accord to each other's legal systems and judicidial institutions\\". Effect on the Brussels Regulation In the Recast of the Brussels I Regulation, the Commission addressed the problems created by the Gasser judgment.Commission, \\"Green Paper on the review of Council Regulation (EC) no 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters\\" COM(2009) 175 final, ch 3, 5. Dealing with the problematic tactical litigation spawning from the Gasser judgment, the Recast Regulation now contains a reversal of the priority rule, by giving the court chosen by the parties in the jurisdiction agreement precedence over all other courts, regardless of when proceedings were initiated.See Article 31(2) and Article 29 of the Recast Regulation, especially \\"without prejudice\\". See also the new Recital 22. From a prima facie point of view, this certainly seems to deal the Gasser problem effectively, as a tactical race to the court is now without effect.P. Beaumont and P. McEleavy, AE Anton Private International Law (3rd edn, W Green 2011) 259. However, some have raised the question to whether or not this will simply encourage the use of 'sham jurisdictional agreements',D. Sancho Villa, 'Jurisdiction over Jurisdiction and Choice-of-Court Agreements: Views on the Hague Convention of 2005 and Implications for the European Regime' (2010) 12 Yrbk Priv Intl L 399, 404. and if this indisputable preference for allegedly- chosen courts could not just lead to ‚Äúimproved‚Äù or ‚Äúreverse‚Äù torpedo claims.F.

History The idea started from an alumnus of Dar al-'Ulum in Mecca named H. Zamzam who since 1910-1912 CE was the religious teacher in the religious school Dar Al-Muta'alim√Æn. H. Zamzam founded the organization along with his close friend H. Muhammad Yunus. Both of them were born in Palembang. Muhammad Yunus, a trader who was quite successful, in his youth earned a traditional religious education and mastered the Arabic language, so he could self-taught through the scriptures of interests. The equal educational background and culture uniting them in Islamic discussions. The topics of their discussions were usually matters related to religious movements that were developing at the time, or religious matters published in the magazine al-Munir in Padang or in al-Manar magazine published in Egypt. Figures of PERSIS organization (A.Hassan is second from the left) One time, there was a discussion took place after an event festivity at the home of a family member, a native of Sumatra that had been living in Bandung. The matter of the discussion was about religious disagreement between al-Irshad and Jamiat Kheir. Since then, subsequent meetings transformed into a group of reviewers, a sort of club in the field of religious studies in which members of the group gladly reviewed, assessed, and tested the teachings they had received. Their discussions were also held with the Jum'ah prayer congregation, so the frequency increased and the discussion deepened. The number of people was originally only about 12 people. The discussions intensified and became not just limited to religious issues, but wider and more political, such as on the dichotomy between traditional and Islamic Modernism that was occurring at the time between scholars of Jamiat Kheir and al-Irshad in Batavia, or the issue of communist infiltration in Sarekat Islam (SI) and the efforts Muslims tried to confront it. In 1924, Ahmad Hassan bin Ahmad (born in Singapore; December 31, 1887 CE ‚Äì died in Surabaya, November 10, 1958 CE), a descant of Tamil father (Ahmad) and a Javanese Tamil mother (Muznah; she was born in Surabaya but her family originally was from Palekat in Madras), joined in the discussions at PERSIS. Hassan was smart and mastered Islamic Sciences and General knowledge at large as well as fluent in Arabic, English, Malay and Tamil language. He obtained religious education in Singapore and Johor, and enjoyed writing articles on Utusan Melayu newspaper published in Singapore. In terms of naming, PERSIS from the beginning was liberal. At the time, it was uncommon for an Islamic organization to be named with Non-Arabic name. The abbreviated name of Persatuan Islam \\"PERSIS\\", which means Persian in Latin, was regarded as a westernized word influenced by the Dutch colonialism. Moreover, sanctity and identification of Islam with Arabic was very strong among Muslims at the time. This means that they were ready to accept the risk and to maintain the establishment and the confidence they had over the use of the Latin name, unlike prior organizations such as Jamiat Kheir, Muhammadiyah, and al-Irshad that all use Arabic names. PERSIS transforms into a bolder and more extreme organization than the Muhammadiyah and al-Irshad in opposing heresy, myth and superstition that are considered Islamic. It also harshly criticizes Ba 'Alawi sada's adherence to taqlid and rejection of ijtihad, visitations of tombs (ziyarat) and consequent approval of saint worship, Kafa'ah between Sayyid women and non-Sayyid men, and the belief about elevated status of Arab Indonesians in the Indonesian Muslim community. PERSIS publicity was gained mainly through printed media, with its first published magazine Pembela Islam published in October 1929 in Bandung. The publication lasted until 1933 and managed to publish 72 numbers with a circulation of 2,000 copies, spreading all over the country and even to Malaysia and Thailand. In November 1931, PERSIS published a special magazine discussing issues of religion, without challenging the Non Muslim parties. The magazine was named al-Fatwa written in Jawi letters, resulting in more demand by the Muslims in Sumatra, Borneo and Malaysia. However, the publication of this magazine only lasted until October 1933 with 20 issues and 1000 copies. In 1935 The al-Fatwa was replaced with a new magazine called al-Lisaan that lasted in June 1942 with 65 as its last issue number. During the life of the al-Lisaan magazine, A. Hassan moved to Bangil, so issue number 47 (published in May 1940) to issue number 65 were published in Bangil, Pasuruan, East Java. Besides running the publishing house, A. Hassan also built a PERSIS boarding school in Bangil.See \\"Bangil\\" Article See also * Jamiat Kheir * Muhammadiyah * al-Irsyad * Ahmad Surkati References  * Category:Islamic organizations established in 1923 Category:Indonesian National Awakening Category:Islamic organizations based in Indonesia ","title":"PERSIS (organization)"},{"id":"43094970","text":"In cryptography, a Key Checksum Value (KCV) is checksum of the key value used to compare keys without knowing their actual values.

The case was long thought to have established the operation of the common recovery, a collusive legal procedure that was, until finally abolished in 1833, an important element of English law of real property. By means of a complex legal fiction, a recovery converted a freehold or copyhold property held in fee tail, which could not be freely sold or disposed of, into an estate in fee simple, which could be disposed without restriction. Although the principles of the common recovery had existed before 1472, the extensive discussion of these principles by the judges in Taltarum's Case meant that in succeeding centuries the common recovery's procedures, and even the names of some of the fictitious individuals involved in them, were modelled on the case. Although traditionally known as Taltarum's Case, this name was in fact a misspelling: it was originally entered in the Plea Rolls as \\"Talcarn's Case\\". The name of the individual referred to, one Thomas Talcarn of Godcote in Cornwall, was spelt Talcarn, Talcarum, or Talkarum, in the original documents, though never in the form \\"Taltarum\\" under which the case became famous.Fisher, H. A. L. (ed). The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland, Vol 2, Cambridge UP, 1911, p.310Baker and Milsom Sources of English Legal History: Private Law to 1750, OUP, 2010, p.68 The case would be referred to as Hunt v Smyth if modern naming conventions were followed.Megarry, R. The Law of Real Property, Sweet & Maxwell, 2012, p.72 The principle of barring the entail Entails had been established by the Statute of Westminster 1285. The statute included a clause known by the title De donis conditionalibus (\\"concerning conditional gifts\\"), which enacted that in grants of land to a man and the heirs of his body, the will of the donor as expressed in the grant should be strictly followed. Prior to this time, judges had held that if an estate was granted to a man and the heirs of his body, and heirs were subsequently born, he had title to the land in fee simple and could do as he wished with it, including selling it, even if this was contrary to the original donor's intent. The effect of De donis, however, meant that if an estate was granted to a man and the heirs of his body, he could not dispose of it any other way; it had to pass to his heirs. Furthermore, if the heirs died out, the donor could claim the land back: this right was known as the \\"reversion\\". Such an estate was said to be in \\"fee tail\\", derived from the French tailler, to cut, as the inheritance was cut down and confined to the heirs of the body. While the statute had originally been intended to strengthen the feudal system by preventing land passing out of a family's ownership, in the following centuries, landowners became increasingly frustrated with the restrictions imposed by entails. The common recovery, the outline of which had probably been established in the mid fourteenth century, was developed to circumvent these restrictions. Its underlying principle was that an entail could be broken if the issue (i.e. the persons who would otherwise have received the land under the entail) were compensated.Simpson, A. Legal Theory and Legal History: Essays on the Common Law, Black, 1987, pp.147 The compensation was, however, a fictitious one, created only for the purpose of breaking the entail.The process worked as follows: The owner (in tail) of the land, A, wished to convert it from fee tail to fee simple. Accordingly, he conveyed it to someone else B (known as the tenant in praecipe, usually a lawyer acting for the owner) to the intent that a third person C (known as the demandant, and usually an estate trustee or the purchaser, if the land was being sold) might sue for it. C accordingly issued a writ against B, saying he had been unjustly dispossessed of the land by a (fictitious) individual usually named as \\"Hugh Hunt\\". In court, B defended his right saying (correctly) that he had acquired it from A. A (now called the vouchee) was called upon to vouch for his right to the land. He alleged that he had acquired it from D (a person known as the common vouchee, and whose part was usually played by the court crier). D asked for time and failed to appear subsequently; alternatively, he dashed out of the court. In either case, the judgment was that C should recover the land, and that D should compensate B with land of equal value. However, D was chosen because he was a man of straw with no property at all, so that the judgment against him was valueless, and it was never enforced. The result was thus that C recovered the land in fee simple, which A had owned in only fee tail. Being held in fee simple, the land could now be freely sold or transferred or a new settlement made, thus defeating De donis conditionalibus. The exact principle by which the entail was barred was merely inferred from the judges' reasoning in Taltarum's Case, rather than being an explicit part of their judgment. The four judges had been considering what effect a recovery would have when multiple entails existed: would it bar all entails, or only that of which the defendant was seised at the time?Biancalana, J. The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176‚Äì1502, CUP, p.299 The conclusion they drew was that it would only bar the entail under which the defendant was then in possession. Based on this reasoning, lawyers had developed the device of the \\"double voucher\\": if the owner in tail conveyed the land to someone else, the \\"tenant in praecipe\\", at the start of the procedure, and the demandant then sued the tenant in praecipe rather than simply suing the owner directly, the recovery would not only bar the land passing to the owner's heirs, it would also extinguish any other entails, in addition to the claim of the original donor in the event the heirs died out. Solomon Atkinson, in The Theory and Practice of Conveyancing (1839), stated the facts (as then understood) thus: \\"in the reign of Ed. 4 [...] the judges [...] determined, that even a nominal and fictitious recompense, descending to the issue in tail, should be an effectual bar, not only to the issue in tail, but also to the persons entitled in remainder and reversion. This, though not expressly so decided, is the inference drawn from the determination of the judges in the celebrated case 12 Ed. 4, known as Taltarum's case. \\"Atkinson, S. The Theory and Practice of Conveyancing, Vol 1, 1839, p.216 History of the case Thomas Littleton, J.C.P., was one of the four judges in Taltarum's Case, which took place at the time he was writing his Treatise on TenuresSpinosa, C. D. \\"The Legal Reasoning Behind the Collusive, Common Recovery\\" in The American Journal of Legal History, Vol. 36, No. 1 ,1992, 80 Legal authorities' comments on Taltarum's Case had been based on two slightly contradictory reports written in the Year Book, rather than on the original records. The true history of the case was eventually researched by Frederic William Maitland, who located it on the De Banco Roll for Mich. 12 Edward IV, m.631 (1472) http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT2/E4/CP40no844/aCP40no844fronts/IMG_1229.htm & subsequent membranes . He noted that it concerned a messuage and 100 acres of land in Portreath, Cornwall.Fisher, H. A. L. (ed). The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland, Vol 2, Cambridge UP, 1911, p.310 Maitland continued: \\"The plaintiff was Henry Hunt; the defendant was John Smyth. The action was on the statute of 5 Richard II against forcible entry, and the plaintiff sued \\"tam pro domine Rege quam pro seipso\\". The original feoffor mentioned in the defendant's plea was Thomas Trevistarum. In the plaintiff's replication the famous recovery is alleged to have taken place in the Easter term of 5 Edward IV, before Robert Danby and his fellow justices of the bench. The writ stated that John Arundel, the lord of the fee, had remised his court. The demandant in it was Thomas Talkarum or Talcarum. His name is written many times, now with a k, now with a c, never with a t. The vouchee was Robert Kyng. The well-known rejoinder about the settlement made by John Tregoz was pleaded only as to twenty-four acres, parcel of the land in question. As to the residue the plaintiff pleaded in a more general fashion that at the time of the recovery Humphrey Smyth was not seised of the freehold, and that therefore the recovery was void in law\\"Fisher (ed) 1911, p.311 Maitland noted that at the time the report, characterised by a \\"rambling obscurity\\", was written up in the Year Book, the judgment did not actually seem to have been given, and could not locate the eventual record of judgment in the case itself. Puzzled by the \\"hypothetical state of facts\\" about which the four judges - including Chief Justice Bryan and Justice Littleton - in the forcible entry case had been arguing, Maitland determined: \\"Talkarum, the recoveror, having obtained judgement, did nothing more during the lifetime of Humphrey Smyth, the tenant in the action. Humphrey died seised: on his death Robert Smyth entered, and on Robert's death John Smyth entered. Then Talkarum entered on John and enfeoffed Henry Hunt, then John entered and cast out Hunt, and this was the forcible entry complained of [...] Leaving to Cornishmen the question whether Talkarum and Trevistarum are possible names, I cannot refrain from the remark that the name Henry Hunt is beautifully simple.\\" Fisher (ed) 1911, p.312 More recent research has shown that the background of Taltarum's Case was as follows. A man called Thomas Trevistarn granted land in Portreath to one William Smyth in fee tail. On William Smyth's death, his eldest son and heir Humphrey took possession of the land under the entail. Humphrey Smyth then conveyed part of the land to a man called John Tregoz, probably as part of a marriage settlement, and Tregoz accordingly reconveyed it back entailed on Humphrey and his wife Jane, with remainder to Humphrey's heirs. Humphrey's wife died childless, and he suffered a recovery of the land to another man, Thomas Talcarn (the person whose name was afterwards misspelt \\"Taltarum\\"). At this point, Humphrey probably believed that the recovery, in accordance with usual practice, would bar both existing entails.Biancalana, p.274 Talcarn, in turn, conveyed it to Henry Hunt - probably without even taking possession. However, on Humphrey Smyth's death, John Smyth, the son and heir of Humphrey's younger brother Robert, claimed possession of the land under the original entail, evicting Hunt. The case itself was concerned with Hunt's action on forcible entry against John Smyth.Biancalana, J. The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176‚Äì1502, CUP, p.270 Hunt would be able to get a favourable judgment if he, and his lawyer John Catesby, could demonstrate that the recovery to Talcarn had destroyed the operation of the entail originally created by Trevistarn.Biancalana, J. The Fee Tail and the Common Recovery in Medieval England: 1176‚Äì1502, CUP, p.270 It also appears that a counter-action by Smyth - represented by Guy Fairfax - against Hunt, for writ of formedon in the descender, was going on at the same time as the forcible entry action by Hunt against Smyth, and that elements of the pleadings in the descender action became included with the report of the forcible entry action.Biancalana, p.272 This might explain the confusing and obscure nature of the reports. Smyth's success hinged on the argument that, at the time his uncle had suffered a recovery of the land to Talcarn, he was only in possession of the land under the later Tregoz entail to him and Jane, rather than the original Trevistarn entail: proving this would mean that John Smyth could still claim the land under the original entail.Biancalana, p.274 The real significance of the case in later centuries lay in the principle that was extracted from the judges' arguments about how the common recovery worked, though many commentators got the details (and name) of the case itself wrong, having never seen the Plea Roll. Most authorities simply followed Sir Edward Coke, who stated that the common recovery began with \\"Taltarum's Case\\". It is now clear, however, that as a legal device, the common recovery predated 1472, possibly first appearing in the 1440s: Taltarum's Case added little beyond introducing, through the judges' deliberations, the device of the \\"double voucher\\", though this did not become part of the common recovery until the mid 16th century.Biancalana, p.261 Nevertheless it seems likely that the example of Taltarum's Case served to popularise the procedure, as the annual number of recoveries was far greater in the decade after 1472 than in the previous decade.Biancalana, p.261 References Category:Court of Common Pleas (England) cases Category:1470s in law Category:English land case law Category:1472 in England ","title":"Taltarum's Case"},{"id":"43095022","title":"Tonight (We Live Forever)"},{"id":"43095030","text":"Karl Salb (born May 19, 1949) is a retired American shot putter.

Very little is known about his origin and early life. John Skylitzes and Theophanes Continuatus (as well as Zonaras, who follows them) report that he was originally a simple rower in one of the emperor's personal ships, but this may well be later fabrication to disparage him. Theophanes Constinuatus also reports that he was the brother of Constantine Kapnogenes, who later became Eparch of the City. Emperor Michael III and \\"Basilikinos\\" in imperial garb, from the Madrid Skylitzes By 866, Basiliskianos had risen to the rank of patrikios, and was serving in the imperial household (koiton), being one of Emperor Michael III's close companions. On 1 September of that year, after a chariot race at the palace of Saint Mamas (in modern Be≈üikta≈ü), Basiliskianos congratulated the emperor so fulsomely on his victory that, according to the chroniclers, the delighted Michael ordered him to take from his own feet the red imperial boots (tzangia) and put them on himself. This provoked the displeasure of Michael's co-emperor Basil the Macedonian, a man of humble origin who had risen to power through his own close relationship with Michael. Michael, seeing Basil's disapproval, became angry, and threatened to make Basiliskianos co-emperor in Basil's place. The rift between Michael and his erstwhile prot√©g√© widened thereafter, and on 24 September 867, when Michael retired drunk to his quarters at Saint Mamas, Basil and eight of his supporters moved to kill the emperor. The protovestiarios Rendakios, who normally slept before the emperor's bedroom, was absent, and Basiliskianos took his place on that night. When Basil and his co-conspirators barged into the bedchamber, Basiliskianos tried to oppose them but was wounded and thrown aside. After the conspirators killed Michael, they rowed down the Bosporus back to Constantinople, where Basil was hastily crowned sole emperor, inaugurating the Macedonian dynasty. Nothing further is known of Basiliskianos after that.

Apart from the main building, several annexes and a garden belong to the estate. The main building has undergone several renovations but is a fine example of 1800s upper-class accommodation, with magnificent murals. The estate has recently undergone a major renovation. Six buildings have new roofs and three have been prepared for rental.  History  The estate dates from the Middle Ages. The first known owner was Peder Fleming, who bought the farm in 1652. In the late 18th century, Katthamra was acquired by merchant andshipbuilder Jacob Dubbe (1769-1844). Among the owners of the house were Nils Ihre, ancestor of philologist and historical linguist Johan Ihre (1707‚Äì1780). In the early 19th century, the farm was sold to Axel H√§gg, whose descendants owned the farm for 150 years. Best known were architect and artist Axel Herman H√§gg (1835- 1921) and his brother Admiral Jacob H√§gg (1839-1931). Katthamra is an unusual example of a manor house on Gotland, where such buildings are uncommon. During the 18th and 19th centuries the owners of the estate earned a lot of money from limestone extraction. The main building dates largely from the 18th century but was originally much smaller. The presently visible main building was enlarged in 1805 into the presently visible Neoclassical building. It is a two-storey house with a hip roof. Above the main entrance there is a statue of Diana. The house has some profusely painted interiors, made by artist Jonas Torss√©n.

He was a Member of Parliament for Buckingham, 1817‚Äì1818, Fowey, 1818‚Äì1819, and Dartmouth, 1822‚Äì1825. Biography He was the third and youngest son of Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope. Stanhope was joined in the British Army at the age of 15, contrary to his father's wishes, but by the advice and influence of William Pitt the Younger; who was 3rd Earl's second cousin, by the marriage of his grandfather, the 1st Earl, to Lucy, sister of Robert Pitt of Boconnock (the Minister's grandfather). He entered the British Army as Ensign in the 1st Foot Guards, 26 December 1805; was promoted Lieutenant and Captain, 14 January 1808; brevet Major, 21 June 1813; and Captain and Lieutenant-Colonel in the 1st Foot Guards, 25 July 1814. Stanhope served in Spain, Portugal, Flanders and France. He served as on the staff of General Sir John Moore as an aide-de- camp in 1809. He acted as extra aid-de-camp to Lord Lynedock (1810‚Äì1814). In 1812 was appointed a Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General, and in 1813 as Assistant Quarter Master General in the Peninsula. During the storming of San Sebastian in late August early September 1813, Stanhope received a grape-shot wound in the spine. The opinion of the surgeons by whom he was attended, was that the ball could not, without imminent risk of fatal consequences, be extracted, so it remained lodged in place and caused him immense suffering for the rest of his life. He remained in the army and in 1815 served as an assistant adjacent to Duke of Wellington during the Waterloo Campaign and took part in the Battle of Waterloo and the subsequent the march upon Paris. From 1815 until he died he was aid-de-camp to Prince Frederick. Stanhope was first elected to parliament in 1817; he was returned for Fowey at the general election in 1818, but was not re-chosen in 1820. In that year he was, by the will of Sir Joseph Banks, appointed one of his four executors. Stanhope re- entered the House of Commons in early in 1822 as M.P. for Dartmouth, and continued so until his death. Marriage and death On 9 July 1820, Stanhope married Frederica-Louisa, eldest daughter of David William, 3rd Earl Mansfield. She gave birth to one son, James Stanhope, but died on 14 January 1823. Greatly afflicted at the death of his wife Stanhope gave up his establishment in South Audley Street in London and moved into Kenwood House, the seat of his father-in-law. In 1825 Stanhope was still very depressed over the loss of his wife and continued to suffer physical discomfort from the wound he had received in Spain twelve years earlier. He had appeared very abstracted, and was in the habit of sitting a long time, as if in a state of stupor, and then he would suddenly start up, as if from sleep or upon an alarm. A few days before his death on 5 March, he had complained very much that be could get no sleep, in consequence of the pain he endured. Afflicted in his melancholy manner, whilst walking in the park at some distance from the house, he entered a shed, formed to shelter the cattle, and suspended himself with his braces from a beam. His body was not discovered till some hours after, when, the household being alarmed, a general search was in progress. A Coroner's jury gave a verdict of \\"temporary insanity\\".

Here he is depicted with ten arms and accompanied by a goddess. Mahaganapati (, ), literally \\"Ganesha, the Great\\"), also spelled as Maha Ganapati is an aspect of the Hindu god Ganesha. He is the representation of Ganesha as the Supreme Being Paramatman and is the most important deity of the Ganesha-centric Ganapatya sect. He is one of the most popular of the thirty-two forms of Ganesha, worshipped as the ultimate truth Para brahman. Iconography Like all aspects of Ganesha, Mahaganapati has an elephant head. Sindoor, is generally used for his red colour, in depictions. His colour is a reference to the dawn. He is often depicted with a third eye on his forehead, a crescent moon over his head, ten arms which hold; a lotus, a pomegranate fruit, a gada (mace), a chakra (discus), his own broken tusk, a pasha (noose), a jewelled water vessel or a pot of jewels, a blue lotus, a rice sprig and a sugarcane bow.Subramuniyaswami p. 71Rao p. 55 An alternate depiction replaces the pomegranate with a mango and the gada with a shankha (conch) and elaborates that the jewelled pot contains amrita (ambrosia). Yet another description suggests that the objects in his ten hands are gifts from other deities and symbolize his powers to perform the tasks of all deities and his supremacy over the pantheon. He sometimes holds a citron fruit with numerous seeds, a symbol of the power of creation and a representation the god Shiva. The sugarcane bow is associated with Kamadeva, the god of love; while the rice paddy functions as an arrow bestowed by the Earth goddess Prithvi; both symbols of fertility. The chakra is a common weapon of Vishnu, while the gada represents his boar avatar, Varaha. The jewelled pot ‚Äì which may be depicted in his trunk ‚Äì denotes Kubera, the god of wealth. It also represents the fortune and blessings bestowed by Mahaganapati on his devotees. Rao classifies Mahaganapati as one of the five Shakti-Ganesha icons, where Ganesha is depicted with a shakti, that is, a female consort.Rao p. 53 A white- complexioned shakti sits on his left lap. She holds a lotus (a symbol of purity) in her left hand and hugs the god with her other hand. In the Dasboddhi Ganesha temple in Mathura, the shakti with Mahaganapati is identified as Mahalakshmi, the \\"great\\" Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and fortune.Brown p. 134 A text calls her Pushti (\\"nourishment\\"). The left hand of the god holds a blue lotus and embraces the goddess. Various deities and demons surround the god. Worship Mahaganapati represents Ganesha as the Supreme Being and thus the most important deity of the Ganapatya sect, which accords the status of the Supreme God to Ganesha. He is a widely worshipped and widely depicted form of Ganesha.Grewal pp. 120‚Äì1 The icon symbolizes happiness, wealth and magnificence of Ganesha. Mahaganapati is the patron of the Maha-ganapatya sect, one of the six chief schools of the Ganapatyas. They regard Mahaganapati as the great Creator. Mahaganapati is believed to have existed before the creation of the universe and will exist after its dissolution (pralaya). He creates the god Brahma, who aids in creation of the universe and all other beings. One who meditates on this form of Ganesha is said to obtain Supreme Bliss.Bhandarkar p. 213 In a Tantric context, Mahaganapati is associated with six rituals of abhichara (uses of spells for malevolent purposes) by which the adept can cause the target to suffer delusions, be overcome with irresistible attraction or envy, or to be enslaved, paralysed or killed.Grewal pp. 122‚Äì3 Mahaganapati is enshrined in the Ranjangaon Ganpati temple, one of the eight Ashtavinayak temples. According to local legend, Mahaganapati had aided his father Shiva to fight the demon Tripurasura. Shiva had forgotten to pay his respects to Mahaganapati before starting the battle against the demon. An enraged Mahaganapati caused Shiva's chariot to fail. Shiva realized his mistake and paid his respects to his son and then was successful in defeating the demon.Grewal pp. 133‚Äì4 Notes References  * * Category:Forms of Ganesha ","title":"Mahaganapati"},{"id":"43095186","text":"Corridos Canta is the fourth full-length album released by the New Mexican musician Al Hurricane in 1973?.

Missions =2014 mission in the Central Mediterranean= The Migration Offshore Aid Station inaugurated its first twenty-day mission on Monday 25 August 2014. It set sail from Malta‚Äôs Grand Harbour at around noon after a press conference held at the Birgu Marina. In the evening, as it returned close to Malta to pick up some equipment, the Phoenix came about a very worried Maltese fisherman whose boat was drifting off Delimara (close to Marsaxlokk) after its engine failed. The man managed to attract the attention of the MOAS crew by waving. The three-metre boat was tied up alongside the Phoenix until help was called. MOAS organised its first migrant rescue on 30 August when it assisted a group of 250 Syrians and Palestinians, including 40 children. On the same day, the Phoenix also assisted some 96 Sub-Saharan migrants from a rubber dinghy who were transferred onto a merchant ship. On 8 September, the Phoenix conducted two rescues involving almost 700 migrants, including 83 women and children. A two-day old infant was among the people saved. A day later, another 500 migrants were rescued from two separate vessels, bringing the tally up to 1,500 migrants saved in less than two weeks at sea. MOAS rescued another 1,500 migrants throughout October, bringing the total number of lives saved to 3,000. MOAS launched its crowdfunding effort in October and by 2015 had already raised some $70,000. In February 2015, MOAS made a specific appeal to the maritime industry and mariners who are required to respond to emergencies. It said that seafarers transiting the Mediterranean would be especially affected by the numbers of refugees crossing from Libya to Italy after projects like the Italian mission Mare Nostrum were no longer in operation. =2015 mission in the Central Mediterranean= MOAS continued to operate in the Central Mediterranean Sea between May and September 2015, during which time it assisted almost 9,000 refugees, bringing its total number of lives saved until the end of 2015 to 12,000. Doctors Without Borders partnered with MOAS from May to September 2015 on board the MY Phoenix where they cared for 6,985 people rescued at sea after rescue by MOAS.

Due to his close contacts to South-East-Asia many of them come from Asian countries.  Research activities  Bernd M. Rode‚Äôs scientific achievements are reflected in seven monographies / books, more than 440 publications in international research journals and 30 book contributions. According to ISI Thomson's Web of Science citation report these contributions received more than 8300 citations (as of May 2014) with a Hirsch-index of 41. Prof. Rode's research focus lies in Theoretical and Computational as well as Bioinorganic Chemistry. In detail his publications emphasise on the following aspects: * Quantum chemical calculations of molecular and supermolecular systems, * Ab initio Monte Carlo and MD simulations of liquids / solutions, * Electrolyte solution structure, * Ultrafast Dynamics of solutes, * Molecular Modelling of biomolecules and drugs, * QSAR / QSPR, * Chemical Evolution of Peptides/ Proteins and Origin of Life = Theoretical chemistry = Example of a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulation of aqueous Sn(II) performed by Rode et al.Hofer, Thomas; Pribil, Andreas; Randolf, Bernhard; Rode, Bernd M. (2005); \\"Structure and dynamics of solvated Sn(II) in aqueous solution - an ab initio QM/MM MD approach\\", J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127(41), pp. 14231‚Äì14238. DOI:10.1021/ja052700f Oxygen atoms of first shell molecules are shown in red. The influence of the lone electron pair of Sn(II) on the hydration structure is clearly visible. Although Prof. Rode's initial research activities were in field of inorganic chemistry, he soon extended his expertise into the rapidly developing field of theoretical and computational chemistry. Whereas in the beginning most studies focused on quantum chemical computations of a broad range of chemical systems, later application focused on the application of chemical simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, mostly in the context of solution chemistry. A particular notable contribution of Prof. Rode's research is the development and application of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulation techniques, focusing on a broad range of problems in solution chemistry. In 2004 an improved technique known as quantum mechanical charge field molecular dynamics explicitly aimed at the treatment of solvated systems has been developed in Prof. Rode's research group. During the last years the application of this technique enabled accurate simulations of ionic compounds and organic species as well as coordination complexes in aqueous solution. His most recent research is focussed on the lanthanoid ions in aqueous solution. = Chemical evolution = Structure of the salt induced peptide formation complex with one chelating and one end-on coordinated glycine ligand, one chloride ligand and two axial water molecules obtained via energy minimization at Hartree-Fock level in implicit solvent.Jakschitz, Thomas; Fitz, Daniel; Rode, Bernd Michael (2012); \\"The origin of first peptides on earth: from amino acids to homochiral biomolecules\\"; In: Genesis - In The Beginning, Joseph Seckbach (Eds.), , Springer, Dordrecht 2012, pp. 469‚Äì489. Prof. Rode's second main field of research lies in the area of bioinorganic chemistry, in particular abiogenesis. At the end of the 1980s Prof. Rode and his coworkers discovered the salt induced peptide formation reaction as a simple route to synthesis peptides from amino acid monomers under prebiotic conditions. Instead of enzymes transition metals act as catalyst to induce peptide formation in highly concentrated aqueous NaCl solution, with copper (II) showing the highest catalytic activity. Typically, evaporation cycle experiments have been carried out to mimic day/night cycles on shore and in lagoons, thereby generating supersaturated solutions. Since such solutions have a tendency to dilute themselves, the thermodynamic and kinetic unfavourable peptide formation reaction is promoted. The research conducted by Prof. Rode investigates the properties of the salt induced peptide formation reaction under various conditions, highlighting also its possible connection to biohomochirality. Furthermore, Prof. Rode also carried out Miller-Urey experiments, taking new insights of the composition of the primordial atmosphere into account. It was shown that peptides may also form in a neutral atmosphere (CO2/N2/H2O) subject to electric discharges. = Molvision¬Æ = The Molvision¬Æ Logo Together with his Ph.D. student Hung Tung Tran Prof. Rode developed the practical and flexible visualization software Molvision¬Æ capable of interactively analyzing dynamic simulation data. In 2003 Dr. Tran was awarded with a European Innovation Award for the development of this program.  Publications  *Tongraar, A.; Liedl, K. R.; Rode, Bernd M.

Early life ≈Ωak was born in Rijeka, Croatia. He graduated from Music high school in Rijeka, finishing the course of violin and viola. In addition to that he is also a multi-instrumentalist. ≈Ωak has learned vocal technics from his mother Petja Todorova - Tataj, famous piano player and vocal educationalist. Career ≈Ωak has started his rich music career in mid 80's in famous Rijeka's band Jersey. They've recorded their first album, Pustite Da ≈Ωivim, for Yugoslav discography label Jugoton. They had numerous concerts all around Yugoslavia, and have received many different awards from various rock festivals. Between 1988 and 1991 he played a viola in opera orchestre of HNK Ivan Zajc. In the beginning of the 1990s Jersey had stopped performing, because ≈Ωak was, known for his great vocal abilities, invited to perform with legendary rock band Divlje Jagode (Wild Strawberries). They've recorded album Magic Love, which was, because of intention of being published on the European market, sung in English. Because of the war in Yugoslavia, Divlje Jagode stopped performing and therefore ≈Ωak has started working with the Slovenian band Mary Rose. They've recorded album called Pleasure & Pain, but because of the fire blast in studio Tivoli, the album never saw the light of the day. Mary Rose then stopped performing for some years. In the beginning of 1994, ≈Ωak has contributed on the joint project of the famous European rock bands Helloween and Gamma Ray. He also worked with Zoran ≈†erbed≈æija, ex-guitarist of Crvena Jabuka on the project \\"Madcap Laf\\" in Germany. In 1995 and 1996 he worked as an instrumentalist and vocalist on two albums of Slovenian band Turbo, called The Power Of Metal and A Glimpse Of Home. In the second half of 1995 he founded a band in Croatia called Aqua, with whom he recorded a self- titled album. He returned to Divlje Jagode with the concert Final top 1000 in Stuttgart. This concert was broadcast by SDR 3, MTV and other European TV and radio stations. With Divlje Jagode he recorded an album Sto Vjekova and successfully performed all over Europe until 1999. In 1999 he recorded his first solo album and with few songs performed on festivals like Neumski and Splitski. At the end of 1999 he published his symphonic album, titled Bo≈æiƒáne Pjesme(Christmas Songs). In the beginning of 2000 he started performing with two Slovenian cover bands, ƒårna Gradnja and Ambasada. Due to the urge for making original authors music, he and guitarist Eki Alilovski refounded Mary Rose in 2004. As the result of this work, they have released a new album titled Feniks, in 2006. In 2006, he also founded a jazzy band Norne with famous Rijeka's vocalist, where ≈Ωak is playing a bass guitar. This band performs various songs in various languages and is getting ready for concerts and possible album. In 2013 he joined Slovenian heavy metal band Black Diamond, after the release of their first album Last Man Standing, on which he sang most of the songs. At the moment he is also working as a vocal coach in music school Studio Maraton. In 2019 ≈Ωak founded a new band which performs under his name ≈Ωanil Tataj - ≈Ωak. In 2019 they've released singles Prosule se divlje jagode and [ Ti≈°ina] 2019 is also a year when Mary Rose, after years of health difficulties of some of their members, finally released new album Resniƒçen Svet. Album was released on May 17, followed by a spectalural promotional concert in Postojna, Slovenia. This concert is hoped and expected to be an announcement of great come back of one of Slovenia's most legendary bands.

It was demolished by the Greek authorities in 1874, on the initiative and with funding from Heinrich Schliemann. Location and appearance The tower was situated on the western corner of the Acropolis, next to the Propylaea, but probably did not communicate directly with them, as paintings and photographs from the 19th century show the entrance above ground, on the tower's eastern face at the second-floor level, some above the architrave of the Propylaea. Literary sources attest to the fact that the door was accessible by means of an external wooden staircase. On the other hand, a couple of photographs also show a ground entrance on the western side, which means that the lower portion of the tower was probably separate from the upper, and used as a prison or storage room. The tower was built of stone from the quarries of Penteli and Piraeus, making heavy use of material from the ancient buildings of the Acropolis. It was square in shape, long and wide, and its walls had a thickness of at their base. With a height of , its top, accessible through a wooden staircase, held a commanding view over the central plain of Attica and the surrounding mountains. The north side of the tower had a small, square turret that projected from the wall, atop which \\"beacon-fires could be kindled which would be visible from Acrocorinth\\" in the Peloponnese. Old sketches from the late 17th century on also show that the tower was crenellated. History Close-up view of the tower The date of construction is unclear, and following its demolition now impossible to reconstruct with any certainty. Construction is usually ascribed to the Acciaioli family, who ruled the Duchy of Athens between 1388 and its fall to the Ottoman Empire in 1458, since it was they who converted the Propylaea complex into a palace. However, according to medievalist Peter Lock, the tower \\"might equally be ascribed\\" to the first dynasty of Frankish dukes of Athens, the 13th-century de la Roche, who also had a residence on the site, of which no details are known. The tower may be the inspiration for the \\"grete tour\\" in the palace of the Duke of Athens, where Palamon is imprisoned in Chaucer's The Knight's Tale. Under Ottoman rule the tower‚Äîknown locally as Goulas or Koulas (ŒìŒøœÖŒªŒ¨œÇ/ŒöŒøœÖŒªŒ¨œÇ, from Turkish kule, \\"tower\\")‚Äîwas used as a salt store and a prison. When the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821, twelve Athenian notables were imprisoned here by the Ottoman authorities as hostages, of whom nine were executed during the 1821‚Äì1822 siege of the Acropolis by the Greek rebels and three managed to escape. In 1825, the Greek military leader Odysseas Androutsos was imprisoned at the tower by his political rivals, tortured and finally killed. The tower was dismantled in 1874, as part of a wider cleaning-up of the Acropolis from post-Classical buildings, a project initiated and financed by Heinrich Schliemann. The demolition of such an \\"integral part of the Athenian horizon\\" (Th√©ophile Gautier) drew considerable criticism at the time. Work began on 2 July, amid great publicity organised by Schliemann, but a few days later the demolition was halted at the order of King George I, prompting Schliemann to write an indignant letter of protest to the King. Despite the latter's opposition, the tower was eventually torn down. The eminent historian of Frankish Greece William Miller later called it \\"an act of vandalism unworthy of any people imbued with a sense of the continuity of history\\", and \\"pedantic barbarism\\".

An attacker balances or reduces one or two of those parameters in favor of the other one or two. This type of attack is very hard and most of the ciphers and encryption schemes were not designed to resist such type of attack. This attack is a special type of the general cryptanalytic time/memory tradeoff attack.  History  Tradeoff attacks on symmetric cryptosystems dates back to 1980 when Hellman suggested a time/memory tradeoff method to break block ciphers with N possible keys in time T and memory M related by the tradeoff curve T{M^2}={N^2} where 1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq N.Hellman, M.E., \\"A cryptanalytic time-memory trade-off,\\" Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on , vol.26, no.4, pp.401,406, Jul 1980 Later, Babbage and Golic devised a different tradeoff attack for stream ciphers with a new bound such that TM=N for 1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq D and D is the output data available to the cryptanalyst at real time.Babbage, S. H., \\"Improved ‚Äúexhaustive search‚Äù attacks on stream ciphers,\\" Security and Detection, 1995., European Convention on , vol., no., pp.161-166, 16‚Äì18 May 1995Golic, J., \\"Cryptanalysis of Alleged A5 Stream Cipher\\" Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Advances in Cryptology ‚Äî EUROCRYPT ‚Äô97, LNCS 1233, pp.239-255, Springer-Verlag 1997  Attack mechanics  This attack is a special type of the general cryptanalytic time/memory tradeoff attack. A general time/memory tradeoff attack has two main phases: # Preprocessing: ::During this phase, the attacker explores the structure of the cryptosystem and is allowed to record his or her findings in large tables. This can take a long time. # Realtime: ::In this phase, the cryptanalyst is granted real data obtained from a specific unknown key. He or she tries to use the precomputed table from the preprocessing phase to find the particular in as little time as possible. Any time/memory/data tradeoff attack has the following parameters: :N search space size :P time required for the preprocessing phase :T time required for the realtime phase :M amount of memory available to the attacker :D amount of realtime data available to the attacker  Hellman's tradeoff attack on block ciphers  For block ciphers, N is the total number of possible keys and also assume the number of possible plaintexts and ciphertexts to be N. Also let the given data be a single ciphertext block of a specific plaintext counterpart. If we consider the mapping from the key x to the ciphertext y as a random permutation function f over an N point space, and if this function f is invertible; we need to find the inverse of this function {f}^{-1}(y)=x. Hellman's technique to invert this function: :During the preprocessing stage :Try to cover the N point space by an m \\\\times t rectangular matrix that is constructed by iterating the function f on m random starting points in N for t times. The start points are the leftmost column in the matrix and the end points are the rightmost column. Then store the pairs of start and end points in increasing order of end points values. Hellman's Matrix :Now, only one matrix will not be able to cover the whole N space. But if we add more rows to the matrix we will end up with a huge matrix that includes recovered points more than once. So we find the critical value of m at which the matrix contains exactly m different points. Consider the first m paths from start points to end points are all disjoint with mt points, such that the next path which has at least one common point with one of those previous paths and includes exactly t points. Those two sets of mt and t points are disjoint by the birthday paradox if we make sure that t \\\\sdot mt \\\\leq N. We achieve this by enforcing the matrix stopping rule: m{t}^2=N. :Nevertheless, an m \\\\times t matrix with m{t}^2=N covers a portion mt/N=1/t of the whole space. To generate t to cover the whole space, we use a variant of f defined: {f}_{i}(x)={h}_{i}(f(x)) and {h}_{i} is simple out manipulation such as reordering of bits of f(x) (refer to the original paper for more details). And one can see that the total preprocessing time is P \\\\approx N. Also M=mt since we only need to store the pairs of start and end points and we have t matrices each of m pairs. :During the real time phase :The total computation required to find f^{-1}(y) is T=t^{2} because we need to do t inversion attempts as it is likely to be covered by one matrix and each of the attempts takes t evaluations of some f_{i}. The optimum tradeoff curve is obtained by using the matrix stopping rule m{t}^2=N and we get T{M^2}={N^2}, P=N, D=1 and choice of T and M depends on the cost of each resource. According to Hellman, if the block cipher at hand has the property that the mapping from its key to cipher text is a random permutation function f over an N point space, and if this f is invertible, the tradeoff relationship becomes ways better: TM=N.  Babbage-and-Golic tradeoff attack on stream ciphers  For stream ciphers, N is specified by the number of internal states of the bit generator - probably different from the number of keys. D is the count of the first pseudorandom bits produced from the generator. Finally, the attacker goal is to find one of the actual internal states of the bit generator to be able to run the generator from this point on to generate the rest of the key. Associate each of the possible N internal states of the bit generator with the corresponding string that consists of the first log(N) bits obtained by running the generator from that state by the mapping f(x)=y from states x to output prefixes y. This previous mapping is considered a random function over the N points common space. To invert this function, an attacker establishes the following. #During the preprocessing phase, pick M random {x}_i states and compute their corresponding {y}_i output prefixes. #Store the pairs ({x}_i,{y}_i) in increasing order of {y}_i in a large table. #During the realtime phase, you have D+log(N)-1 generated bits. Calculate from them all D possible combinations of {y}_1,{y}_2,...,{y}_D, of consecutive bits with length log(N). #Search for each {y}_i in the generated table which takes log time. #If you have a hit, this {y}_i corresponds to an internal state {x}_i of the bit generator from which you can forward run the generator to obtain the rest of the key. #By the Birthday Paradox, you are guaranteed that two subsets of a space with N points have an intersection if their sizes product is greater than N. This result from the Birthday attack gives the condition DM=N with attack time T=D and preprocessing time P=M which is just a particular point on the tradeoff curve TM=N. We can generalize this relation if we ignore some of the available data at real time and we are able to reduce T from T=D to 1 and the general tradeoff curve eventually becomes TM=N with 1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq D and P=M.  Time/memory/data tradeoff attack by A. Shamir and A. Biryukov on stream ciphers Biryukov A., Shamir A., \\"Cryptanalytic Time/Memory/Data Tradeoffs for Stream Ciphers\\" Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Advances in Cryptology ‚Äî ASIACRYPT 2000, LNCS 1976, pp.1-13, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2000  This novel idea introduced in 2000 combines Hellman tradeoff and Babbage-and-Golic tradeoff attacks to achieve a new tradeoff curve with better bounds for stream ciphers cryptoanalysis. Hellman's block cipher technique can be applied to a stream cipher by using the same idea of covering the N points space through matrices obtained from multiple variants f_{i} of the function f which is the mapping of internal states to output prefixes. Recall that this tradeoff attack on stream cipher is successful if any of the given D output prefixes is found in any of the matrices covering N. This cuts the number of covered points by the matrices from N to N/D points. This is done by reducing the number of matrices from t to t/D while keeping m as large as possible (but this requires t \\\\geq D to have at least one table). For this new attack, we have M=mt/D because we reduced the number of matrices to t/D and the same for the preprocessing time P=N/D. The realtime required for the attack is T=(t/D) \\\\sdot t \\\\sdot D=t^{2} which is the product of the number of matrices, length of each iteration and number of available data points at attack time. Eventually, we again use the matrix stopping rule to obtain the tradeoff curve TM^{2}D^{2}=t^{2}\\\\sdot (m^{2}t^{2}/D^{2})\\\\sdot D^{2}=m^{2}t^{4}=N^{2} for D^{2}\\\\leq T\\\\leq N (because t\\\\geq D). = Tradeoff attacks on stream ciphers with low sampling resistance Biryukov A., Shamir A., Wagner D., \\"Real Time Cryptanalysis of A5/1 on a PC\\" Fast Software Encryption 2000, pp.1-18, Springer-Verlag 2000 = This attack was invented by Biryukov, Shamir, Wagner. The idea relies on the following feature of various stream ciphers: the bit generator undergoes only few changes in its internal state before producing the next output bit. Therefore, we can enumerate those special states that generate k zero bits for small values of k at low cost. But when forcing large number of output bits to take specific values, this enumeration process become very expensive and difficult. Now, we can define the sampling resistance of a stream cipher to be R=2^{-k} with k the maximum value which makes such enumeration feasible. Let the stream cipher be of N=2^{n} states each has a full name of n bits and a corresponding output name which is the first n bits in the output sequence of bits. If this stream cipher has sampling resistance R=2^{-k}, then an efficient enumeration can use a short name of n-k bits to define the special states of the generator. Each special state with n-k short name has a corresponding short output name of n-k bits which is the output sequence of the special state after removing the first k leading bits. Now, we are able to define a new mapping over a reduced space of NR=2^{n-k} points and this mapping is equivalent to the original mapping. If we let DR\\\\geq 1, the realtime data available to the attacker is guaranteed to have at least one output of those special states. Otherwise, we relax the definition of special states to include more points. If we substitute for D by DR and N by NR in the new time/memory/data tradeoff attack by Shamir and Biryukov, we obtain the same tradeoff curve TM^{2}D^{2}=N^{2} but with (DR)^{2}\\\\leq T\\\\leq NR. This is actually an improvement since we could relax the lower bound on T since (DR)^{2} can be small up to 1 which means that our attack can be made faster. This technique reduces the number of expensive disk access operations from t to tR since we will be accessing only the special DR points, and makes the attack faster because of the reduced number of expensive disk operations.

This house is located on the west side of the cluster, just south of the Daniel Pinkham House and west of the Phoebe Hart House. It is a three-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, two interior chimneys, and a clapboarded exterior, and is oriented facing west. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance sheltered by a Greek Revival portico with Corinthian columns. Its windows are framed by Federal-period eared moulding. The interior includes a Georgian-style central stair, with an arched Georgian window above the landing. Some of the fireplace surrounds reflect Federal and Greek Revival restylings. When first built in the mid-18th century, this house was a two-story wood frame structure. Early in the 18th century a third floor was added, and it was given extensive Federal-style treatment. These alterations included the replacement of original Georgian windows with long windows with eared surrounds. In the 1830s the Greek Revival portico was added, and Victorian fireplaces were also added. Additions were originally in place on the rear of the house, and in the 20th century it had been adapted for use as a nursing home. It was moved to its present location as part of a redevelopment project, and presently houses commercial offices.

Infection Infection of a tumor or its surrounding tissue can cause rapidly escalating pain, but is sometimes overlooked as a possible cause. One study found that infection was the cause of pain in four percent of nearly 300 cancer patients referred for pain relief. Another report described seven patients, whose previously well-controlled pain escalated significantly over several days. Antibiotic treatment produced pain relief in all patients within three days. Tumor-related Tumors can cause pain by crushing or infiltrating tissue, or by releasing chemicals that make nociceptors responsive to stimuli that are normally non-painful (cf. allodynia). =Vascular events= ;Deep vein thrombosis :Between 15 and 25 percent of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein). Cancers most likely to cause DVT are pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, brain tumors, advanced breast cancer and advanced pelvic tumors. DVT may be the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain (which varies from intense to vague cramp or \\"heaviness\\") in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. ;Superior vena cava syndrome :The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, most often non-small-cell lung carcinoma (50 percent), small-cell lung carcinoma (25 percent), lymphoma, or metastasis, causing superior vena cava syndrome. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling of the face and neck, dilation of veins in the neck and chest, and chest wall pain. =Nervous system= Between 40 and 80 percent of patients with cancer pain experience neuropathic pain. Brain :Brain tissue itself contains no nociceptors; brain tumors cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain- sensitive tissue. Meninges :Ten percent of patients with cancer spreading to different parts of the body develop meningeal carcinomatosis, where metastatic seedlings develop in the meninges (outer lining) of both the brain and spinal cord (with possible invasion of the brain or spinal cord). Melanoma and breast and lung cancer account for 90 percent of such cases. Back pain and headache ‚Äì often severe and possibly associated with nausea, vomiting, neck rigidity and pain or discomfort in the eyes due to light exposure (photophobia) ‚Äì are frequently the first symptoms of meningeal carcinomatosis. \\"Pins and needles\\" (paresthesia), bowel or bladder dysfunction and lower motor neuron weakness are common features. Fig. 1: A human vertebra showing body and pedicle Spinal cord compression :About three percent of cancer patients experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the vertebral body or pedicle (fig. 1) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the vertebral body. Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces funicular pain and compression of a spinal nerve root (fig. 5) produces radicular pain. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the lumbar, and 10 percent the cervical spine; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on the location of the compression. Nerve infiltration or compression :Infiltration or compression of a nerve by a primary tumor causes peripheral neuropathy in one to five percent of cancer patients. Dorsal root ganglion inflammation :Small-cell lung cancer and, less often, cancer of the breast, colon or ovary may produce inflammation of the dorsal root ganglia (fig. 5), precipitating burning, tingling pain in the extremities, with occasional \\"lightning\\" or lancinating pains. Brachial plexopathy :Brachial plexopathy is a common product of Pancoast tumor, lymphoma and breast cancer, and can produce severe burning dysesthesic pain on the back of the hand, and cramping, crushing forearm pain. =Bone= Fig. 2: Cross-section of the human head showing the nasopharynx Invasion of bone by cancer is the most common source of cancer pain. About 70 percent of breast and prostate cancer patients, and 40 percent of those with lung, kidney and thyroid cancers develop bone metastases. It is commonly felt as tenderness, with constant background pain and instances of spontaneous or movement-related exacerbation, and is frequently described as severe. Tumors in the marrow instigate a vigorous immune response which enhances pain sensitivity, and they release chemicals that stimulate nociceptors. As they grow, tumors compress, consume, infiltrate or cut off blood supply to body tissues, which can cause pain. Fracture :Rib fractures, common in breast, prostate and other cancers with rib metastases, can cause brief severe pain on twisting the trunk, coughing, laughing, breathing deeply or moving between sitting and lying. In breast, prostate or lung cancer, multiple myeloma and some other cancers, sudden onset limb or back pain may indicate pathological bone fracture (most often in the upper femur). Skull :The base of the skull may be affected by metastases from cancer of the bronchus, breast or prostate, or cancer may spread directly to this area from the nasopharynx (fig. 2), and this may cause headache, facial paresthesia, dysesthesia or pain, or cranial nerve dysfunction ‚Äì the exact symptoms depend on the cranial nerves impacted. =Pelvis= Pain produced by cancer within the pelvis varies depending on the affected tissue, but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper thigh, and may refer to the lumbar region. Lumbosacral plexopathy is often caused by recurrence of cancer in the presacral space, and may refer to the external genitalia or perineum. Local recurrence of cancer attached to the side of the pelvic wall may cause pain in one of the iliac fossae. Pain on walking that confines the patient to bed indicates possible cancer adherence to or invasion of the iliacus muscle. Pain in the hypogastrium (between the navel and pubic bone) is often found in cancers of the uterus and bladder, and sometimes in colorectal cancer especially if infiltrating or attached to either uterus or bladder. =Viscera= Visceral pain is diffuse and difficult to locate, and is often referred to more distant, usually superficial, sites. Liver :Acute hemorrhage into a hepatocellular carcinoma causes severe upper right quadrant pain, and may be life-threatening, requiring emergency surgery or other emergency intervention. A tumor can expand the size of the liver several times and consequent stretching of its capsule can cause aching pain in the right hypochondrium. Other causes of pain in enlarged liver are traction of the supporting ligaments when standing or walking, the liver pressing against the rib cage or pinching the wall of the abdomen, and straining the lumbar spine. In some postures the liver may pinch the parietal peritoneum against the lower rib cage, producing sharp, transitory pain, relieved by changing position. The tumor may also infiltrate the liver's capsule, causing dull, and sometimes stabbing pain. Kidneys and spleen :Cancer of the kidneys and spleen produces less pain than that caused by liver tumor ‚Äì kidney tumors eliciting pain only once the organ has been almost totally destroyed and the cancer has invaded the surrounding tissue or adjacent pelvis. Pressure on the kidney or ureter from a tumor outside the kidney can cause extreme flank pain. Local recurrence of cancer after the removal of a kidney can cause pain in the lumbar back, or L1 or L2 spinal nerve pain in the groin or upper thigh, accompanied by weakness and numbness of the iliopsoas muscle, exacerbated by activity. Abdominal and urogenital hollow organs :Inflammation of artery walls and tissue adjacent to nerves is common in tumors of abdominal and urogenital hollow organs. Infection or cancer may irritate the trigone of the urinary bladder, causing spasm of the detrusor urinae muscle (the muscle that squeezes urine from the urinary bladder), resulting in deep pain above the pubic bone, possibly referred to the tip of the penis, lasting from a few minutes to half an hour. Gastrointestinal :The pain of intestinal tumors may be the result of disturbed motility, dilation, altered blood flow or ulceration. Malignant lymphomas of the gastrointestinal tract can produce large tumors with significant ulceration and bleeding. Respiratory system :Cancer in the bronchial tree is usually painless, but ear and facial pain on one side of the head has been reported in some patients. This pain is referred via the auricular branch of the vagus nerve.Fig. 3 The pancreas: 1. pancreatic head; 4. pancreatic body; 11. pancreatic tail Pancreas :Ten percent of patients with cancer of the pancreatic body or tail experience pain, whereas 90 percent of those with cancer of the pancreatic head will, especially if the tumor is near the hepatopancreatic ampulla. The pain appears on the left or right upper abdomen, is constant, and increases in intensity over time. It is in some cases relieved by leaning forward and heightened by lying on the stomach. Back pain may be present and, if intense, may spread left and right. Back pain may be referred from the pancreas, or may indicate the cancer has penetrated paraspinal muscle, or entered the retroperitoneum and paraaortic lymph nodes Rectum :A local tumor in the rectum or recurrence involving the presacral plexus may cause pain normally associated with an urgent need to defecate. This pain may, rarely, return as phantom pain after surgical removal of the rectum, though pain within a few weeks of surgical removal of the rectum is usually neuropathic pain due to the surgery (described in one study as spontaneous, intermittent, mild to moderate shooting and bursting, or tight and aching), and pain emerging after three months (described as deep, sharp, aching, intense, and continuous, made worse by sitting or pressure) usually signals recurrence of the disease. The emergence of pain on standing or walking (described as \\"dragging\\") may indicate a deeper recurrence involving attachment to muscle or fascia. =Serous mucosa= Carcinosis of the peritoneum may cause pain through inflammation, disordered visceral motility, or pressure of the metastases on nerves. Once a tumor has penetrated or perforated hollow viscera, acute inflammation of the peritoneum appears, inducing severe abdominal pain. Pleural carcinomatosis is normally painless. =Soft tissue= Invasion of soft tissue by a tumor can cause pain by inflammatory or mechanical stimulation of nociceptors, or destruction of mobile structures such as ligaments, tendons and skeletal muscles. Diagnostic procedures Fig. 5: Cross section of the spinal cord showing the subarachnoid cavity, dura mater and spinal nerve roots including the dorsal root ganglion Some diagnostic procedures, such as venipuncture, paracentesis, and thoracentesis can be painful.International Association for the Study of Pain Treatment-Related Pain Lumbar puncture :In lumbar puncture a needle is inserted between two lumbar vertebrae, through the dura mater and arachnoid membrane surrounding the spinal cord, into the fluid-flled space between the arachnoid membrane and the spinal cord (the subarachnoid cavity), and cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) is withdrawn for examination. In one study, 14 percent of patients felt pain on lumbar puncture. (fig. 5) Post-dural-puncture headache :In some patients, subsequent leakage of CSF through the dura mater puncture causes reduced CSF levels in the brain and spinal cord, leading to the development of post-dural-puncture headache (PDPH) hours or days later. Onset occurs within two days in 66 percent and within three days in ninety percent of PDPH cases. It occurs so rarely immediately after puncture that other possible causes should be investigated when it does. :The headache is severe and described as \\"searing and spreading like hot metal,\\" involving the back and front of the head, and spreading to the neck and shoulders, sometimes involving neck stiffness. It is exacerbated by movement, and sitting or standing, and relieved to some degree by lying down. Nausea, vomiting, pain in arms and legs, hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, dizziness and paraesthesia of the scalp are common. Treatment-related Potentially painful cancer treatments include immunotherapy which may produce joint or muscle pain; radiotherapy, which can cause skin reactions, enteritis, fibrosis, myelopathy, bone necrosis, neuropathy or plexopathy; chemotherapy, often associated with mucositis, joint pain, muscle pain, peripheral neuropathy and abdominal pain due to diarrhea or constipation; hormone therapy, which sometimes causes pain flares; targeted therapies, such as trastuzumab and rituximab, which can cause muscle, joint or chest pain; angiogenesis inhibitors like bevacizumab, known to sometimes cause bone pain; and surgery, which may produce post-operative pain, post-amputation pain or pelvic floor myalgia. =Chemotherapy= Fig. 4: Chemotherapy drugs Chemotherapy may cause mucositis, muscle pain, joint pain, abdominal pain caused by diarrhea or constipation, and peripheral neuropathy Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy :Between 30 and 40 percent of patients undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin.http://www.kup.at/kup/pdf/10376.pdfhttp://www.ehealthme.com/ds/herceptin/peripheral%20sensory%20neuropathy Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, is determined by the choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory ‚Äì pain, tingling, numbness and temperature sensitivity ‚Äì in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system. :CIPN often follows the first chemotherapy dose and increases in severity as treatment continues, but this progression usually levels off at completion of treatment. The platinum-based drugs are the exception; with these drugs, sensation may continue to deteriorate for several months after the end of treatment. Some CIPN appears to be irreversible. Pain can often be helped with drug or other treatment but the numbness is usually resistant to treatment. A 2007 American study found that most patients did not recall being told to expect CIPN, and doctors monitoring the condition rarely asked how it affects daily living but focused on practical effects such as dexterity and gait. Mucositis :Cancer drugs can cause changes in the biochemistry of mucous membranes resulting in intense pain in the mouth, throat, nasal passages, and gastrointestinal tract. This pain can make talking, drinking, or eating difficult or impossible. Muscle and joint pain :Withdrawal of steroid medication can cause joint pain and diffuse muscle pain accompanied by fatigue; these symptoms resolve with recommencement of steroid therapy. Chronic steroid therapy can result in aseptic necrosis of the humoral or femoral head, resulting in shoulder or knee pain described as dull and aching, and reduced movement in or inability to use arm or hip. Aromatase inhibitors can cause diffuse muscle and joint pain and stiffness, and may increase the likelihood of osteoporosis and consequent fractures. =Radiotherapy= Radiotherapy may affect the connective tissue surrounding nerves, and may damage or kill white or gray matter in the brain or spinal cord. Fibrosis around the brachial or lumbosacral plexus :Radiotherapy may produce excessive growth of the fibrous tissue (fibrosis) around the brachial or lumbosacral plexui (clusters of nerves), which can result in damage to the nerves over time (6 months to 20 years). This nerve damage may cause numbness, \\"pins and needles\\" (dysesthesia) and weakness in the affected limb. If pain develops, it is described as diffuse, severe, burning pain, increasing over time, in part or all of the affected limb. Spinal cord damage :If radiotherapy includes the spinal cord, changes may occur which do not become apparent until some time after treatment. \\"Early delayed radiation-induced myelopathy\\" can manifest from six weeks to six months after treatment; the usual symptom is a Lhermitte sign (\\"a brief, unpleasant sensation of numbness, tingling and often electric- like discharge going from the neck to the spine and extremities, triggered by neck flexion\\"), usually followed by improvement two to nine months after onset, though in some cases symptoms persist for a long time. \\"Late delayed radiation-induced myelopathy\\" may occur six months to ten years after treatment. The typical presentation is Brown-S√©quard syndrome (movement problems and numbness to touch and vibration on one side of the body and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the other). Onset may be sudden but is usually progressive. Some patients improve and others deteriorate.

Description and history The John Hart House stands in The Hill, a cluster of closely spaced historic houses bounded on the north by Deer Street and the east by High Street at the northern edge of downtown Portsmouth. This grouping was created by a road widening project from houses originally located on or near Deer Street. This house is located in the center of the cluster, behind the Henry Sherburne House. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front facade is oriented to the south, toward an open plaza at the center of The Hill. The facade is five bays wide, with slightly asymmetrical placement around a centered entrance. The entrance is the most elaborate part of the facade, with attached columns and a segmented fanlight window, above which is a modillioned gable. The interior retains original finishes, including a central circular staircase. This house was probably built around 1808-10, the lot it originally stood on having been subdivided in 1808. The front entrance surround is one of the most unusual to survive from the Federal period in the city; it was probably based on examples published in architectural pattern books. This level of detail was also not typically found on middle-class housing of the period, of which this is an example. Originally oriented with a side gable end toward Deer Street, it was moved to its present location in the 1970s.

They attacked English settlements on the coast of present-day Maine between Berwick and St. Georges (Thomaston, Maine), within two months there were 9 raids - every town on the frontier had been attacked. Casco (also known as Falmouth and Portland) was the principal settlement. Background After the two attacks on Annapolis Royal in 1744, Governor William Shirley put a bounty on the Passamaquoddy, Mi‚Äôkmaq and Maliseet on Oct 20. The following year, during the Campaign, on August 23, 1745, Shirley declared war against the rest of the Wabanaki Confederacy ‚Äì the Penobscot and Kennebec tribes. In response to the New England expedition against Louisbourg which finished in June 1745, the Wabanaki retaliated by attacking the New England border. New England braced itself for such an attack by appointing a provisional force of 450 to defend the frontier. After the attacks began they increased the number of soldiers by 175 men. Massachusetts established forts along the border with Acadia: Fort George at Brunswick (1715),Fort George replaced Fort Andros which was built during King William's War (1688). St. George's Fort at Thomaston (1720), and Fort Richmond (1721) at Richmond. Fort Frederick was established at Pemaquid (Bristol, Maine). After the Northeast Coast Campaign (1745), another 200 British troops were sent to the New England/ Acadia border in January and 460 more in the spring. The campaign The 1746 campaign started on April 19 when a militia of 10 natives raided Gorhamtown. Gorham had a blockhouse and four families. The natives divided into five parties of two. They then attacked the four families at the same time. Killing a father and four children killed, while taking the mother captive. They took two other fathers prisoner. The men in the blockhouse charged after the natives and one of the militia men was taken captive. The Confederacy next raided present-day Waldoboro, Maine, burning the village and killing some while taking others into captivity. Some of the villagers fled to Pemaquid and others to St. Georges. People did not return until after the war. The Confederacy raided Pemaquid, killing cattle. A militia of 15 native men ambushed 5 people at Sheepscot (present-day Newcastle, Maine), killing one of them. A villager killed one of the natives. At Wiscasset, Maine, natives killed 19 cattle and took Captain Jonathan Williamson1752 - Georgetown region ‚Äì Charles Cushing is commandant ‚Äì Capt. Jonathan Williamson of Wiscasst and Capt Nichols from Sheepscot (Newcastle) served under him. (See Sewall, p. 282) captive for 6 months. There was a battle near Fort St. Georges at Thomaston where one native was killed and one wounded. A militia of 30 natives were at Falmouth and North Yarmouth, Maine. They killed two near Long-creek (Stroudwater). The soldiers from New Casco Fort approached, the natives retreated to attack Frost‚Äôs garrisoned house at Stroudwater but it was heavily defended. Another blockhouse was built. At Scarborough, Maine the natives killed a soldier and several others. Last attack happened on 26 August in the vicinity of Pemaquid, Fort Frederick. Settlers destroyed his cattle and entire habitation, wounding the owner and his son. Aftermath In response to these events, Shirley sent more troops and munitions to the Maine frontier over the winter, anticipating the Wabanaki Campaign in the spring of 1747. In response St. Georges was garrisoned with 30 men; 370 put between Berwick and Damariscotta. 150 were detailed as minute-men. Scalp bounties were increased to 250 pounds for scalps taken west of Passamquoddy, 100 for anywhere else.

The book appeared to mixed reviews and very poor sales, but it continued to be consulted well into the 20th century by scholars, and is considered \\"a remarkably accurate production for its day\\".  Contents  Volume 1 Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy Ywain and Gawain Launfal Volume 2 Lybeaus Disconus The Geste of Kyng Horn The King of Tars, and the Soudan of Damas Emare Sir Orpheo Chronicle of England Volume 3 Le Bone Florence of Rome The Erle of Toulous The Squyer of Lowe Degre The Knight of Curtesy, and the Fair Lady of Faguell Notes [including an edition of Horn Childe and Maiden Rimnild] Glossary  Composition  Up to this point only three complete Middle English romances had appeared in scholarly editions: Golagrus and Gawain and The Awntyrs of Arthure had been published by John Pinkerton, and Launfal by George Ellis. Thomas Percy's Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, arguably the ultimate source of inspiration for Ritson's collection, did not include any mediaeval romance in full, and only the synopsis of Lybeaus Disconus. Ritson approached the task with his usual insistence on the highest standards of editorial fidelity to the original text. \\"Every article\\", he wrote, \\"is derive'd from some ancient manuscript, or old printed copy, of the authenticity of which the reader has all possible satisfaction; and is printed with an accuracy, and adherence to the original, of which the publick has had very few examples\\". All manuscripts were transcribed by himself, with the exception of Sir Orpheo and The Erle of Toulous, copies of which were provided by Walter Scott and John Baynes respectively. Apart from being a literary scholar Ritson was also a spelling- reformer, and in all the editorial matter of the Romance√´s he adopted his own system of \\"etymological\\" spelling, a fact which was to deter readers and be seized on by hostile reviewers. Ritson's mental health was deteriorating as he worked on the book. He himself wrote of being \\"in continu'd state of il- health, and low spirits\\". This particularly manifested itself in the virulence of his many attacks on the poor scholarship of Percy, Pinkerton and Warton in a lengthy \\"Dissertation on Romance and Minstrelsy\\" with which he prefaced the work. In this Dissertation he addresses the problem of the origins of the romance form. He rejects not just Warton's theory that romance was a literary form that came to Europe from the Islamic world, but also the contentions of others that it came from the Celtic countries or from Scandinavia, concluding that its true point of origin was France. He proceeds first to a consideration of the state of the English language in the Middle Ages, which he thinks was at first too rude and undeveloped for French poets to have thought of borrowing romances from across the Channel, and then to a chronological survey of the English romances. Finally he considers the social history of the minstrel. This was a subject of long-standing dispute between himself and Thomas Percy, Percy holding that the minstrels enjoyed a high status in mediaeval society, while Ritson produced much evidence, here and elsewhere, to show that they were considered a low and vagabondish class. Such men, he thought, could not be the authors of the romances, which were rather the work of learned men. The Dissertation is piled high with relevant information, much of it new, but his theses are not always coherently developed, so that at times, as Monica Santini says, \\"the only thread of his argument is the continuous harrying of Warton\\".  Publication  The difficult problem of finding a publisher willing to take on such an unpromising work was solved by Ritson's friend George Ellis, who undertook to fund the project. A delay of several months was caused by the discovery of a number of derogatory comments about the Christian religion in Ritson's text, which the publishers, G. and W. Nicol, insisted should be removed, but the three volumes eventually appeared in October 1802. A second edition, revised by Edmund Goldsmid, was published by E. and G. Goldsmid in 1884-1885. In 1891 this edition was reissued in a cut-down form, the romances being limited to Ywain and Gawain, Launfal and Lybeaus Disconus.  Reception  Ritson's book bleakly anticipated its own financial and critical failure: > The editour abandons it to general censure, with cold indifference, > expecting little favour, and less profit; but certain, at any rate, to be > insulted by the malignant and calumnious personalitys of a base and > prostitute gang of lurking assassins, who stab in the dark, and whose > poison'd daggers he has experience'd. The work was indeed a commercial flop, the market for unmodernized Middle English verse not yet being in existence, especially when even the editorial matter had to be read in reformed spelling. It was already being reported in 1806 that it had fallen into \\"undeserved neglect\\", and it was left to Ellis's Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805) to capture the popular market. The Romance√´s were reviewed in the British Critic and the Critical Review, but not favourably or at length. Walter Scott, in the Edinburgh Review, was more friendly: > Let it be remembered to his honour, that, without the encouragement of > private patronage, or of public applause; without hopes of gain, and under > the certainty of severe critical censure, he has brought forward such a work > on national antiquities, as in other countries has been thought worthy of > the labour of universities, and the countenance of princes. He stressed the importance of the romances to the historian in telling us how our ancestors lived, acted and spoke. In private Scott was more critical, writing to Ellis that the Dissertation \\"reminds one of a heap of rubbish, which had either turned out unfit for the architect's purpose, or beyond his skill to make use of\\". In later years he preferred Henry Weber's \\"Metrical Romances\\" (1810). The poet Robert Southey was an out-and-out enthusiast for the Romance√´s. \\"Of all men living [Ritson is] the best qualified for the task, and the most trustworthy\\" he wrote in the Annual Review. In a letter to Coleridge he called it \\"a treasure of true old poetry‚Ä¶Ritson is the oddest, but most honest, of all our antiquaries, and he abuses Percy & Pinkerton with less mercy than justice.\\" He encouraged the writer William Taylor to find subjects for new poetry in Ritson's Romance√´s. Thomas De Quincey knew and admired the Romance√´s enough to induce Coleridge to include passages from them in his Royal Institution lectures on poetry, to their benefit. In fact he had enough readers among the writers of the Romantic movement to ensure a measurable influence on it. By the end of the 19th century the Middle English scholarship of Ritson's Romance√´s was no longer the state of the art. Walter Skeat pointed out a number of mistakes in the glossary, and remarked that the Romance√´s was \\"a valuable book in its way, but we must not trust it too much\\". Nevertheless, in 1938 Ritson's biographer Bertrand Bronson could point out that \\"Scholars still refer to these volumes with a frequency which is homage to the quality of Ritson's labor\\", and in 1989 the critic Rolf P. Lessenich wrote that it has \\"remained a useful edition across the centuries\\".

They believe her to be a reincarnation of Durga, the Hindu goddess, and she is one of several holders of the title of Kumari. Appointed in October 2010, she lived in Lalitpur, Nepal, and as per tradition, continued in her role until first menstruated in 2014. In early 2014, upon reaching puberty, she undertook a ritual involving untying her hair and removing her third eye, after which she was no longer considered a goddess.Nepal's Kumaris Transition From Living Goddesses to Typical Teens [PHOTOS] As a Kumari, she was considered omniscient and thus not educated. She was not allowed to walk anywhere - her feet could not touch the ground. After becoming 'mortal' i.e. after her tenure as a Kumari, she was able to integrate in society, beginning school, walking and learning an instrument. By 2014 she was attending St Xavier School in Patan as a conventional 13-year-old student, allowed to mix socially with classmates with almost no trace of her former role crossing over into her post-Kumari life.

Career  Maynez joined the Spanish Army in his youth, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1807, Maynez was appointed as Governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico. During his administration in New Mexico, he allowed the Neomexicanos to trade with pagans and the province of Nueva Vizcaya. This meant the merchants needed only government approval and passports to trade with them (the passports were required to confirm that the number of armed men in the transactions was enough). In 1808, he was replaced by Jos√© Manrique. Several years later, in 1815 he was appointed acting Governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico and city councilman in Santa Fe. In addition, he served as protector of the Native Americans who lived in the province (at this time New Mexico, according to the Cadiz Constitution was a province of Spain). During his administration, the settlers in the Pecos River continued hunting and trading with the Comanche people, establishing good relations with them.

In 1816, the governor of Taos Pueblo sued the many settlers who had just settled in San Fernando de Taos and Arroyo Hondo, near San Fernando. However the mayor of Taos, Pedro Martinez, and the Friar of the Taos Mission, Jose Benito Pereyro, argued that lands that were not cultivated by Native Americans (including Arroyo Hondo's lands) should belong to the Criollos, because they were descendants of Spaniards. In addition, Maynez ordered the settlers of San Fernando de Taos to abandon the lands which were propriety of the Pueblo Native Americans. In October 1815, Maynez issued a law that defended the Indigenous rights of New Mexico. In 1816, during the final year of his government in New Mexico, 280 Spanish colonists protested the new 5% tax (which had been set by the Alcalde Mayor of Taos, Pedro Martin).

In 1965, he went freelance, and in 1966 he joined the Light Programme where he was heard presenting the daily afternoon show Midday Spin; at the same time he also hosted a record review show on Radio Luxembourg. Following a similar path to DJs Tony Blackburn, Kenny Everett and Simon Dee, he made the natural progression to BBC Radio 1 at its launch in September 1967. Brady was given a major six-day-a-week afternoon slot Monday to Saturdays. He played a varied mix of current pop and rock music, new releases as well as big band, jazz and instrumental music. The second half of the show was also carried on BBC Radio 2. In July 1968, he became one of the original presenters of Thames Television's new children's magazine programme, Magpie. He continued with Magpie until 1971, when he returned to radio for a short time before setting up his own production company.

He wrote this dissertation in accordance with the demand of Ma'mun, the caliph of the time. It is revered as the most precious Islamic literature in the science of medicine, and was entitled \\"the golden treatise\\" as Ma'mun had ordered it written in gold ink. The chain of narrators is said to reach Muhammad ibn Jumhoor or al-Hassan ibn Muhammad al-Nawfali who is described as \\"highly esteemed and trustworthy\\" by al-Najjashi. The treatise of Ali al-Ridha includes scientific branches such as Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry and Pathology when medical science was still primitive. According to the treatise, one's health is determined by four humors of blood, yellow bile, black bile and phlegm, the suitable proportion of which maintains the health. The liver plays an important role in producing and maintaining the required proportions in the body. Ali al-Ridha describes the body as a kingdom whose king is the heart while the (blood) vessels, the limbs, and the brain are the laborers. Author The name of Ali al-Ridha in Arabic The treatise is authored by Ali al-Ridha who was the seventh descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the eighth of the Twelve Imams. His given name was 'Alƒ´ ibn M≈´sƒÅ ibn Ja'far. He was born in the house of Imam Musa al-Kadhim (the seventh Imam of Twelver Shia Islam) in Medina on the eleventh of Dhu al-Qi'dah, 148 AH (December 29, 765 CE). Ali al-Ridha was summoned to Khurasan and reluctantly accepted the role of successor to Ma'mun that was forced on him. He did not outlive Ma'mun, having been given poisoned grapes by him while accompanying him in Persia, and died at Tus on May 26, 818. Ali al-Ridha is buried within Imam Ridha Mosque, in Mashhad, Iran. Background The Ma'mun's palace was a center for philosophical and scientific researches in which many scientific seminars were held. One of the mentioned seminars was on man's body which included the greatest scholars and leaders. Ali al-Ridha, Ma'mun, Gabriel b. Bakhtishu (the physician), Masawaiyh (the physician) and Salih ibn Salhama (the Indian philosopher) were some participants of that medical seminar. The participants were involved in a lengthy discussion about the body makeup and various types of foods, while Ali al-Ridha kept silent. Afterwards, Ma'mun asked him to demonstrate his knowledge of physiology and nutrition and Imam replied: Soon after that, Ma'mun departed for Balkh, and wrote to Imam asking him to fulfill his promise and write a treatise on the body and its health, hence Imam authored \\"The Golden Treatise\\" at the request of Ma'mun. Contents A manuscript of \\"Al-Risalah al-Dhahabiah\\". The text says:\\"Golden dissertation in medicine which is sent by Imam Ali ibn Musa al-Ridha, peace be upon him, to al-Ma'mun. The dissertation of Ali al-Ridha includes scientific branches such as Anatomy, Physiology, Chemistry and Pathology when medical science was still primitive. it begins as follows: Ali al-Ridha writes in his treatise that one's health is in accordance with the balance of phlegm, yellow bile, blood and black bile; an individual becomes sick when this proportion is unbalanced. Nutrition and traditional medicine may be used to cure imbalances. The liver plays an important role in producing and maintaining the required proportions in the body. Ali al-Ridha describes the body as a kingdom whose king is the heart while the (blood) vessels, the limbs, and the brain are workers. He then continues as such: Imam al-Rida names the main organs of the human body as the heart, the nerves, the brain, the hands and the Legs the ear and the eye. He discusses their characteristics and functions in detail. Regarding the human body containing systems and cells he said: In another part of the treatise, he discusses what kind of foods are suitable according to season, time of the day and the age of an individual. He says: In other parts, he discusses body disease, months and seasons of the year. Reception Ali ibn Musa al-Rida sent his dissertation to Ma'mun who was very pleased to receive it and showed his great interest by ordering that the treatise be written down in gold ink, hence it came to be known as the \\"Gold Treatise\\". Ma'mun praised it and said: Commentaries on the treatise Various commentaries have been written on this dissertation some of which are as follows: # Tarjamat al-Alawi lil Tibb al-Radawi by Sayyid Diaud-Din Abul-Rida Fadlallah ibn Ali al-Rawandi (548 AH) # Tarjamat al-Dhahabiyya by mawla Faydallah 'Usarah al-Shushtari # Tarjamat al-Dhahabiyya by Muhammad Baqir Majlisi.

It was created in the 18th century, influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and has not been changed much, preserving a park of the period. It forms part of the World Heritage Site \\"Classical Weimar\\".  Location  The park is located on both banks of the river Ilm for from the Schloss in the north to the suburb of Oberweimar in the south. The park is part of a much longer greenway along the river, including the park of Schloss Belvedere in the north and the park of Schloss Tiefurt. The Park an der Ilm is divided into the Goethe-Park and the Dux-Garten.  History  Goethe's garden house on the eastern slope of the park Landscaping for the park began in 1778, influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, in the style of an English landscape garden, in modification of a Baroque garden. Goethe had purchased a garden house in the park in 1776, which now carries his name. The W√∂rlitz park, which Goethe had visited regularly from 1776 and which served as the setting of his 1809 novel Die Wahlverwandtschaften, was a model. After planting special trees from 1778, systematic work began in 1785. Goethe's house and the opposite Roman House (de) are among many architectural features of the park, including bridges and monuments. The design was finished in 1823 with the Tempelherrenhaus. A suspension bridge was built in 1833. From 1848 to 1852, court gardener Eduard Petzold created views to Goethe's garden house and the Roman house. A monument to Shakespeare was erected in 1904 by Otto Lessing on a commission of the Deutsche Shakespeare-Gesellschaft, founded in Weimar in 1864. Poets Louis F√ºrnberg, Adam Mickiewicz, S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi and Alexander Puschkin were also honoured by busts in the park. The park contains valuable trees, mostly local varieties, but also some foreign trees, especially from North America. In 1993, 770 maples, 455 ash trees, 381 linden, 291 chestnuts and 257 hornbeams were counted, with an average age of 80 to 150 years at the time. From 1969, the park was taken care of by Gartendirektion der Nationalen Forschungs- und Gedenkst√§tten der klassischen deutschen Literatur.

Poole was a Cavendish College, Cambridge graduate who immigrated to Uruguay in 1885 to work as an English teacher at the English High School of Montevideo, where he was active until 1920.  Uruguayan football  By the time of his arrival, there were already some clubs practicing football informally in Uruguay such as the Montevideo Cricket Club, founded in 1861 (the first rugby club outside the United Kingdom), and the Montevideo Rowing Club, founded in 1874. In his spare time, Poole devoted his energy to disseminating and organising the sport in Uruguay. Henry Candid Lichtenberger, an 18-year-old man who was Poole's disciple, founded the first Uruguayan football team on 2 June 1886, the Club Albion. In its original statute, the Albion did not accept foreign players. The Football Association was characterised by having, as the major part of its associates, Uruguayan-born children of The English. Poole's legacy was to organise and professionalise the sport in Uruguay. Unlike Lichtenberger, Poole required the participation of both nationals and foreigners with no distinction of race, language, religion, political opinion or economic position. This mindset was incorporated into Uruguay's mentality. Poole also acted not only as a player ‚Äì being a frontline for the Uruguay National Team ‚Äì but also as a referee and as the President of the Uruguayan Association Football League, founded on 30 March 1900, a precursor of today‚Äôs Uruguayan Football Association (Asociaci√≥n Uruguaya de F√∫tbol ‚Äì AUF). Poole also practiced rowing, cricket and rugby union, but his real passion was association football. In his free time, he used to take his students to practice in the Montevideo neighborhood of Punta Carretas, close to the current location of a shopping center. The Montevideo city hall paid honour to Poole by dedicating a place called \\"Espacio Libre William Leslie Poole\\" between Constituyente and V√°squez avenues in the Uruguayan capital.

Described as \\"a shrewd and unscrupulous business man\\", he survived several scandals and became a major landowner when he returned to Scotland in 1765. Johnstone sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain from 1774 to 1780, having bribed his way to a victory in the Dysart Burghs.  Early life and family  Johnstone was born in Edinburgh, the fifth son of Sir James Johnstone, 3rd Baronet (1697‚Äì1772) and his wife, Barbara (died 1773), daughter of Alexander Murray, 4th Lord Elibank. The Jacobite plotter Alexander Murray of Elibank was his uncle. His brothers included the British Army officer and politician Sir James Johnstone, 4th Baronet (1726‚Äì1794), the wealthy lawyer and politician William (later Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet (1729‚Äì1805), and the politician and Royal Navy officer George Johnstone (1730‚Äì1787). Another brother, Patrick, died in the Black Hole of Calcutta. In 1765 Johnstone married Elizabeth Caroline Keene, daughter of a Colonel Keene from Northamptonshire, and niece of the diplomat Sir Benjamin Keene. They had one son and daughter. His son, James Raymond Johnstone of Alva, married Mary Elizabeth Cholmeley (b. c 1778, d. 9 Sep 1843). The family became very powerful, and it was claimed that by the late 1750s they were \\"involved in every major event in the British Empire\\".  Career  = India = Johnstone went to Bengal in 1751, as a writer for the East India Company. He was at Dacca in 1756 when conflict broke out and was taken prisoner. After his release, emboldened by the death of his brother Patrick, he volunteered to join the company's military forces under Robert Clive for the Battle of Plassey, and saw further military service before resuming civilian work in 1757. In about 1760 Johnstone was placed in charge of the company's affairs in Midnapore, and became a member of the Bengal Council. His success there led to a transfer in 1762 to Burdwan, where he developed private businesses which led to conflict with Henry Vansittart, the Governor of Bengal. This led to Johnstone being dismissed by the Company in early 1764, but the company's Court of Directors overturned the decision on 21 March 1764, and he was reinstated by May. Johnstone's former ally Robert Clive did not support Johnstone's return to his post, and when Clive succeeded Vansittart as governor in 1765 he began an inquiry into gifts totalling over ¬£50,000 which Johnstone had secured from the new Nawab of Bengal, Najimuddin Ali Khan. In 1764, the Company had adopted new regulations which required its officers to sign a covenant that they would accept non-trivial gifts only with the prior approval of the directors. Clive forced the resignation of Johnstone, who sailed for Britain in October 1765 with a fortune estimated at ¬£300,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Aged 31, Johnstone proceeded to buy estates in Scotland, first at Alva in Stirlingshire, and later in Selkirkshire and Dumfriesshire. = Scotland = John Johnstone, his niece Betty Johnstone and her aunt Miss Wedderburn, attributed to Henry Raeburn John Johnstone, Betty Johnstone and Miss Wedderburn, attrib Henry Raeburn, BBC, retrieved July 2014 The Johnstone family account says that he spent \\"about a ninth\\" of his money on the estates at Alva, Hanginghaw and Denovan, and \\"lived quietly\\" there until his election to Parliament. However his letters to his brother William reveal that he continued to engage in speculation and stock manipulation. Meanwhile, the directors of the East India Company moved to prosecute Johnstone for his actions. His allies, led by George Dempster, lobbied on his behalf and in his defence Johnstone published in 1766 \\"A letter to the proprietors of East-India stock\\", subtitled \\"Vindication of His Conduct in Receiving Presents from the Native Governments of India\\". In May 1767, the General Court of the East India Company over-ruled its directors, and dropped all prosecutions against its former servants, and Johnstone walked free. The following year, at the 1768 general election, Johnstone contested the parliamentary borough of Haslemere in Surrey, where he was defeated. At the next election, in 1774 Johnstone used guile and money to win the seat of Dysart Burghs, which consisted of five burghs in the county of Fife: Kirkcaldy, Burntisland, Kinghorn, and Dysart. The Caledonian Mercury reported on 2 November 1774 that Johnstone did not declare his interest until after the burghs had chosen their delegates, and caught the sitting MP James Oswald by surprise. Johnstone won the support of Dysart, and bribed the backing of Burntisland and Kinghorn delegates, winning the seat. However, at the 1780 election Johnstone lost the support of Burntisland to his opponent John Henderson, who won the seat on the casting vote of Kirkcaldy.  Death and legacy  Alva House in the early 20th century Johnstone died on 10 December 1795, aged 61, at home in Alva House, which had been remodelled and expanded in 1789 to the designs of Robert Adam. The works included a mausoleum to house the remains of Johnstone and his wife Caroline. His son James Raymond Johnstone (died 1830), had 8 children, of whom the eldest James Johnstone (1801‚Äì1888) was MP for Clackmannanshire and Kinross-shire. Alva house remained in his family for over a century, and in 1890 it passed to his descendant Carolin Johnstone. She sold the surrounding estate to reduce her debts, but failed to clear them, and the house was abandoned by the 1920s. It was used for target practice during World War II, and left in ruins.

Representing 83 member organisations from 33 European countries, across all business sectors (data from 2014). Cooperatives Europe promotes the cooperative business model in Europe and advocates for a level playing field between cooperatives and other forms of enterprise. Its members represent 123 million individual member cooperators owning 160.000 cooperative enterprises and providing jobs to 5.4 million European citizens. As part of the International Cooperative Alliance, Cooperatives Europe maintains the internationally recognised definition of a cooperative in the Statement on the Cooperative Identity which also defines seven cooperative principles. Over time, the international cooperative movement has made small readjustments to this first set of principles of the Rochdale cooperative. The most recent adjustment was made in 1995 at the Centennial Congress of the International Cooperative Alliance, when the seven cooperative principles were approved: voluntary and open membership, democratic member control, member economic participation, autonomy and independence, education, training and information, cooperation among cooperatives, and concern for the community. The new principles, while building on and refining the previously accepted ones, firmly positioned cooperatives as jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprises based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality and solidarity. On the first Saturday of July each year, Cooperatives Europe celebrates International Cooperative Day. In December 2009, the United Nations declared 2012 as the International Year of Cooperatives.  History  Cooperatives Europe was established on 7 March 2006 as a not-for-profit association under Belgian law (ASBL),. The first General Assembly took place in Manchester, on 11 November 2006, where Dame Pauline Green and Etienne Pflimlin were elected co-presidents. Since April 2017, Jean-Louis Bancel is the President of Cooperatives Europe. Since 2012, Cooperatives Europe is recognised as Civil Society Organisation, and takes therefore part in the Policy Forum on Development, organised by the European Commission‚Äôs DG DevCo. Cooperatives Europe has organised several seminars on international cooperation such as the event Cooperatives and Sustainable Development: Challenges for the Post-2015 Agenda, co-organised with CoopBuro in Brussels, among others. Cooperatives Europe is one of the partners within the European Year for Development (EYD2015), EU‚Äôs first ever thematic year dedicated to international development cooperation. 2015 is a special year for development. It is the first ever European Year to deal with the European Union's external action and Europe‚Äôs role in the world. For development organisations all over Europe it is an unparalleled opportunity to showcase Europe's commitment to eradicating poverty worldwide and to inspire more Europeans to get engaged and involved in development. 2015 is also the year in which the Millennium Development Goals that the world agreed to reach in 2000, and in which the international community will agree on the future global framework for poverty eradication and sustainable development. See Cooperatives Europe's profile and actions on EYD2015's website. Responding to the need of more and more young cooperators in Europe to develop contacts with peers in other countries, Cooperatives Europe has created and is developing a European network of Young Cooperators.  Structure  Cooperatives Europe is run by a secretariat based in Brussels. Strategic guidelines are decided by the General Assembly of Cooperatives Europe, which meets at least once a year. The General Assembly elects the board of directors, which is in charge of the development and implementation of the strategic multi-annual programme, and one president, who also acts as vice-president of the International Cooperative Alliance for the European Region.

It had a lively and colorful layout, and made full use of the newly invented photogravure technology. Its focus was on social satire rather than political commentary. La Caricature covered the theater, news events, gossip and topical subjects such as the vote for women or seaside vacations. The founding editor, Albert Robida, left in 1892. The journal began to decline in quality, went through various changes of ownership and management, and eventually was merged with a rival tabloid. Foundation La Caricature was published weekly between 1880 and 1904, first by Librairie illustr√©e, then by Eugene Kolb and finally by Fayard fr√®res. The founding editor was Albert Robida (1848‚Äì1926). The new journal had a lively and colorful format, exploiting the recently invented photogravure technique. The title recalled the earlier La Caricature (1830‚Äì1843) founded by Charles Philipon, which portrayed Louis Philippe as a pear, and which included works by the great Honor√© Daumier. The new Caricature was less politically engaged than its predecessor, focusing more on caricature of the manners of the age. Robida period The first issue appeared on 3 January 1880, heralding a break from the oppressive morality of the regime that had followed the fall of the Paris Commune in 1871. However, La Caricature appeared before the act of 29 July 1881 gave much greater freedom to the press. The masthead of La Caricature was classic in design, at first showing Albert Robida as editor, and La Librairie illustr√©e as publisher. The offices were 7 rue du Croissant, the same premises as La Librairie illustr√©e, in the heart of the press district of Paris. The journal appeared every Friday. With eight pages of drawings, and little text, La Caricature gave stories in pictures without captions, silhouettes, portraits and large compositions, including all forms of caricature at the time. It covered news, literature, theater and gossip, but generally avoided political comment. It often made fun of Sarah Bernhardt, Alexandre Dumas and √âmile Zola. In May 1880 La Caricature published a cartoon of Sarah Bernhardt's planned trip to the USA, making fun of her thin figure, her grandiose opinion of her importance, and the public view of her epic battles with adversity. The paper caricatured the Salon exhibitions, fashion and horse racing. It was common for an issue to be devoted to one topic such as women's emancipation, sea bathing or a visit to a ch√¢teau. The 25 October 1883 issue was devoted to La Guerre au vingti√®me si√®cle (War in the 20th Century). It shows a war fought in 1975 between Australia and Mozambique using every possible weapon. Robida borrowed ideas from Jules Verne. Unlike Verne he was unconcerned with whether his machines could really work, purely interested in the image. In other futuristic illustrated stories Robida depicted many grotesque types of mechanical transport, including submarine pleasure boats, as well as television news, video phones, excursions to the moon and synthetic food. Other whimsical concepts of his prosperous world of the future included air taxis, transatlantic balloons, aerial hotels, underwater sports and a women-only stock exchange. The Improvement of Paris by the Metro by Robida from issue 338, 19 June 1886 Robida was ambivalent about modernization. His drawing of The Embellishment of Paris by the Metro appeared on the 19 June 1886 cover. Robida depicts Paris as a woman, her crown adorned with the windmills that had once stood on the hills of the city, violated by a network of railways that run over or through famous structures of the city. Robida used color boldly, in contrast to other journals of the time. La Caricature gave good coverage to theater in the early years, typically focusing on one production. This was not advertising. The journal did not produce posters for the shows, but gave pictures that captured the mood of the shows in exaggerated form, with critical comment written in a satirical vein. The large theatrical pictures drawn by Robida mainly appeared in the first three years. They were revived in 1897 when the journal was under new management, now drawn by Maurice Radiguet. The work of young artists such as Ferdinand Bac, Caran d'Ache and Louis Morin was published in La Caricature. The cartoonist Draner (Jules Jean Georges Renard; 1833‚Äì1926) contributed illustrations, including most of the military items and also caricatures of sportsmen, domestic servants in large houses and people wearing the ridiculous fashions of past periods, such as the days of Louis Philippe. The cartoonist Job (Jacques Onfroy de Br√©ville; 1858‚Äì1931) also contributed cartoons, depicting horses and small scenes of gallantry. \\"Nouvelle carte d'Europe,\\" by A. Robida. Published as a supplement of La Caricature. Map flanked by vignettes of major cities. Includes notes. Map of Europe with cartoon-like allegorical and human figures representing individual countries. Later years On 2 July 1892, with issue 653, Robida retired after twelve years as editor and Eugene Kolb became the head of La Caricature. With Robida's departure the journal lost some of its graphic appeal, and became more clich√©d. On 5 September 1896 Kolb's name was dropped from the masthead of issue 871, which now simply said \\"weekly journal\\". In January 1897 the journal was sold to the Librairie Fayard, and Fayard fr√®res began to appear on the masthead. On 23 January 1893 the office moved to 78 boulevard St Michel, in the premises of the Librairie Dentu. B. Roussat became the manager. Soon after La Caricature abandoned photogravure for halftone etching. There were repeated changes of manager. The paper began to adopt a more strident and populist tone. On 31 December 1904 the last issue of La Caricature announced its merger with L‚ÄôIndiscret, a black and white tabloid that gave more images than La Caracature but lower quality.

In the , Winchelsea South had a population of 179 people. Winchelsea South has always been a sparsely-populated rural area, with the locality most known for a brown coal mine which operated within its boundaries from 1921 until 1928, and again from 1931 to 1932, and from 1943 to 1957. The mine, alternately known as the Winchelsea South, Bambra or Wensleydale coal mine, was owned respectively by Western District Coal Mines Pty. Ltd, Otway Coal Co. Ltd, Wensley Bray Coal Mine Pty. Ltd. and finally Roche Bros. Pty. Ltd. It sold coal to industrial establishments in Geelong, and supplied the cement works at Fyansford. In 1923-24, an aerial ropeway was built from the mine to a coal loading bin on the Wensleydale railway line, and it operated until the mine's closure in 1932. The ropeway was damaged in the 1939 Black Friday fires and did not reopen with the mine in 1943. The mine's final owners installed coal loading facilities at Winchelsea railway station instead, and sold the coal further afield within Victoria. The mine closed in 1957, having produced about three million tons of coal. The opening of a newer mine at Anglesea, which was said to be more easily worked, was given as a major reason for its closure. The Wensleydale mine was flooded thereafter, becoming a lake, which has been used for water sports, and forms one of the main features of the locality today.

He is known for his research in which he uses video to analyse social interaction in everyday settings in particular the workplace. Career In 1977 Heath was appointed Research Fellow in the Department of General Practice, University of Manchester working with the late Professor P.S Byrne. In 1986 Heath published Body Movement and Speech in Medical Interaction which drew on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to analyse multimodal communication in the general practice consultations, including the physical examination, the opening and closing of the consultation and the use of medical records and early computers. In 1988 while continuing research on medical interaction, including studies of diagnosis, the expression of pain, and the management of embarrassment, he was granted leave from the University of Surrey firstly to undertake an Alexandra von Humboldt Stiftung Fellowship at the University of Constance with Thomas Luckmann and then to become a Visiting Senior Fellow at the EuroPARC, (the European base of Xerox PARC at that time) in Cambridge. With Paul Luff he explored the interactional foundations of technology use in a variety of settings, including architectural practices, medical consultations and the control rooms of London Underground. These projects and the collaboration with Paul Luff led to the organization of the Work, Interaction and Technology (WIT) Research Group, now Research Centre. Since 1998 WIT has been based at King's College London. In 2000 Heath published Technology in Action which addressed diverse issues including collaborative production of news stories, teamwork in traffic control, and the interactional incongruities that arise in media spaces and virtual environments. These studies became part of the emerging fields of Workplace Studies and CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) and contributed to knowledge of embodied action and multimodal interaction in ethnomethodology and conversation analysis. Heath's research was undertaken in close collaboration with industry and the public services; the results were used in the design and development of paper-digital technologies, media spaces and virtual environments, and also in the creation of systems to enable event recognition for European transport operators including London Underground and the RATP Paris. In the late 1990s, Heath continued to study work and organisation, medical and healthcare settings and auctions of art and antiques. He collaborated with Dirk vom Lehn, Jason Cleverly and colleagues at WIT, to examine communication in museums, galleries and science centres, focussing on how people engage and respond to exhibits and exhibitions through social interaction. The programme of research involved close collaboration with museums and galleries in the UK and abroad including the Science Museum London, Tate Britain, the V&A; and the Exploratorium San Francisco. In 2010, with Jon Hindmarsh and Paul Luff, he published Video in Qualitative Research, an introduction to using video analysis in the study of social interaction in everyday life.\\"Book Review. 50.

She first became interested in country music as a kid growing up on Long Island, and first began making music as the lead singer of Amy Allison and the Maudlins. She then joined Ryan Hedgecock to form the country duo Parlor James in 1994, before embarking on a solo career in 1996. Early life Allison grew up on Long Island, where she was raised by her parents, Mose and Audre Allison. She is the second of their four children.Mose Allison Biography She has recalled to American Songwriter that, as a child, she was one of a very small number of people in Long Island who listened to country music. She has also cited Billie Holiday and Loretta Lynn as some of her musical influences. Musical career Allison began her musical career as the frontwoman of \\"Amy Allison and the Maudlins\\", a band that performed at Dixon Place in New York City's East Village. She also teamed up with Ryan Hedgecock (the founder of country group Lone Justice) to form the musical duo Parlor James in 1994. In 2010, she performed the Buddy Johnson song \\"This New Situation\\" as a duet with her father, which appeared on his album \\"The Way of the World\\". She has also performed on albums by the Silos, They Might Be Giants, and Mudhoney's album Under a Billion Suns. In 2000, fellow Diesel Only Records artist Laura Cantrell included her cover of Allison's song, \\"The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter,\\" which originally appeared on the Maudlin Years, on her album Not the Tremblin' Kind. Allison later became well known in the United Kingdom from her performances opening for Cantrell on tour in 2002. Since then, she has written the opening track on Cantrell's album No Way There From Here, as well as the title track on her album \\"Kitty Wells Dresses: Songs of the Queen of Country Music.\\" =Solo career= Allison released her solo debut album, The Maudlin Years, in 1996 on Koch Records. It compiled songs she recorded with the Maudlins, as well as some of her solo songs she had originally recorded as demos. Elvis Costello later ranked it as one of his \\"500 essential albums\\" in Vanity Fair. She followed it up with 2001's Sad Girl, which was described by Peter Margasak as \\"an elegant, detailed mix of pedal-steel-soaked country and blue-eyed soul\\". Since then, she has released three additional albums: No Frills Friend (2003), Everything and Nothing Too (2006), and Sheffield Streets (2009). Reception Allison's voice has often been described by critics as nasal and high-pitched, and as an \\"acquired taste\\" that seems off-putting at first but becomes more attractive after repeated listens, or which may drive some listeners away entirely on its own. Her voice has also led critics to compare her to a wide variety of well-known country artists, including Neil Young, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Iris Dement, and \\"a less urbane Victoria Williams.\\" She has also been described as a \\"demented Dolly Parton.\\" Jad Fair has described her as one of his favorite songwriters. Many critics have also noted that Allison's music often focuses on very depressing topics. In response to critics making this observation, Allison said, \\"Maybe I do tend to concentrate on the more miserable aspects of life in my work, but it's a thrill when you have a good idea for a song, and you're doing it, and communicating. I have really good experiences performing live, with people really responding.\\" Critics' comparisons of Allison's music to that of her father have varied. Mark Keresman noted that while Allison's music is a different genre than her father's, they nevertheless share \\"a similar succinctness, wry humor, and keen eye for the perils of the human condition.\\" Billboard also highlighted the shared succinctness of her and her father's music in its review of the Maudlin Years.

Exploits exist empirically, but were not studied from a theoretical perspective prior to the emergence of the framework of weird machines. In computer security, the weird machine is a computational artifact where additional code execution can happen outside the original specification of the program. It is closely related to the concept of weird instructions, which are the building blocks of an exploit based on crafted input data.  Theory  From a theoretical perspective, the emergence of weird machines becomes clear when one considers software as a way to restrict the number of reachable states and state transitions of a computer: The general-purpose CPU is, through software, specialized to simulate a finite-state machine (with potentially very large state space). Many states the CPU could be in are excluded, and certain state transitions are ruled out - for example those that violate the security desiderata of the software. When the system is somehow moved into a state that \\"makes no sense\\" when viewed from the perspective of the intended finite-state machine (through memory corruption, hardware failure, or other programming mistakes), the software will keep transforming the broken state into new broken states, triggered by further user input. A new computational device arises: The weird machine which can reach different states of the CPU than the programmer anticipated, and which does so in reaction to inputs.  Applications  The functionality of the weird machine is invoked through unexpected inputs. While expected, valid input activates the normal, intended functionality in a computer program, input that was unexpected by the program developer may activate unintended functionality. The weird machine consists of this unintended functionality that can be programmed with selected inputs in an exploit. In a classical attack taking advantage of a stack buffer overflow, the input given to a vulnerable program is crafted and delivered so that it itself becomes executed as program code. However, if the data areas of the program memory have been protected so that they cannot be executed directly like this, the input may instead take the form of pointers into pieces of existing program code that then become executed in an unexpected order to generate the functionality of the exploit. These snippets of code that are used by the exploit are referred to as gadgets in the context of return- oriented programming. Through interpretation of data as code, weird machine functionality that is by definition outside the original program specification can be reached also by proof-carrying code (PCC), which has been formally proven to function in a certain specific way. This disparity is essentially caused by a disconnect between formal abstract modelling of a computer program and its real-world instance, which can be influenced by events that are not captured in the original abstraction, such as memory errors or power outages. Weird machine behaviors are observed even in hardware. For instance, it has been shown that one can do computation with only MOV instructions in x86.  Mitigation  Two central categories of mitigation to the problems caused by weird machine functionality include input validation within the software and protecting against problems arising from the platform on which the program runs, such as memory errors. Input validation aims to limit the scope and forms of unexpected inputs e.g. through whitelists of allowed inputs, so that the software program itself would not end up in an unexpected state by interpreting the data internally. Equally importantly, secure programming practices such as protecting against buffer overflows make it less likely that input data becomes interpreted in unintended ways by lower layers, such as the hardware on which the program is executed.

Nonetheless the studios continued to be used, sometimes facilitating location shooting nearby. During the later stages of the Second World War the studios were requisitioned for other use first by the Germans and later by the Allies.

Ninety-percent funded by FIFA, it stars Tim Roth, G√©rard Depardieu and Sam Neill, and is directed by Fr√©d√©ric Auburtin. It premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on 18 May 2014. The film's release in North America on 5 June 2015 was particularly unsuccessful, coinciding with the 2015 FIFA corruption case. In the United States, the film grossed $918 in its opening weekend, and was poorly reviewed and described as propaganda, and is considered to be one of the worst films of all time. The film was also a major box-office bomb, losing $26.8 million worldwide and failing to obtain a theatrical distribution in many markets. Plot In 1905, after the English football federation rejects an offer to join the formation of an international governing body for football, Robert Gu√©rin forms FIFA, and makes himself the first president. Years after its formation, it is all but unknown. Jules Rimet, then president of FIFA, publicly mocks Uruguay's victory in the 1924 Summer Olympic football games, hoping that this audacious move will make FIFA more publicly visible. However, the media does not publish his mockery. Still optimistic, he decides that the only way to make themselves known is to organize a truly international tournament: the World Cup. Rimet is at the point of giving up organizing the World Cup due to a lack of funds until he receives an unexpected letter from Enrique Buero. Buero and his South American ties will fund the first World Cup, hoping that in doing so, it will make Uruguay and other South American countries more well-known. Rimet and Buero collude to award the first World Cup to Uruguay. In 1930, Uruguay wins the first World Cup. Rimet remains president of FIFA, working through the Great Depression, looming war, and disagreement among FIFA members; Rimet would organize the 1938 World Cup, but would fail to do so in 1942 and 1946 due to World War II. After the war, Rimet organized two more World Cups in 1950 and 1954. The World Cup and FIFA after the war grew significantly, with many new members joining in many parts of the world. After many years, FIFA is now under the reign of president Jo√£o Havelange. Havelange is voted into power using expensive trips and various modern lobbying tactics. Havelange sees FIFA as an organization in financial disarray, and works to find various sponsors to finance its operation. Throughout his tenure as the president of FIFA, he has a right hand man, Sepp Blatter, who impresses Havelange with his unrelenting work. Eventually, Blatter becomes the next president of FIFA. Corruption within FIFA builds up over the years from Havelange's expansion efforts. As president of FIFA, Blatter is tasked to clean this up, for which he is seen as a controversial president. Many FIFA officials attempt to vote him out of office because of how incorruptible he is. The movie ends with a 2006 vote, in which Blatter is able to retain his presidency by cowing the corrupt members of FIFA, threatening to expose their ill deeds if they do not endorse Blatter and his anti-corruption campaign by voting for him as the FIFA president.

FIFA wanted the film finished for release in the summer of 2014, ahead of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The film's script was completed in four months. FIFA's original title suggestions for the film were Men of Legend and The Dreammakers. Release The film's United States release coincided with the 2015 FIFA corruption case, in which several current and former members of FIFA's executive committee were arrested for charges of corruption. The corruption investigation led to the resignation of FIFA's president, Sepp Blatter, following decades of speculation and accusations of corruption at FIFA under his leadership. The film was accused of ignoring these long-running claims. Roth has said that he asked the filmmakers: \\"Where's all the corruption in the script? Where is all the back-stabbing, the deals?\\" He said he attempted to convey these elements through his performance, saying: \\"It was a tough one. I tried to slide in a sense of it, as much as I could get in there.\\" The film's director, Fr√©d√©ric Auburtin, claimed he inserted \\"ironic parts\\" into the film. Prior to its release, comedian John Oliver lampooned the film in a segment on his show Last Week Tonight, saying that the \\"movie, like FIFA itself, looks terrible\\" and asking, \\"Who makes a sports film where the heroes are the executives?\\" The film also faced criticism from media concerning the ¬£16 million cost of production, more than the annual turnover of most of FIFA's national associations. Reception =Box office= The film was made on a budget of between $25‚Äì32 million, with the Los Angeles Times reporting an estimated budget of $29 million. Roughly ¬£17 million (about US$27 million; 90% of the total budget) was financed by FIFA. The film was reported to have lost around $26.8 million due to its poor theatrical returns. In North America, the film was an instant box office bomb. It opened on Friday, 5 June 2015, and grossed a mere $319 on its opening day from 10 theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Phoenix, Kansas City, Miami, Minneapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Philadelphia, followed by an even worse $288 on Saturday. For its three-day opening (Friday-to- Sunday), it grossed only $918‚Äîthe worst opening of all time for a film opening in 10 to 15 theatres in U.S. box office history. The FilmBar theater in Downtown Phoenix reported a gross of $9, indicating that only one person bought a ticket to see the film. The film was withdrawn from cinemas by its distributor, Screen Media Films, following its appalling opening weekend performance at the box office. In North America, it ended up becoming the lowest-grossing film of all time, surpassing the previous record held by I Kissed a Vampire ($1,380) in 2012. For the film's screening at the Zurich Film Festival on 5 October 2014, about 120 people paying $22.70 per ticket viewed the film in a 500-seat cinema. Overall, the highest revenue outside of North America came from Russia and the CIS (¬£144,000), Portugal (¬£4,000) and Serbia (¬£2,000), while the profits from Hungary, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine were minimal. In France, the film was released straight to DVD. Auburtin, in his first interview since the film's disastrous US opening in June 2015 told The Hollywood Reporter that he tried to strike a balance between \\"a Disney propaganda film [and] a Costa-Gavras/Michael Moore movie\\", but the project ultimately tipped in FIFA's favor. He added, \\"Now I'm seen as bad as the guy who brought AIDS to Africa or the guy who caused the financial crisis. My name is all over [this mess], and apparently I am a propaganda guy making films for corrupt people.\\" Roth, who has not seen the film and has declined repeated requests to speak about the film, confessed in May 2015, before the scandal broke, to German newspaper Die Welt: \\"Yeah, I apologize I didn't question the director, I didn't question the script\\", he said. \\"This is a role that will have my father turning in his grave\\". He admitted that he took the job for the money, saying it helped him out of a \\"financial hole\\", and added: \\"[B]ut you know what? The hole FIFA has dug for itself is so deep, they'll never get out of it\\". =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 0%, with an average rating of 1.01/10, based on 16 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 1 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". It is regarded as one of the worst films ever made. The film has been criticized for the poor quality of the drama, the unsuitability of the topic of administrative matters for a movie and the perceived biases of the film, with The Guardian describing it as \\"cinematic excrement\\" and \\"self- hagiography\\", and others calling it a \\"cringeworthy, self-aggrandizing affair\\", and \\"astonishingly crass\\". Several reviewers commented on the irony of the portrayal of Blatter in the film as an anti-corruption campaigner. Sara Stewart of the New York Post described it as \\"hilariously ill-timed\\", while Paul Field of the Daily Mirror said that this created \\"unintentional comedy gold\\". Writing in the London Evening Standard, Des Kelly described United Passions as \\"the worst movie ever made\\" and \\"the most extraordinary vanity exercise; a vile, self-aggrandizing, sugar-coated pile of manure where Blatter and Co. manage to make North Korea's Kim Jong-un look self-effacing\\".Sugar- coated FIFA film is spreading around Europe like a virus Des Kelly, London Evening Standard, 27 October 2014.

When Augouard was at Rennes he was a volunteer in the Siege of Paris of 1870‚Äì71. During this time he met Bishop Louis Gaston Adrien de S√©gur and learned the philosophy of being a Christian bishop. Augouard heard the story told by Antoine Horner of his missions in Zanzibar and East Africa, which motivated him to join the organization known as the Holy Ghost Fathers (C.S.Sp.). He then traveled to Africa in December 1877 as secretary to Bishop Le Berre, Vicar Apostolic of Gabon. In 1879, at age 27, Augouard went on an exploring expedition for about a month to the interior of central Africa. He arrived at Lake Nkunda (aka Malebo Pool) five days after the renowned Welsh journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley arrived there. Augouard is known for exploring the Congo and Ubangi Rivers, for which he was awarded a prize from the Paris Geographical Society. Augouard settled in Brazzaville in 1887. In 1890 he was appointed Bishop of Brazzaville and vicar apostolic of the Upper Congo and Oubangui. In the process of exploration he developed Christian mission stations along some of the Congo River. Because of his rapid expansion of missions he was nicknamed Diata- Diata, meaning 'quick-quick'.

History  The boundary marker was first established as a cairn of rocks in 1849 following the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. A white marble shaft was manufactured in New York, transported around Cape Horn on the USS Supply to San Diego, and erected and dedicated at the site in Imperial Beach in June, 1851. The marble monument was an obelisk about 20 feet (6 metres) in height, resting on a marble pedestal.

They describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex tasks composed of simple tasks, without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented. Behavior trees present some similarities to hierarchical state machines with the key difference that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state. Its ease of human understanding make behavior trees less error prone and very popular in the game developer community. Behavior trees have been shown to generalize several other control architectures. Mathematically, they are directed acyclic graphs. Behavior tree modelling the search and grasp plan of a two-armed robot.  Background  Behavior trees originate from the computer game industry as a powerful tool to model the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs). They have been extensively used in high-profile video games such as Halo, Bioshock, and Spore. Recent works propose behavior trees as a multi- mission control framework for UAV, complex robots, robotic manipulation, and multi-robot systems.Kl√∂ckner, Andreas. \\"Interfacing BTs with the World Using Description Logic.\\" In AIAA Guidance, Navigation and Control Conference, Boston, MA. 2013. Behavior trees have now reached the maturity to be treated in Game AI textbooks, as well as generic game environments such as Pygame and Unreal Engine (see links below). Behavior trees became popular for their development paradigm: being able to create a complex behavior by only programming the NPC's actions and then designing a tree structure (usually through drag and drop) whose leaf nodes are actions and whose inner nodes determine the NPC's decision making. Behavior trees are visually intuitive and easy to design, test, and debug, and provide more modularity, scalability, and reusability than other behavior creation methods. Over the years, the diverse implementations of behavior trees kept improving both in efficiency and capabilities to satisfy the demands of the industry, until they evolved into event-driven behavior trees. Event-driven behavior trees solved some scalability issues of classical behavior trees by changing how the tree internally handles its execution, and by introducing a new type of node that can react to events and abort running nodes. Nowadays, the concept of event- driven behavior tree is a standard and used in most of the implementations, even though they are still called \\"behavior trees\\" for simplicity.  Key concepts  A behavior tree is graphically represented as a directed tree in which the nodes are classified as root, control flow nodes, or execution nodes (tasks). For each pair of connected nodes the outgoing node is called parent and the incoming node is called child. The root has no parents and exactly one child, the control flow nodes have one parent and at least one child, and the execution nodes have one parent and no children. Graphically, the children of a control flow node are placed below it, ordered from left to right. The execution of a behavior tree starts from the root which sends ticks with a certain frequency to its child. A tick is an enabling signal that allows the execution of a child. When the execution of a node in the behavior tree is allowed, it returns to the parent a status running if its execution has not finished yet, success if it has achieved its goal, or failure otherwise. = Control flow node = A control flow node is used to control the subtasks of which it is composed. A control flow node may be either a selector (fallback) node or a sequence node. They run each of their subtasks in turn. When a subtask is completed and returns its status (success or failure), the control flow node decides whether to execute the next subtask or not.  Selector (fallback) node  Figure I. Graphical representation of a fallback composition of N tasks. Fallback nodes are used to find and execute the first child that does not fail. A fallback node will return immediately with a status code of success or running when one of its children returns success or running (see Figure I and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order of importance, from left to right. In pseudocode, the algorithm for a fallback composition is: 1 for i from 1 to n do 2 childstatus ‚Üê Tick(child(i)) 3 if childstatus = running 4 return running 5 else if childstatus = success 6 return success 7 end 8 return failure  Sequence node  Figure II. Graphical representation of a sequence composition of N tasks. Sequence nodes are used to find and execute the first child that has not yet succeeded. A sequence node will return immediately with a status code of failure or running when one of its children returns failure or running (see Figure II and the pseudocode below). The children are ticked in order, from left to right. In pseudocode, the algorithm for a sequence composition is: 1 for i from 1 to n do 2 childstatus ‚Üê Tick(child(i)) 3 if childstatus = running 4 return running 5 else if childstatus = failure 6 return failure 7 end 8 return success  Mathematical state space definition  In order to apply control theory tools to the analysis of behavior trees, they can be defined as three-tuple. T_i=\\\\\\\\{f_i,r_i, \\\\Delta t\\\\\\\\}, where i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} is the index of the tree, f_i: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}^n is a vector field representing the right hand side of an ordinary difference equation, \\\\Delta t is a time step and r_i: \\\\mathbb{R}^n \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{R_i,S_i,F_i\\\\\\\\} is the return status, that can be equal to either Running R_i, Success S_i, or Failure F_i. Note: A task is a degenerate behavior tree with no parent and no child. = Behavior tree execution = The execution of a behavior tree is described by the following standard ordinary difference equations: x_{k+t}(t_{k+1})=f_i( x_{k}(t_{k})) t_{k+1}=t_{k}+\\\\Delta t where k\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} represent the discrete time, and x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the state space of the system modelled by the behavior tree. = Sequence composition = Two behavior trees T_i and T_j can be composed into a more complex behavior tree T_0 using a Sequence operator. T_0=\\\\mbox{sequence}(T_i,T_j). Then return status r_0 and the vector field f_0 associated with T_0 are defined (for \\\\mathcal{S}_1) as follows: r_0(x_k) = \\\\begin{cases} r_j(x_k) & \\\\text{ if } x_k \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}_1 r_i(x_k) & \\\\text{ otherwise }. \\\\end{cases} f_0(x_k) = \\\\begin{cases} f_j(x_k) & \\\\text{ if } x_k \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}_1 f_i(x_k) & \\\\text{ otherwise }. \\\\end{cases}  See also  * Decision tree * Hybrid system * Subsumption architecture  References   External links  * ROS behavior tree library * Unreal Engine 4 behavior tree documentation * Behavior trees for AI: How they work * Behavior Trees: Simple yet Powerful AI for your Robot Category:Automata (computation) Category:Models of computation Category:Digital electronics Category:Artificial intelligence Category:Robot control Category:Automated planning and scheduling Category:Visual programming ","title":"Behavior tree (artificial intelligence, robotics and control)"},{"id":"43097039","text":"This is a summary of 1939 in music in the United Kingdom.

The group is alleged to be based in Atlacomulco and to have been very influential in the politics of Mexico State and the federal government. However, the most influential people linked to the group, such as Isidro Fabela, Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and Arturo Montiel have denied its existence or refused to confirm its existence. The group was considered to be one of the pillars of the PRI. Origins The name \\"Grupo Atlacomulco\\" was first used in local newspaper reports discussing the \\"men from Atlacomulco\\" who were beginning to dominate state and federal political posts. It is claimed that the group has its origins with the political connections of Maximino Montiel Olmos, the grand-uncle of Arturo Montiel Rojas; to people such as Lucindo C√°rdenas, Rafael Su√°rez Oca√±a and Silviano D√≠az Cid. However, the group as a widespread political force was established by Isidro Fabela. Fabela was governor of the State of Mexico from 1942 to 1945, during which time he started an educational movement which culminated in the Insitituto Cientifico Literario, today the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de M√©xico. He also founded several newspapers and was one of the founding members of the Ateneo de la Juventud. The Grupo Atlacomulco has operated mostly to get its members into high positions in both the state and federal governments. Fabela was instrumental in the political rise of Salvador S√°nchez Col√≠n, Alfredo del Mazo V√©lez and Carlos Hank Gonz√°lez from the 1950s to the 1970s. At one point in the 20th century, the group had members in various state governments in central Mexico and occupied key positions in the federal government. In the State of Mexico, it is estimated that 80% of government posts were held by members. Their influence even had one of their members nominated to become the first bishop of Toluca in the 1950s. However the influence of the Grupo began to diminish in the 1980s with the waning of the PRI. With the death of Hank in 2001, the group is now supposed to be leaderless, even though it is still alleged to be a strong force in politics and even to have connections to drug trafficking. The ex-president of Mexico (2012-2018) and former governor of the State of Mexico (2005-2011) Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, is rumored to be associated with the group due to this strong political ties with Arturo Montiel. Montiel was a candidate for the PRI presidential nomination in 1999, but lost due to scandal. He is considered to be the most important person in the group today. The Coordinator of Special Procedures of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Santiago Corcuera, has accused Grupo Atlacomulco of working against human rights in Mexico, by arguing against implementing human rights guarantees to groups such as criminals and women.

Life Baptised on 4 March 1830 at Boston, Lincolnshire, he was younger son of George Hill, merchant there, by his wife Betsy, daughter of Pishey Thompson. Educated at Boston grammar school, Hill in September entered as a divinity student the Unitarian New College, Manchester, where he studied under James Martineau. In June 1851 he completed the five years' course of study for the ministry, but he may never have preached. Meanwhile in 1848 he had matriculated at the University of London, and having graduated B.A. in the first class in 1851 acted from 1853 to 1855 as private tutor in the family of Dukinfield Darbishire of Manchester; the elder of his pupils, S. D. Darbishire, was subsequently known as the stroke of the Oxford University boat (1868‚Äì70), and afterwards practised as a doctor at Oxford. Somewhat later Hill became tutor in the family of Mrs. Salis Schwabe, also of Manchester. Hill is thought to have owed his introduction to journalism to Henry Dunckley and Richard Holt Hutton. On the death in 1861 of James Simms, editor of the Northern Whig, the journal of the Ulster liberals, he took up the post in Belfast; at the time, the American Civil War was influencing party politics at Westminster, and, alone of Irish journalists, Hill supported the Union. Through Martineau, Hill made the acquaintance of Harriet Martineau, then on the staff of the Daily News and like himself a staunch supporter of the northern states. He also came to know Henry Crabb Robinson, Robert Browning, and William Johnson Fox. At the suggestion of Frank Finlay, who was proprietor of the Northern Whig and his wife's brother, Hill was summoned at the end of 1865 to London to become assistant editor of the Daily News. Under John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, the Liberal Party was demanding measures that went further than the older Whig tradition, and Hill championed such a line. At the same time he wrote for the Saturday Review. On the retirement of Thomas Walker from the editorship of the Daily News in 1869, Edward Dicey filled the post for a few months; but Hill shortly succeeded Dicey, and then held the editorship for 17 years. The price had been reduced from threepence to one penny a year before he took the post. Hill continued to give steady support to William Ewart Gladstone's administration, and the journal became an influential party organ. Under Hill's editorship and the management of John Richard Robinson, the Daily News attained further influence and popularity. Hill collected a notable body of leader-writers: Peter William Clayden, Justin McCarthy, William Minto, John Macdonell, George Saintsbury, Andrew Lang, and later Herbert Paul. William Black the novelist. Sir Henry Lucy, and Frances Power Cobbe were occasional writers or auxiliary members of the staff. Hill himself wrote constantly, and had good political contacts. In 1886 Hill declined to accept Gladstone's Home Rule policy; and the proprietors abruptly sacked him (he returned the cheque for a year's salary sent by the proprietors on his retirement). By the end of the year he was the regular political leader-writer of The World, and held that post for twenty years. He became a frequent contributor to the Nineteenth Century. Hill was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1872, but never practised the law. He died suddenly at 13 Morpeth Terrace, Westminster, on 28 June 1910. By his will bequeathed 1000l. to the Boston grammar school, to found an exhibition from the school to any English university. Works While the Reform Bill 1866 was passing through Parliament, Hill contributed to a volume of essays, Questions for a Reformed Parliament (1867), an article on the political claims of Ireland. From his journalism he collected a series of Political Portraits, which was published separately in 1873 and went through several editions. A life of George Canning which he wrote for the English Worthies series (1881) was a lucid text on Canning's political aims and difficulties rather than a work of research. Hill contributed to the Fortnightly Review (1877‚Äì8) a scathing article on The Political Journeyings of Lord Beaconsfield; and to the Edinburgh Review (July 1887) an appreciative article on Mr. Gladstone and the Liberal Party. Family In June 1862 Hill married Jane Dalzell Finlay, daughter of the proprietor of the Northern Whig, and a contributor to its literary section of that paper; James Martineau officiated. After her marriage Jane Hill continued to write literary articles and reviews, mainly in the Saturday Review. She died in 1904.

Moving to Chicago, Illinois at a young age, he joined Wadsworth & Phelps, eventually rising to be senior partner as John V. Farwell & Co.. He was also a mentor and brief joint partner with Marshall Field, (1834-1906), in the firm Farwell, Field & Co. from 1862-1865, before Field moved on with other partners to eventually establish his own famous prototype of the modern department store at Marshall Field and Company. Farwell was a leader in several Christian philanthropic efforts including YMCA, the United States Christian Commission during the American Civil War, and was a believer and supporter of the evangelical works of Dwight L. Moody. Later, he served as an Indian agent and had large land holdings in Texas. He and his brother, Senator Charles B. Farwell, of Illinois, are the namesake of Farwell, Texas. Biography John Villiers Farwell was born on July 29, 1825 in Mead's Creek, Steuben County, New York. He was the brother of Charles B. Farwell, who would go on to become a United States Senator. When he was thirteen, his father moved the family to a farm in Ogle County, Illinois. Farwell attended Mount Morris Seminary and graduated in 1844. Farwell decided to head to Chicago, Illinois to seek employment. He worked in the office of the City Clerk of Chicago then joined the dry goods house of Hamilton & White as a bookkeeper. Farwell then took a position at Wadsworth & Phelps. Farwell trained several of Chicago's future prominent businessmen, including Marshall Field and Levi Leiter. Farwell married Abigail G. Taylor, the daughter of Ogle County farmer John G. Taylor, in 1851, but she died after two years. Farwell was named a partner in the firm, then known as Cooley, Wadsworth & Co., in 1850. He married Emeret C. Cooley in 1854; they had three sons and a daughter. In 1863, Farwell was named senior partner of the firm following the retirement of E. S. Wadsworth. In 1864, the company was restyled Farwell, Field & Co. after Marshall Field and Levi Leiter were admitted to the partnership. However, the next year, Field and Leiter left to join Potter Palmer in what would become Marshall Field & Co. Farwell's dry goods house then became known as John V. Farwell & Co. The company survived the 1871 Great Chicago Fire and was officially incorporated in 1891, when charge of the company was turned over to his sons. Farwell was an early leader in the history of YMCA, rising to become president of the Chicago chapter. Farwell probably met Dwight L. Moody through YMCA. He was named superintendent of Moody's Illinois Street Church in 1859, holding the position until 1867. He built the first church building for Moody on the corner of Illinois and Wells Streets in 1864. Farwell provided Moody with the financial backing needed to support the institution; Moody even lived in one of Farwell's YMCAs. Farwell was named a trustee of the Moody Bible Institute when it was founded in 1886. During the Civil War, Farwell was President of the Chicago Branch of the United States Christian Commission. A Republican, Farwell was a delegate from Illinois to the 1864 presidential election, supporting Abraham Lincoln. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant named Farwell to the Board of Indian Commissioners A group led by Farwell, his brother Charles, Abner Taylor, and A. C. Babcock was named responsible for constructing the Texas State Capitol in 1879. In exchange for his service as builder, the Farwells were paid with the largest cattle ranch in the world, the XIT Ranch. The Farwells oversaw a herd of over 150,000 cattle. The ranch proved relatively unprofitable, as cattle prices plunged in the late 1880s. By 1905, the land was mostly subdivided. Farwell was also a member of the Chicago Historical Society and the Union League Club. He died at his home in Lake Forest, Illinois on August 20, 1908 following a six-month illness. John V. Farwell & Co. maintained its name until it was purchased by Carson, Pirie & Co. in 1926.

It is a statue sculpted by Jonas Roces and is located at The Plaza, a park in front of the Calamba City Hall Complex along Bacnotan Road in the barangay of Real. President Benigno Aquino III led the unveiling of the monument on June 19, 2011. The monument was cited as the tallest Rizal monument in the world before former Laguna Governor Jeorge 'E.R.' Ejercito Estregan inaugurated a 26 feet bronze Rizal Monument sculpted by Toym Imao, son of National Artist for Sculpture Abdulmari Asia Imao in Santa Cruz, Laguna for the 2014 Palarong Pambansa hosted by the province.  Symbolisms  The statue depicts Rizal holding a book in his right hand and is made of bronze. It stands 22 feet (6.7 meters) which symbolizes the 22 languages and dialects Rizal mastered during his time such as Spanish, English, German, Japanese, Chinese and others. It is placed on top of a 2.8 meter podium consisting of 15-step stairway which symbolizes one decade since Rizal was born in 1861. It also has a granite pedestal of 7.87 feet and a 13.12 feet circular stairway base. The monument's total height is 43 feet (equivalent to a four-storey building) and its weight is 2 tons.  History  Inauguration of the Rizal Monument in 2011. The City Government of Calamba, through the leadership of then Mayor Joaquin Chipeco started the idea of building the tallest Rizal monument as a gift of the people of Calamba as a tribute to its greatest son. He realized that it is proper and fitting to have the tallest monument in honor of Rizal in his hometown. Together with the local government unit of Calamba, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) initilially funded the construction of the Rizal Monument. A young sculptor Jonas F. Roces from Marikina was commissioned to build the Rizal monument on December 2010. The original plan was to build a 16.4 feet monument. However, then Mayor Chipeco learned that the monument being sculpted is behind the current tallest Rizal monument in Nueva Vizcaya built by a Jordanian national. Three months before the official unveiling, the Rizal@150 Executive Committee increased the height of the monument to 22 feet. It was officially unveiled by President Benigno Aquino III on June 19, 2011 on the sesquicentennial birth anniversary of Rizal.

Its cartoons repeatedly attacked King Louis Philippe, whom it typically depicted as a pear. History The famous cartoon of Louis Philippe as a pear, drawn by Honor√© Daumier after the sketch by Charles Philipon and published in La Caricature in 1831 La Caricature morale, politique et litt√©raire was published from 1830 to 1843. Auguste Audibert was editor and Charles Philipon (1800‚Äì61) was director and main author. Honor√© de Balzac and Louis Desnoyers assisted Philipon in writing some of the magazines issues. Primary artists were Honor√© Daumier and Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard Grandville with caricature contributions from many artists including Henry Monnier, Alexandre Decamps, Auguste Raffet, Paul Gavarni, Achille Dev√©ria, Auguste Desperret, Eug√®ne Forest, Benjamin Roubaud. The journal was founded after the censorship laws had been relaxed following the July Revolution of 1830 in which Louis Philippe came to power. It covered both politics and art. 251 issues appeared between 1830 and 1835, each of four pages, with two or three lithographs. Philipon was the owner of the largest printing house in Paris equipped with lithographic presses, and used them to print La Caricature and Le Charivari, another illustrated paper. He drew together a group of skilled artists who mostly worked for these two papers, through which they attacked the king and the system of government with growing violence. The major contributors were Honor√© Daumier (1808‚Äì79) and Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard Grandville (1803‚Äì47), but there were many others. For example, a caricature by Jules David appeared in La Caricature of 31 May 1831. The king is depicted as an illusionist who uses the juste milieu and some poudre de non-intervention to make liberty and revolution vanish. In 1830‚Äì31 there were revolutionary uprisings in Italy. The Austrians intervened to suppress the revolts, and the French did nothing to prevent them. The Pope broke his promise to grant the rebels in the Papal States an amnesty. La Caricature published a cartoon that showed the Pope on his throne surrounded by corpses. Similarly, Philipon published cartoons that associated the French government with that of Tsar Nicholas I when Russia suppressed a revolt in Poland. The fall of Warsaw was announced by Horace Sebastiani, the French foreign minister, as \\"L'ordre r√®gne √† Varsovie\\" (Order reigns in Warsaw). The phrase was used as a caption for one of the cartoons. The journal became increasingly vocal in its opposition to Louis-Philippe, and was seized more than twelve times. The publishers were prosecuted, and Philipon was jailed for a year. In 1835 the government passed legislation that forced La Caricature to cease publication. The journal began publication again in 1838 and continued until 1843. Writing in 1840, William Makepeace Thackeray talked of the \\"curious contest between the State and M. Philipon's little army.\\" Thackery wrote, Travi√®s de Villers Contributors =Illustrations= Drawings and lithographies were contributed by the following artists, among others: * Victor Adam * Hippolyte Bellang√© * Nicolas Toussaint Charlet * Honor√© Daumier * Jules David * Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps * Auguste Desperret (or Desperet) * Achille Dev√©ria * Eug√®ne Forest * Paul Gavarni * Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard Grandville * Henry Monnier * Charles Philipon * Cl√©ment Pruche * Auguste Raffet * Benjamin Roubaud * Charles-Joseph Travi√®s de Villers = Articles = Some of the authors of articles were: * Ag√©nor Altaroche * Auguste Audibert * Honor√© de Balzac * Louis Desnoyers * Emmanuel Gonzalez * Louis Adrien Huart * Charles Philipon References Citations Sources  Category:1830 establishments in France Category:1843 disestablishments in France Category:Caricature Category:Defunct magazines published in France Category:Satirical magazines published in France Category:Magazines published in Paris Category:Weekly magazines published in France Category:Magazines established in 1830 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1843 ","title":"La Caricature (1830‚Äì1843)"},{"id":"43097193","text":"Live at the Rainbow is an album by Iron Maiden.

Portrayed by Galen Gering and created by Dena Higley, Rafe is introduced in 2008 as the FBI agent assigned to protect the troublesome Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) during her stay in witness protection. Sami and Rafe's contentious dynamic later develops into romance and the two fall in love and eventually marry. However, their romance is plagued by Sami's supercouple romance with Salem's resident badboy, EJ DiMera (James Scott). Rafe's disdain for the DiMera family grows when he discovers that EJ is behind the kidnapping and presumed death of Sami's daughter Sydney and EJ's father Stefano (Joseph Mascolo) replaces Rafe with a doppelganger. The series also introduces Rafe's younger sisters, Arianna (Lindsay Hartley) and Gabi (Camila Banus) and later his younger brother Dario (Jordi Vilasuso). Rafe is very protective of his siblings having helped raise them when their father abandoned the family. Rafe also has an affair with Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) putting him at odds with Stefano, Kate's ex-husband. He later falls in love with physical therapist Jordan Ridgeway (Chrishell Stause) whom he tries to help overcome her own dark past. In 2015, Rafe is forced to confront his past when his estranged father Eduardo (A Martinez) resurfaces. Rafe later falls in love with his longtime colleague Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) and supports her when she loses her true love to a brain tumor. When a grief- stricken Hope murders Stefano, Rafe helps her cover it up. Storylines In October 2008, Federal Agent Rafe arrived in Salem to relay information to Sami Brady and her guard, who had been assigned to her as part of the witness protection program. As Sami had become increasingly agitated by her isolation, she had slipped sleeping pills to her guard and knocking her unconscious. As a result, Rafe was permanently assigned to guard Sami, with whom he initially had a combative relationship. As time went on, however, Rafe and Sami began to form a friendship. While Rafe kept fairly quiet about his personal life, he did tell Sami that as a young child, he frequented a local convent due to his troubling behavior. Rafe became one of the very few people to learn that Sami was pregnant with the child of E.J. DiMera (James Scott), and agreed to help her conceal this fact. As time went on, Rafe began to develop feelings for Sami and after her stint in Witness Protection ended, he pursued a position within the Salem Police Department so he might remain close to Sami and her baby. Rafe also began to reconnect with his younger sister, Arianna (then Felisha Terrell), who had concerns over his involvement with Sami. Despite Arianna's disapproval, Rafe continued to pursue Sami and asked her if he could legally adopt her baby, who they had named Grace. Tragically, several months later, Grace died from complications due to bacterial meningitis, leaving Sami and Rafe utterly devastated. Following Grace's death, Sami began to observe an emotional distance in Rafe and came to discover him at the graveside of a woman named Emily Hudson. Rafe revealed to Sami that he was once engaged to marry Emily, but she died on the day of their wedding in a tragic accident. When Sami began to investigate Rafe's past, which he would not elaborate upon, she turned up very little. Shortly afterwards, Emily's vengeful sister Meredith arrived in Salem, and after kidnapping Rafe, she attempted to kill him as she held him responsible for Emily's death. Rafe was rescued by Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell), who had recently returned to Salem following over fifteen years away. Following his recovery, Rafe began to investigate Nicole Walker (Arianne Zuker), as he developed a theory that she had switched Grace with Sami's biological child. After collecting DNA samples from Sami, and the child, Sydney, Rafe was able to perform a DNA test and confirm that Sydney was in fact Sami's daughter. With Nicole's scheme exposed, she responded by abducting Sydney and leaving Salem. While she was on the run, Nicole encountered Anna Fredericks (Leann Hunley), who in turn kidnapped Sydney from Nicole. Anna began sending ransom notes to Sami, threatening her not involve the police. As a result, Sami began confiding in E.J. and leaving Rafe in the dark, resulting in Rafe ending their relationship. Despite the end of his relationship with Sami, Rafe continued to investigate Sydney's abduction and became convinced that Anna was working alongside E.J. Despite his efforts to convince Anna to turn on E.J., Rafe was unsuccessful. By chance, Rafe observed a suspicious conversation between E.J. and Nicole on the Salem Pier that seemed to strengthen his theory. Rafe became convinced that E.J. had confessed his involvement in the abduction to Nicole and could somehow persuade her to reveal his involvement. In an effort to gain her confession, Rafe attempted to convince Nicole he was interested in her. After a few drinks at The Cheatin' Heart, Nicole and Rafe headed back to her apartment, and stopped short of sleeping together. He remained the night anyway, and used this time to search Nicole's apartment for evidence to incriminate E.J. in Sydney's abduction, eventually stumbling upon a recording of E.J. admitting to paying Anna to kidnap Sydney. Rafe confronted Nicole with the recording, and assured her immunity from prosecution should she authenticate the recording. During Rafe's investigation into Sydney's kidnapping, E.J. and Sami had reconnected and were engaged to be married. On their wedding day, Rafe aired the recording of E.J.'s confession at their ceremony, resulting in Sami leaving E.J. Rafe and Sami reunited, resulting in him proposing to her. As they spent the night together, Sami snuck out intent on confronting E.J., whom she found unconscious and holding a gun. Sami used the gun to shoot E.J. in the head, and then proceeded to toss it into the river. When Sami's uncle, Bo Brady (Peter Reckell) questioned her about E.J.'s shooting, Rafe insisted that Sami was with him at the time of the shooting. Sami confessed her involvement in E.J.'s shooting to Rafe, and despite his dedication to the law, Rafe handed in his resignation to the FBI and swore to protect Sami at all costs. E.J. soon discovered Sami's guilt in his shooting, and began blackmailing her for sole custody of their two children, Johnny and Sydney. If she refused his demands, he would turn her, as well as Rafe and her eldest son, Will Horton (then Chandler Massey) in as accessories to attempted murder. With her back against the wall, a devastated Sami agreed to E.J.'s demands. Rafe assured Sami that he would do whatever he had to help her regain custody of the children, and in order to have one last happy memory before the hard times to follow, suggested they have the wedding that night. Sami agreed, and she and Rafe were married on November 24, 2010. Following their wedding, Rafe joined the Salem Police Department and began investigating E.J, hoping to uncover evidence against him and send him to prison. Rafe's investigation was quickly stalled, when it was discovered that Johnny had cancer. Rafe stood by Sami throughout the cancer ordeal, especially when Johnny needed to have one of his eyes removed. Johnny's cancer was discovered to have spread to his remaining eye, but as the doctors had caught it in time, they were able to treat it and spare his vision. With Johnny's crisis averted, E.J. began to allow Sami back into her children's lives. However, Rafe continued to remain in E.J.'s crosshairs. In fact EJ and Stefano had Rafe kidnapped and replace with imposter of Rafe. He lost his memory after Stefano drug him and whipping his memory however Rafe escape and got back to Sami revealing what EJ and his father did. They capture the fake Rafe and held him so they could get informal. Later Bo and Hope, Rafe and Sami expose the whole scheme. EJ gave full custody of the kids to Sami. Rafe was fired from the Salem Police Department by Roman. After being fired Rafe wrongly believe Austin got him fired which cause problems between Austin and Rafe and Sami and Carrie. Later there was a shooting at the Brady pub and Johnny went missing but Rafe would find him later on with Will. After Rafe and Carrie started working in John's case after that Rafe and Carrie would started an investigation business. The two started develop feelings for each other and was getting closer. Rafe and Carrie would share a kiss that Sami would walk in on them. Which cause even more problems between Rafe and Sami than Rafe would found out EJ and Sami slept together. Rafe attack EJ and told Nicole, Rafe would leave Sami after his marriage ended. Rafe pursue a relationship with Carrie who was still married to Austin. However Rafe found out Nicole was pregnant with EJ child. Rafe volunteer to help keep EJ from Nicole's baby and did not waste anytime getting involved. Even Rafe lied and said the baby was his which was not too long after Rafe discovery that Sami cheat on him with EJ. However Carrie overhear Rafe's clam and would go back to Austin. However Rafe continue to pursue Carrie which lead to them be tapped in a safe house with a bomb. Where Rafe admit that Nicole's baby was EJ. Carrie ask why he lied and Rafe said, because he hates EJ. The two kissed passionately before escaping. But Carrie end up being pregnant with Austin's baby and two ended up leaving town.

Shortly after Rafe was beaten to near death by Nick Fallon formal cell mate Jensen. Having survived the ordeal, Rafe was in a brief coma. Stefano found out about the affair and ordered Joe Bernardi go to Rafe's room to emasculate and castrate Rafe's genitalia, but luckily Sami was already in the bathroom in his room and then pulled out a gun shooting Bernardi and saving Rafe from any harm. Later Rafe woke up and started recovery while developed feelings for his physio therapist Jordan Ridgeway (Chrishell Strauss). The relationship only lasted a few months until Rafe drunkenly slept with Kate, who still had strong feelings for Rafe. Upon Jordan's departure, Rafe remained single. After Gabi killed Nick Fallon, she was sent to prison, devastating Rafe. Meanwhile. Rafe's father (A. Martinez) returned to Salem as well as Gabi, followed by his mother and brother. Rafe was surprised to find his father fathered a daughter Paige Larson (True O'brien). Unfortunately Paige was murdered by the Salem Necktie killer. Rafe stood by Hope when Aiden, now her husband tried to kill her, posing as the neck tie killer. Hope was devastated and when Bo Brady returned, Bo revealed he was ill. Upon sharing this news Bo had a special request for Rafe. His request was to take special care of Hope and their children. Rafe reluctantly agreed. After Bo's death, Rafe began to develop feelings for Hope. When Hope had a breakdown and killed Stefano, Rafe helped her cover up the crime. Rafe even went as far as to frame Andre Dimera for murder of Stefano Dimera. After Rafe and Hope engaged in a relationship. They began to fall for one another but it was short lived when Aiden returned, and it was proven that he was not the one who had tried to kill Hope. He had claimed to have been switched out with a doppelg√§nger right after he proposed to her. In reality, he had originally planned on killing Hope for the insurance money so he could pay back his debts. He owed Andre a lot of money and Andre had threatened to kill Aiden's son Chase if Aiden did not kill Hope. Even so, when the time to kill Hope came, Aiden found himself unable to go through with it. He tried to leave, and that is when he was knocked out and a doppelg√§nger was sent in his place to do the job while Aiden himself was held prisoner by Andre. Hope, still in love with Aiden, broke things off with Rafe. Rafe was saddened but the two stayed friends. Rafe began investigating Aiden's story, only to discover that though Aiden had not been able to go through with it, he had originally planned to kill Hope. Aiden had not told Hope that part. He has lied about the doppelg√§nger time frame. When Rafe attempted to prove it, he was strapped to a bomb by Andre's men and held in an old house. Hope discovered the truth in time and rushed to Rafe's side. The two reconciled and escaped the dangerous situation. Aiden attempted to blackmail Hope, angering Rafe. The trio went back and forth before Aiden finally realized he loved Hope too much to blackmail her and he left town. Rafe and Hope were happy in their relationship before the truth about Stefano's death came out. The revelation sent Hope into police custody, and she was sentenced to life in prison, breaking Rafes heart. Later evidence come out that Stefano and that he set up Hope. So Rafe, Steven, Marlena, Paul and Kalyla Search for Stefano, eventually they caught Stefano. However it turn out that it was Shane Donovan disguise as Stefano and the real Stefano was dead all along. It was all a part of Steve and Shane's plan to free Hope from prison. Hope was freed and Rafe was overjoyed. In July 2017, Rafe proposed to Hope and she accepted. He cheated on her with Sami and lied about it until after their marriage. Hope found out about it the day after their marriage and left him. They are currently separated, but trying to work it out. Development =Casting and creation= In late August 2008, rumors circulated that former Passions star Galen Gering, known for his role of Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald was in-talks to join the cast of Days. However, news of Gering's casting was not formally announced until late September 2008. Gering would take on the newly-created role of FBI agent Rafael. Gering made his first appearance on October 31, 2008. \\"It took longer that I had anticipated,\\" Gering said of the casting process. Forbes March, known for his role as Nash Brennan on One Life to Live, and Wes Ramsey also auditioned for the role. Gering signed onto the series a few months after shooting his final episode of Passions. While Gering comes from both Jewish and Spanish heritage, he is usually cast in Latino roles. Gering said he didn't not mind being typecast. \\"It's paying the bills!\\" Executive producer Ken Corday was unfamiliar with Gering's work so he had to audition for the role but co-executive producer, Gary Tomlin \\"championed\\" his casting. Gering and Tomlin worked together on Passions when Tomlin for the series. The actor admitted that he didn't know much about Rafe, but had a meeting Tomlin who assured him that his potential storyline would be a \\"great\\" one. Gering said of his casting, \\"When I joined the soap, it was a weird time at DAYS\\" as the series had just fired their biggest stars in Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. They were also unsure of if they'd even still be on the air. Gering noted the irony in returning to the set because he had auditioned for Passions on the set of Days of Our Lives. Gering said of his initial plans for the character, \\"I didn't want Rafe to be this one-note FBI guy. I wanted him to be quirky.\\" However, he didn't have time to have much input because of how fast the swift production style. He described the character as a \\"great marriage of acting and writing.\\" In contrast to Passions, Gering said, \\"It‚Äôs clear and concise and well driven and well written, but I really like this character, Rafe.\\" =Relationships= The character of Rafe was first paired with Sweeney's Sami Brady. Gering appreciated the slow burn pacing of the romance. \\"I think they did a great job allowing the audience to see Sami and Rafe fall in love.\\" \\"I always liked her personality and her spunky fire, so I'm really excited to be working with her\\" Gering said of his costar. Rafe is forced to be Sami's new bodyguard in witness protection after she sabotages the first two. However, Sami's usual scheming behavior does not fly with Rafe. Gering said \\"Sami's definitely met her match.\\" Their contentious relationship eventually blossoms into romance, and the duo eventually marries in November 2010. Gering said \\"I think they are soul-mates.\\" Rafe and Sami \\" each other very well and support one another.\\" He continued, \\"I think they definitely have what it takes to last long-term.\\" However, most of their relationship is plagued by Sami's longstanding romance with EJ DiMera (James Scott), the kidnapping and presumed deaths of two of her children, and when EJ's father, Stefano (Joseph Mascolo) replaces Rafe with a doppelganger. Sami and Rafe eventually break up over a disagreement with Nick and Gabi raising Will's baby, causing her to run to EJ. Reception Dan J. Kroll said Gering's introduction would provide comfort for fans of the cancelled Passions. Gering's debut was mostly well received by viewers. Nelson Branco was \\"worried\\" when Gering joined the cast but Rafe soon become one of his favorite characters. Branco likened the character to Peter Reckell's legendary Bo Brady as the resident hero of the series. By 2011, Gering had solidified his place as a \\"fan favorite.\\" Hayley Farb said \\"Galen Gering has portrayed every woman's prince charming.\\" Farb also praised Gering's portrayal of Rafe's doppelg√§nger. \\"His underestimated talent reached new heights through his dual role.\\" References External links *Rafe at soapcentral.com Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Fictional Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel Category:Fictional American police officers Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Rafe Hernandez"},{"id":"43097328","text":"Louise Broadfoot (born 26 February 1978 in Melbourne) is an Australian former cricket player.

The park provides access to a dedication monument at or near the birthplace of John Marshall. Description Monument at John Marshall birthplace The park consists of parking and picnic areas on Germantown Road in Midland, Virginia, a walking trail to the birthplace monument and the monument near the site of John Marshall's birth with an adjacent picnic shelter. Interpretive signs near the park entrance and trail head give a brief educational description of John Marshall's life. The walking trail follows the path of a small stream for approximately half a mile (.8 km)References state the trail length as from .5 to .75 miles (.8 to 1.2 km). Some travel guides incorrectly give the distance as .25 miles (.4 km). The distance to the monument is approximately .75 miles from the parking area, approximately .5 miles from the trail head marker at the back of the main picnic area of the park to the monument near the site of the residence where Marshall was born. History Thomas Marshall, John Marshall's father, moved to Germantown with his new wife in 1754.See here for maps of where the Marshall land was located within Germantown. John Marshall was born the following year in a substantial -story structure described as \\"similar to the 1724 Tilman Weaver house\\" rather than a log cabin. left A marker was erected at the home site by the Marshall chapter of the Phi Delta Phi legal fraternity at George Washington University in 1902. That marker was enclosed by a larger monument in 1928. John Marshall Birthplace Park was Fauquier County's first public park. The park was dedicated on June 8, 1978. The plaque on the Marshall birthplace monument states, \\"Near this spot on September 4, 1755, was born John Marshall\\". The location of the marker and monument were based on oral history so the location of the house was in doubt. Researchers from the William and Mary Center for Archaeological Research, College of William and Mary, conducted background research and a limited on- site survey and testing in July 2005. Eighteenth-century domestic artifacts found at the site and background research support the site as the likely location of the dwelling of the Marshall family at the time of John Marshall's birth. Birding and wildlife The trail to the monument is listed as a part of Virginia's birding and wildlife trail system. The park is notable for the presence of tawny emperor and Eastern tiger swallowtail butterflies and a variety of resident and migratory birds that may be observed along the trail and adjoining agricultural fields.

Life Born on 2 November 1828 at Witham, Essex, he was the second son of eight children of Richard Robinson, a congregational minister. His wife Sarah was the daughter of John Dennant, also a congregational minister, of Halesworth, Suffolk. At eleven he entered the school for the sons of congregational ministers at Lewisham. Withdrawn from school on 26 June 1843, he was apprenticed to a firm of booksellers at Shepton Mallet. His first effort towards journalism was a descriptive account (in the Daily News 14 February 1846) of a meeting of Wiltshire labourers to protest against the Corn Laws. After reporting for the Bedford Mercury, he obtained a post on the Wiltshire Independent at Devizes, and sent regular reports of the local markets to the Daily News. In 1848 Robinson went to London. Having become a unitarian, he was made sub-editor of a Unitarian journal, The Inquirer, and did most of the work for John Lalor, the editor. His next post was on the Weekly News and Chronicle, under John Sheehan, and in 1855 he became editor of the Express, an evening paper under the same management as the Daily News. At the same time he was a prolific contributor elsewhere. He followed the revolutionary movements of Europe, and was in contact with Giuseppe Mazzini after writing an appreciation. He also knew Lajos Kossuth, Giuseppe Garibaldi, and other leaders. In 1868, when the price of the Daily News was reduced to one penny, Robinson was appointed manager, and turned the paper around. He saw that the public demanded news not only quickly but in an attractive form. At the opening of the Franco-Prussian War he instructed his correspondents to telegraph descriptive details and not merely bare facts, and after the war was in progress he brought in Archibald Forbes, who became a valuable contributor. At the prompting of another correspondent, John Edwin Hilary Skinner, he started the \\"French Peasants Relief Fund\\", which reached a total of ¬£20,000. On 16 June 1876 Edwin Pears of Constantinople contributed to the Daily News the first of a series of letters, which appeared on 23 June, describing the Batak massacre and other atrocities. Robinson sent out an American journalist, Januarius Aloysius MacGahan, who was accompanied by Eugene Schuyler, the American consul-general in Turkey, to make inquiries. Pears's charges were corroborated. In 1887 Robinson became titular editor, the actual night editing being carried on chiefly by Peter William Clayden. In 1893 he was knighted on the recommendation of William Ewart Gladstone. The fortunes of the News meanwhile declined. During the Second Boer War in South Africa (1899‚Äì1902), Robinson's sympathies were with the Boers. The proprietors changed the policy of the paper to a support of the war, without restoring its prosperity. Then the policy was again reversed by new proprietors, but Robinson resigned in February 1901. Robinson died in London on 30 November 1903, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Associations Robinson was a Reform Club member, and associated with the circle of James Payn, William Black, Sir Wemyss Reid, and George Augustus Sala. He was a regular \\"first night\\" visitor to theatres. In 1854 he became a professional member of the Guild of Literature and Art, a society which was founded by Charles Dickens and his friends for the benefit of authors and artists. The guild failed, however, to fulfil the aims of its founders, and Robinson with Frederick Clifford, as the last surviving trustees, arranged for its dissolution in 1897. In 1897 he was chairman of the Newspaper Press Fund dinner, and in 1898 of the Newspaper Society dinner; the former body represented journalists, and the latter proprietors. Family Robinson married on 14 July 1859 Jane Mapes (died 1876), youngest daughter of William Granger of the Grange, Wickham Bishops, Essex; by her he had one son and one daughter. He was also a paternal uncle of the notable British writer and journalist, Bertram Fletcher Robinson.

Consisting of twenty species of bats, among a variety of invertebrates, the gallery allows visitors to learn about bats behaviour and biology, through engaging in various educational panels, videos and models. It is currently located on the second level, of the Philosophers Walk Wing in the ROM‚Äôs Heritage Building. History The bat cave was originally built in the 1980s as a replica of the 3 km St. Clair Cave in Jamaica. In the early 2000s however, the Royal Ontario Museum received a grant to renovate the cave among two new Roman and Byzantine Galleries. Thus updated sound effects, dim lighting, and rock models were incorporated to make the cave appear more realistic. Today the exhibit stands at 1700 square feet. With over 300 new wax models of bats and bugs that are even more authentic than before, visitors now also have an opportunity to see bald pink baby bats, amidst an eerie dark backdrop that has been come to be known as the nursery cave. Bat Cave Experience Areas =Explore the World of Bats= Prior to entering the mouth of the Bat Cave is a series of panels addressing various common questions and curiosities concerning bats and their natural habitat. Guests learn about how bats navigate in the dark, how they see, how they travel through the dark and if they are similar to humans. In addition guests learn about their current patterns of behaviour, eating habitats among many other things presented on in formats on the wall. At the Cave Mouth there are a variety of other descriptions which historicize how the cave was modeled after the St. Clair Cave in Jamaica. The panel‚Äôs presents a detailed account of what the cave look, sounds and smells like. It informs the visitors of the kinds of insects and bats they would see if they were to visit the cave. There is also a Bat Cave Field Guide which helps visitors identify the six species of bats they may encounter in the cave. =Inside the Bat Cave= Within the bat cave lies a variety of bats, cockroaches and other invertebrates which simulate a realistic portrayal of the St. Clair Cave in Jamaica. There are currently the following areas in the cave: *Fruit Bat Roosting Area *The Grooming Area *The Cavern: is described as a natural theatre within the Bat Cave where visitors can watch an audio visible presentation that elaborates on the specifics of the cave. *The Bat Nursery *The Bat Exodus Events at the Royal Ontario Museum *Bat Month: In March 2010, the Royal Ontario offered a variety of live bat demonstrations, costumes crafts and other educational activities to celebrate the reopening of the Bat Cave Exhibit. Presenters like Bill ‚ÄúBat Boy‚Äù Scully, African Lion Safari, and Dr. Paul Faure of the McMaster Bat Lab all presented a variety of interactive and informational experiences. *Food Studio Caf√©: In partnership with the Food Studio Caf√©, the Royal Ontario Museum offered a variety of bat themed meals such as ‚Äúbat wings chicken wing special‚Äù to promote the new exhibit. *Youth Patron‚Äôs Circles (YPC) also hosted their fifth annual fundraiser PROM v Noir at the exhibit in March 2010.

Since 1907, it has been a fixture of the Columbia University campus in Manhattan, New York City. Description The Great God Pan, front and back, in 1902 The sculpture depicts the Greek god Pan, a half- man, half-goat deity associated with pastoral living, rustic music, and carnality. Barnard's Pan is mature and strongly muscled, with a long tangled beard, the ears and cloven hooves of a goat, but no horns or tail. He reclines lazily on his side atop a rock, playing his reed pipe and dangling one hoof over the edge of the rock. The bronze sculpture is approximately tall, long, and wide. It weighs . Its green granite base is high, long, and wide. The inscription on the back reads: \\"George Grey Barnard ‚Äì Sculptor\\". The inscription on the right front corner reads: \\"Geo. Gray Barnard / Sc. 1899. Cast in one piece by / Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company / Founders New York 1899,\\" and is accompanied by the founder's mark. History Barnard conceived the sculpture in 1894. Originally it was intended to be a fountain sculpture for the courtyard of The Dakota, a luxury apartment building on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Alfred Corning Clark, an heir to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune, was Barnard's most important early patron. Clark's father had built The Dakota, and bequeathed the building to Clark's teenage son Edward in 1882.Birmingham, Stephen. (1996). Life at the Dakota: New York's Most Unusual Address, Syracuse University Press, pp. 30‚Äì31. Clark visited Paris in 1895 and commissioned Barnard to proceed with the larger-than-life-size sculpture, but it was never installed at The Dakota. Alfred Corning Clark died unexpectedly at age 51 in April 1896. His family privately offered Pan to the city in November 1896, to be the centerpiece of a fountain in Central Park: > The \\"Pan,\\" which was sketched in Paris, but executed in this country, the > plaster cast forming part of the exhibit at Logerot Gardens, was ordered by > Mr. Clark for the court of the Dakota flats; but convinced that this superb > work of art should belong to the public, he directed his heirs to present it > to the city, on the condition that it be placed in Central Park, the Clark > estate paying all expenses of casting and erection.Laura Carroll Dennis, \\"A > Great American Sculptor\\", The American Monthly Review of Reviews, vol. 19, > no. 1 (January 1899), p. 51. The city's Art Commission approved acceptance of the gift, but the city's Parks Commission spent six months debating the suitability of the work and considering various Central Park locations before declining the Clark family's offer. The New York Evening Telegram published a June 10, 1897, cartoon entitled \\"The Two Orphans\\", which lampooned Barnard's Pan and Frederick William MacMonnies's Bacchante and Infant Faun, the latter having been rejected for the Boston Public Library the year before. Edward Severin Clark, continuing his late father's support for Barnard's work, funded the casting of Pan in bronze and loaned the bronze cast to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and international expositions.\\"Great Goat Man Has a History of Mythic Proportions\\", , Columbia Daily Spectator, April 11, 2008. =Bronze casting= Laughing Faun, 1896 Barnard wanted his plaster sculpture cast in bronze in a single piece‚Äîas opposed to assembled from separately-cast pieces‚Äîbut could not find a French foundry willing to attempt it. French-born Eugene F. Aucaigne, manager of the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company of Mount Vernon, New York, took on the challenge. Following months of preparation and construction of an extremely complex and heavy mold, Aucaigne oversaw the successful casting of Pan in bronze in August 1898. It was the largest bronze sculpture cast in a single piece in the United States at that time.Harold E. Dickson, \\"The Other Orphan\\", The American Art Journal, vol. 1, no. 2 (Autumn 1969), pp. 108‚Äì118. Barnard's plaster model for the sculpture's base featured a rock surrounded by reeds and cattails, with a standing crane to visually balance Pan's head. He also modeled Laughing Faun, a small mask to cover the water spouts around the sculpture's base. The idea of Pan as a fountain sculpture was abandoned following the Parks Commission's rejection; Barnard's base was never cast in bronze, and the faun masks were not used. Barnard tried to manipulate the Parks Commission into reconsidering its rejection of Pan, presenting the sculpture's placement in Central Park as a fait accompli in a national magazine. When the commission balked at this, a boulder fronting on Central Park Lake was proposed as an alternative site. The commission dithered for four more years, before again rejecting Pan for Central Park. =Exhibitions= Barnard included the plaster cast of Pan in his first one- man exhibition, held in November 1898 under the glass roof of the Logerot Hotel winter garden, at Fifth Avenue and 18th Street in New York City. The bronze Pan was loaned for a year to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, beginning in spring 1899. The Great God Pan at the Exposition Universelle (1900), Paris (bottom left) Barnard exhibited Pan and Struggle of the Two Natures in Man at the Exposition Universelle in Paris from April to November 1900. The bronze Pan was installed outdoors along the Champs-√âlys√©es, and the marble Two Natures inside the Petit Palais des Beaux-Arts. He was awarded a Gold Medal for the two sculptures. Barnard exhibited Pan and Two Natures at the Pan- American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, from May to November 1901.Art Hand Book: Official Handbook of Architecture and Sculpture and Catalogue to the Pan-American Exposition (Buffalo, NY: David Gray, publisher, 1901), p. 79. The bronze Pan was installed in front of the art gallery and the marble Two Natures within the gallery. He was awarded a Gold Medal for the two sculptures.Pan-American Exposition, Catalogue of the Exhibition of Fine Arts, (Buffalo, NY: David Gray, publisher, 1901), p. ix. In November 1902, the bronze Pan was among the four works shown by Barnard at the National Sculpture Society exhibition at Madison Square Garden, New York City. The bronze Pan was exhibited at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, as part of an industrial display inside the Palace of Manufactures. The Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company was awarded a Gold Medal for its accomplishment in casting the sculpture,Hampton L. Carson, Report and Official Opinions of the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, (Harrisburg, PA: State Printer, 1907), p. 622. but Barnard was not recognized for Pan artistic merit. The plaster cast of Pan was included in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston's one-man exhibition of Barnard's work, November‚ÄìDecember 1908. =Columbia University= Fountain of the Great God Pan, Columbia College, 1918 Following the second rejection of Pan for Central Park, Edward Clark and his mother donated the bronze sculpture to Columbia College (now Columbia University). The sculpture was placed upon a green-granite Neoclassical base with three bronze lion-head water spouts for use as a fountain. Charles Follen McKim, of McKim, Meade & White, designed the architectural setting for Pan: a \\"D\\"-shaped granite fountain basin, circular pool, stepped platform, and exedra (curved stone bench). The Pan Fountain was installed in 1907 on The Green at Amsterdam Avenue and 120th Street, then the northeast corner of the campus.The Great God Pan (sculpture), from Smithsonian Institution Research Information System. The sculpture inspired a poem by Ralph Perry, editor of the 1916 yearbook, The Columbian: In 1959, to make way for construction of the Seeley W. Mudd Engineering Building,\\"Pan Statue Headed for New Location\\" , Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CVII, Number 1, 18 September 1962, p. 7. Columbia relocated the Pan statue and its granite base‚Äîbut not its architectural setting and fountain‚Äîto Amsterdam Avenue and 119th Street. It was relocated again in 1963, to a courtyard between Fayerweather and Avery Halls. To make way for a 1975 expansion of Avery Hall, Pan was relocated to its current site: north of West 116th Street, between Lewisohn Hall and the Low Memorial Library.

It contains medieval murals and several medieval furnishings, and belongs to the Church of Sweden. History and architecture The presently visible church was preceded by an older, Romanesque church. Of this church, only the tower, built in the 12th century and heightened in the 14th, remains. A few stone sculptures have also been re-used in the later church, e.g. one sculpture depicting a dragon and another a lion. These are now immured in the southern fa√ßade of the church. The rest of the church dates from the 13th century (the choir and sacristy) and the early 14th (the nave). The building material of the church is limestone. Apart from the aforementioned Romanesque sculptures, the exterior of the church is also adorned with sculpted portals, both Romanesque and Gothic in style. Internally, the church is decorated with medieval murals made by the artist known as the Master of the Passion of Christ in the middle of the 15th century. The paintings were uncovered during a renovation in 1915. The church also have several preserved stained glass window panes, one of only a few cases of medieval stained glass in Sweden still in its original location. The altarpiece is furthermore medieval, from the late 14th century, as is a preserved church tabernacle. The triumphal cross dates from circa 1300, and the baptismal font, possibly made by the artist Hegvald, is a Romanesque piece from the 12th century, richly decorated. The church lies in a cemetery that is surrounded by a low limestone wall, in which a medieval lychgate still survives.

He wrote regularly for the Evening Standard, Queen magazine, the Daily Mail and Sunday Mirror, among others. Crewe travelled much of the world, writing 11 books on the subject of his journeys, biographies and cuisine, including an expedition to the \\"empty quarter\\" of Saudi Arabia. Crewe was co-proprietor of various restaurants, including the now-defunct Brasserie St. Quentin in Knightsbridge, London.  Early life  Crewe was born Quentin Hugh Dodds in 1926, the second son of Major (James) Hugh Hamilton Dodds, CMG, a career diplomat (amongst other postings, Consul-General at Nice),http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/crewe1911.htmThe New Extinct Peerage 1884‚Äì1971: Containing Extinct, Abeyant, Dormant and Suspended Peerages With Genealogies and Arms, L. G. Pine, Heraldry Today, 1972, page 90 and Lady Annabel Crewe-Milnes, the daughter of the Marquess of Crewe. In 1945 his family changed their name to Crewe after his mother inherited what remained of Lord Crewe's estates. His older half-brother, Terence O'Neill, was a politician who served as the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland from 1963 to 1969. Crewe was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy at age 6 and a doctor predicted he would be dead by 16 years old. He was not told this. His father was keen that he should be a sportsman, and tried to teach him to shoot, fence or ride, without any success. Crewe would regularly fall over. During Crewe's early childhood, his father was British Consul in Sicily, before being transferred to the French Riviera when his friendship with Haile Selassie made it impossible to remain in Italy. With his parents living abroad, Quentin spent much of his childhood in the care of various relatives in England. He was educated at Eton, where he was expelled after copying a fire door key and secretly going to London for a day. He went on to Trinity College, Cambridge to study law and economics, but spent so much time partying that he was expelled for indolence. He was falling over so much that he took to walking with a stick, although he did achieve sporting success as a cox. Crewe's condition steadily deteriorated until he was using a wheelchair full-time by age 29. Crewe was married three times: in 1956, to Martha Sharp, with whom he had a son and a daughter; in 1961, to Angela Huth, with whom he had a son and a daughter; and in 1970, to Sue Cavendish, with whom he had a son and a daughter.https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-quentin- crewe-1185256.html Career Crewe is credited with inventing the modern restaurant review,https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/restaurants/one-critic- too-many-7435192.html which is not only about the food but aims to entertain as well as inform. He notoriously described Wilton's restaurant on Jermyn Street as where the aristocracy were served nursery food by waitresses dressed as nannies.

Raj graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from Carleton University in 1975, and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, following two friends, both trans women activists who had been involved in the Association of Canadian Transsexuals (A.C.T.) in Toronto. Raj continued his activism by starting a petition to get Ontario to cover sex-reassignment surgery through the provincial health insurance plan, OHIP‚Äîan effort that was unsuccessful at the time. In May 1977, Raj moved with his partner (a trans woman who was to become his wife in the late 1980s) and his two children to Calgary, Alberta, because they had learned that surgeons at the Foothills Hospital, in affiliation with the University of Calgary's gender clinic were performing phalloplasties for female-to-male (FTM) transsexuals. While they were both approved for phalloplasty, neither of them had the surgery at that time; at only 100 pounds, the surgeons concluded that Raj did not have enough tissue to work with. Raj did, however, undergo the panhysterectomy at this time. After waiting for another 34 years, he finally underwent \\"bottom surgery\\" (not phalloplasty, but metoidioplasty) in Montreal, Quebec in 2012 at age 60.Elspeth Brown oral history with Rupert Raj, 23 December 2013, CLGA; Elspeth Brown personal communication with Raj, 3 December 2014. Foundation for the Advancement of Canadian Transsexuals and Gender Review In January 1978, Raj started an organization for trans people (including trans men and women, as well as cross-dressers), the Foundation for the Advancement of Canadian Transsexuals (FACT); the organization's newsletter was Gender Review: A FACTual Journal.‚ÄúFoundation History,‚Äù Gender Review: A FACTual Journal no. 1 (June 1978), 1. FACT continued some of the earlier work of the ACT. The first issue of Gender Review was published in June 1978 and included a story on ‚ÄúTranssexual Oppression‚Äù concerning Montrealer Inge Stephens; information about transsexual resources; a listing of publications by Dr. Harry Benjamin and Dr. Charles L. Ihlenfeld; a bibliography of books and articles by and about trans people; and news items about Mario Martino, trans woman Canary Conn's appearance on the Phil Donahue show, and other notices.Gender Review: A FACTual Journal no. 1 (June 1978), 1-12; see also Nicholas Matte, ‚ÄúRupert Raj and the Rise of Transsexual Consumer Activism in the 1980s,‚Äù in Dan Irving and Rupert Raj, eds., Trans Activism in Canada: A Reader (Toronto: Scholars' Press, 2014), 35. Raj moved back to Ottawa and then to Toronto in the following years, but continued to edit the journal until February 1982.‚ÄúFACT HG Moves to Toronto,‚Äù Gender Review: A FACTual Journal no. 5 (July 1979), 1. In December 1981 Raj decided to focus on the unique, specific needs of trans men. At the time, there were very few trans advocacy groups for trans men in particular.Jamison Green, Becoming A Visible Man (Nashville, TN: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004), 55; Raj's work, based in Toronto, Canada, joined that of Mario and Becky Martino's Labyrinth Foundation's Counseling Services (Yonkers, NY); Johnny A's F2M (Tenafly, NJ; Jude Patton's Renaissance group in Santa Ana, CA; and Jeff S.‚Äôs group in Southern California. Raj resigned from his role at both FACT and Gender Review, and both were taken over by Susan Huxford, a trans woman from Hamilton, ON with whom Raj had begun working in late 1979.‚ÄúFACTual Notes,‚Äù no. 8 Gender Review: A FACTual Journal no. 5 (April 1980), 1; ‚ÄúPersonal Profiles: Susan G. Huxford,‚Äù no. 8 Gender Review: A FACTual Journal no. 5 (April 1980), 5. Metamorphosis Medical Research Foundation and Metamorphosis Magazine Raj had planned to partner with Mario Martino (aka Angelo Tornabene) in Yonkers, NY to research, develop, and market a penile prosthetic device as an alternative to phalloplasty. It was for this reason that Raj named the new organization the Metamorphosis Medical Research Foundation (MMRF). At the same time, however, Raj wanted to provide support for other trans men, and serve as an information broker between the medical/psychological community and trans men and their loved ones.Elspeth Brown oral history interview with Rupert Raj, 14 March 2014; Nick Matte, ‚ÄúRupert Raj and the Rise of Transsexual Consumer Activism in the 1980s,‚Äù in Dan Irving and Rupert Raj, eds., Trans Activism in Canada: A Reader (Toronto: Scholars' Press, 2014), 38. For the importance of Raj‚Äôs work to other trans people in the 1970s and 1980s in the era before the internet, see J. Ari Kane- Demaios and Vern L. Bullough, Crossing Sexual Boundaries: Transgender Journeys, Uncharted Paths (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 2006), 96 and Bonnie Bullough, Gender Blending (Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1997), 467. Beginning in 1979 and through the MMRF years, Raj was also an active correspondent with Lou Sullivan, and Raj‚Äôs friendship and activism played an important role in Sullivan‚Äôs later work in founding the San Francisco-based support and education group ‚ÄúFTM‚Äù in 1986.Brice D. Smith, ‚Äú‚ÄôYours in Liberation‚Äô: Lou Sullivan and the Construction of FTM Identity,‚Äù PhD dissertation, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 2010, pp. 248-257; Susan Stryker, ‚ÄúPortrait of a Transfag Drag Hag as a Young Man: The Activist Career of Louis G. Sullivan,‚Äù in Kate Moore and Stephen Whittle, eds., Reclaiming Genders: Transsexual Grammars at the Fin de Siecle (London: Cassell, 1999), 62‚Äì82. Consequently, Raj founded the bi-monthly magazine Metamorphosis (February 1982 February 1988). The magazine promised information on various aspects of (female transsexualism) written by Raj and others, clinical research, hormones, surgery, tips to effectively passing as male in public, and legal reform for trans people.Metamorphosis vol. 1, no 1 (February 1982), 1. Metamorphosis became the most important international magazine for FTMs in the 1980s. Most of its subscribers were American, but there were also trans men from Canada, Great Britain, Europe, Australia and New Zealand who eagerly paid to get the sought-after news, information and resources.Nick Matte, ‚ÄúRupert Raj and the Rise of Transsexual Consumer Activism in the 1980s‚Äù Trans Activism in Canada: A Reader (Toronto: Scholars‚Äô Press, 2014), 36-37.

Rankin (Editors). We Still Demand! Redefining Resistance in Sex and Gender Struggles. UBC Press, 2017, 117-136. In 1988, Raj decided to close MMRF and end publication of Metamorphosisdue to cumulative burnout. Gender Worker and Gender NetWorker Raj formed a new organization in June 1988, Gender Worker (later named \\"Gender Consultants\\" when his then wife joined his entrepreneurial enterprise as a co-consultant), and published a new newsletter Gender NetWorker specifically designed for ‚Äúhelping professionals and resource providers‚Äù who worked with transsexuals and transvestites (aka cross dressers) (1988, two issues).Gender NetWorker vol. 1 no. 1 (June, 1988). Between 1990 and 1999, Raj was not publicly active as a trans activist, opting to mainstream into cisgender, straight society for those nine years in hopes of healing from massive burnout. Raj re-emerged in 1999 to begin a support group in Toronto called the Trans-Men/FTM Peer-Support Group.Elspeth Brown oral history interview with Rupert Raj, 14 March 2014, CLGA. Since then, Raj has been active in Toronto as a psychotherapist, gender specialist, and trans-positive professional trainer. RR Consulting and Beyond In April 2002, Raj founded ‚ÄúRR Consulting,‚Äù a part-time, home-based, private psychotherapy and consulting practice serving trans, genderqueer, intersex and two-spirit adults and their loved ones, and also gender- independent kids and their parents. He also assessed trans people for readiness for either cross-sex hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery. Additionally, he provided trans-focussed training workshops on the medical, psychological, social, vocational, legal and spiritual/existential aspects of gender identity and gender transitioning for hospitals, health centres, universities, colleges and corporate workplaces. In November 2002, Raj started working as a mental health counselor at Sherbourne Health Centre (SHC) in Toronto, providing individual, couple and family therapy for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender, gender-questioning and sexually- questioning clients and their loved ones, and also co-facilitated SHC's ‚ÄúGender Journeys‚Äù (a psychoeducational group for people considering transitioning to their identified gender) from 2006 to 2013. He retired from Sherbourne in 2015. Beyond his clinical work, Raj is still active in the trans, genderqueer, intersex and two-spirit communities in Toronto, participating in numerous community advisory committees for local community agencies, spearheading the first annual Trans Pride Day at SHC in 2004 (which was later renamed to include intersex and two-spirit people), delivering public speeches at the 2011 Honoured Dyke Group event of Pride Toronto (honouring the Trans Lobby Group, of which Raj was the sole trans male member), the 2012 Toronto Trans March, and the 2014 Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) held at Toronto City Hall, proclaiming it as an official day in Toronto along with the raising of the first Ontario trans flag. Education and Professional Affiliations In 2001, Raj graduated from The Adler School of Professional Psychology (main campus based in Chicago) with a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology. Raj is a member of the Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health (CPATH) (2007 ‚Äì present), and in 2015 became a Canadian Certified Counsellor (CCC) and joined applied to the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario (CRPO). Publications and Presentations To date, Raj has published four trans-focused clinical research papers.Rupert Raj, ‚ÄúTowards a transpositive therapeutic model: Developing clinical sensitivity and cultural competence in the effective support of transsexual and transgendered clients.‚Äù International Journal of Transgenderism, 2002, Vol. 6, No. 2; S.Gapka and Rupert Raj, (2003).

Since 1999, Raj has designed and delivered more than 20 distinct trans-focused training workshops and presentations in Canada, the US and the UK. In April 2006, he taught an accredited elective course for The Adler School of Professional Psychology (Ontario campus) in Toronto, employing his \\"TransPositive Therapeutic Model\\" (2002), supporting transsexual/transgender adults. Building on this basic model, Raj's \\"TransFormative Therapeutic Model\\" (2008) supported therapists working with couples and families with trans members, as well as gender non-conforming youth and their parents. In 2017, Raj made available the text of his international trans poetry anthology ‚ÄúOf Souls & Roles, Of Sex & Gender: A Treasury of Transsexual, Transgenderist & Transvestic Verse from 1967 to 1991.\\" The volume includes nearly 400 poems penned by 169 trans people throughout Canada, the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.Raj, Rupert (Editor).

It was the first of a very successful series of films based on works by Edgar Wallace produced by Rialto Film in West Germany. This film was adapted from the 1925 novel The Fellowship of the Frog. Plot Cast Production The film is adapted from Edgar Wallace's novel The Fellowship of the Frog (1925). Previous versions were made in 1928 in the US (as a serial) and in 1937 in the UK, both titled The Mark of the Frog. The project was deemed risky, as so far no German crime film had really succeeded at the box office after World War II. The initiative to try came from , head of Constantin Film who approached his friend Preben Philipsen with the idea. Philipsen acquired the rights for the movie adaption of The Fellowship of the Frog and The Crimson Circle from Penelope Wallace, with an option on other novels by her father should the films be successful. Barthel decided on Reinl as director and fixed production cost at a maximum of 600,000 Deutsche Mark. As scriptwriter the producer hired Egon Eis who had worked on the 1931 adaption of The Squeaker. Eis' script for the Frog, delivered in January 1959 under the nom de plume \\"Trygve Larsen\\", stuck closely to the novel. Jochen Joachim Bartsch, a friend of Reinl, also worked on the script. The \\"comic relief\\" character, played by Arent, was added by the script writers, he does not exist in the novel. Some characters were much reduced in significance (Broad and Maitland), some were dropped altogether (Maitland's sister). Another change was making Fuchsberger's character the nephew of Sir Archibald, the head of Scotland Yard. In addition, the name for Brockmann's character was changed: in Wallace's novel he was called \\"Harry Lime\\" (or Lyme). Since this had been the name of Orson Welles' character in Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), the producers decided to change it. Cinematography took place from 24 April to 9 June 1959. The studio for interiors was Palladium Atelier at Kopenhagen. Exteriors were also shot in and around Kopenhagen. A small team, including Reinl and his director of cinematography Kalinke travelled to London for two days to shoot some stock footage to be used in back projection. Release The FSK gave the film a rating of 16 years and up, unsuitable for screening on public holidays. Four scenes had to be cut to receive even this rating and avoid an \\"adults only\\" one. The film premiered on 4 September 1959 at the Universum in Stuttgart. With an audience of 3 million in Germany the film was an extraordinary success. The film's box office success ultimately spawned the series of films by Rialto of 32 films that ran through 1972. The series heavily influenced the style and content of German crime and mystery films throughout the 1960s, as well as giving rise to outright copycat films made by other studios such as Artur Brauner's CCC Film. Home Media The film made its DVD debut on 29 January 2008 by Infinity Entertainment Group as a part of The Edgar Wallace Collection which included several other adaptions of the works of writer Edgar Wallace.

In the relaunched Valiant Universe, Livewire first appears in Harbinger's first arc. Livewire has been featured in Unity as a founding member since 2013. Fictional character biography (Valiant Entertainment) =Harbinger Foundation= A psionic teletechnopath, able to control machines with force of will alone, Amanda McKee was orphaned at a young age, and sent to live in a group home. It was there that billionaire visionary and founder of the Harbinger Foundation, Toyo Harada, discovered her and took her into his care, rescuing her from the abusive environments of her early life. For this Amanda became unfailingly devoted to Harada and his mission. Assuming the name Livewire, Amanda became a star pupil of the Harbinger Foundation, eventually becoming one of Harada's most trusted aides. All that changed, however, when Peter Stanchek joined the Harbinger Foundation. Faced with a power that nearly equaled his own, Harada's facade of control began to fray and his domineering tendencies became clearer and clearer to Livewire. Still faithful to Harada's vision, but believing that Peter could help balance his immense power, Livewire aided Harada's wayward student in his escape from the Harbinger Foundation and sent herself into exile following her betrayal. =Unity= Months later, when Aric of Dacia returned from space as the leader of a freed legion of Vine slaves and claimed Romania as the homeland of his new people, Harada reactivated Livewire and asked her to join his elite strike team, Unity. Utilizing her power to control machines, Livewire was able to strip the X-O Manowar armor from Aric and don it herself - with the intent of handing it over to Harada in turn. With the most powerful weapon in the universe at her command, Livewire easily subdued Aric's people and quickly defused a nuclear strike by rival nations bent on annihilating X-O Manowar. Bonding with the armor, however, unlocked the full potential of Livewire's abilities, giving her full access to the records of the Harbinger Foundation. With all of Harada's darkest secrets now exposed to her, Livewire at last realized the true extent of his evil and quickly marshaled the Unity team against her former mentor. Now fully expelled from the Harbinger empire, Livewire joined Ninjak in the service of England's MI-6, and traveled to Taiwan to investigate strange happenings related to the mysterious Dr. Silk... Fictional character biography (Valiant Comics) The original incarnation of Amanda McKee is a Harbinger training at the Harbinger Foundation with her boyfriend, Edward T. Sedgewick. After abandoning the foundation, the two are forced to live on the run in hiding from Toyo Harada. This causes immense strain on their relationship, causing them to separate but remain close friends. Geomancer Geoff McHenry eventually recruits Amanda and Edward to join his Secret Warriors. Their time on the team is short lived, as they are deemed to volatile to be among the public, and are surrendered back into the Harbinger Foundation. Once again under control of the foundation, Amanda undergoes a lobotomy that alters her being, turning her into a devout warrior that joins Toyo Harada and helps him fulfill his dream of a new world order. The operation also causes Amanda to lose her memory of her relationship with Edward.

Early life and education Saleem Takla was born in Kfarshima, Lebanon in 1849‚ÄúÿßŸÑÿ≥Ÿäÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ∞ÿßÿ™Ÿäÿ© ŸÑŸÑÿ£ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿ∞ / ÿ≥ŸÑŸäŸÖ ÿ™ŸÇŸÑÿß,‚Äù Al-Ahram, http://www.alahram.org.eg/ahram_board_sleem.htm. to Khalil and Nada Takla.ÿ≠ŸÖÿ≤ÿ© ÿπŸÑŸäÿßŸÜ, ‚Äúÿ¢ŸÑ ÿ™ŸÇŸÑÿß Ÿà¬´ÿßŸÑÿ£Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÖ¬ª,‚Äù Al-Qabas, January 23, 2010. http://www.alqabas.com.kw/node/600144. The Takla family was Melkite Greek Catholic. When he was 12, he was sent to school in Beirut, first to a grade school organized by Cornelius Van Alen Van Dyck and then to the National School in Abey founded by Butrus al-Bustani. During that time, the 1860 Druze‚ÄìMaronite conflict dramatically impacted the region. After completing his studies, Takla taught at the Patriarchal College in Beirut founded by Gregory II Youssef.  Moving to Alexandria and Founding Al-Ahram  In 1874 Takla moved to Alexandria, Egypt. During this period, Alexandria was ‚Äúboth a bridgehead of European colonialism and a crucible of Egyptian national integration and identity.‚ÄùMichael J. Reimer, Colonial Bridgehead: Government and Society in Alexandria, 1807‚Äì1882. (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1997). More people were becoming literate, thanks in part to the development of new schools in the city, and conflicts and crises throughout the Middle East piqued public interest in world events. Furthermore, Alexandria was becoming a center of the news and publishing businesses, with many European news services, printing presses, and publishers setting up shop in the city. A large population of translators in the city, many of them Syro-Lebanese (like Takla), further aided the newspaper business by allowing Arabic newspapers to better report on international events using sources in other languages. Finally, Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt from 1863‚Äì1879, and his successors patronized several Alexandria newspapers, which certainly aided the development of the industry. As Syro-Lebanese immigrants, the Takla brothers benefited from belonging to a community recognized for ‚Äútheir knowledge of languages,‚Äù familiarity ‚Äúwith the practice of Arabic journalism,‚Äù and ‚Äúclose connections with Egypt's political and commercial √©lite.‚Äù In the newspaper business, ‚Äúoffering news of events in Syria and in the Syrian community‚Äù gave new papers access to a niche market, specifically the Syrian community in Alexandria. Despite all of these advantages, the Takla brothers ‚Äúmoved cautiously.‚Äù They ‚Äúspent seven months attempting to find subscribers, and even printed up a facsimile copy for promotional purposes, before actually going to press.‚ÄùJuan R. I. Cole, Colonialism and Revolution In the Middle East: Social and Cultural Origins of Egypt's 'Urabi Movement (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1992). Finally, in 1876, the Takla brothers began publishing al-Ahram (meaning the Pyramids), ‚Äúfor a long time the most prestigious daily in the Arab world‚Äù. The next year, in 1877, they began publishing Sada al- Ahram (meaning Echo of the Pyramids), followed by al-Waqt (meaning the Time) in 1879 and al-Ahwal (the Conditions) in 1882.  Political Action and Censorship  As described above, Alexandria in the 1860s and 1870s offered many benefits to newspapers, including the patronage of Isma'il Pasha. However, that support came with the expectation that newspapers would support the government. This policy was enforced not only through government patronage, but also by law. According to Juan Cole: ‚ÄúIn October 1863 the Egyptian foreign minister made it known that Ottoman censorship laws would henceforth be more strictly applied in Egypt, through a special government department overseeing newspapers. Newspapers were to abstain absolutely from any criticism of governmental actions and avoid any discussion of matters, the mention of which might affect relations with foreign powers. Reporters had to report news from the provinces in a manner that kept to the facts, avoiding any criticism of officials. Editors were responsible for orally reporting the content of articles to the Press Bureau before going to press. Newspapers contravening these articles of the law would receive three warnings, after which they would be closed down and large fines would be imposed.‚Äù These declarations aside, the environment of Alexandria moderated the force of censorship laws. The large foreign presence in Alexandria, including Syro- Lebanese like the Takla brothers, helped limit enforcement of the laws, since many foreigners enjoyed some form of protected status in Egypt, a system that began with the Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire. The educational system further provoked resistance to censorship by developing and enlarging the intellectual class. Furthermore, by allowing newspapers more license, Isma'il Pasha hoped ‚Äúto use the press to fight off the increasing influence of Britain and France over Egyptian internal affairs‚Äù and therefore ‚Äúallowed a livelier Arabic political press to grow up that had some hope of surviving financially.‚Äù Eventually, the Takla brothers did run afoul of censorship laws. They first ‚Äúhad their Sada al-Ahram suspended and fined for finding fault with Isma'il, and on its second serious offense the Publications Department simply ordered it out of existence.‚Äù However, the Takla brothers had other newspapers, and this setback did not prevent them from continuing to attempt to exert political influence using their other outlets.

Description Platyrhacids are often large and colorful. They can be distinguished from most other polydesmidans by having ozopores situated further inward from the paranota margins, ozopores surrounded by a broad, flat ring, and presence of compound setae on the labrum and often on the epiproct (a posterior extension of the telson). The gonopods in males are relatively simple, although up to five gonopodal processes (\\"branches\\") may be present in some genera from Borneo. Large platyrhacids in Borneo may grow up to long and exhibit colors of blue, green, and yellow with black spots or stripes. Distribution Platyrhacids occur in two disjunct geographic areas. The majority of species occur in Southeast Asia, including the Greater Sunda Islands and the Philippine archipelago. The rest occur in the New World Tropics from Nicaragua to Peru, as well as on some Caribbean islands. Classification The Platyrhacidae is part of the larger suborder Chelodesmidea. The family Platyrhacidae is subdivided into several groups, formerly considered tribes but elevated to the status of subfamilies in 2013.

Shortly after, Orator F. Cook added Acanthodesmus, Odontodesmus, and Trachelodesmus. By 1897, additional works by Cook, Pocock, and Filippo Silvestri had increased the number of genera to 37. The North American genera Euryurus, Auturus, and Illiniurus, were long-considered to constitute a sub-group of Platyrhacidae (i.e. the subfamily Euryurinae or tribe Euryurini in various classifications), until separated as a distinct family (Euryuridae) by Hoffman in 1998 and allied closer to Xystodesmidae. Similarly and concurrently, several neotropical genera previously placed in other subgroups of Platyrhacidae were removed and elevated to full family status: the Aphelidesmidae.

The bill was introduced and passed during the 113th United States Congress and became federal law on September 26, 2014 when signed by President Barack Obama.https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1603 In 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed the law's constitutionality in Patchak v. Zinke.https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/patchak-v-jewell Background In 2009, the Supreme Court held in Carcieri v. Salazar that the term \\"now under Federal jurisdiction\\" referred only to tribes that were federally recognized when the Indian Reorganization ActWheeler-Howard Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 988 became law, and the federal government could not take land into trust from tribes that were recognized after 1934.Donald L. Carcieri, et al. v. Ken L. Salazar, et al., This act clarified that the Match-E-Be-Nash- She-Wish Band's land trust could not be challenged in court under the Carcieri decision. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act ratifies and confirms the actions of the Secretary of the Interior in taking specified land into trust for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians. The act reaffirms that land as trust land. The act prohibits an action relating to that land from being filed or maintained in a federal court. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on May 21, 2014. This is a public domain source. S. 1603 reaffirms the status of lands taken into trust by the Department of the Interior (DOI) for the benefit of the Match-E-Be-Nash-She- Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians in the state of Michigan. The legislation also prohibits any lawsuits related to the trust land. In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that DOI lacked the authority to take nearly 150 acres into trust. Based on information provided by DOI, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the legislation would have no significant effect on the federal budget. The legislation would not significantly increase the cost of managing tribal trust lands. The act would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. The act contains an intergovernmental and private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) because it ends rights of action for public and private entities that are currently able to pursue legal actions related to the land held in trust for the Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians. The act prohibits any action relating to the trust land from being brought or maintained in a federal court. The cost of the mandate would be any forgone compensation that would have been awarded through legal actions. The state of Michigan and several local governments have entered into an agreement with the tribe related to the use of the land, and CBO believes it is unlikely that, without the act, any other public entity would bring an action that would result in significant compensation. Therefore, CBO estimated the cost of the intergovernmental mandate would not exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for such mandates ($76 million, in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Private entities, however, have no such agreement, and the bill would extinguish all rights to legal actions relating to the trust lands. Awards in such claims are in many cases limited to the value of the land. Because of the commercial properties located on the trust land, the value of awards related to those lands could be significant. However, because both the number of claims that could be barred or terminated and the value of forgone compensation stemming from those claims were uncertain, CBO had no basis for estimating the cost of the mandate. Therefore, CBO could not determine whether the cost of the private-sector mandate would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for such mandates ($152 million, in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Gun Lake Trust Land Reaffirmation Act was introduced into the United States Senate on October 29, 2013 by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D, MI). The bill was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. The committee held a hearing about the bill on May 7, 2014. On June 19, 2014, the Senate voted to pass the bill with unanimous consent. On September 16, 2014, the House of Representatives voted 359-64 to pass the bill.

Bonney's occupation was as a grazier but his hobby was photography and anthropology. He took many pictures of the Paakantyi people who had traditionally lived along the Paroo River. These people had been devastated by disease and the invasion by foreign immigrants. Bonney's attitude to these people was not as judgmental as many and he took natural pictures which recorded their lives. He was shocked by the racist views of others and he recorded his respect for the \\"loyalty and integrity\\" of the native Australians.

Euler rotations and Tait‚ÄìBryan rotations are particular cases of the Davenport general rotation decomposition. The angles of rotation are called Davenport angles because the general problem of decomposing a rotation in a sequence of three was studied first by Paul B. Davenport.P. B. Davenport, Rotations about nonorthogonal axes The non-orthogonal rotating coordinate system may be imagined to be rigidly attached to a rigid body. In this case, it is sometimes called a local coordinate system. Being rotation axes are solidary with the moving body, the generalized rotations can be divided into two groups (here x, y and z refer to the non-orthogonal moving frame): ; Generalized Euler rotations: ; Generalized Tait‚ÄìBryan rotations: . Most of the cases belong to the second group, being the generalized Euler rotations are a degenerated case in which first and third axes are overlapping.  Davenport rotation theorem  Davenport possible axes for steps 1 and 3 given Z as the step 2 The general problem of decomposing a rotation into three composed movements about intrinsic axes was studied by P. Davenport, under the name \\"generalized Euler angles\\", but later these angles were named \\"Davenport angles\\" by M. Shuster and L. Markley.M. Shuster and L. Markley, Generalization of Euler angles, Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, Vol. 51, No. 2, April‚ÄìJune 2003, pp. 123‚Äì123 The general problem consists of obtaining the matrix decomposition of a rotation given the three known axes. In some cases one of the axes is repeated. This problem is equivalent to a decomposition problem of matrices.J. Wittenburg, L. Lilov, Decomposition of a finite rotation in three rotations about given axes Davenport proved that any orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations using non-orthogonal axes. The elemental rotations can either occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system (extrinsic rotations) or about the axes of a rotating coordinate system, which is initially aligned with the fixed one and modifies its orientation after each elemental rotation (intrinsic rotations). According to the Davenport theorem, a unique decomposition is possible if and only if the second axis is perpendicular to the other two axes. Therefore, axes 1 and 3 must be in the plane orthogonal to axis 2.M. Shuster and L. Markley, Generalization of Euler angles, Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, Vol. 51, No. 2, April‚ÄìJune 2003, pp. 123‚Äì123 Therefore, decompositions in Euler chained rotations and Tait‚ÄìBryan chained rotations are particular cases of this. The Tait‚ÄìBryan case appears when axes 1 and 3 are perpendicular, and the Euler case appears when they are overlapping.  Complete system of rotations  Image 2: Airplane resting on a plane A set of Davenport rotations is said to be complete if it is enough to generate any rotation of the space by composition. Speaking in matrix terms, it is complete if it can generate any orthonormal matrix of the space, whose determinant is +1. Due to the non-commutativity of the matrix product, the rotation system must be ordered. Sometimes the order is imposed by the geometry of the underlying problem. For example, when used for vehicles, which have a special axis pointing to the \\"forward\\" direction, only one of the six possible combinations of rotations is useful. The interesting composition is the one able to control the heading and the elevation of the aircraft with one independent rotation each. In the adjacent drawing, the yaw, pitch and roll (YPR) composition allows adjustment of the direction of an aircraft with the two first angles. A different composition like YRP would allow establishing the direction of the wings axis, which is obviously not useful in most cases. Tait‚ÄìBryan chained rotations principal axes of an aircraft Tait‚ÄìBryan rotations are a special case in which the first and third axes are perpendicular among them. Assuming a reference frame with a convention as in image 2, and a plane with axes like in the image 1, lying horizontal on the plane in the beginning, after performing intrinsic rotations Y, P and R in the yaw, pitch and roll axes (in this order) we obtain something similar to image 3. Image 3: Heading, elevation and bank angles after yaw, pitch and roll rotations (Z-Y‚Äô-X‚Äô‚Äô) In the beginning : * the plane roll axis is on axis x of the reference frame * the plane pitch axis is on axis y of the reference frame * the plane yaw axis is on axis z of the reference frame The rotations are applied in order yaw, pitch and roll. In these conditions, the Heading (angle on the horizontal plane) will be equal to the yaw applied, and the Elevation will be equal to the pitch. Matrix expressions for the three Tait‚ÄìBryan rotations in 3 dimensions are: :\\\\begin{align}  R_x(\\\\phi) = \\\\mathrm{Roll}(\\\\phi) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0  0 & \\\\cos\\\\phi & -\\\\sin\\\\phi  0 & \\\\sin\\\\phi & \\\\cos\\\\phi \\\\end{bmatrix}  R_y(\\\\theta) = \\\\mathrm{Pitch}(\\\\theta) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0 & \\\\sin\\\\theta  0 & 1 & 0  -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 & \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{bmatrix}  R_z(\\\\psi) = \\\\mathrm{Yaw}(\\\\psi) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\psi & -\\\\sin\\\\psi & 0  \\\\sin\\\\psi & \\\\cos\\\\psi & 0  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} The matrix of the composed rotations is :\\\\begin{align} M &= \\\\mathrm{Yaw}(\\\\psi) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{Pitch}(\\\\theta) \\\\, \\\\mathrm{Roll}(\\\\phi)  &= R_z(\\\\psi) R_y(\\\\theta) R_x(\\\\phi). \\\\end{align} Of the six possible combinations of yaw, pitch and roll, this combination is the only one in which the heading (direction of the roll axis) is equal to one of the rotations (the yaw), and the elevation (angle of the roll axis with the horizontal plane) is equal to other of the rotations (to the pitch). Euler chained rotations Starting position of an aircraft to apply proper Euler angles Euler rotations appear as the special case in which the first and third axes of rotations are overlapping. These Euler rotations are related to the proper Euler angles, which were thought to study the movement of a rigid body such as a planet. The angle to define the direction of the roll axis is normally named \\"longitude of the revolution axis\\" or \\"longitude of the line of nodes\\" instead of \\"heading\\", which makes no sense for a planet. Anyway, Euler rotations can still be used when speaking about a vehicle, though they will have a weird behavior. As the vertical axis is the origin for the angles, it is named \\"inclination\\" instead of \\"elevation\\". As before, describing the attitude of a vehicle, there is an axis considered pointing forward, and therefore only one out of the possible combinations of rotations will be useful. The combination depends on how the axis are taken and what the initial position of the plane is. Using the one in the drawing, and combining rotations in such a way that an axis is repeated, only roll‚Äìpitch‚Äìroll will allow controlling the longitude and the inclination with one rotation each. The three matrices to multiply are: :\\\\begin{align} R_z(\\\\phi) = \\\\mathrm{Roll}_1(\\\\phi) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\phi & -\\\\sin\\\\phi & 0  \\\\sin\\\\phi & \\\\cos\\\\phi & 0  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}  R_y(\\\\theta) = \\\\mathrm{Pitch}(\\\\theta) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\theta & 0 & \\\\sin\\\\theta  0 & 1 & 0  -\\\\sin\\\\theta & 0 & \\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\end{bmatrix}  R_z(\\\\psi) = \\\\mathrm{Roll}_2(\\\\psi) &= \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\cos\\\\psi & -\\\\sin\\\\psi & 0  \\\\sin\\\\psi & \\\\cos\\\\psi & 0  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} In this convention Roll1 imposes the \\"heading\\", Pitch is the \\"inclination\\" (complementary of the elevation), and Roll2 imposes the \\"tilt\\". Conversion to extrinsic rotations A rotation represented by Euler angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) = (‚àí60¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞), using z-x‚Äô-z‚Ä≥ intrinsic rotations The same rotation represented by (Œ≥, Œ≤, Œ±) = (45¬∞, 30¬∞, ‚àí60¬∞), using z-x-z extrinsic rotations Davenport rotations are usually studied as an intrinsic rotation composition, because of the importance of the axes fixed to a moving body, but they can be converted to an extrinsic rotation composition, in case it could be more intuitive. Any extrinsic rotation is equivalent to an intrinsic rotation by the same angles but with inverted order of elemental rotations, and vice versa. For instance, the intrinsic rotations x-y‚Äô-z‚Ä≥ by angles Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ are equivalent to the extrinsic rotations z-y-x by angles Œ≥, Œ≤, Œ±. Both are represented by a matrix :R = X(\\\\alpha) Y(\\\\beta) Z(\\\\gamma) if R is used to pre-multiply column vectors, and by a matrix :R = Z(\\\\gamma) Y(\\\\beta) X(\\\\alpha) if R is used to post- multiply row vectors. See Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices for more details.  Relationship with physical motions  =Intrinsic rotations= Intrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the rotating coordinate system XYZ, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation. The XYZ system rotates, while xyz is fixed. Starting with XYZ overlapping xyz, a composition of three intrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for XYZ. The Euler or Tait-Bryan angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows: * The XYZ system rotates by Œ± about the Z axis (which coincides with the z axis). The X axis now lies on the line of nodes. * The XYZ system rotates about the now rotated X axis by Œ≤. The Z axis is now in its final orientation, and the X axis remains on the line of nodes. * The XYZ system rotates a third time about the new Z axis by Œ≥. The above-mentioned notation allows us to summarize this as follows: the three elemental rotations of the XYZ-system occur about z, x‚Äô and z‚Ä≥. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted z-x‚Äô-z‚Ä≥. Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait-Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details). Sometimes, the same sequence is simply called z-x-z, Z-X-Z, or 3-1-3, but this notation may be ambiguous as it may be identical to that used for extrinsic rotations. In this case, it becomes necessary to separately specify whether the rotations are intrinsic or extrinsic. Rotation matrices can be used to represent a sequence of intrinsic rotations. For instance, :R = X(\\\\alpha) Y(\\\\beta) Z(\\\\gamma) represents a composition of intrinsic rotations about axes x-y‚Äô-z‚Ä≥, if used to pre-multiply column vectors, while :R = Z(\\\\gamma) Y(\\\\beta) X(\\\\alpha) represents exactly the same composition when used to post-multiply row vectors. See Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices for more details. =Extrinsic rotations= Extrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system xyz. The XYZ system rotates, while xyz is fixed. Starting with XYZ overlapping xyz, a composition of three extrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for XYZ. The Euler or Tait-Bryan angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows: * The XYZ system rotates about the z axis by Œ±. The X axis is now at angle Œ± with respect to the x axis. * The XYZ system rotates again about the x axis by Œ≤. The Z axis is now at angle Œ≤ with respect to the z axis. * The XYZ system rotates a third time about the z axis by Œ≥. In sum, the three elemental rotations occur about z, x and z. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted z-x-z (or 3-1-3). Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait‚ÄìBryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details). Rotation matrices can be used to represent a sequence of extrinsic rotations. For instance, :R = Z(\\\\gamma) Y(\\\\beta) X(\\\\alpha) represents a composition of extrinsic rotations about axes x-y-z, if used to pre-multiply column vectors, while :R = X(\\\\alpha) Y(\\\\beta) Z(\\\\gamma) represents exactly the same composition when used to post-multiply row vectors. See Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices for more details. =Conversion between intrinsic and extrinsic rotations= A rotation represented by Euler angles (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥) = (‚àí60¬∞, 30¬∞, 45¬∞), using z-x‚Äô-z‚Ä≥ intrinsic rotations The same rotation represented by (Œ≥, Œ≤, Œ±) = (45¬∞, 30¬∞, ‚àí60¬∞), using z-x-z extrinsic rotations Any extrinsic rotation is equivalent to an intrinsic rotation by the same angles but with inverted order of elemental rotations, and vice versa. For instance, the intrinsic rotations x-y‚Äô-z‚Ä≥ by angles Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ are equivalent to the extrinsic rotations z-y-x by angles Œ≥, Œ≤, Œ±. Both are represented by a matrix :R = X(\\\\alpha) Y(\\\\beta) Z(\\\\gamma) if R is used to pre-multiply column vectors, and by a matrix :R = Z(\\\\gamma) Y(\\\\beta) X(\\\\alpha) if R is used to post-multiply row vectors. See Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices for more details.  The proof of the conversion in the pre- multiply case  The rotation matrix of the intrinsic rotation sequence x-y‚Äô-z‚Ä≥ can be obtained by the sequential intrinsic element rotations from the right to the left: : R = ZY'X. In this process there are three frames related in the intrinsic rotation sequence. Let's denote the frame 0 as the initial frame, the frame 1 after the first rotation around the x axis, the frame 2 after the second rotation around the y‚Äô axis, and the frame 3 as the third rotation around z‚Ä≥ axis. Since a rotation matrix can be represented among these three frames, let's use the left shoulder index to denote the representation frame. The following notation means the rotation matrix that transforms the frame a to the frame b and that is represented in the frame c : : {}^c\\\\\\\\!R_{a \\\\rightarrow b}. An intrinsic element rotation matrix represented in that frame where the rotation happens has the same value as that of the corresponding extrinsic element rotation matrix: : {}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{1\\\\rightarrow0} = X, \\\\quad {}^1\\\\\\\\!R_{2\\\\rightarrow1} = Y, \\\\quad {}^2\\\\\\\\!R_{3\\\\rightarrow2} = Z. The intrinsic element rotation matrix Y‚Äô and Z‚Ä≥ represented in the frame 0 can be expressed as other forms: : \\\\begin{align} Y' &= {}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{2\\\\rightarrow1}  &= {}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{1\\\\rightarrow0}{}^1\\\\\\\\!R_{2\\\\rightarrow1}{}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{1\\\\rightarrow0}^{-1}  &= XYX^{-1}  Z &= {}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{3\\\\rightarrow2}  &= {}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{1\\\\rightarrow0}{}^1\\\\\\\\!R_{3\\\\rightarrow2}{}^0\\\\\\\\!R_{1\\\\rightarrow0}^{-1}  &= X\\\\left({}^1\\\\\\\\!R_{2\\\\rightarrow1}{}^2\\\\\\\\!R_{3\\\\rightarrow2}{}^1\\\\\\\\!R_{2\\\\rightarrow1}^{-1}\\\\right)X^{-1}  &= XYZY^{-1}X^{-1} \\\\end{align} The two equations above are substituted to the first equation: : \\\\begin{align} R &= ZY'X  &= \\\\left(XYZY^{-1}X^{-1}\\\\right)\\\\left(XYX^{-1}\\\\right)X  &= XYZY^{-1}\\\\left(X^{-1}X\\\\right)Y\\\\left(X^{-1}X\\\\right)  &= XYZ\\\\left(Y^{-1}Y\\\\right)  &= XYZ \\\\end{align} Therefore, the rotation matrix of an intrinsic element rotation sequence is the same as that of the inverse extrinsic element rotation sequence: : R = ZY'X = XYZ.

Life The elder son of Allen Maclean Skinner, Q.C., and a descendant of Matthew Skinner, was born in London in January 1839, and educated at London University, where he graduated LL.D. in 1861. In the same year he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, and went the northern circuit. A good linguist, he obtained a commission from the Daily News as special correspondent with the Danish Army in the Second Schleswig War. He was present during the campaign down to the Battle of Als at the end of June, when Christian IX of Denmark presented him with the Dannebrog order. He visited America, and then reported the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. In 1867 Skinner ran the blockade into Crete, then part of the Ottoman Empire. During the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, he was attached to the staff of the Crown Prince of Prussia's staff, and described the war from the battle of W√∂rth to the battle of Sedan. He carried his account of the decisive battle from Donchery, near Sedan, to London, riding neck and neck with William Howard Russell of The Times, and crossing from Ostend in the same boat. Their stories appeared simultaneously on 6 September, having been anticipated only in the Pall Mall Gazette. For a short time, in the spring of 1881, Skinner was assistant judicial commissioner in Cyprus. In 1885 he unsuccessfully contested the constituency of against Lord Randolph Churchill.

The festival presents Canadian artists with Asian origins. History Festival Acc√®s Asie was formed as the Montreal Asian Heritage Festival and founded on an Asian Heritage Month mandate which was established in the United States in 1976. This was further developed by the Toronto Asian Heritage Month Group in 1993. The Toronto Asian Heritage Month does not exist anymore. The national network of Asian Heritage Month groups and activities vary in mandate from arts presentations to forums, discussions to tributes of outstanding members from the Asian Canadian communities. The Montreal version of this mandate was revised to reflect the city's cultural climate. Festival Acc√®s Asie was created in 1995, and is the oldest Asian Heritage Month organization in Canada. The festival strives to create an environment for the promotion of art and culture of Canadian with Asian origin in Qu√©bec. Events are organized to highlight all artistic disciplines, including dance, comedy, theatre, video, film, visual arts, culinary art, music, poetry and new media. Artists come from over twenty countries: East Asia (Japan, China, Korea); Southeast Asia (Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore); South Asia (Pakistan, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka); Central & Middle Eastern Asia (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Afghanistan and Armenia). Under the leadership of General Manager and Artistic Director, Khosro Berahmandi, Festival Acc√®s Asie is a predominantly volunteer-based festival run by a small staff of employees and interns, a Board of Directors composed of artists and members of the Asian community, and an Honorary Advisory Committee. In addition to federal and provincial funding organizations, the festival benefits from the generous support of partners, collaborators and sponsors. Festival Acc√®s Asie is a bilingual organization offering events and activities in both official languages. Activities and mandate May is the Asian Heritage Month, and Festival Acc√®s Asie organizes a wide range of diverse cultural and artistic events.

He was the last of the Muhallabid governors of Ifriqiya, serving there from 793 until his death.  Career  Al-Fadl was the son of Rawh ibn Hatim al-Muhallabi, who was governor of Ifriqiya from 787 until 791. Following Rawh's death, Nasr ibn Habib al-Muhallabi became governor of the province, but al-Fadl, who was then in charge of the Zab region, wanted the position for himself. He therefore left Ifriqiya and made his way to the court of the caliph Harun al- Rashid, who he convinced to give him the appointment instead. Nasr was then dismissed and al-Muhallab ibn Yazid was made interim governor, until al-Fadl returned to the province in the spring of 791 and took up his new position. Al-Fadl's governorship quickly became troubled due to his poor relations with the garrison troops (jund), who he dealt with harshly as a result of their continued preference for Nasr. These tensions became particularly acute in Tunis, where al-Fadl's governor and nephew al-Mughirah ibn Bishr ibn Rawh was detested by the local jund. The latter eventually wrote to al-Fadl, asking that a new governor be appointed, but al-Fadl refused their request. In response, the jund took matters into their own hands, organizing themselves under 'Abdallah ibn al-Jarud and expelling al-Mughirah from the city. Following al-Mughirah's expulsion, Ibn al-Jarud initially attempted to reach an accord with al-Fadl, writing him to insist that no disloyalty against him was meant and asking that a suitable replacement be sent. Al-Fadl responded by appointing his cousin 'Abdallah ibn Yazid ibn Hatim over Tunis and sent him to take command of the city. When 'Abdallah ibn Yazid drew near to Tunis, however, he was met by a group sent by Ibn al-Jarud to speak to him; defying Ibn al-Jarud's orders, they attacked 'Abdallah ibn Yazid and killed him. Now believing that reconciliation with al-Fadl was impossible, Ibn al-Jarud instead decided to rebel against him. He wrote to the commanders of each city in Ifriqiya, reminding them of how al-Fadl had abused them and urging them to join his cause. With much of the jund flocking to Ibn al-Jarud's side, al-Fadl was forced to march against the rebels. In the resulting battle, al-Fadl was defeated and he retreated back to al-Qayrawan; Ibn al-Jarud's army, however, pursued him and besieged the city for a short time. Eventually the inhabitants of al-Qayrawan agreed to open their doors to the rebels, allowing Ibn al-Jarud and his army to enter it in September 794. Following the conquest, al-Fadl and his followers departed from the city and headed to Qabis, but Ibn al-Jarud decided to not allow this and instead had al-Fadl killed.

It consists of one large rock balanced on top of another large rock. An earlier incarnation of the work was a similar sculpture on the plateau of Valdresflya which was one of the artworks installed on each of Norway's eighteen scenic highways. Inspiration The motto of Fischli and Weiss is \\"Am sch√∂nsten ist das Gleichgewicht, kurz bevor's zusammenbricht\\" ‚Äî balance is most beautiful just at the point when it is about to collapse. Fischli spoke about the work at its unveiling in March 2013: > In Norway and here, to put one rock on top of another rock in the wilderness > is the first thing you do if you want to make a mark. When you walk and you > want to find your way back...you make this mark. It is a very archaic, > simple thing, but it is referencing the Venturi duck. We wanted to make > something that forces you to stop your car and get out to take a photograph. left Construction The first incarnation of the work was constructed for the Norwegian Public Roads Administration which commissioned artworks for its 18 tourist routes. The artists used a picture of a toy Playmobil crane lifting a large rock to illustrate their proposal, which was to place one large rock on top of another. This would be in the style of a wayfarer's cairn ‚Äî a marker to show that someone had passed this way ‚Äî but on a grand, monumental scale. In that case, the lower rock was already in place, and a real crane was used to place another rock on top of it. The two granite boulders used for the Serpentine work were natural rocks deposited by glacial action in North Wales. They weighed almost 30 tons each so their exact shape was mapped using lidar and then 3D models were constructed to determine a position in which they would balance without aid. This work was led by Alice Blair of the Arup engineering consultancy. The installation in London is temporary, as it was planned to be moved to its permanent site in Doha after a year. The exhibition in London was extended until September 2014 and complemented the new Serpentine Pavilion of Smiljan Radic, which also features large boulders. Reception Radic' summer pavilion. Rock on Top of Another Rock is off the picture to the left. Radic liked the work and commented, \\"A Fischli and Weiss rock is different from a Smiljan Radic rock. We are thinking about the same objects in a different way. How we put it in a space is really different. [Although] in the end, it's a rock\\". Director Hans-Ulrich Obrist has been enthusiastic about Fischli and Weiss' work since seeing their photographic exhibition, Equilibres/Quiet Afternoon, which was created in 1984 and is still on display at the gallery. He sees their new work as a meeting point, \\"We can meet each other beneath the rocks and talk about a rock on top of another rock.\\" Author John Costella praised the \\"sheer dynamics of its size and balance.

W. Hornung. He started writing the book while working as a tutor for Charles Joseph Parsons in Mossgiel Station, New South Wales, Australia. The novel was initially published by Smith, Elder & Co. as a serial in the Cornhill Magazine, and then published in book format by the same company in October 1890. As with Tiny Luttrell and The Unbidden Guest, two of Hornung's other early novels, A Bride from the Bush points out flaws in British society by presenting the country through an Australian perspective. A reviewer from The New York Times called the novel \\"a most piquant contrast between civilization and crudity\\". The writer Thomas Alexander Browne called the titular character of A Bride from the Bush \\"a libel to Australian womankind\\". A Punch editor made the opposite claim, arguing that the protagonist of the novel is more kind-hearted and attractive than actual Australians. Hornung's later stories in the A. J. Raffles series achieved much more popularity than A Bride from the Bush. Nonetheless, he himself liked A Bride from the Bush and his other Australian stories better than those of Raffles. When he published the novel Peccavi in 1900, a critic from The Advertiser wrote a scathing review, writing that Hornung should go back to Australia so he would be inspired to write something as good as A Bride from the Bush again. Upon Hornung's death, a tribute in The Freeman's Journal called A Bride from the Bush \\"the best and the best known\\" of Hornung's Australia-related stories. In 1924 Andr√© C≈ìuroy and Theodore Baker argued in The Musical Quarterly that Hornung's characterisation of the novel's hero as being pitiable for being unable to appreciate anthems demonstrates that A Bride from the Bush is typical of other novels of the time in favouring vocal church music.

In 1848 the station was superseded by Hull Paragon station after which it was primarily used for goods traffic. As a goods station the facility was known as Railway Street Goods station. Most of the buildings were demolished in 1959 as part of a modernisation programme converting the English Street Goods station into a main regional depot. Sidings remained on the site until the 1980s when housing development occupied the western part of the site. The site of the station buildings site was developed as a multi-storey housing development Freedom Quays in the 2000s. History =Manor House Street station (1840‚Äì1854)= The station was constructed as the original Hull terminus of the Hull and Selby Railway. The station was located on a site of around adjacent to the Humber Dock and Kingston Street. The main building was a two-storey structure of white brick and stone, known as Railway Office, was constructed facing onto Humber Dock. The office was deep by wide with waiting rooms, and ticket and parcel offices on the ground floor; a passage led from the station front to the train shed behind; the first floor contained the company offices including the director's room. The design is thought to be by James Walker and John Timperley, with Simminson & Hutchinson as the building contractors, ironwork by James Young. The main train shed was long by wide, connected at the east end to the offices, with trains arriving at the west end. There were four lines of track, and raised platforms at either side; the trainshed roof was supported on cast iron columns. An exit in the north wall led to a station road, which separated the passenger station from the goods shed to the north. The railways workshops of around were located west of the station, also facing Kingston Street, and included facilities for engine, wagon and carriage work, with power supplied by a 10 hp stationary engine. Hull and Selby railway, Hull workshops The goods shed and warehouse was a two-storey building long by wide, with a single line of track within, and two on either side, all running the entire length. Within the building the floor was above the level the track for ease of loading. The second floor had access to the lower throughout the shed, allowing movement from train to warehouse under cover. In addition to the goods warehouse the company had a wharf nearby at Limekiln Creek. Hull and Selby railway, Limekiln Creek warehouse On the opening day (1 July 1840) after a return trip from Hull to Selby a banquet with speeches was held in the upper warehouse. Public services started on 2 July, and goods service on 19 August. Initially passenger trains pulled into the station by a rope and capstan ‚Äì this led to an accident where the uncontrolled momentum imparted led to the train crashing through the booking office wall. Later the train would have the engine detached, run round and used to shunt the train backwards into the trainshed. The railway followed the practice used on early British railways of stopping the train outside the station for ticket inspections. In 1847 an act of Parliament allowed the construction of a new station, this opened in May 1848 as Hull Paragon station, and the station at Kingston Street closed to passengers. From June 1853 a suburban service of passenger trains running on the Victoria Dock Branch Line began terminating at the Station, running to and from Victoria Dock. The service was ended in 1854. =Railway Street goods station (1854‚Äì1961)= Railway Street goods interior (1905) After the opening of Paragon station the old station was used as a goods station. Expansion was soon required and land including the old Gaol (west of Manor House Street) and houses on Bell Vue Terrace were acquired and demolished and the station expanded.Ordnance Survey. Town plans, 1:1056, 1855‚Äì6; 1:2500, 1891‚Äì3 In 1858 the existing buildings were demolished and the site redeveloped in one piece as a goods station. The new goods station was designed by NER architect Thomas Prosser; the main building was long, initially with four platforms. The station was expanded in the mid 1860s increasing the number of platforms to right. A second shed was added to the west adjoining Railway Street. Built for the NER, the warehouse also provide service to other railways with running powers to Hull; the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London and North Western Railway; the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway used a wharfe and warehouse at Limekiln creek for lighter services across the Humber, replaced with a new warehouse and water channel at Railway Creek, built as replacement for the loss of the former during the construction of the new West Dock.See Hull and Selby Railway, Railway Creek, Limekiln creek, and Albert Dock. In 1959 a modernisation plan envisaged converting the English Street Goods station into one of the seven main depots in BR's North-eastern region, to be known as Hull Central goods depot. The Railway Street station was demolished in 1961. The Railway Street site remained in use as part of the Central Good's operations (opened October 1960) handling wagonload traffic and used for storage. Some sidings remained on the site until 1984, when housing was built on the entrance tracks. Much of the station site was redeveloped as Freedom Quays, a housing and multi-storey car park development between 2003‚Äì8; the northern part is used as a Ship chandler; Hull Marina's boat yard is also located on the site.

All of the 52 people on board were killed. Accident The C-124 departed McChord Air Base in Washington state en route to Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage, Alaska, with a crew of 11 and 41 Army and Air Force passengers. The flight was recorded as passing Middleton Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Around 4pm, a distress call was received by the pilot of a Northwest Orient Airlines passenger aircraft. The reception was very poor, but the Northwest captain made out the sentence: \\"As long as we have to land, we might as well land here.\\" Weather near Elmendorf at the time was very bad with heavy clouds. The C-124 was flying without visual references, using just altitude, a radio beacon and a stopwatch. There was no further communication from the C-124 and it failed to arrive at Elmendorf as scheduled. The severe weather continued for three days, so searching was only able to begin on November 25. Thirty-two military aircraft searched the surrounding mountains and four Coast Guard vessels searched Prince William Sound. The wreckage of the aircraft was found on November 28, 1952, on the south side of Mount Gannett by Terris Moore from the Fairbanks Civil Air Patrol and Lieutenant Thomas Sullivan from the 10th Air Rescue Squadron. The pair spotted the tail section of the C-124 sticking out of the snow at an elevation of about , close to the summit of Mount Gannett. Sullivan and Moore recorded the location as being on the Surprise Glacier, which flows south and empties into Harriman Fjord. However, the 2012 rediscovery of the remains of the aircraft at the foot of Colony Glacier, where it enters Lake George, suggests that the actual crash location was a little further north on the Mount Gannett ice field, sufficient for the debris to be carried down the north-flowing Colony Glacier over the subsequent 60 years. Moore, who was a mountaineer and pilot as well as president of the University of Alaska, told journalists the C-124 \\"obviously was flying at full speed\\" and appeared to have slid down the cliffs of Mount Gannett and exploded. Wreckage was spread across several acres of the glacier. Moore surmised that the pilot had narrowly missed other Chugach Range peaks during his approach. \\"From this I conclude he was on instrument, flying blind, and probably crashed without any warning whatsoever to him directly into the southerly face of Mt. Gannett.\\" Moore reported finding blood on a blanket and noted the \\"sickly-sweet smell of death\\" at the site. It seemed clear that there were no survivors. Sullivan noted that recovery of remains would be very difficult as the glacier was already covered by fresh snow eight feet deep. Near the remains of the aircraft, drifted snow was piled up to hundreds of feet. Apparently, the crash had also triggered avalanches that had further buried the remains. Because of the difficult conditions, the recovery effort was terminated after a week and the victims' families were told they would have no remains to bury. The debris was then covered by snow and ice, and was lost for the next 60 years. At the time, this was only the second fatal accident for the C-124, and was by far the worst. However, the following year saw even more deadly crashes at Moses Lake, Washington, and Tachikawa, Japan, Overall, this was the fourth-worst accident involving a Douglas C-124. Discovery of remains On June 9, 2012, the crew of an Alaska Army National Guard helicopter on a training mission noticed a large yellow survival raft on the surface of the Colony Glacier above Inner Lake George. The site was nearly 14 miles from the 1952 crash location. The National Guard sent a team on foot to examine the site and they retrieved items that were identified as being from the crashed C-124. On June 13, 2012, Deputy Chief Rick Stone, J-2 Intelligence Directorate at the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, was assigned to investigate the wreckage. On June 28, 2012, the US military announced the discovery of the wreckage. The recovery operation was then taken over by the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, whose primary role is to search for US military personnel missing overseas. On June 18, 2014, after two seasons of operations on the glacier, the Department of Defense announced that the remains of 17 of the victims had been identified and would be returned to their families for burial. By 2019, the Department of Defense had increased the number of sets of remains identified to 40.

Life Born Frederick Catt at Gillingham, Kent, on 22 June 1828, he was fifth son of Jesse Catt a Kentish man by his wife Mary Pearse. After private schooling, he started before he was twenty in provincial journalism. In 1852 he settled in London and joined the parliamentary staff of The Times, of which his elder brother George was already a member at this time both he and George renounced the name Catt and adopted Clifford as their surname. This employment he combined with other work. He retained his connection with the provinces by acting as London correspondent of the Sheffield Daily Telegraph, a conservative journal, and in 1863 he became joint proprietor of the paper with William Christopher Leng. In 1866 Clifford went to Jamaica to report for The Times the royal commission of inquiry into the conduct of Governor Edward John Eyre. He helped in 1868 to found the Press Association, an institution formed to supply newspaper proprietors of London and the provinces with home and foreign news, and he acted as chairman of the committee of management during two periods of five years each, finally retiring in 1880. In 1877, with the failing health of the editor, John Thadeus Delane, Clifford was transferred by The Times from the reporters' gallery of the House of Commons to Printing House Square; and he acted as assistant editor until his own bad health caused him to resign in 1883. In parallel, Clifford had made a position as a legal writer. He was admitted to the Middle Temple on 3 November 1856, and was called to the bar on 10 June 1859. Clifford's Practice brought him work at the parliamentary bar. He took silk in 1894, and was elected a bencher of his inn on 18 May 1900. Clifford was a student of agricultural questions also, and a member of the Royal Botanic Society. He died at his residence, 24 Collingham Gardens, Earl's Court, on 30 December 1904. His library formed a three days' sale at Sotheby's (5‚Äì7 May 1905). He was a collector of fans and other works of art. Guild of Literature and Art In early life Clifford co-operated with Edward Bulwer, Charles Dickens, and other men of letters and artists in forming the Guild of Literature and Art, which was incorporated by private act of parliament in 1858. Clifford was a member of the council. The guild failed in its purposes, and Clifford and Sir John Richard Robinson, the last surviving members of the council, wound up its affairs in 1897 by means of an Act (60 & 61 Vict. c. xciii.) drafted by Clifford. They distributed the Funds and landed property (at Knebworth) between the Royal Literary Fund and the Artists' General Benevolent Institution. Works In 1870 Clifford, with his lifelong friend, Pembroke S. Stephens, K.C., published The Practice of the Court of Referees on Private Bills in Parliament. This textbook on private bill practice first embodied alterations in the procedure of the Court of Referees made by act of parliament (30 & 31 Vict. c. 136) and by standing orders of the House of Commons in 1867, and it contained the decisions as to the locus standi of petitioners during the sessions 1867-9. Clifford continued to act as joint editor of the Locus Standi Reports to the end of the session of 1884. The historical aspect of the practice especially interested him, and he published later The History of Private Bill Legislation (2 vols. 1885-1887). He wrote also: * The Steamboat Powers of Railway Companies (1865); * The Agricultural Lockout of 1874, with notes upon Farming and Farm Labour in the Eastern Counties (1875), based on letters in The Times; and * a short treatise on the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1875, reprinted from the Royal Agricultural Society's Journal, 1876. Family Clifford married in 1853 Caroline, third daughter of Thomas Mason of Hull; she died in 1900. His surviving family of four sons and two daughters presented in his memory a silver-gilt claret jug to the Middle Temple. His second son, Philip Henry Clifford (1856‚Äì1895), graduated B.A. in 1878 from Christ's College, Cambridge, and proceeded M.A. in 1881. He was also a barrister, and writer for The Times.

Because the Naturalization Act of 1870 had extended citizenship rights only to African Americans but not other ethnic groups, these laws relied on coded language excluding \\"aliens ineligible for citizenship\\" to prohibit primarily Chinese and Japanese immigrants from becoming landowners without explicitly naming any racial group.Lyon, Cherstin M. \\"Alien land laws\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 08 July 2014. Various alien land laws existed in over a dozen states before they were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1952. Like other discriminatory measures aimed at preventing minorities from establishing homes and businesses in certain areas, such as redlining and restrictive covenants, many alien land laws remained technically in effect, forgotten or ignored, for many years after enforcement of the laws fell out of practice.Prengaman, Peter. \\"Racist Statutes Under Siege\\" Los Angeles Times (29 September 2002). Retrieved 09 July 2014. Background \\"The Yellow Terror In All His Glory\\", 1899 editorial cartoon Resentment against Asian immigrants in the U.S. grew with their population. Although American businesses had initially recruited Chinese immigrants as a cheap labor source in the emerging railroad and mining industries (and, in the Reconstruction South, to replace slaves on sugar plantations) by the late 19th century, fears of a largescale \\"Mongolian\\" plot to take land and resources from white Americans became widespread.Matsumoto, Mieko. \\"Chinese Exclusion Act\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 10 July 2014. Contemporary newspapers and politicians cultivated the idea of a Yellow Peril: an imminent threat to white morality and economic interests posed by Chinese and other Asian immigrants. Nativist groups prevented the Naturalization Act of 1870 from granting citizenship rights (and therefore the ability to vote and serve on juries) to Asians, and successfully campaigned for laws to reduce and finally, with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, stop immigration from China. The end of Chinese immigration came around the same time as the opening of Japan, when Japanese citizens were for the first time in the nation's history allowed to emigrate to other countries, and Japanese soon replaced Chinese as the primary target for labor recruiters. New Japanese immigrants, including many recently released from indentured labor contracts with Hawaiian plantations, moved to rural areas in Western states and took up tenant farming, taking over land formerly occupied by Chinese farmers. The sharp increase in the population of Japanese residing in the U.S. and their success in the agricultural industry soon resulted in an exclusionary movement similar to that faced by the earlier wave of primarily Chinese workers. Following the pattern set by the anti-Chinese movement, anti- Japanese lobbyists first limited Japanese immigration to the U.S. with the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907 and then stopped East Asian immigration completely with the Immigration Act of 1924. The Cable Act of 1922 added further complications to the ban on citizenship for Asian immigrants, stripping U.S.-born women of their citizenship if they married men ineligible for naturalization. Meanwhile, alien land laws became a common tool to prevent Asian immigrants already in the country from becoming a permanent presence in hostile white communities.

It is a member of the NCAA's Division I for all sports; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; formerly Division I-A), the higher of two levels of NCAA Division I football competition. Member schools are located in Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and West Virginia. The Big 12 Conference is the second youngest of the major college athletic conferences in the United States, having formed in 1994 from a merger of one of the oldest conferences, the Big Eight, with four prominent colleges from Texas that had been members of the Southwest Conference. From its formation until 2011, its 12 members competed in two divisions. Two charter members left the conference in 2011, and in 2012, two more left, while another two joined from other conferences. In 2012, the Big 12 formed an alliance with the Southeastern Conference to host a joint post-season college bowl game between the champions of each conference, which would eventually become the Sugar Bowl.  Origins  = College Football Association last days = On June 27, 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma that the NCAA could not punish its membership for selling their media content. As a result, individual schools and athletic conferences were freed to negotiate contracts on their own behalf. The Big Ten and Pacific-10 conferences sold their rights to ABC. Most of the rest of the Division I-A football programs (what is now called the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision) chose to sell their rights together through an organization called the College Football Association to ABC and CBS. The primary function of the CFA was to negotiate television broadcast rights for its member conferences and independent colleges. By 1990, the television landscape had changed and a number of the stronger programs saw opportunities for better deals outside of the CFA. Notre Dame left the CFA and sold their home game broadcast rights to NBC. When the Southeastern Conference (SEC) invited the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina to join in 1990, it created shockwaves across the CFA. The other CFA conferences correctly assumed the SEC made these additions to create a better TV product with the idea of leaving the CFA. The SEC represented one of the more valuable CFA assets. It seemed likely that if the SEC departed, the other conferences could have difficulty securing good TV deals. After Arkansas' departure from the Southwest Conference, the SWC and Big Eight Conference recognized they were in a poor position. The SEC, with about 18% of the nation's TV audience, had a very strong TV position. The Big 8 had an 8.1% share. The Texas-based SWC had an even weaker hand with only 6.7%. In February 1994, the SEC announced that it would leave the CFA and negotiate independently for a television deal that covered SEC schools only. This led The Dallas Morning News to proclaim that \\"the College Football Association as a television entity is dead\\". In 1995, the SEC and the Big East broke from the CFA, signing a national deal with CBS. The SEC would earn a staggering $95 million from the deal. More significantly, this change in television contracts ultimately would lead to significant realignment of college conferences. = The Southwest Conference = For decades the Southwest Conference (SWC) was one of the most dominant football conferences in America. It was seen as a football peer to other elite conferences like the Pac-10, Big 10, SEC and Big Eight. Then in 1960, professional football came to Dallas and Houston. Attendance at Rice collapsed. For over two decades, the SWC membership struggled with the issue. In 1974 a lengthy Texas Monthly article detailed the attendance decline at Rice, SMU, and TCU, and suggested the SWC was in trouble because the University of Texas felt like it was subsidizing the conference. The conference collapsed in 1994. Though it was not the only conference engaging in recruitment violations, the SWC ranked as one of the worst. At one point, seven of the nine SWC schools‚ÄîArkansas and Rice were the only exceptions‚Äîwere under some sort of NCAA sanction. SMU was given the \\"death penalty\\" for their rule violations. By 1986, SWC schools' NCAA penalties and bowl game ineligibilities had begun to compromise the SWC brand, driving top Texas talent out of state. Even top schools that had mostly stayed clear of trouble found their recruiting diminished. After years of SWC schools doing well in bowls, they suddenly could not compete with the elite schools of other conferences. A December 18, 1986 Dallas Morning News article stated: \\"Recruiting experts say the allegations have chased Texas's home-grown talent to other conferences. And while other conferences raid the state, the SWC stays at home, making do with a shrinking talent pool. Earlier this month, seven of the Dallas area's leading recruits‚Äîincluding running back Barry Foster of nearby Duncanville, Texas, The Dallas Morning News Offensive Player of the Year‚Äîsaid they no longer were interested in the SWC, calling it 'shaky' or 'screwed-up.' Said Bennie Perry, a defensive back from Bryan Adams High School in Dallas: 'You couldn't pay me to go to a Southwest Conference school, because they're getting into too much trouble.'\\" As sanctions began to sap the quality of play at the top of the conference, the big three began to actively look at other conferences. In attempts to appease the conference powers, the other members made financial rule changes, eventually including allowing home teams to keep their gate revenue (gate revenue was a much larger portion of operating funds at that time). These efforts fell short of satisfying the bigger issues UT and A&M; had with the SWC, but would appear to have played a role in UT's position going forward on revenue sharing. Eventually, Arkansas departed for the SEC, effective July 1, 1991 (the Razorbacks competed in the SWC during the 1991 football season). The SEC comprised primarily rural public schools (Vanderbilt was, and still is, the only private school in the SEC) that drew well and the conference had a much larger share of the nation's TV markets. As game day attendance and TV revenue drove athletic budgets, the SEC represented a much more financially sound organization. UT athletic director DeLoss Dodds reflected on the importance of Arkansas' departure, saying, ‚ÄúWhat had to happen, [was] there had to be a crisis for change.‚Äù Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles, who played at Georgia Tech when the Yellow Jackets competed in the SEC, said that he was encouraged to leave by UT's and Texas A&M;'s leaders, because it would destabilize the conference, allowing them to do the same. The leaderships at UT and Texas A&M; believed they would never be allowed to leave first. (In the summer of 1990, word would leak of Texas and Texas A&M; thinking of following Arkansas into the SEC. Reaction in Texas would be very negative, with politicians threatening both schools' funding before the idea was tabled.) The Southwest Conference could not find a replacement its membership would agree upon. The private schools were in denial of the depth of problems facing the conference. They suggested simply replacing Arkansas, a public school, with private schools BYU or Tulane, which left the SEC in 1966. With four private schools and four public schools already in the SWC, adding either choice could potentially give the private schools a voting majority. Private or not, UT and Texas A&M; were dead set against replacing Arkansas. The NCAA sanctions and Arkansas' departure made the conference appear broken to fans in Texas. Texas and Texas A&M;'s leaderships felt the conference was inherently flawed, with too many mouths to feed off too few TVs. Adding a single school was not going to change that dynamic, it would only create the public perception of a healed conference and prolong UT and Texas A&M;'s suffering. = \\"Predatory\\" conferences = Missouri showed interest in Big Ten membership after Penn State joined. Around 1993, the Big Ten explored adding Kansas, Missouri and Rutgers, or other potential schools, to create a 14-team league with two divisions. In the early 1990s, Texas had discussions with the Pac-10, a conference with similar academic views. An affiliation with the Pac-10 appealed to UT leaders. Former UT president Robert Berdahl told Mark Wagrin of the San Antonio Express-News: ‚ÄúTexas wanted desperately the academic patina that the Pac 10 yielded... To be associated with UCLA, Stanford and Cal in academics was very desirable.‚Äù The Pac-10 wanted to add UT and the University of Colorado. For some reason, an offer didn't come until after the formation of the Big 12. Some reports state that Stanford refused to vote to admit UT in an effort to protect the Cardinal's conference dominance in non-revenue sports. (The Pac-10 required unanimous votes for expansion.) (At the end of 1994, UT's Athletic Director Deloss Dodds, as he was turning down the Pac-10, stated that the Pac-10 leadership informed UT they would have a standing invitation for the Longhorns. What is unclear, is when the Pac-10 made that offer, although Dodds did use the word \\"always\\" in describing the offer.) One report stated that the offer was changed to UT and Texas A&M.; UT reportedly tried to carry Texas A&M; with them into the Pac-10. No evidence confirms Pac-10 support for that idea. This change allegedly upset the leadership at Colorado and drove them to take a more active role in protecting the Big Eight. (Colorado's Chancellor James Corbridge was also the Big Eight chairman. He was very involved with the TV negotiations for the new conference and the integration of the Texas schools.) UT then approached the Big 10, but was turned down, because the conference had recently instituted a moratorium on expansion. Texas then turned to the SEC, and negotiations reached an advanced stage. UT abruptly withdrew after concluding that the SEC had no interest in strengthening academics. Berdahl said, ‚ÄúWe were quite interested in raising academic standards... And the Southeastern Conference had absolutely no interest in that.‚Äù Texas A&M; had flirted with the SEC since the late 1980s. In 1993, it had approached the conference about joining, partnered with the University of Houston. UT had given up on the SEC and Texas A&M;'s leadership didn't want to try leaving the SWC on their own. The SEC moved expansion plans to the backburner. Then UT's interests turned to the Big Eight. Texas and Oklahoma's leaders both looked favorably on the idea of being in the same conference, but both schools had other options. Former Kansas State University president Jon Wefald voiced fears that if UT had joined the Pac-10, there would be no way for the Big Eight to ramp up their TV payouts in order to keep Oklahoma from joining the SEC for more lucrative TV payouts. = Negotiations with Texas and other schools = The Big Eight had been in pursuit of some kind of alliance with the Southwest Conference since Arkansas's departure destabilized that historic conference. The Big Eight and SWC members saw the potential financial benefits from an alliance to negotiate television deals, but a true alliance of 16 teams which would retain the seven other SWC schools was not viewed as optimal by UT. Dodds and the Longhorn leadership viewed proposals of this sort as continuing business as usual in the SWC. Arkansas's departure allowed UT and Texas A&M; to clear four or more less profitable dates from their football schedules and eight or more from their basketball schedules. For years the Big Eight could not interest UT in a merger. Without Texas to ensure the retention of Oklahoma, the Big Eight was not interested. Reports at the end of 1993 disclosed the discussions of the Big Eight about adding BYU and half of the SWC, with SMU, TCU, Rice and Houston \\"priced out\\" of the new conference. The Big Eight began negotiations with ABC and ESPN for a new conference that would feature football powers Nebraska, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Texas. = Texas politicians = After the SEC announced their intent to leave the CFA, the Big 8 and SWC members re-opened discussions to sell their rights together. In a book called \\"The Baylor Project\\" by Barry G. Hankins and Donald D. Schmeltekoff about Baylor's place in Christian higher education on page 68 states that on February 11, 1994, SWC member schools' leaders met a few Big 8 leaders in Dallas to discuss potentially selling both leagues' media content in a package deal. Discussions broke down on February 16, reportedly over UT's interest in the Pac-10. The Big Eight began negotiating a deal that would include the full SWC as a partner and Texas A&M; approached the SEC. In Texas, word leaked out that UT & Texas A&M; were close to leaving the SWC; UT to the Pac-10 or Big Eight and eventually Texas A&M; to the SEC. Texas state senator David Sibley, a Baylor alumnus and member of the Senate Finance Committee, approached UT Chancellor Bill Cunningham and asked him pointedly whether UT planned to leave the SWC on its own for the Big Eight. Cunningham tried to change the subject. Ultimately he did not deny it. Sibley approached LT Governor Bob Bullock, a Texas Tech alumnus. Texas state senator John Montford of Lubbock was equally motivated to protect Texas Tech's path to the Big 12. The trio put together a group of legislators who worked to insure those schools were part of any new sport conference. Bullock called together a meeting of supportive legislators as well as UT's and Texas A&M;'s leaders on February 20, 1994. UT Chancellor William Cunningham admitted that Texas planned to join the Big Eight and A&M;'s leadership still targeted the SEC. A deal was worked out where all four schools would go together to the Big 12. Baylor and Texas Tech would join the Aggies in coming with UT into the new version of the Big Eight. Texas's Governor Ann Richards, a Baylor and UT alumna, is often mistakenly credited with getting Baylor included, but, was absent from the February 20 meeting and no investigative reports confirm her active involvement. The Baylor Report claimed that she presented herself as neutral. Richards' former Chief of Staff, John Fainter, is on record saying \\"She just was not involved to any great degree in working that out...I'd have to say she was informed, but she wasn't pounding the table or anything like that.\\" Richards was aware of the public perception of her involvement and the thought amused her.) UT officials informed the Big Eight leadership that the Austin school was now receptive to an invitation and the Big Eight issued invitations to Texas, Texas A&M;, Baylor, and Texas Tech. All four schools quickly accepted.  Formation  On February 25, 1994, it was announced that a new conference would be formed from the members of the Big Eight and four of the Texas member colleges of the Southwest Conference. Though the name would not be made official for several months, newspaper accounts immediately dubbed the new entity the \\"Big 12\\". Charter members of the Big 12 included: Baylor University, the University of Colorado at Boulder, Iowa State University, University of Kansas, Kansas State University, the University of Missouri, the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State University‚ÄìStillwater, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M; University and Texas Tech University. Three months after formation, the schools of the new conference officially announced the conference's name: the Big 12 Conference. Although the new conference was essentially the Big Eight plus the four Texas schools, the Big 12 did not, and to this day still does not, claim the Big Eight's history as its own. Conference competition commenced on August 31, 1996. Seven cities were considered for the conference's headquarters including: Colorado Springs, Dallas, Denver, Kansas City (the former headquarters of the Big Eight), Lubbock, Texas, Oklahoma City, and Omaha, Nebraska before Dallas suburb Irving, Texas was chosen. From the conference's formation until the 2010‚Äì11 season, the Big 12 was split into two divisions for football. The Oklahoma and Texas schools formed the South Division, while the six northernmost schools formed the North Division. The Pacific-10 Conference (now known as the Pac-12) unanimously voted to offer memberships to UT and Colorado at the end of 1994, but UT declined, and the CU Regents also rejected the offer in a 6‚Äì3 vote, opting to stay in the new Big 12.  Future expansion  The four Southwest Conference schools were not the only candidates the Big Eight considered. After the Big 12 was founded, leaks in 1994 claimed that the conference also had a plan for a 14 team membership in order to secure a larger TV share than the SEC, something some of the conference leadership felt might be vital for its future TV negotiations. Reports confirmed that Brigham Young University and the University of New Mexico, then in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), were actively considered for Big 12 membership and if the conference should then decide to go to 16 schools, the University of Louisville and the University of Memphis would be favorites to fill those slots. In anticipation of the possibility of expansion to 14 by 1996, the new conference trademarked both \\"Big 12\\" and \\"Big 14\\". The idea was that BYU and New Mexico would raise the conference footprint to 20% of the nation's TV households while also giving the northern division another football powerhouse in BYU. Articles of the day suggested support for the idea was not uniform among Big 12 schools and many quotes suggested such an expansion discounted the possibility. UNM's athletic director Rudy Davalos, former athletic director at the University of Houston, questioned the logic of the Big 12 adding UNM. Davalos publicly expressed a commitment to the WAC. Former Baylor President Herbert H. Reynolds speaks of making the case to his board that much of the value of the Big 12 for Baylor arose from the Waco university being the only private school in the conference.\\"The Baylor Project\\" (page 73) TCU's AD at the time, Frank Windegger was told by colleagues that TCU was discussed as a package deal with BYU, with the idea even going to a vote --- but the expansion vote was narrowly defeated. Ultimately the conference chose to stay at 12 members. BYU's athletic director Clayne Jensen told the press that while the addition of BYU could likely pay for the Cougars' admission as the conference's 13th member, it appeared no other candidate school made financial sense to allow to become the 14th member. The greater influence held by the schools in the southern division would later be cited repeatedly as a key component in Nebraska's eventual decision to leave.  Conference realignment  Locations of the Big 12 Conference full-member institutions. During the 2010‚Äì14 NCAA conference realignment, the Big 12 was one of the more heavily impacted. Persistent rumors of the Pac-10 and Big Ten targeting key members created unease and suspicion. Questions about TV contracts and dissatisfaction with the Big 12's policy of unequal revenue sharing created more conflict. This erosion of trust allowed other conferences to raid the Big 12. The Big 12 lost four members between 2010 and 2013, replaced by two others. Remaining below 12 members would end the Big 12's divisional format, as the NCAA only allows football championship games in conferences with at least twelve teams. Following these departures, the Conference chose to retain the \\"Big 12\\" name and logo despite dropping to ten schools, a marketing decision similar to the Big Ten Conference's choice to keep its name after its membership increased to 11 in 1990 with the addition of Penn State (its membership now stands at 14 with the later additions of Nebraska, Maryland and Rutgers). This decision by the Big 12 reminded fans of the near collapse of the conference in the realignment period and to suggest the limited expansion options facing the conference. = 2010 =  Destabilization  In May 2010, reports speculated that the Big 12 Conference was on the verge of dissolution. In February, reports stated the desire by the Pac-10 to expand the conference. The article said that the only school that \\"moved the needle\\" financially for the Pac-10 was Texas. In March, the Big Ten received the initial report from consultants hired to investigate five potential expansion candidates, including Missouri. The initial report supported the expansion. On April 20 and May 3, Sports Illustrated predicted that the Big Ten would ultimately add Nebraska. Later in May the Big Ten Conference reportedly issued \\"initial offers\\" to Missouri, Nebraska, Notre Dame and Rutgers.Dawg Talkers Message Boards: Big 10 makes offers to 4 schools for expansion On May 12, Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany emailed conference officials, denying that any offers had been made. The league planned to take no action until the league Presidents met in June. During the Big 12 meetings in June, the Pac-10 was rumored to be on the verge of inviting Colorado, Texas, Texas A&M;, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State to join them, a proposal that was dubbed Pac-16. The Pac-10 had tried to land Texas and Colorado in 1994. This new offer acknowledged that Texas was unlikely to leave the Big 12 without Oklahoma due to the Red River Rivalry's importance to UT's athletic budget. Both schools had in-state rival schools that needed to be included. Although the Pac-10's attempt bears a number of similarities to the Big 8's raid of the SWC, fans of the targeted Texas schools were resistant. This suggested that the Pac-10 leadership did a poor job of selling the benefits of Pac-10 membership. The Pac-12 was considered too distant for many fans. In contrast, Big 12 concerns about travel distance tended to originate from Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston, cities whose schools were to be excluded. Rumors that the Big Ten was interested in Texas also emerged. Texas Athletic Director Deloss Dodds openly talked about both rumors in the media. On June 3, Texas A&M; athletic director Bill Byrne said that the Aggies might consider joining the SEC, should the Big 12 collapse. Texas and Texas A&M; held veto power over each other that would keep them in the same conference. UT was struggling to hold the Big 12 together, contrary to public perception. The Big 10 was rumored to be considering adding Missouri and leaving Nebraska stranded in the remains of the Big 12, while the state of Texas reportedly might allow Texas A&M; to go the SEC, but that UT would likely not play the Aggies should they leave.Orangebloods.com - Exclusive: Pac-10 set to invite six from Big 12  Unequal revenue  One point of contention in the Big 12 was the unequal distribution of TV revenue, as was common in most other top conferences. Nebraska, Texas, Texas A&M;, and Oklahoma objected to equal sharing, according to former Commissioner Dan Beebe. Four votes gave them the ability to block revenue sharing votes. After his 2011 firing, Beebe said that Oklahoma, Nebraska, and even Texas A&M; were interested in \\"developing their own distribution systems\\" for sports programs.  Raids begin  On June 5, a movement was reportedly building in Texas to force the Pac-10 to invite Baylor instead of Colorado. This would give Texas a solid voting block of 4 Texas schools and two strongly aligned Oklahoma schools. The Pac-10 quickly eliminated that possibility by modifying their original offer (a package deal for all six schools) to be a standalone offer for Colorado and a package deal for the other five. On June 10, Colorado joined the Pac-10, to be effective in 2012, but later advanced to July 1, 2011.Done deal: Colorado to join Pac-10; what's next for Baylor?  Dallas Morning News Pac-12 Conference: About us Retrieved August 29, 2011 Colorado reportedly accepted quickly for fear that Baylor would force its way in, leaving Colorado in a dissolving conference. On June 11, Nebraska applied for and was accepted into the Big Ten, effective July 1, 2011. The departures of the Texas teams to the Pac-10 was reportedly imminent, including a possibility that Texas A&M; might instead choose the SEC.  June 14 agreement  On June 14, the Big 12 announced a deal to save the conference. Lobbying by Baylor, Iowa State, Kansas, Kansas State and Missouri, supported by pressure from other programs who did not want elite conferences to become 16-team \\"superconferences\\". The deal required a restructured revenue sharing agreement that guaranteed Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas A&M; $20 million each per year (the other schools would split the rest) and an unexpectedly lucrative television deal if the conference stayed together. With the big three securing payments that more or less matched what they would have received in a Pac-16 and Texas committing to the conference, Oklahoma stayed and Texas A&M;'s exit was temporarily obscured. In the 2010 round of realignment, UT had secured a better conference TV deal and a bigger share of that deal and gained what Dodds considered an easier path to the national title game. It also was permitted its own network (the Longhorn Network) and had gotten Nebraska out of the conference.Pigskin Punditry: Only One Winner in the Expansion Game However, the $20 million payouts did not soothe hard feelings at Texas A&M; and Oklahoma. Texas A&M; and Oklahoma ended contact with the Southeastern Conference, which had been pursuing both schools as potential candidates if their conference decided to expand past 12 members. On June 16, 2010, Houston state lawmakers Garnet Coleman and Bill Callegari co-wrote a letter asking Big 12 officials to consider adding the University of Houston (a Conference USA member) to the Big 12. = 2011 =  Grant of Rights agreement  Following the near disaster in 2010, the other five pushed for a spring vote on a \\"Grant of Rights\\" deal that would grant all sports media rights of member schools to the conference. This would make it very difficult for a key school to leave. The proposal needed a 75% majority, but was defeated by Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&M.;  Longhorn Network  ESPN planned to launch the Longhorn Network and to include Texas High School football games. Oklahoma and Texas A&M; objected that doing so would create a recruiting advantage for the Longhorns. Texas A&M; went so far as to accuse Texas of violating NCAA rules. In addition to a non-conference game each season, ESPN wanted a Big 12 Conference game on the Longhorn Network. At the same Big 12 meeting discussing high school football broadcasts, it was agreed that a conference game would be acceptable as long as both schools and the conference office approved the broadcast.Big 12 sets up restrictions on Longhorn Network, Houston Chronicle, retrieved 1 August 2011 It was reported that ESPN asked Texas Tech for permission to broadcast their November 5 game against the Longhorns on the network. ESPN told the university that the game would most likely not be carried on an ESPN network, leaving LHN as the only option. In return, ESPN promised to televise two non-conference football games over the next four seasons, broadcast some other non-football programming, $5 million cash and help from the network to try to arrange a home-and-home series against a top BCS conference school. Texas Tech passed on the offer, explaining, \\"I don't want a Tech fan to have to give one dime to the Longhorn Network\\".Tech says no to Longhorn Network , Amarillo Globe-News, retrieved 9 August 2011 ESPN then contacted Oklahoma State, without success. Texas Athletics eventually announced that the Kansas Jayhawks had agreed to let their game against the Longhorns on October 29 be shown on the network (KU's third tier media rights are also managed by LHN co-owner IMG College). The agreement allowed the Longhorn Network to be the national carrier of the game except in Kansas markets, where the game was shown on local network affiliates.Texas-Kansas football game to air on Longhorn Network, TexasSports.com, retrieved 2 September 2011  Texas A&M;  In August 2011, A&M; announced plans to apply to join an unspecified conference. Its desire to leave the Big 12 was presented as concerns about conference stability and the Longhorn Network. On September 2, David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma, announced that his school was actively re-evaluating its conference membership. Having moved on from its SEC flirtation over concerns of a booster-led backslide into recruiting violations, Oklahoma began pursuing Pac-12 membership in a package deal with Oklahoma State, due to its frustration with the Big 12. Dodds and UT president William Powers attempted to convince OU to stay, but they were unsuccessful. OU reportedly liked the potential of upgrading their academic and research reputation in an effort to earn AAU status in addition to their football coaching staff's desire to expand recruiting efforts into California. Having just expanded to 12 and landed a very lucrative TV deal, the Pac-12 leaders were not actively looking to expand again. They opted to wait until the SEC added Texas A&M; before inviting the Oklahoma schools. In mid- September, the SEC accepted Texas A&M; as its thirteenth member, conditional upon a reaffirmation that the Big 12 would not pursue legal action. The SEC later reported that they had been assured that the Big 12 would waive its rights to legal action. However, Baylor rejected that they had waived their school's rights to pursue legal action for tortious interference. Several other Big 12 schools adopted Baylor's position. The SEC leadership were angry and embarrassed about being misled. On September 25, the SEC announced that Texas A&M; was being accepted unconditionally‚Äîregardless of legal threats. Texas A&M; announced the school would officially join the SEC on July 1, 2012. As part of Texas A&M;'s settlement for their exit, the Big 12 Conference withheld $12.4 million of Big 12 revenue otherwise due to Texas A&M.;  Media rights and expansion  The Big 12 said it would form a committee to replace Texas A&M; with at least one other school. The Oklahoma schools, eager for a long-term home, were reportedly still considering applying to the Pac-12, while the other five schools entered talks with the Big East. Big East, Big 12 talk merger if Texas, Oklahoma leave Big 12 - NCAA Football - CBSSports.com Further realignment was temporarily halted on September 20, when the Pac-12 reiterated its desire to remain a twelve-school conference, as Texas would not compromise on the Longhorn Network or commit to equal revenue sharing. The Pac-12 also publicly confirmed the lack of support for adding Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. After Oklahoma and Oklahoma State's path to the Pac-12 crumbled, an Oklahoma source leaked to the media that Oklahoma was just attempting to use the threat of departure to reform the Big 12. With no prospect of Pac-12 membership, Oklahoma and Texas's positions changed dramatically and preserving the Big 12 became those schools' primary goal. Missouri and Oklahoma in particular would play a leadership role in stabilizing the Big 12. On September 23, Missouri Chancellor Brady Deaton, the Chairman of the Big 12 Board of Directors, announced that the conference presidents agreed in principle to pursue granting member school media rights to the conference. Oklahoma's President David Boren called the agreement \\"'essential' for the league‚Äôs future\\". UT's Deloss Dodds had opposed the idea saying, \\"UT officials 'don‚Äôt want to sign over' any TV rights to the league\\", the day before all the league's presidents (including UT's) endorsed the idea. The same day, the Big 12 announced the departure of Commissioner Dan Beebe, who was seen as dominated by Texas, replaced by Interim commissioner Chuck Neinas, a former Big Eight commissioner. Neinas took over on October 3.  Broadcast revenue  On October 5 the Big 12 agreed to equally distribute Tier I and II television revenues. Dodds had long been firmly against equal sharing of TV revenue, but UT blessed the deal to stabilize the conference. On October 6, the Big 12 Conference Board of Directors, acting upon a unanimous recommendation of the expansion committee, authorized negotiations with Texas Christian University (TCU) to become a member. TCU had recently agreed to join the Big East Conference. but their fans had wanted to be in the Big 12 since the SWC crashed. On October 10, Texas Christian University's Board of Trustees voted to accept the invitation, joining on July 1, 2012. A Big 12 official named Brigham Young University and the University of Louisville as other expansion candidates. It would later leak that the Big 12's television partners were unenthusiastic about BYU. With the loss of Texas A&M; and its Aggie fan base, the conference thought there was now a need/opening for another Texas school. While the TCU fan base was significantly smaller, TCU was in a good location. With the SEC now having a significant Texas presence, adding Dallas/Fort Worth-based TCU made sense in terms of protecting the other Texas and Oklahoma schools' access to DFW-area recruiting. TCU had long rivalries with several Big 12 schools, notably with Baylor, dating back to 1899.  Missouri leaves  By rushing the addition of the Aggies, the SEC had created a two division, 13 team conference for 2012. They needed an acceptable 14th team immediately to ease the scheduling issues created by the Aggies. The Big 12 had plenty of strong candidates and was still unstable. Despite the work of the Missouri Chancellor to evolve the Big 12, on October 4, Missouri's Board of Curators authorized the school's president to explore applying to other conferences. A year earlier, speculation grew that Missouri was interested in becoming the Big Ten's twelfth member and was the favorite, but instead Nebraska became the choice. On October 6, the day after the revenue sharing change, the Big 12 Board of Directors voted 8‚Äì0 to formally grant their media rights to the conference. On advice of the Missouri legal counsel, Missouri opted not to vote. On October 11, Neinas stated that Missouri would remain for the 2012 season. In spite of Neinas's statement, on October 21 its Board of Curators authorized Chancellor Deaton to move the school out of the Big 12 Conference should that be in the school's best interest. The Big 12 began looking for a suitable replacement school that could start play in 2012. On November 6, Missouri officially announced that it would join the Southeastern Conference effective July 1, 2012. As compensation for the departure, the Big 12 withheld $12.4 million of the revenue it would have shared with Missouri; additionally, they announced that Missouri would not share the revenue from a newly signed contract between the Big 12 Conference and Fox Sports. Missouri also agreed to pay the Big 12 Conference for its share of officiating costs of its final year in the conference, as it had done in prior years (an estimated payment of $500,000).  West Virginia replaces Missouri  On October 25, word leaked that West Virginia would replace Missouri. The next day the New York Times reported the Big 12 had backed off their verbal commitment to West Virginia and was now split between Louisville and West Virginia after some Big 12 leaders were lobbied by U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell. West Virginia cancelled plans for a press conference. The conference requested that West Virginia supply it with more information. On October 28, WVU officially joined the Big 12 and committed to begin play in the 2012 season. The Mountaineers' former conference, the Big East Conference, required 27 months of notice prior to withdrawal, as drafted by West Virginia's legal team. Big East Commissioner John Marinatto said that West Virginia would not be allowed to leave before July 1, 2014. In response, West Virginia filed a lawsuit to declare invalid the withdrawal-notice requirement stipulated in the Big East's bylaws. The lawsuit alleged that the Big East breached its fiduciary duty by allowing several football-playing members to depart, causing the conference to no longer be a major football conference and jeopardizing its continued existence. Because of this, West Virginia alleged, its continued performance under the contract had become unreasonably burdensome and its original purpose in entering into the contract had been eliminated. West Virginia stated its belief that its notice to withdraw in 2012 was indeed accepted, when the Big East Conference accepted its payment of half the $5 million withdrawal penalty. Marinatto denied the allegations. The Big East countersued. West Virginia's request to dismiss the suit was denied. The Big East Conference's lawsuit was scheduled to begin arguments in April 2012, but on February 14, 2012, West Virginia announced that it had settled. This cleared the final hurdle for West Virginia. While terms of the settlement were confidential, West Virginia's athletic director said that the settlement would be paid only from private donations and money the athletes raised. According to an anonymous source, the Big East would be paid $20 million, including $11 million from West Virginia and $9 million by the Big 12. The agreement apparently stipulated that WVU's $2.5 million exit fee and revenue-sharing money would be applied towards the settlement. =2016= On July 19, 2016, Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby announced that the conference had authorized him to begin talks with schools that were interested in joining the conference. Schools that have been linked to the expansion or have publicly expressed interest in joining the conference include Boise State University, Brigham Young University Cougars, Colorado State University Rams, the University of Central Florida Knights, the University of Cincinnati Bearcats, the University of Connecticut Huskies, the University of Houston Cougars, the University of Memphis Tigers, the University of New Mexico Lobos, Southern Methodist University, the University of South Florida Bulls and the San Diego State University Aztecs. On September 2, 2016, ESPN reported that the University of Memphis was officially ruled out as a potential member.

Life A great-grandson of Bishop Robert Skinner, Skinner was born on 22 October 1689, the third and youngest son of Robert Skinner of Welton, Northamptonshire, and of the Inner Temple. His father was judge of the Marshalsea court, and law reporter. Skinner entered Westminster School at the age of 14. Elected to a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford, he matriculated on 18 June 1709, and entered Lincoln's Inn on 20 June 1709. Skinner was called to the bar on 21 April 1716, and joined the Oxford circuit. In 1719 he purchased from Simon Urling (later recorder of London), a place as one of the four common pleaders of the city of London, who then enjoyed the exclusive right and privilege of practising in the lord mayor's court. He was chosen as recorder of Oxford on 30 May 1721 and gave up his place as common pleader in 1722 to Thomas Garrard (later common serjeant of London). Skinner's practice grew rapidly, and he was called to the rank of serjeant-at-law in Easter term, 1 February 1724, was made one of the king's serjeants on 11 June 1728, and became his majesty's prime (or first) serjeant by letters patent on 12 May 1734. He served as treasurer of Serjeants' Inn in 1728. After trying unsuccessfully to enter parliament for at the 1727 British general election, Skinner, who lived at Oxford from 1722 to 1739, was chosen Member of Parliament for the Oxford constituency at the general election of 1734. He was chosen as a Tory, but he soon went over to the Government. On 16 May 1737, he spoke in favour of the bill against the provost and city of Edinburgh after the Porteous riots. Skinner was appointed chief justice of Chester, and of the great sessions for the counties of Flint, Denbigh, and Montgomery and vacated his seat in Parliament on 26 November 1738. He occupied this judicial position, together with the recordership of Oxford, for the rest of his life. He was the second counsel for the Crown in the prosecution of Jacobite rebels on the northern circuit in July 1746; and led for the crown at Arthur Elphinstone, 6th Lord Balmerinoch's trial in the House of Lords the same year. Skinner died at Oxford on 21 October 1749, and was buried in Oxford Cathedral. Works Skinner published his father's Reports of Cases decided in the Court of King's Bench, 33 Charles II to 9 William III in 1728. Family Skinner married, in 1719, Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Whitfield of Watford Place, Hertfordshire. His eldest son died on 8 April 1735; while another son, Matthew Skinner, was also a barrister of Lincoln's Inn.

The New Geneva Glass Works was an early American glass factory established in western Pennsylvania, active from 1797 until 1847. In 1795, Albert Gallatin gathered several investors together as Albert Gallatin & Company to purchase tracts of land including the towns of Wilson's Port, Georgetown, and unused lots across the Monongahela River in Greensboro. They named the community New Geneva and built a general store, gun factory, sawmill, and a gristmill. Several years later, in 1797, Albert Gallatin & Company partner John Baddolet wrote to Gallatin about a group of German glassblowers who wanted to build a glass factory in the area. John Gabler, Adolph Eberhart, George Reppert, Lewis Reitz, Baltzer Kramer, and Christian Kramer had the skills and knowledge of glassmaking, but needed the capital and land for a glassworks. Gallatin, Badollet, and the glassblowers entered into the venture, along with partners James Nicholson, Louis Bourdillon, and Charles A. Cazenove. The first glasshouse was built near Georges Creek and production began on January 18, 1798. The glassblowers mainly produced window glass, although whiskey bottles, bowls, and other hollow ware were also made. Production soon grew to an annual average of 4,000 boxes of window glass. At the same time, the company was troubled by supply and production issues, including properly curing the wood they used for fuel, cleaning the sand used to make the glass, preparing batches of glass, and obtaining clay used to make furnace pots. Gallatin maintained a half interest in the glassworks and provided all the sand and wood used until 1803. That May, he posted an advertisement in the Tree of Liberty, a Pittsburgh newspaper, announcing an auction of his interest in the glassworks, a ferry across the Monongahela River, and several properties in the town of New Geneva. There were no offers, and Gallatin sold his company shares to his partners. Shortly afterward, the partners decided to move the glassworks across the river to Greensboro and replaced wood with coal as their source of fuel. The Greensboro factory functioned from 1807 into the late 1840s, but closed in 1847 because it could no longer compete with newer, nearby glasshouses. In 1837, the sons of Reitz and the Kramers (New Geneva's first glassblowers) founded a second glassworks in New Geneva and produced the same products as the earlier factories. The firm existed until 1857, when the last glass was made by John Gabler and Charles Kramer.

The squadron carried large quantities of mail, freight and later, passengers between Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as to locations in Europe and Africa. 168 Squadron RCAF Boeing Fortress Mk. IIIA Before October 1943, the Canadian Government had sent mail to Canadian service personnel in the United Kingdom by ship. However, high ship losses and the importance of mail to service personnel prompted the government to switch to air mail. The Squadron's primary role was to deliver mail to Europe, initially using six surplus Boeing Fortress heavy bomber aircraft acquired from the United States. All of the Fortresses were in poor condition when received and the RCAF made numerous modifications to the Fortresses, including the removal of the machine guns and their turrets and the installation of a replacement solid nose that increased the quantity of mail that could be carried. The paint was later stripped off the airframes to further lighten them. The first scheduled mail flight was carried out by Fortress 9204 on 15 December 1943 with 2 passengers and of mail after the aircraft intended for this flight, 9202 was grounded due to a mechanical problem. On 2 April 1944, Fortress 9207 crashed shortly after take off from Glasgow Prestwick Airport, killing all five crew members. In August 1944, the RCAF added the first of several Consolidated Liberators to the Squadron's strength. In addition to the Fortresses and Liberators, 168 Squadron also operated Douglas Dakotas and Lockheed Lodestar transports.Kostenuk, 1977, p.73 A single Beechcraft Expeditor was loaned to the unit in 1944 from No. 12 (Communications) Squadron, and Lockheed Hudson Mk.III BW619 was borrowed in 1944 for mail runs in the Mediterranean.

Together with its derivative AGARD-C it belongs to a family of AGARD standard wind tunnel models. Its origin dates to the year 1952, and the Second Meeting of the AGARD Wind Tunnel and Model Testing Panel in Rome, Italy, when it was decided to define two standard wind tunnel model configurations (AGARD-A and AGARD-B) to be used for exchange of test data and comparison of test results of same models tested in different wind tunnels. The idea was to establish standards of comparison between wind tunnels and improve the validity of wind tunnel tests. Among the standard wind tunnel models, AGARD model configuration B (AGARD-B) has become by far the most popular. Initially intended for the supersonic wind tunnels, the AGARD-B configuration has since been tested in many wind tunnels at a wide range of Mach numbers, from low subsonic (Mach 0.1), through transonic (Mach 0.7 to 1.4) to hypersonic (up to Mach 8 and above). Therefore, a considerable database of test results is available. AGARD-B (see figure) is a body-wing configuration. All its dimensions are given in terms of the body diameter \\"D\\" so that the model can be produced in any scale, as appropriate for a particular wind tunnel. The body is an 8.5 diameters long solid of revolution consisting of a 5.5 diameters long cylindrical segment and a nose with a length of 3 diameters and having a local radius defined by the equation . The wing is a delta in the form of an equilateral triangle with a span of four body diameters. Wing section is a symmetric cylindrical arc with a relative thickness t/c of 4%. Leading and trailing edges of the wing should be rounded with a radius equal to . However, this specification is unclear. It is obvious that the specified radius can not be applied near the wingtips, or large deformations in the plan form of the wing would occur. In the past, this part of the specification was interpreted in different ways by model designers which led to small differences in shapes of the tested models. The recommended solutionHills R., \\"A Review of Measurements on AGARD Calibration Models\\" , AGARDograph 64, Aircraft Research Association Bedford, England, 1961 is to have the leading- and trailing-edge radii of at the theoretical root chord and to decrease the radii towards the wing tips proportionally to the local chord. A support sting to be used with the AGARD-B model was defined as well. The initial specificationSpecification for AGARD Wind Tunnel Calibration Models, AGARD memorandum, AGARD, 1955 of the model called for a sting having a diameter of and a length of . In the revised specification the length of the sting was changed to in order to reduce sting interference, but at that moment a number of wind tunnel tests had already been made. Therefore, published test results for the AGARD-B models do not all correspond to theoretical model configuration. The drag characteristics of the AGARD-B model were found to be somewhat sensitive to the boundary layer transition on the model. In order to reduce the scatter of results, in some wind tunnel facilities the model was tested with boundary layer transition trips near the leading edges of the wing and the nose of the body. On the other hand, a number of wind tunnel tests was made without fixed transition. Drag results with and without the fixed boundary layer transition differ, which should not be neglected when comparing test results from different wind tunnel laboratories. In some wind tunnel laboratories, AGARD-B was tested in non-standard configurations, e.g. as a half-model (half-span model).Aoki Y., Kanda H., Sato M., Nagai S., Itabashi Y., Nishijima H., Kimura T. \\"AGARD-B Standard Model Tests in JAXA 0.8 m by 0.45 m High Reynolds Number Transonic Wind Tunnel\\", JAXA-SP-09-005, Proceedings of the Wind Technology Association 81st meeting, 2009 Some free- flight tests of the AGARD-B model were performed. For these tests, the standard geometry was modified by adding, at the rear end of the body, two triangular vertical stabilisers, one on the ventral and one on the dorsal side of the body. Size of the vertical stabilizers was 50% of the wing size, i.e. their span was .Piland, R.O., \\"The Zero-Lift Drag of a 60o Delta-Wing-Body Combination (AGARD Model 2) Obtained from Free-Flight Tests Between Mach Numbers 0.8 and 1.7\\", NACA TN-3081, Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, NACA, 1954 AGARD-B standard model is intended primarily for the measurement of aerodynamic forces and moments. Test results are most often presented in the form of nondimensional aerodynamic coefficients in the wind axes system. Reference area for the calculation of the coefficients is the theoretical wing area . Reference length for the pitching moment coefficient is the mean aerodynamic chord (m.a.c.) equal to while the reference length for the yawing and rolling moment coefficients and is the wing span . Moments are reduced to a point in the plane of symmetry of the model, at the longitudinal position of 50% of the m.a.c. (however, in some published results,Anderson C.F., An Investigation of the Aerodynamic Characteristics of the AGARD Model B for Mach Numbers from 0.1 to 1.0, AEDC-TR-70-100, Arnold Engineering Development Center, 1970 moments were reduced to a point at 25% of the m.a.c.). Drag coefficient is presented in terms of forebody drag obtained by subtracting, from the total measured drag , the base drag computed from the measured base pressure on the model. Likewise, Lift coefficient represents forebody lift. Some laboratories have selected to test the AGARD-B standard model for periodic checkouts of the quality of measurements in their wind tunnels.Damljanovic D, Isakovic J. and Ra≈°uo B., \\"T-38 Wind-Tunnel Data Quality Assurance Based on Testing of a Standard Model\\", Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 50, No. 4 (2013), pp. 1141-1149. doi: 10.2514/1.C032081Damljanovic D., Vitic A., Vukovic √ê., Isakovic J., \\"Testing of AGARD-B calibration model in the T-38 Trisonic Wind Tunnel\\", Scientific Technical Review 56 (2), 2006, pp. 52-62  AGARD-C  A drawing defining the geometry of the AGARD-C standard model and its sting fixture figure above At the AGARD Wind Tunnel and Model Testing Panel meeting in Paris, France, in 1954, it was agreed to add a third model configuration to the family of AGARD calibration models, by extending the body of the AGARD-B by 1.5 diameters and by adding a horizontal and a vertical tail in the T-tail configuration. The horizontal tail has an area equal to 1/6 of the wing area. Sections of the vertical and horizontal tail are circular arc profiles defined identically to the profile of the wing. Forward of the 1.5 D body extension, the geometry of the AGARD-C model is identical to that of the AGARD-B. Also, the position of the moments reduction point (the aerodynamic centre) is the same as on AGARD-B. The support sting for the AGARD-C model is identical to the sting for the AGARD-B model, having a length of aft of model base and a diameter of . The longer body of the AGARD-C model and the existence of the tail make it easier to detect (from anomalies in the wind tunnel test results) if the shock waves reflected from the walls of the wind tunnel test section are passing too close to the rear end of the model. The existence of the tail generally makes this model more sensitive than AGARD-B to flow curvature in the wind tunnel test section.Damljanovic D., Vukovic √ê., Vitic A., Isakovic J., Ocokoljic G. \\"Observations on Some Transonic Wind Tunnel Tests of a Standard Model with a T-Tail\\", Scientific Technical Review 66 (4), 2016, pp. 34-39 AGARD-C is primarily used in the transonic wind tunnels and the database of published test results is somewhat smaller than the one for the AGARD-B model. In order to reduce cost and produce more versatile wind tunnel models, actual designs of AGARD-B and AGARD-C are sometimes realized as an AGARD-B configuration to which a body segment with the T-tail can be attached at the rear end to form the AGARD-C configuration (see figure).

To promote the album, Code Orange released music videos for the tracks \\"I Am King\\" and \\"Dreams in Inertia,\\" in addition to an online stream for \\"My World.\\"  Writing and recording  Code Orange entered the studio with Kurt Ballou in February 2014. Ballou is the guitarist of Converge and previously recorded Code Orange's 2012 debut album Love Is Love/Return to Dust. Code Orange drummer Jami Morgan described I Am King as a \\"different\\" album that will mark \\"a very new era for our band,\\" and also elaborated: \\"A lot of the heavier parts are heavier and sometimes more obvious. A lot of the odd parts are weirder and a little more anti-social. Things are a lot more blended together.\\" After the band wrote the \\"skeletons\\" of the songs for I Am King, Code Orange revisited the tracks to look for moments where they could, \\"incorporate these little sonic nuggets that excited us or intrigued us.\\" The songs were also influenced by metal acts such as the groove metal band Sepultura, metalcore band Prayer for Cleansing and grunge band Alice in Chains.  Promotion and marketing  Code Orange's panther-head logo used to tease and promote I Am King. Code Orange (then known as Code Orange Kids) began teasing the release of its sophomore album 7 months in advance in February 2014 by posting an image of a green panther with a black backdrop accompanied by the phrase \\"King 2014\\" on its social media sites. The following month, Code Orange launched a mysterious viral marketing campaign and website dubbed \\"Thinners of the Herd,\\" which asked for fans' names and home addresses. In June 2014, Code Orange released a music video for the title track, \\"I Am King,\\" directed by Max Moore. Writing for Exclaim!, Gregory Adams said \\"I Am King\\" is \\"a little gory\\" and also said, \\"While the black and white video strings together savage shots of the group ripping through fast and punchy hardcore licks and a monster of a mosh section from inside a straw- strewn barn, there's even more menacing footage mixed into the clip's runtime.\\" In July 2014, Code Orange released an online stream of the song \\"My World,\\" followed by a music video for \\"Dreams in Inertia\\" in August 2014, again directed by Max Moore. Writing for Fangoria, Samuel Zimmerman described the \\"Dreams in Inertia\\" video, stating: \\"Admittedly mellower (for a spell), the video for 'Dreams in Inertia' is full of occult vibes and lo-fi creep.\\" Adams also discussed the video, commenting: \\"While we see the band delivering the tune throughout the video, we also get a glimpse of a guy's bathtub purification and a dour crew's march through a forest filled with nooses. Code Orange meet up with the other faction late in the video to offer a few sips of Kool-Aid, which may not be a gesture of good faith.\\" I Am King was made available for online streaming in its entirety a week ahead of its release on August 26. For supporting tours, Code Orange performed sets of almost entirely new material from I Am King. In an interview about an upcoming show in Portland, Oregon, drummer Jami Morgan explained, \\"We're gonna play one song off [Love Is Love/Return to Dust] and that's it. Nothing else matters. To me, when you make a record that [makes you] feel like how we feel about this record, the other records don't matter. They're obsolete. They were on a path to get to this record.\\" Code Orange's first tour in support of I Am King was a brief stint opening for Killswitch Engage and Ringworm surrounding its participation in the This Is Hardcore festival on July 24, 2014. This was followed by a September‚ÄìOctober 2014 co-headlining tour with Twitching Tongues. Reception =Critical reception= Upon its release, I Am King received rave reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album received an average score of 87, which indicates \\"universal acclaim,\\" based on four reviews. Writing for Consequence of Sound Ryan Bray stated: \\"Guttural metalcore still reigns loudly over any dreamy, indie rock ambitions that Code Orange entertain on I Am King. ... But they're trying, and in a genre that adheres so closely to formula like hardcore, metal, and the spaces in between, that in and of itself means something.\\" Andy Biddulph of Rock Sound described the album as \\"breathtaking\\" and wrote: \\"With its heady mix of head-caving drone, battering hardcore and classic rock riffery, I Am King is a record unlike any other.\\" Critics drew several comparisons between parts or all of I Am King and other metal and hardcore bands, including Converge, Disembodied, The Locust, Melvins, Norma Jean, Refused, Vision of Disorder, and Zao, and noted that the band's heavier music styles on the album included metalcore, death metal and sludge metal. Some critics noted some non-hardcore influences on select tracks, including shoegaze, post-punk and indie rock, and noted similarities to The Smiths and Lush. =Commercial performance= The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at 96, making I Am King the first Code Orange album to appear on a national chart.

It is the author's second novel. His first novel, Rails Under My Back, was published by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux fourteen years earlier in 2000. The publisher described the novel as following: At the heart of this remarkable novel is Thomas Greene Wiggins, a nineteenth-century slave and improbable musical genius who performed under the name Blind Tom. In 1866, Tom and his guardian, Eliza Bethune, struggle to readjust to their fashionable apartment in the City in the aftermath of riots that had driven them away a few years before. But soon a stranger arrives from the mysterious island of Edgemere‚Äîinhabited solely by African settlers and black refugees from the war and riots‚Äîwho intends to reunite Tom with his now-liberated mother. As the novel ranges from Tom's boyhood to the heights of his performing career, the inscrutable savant is buffeted by opportunistic teachers and crooked managers, crackpot healers and militant prophets. In his symphonic novel, Jeffery Renard Allen blends history and fantastical invention to bring to life a radical cipher, a man who profoundly changes all who encounter him.

In his symphonic novel, Jeffery Renard Allen blends history and fantastical invention to bring to life a radical cipher, a man who profoundly changes all who encounter him.'  Origins of the novel  In an essay Allen wrote about the novel and in interviews, he discusses how he began writing The Song of the Shank when he learned of Thomas Wiggins in Oliver Sacks' book An Anthropologist on Mars. Allen started researching Wiggins and working on the novel while he was a fellow at The Dorothy L. and Lewis B. Culllman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. The fellowship began on September 10, 2001, one day before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Allen discusses the terrorist attacks and how they are figured into the novel. He also discusses how his travels on the African continent shaped his creation of a fictional island called Edgemere, a place that is central to the novel's setting and construction of place. As for music, Allen notes that he avoided listening to any recordings of Blind Tom's compositions because he wanted to use his imagination to create his own image of what Tom's music might have sounded like to a listener of Tom's area. On the novel's acknowledgement page, Allen mentions some of the wide-ranging musical influences that shaped his writing, including the Malian singer Oumou Sangar√© and the rock band Tool. About the latter, Allen states in an interview that he was inspired by their unusual songs about physical and spiritual transformations of mind and body. Allen received a support grant from Creative Capital that helped him during many of the years that it took him to write the novel.  Synopsis  Song of the Shank is a novel loosely based on the life of Thomas Greene Wiggins, a nineteenth-century African-American pianist, composer, and performer, who played under the stage name Blind Tom. Born a slave in Columbus, Georgia, in 1849, Tom began giving concert recitals at the age of six and went on to become for several decades one of the most famous Americans of his time. Not only did he play to full houses across the US, the British Isles, and Europe, he was also the first African American to perform at the White House. However, he has for the most part disappeared from history, in part because musicologists have come to view him as an autistic savant who lacked true creative ability. Totaling more than 600 pages, the novel has nine sections in all, each told in third or first person from the point of view of varying central characters, which total seven in all. The present action of the novel covers a period of less than four years, from 1866 until 1869, with flashbacks to the earlier years of Tom's life. When the novel opens, Tom is living in isolation in a Manhattan apartment with his sole guardian, Eliza Bethune, the widow of his former manager who wants to rid herself of Tom. The novel's subsequent sections examine Tom's powerful impact on those who try to return him to fame or who simply want to understand him, including his mother after a decade of separation. In the same way that the novel offers an alternative history of Tom, it also offers an altered history of New York City and America as a whole during the years immediately before the Civil War, the war itself, and the years that followed. These fictive spaces of place and time allow for an imaginative exploration of many subjects, including family, bondage and freedom, religion, and the creative impulse. Critical reception The novel was well received by critics. It was the front-page review for the June 22, 2014, Sunday edition of the New York Times Book Review magazine, where it was reviewed by novelist Mitchell S. Jackson. The Chicago Tribune gave the novel considerable attention, both reviewing the novel and publishing an excerpt of the book in the newspaper. Essence magazine listed it as one of five recommend books for summer reading. Gene Seymour wrote a full-page review of the novel for Bookforum, where he described it as \\"...an eerie fever dream of an historical novel\\". He also wrote, \\"The imaginative artist, especially one such as Allen, who carries the resources of the poet and the psychic in his trick bag.‚Ä¶\\"Gene Seymour, \\"Striking a Chord\\", Bookforum, June/July/August 2014. Booklist gave the novel a starred review where the reviewer wrote: \\"In the extraordinarily talented hands of Allen, Tom is a mysterious and compelling figure, a blind black boy at a time when his perceived infirmities, including his race, should make him insignificant.... [A] tour de force.... A brilliant book, with echoes of Ralph Ellison and William Faulkner.\\" Kirkus Reviews also gave the novel a starred review, with the reviewer writing: \\"Allen's psychological insight and evocative language vividly bring to life all the black and white people in Tom's life who, in seeking to understand or exploit Tom's unholy gifts, are both transformed and transfixed by his inscrutable, resolutely self-contained personality. If there's any justice, Allen's visionary work, as startlingly inventive as one of his subject's performances, should propel him to the front rank of American novelists.\\"\\"Song of the Shank\\" (review), Kirkus, May 15, 2014. In a mixed review that appeared in Publishers Weekly, the reviewer wrote: \\"Both the conception and the underlying history behind this story will leave readers with a profound understanding of the inhumanity of slavery and 19th century racial attitudes. . . . [An] admirable book that invites an important excavation of the past.\\"\\"Song of the Shank\\" (review)], Publishers Weekly, April 7, 2014. The cover of the novel featured a blurb by Junot Diaz, who writes: \\"The prodigiously talented Jeffery Renard Allen is without question one of our most important writers.\\" The novel received additional blurbs on the book and printed and online publicity from a number of distinguished writers, including John Edgar Wideman, Ishmael Reed, and Rene Steinke. Here are the blurbs as listed on the first edition of the book and the author's and publishers websites: \\"One of the miracle books. Also a gift for those of us who love reading and writing---a gift for those not born yet who will learn much about writing and reading, about themselves from Blind Tom\\". - John Edgar Wideman \\"Song of the Shank, for all of its invention, feels like a resurrection of a true past. Jeffery Renard Allen so fully inhabits this imagined history, and so convincingly renders the charisma and mystery of Blind Tom, the story seems as alive and immediate as this very present moment. With his electric and searing prose, with his uncanny insight, Allen has written a spell-binding, masterful novel\\". - Rene Steinke, author of Friendswood \\"Allen‚Äôs novel is an amazing, imagining of another time, place, world\\". - Reginald Gibbons \\"Talent and brilliance are not enough. Writing a novel like this is the equivalent of building a three-story building. Single handedly. Jeffery Renard Allen scores highly with this novel about the life of the nineteenth century savant, BlindTom.\\" - Ishmael Reed References External links *Song of the Shank at Graywolf Press * Kate Tuttle, \\"Jeffery Renard Allen detects alternate history of slave‚Äôs genius\\", The Boston Globe, June 14, 2014. * \\"Command Performance.\\" Mitchell S.

BBC He was best known for his 2000 paintings of angels, created between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1999. He died on October 4, 2012 in Temecula, California. Early life and education Lakey was born in Chateauroux, France. His birth name was Andrew Markivich. He moved to the United States in 1961. After high school, Lakey joined and served in the US Navy and served on the USS Point Defiance LSD-31 in San Diego California. Lakey later donated some of his art works in 2009 to the military charity \\"Cirra's Cloud\\". He had no formal training in art. Career By his late twenties, Lakey was working in auto sales. He became addicted to cocaine, and in 1986 he suffered a near-fatal drug overdose. The next day, he stopped using drugs, and instead began to draw pictures from his experiences. In October 1989, Lakey left his auto sales job to pursue a full-time career as an artist. In January 1990, Lakey experienced a vision in which he saw seven angels. The angels told him that he would have to paint angels, even though he had never picked up a paintbrush in his life.\\"Artist Says Angels Saved Him From Overdose\\" . ABC News Based on this vision, he undertook to create 2000 paintings of angels, one for each year between the birth of Christ and the year 2000. In 1998 author Keith Richardson wrote a book about Lakey's angel project, entitled Andy Lakey's Psychomanteum, published by Ventura Press. Lakey typically used a bas relief technique, where the heavy, mixed media and paint is raised texturally from the canvas surface, This three-dimensionality makes these paintings \\"touchable art.\\" Shortly thereafter, an art critic saw one of his paintings and Lakey became the subject of a story by a local ABC TV affiliate about art for the blind in San Diego. ABC News commentator Peter Jennings of World News Tonight saw a local news story on Lakey‚Äôs art show in aid of the blind, and ran the story nationally; Jennings also requested one of the paintings from the artist, which was donated to the charity Lighthouse For The Blind in New York City. An agent of musician Ray Charles read the ABC news story, and purchased one of Lakey's paintings for Charles. Later, in 2010, Lakey contributed the foreword to the Ray Charles biography, \\"You Don't Know Me: Reflections of My Father, Ray Charles,\\" by Ray Charles (Jr.) Robinson and Mary Jane Ross, in which he further credited Charles‚Äô influence upon his early career. Lakey made donations of early angel paintings to the Blind Children's Center of Los Angeles. Another charity project involved exchanging some of his angel drawings for thousands of letters from children in the Murrieta school system pledging to live a drug-free life. Lakey's works are in thousands of private collections,\\" Painter's Work Is Touched by an Angel\\" . By Gloria Goodale, Arts and culture correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor, August 14, 1998 including those of Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Pope John Paul II, Ed Asner, Kelsey Grammer, Jimmy Carter, Gerald and Betty Ford, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco. In 1998 Lakey completed the 2000 angel paintings, producing the last two works during 1999 in which Angel #2000 (an assemblage 20 feet by 10 feet in size, composed of 200 12‚Äù square paintings) was a montage of many smaller angels. He signed the final Angel at a public event in San Francisco, California, on New Year's Eve 2000.\\"Andy Lakey's angel paintings offer visual and tactile access to another world.\\". Monterey County Weekly, July 30, 1998. In 1996, Lakey and Paul R. Walker published a book containing reproductions of 100 of his paintings.\\"Andy Lakey: Art, Angels, and Miracles.\\" . Booklist Review, June 1, 1996 In 1999, Lakey developed chronic health issues from overexposure to the toxins in his paint, resulting in multiple surgeries. He took a hiatus from his painting and began to work in video, as the subject of a video diary series shot in his studio. After 2000, Lakey continued to work in mixed media on wood and also painted other collections; \\"One Heart,\\" a collection of heart paintings, \\"Silhouettes And Shadows,\\" special portraits and commissions using tracings of the heads and hands of his collectors, Abstracts (also known as the \\"Energy Paintings\\"), and flora and fauna color studies titled \\"Brilliant Nature\\". In 2005, an 11-minute short art film \\"Silhouettes & Shadows\\", focusing on the textures in Lakey's abstract works, was independently produced by filmmaker Doug Brown. In 2006, his artwork was on display at a local gallery. In May 2010, still under doctors‚Äô supervision, Lakey began a new cycle of two-thousand Golden Angels, using 22-karat gold leaf applied to mixed media surfaces, and helped to launch a website featuring his Angel paintings. The onset of hand tremors led him to simplify his style, developing an increasingly \\"minimalist\\" technique. In 2011-2012 he used this technique to produce a series titled \\"The Studies and Paintings\\". Lakey continued to paint, but wore protective gear for health reasons. On October 3, 2012, Lakey died due to complications after suffering a seizure. Lakey‚Äôs personal story and artistic career have been covered on nationally televised syndicated and broadcast network programs, including ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorld News Tonight‚Äù and ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù, NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Today Show‚Äù, CNN, Fox News, ‚ÄúInside Edition‚Äù, ‚ÄúHard Copy‚Äù.

Presently there are more than 30 active stations worldwide. Gravity anchored frame for Argus cameras An Argus station usually consists of 3-6 synchronized cameras that cover a stretch of beach up to 5 kilometers (3 statute miles) centered at the station. Cameras are typically mounted on a tall building or other structure. Argus imagery can be used to determine shorelines, bathymetries, wave period and direction, and long-shore surface currents. Not all measurements are possible in all conditions. The major advantage of Argus is its long-term presence on the coast. Some sites have been collecting data for almost 20 years. Argus imagery can also be integrated with other data sources (e.g., offshore buoys for wave amplitude) and numerical models to provide near-term predictions. One application under development is identifying dangers from rip channels to improved swimmer safety.

The role was originated by Justin Gaston in 2014, as Ben Rogers, when the character was introduced as the new love interest of Abigail Deveraux (Kate Mansi), and was later revealed to be the estranged brother of Jordan Ridgeway (Chrishell Stause). Soon after, Wilson was hired as a recast and the writers began exploring the character's dark past with the introduction of his abusive criminal father Clyde Weston (James Read). In 2015, the romantic triangle between Ben, Abigail and Chad DiMera (Billy Flynn) culminates in Ben becoming a serial killer, known as the \\"Necktie Killer,\\" claiming several victims, including legacy character Will Horton (Guy Wilson). Wilson vacated the role in late 2015 and would reprise the role for multiple guest stints. In 2016, he returned to the role to help facilitate the departure of Mansi as Abigail. Wilson returned again in 2017 when Will was reintroduced with former cast member Chandler Massey in the role. Wilson made a one-episode guest appearance on May 4, 2018, and returned to the show as a series regular on June 1 of the same year. Upon his return, head writer Ron Carlivati began to redeem the character through his friendship and relationship with Ciara Brady (Victoria Konefal). Storylines Ben (Justin Gaston) comes to Salem in 2014 where he lands a job as a waiter at Club TBD and runs into his estranged sister Jordan Ridgeway. Ben is immediately smitten with Abigail while Jordan tries to chase Ben out of town fearing someone will uncover their past but he calms her fears. Jordan tries to chase Ben out of town fearing someone will uncover their past but Ben is too smitten with Abigail Deveraux to care. Ben and Jordan are horrified when their abusive father Clyde comes to town demanding the money they stole from him. Ben is surprised when Clyde changes his tune and gives Jordan back her life's savings. Meanwhile, Ben grows closer to Abby despite her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera attempts to sabotage his budding romance with Abigail and the life he's building in Salem. Ben gets himself arrested when he attacks Chad in public after Chad throws his sexual relationships with Abby and Jordan in his face. Clyde reveals that the DiMeras bribed the casino manager to testify against Ben. However, the witness is found dead and charges are dropped. Ben is suspicious when Chad helps Abby get her job back at the hospital and Ben in turn convinces her to move in with him. Ben follows Abigail to the DiMera mansion where he finds Abigail has slept with Chad. Instead of confronting her, Ben proposes to Abigail after Clyde gifts him with his late mother's engagement ring. Ben is even more excited to learn that Abby is pregnant. As they begin planning their wedding, Clyde offers to buy the couple a house as wedding gift. Meanwhile, Ben warns Abigail to keep her distance from Chad who has been implicated in the murders of Serena Mason (Melissa Archer) and Paige Larson (True O'Brien). Realizing Abigail can't stay away from Chad, Ben convinces her to leave town with him after the wedding. The killer then attacks Doctor Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall) and Chad \\"interrupts\\" the confrontation. When Chad goes on the run, Ben changes his mind about moving. On September 24, 2015, Ben is revealed to be \\"The Necktie Killer\\" when he is shown dumping evidence into the river. Ben ask Abigail's cousin Will Horton (Guy Wilson) to be the best man at their wedding. Meanwhile, Ben is furious when his future brother-in-law JJ Deveraux (Casey Moss) gets Clyde arrested for drug trafficking and they nearly come to blows. In October 2015, Ben claims another victim when he strangles Will to death as Will has discovered Ben is the killer. Ben once again, frames Chad for the murder. Chad realizes Ben is the killer and confronts him but Ben beats him into a coma. Ben claims that Chad broke in and attacked him because he is obsessed with Abby. As Clyde is extradited, Ben confesses to the killings and Clyde promises to keep his secret. Ben takes Abby to a secluded where she goes into premature labor. Ben calls a midwife Wendy (Denice Duff), to help Abigail deliver the baby. After the birth, Ben shoots Wendy and buries her in the woods. Chad comes to Abby's rescue but Ben ties them up together, sets the cabin on fire and runs off with the baby whom Ben has named Colin. However, Ben is apprehended by JJ and Lani Price (Sal Stowers) and taken back to Salem. When Chad and Abigail confront him, Ben has seemingly lost his grip on reality. Despite his condition, Ben tells Abby where he left the baby and he is then put on a 24-hour suicide watch and taken to jail. In April 2016, Ben breaks into the DiMera mansion and he is shocked when Abigail professes her love for him. When Ben lets his guard down, Abigail stabs him and knocks him out. Ben wakes up tied to the bed and a deranged Abigail sets him on fire. Chad arrives just in time to put the fire out but Ben's legs are severely burned. The police take Ben into custody and district attorney Justin Kiriakis (Wally Kurth) concludes that Ben was sane enough to escape the hospital, and Ben is sent to prison instead of back to the mental hospital. In September 2017, Ben crashes Chad and Abigail's double wedding with Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith) and Paul Narita (Christopher Sean) to announce that Sonny's husband Will (Chandler Massey) is still alive. Ben tells Marlena that Clyde told him Will is alive. Later, Will's mother Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) convinces Ben to reenact Will's \\"murder\\" to cure his amnesia. However, Ben can't bring himself to hurt Will again and Sami has him locked away again. In June 2018, Marlena visits Ben and questions his mental state as he is due to be released from the sanitarium. Ben says it was the incident with Sami and Will that caused his break through. Ben promises to make amends for the pain he caused. Upon release, Ben visits Will to apologize and Chad orders him out of town. When Chad ditches him at the edge of town, Ben finds Ciara Brady (Victoria Konefal) after a motorcycle crash. Ben promises he has changed and convinces her to let him tend to her wounds. They bond as Ben cares for her and she begins to trust him. However, Ben unravels when he can't fill his medication due to the Salem police putting out an APB on him and Ciara. Paranoid Ben suffers from hallucinations of Clyde who tries to convince him that Ciara turned him in. Ciara talks him down and Ben goes to the pharmacy to get his medication only to return to Ciara's police commissioner mother, Hope (Kristian Alfonso) and Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering) rescue Ciara from the burning cabin. Ben is arrested for arson but swears he is innocent and Ciara hires Ted Laurent (Gilles Marini) as his attorney. After his release, Ben is attacked by Paige's mother Eve Donovan (Kassie DePaiva) and turns to Ciara for help. After the police rule the fire was an accident, Hope agrees to drop the charges if Ben skips town. However, Ciara invites Ben to move in with her, her boyfriend Tripp Dalton (Lucas Adams) and her niece Claire (Olivia Rose Keegan). Ben was arrested after Tripp planted evidence against him. He was then let go, He soon learned the truth and informed Ciara about it. He chose not to press charges against Tripp. He starts dating newly single Ciara. He also saves her from the burning fire after his sister Jordan Ridgeway abducts her. Ben takes Ciara to the hospital where Ciara is admitted for inhaling too much smoke. Jordan shows up in Ciara's room and knocks Ben out. When he regains his consciousness, he stops Jordan from hurting Ciara, he almost kills her with a syringe but is stopped by Rafe Hernandez. Feeling guilty for almost hurting the sister who raised him, he visits her at the police station and apologizes to her. He then figures out that it was Claire Brady who set both the fires at the Mammoth Falls Cabin and the Horton cabin that almost killed Ciara, Tripp and Haley Chen. He saves Tripp and Haley, but gets wrongly accused of setting the fire and gets arrested. At the SPD, he confides in Ciara and they secretly conspire against Claire. Looking for work he meets garage mechanic, Jake Lambert, who looks exactly like his deceased friend and former boss, Stefan DiMera. Jake hires him. With a source of income, he feels he can propose to Ciara. They are married by Julie with many in attendance. As they walk the church aisle to leave, an explosive goes off injuring many and burying Ben under debris. Emergency, fire and police responders are unable to find Ben.

Eve is still grieving the murder of her daughter, Paige, at the hands of Ben. She and Vincent torture and brainwash Ben with mind-altering drugs. They program him to kill Ciara. He is found by Ciara and Hope. Development =Casting and creation= Justin Gaston originated the role of Ben Rogers on February 26, 2014. In the summer of 2013 Soap Opera Digest reported that the soap had put out two separate casting calls, one of which was for the role of Ben. In February 2014, it was reported that actor and country singer Justin Gaston, known for his appearance on the television series, Nashville Star had been cast in the contract role of Ben. Gaston filmed his first scenes in October 2013 and was slated to make his first appearance on February 26, 2014. During the week of April 7, 2014, rumors circulated that Gaston had been replaced by actor Robert Scott Wilson, with neither actor nor the show commented on the speculation. On April 14, 2014, Soap Opera Digest confirmed the rumor and reported that Gaston was indeed replaced by Wilson, known for being the first male model on The Price Is Right and his portrayal of Peter Cortlandt in the short-lived online reboot of the ABC soap, All My Children. Wilson commented on the news that he would soon depart from the game show, and thanked fans. The following day, Wilson confirmed his final appearance on The Price is Right as April 15, and assured fans that he was not leaving on bad terms but did not comment on his new gig at Days of Our Lives. Wilson made his debut on May 22, 2014. At the time, Wilson was testing for another project on Fox. When the project fell through, Wilson returned to Boston to visit his family for Christmas which is when he learned he got the job. \\"It came at a time when I didn't expect,\\" Wilson told Soap Opera Digest. Ironically, Wilson had just purchased a brand new Mercedes Benz the week before booking the gig. \\"Fortune favors the bold\\" he said of his luck. He started filming on January 8, 2014, and had filmed twelve episodes by the end of February. Wilson accredited his landing the role to his time on All My Children and his former costar Jill Larson. Wilson also found common ground with former AMC alum, Chrishell Stause who played Ben's sister, Jordan and said Stause and [Kate] Mansi helped him make the transition. After landing the gig, Wilson learned he would also be working opposite [Kristian] Alfonso, another Boston native. =Characterization=  Personality  The original casting call described Ben as being in his early to mid 20s, a ‚Äúgorgeous, Caucasian, country boy.‚Äù He is supposed to be Midwestern or Southern. The casting notice also described Ben as ‚Äúutterly charming‚Äù due to his ‚Äúhonest sincere approach to life and love.‚Äù The producers looked for actors with a musical background. According to Soap Central, musical talent was not a requirement for those auditioning for the role. Ben was also said to have a \\"slight southern accent.\\" Wilson described the character as being \\"a little more generic in the beginning.\\" \\"He's kind of a loner. He's traveled and can read people very well.\\" However, Ben can be a bit unpredictable, and according to Wilson, \\"he's a loose cannon.\\" Ben has a lot of rage because he comes from a \\"messed-up home.\\" Wilson described Ben as a \\"good guy\\" who isn't afraid to \\"put somebody in line if he has to.\\" Unlike his former role as Pete, \\"With Ben, I'm playing more of a hungry person.\\" Wilson further described Ben as \\"very street-smart\\" and the typical \\"nice guy.\\" However, he can be a protective of his loved ones. In an interview with On-Air On-Soaps, Wilson explained that Ben has a \\"temper\\" that can get him into trouble. Ben has a \\"protective nature\\" because of his past.  Backstory  Wilson later admitted that he didn't know much about the character when he assumed the role of Ben. \\"[The producers] really only gave me what I needed to know to make it real and understandable to me.\\" Wilson revealed that the producers gave him a lot \\"creative control\\" when it came to his character's backstory. Wilson revealed that he and Ben share a similar background because he too comes \\"from humble beginnings.\\" Ben is born Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Weston on March 13, 1989 in the small city of Poplar Bluff, Missouri. Wilson stated, \\"Ben has pretty much always been broke\\" and he's never experienced any real \\"stability in his life.\\" \\"I had to come up with my own backstory for things to work for me as the story went further\\" the actor explained. Wilson said of his character that \\"Ben has lived a crazy life. Ben hopes to make a home for himself by settling in the same town as his sister Jordan. Though Ben is the younger of the siblings, he has \\"stepped up\\" for Jordan and tries to be a father figure for her and protect her as payback for her raising him. However, Ben's plans are threatened by the arrival of his father, Clyde Weston. Ben \\"very wary of Clyde\\" because he only has bad memories of him. While Clyde and Ben want the same thing, to build a father-son relationship, Clyde's schemes constantly undermines any progress they make. = Relationship with Abigail = The character is paired with Abigail Deveraux in a romantic storyline. Wilson explained that Abigail is the first girl to make Ben want to \\"settle down\\" and have a stable relationship. \\"It's all really new to him.\\" Ben's secret past jeopardizes his budding romance with Abigail because \\"He's not yet ready to tell her... but if everything is good at the end of the tunnel\\" Ben will come clean. Wilson formed a close bond with his costar Mansi which he said helped with their onscreen chemistry. Ben doesn't hold Abigail's past against her because \\"Everybody's got baggage\\" Wilson said. Ben can understand and identity with Abby having a trouble past \\"because he's far from perfect himself.\\" Abby and Ben's new romance is also threatened by return of her ex-boyfriend Chad DiMera. Abigail is forced to choose between staying faithful to Ben and protecting him from a potential prison stint when he gets arrested for assaulting Chad. After an affair with Chad, which Ben witnesses, Abigail ends up pregnant and is unsure of her baby's paternity. Ben is so desperate to make a better life for himself that he willingly overlooks Abigail's cheating. \\"That's always in the back of Ben's head\\" Wilson stated. So, Ben is faced with the task of burying those feelings and staying focused on \\"his ultimate goal of having a family and becoming stable.\\" He continued, \\"Abigail is the puzzle piece that will make all of that possible.\\" Wilson further stated that this is the first relationship where Ben has \\"found something to invest in\\" and he is afraid to lose that so when he learns she is pregnant, Ben holds on tighter. However, \\"it's eating him alive\\" Wilson said of Abigail seemingly being drawn to Chad. But, he finds comfort in Abby's reassurances which keep him grounded in the \\"reality that he knows.\\" Wilson said he'd advise his character to leave Abigail and the town of Salem behind but admitted \\"Love makes you do wild stuff.\\" =The Necktie killer (2015)= In April 2015, during an interview for Soapcentral.com, Wilson said that viewers will \\"learn more about Ben in the next six months.\\" The actor continued, \\"It's a whole other side of Ben, and I'm really excited to kind of unravel it.\\" Wilson welcomed the shift in the direction of his character. \\"I was getting bored out of my mind. So thank God. It's time for the cycle to change.\\" Wilson admitted that Ben develops \\"more of a wild streak than ever.\\" In the summer of 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that the series would launch a Murder mystery plot in late August as the show was to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The plot would feature several characters, including some fan favorites as victims. The story was slated to climax during the week of November 8, 2015, the official anniversary date. On the episode which aired on September 24, 2015, the episode culminates with the revelation that Wilson's Ben is the mysterious Necktie Killer when he is shown going over the evidence. Wilson was invited to a meeting with executive producer Albert Alarr and then headwriter Josh Griffith where they informed him of the plans for Ben. Wilson was immediately excited about the story. In 2018, Wilson said of the story, \\"I didn‚Äôt see it as a door closing. I saw it as a way to stretch as an actor.\\" But, Wilson initially felt some apprehension about the decision. \\"They either want me to fail‚Ä¶ or they trust me.\\" But the producers quickly assured the actor it was the latter. And once he got into it, Wilson felt the changes allowed for him to play the role more \\"honestly.\\" Wilson admitted that the way he worked changed \\"Because they were writing for me. They wrote me an amazing story, which ended up being the threat of the entire show. They trusted me with it.\\" In an interview with Soapcentral.com, Wilson said \\"I got to really know Ben and attack him and play it out to its fullest. I'm grateful they wrote as much as they did and really took the time on the story. They put a lot of care into it, and we all stepped up.\\" Wilson described the plot twist as \\"some of the most fulfilling work of my career.\\" He said of the character change, \\"It's really night and day\\" from the Ben viewers had come to know. Wilson relished in portraying the \\"bad guy.\\" The actor was very grateful because \\"they really did write for Ben\\" and that allowed him to take a lot of \\"chances and risks.\\" He continued, \\"I played things that I had never done.\\" In an interview with Michael Fairman from On- Air On-Soaps, Wilson revealed that when the story started filming, even he was not aware that Ben was the killer. Ben dumps the evidence in the river believing he has covered his tracks. The scenes were filmed in one take and Wilson later revealed that he wanted to re-shoot the scenes because he knew the fans wouldn't miss a beat and would notice that there was air in the bag ‚Äì which would keep it from sinking. Ben is able to \\"keep his game face on\\" in public, until he is alone and \\"can kind of revel in what has happened.\\" In private, Ben takes \\"deep breathes, and try to regain his composure.\\" Victims The killer's first victim is Serena Mason, played by Melissa Archer, who had recently announced her departure from the series. Serena is found strangled to death and Chad is implicated as a suspect because of their drunken confrontation the night before. Less than a month later, the killer claims another victim when Paige Larson (True O'Brien) is strangled to death with a red necktie. Chad once again appears to be the prime suspect as he had been harassing Paige who had witnessed the altercation with Serena. Following Paige's murder, there was immediate speculation that Ben was framing Chad or that Clyde had framed Chad on Ben's behalf. On the episode that aired on September 24, 2015, the killer tries and fails to kill one of the show's most iconic characters, Marlena Evans, portrayed by veteran actress Deidre Hall. Wilson later admitted that he wasn't too enthused about Ben's choice of victims, specifically O'Brien's character. \\"That one got me the most because True is so young\\" Wilson explained. During the interview with Fairman, Wilson confirmed that Ben would take more lives. \\"There is a lot more to this story\\" he teased. \\"The body count will rise\\" he declared. On the episode which aired on October 9, 2015, Ben would claim a third, and most significant victim ‚Äì Will Horton (Guy Wilson) as he discovers Ben is the killer. Until Will, Ben is \\"somebody who doesn't know what he's doing.\\" It is Will's death that forces Ben to face the reality of his actions. Before the episode aired, Wilson identified Will's murder as the turning point for Ben: \\"That‚Äôs the full change for him. When that happens, then he will be aware of everything that is happening in real time, rather than playing this game where he is thinking he is doing something right, when it‚Äôs not.\\"  Motives and psychosis  The reveal episode also featured scenes in which Ben changes his mind about leaving town with Abigail when he learns there is an APB out for Chad. Ben feels a sense of \\"closure\\" hinting at his motives. According to Wilson, Ben's actions stem from love, \\"as tragic as it all is. It's done out of love, but unfortunately he is going insane.\\" Ben who has \\"constantly\\" buried his feelings about Abigail's betrayal has reached the end of his rope. Dealing with Abigail's betrayal is such a new experience for Ben because he's never really had anything to lose. \\"Everything Ben does is to set Chad up\\" Wilson stated. Ben never intends to hurt anyone. Ben sees his victims as \\"chess pieces\\" in a much bigger game ‚Äì they will help him hold onto the life he has made for himself. As far as Ben is concerned, he is doing the \\"right thing.\\" The writers took it a step further in the development of the story by portraying Ben as having suffered some sort of psychological break creating two distinct personalities for himself. The Ben viewers meet in 2014 is the \\"nice guy\\" who is just a bartender and Abigail's boyfriend. He \\"takes the hand of the little princess [Abigail] of Salem.\\" But then, there is \\"Benjamin\\" who experiences \\"blackouts\\" and blames Chad for his behavior. From Ben's perspective, Chad is responsible for the murders. Though Wilson insisted that Ben does not have a split personality, \\"Benjamin is another part of Ben's personality that acted as his protector.\\" To help prepare for his portrayal of Ben, Wilson did some research with similar characters. He studied Anthony Perkins portrayal of Norman Bates in the 1960 film Psycho as well as Edward Norton's character in the 1996 film Primal Fear ‚Äì who deals with a split personality. Wilson also watched several documentaries about the lives of serial killers. \\"If somebody were to see my Netflix queue during that time they probably would have asked, 'What's up with this guy?'\\" he said jokingly. However, in his research, Wilson recognized that Ben becoming a killer was entirely possible. \\"The writers tapped into Ben's childhood, when he suffered abuse. That was the place where a lot of evil was rooted.\\" Tapping into that part of his psyche, \\"worked for me as an actor\\" Wilson explained. \\"It is truly a great experience to go through as an actor, and weird at the same time.\\" = Departure (2015) = While he was initially excited about the storyline, Wilson knew there was a strong possibility that once the story wrapped, he could be out of a job. As the serial killer story was set to climax in the fall, Soaps SheKnows reported that Wilson would likely vacate the role of Ben Weston when the story wrapped. However, neither Wilson nor the producers would comment on the actor's status with the series. Wilson intentionally played coy during another interview in November 2015. When asked if he was coming or going, the actor \\"It's a little bit of both. Maybe he's gone and then he's back and then he's gone. Maybe he's just among us. Maybe he's something that you can't get rid of.\\" Wilson seemingly vacated the role on December 8, 2015, when Ben goes to prison. By the time of his departure, Wilson felt that Ben had completed his arc. Despite reports that Wilson was done with the series, the actor continued posting pictures on social media of himself on the set. = Returns (2016‚Äì2017) = In January 2016 it was announced that Wilson would reprise his role as Ben. The actor reappeared onscreen on March 11. Wilson revealed that Albert Alarr informed him toward the end of his first arc of the plans to bring the character back. However, this is a \\"new chapter\\" for Ben. \\"This is now a fresh arc for myself and what I make for Ben.\\" According to Wilson, Ben returns because he misses Salem, having found a home for himself there and \\"because he wants to know what's going on\\" and he somehow sees beyond what he has done. As Abigail prepares to marry Chad, it is reported that Ben has escaped the mental hospital. However, when Abby sees Ben at her wedding, he appears to be a figment of her imagination. Chad and JJ orchestrate a plan to lure Ben out of hiding, using Abigail as bait. However, Abigail's hallucinations get worse as the possibility that Ben is looming becomes even more real. During the week of April 11, 2016, Ben and Abigail come face to face. \\"It's the real deal and not a figment of Abigail's imagination\\" Wilson confirmed. At that point, it is a game of cat and mouse. The confrontation culminates with Ben to a bed and Abigail setting him on fire, as he had previously done to her and Chad. Wilson's costar Kate Mansi told Soap Opera Digest about filming the scenes. \\"From the minute we arrived on set, Robert and I felt the weight of that encounter\\" the actress explained. The actors didn't even rehearse together as usual. The taping was delayed due to a lighting problem so they took advantage of the downtime and \\"We didn't take our eyes off each other\\" allowing for the tension to build. The actors then utilized the remainder of the time to run through their scenes, without any dialogue. When the lighting situation was fixed, \\"Robert and I just let ourselves get out of the way and went for the ride without any hesitation.\\" Wilson concluded his run with the series on June 24, 2016. The return also helped facilitate Kate Mansi's departure from the series. \\"I'm so grateful to have been a part of her last episode\\" Wilson said. In September 2017, it was announced the Wilson was set to reprise his role in late September, under new head writer Ron Carlivati. Wilson was very enthusiastic about the return. \\"I couldn't have asked for a better entrance back to Salem ‚Äì when no one sees it coming.\\" Just about everyone in town has converged on the church for a double wedding \\"and then I got to swing the church doors open and drop a bomb\\" the actor explained to Soap Opera Digest. Ben announces to a packed room that Will Horton is alive upsetting the event. For Ben, this is \\"great news.\\" Ben considered Will to be a friend so \\"Ben is trying to clear his conscience, and hopefully, clear his name as well.\\" However, Ben has more than one agenda and sees it as a chance to stick it to those who have wronged him because he blames the people of Salem for turning him into what he has become. Ben takes pleasure in taunting everyone about Will being alive, which upsets Will's closest relatives. However, Ben cannot produce Will. \\"That's part of the mystery. He's hoping Will can be found.\\" Wilson was contacted in the spring of 2017 about returning to the series. The producers told him a little bit about the story, stating: \\"It sounded like really great stuff, and they were correct. I had a blast.\\" While he was welcomed back, a lot had changed with the serial. \\"In a short amount of time, they really spread Ben out, and he interacts with a lot of different characters,\\" Wilson said, while also stating he was definitely open to another return in the future. Wilson wrapped his stint on November 30, 2017, when Ben is sent back to the mental institution. = Reintroduction and redemption = In January 2018, Wilson revealed that he had visited the set which led to rumors of another return. Later, actress Denice Duff announced that she would also reprise her role as midwife Wendy Taylor, which fueled speculation. Soaps.com stated that Duff would reappear alongside Wilson in May 2018. On April 26, 2018, Soap Opera Digest announced that Wilson signed a new contract and would return as a series regular. \\"I'm really grateful,\\" Wilson said to in a statement to the magazine. \\"I love what Ron [Carlivati, head writer] and the whole team has been doing with him thus far, so I'm really excited to see where they take him after this.\\" Wilson credited his co-star Deidre Hall (Marlena) with being partly responsible for his return. \\"She kind of rallied for me be back there\\" he said. \\"After our scenes, she'd say, 'Get this kid a contract.'\\" Wilson said \\"You can get caught in that stagnant place on shows sometimes and it's nice to come back and revamp a storyline or maybe create something new and just be inspired. We've got a good thing going, so I think that's why I'll be sticking around a little bit longer.\\" Wilson saw the return as a chance to grow the character as well as \\"work my own instrument a little bit more.\\" While there would obviously be opposition from other characters on the canvas, \\"there's also maybe some people that can hear his side of the story now and might believe in [Ben] a little bit more.\\" In an article for Soap Hub, Janet Di Lauro questioned exactly how the character could be integrated into the canvas, despite his past. \\"It's time for a magical rewrite or convoluted explanation,\\" she said. In an interview with Michael Maloney for TV Insider, Wilson said \\"The show has come up with a phenomenal way to bring Ben full circle and putting him in a different light without losing his edge. They're writing the balance between vulnerability and danger.\\" Wilson said to Soap Hub that maintaining the character's edge is the \\"trough line for everything.\\" The writing leaves one wondering if, \\"at any moment\\" could Ben \\"slip back into that dangerous mental space.\\" The writers paired Wilson with Deidre Hall's character, resident shrink, Marlena Evans, as she examines his mental stability upon hearing the news that he is rehabilitated. Laurisa from Soapcentral.com argued that the extreme circumstances of the parallel plot in which Abigail avoided prison after killing someone due to a psychotic break made Ben's return more plausible. \\"A psychiatrist has deemed him sane, which the show can't shoot down in a light of Abigail's storyline.\\" Wilson described Marlena as the \\"gatekeeper to get Ben back into the world of Salem.\\" Of Ben's state of mind, Wilson said \\"He had a chance to find himself, do some heavy reading and find God, maybe. He is medicated. He has been cleared and deemed sane. And he's okay.\\" Wilson revealed that Ben would interact with many of the characters he shared history with in addition to new faces. One of those new faces would be Victoria Konefal who played legacy character Ciara Brady. \\"Well he needs somebody to support him\\" the actor stated. Even with support from Marlena and Ciara, \\"it's a struggle for him\\" Wilson stated. Ben chooses to return to Salem \\"because he wants to make amends.‚Ä¶ And not everybody wants that.\\" Ben is \\"developing a sense of worth.\\" In an interview with the Boston Herald, Wilson said Ben is \\"trying to be a better person. It's going to get uglier before it gets prettier, and that's my favorite part.\\" Wilson appreciated that the pacing: \\"They've done a great job telling this story, of not rushing it or brushing anything under the rug. There isn't an easy road to redemption, and this audience will see the struggle for Ben to prove himself.\\" Within 2 months, Janet Di Lauro said the show had successfully made Ben an \\"anti-hero\\" with three plot points: \\"Marlena's blessing,\\" his saving Ciara's life, and most significantly, Ben keeping his distance from Abigail. \\"The old Ben would have been on her doorstep wreaking havoc immediately. The new Ben has clearly moved on, because he is a healed man, and one DAYS has somehow transformed into an anti-hero.\\" Reception = General = In response to the original casting call looking for attractive actors, Luke Kerr said, \\"Finding beautiful actors is all well and good, but please make sure they can act before letting them sign on the dotted line. \\" On-Air On-Soaps said \\"Gaston fits the bill perfectly\\" considering his musical background. In response to the recast, Omar Nobles of TVSource Magazine said, \\"I am THRILLED with this news.\\" He continued and praised Wilson for his charm and charisma. Nobles stated, \\"I rank this recast as an instant UPGRADE.\\"/ Wilson ranked at #10 on Daytime Confidential's list of the \\"10 Best Soap Newbies of 2013\\" having recently wrapped short lived stint on All My Children. Wilson's appearance on the list was only days after he had secretly booked the role of Ben. Wilson also ranked at #3 on the soap blog's list of the \\"10 Daytime Soap Opera Hunks We'd Love to Take Underwear Shopping.\\" Jamey Giddens said, \\"Is it any wonder CBS Daytime decided to make Robert Scott Wilson the first-ever male model on The Price is Right? Since then, the gorgeous hunk has proven to have impressive chops on two daytime soaps.\\" Despite Wilson being a popular casting choice, the writing for his character was very poorly received. Daytime Confidential listed the exploration of the character's backstory at #2 in its list of the \\"10 Worst Soap Opera Storylines of 2014.\\" The blog admitted that had the actors (including Wilson's costars Chrishell Stause and James Read) been cast in a more established roles, \\"we doubt they'd be on a worst list.\\" The site specifically said he should have been cast in the role of Andrew Donovan, son of supercouple Shane and Kimberly (Charles Shaughnessy and Patsy Pease) and brother to Theresa Donovan (Jen Lilley). On the character's love triangle with Abigail and Chad, Giddens said it \\"isn't exactly compelling\\" and he also reiterated that the character of Andrew Donovan would've been better for story purposes. = Serial killer = While the character was initially not well received, the shocking serial killer plot and Wilson's portrayal led to Ben becoming a fan favorite. One blog christened the character with the nickname \\"Batty Ben\\" while TVSource Magazine hailed Ben as \\"The sexiest serial killer in soap history.\\" Wilson received critical acclaim in the soap press and many were quite surprised the actor did not receive Daytime Emmy Award nomination for his work. However, Ben's multiple return stints garnered the series multiple daytime Emmy nominations, and wins, including the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2018. The Boston Herald also praised Wilson for \\"bringing vulnerability, remorse and a bit of mystery\\" to Ben during his redemption plot in 2018. Michael Maloney described becoming a soap serial killer as \\"a thankless role\\" but credited Wilson's \\"compelling performances\\" with garnering \\"rave reviews.\\" Jamey Giddens of Daytime Confidential initially praised the serial killer storyline and said \\"The latest in a long line of DAYS serial killers is giving the show back its life\\" by getting rid of the \\"nonessential characters\\" like Serena and Paige. \\"Praise Soap Jesus\\" Giddens exclaimed. Ironically, Giddens hoped the killer's next victims would be Ben and Clyde Weston. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the scenes in which Ben was revealed to be the serial killer. Soap Central's Kambra Clifford described the plot twist as \\"hellish\\" and \\"devilishly dark.\\" Soap Shows described Wilson's official confirmation of Ben as the serial killer as a \\"spoilers reveal like no other.\\" Soap Shows christened the character with the nickname \\"Batty Ben\\" and said \\"he's become the creepiest Salem man around.\\" The blog further commented that \\"Robert Scott Wilson appears to be having a blast playing an on-the-edge psycho who could flip at any moment.\\" Donald of Canyon News said the storyline and character reignited his interest in the soap. Wilson \\"played Ben with devious perfection.\\" Initially, many viewers responded on social media and message boards in denial as many refused to believe that Ben was the killer. However, Ben's third victim in Will Horton would stir up quite a bit of controversy with many questioning the decision to kill off such an important character. Michael Fairman described the fans as having \\"mixed-emotions\\" on social media. Viewer emotions over Will's murder ranged from \\"utterly shocked and heartbroken\\" to \\"outraged.\\" Some viewers described the character's death as \\"unnecessary\\" while others \\"could not stop crying\\" and others believed the character \\"deserved better\\" and the decision made some \\"sick.\\" Days superstar Alison Sweeney who played Will's mother Sami even voiced her own anger over the decision to kill the character. Hope Campbell commented on the manner in which Will died at Ben's hands: \\"Will was an integral part of the show, and we watched him die in a horrific manner from his own point of view.\\" Campbell praised the production of the scenes and said \\"seeing the screen fade to black as Will faded with his last breath sent chills up our spines and not something we remember seeing often on a soap.\\" However, she described the situation as \\"over-the-top\\" and said the manner in which Ben transported the corpse \\"added another layer of creepiness we were not looking for.\\" Despite the controversy that stemmed from Will's murder, Wilson received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Ben. Michael Fairman who praised the story as a \\"deeply affection and riveting arc\\" said \\"Wilson owned every second of Ben's troubled inner life and turmoil.\\" Soap Opera Digest made the climax it's \\"Editor's Choice\\" and praised Wilson and his co-stars for making the \\"stakes feel higher\\" and \\"infusing the action with blistering intensity.\\" The magazine said \\"Wilson was mesmerizing as his character slipped in and out of lucidity. Wilson expertly highlighted Ben's struggle to stay cognizant as the manic part of his personality threatened complete dominance.\\" On-Air On-Soaps deemed the plot twist as the \\"Most Shocking Storyline\\" for the year 2015. The website also praised Ben as the \\"Most Revived Character\\" and Wilson as one of the \\"Best\\" supporting actors. Soap Opera Digest further praised the character's \\"revitalization\\" describing Ben as a \\"ho-hum character whose appeal increased as Wilson plumbed the depths of his alter ego's insanity.\\" Hope Campbell of Soap Hub noted that some fans suspected Ben had been faking his break from reality. Wilson's omission from the Daytime Emmy pre-nominations invoked a strong outcry from fans on social media. On-Air On- Soaps said Wilson's omission from the nominees was one of the more noticeable ones. Fame10 included Wilson on its 2016 list of \\"Most Shocking Soap Opera Emmy Snubs.\\" Dorathy Gass declared Wilson's omission was \\"sheer craziness!\\" She hoped Wilson would get the well-deserved the Supporting Actor nomination in 2017. Hollie Deese of Soaps.com said Wilson's exclusion was a \\"glaring oversight\\" because \\"I think he took it all this year, hands down.\\" Deese hailed Wilson as one of the \\"top young actors in the genre.\\" = Return stints = Hope Campbell of Soap Hub said Wilson's 2016 return would surely \\"shake things up\\" just in time for February Sweeps. Michael Fairman praised Wilson for his \\"incredibly twisted\\" portrayal during Ben's final confrontation with Kate Mansi's Abigail in April 2015. Michael Goldberg from Serial Scoop said the scenes were \\"magnificent.\\" Despite Ben terrorizing Abigail, \\"to many fans, Ben was a treat.\\" Hope Campbell said Wilson's performance kept viewers \\"enthralled\\" during his return. In a sample poll of nearly 2,000 votes, 65% of viewers hoped the character would return. A Gold Derby poll saw 56% of voters were excited for Ben's return. When Wilson reprised his role in 2017, Ryan White-Nobles excitedly declared \\"The sexiest serial killer in soap history is returning to Days of our Lives!\\" \\"If Will is returning to Salem, it should only make sense that the man who 'killed' him does, too, right?\\" Michael Fairman described the December 2017 scenes in which Ben attempts to re-enact Will's murder, as \\"riveting\\" \\"can't-miss soap opera!\\" He said the scenes were \\"portrayed masterfully\\" by Wilson and his co-stars, Alison Sweeney and Chandler Massey. The three \\"all played their beats to perfection in this very dark and twisted plotpoint.\\" On-Air On-Soaps said Wilson had the \\"Best Performance by a recurring\\" actor for the year 2017. Fairman said \\"Wilson has taken this disturbed character and brought him to soap opera cult status.\\" Gold Derby and Soap Hub credited Ben's 2017 return with helping the show win its 4th Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series as one of the episodes submitted featured Wilson's reappearance as Ben. = Reintroduction (2018) = Diane Brounstein of Soap Hub described Ben's 2018 reintroduction as a \\"smart move.\\" She continued, \\"While the move may seem like a hard one to pull off [‚Ä¶] there's no denying that the actor is mesmerizing to watch.\\" On-Air On-Soaps said \\"You can never get enough of ole‚Äô Ben Weston in your life now can you?\\" Michael Fairman said \\"it will be intriguiging to see just how Ben is integrated back into the canvas\\" with Ron Carlivati as head writer. Kambra Clifford of Soapcentral.com described the announcement as \\"killer news.\\" Canyon News said the storyline would cause \\"fireworks galore.\\" Soap Opera Spy said \\"Even though Ben has caused quite a lot of trouble in Salem, there‚Äôs no denying that fans still tune in to see him.\\" However, not everyone was excited about the character's reintroduction. Jack Ori of TV Fanatic said \\"I know a lot of people are fans of Batty Ben, but I'm not one of them. ‚Ä¶ I don't see him as redeemable.\\" Ori continued that \\"The idea of Ben being so easily redeemed irks me.\\" Ori said the \\"rushed nature\\" of Ben's return was \\"annoying.\\" Christine Orlando said that while she appreciated Wilson's portrayal, \\"I'm not really sure what purpose it serves to bring Ben back to Salem.\\" While she was excited for the return, Laurisa of Soapcentral.com said \\"My biggest issue with reformed Ben is that [Robert Scott Wilson] does such a superb job of playing the villain. I'm not so sure I want to see him do anything else.\\" Soap Opera Digest described the character's reintroduction as \\"misguided\\" and said \\"The idea of [Ben] mingling with the loved ones of his victims is off-putting.\\" While the magazine agreed that keeping \\"Ben on canvas a villain\\" could generate \\"interesting\\" plots, \\"trying to transform him into a romantic leading man is a big stretch.\\" References External links * * Category:Days of Our Lives characters Category:Fictional serial killers Category:Television characters introduced in 2014 Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional victims of child abuse Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas ","title":"Ben Weston (Days of Our Lives)"},{"id":"43099331","text":"Homegrown Player Rule may refer to: * Homegrown Player Rule (Major League Soccer), USA * Homegrown Player Rule (England) * Homegrown Player Rule (UEFA) ","title":"Homegrown Player Rule"},{"id":"43099340","title":"Silver Bowl (horse race)"},{"id":"43099353","text":"Bundesgesetzblatt, Bonn, 23 May 1949, No. 1 BGBl. 1990 The German Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl.)

She is the lead plaintiff in Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc.  Biography  As of 2014, Blackhorse is a psychiatric social worker in Phoenix, Arizona. She has also worked at Arizona State Hospital. While a student at the University of Kansas, she attended a game between the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium and reported: > At an NFL game in Kansas City, \\"people yelled, 'Go back to your > reservation!' 'We won, you lost, get over it!' 'Go get drunk!' And so many > different slurs ‚Ä¶ I've experienced racism in my lifetime, but to see it > outwardly, and nobody did anything?\\"  Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc.  Blackhorse is the lead plaintiff in Blackhorse v. Pro-Football, Inc., which seeks to revoke trademark protection of the term \\"Washington Redskins\\". The case was actually began by Susan Harjo, but Blackhorse is known by its rekindled efforts because her name is alphabetically first out of the new plaintiffs. The USPTO rejected an application to register \\"Redskins Hog Rinds\\" because it \\"consists of or includes matter which may disparage or bring into contempt or disrepute persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols\\". Since 1992, the USPTO has rejected eleven applications for other trademarks that included the word Redskins, based on the same reasons. Some of the applications were made by Pro-Football, Inc., including \\"Washington Redskins Cheerleaders\\". On June 18, 2014, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) voted to cancel the six trademarks held by the team in a two to one decision that held that the term \\"redskins\\" is disparaging to a \\"substantial composite of Native Americans\\", and this is demonstrated \\"by the near complete drop-off in usage of 'redskins' as a reference to Native Americans beginning in the 1960s.\\" In a press release the trademark attorney for the team stated that they were confident that they would once again prevail on appeal, and that today's decision will make no difference in the continued use of the Redskins name. Plaintiff Amanda Blackhorse said in an interview, \\"We‚Äôve been through this process for eight years now. We will continue to fight. And, you know, this is not the end for us.\\" In June 2017 the Supreme Court ruled that the provision of the trademark law barring disparaging names was an unconstitutional infringement on freedom of speech. That case (In Re Tam) involved the denial of a trademark for an Asian-American rock band, \\"The Slants\\". Both the Native American petitioners and the Justice Department have withdrawn from any further litigation now that the Supreme Court has rendered the legal issue moot. Blackhorse called the decision disheartening after 11 years of litigation. While it may be legal for the team to use the name, she said, that doesn‚Äôt make it right.

The loop representation is a quantum hamiltonian representation of gauge theories in terms of loops. The aim of the loop representation in the context of Yang‚ÄìMills theories is to avoid the redundancy introduced by Gauss gauge symmetries allowing to work directly in the space of physical states (Gauss gauge invariant states). The idea is well known in the context of lattice Yang‚ÄìMills theory (see lattice gauge theory). Attempts to explore the continuous loop representation was made by Gambini and Trias for canonical Yang‚ÄìMills theory, however there were difficulties as they represented singular objects. As we shall see the loop formalism goes far beyond a simple gauge invariant description, in fact it is the natural geometrical framework to treat gauge theories and quantum gravity in terms of their fundamental physical excitations. The introduction by Ashtekar of a new set of variables (Ashtekar variables) cast general relativity in the same language as gauge theories and allowed one to apply loop techniques as a natural nonperturbative description of Einstein's theory. In canonical quantum gravity the difficulties in using the continuous loop representation are cured by the spatial diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity. The loop representation also provides a natural solution of the spatial diffeomorphism constraint, making a connection between canonical quantum gravity and knot theory. Surprisingly there were a class of loop states that provided exact (if only formal) solutions to Ashtekar's original (ill-defined) Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation. Hence an infinite set of exact (if only formal) solutions had been identified for all the equations of canonical quantum general gravity in this representation! This generated a lot of interest in the approach and eventually led to loop quantum gravity (LQG). The loop representation has found application in mathematics. If topological quantum field theories are formulated in terms of loops, the resulting quantities should be what are known as knot invariants. Topological field theories only involve a finite number of degrees of freedom and so are exactly solvable. As a result, they provide concrete computable expressions that are invariants of knots. This was precisely the insight of Edward Witten who noticed that computing loop dependent quantities in Chern‚ÄìSimons and other three-dimensional topological quantum field theories one could come up with explicit, analytic expressions for knot invariants. For his work in this, in 1990 he was awarded the Fields Medal. He is the first and so far the only physicist to be awarded the Fields Medal, often viewed as the greatest honour in mathematics.  Gauge invariance of Maxwell's theory  The idea of gauge symmetries was introduced in Maxwell's theory. Maxwell's equations are abla \\\\cdot \\\\vec{E} = {\\\\rho \\\\over \\\\epsilon_0} \\\\qquad abla \\\\times \\\\vec{B} - \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mu_0 {\\\\partial \\\\vec{E} \\\\over \\\\partial t} = \\\\mu_0 \\\\vec{J} \\\\qquad abla \\\\times \\\\vec{E} + {\\\\partial \\\\vec{B} \\\\over \\\\partial t} = 0 \\\\qquad abla \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B} = 0 where \\\\rho is the charge density and \\\\vec{J} the current density. The last two equations can be solved by writing fields in terms of a scalar potential, \\\\phi, and a vector potential, \\\\vec{A}: \\\\vec{E} = - abla \\\\phi - {\\\\partial \\\\vec{A} \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\qquad \\\\vec{B} = abla \\\\times \\\\vec{A}. The potentials uniquely determine the fields, but the fields do not uniquely determine the potentials - we can make the changes: \\\\phi' = \\\\phi + {\\\\partial \\\\Lambda \\\\over \\\\partial t} \\\\qquad \\\\vec{A}' = \\\\vec{A} - abla \\\\Lambda without affecting the electric and magnetic fields, where \\\\Lambda (\\\\vec{x},t) is an arbitrary function of space-time . These are called gauge transformations. There is an elegant relativistic notation: the gauge field is A^\\\\mu = (\\\\phi , \\\\vec{A}) and the above gauge transformations read, {A^\\\\mu}' = A^\\\\mu + \\\\partial^\\\\mu \\\\Lambda. The so-called field strength tensor is introduced, F^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\partial^\\\\mu A^ u - \\\\partial^ u A^\\\\mu which is easily shown to be invariant under gauge transformations. In components, F^{0i} = E^i , \\\\qquad \\\\epsilon^{ijk} F^{jk} = B^i. Maxwell's source-free action is given by: S = - {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4x \\\\Big( F_{\\\\mu u} F^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Big). The ability to vary the gauge potential at different points in space and time (by changing \\\\Lambda (\\\\vec{x},t)) without changing the physics is called a local invariance. Electromagnetic theory possess the simplest kind of local gauge symmetry called U (1) (see unitary group). A theory that displays local gauge invariance is called a gauge theory. In order to formulate other gauge theories we turn the above reasoning inside out. This is the subject of the next section.  The connection and gauges theories  = The connection and Maxwell's theory = We know from quantum mechanics that if we replace the wave-function, \\\\psi (x), describing the electron field by \\\\psi' (x) = \\\\exp (i \\\\theta) \\\\psi (x) that it leaves physical predictions unchanged. We consider the imposition of local invariance on the phase of the electron field, \\\\psi' (x) = \\\\Omega \\\\psi (x) = \\\\exp (i \\\\theta (x)) \\\\psi (x) The problem is that derivatives of \\\\psi (x) are not covariant under this transformation: \\\\partial_\\\\mu (\\\\exp (i \\\\theta (x)) \\\\psi (x)) = \\\\Omega \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi (x) + \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Omega \\\\psi (x). In order to cancel out the second unwanted term, one introduces a new derivative operator \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu that is covariant. To construct \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu, one introduces a new field, the connection A_\\\\mu: \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu = \\\\partial_\\\\mu + i g A_\\\\mu (x). Then (\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu \\\\psi)' = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi' + i g A_\\\\mu' \\\\psi'= \\\\Omega \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\psi + (\\\\partial \\\\Omega) \\\\psi + i g A_\\\\mu' \\\\Omega \\\\psi The term \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Omega is precisely cancelled out by requiring the connection field transforms as A_\\\\mu' (x) = A_\\\\mu (x) + {i \\\\over g} [\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Omega (x)] \\\\Omega^{-1} (x) \\\\quad Eq 1.. We then have that (\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu \\\\psi)' = \\\\Omega \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu \\\\psi. Note that Eq 1 is equivalent to A_\\\\mu' (x) = A_\\\\mu (x) + {1 \\\\over g} \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\theta (x) which looks the same as a gauge transformation of the gauge potential of Maxwell's theory. It is possible to construct an invariant action for the connection field itself. We want an action that only has two derivatives (since actions with higher derivatives are not unitary). Define the quantity: F_{\\\\mu u} = {-i \\\\over g} [\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu , \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\mu] = {-i \\\\over g} [\\\\partial_\\\\mu + i g A_\\\\mu (x) , \\\\partial_ u + i g A_ u (x)] = {-i \\\\over g} \\\\Big( [\\\\partial_\\\\mu , \\\\partial_ u] + i g (\\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu) - g^2 [A_\\\\mu , A_ u] \\\\Big) = \\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u - \\\\partial_ u A_ u. The unique action with only two derivatives is given by: S = - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int d^4x \\\\Big( F_{\\\\mu u} F^{\\\\mu u} \\\\Big). Therefore, one can derive electromagnetic theory from arguments based solely on symmetry. = The connection and Yang-Mills gauge theory = We now generalize the above reasoning to general gauge groups. One begins with the generators of some Lie algebra: : [T_i , T_j] = i f^{ijk} T^k Let there be a fermion field that transforms as : \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi}' \\\\mapsto \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} (x) \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi} (x) = \\\\exp (i \\\\theta^i (x) T^i) \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi} (x) Again the derivatives of \\\\mathbf{\\\\Psi} (x) are not covariant under this transformation. We introduce a covariant derivative : \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal{D}}_\\\\mu = \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\partial_\\\\mu + i g \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) with connection field given by : \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) = A^i_\\\\mu (x) T^i We require that \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) transforms as: : \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu' (x) = \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) \\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{-1} + {i \\\\over g} \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} (\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}). We define the field strength operator : \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} = - {i \\\\over g} [\\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal{D}}_\\\\mu , \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal{D}}_ u] = \\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\mathbf{A}_ u - \\\\partial_ u \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu + i g [\\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu , \\\\mathbf{A}_ u] = (\\\\partial_\\\\mu A_ u^i - \\\\partial_ u A_\\\\mu^i + g f^{ijk} A_\\\\mu^j A_ u^k) T^i. As \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathcal{D}}_\\\\mu is covariant, this means that the F^i_{\\\\mu u} tensor is also covariant: : \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u}' = \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{-1} Note that \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} is only invariant under gauge transformations if \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} is a scalar, that is, only in the case of electromagnetism. We can now construct an invariant action out of this tensor. Again we want an action that only has two derivatives. The simplest choice is the trace of the commutator: : \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\hat{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{-1} \\\\hat{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathbf{F}^{\\\\mu u} \\\\hat{\\\\Omega}^{-1}) = \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mathbf{F}^{\\\\mu u}) The unique action with only two derivatives is given by: : S = - {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4 x Tr (\\\\mathbf{F}_{\\\\mu u} \\\\mathbf{F}^{\\\\mu u}) = - {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\int d^4 x \\\\operatorname{Tr} \\\\Big( F_{\\\\mu u}^i T^j F^{\\\\mu u}_j T^j \\\\Big) This is the action for Yang-mills theory.  The loop representation of the Maxwell theory  We consider a change of representation in the quantum Maxwell gauge theory. The idea is to introduce a basis of states labeled by loops \\\\mid\\\\gamma\\\\rangle whose inner product with the connection states is given by : \\\\langle A \\\\mid \\\\gamma\\\\rangle = W (\\\\gamma) = \\\\exp \\\\left[ie \\\\int_\\\\gamma dy^\\\\alpha A_\\\\alpha (y)\\\\right] The loop functional W (\\\\gamma) is the Wilson loop for the abelian U(1) case.  The loop representation of Yang‚ÄìMills theory  We consider for simplicity (and because later we will see this is the relevant gauge group in LQG) an SU(2) Yang‚ÄìMills theory in four dimensions. The field variable of the continuous theory is an SU(2) connection (or gauge potential) A^i_\\\\mu (x), where i is an index in the Lie algebra of SU(2). We can write for this field : \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) = A^i_\\\\mu (x) \\\\tau_i where \\\\tau_i are the su(2) generators, that is the Pauli matrices multiplied by i/2. note that unlike with Maxwell's theory, the connections \\\\mathbf{A}_\\\\mu (x) are matrix-valued and don't commute, that is they are non-Abelian gauge theories. We must take this into account when defining the corresponding version of the holonomy for SU(2) Yang‚ÄìMills theory. We first describe the quantum theory in terms of connection variable. = The connection representation = In the connection representation the configuration variable is A_a^i and its conjugate momentum is the (densitized) triad \\\\tilde{E}_i^a. It is most natural to consider wavefunctions \\\\Psi (A_a^i). This is known as the connection representation. The canonical variables get promoted to quantum operators: : \\\\hat{A}_a^i \\\\Psi [A] = A_a^i \\\\Psi [A] (analogous to the position representation \\\\hat{q} \\\\psi (q) = q \\\\psi (q)) and the triads are functional derivatives, : \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{E}}_a^i \\\\Psi [A] = - i {\\\\delta \\\\Psi [A] \\\\over \\\\delta A_a^i} (analogous to \\\\hat{p} \\\\psi (q) = - i {d \\\\psi (q) \\\\over dq}) = The holonomy and Wilson loop = Let us return to the classical Yang‚ÄìMills theory. It is possible to encode the gauge invariant information of the theory in terms of \`loop-like' variables. We need the notion of a holonomy. A holonomy is a measure of how much the initial and final values of a spinor or vector differ after parallel transport around a closed loop; it is denoted : h_\\\\gamma [A] Knowledge of the holonomies is equivalent to knowledge of the connection, up to gauge equivalence. Holonomies can also be associated with an edge; under a Gauss Law these transform as : (h'_e)_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = U_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}^{-1} (x) (h_e)_{\\\\gamma \\\\sigma} U_{\\\\sigma \\\\beta} (y). For a closed loop x = y if we take the trace of this, that is, putting \\\\alpha = \\\\beta and summing we obtain : (h'_e)_{\\\\alpha \\\\alpha} = U_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}^{-1} (x) (h_e)_{\\\\gamma \\\\sigma} U_{\\\\sigma \\\\alpha} (x) = [U_{\\\\sigma \\\\alpha} (x) U_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}^{-1} (x)] (h_e)_{\\\\gamma \\\\sigma} = \\\\delta_{\\\\sigma \\\\gamma} (h_e)_{\\\\gamma \\\\sigma} = (h_e)_{\\\\gamma \\\\gamma} or : \\\\operatorname{Tr} h'_\\\\gamma = \\\\operatorname{Tr} h_\\\\gamma. Thus the trace of an holonomy around a closed loop is gauge invariant. It is denoted : W_\\\\gamma [A] and is called a Wilson loop. The explicit form of the holonomy is : h_\\\\gamma [A] = \\\\mathcal{P} \\\\exp \\\\Big\\\\\\\\{ - \\\\int_{\\\\gamma_0}^{\\\\gamma_1} \\\\, ds \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}^a A_a^i (\\\\gamma (s)) T_i \\\\Big\\\\\\\\} where \\\\gamma is the curve along which the holonomy is evaluated, and s is a parameter along the curve, \\\\mathcal{P} denotes path ordering meaning factors for smaller values of s appear to the left, and T_i are matrices that satisfy the su(2) algebra : [T^i ,T^j] = 2i \\\\epsilon^{ijk} T^k. \\\\, The Pauli matrices satisfy the above relation. It turns out that there are infinitely many more examples of sets of matrices that satisfy these relations, where each set comprises (N+1) \\\\times (N+1) matrices with N = 1,2,3,\\\\dots, and where none of these can be thought to \`decompose' into two or more examples of lower dimension. They are called different irreducible representations of the su(2) algebra. The most fundamental representation being the Pauli matrices. The holonomy is labelled by a half integer N/2 according to the irreducible representation used. = Giles' Reconstruction theorem of gauge potentials from Wilson loops = An important theorem about Yang‚ÄìMills gauge theories is Giles' theorem, according to which if one gives the trace of the holonomy of a connection for all possible loops on a manifold one can, in principle, reconstruct all the gauge invariant information of the connection. That is, Wilson loops constitute a basis of gauge invariant functions of the connection. This key result is the basis for the loop representation for gauge theories and gravity. = The loop transform and the loop representation = The use of Wilson loops explicitly solves the Gauss gauge constraint. As Wilson loops form a basis we can formally expand any Gauss gauge invariant function as, \\\\Psi [A] = \\\\sum_\\\\gamma \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] W_\\\\gamma [A] . This is called the loop transform. We can see the analogy with going to the momentum representation in quantum mechanics. There one has a basis of states \\\\exp (ikx) labelled by a number k and one expands : \\\\psi [x] = \\\\int dk \\\\psi (k) \\\\exp (ikx). and works with the coefficients of the expansion \\\\psi (k). The inverse loop transform is defined by : \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] = \\\\int [dA] \\\\Psi [A] W_\\\\gamma [A]. This defines the loop representation. Given an operator \\\\hat{O} in the connection representation, : \\\\Phi [A] = \\\\hat{O} \\\\Psi [A], \\\\qquad \\\\text{Eq 1} one should define the corresponding operator \\\\hat{O}' on \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] in the loop representation via, : \\\\Phi [\\\\gamma] = \\\\hat{O}' \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma], \\\\qquad \\\\text{Eq 2} where \\\\Phi [\\\\gamma] is defined by the usual inverse loop transform, \\\\Phi [\\\\gamma] = \\\\int [dA] \\\\Phi [A] W_\\\\gamma [A]. \\\\qquad \\\\text{Eq 3} A transformation formula giving the action of the operator \\\\hat{O}' on \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] in terms of the action of the operator \\\\hat{O} on \\\\Psi [A] is then obtained by equating the R.H.S. of Eq \\\\; 2 with the R.H.S. of Eq \\\\; 3 with Eq \\\\; 1 substituted into Eq \\\\; 3, namely : \\\\hat{O}' \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] = \\\\int [dA] W_\\\\gamma [A] \\\\hat{O} \\\\Psi [A], or : \\\\hat{O}' \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] = \\\\int [dA] (\\\\hat{O}^\\\\dagger W_\\\\gamma [A]) \\\\Psi [A], where by \\\\hat{O}^\\\\dagger we mean the operator \\\\hat{O} but with the reverse factor ordering (remember from simple quantum mechanics where the product of operators is reversed under conjugation). We evaluate the action of this operator on the Wilson loop as a calculation in the connection representation and rearranging the result as a manipulation purely in terms of loops (one should remember that when considering the action on the Wilson loop one should choose the operator one wishes to transform with the opposite factor ordering to the one chosen for its action on wavefunctions \\\\Psi [A]).  The loop representation of quantum gravity  = Ashtekar‚ÄìBarbero variables of canonical quantum gravity = The introduction of Ashtekar variables cast general relativity in the same language as gauge theories. It was in particular the inability to have good control over the space of solutions to the Gauss' law and spatial diffeomorphism constraints that led Rovelli and Smolin to consider a new representation ‚Äì the loop representation. To handle the spatial diffeomorphism constraint we need to go over to the loop representation. The above reasoning gives the physical meaning of the operator \\\\hat{O}'. For example, if \\\\hat{O}^\\\\dagger corresponded to a spatial diffeomorphism, then this can be thought of as keeping the connection field A of W_\\\\gamma [A] where it is while performing a spatial diffeomorphism on \\\\gamma instead. Therefore, the meaning of \\\\hat{O}' is a spatial diffeomorphism on \\\\gamma, the argument of \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma]. In the loop representation we can then solve the spatial diffeomorphism constraint by considering functions of loops \\\\Psi [\\\\gamma] that are invariant under spatial diffeomorphisms of the loop \\\\gamma. That is, we construct what mathematicians call knot invariants. This opened up an unexpected connection between knot theory and quantum gravity. = The loop representation and eigenfunctions of geometric quantum operators = The easiest geometric quantity is the area. Let us choose coordinates so that the surface \\\\Sigma is characterized by x^3 = 0. The area of small parallelogram of the surface \\\\Sigma is the product of length of each side times \\\\sin \\\\theta where \\\\theta is the angle between the sides. Say one edge is given by the vector \\\\vec{u} and the other by \\\\vec{v} then, : \\\\begin{align} A & = \\\\ \\\\vec{u} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\vec{v} \\\\ \\\\sin \\\\theta = \\\\sqrt{\\\\ \\\\vec{u} \\\\^2 \\\\ \\\\vec{v} \\\\^2 (1 - \\\\cos^2 \\\\theta)} \\\\[6pt] & = \\\\sqrt{\\\\ \\\\vec{u} \\\\^2 \\\\ \\\\vec{v} \\\\^2 - (\\\\vec{u} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{v})^2} \\\\end{align} From this we get the area of the surface \\\\Sigma to be given by : A_\\\\Sigma = \\\\int_\\\\Sigma \\\\, dx^1 \\\\, dx^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\det \\\\; q^{(2)}} where \\\\det q^{(2)} = q_{11} q_{22} - q_{12}^2 and is the determinant of the metric induced on \\\\Sigma. This can be rewritten as : \\\\det \\\\; q^{(2)} = {\\\\epsilon^{3ab} \\\\epsilon^{3cd} q_{ac} q_{bc} \\\\over 2}. The standard formula for an inverse matrix is : q^{ab} = {\\\\epsilon^{bcd} \\\\epsilon^{aef} q_{ce} q_{df} \\\\over 2! \\\\det (q)} Note the similarity between this and the expression for \\\\det q^{(2)}. But in Ashtekar variables we have \\\\tilde{E}^a_i \\\\tilde{E}^{bi} = \\\\det (q) q^{ab}. Therefore, : A_\\\\Sigma = \\\\int_\\\\Sigma \\\\, dx^1 \\\\, dx^2 \\\\sqrt{\\\\tilde{E}^3_i \\\\tilde{E}^{3i}}. According to the rules of canonical quantization we should promote the triads \\\\tilde{E}^3_i to quantum operators, : \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{E}}^3_i \\\\sim {\\\\delta \\\\over \\\\delta A_3^i}. It turns out that the area A_\\\\Sigma can be promoted to a well defined quantum operator despite the fact that we are dealing with product of two functional derivatives and worse we have a square-root to contend with as well.For example see section 8.2 of A First Course in Loop Quantum Gravity, Gambini, R, and Pullin, J. Published by Oxford University Press 2011. Putting N = 2J, we talk of being in the J-th representation. We note that \\\\sum_i T^i T^i = J (J+1) 1. This quantity is important in the final formula for the area spectrum. We simply state the result below, : \\\\hat{A}_\\\\Sigma W_\\\\gamma [A] = 8 \\\\pi \\\\ell_{Planck}^2 \\\\beta \\\\sum_I \\\\sqrt{j_I (j_I + 1)} W_\\\\gamma [A] where the sum is over all edges I of the Wilson loop that pierce the surface \\\\Sigma. The formula for the volume of a region R is given by : V = \\\\int_R d^3 x \\\\sqrt{\\\\det (q)} = {1 \\\\over 6} \\\\int_R dx^3 \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_{abc} \\\\epsilon^{ijk} \\\\tilde{E}^a_i \\\\tilde{E}^b_j \\\\tilde{E}^c_k}. The quantization of the volume proceeds the same way as with the area. As we take the derivative, and each time we do so we bring down the tangent vector \\\\dot{\\\\gamma}^a, when the volume operator acts on non-intersecting Wilson loops the result vanishes. Quantum states with non-zero volume must therefore involve intersections. Given that the anti-symmetric summation is taken over in the formula for the volume we would need at least intersections with three non-coplanar lines. Actually it turns out that one needs at least four-valent vertices for the volume operator to be non-vanishing. = Mandelstam identities: su(2) Yang‚ÄìMills = We now consider Wilson loops with intersections. We assume the real representation where the gauge group is SU(2). Wilson loops are an over complete basis as there are identities relating different Wilson loops. These come about from the fact that Wilson loops are based on matrices (the holonomy) and these matrices satisfy identities, the so-called Mandelstam identities (see Mandelstam variables). Given any two SU(2) matrices \\\\mathbb{A} and \\\\mathbb{B} it is easy to check that, : \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\mathbb{A}) \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\mathbb{B}) = \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\mathbb{A} \\\\mathbb{B}) + \\\\operatorname{Tr} (\\\\mathbb{A} \\\\mathbb{B}^{-1}). This implies that given two loops \\\\gamma and \\\\eta that intersect, we will have, : W_\\\\gamma [A] W_\\\\eta [A] = W_{\\\\gamma \\\\circ \\\\eta} [A] + W_{\\\\gamma \\\\circ \\\\eta^{-1}} [A] where by \\\\eta^{-1} we mean the loop \\\\eta traversed in the opposite direction and \\\\gamma \\\\circ \\\\eta means the loop obtained by going around the loop \\\\gamma and then along \\\\eta. See figure below. This is called a Mandelstam identity of the second kind. There is the Mandelstam identity of the first kind W (\\\\gamma_1 \\\\circ \\\\gamma_2) = W (\\\\gamma_2 \\\\circ \\\\gamma_1). Spin networks are certain linear combinations of intersecting Wilson loops designed to address the over-completeness introduced by the Mandelstam identities. Graphical representation of the Mandestam identity relating different Wilson loops. = Spin network states = In fact spin networks constitute a basis for all gauge invariant functions which minimize the degree of over-completeness of the loop basis, and for trivalent intersections eliminate it entirely. As mentioned above the holonomy tells you how to propagate test spin half particles. A spin network state assigns an amplitude to a set of spin half particles tracing out a path in space, merging and splitting. These are described by spin networks \\\\gamma: the edges are labelled by spins together with \`intertwiners' at the vertices which are prescription for how to sum over different ways the spins are rerouted. The sum over rerouting are chosen as such to make the form of the intertwiner invariant under Gauss gauge transformations. = Uniqueness of the loop representation in LQG = Theorems establishing the uniqueness of the loop representation as defined by Ashtekar et al. (i.e. a certain concrete realization of a Hilbert space and associated operators reproducing the correct loop algebra ‚Äì the realization that everybody was using) have been given by two groups (Lewandowski, Okolow, Sahlmann and Thiemann) and (Christian Fleischhack). Before this result was established it was not known whether there could be other examples of Hilbert spaces with operators invoking the same loop algebra, other realizations, not equivalent to the one that had been used so far.  Knot theory and loops in topological field theory  A common method of describing a knot (or link, which are knots of several components entangled with each other) is to consider its projected image onto a plane called a knot diagram. Any given knot (or link) can be drawn in many different ways using a knot diagram. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot. Given a knot diagram, one tries to find a way to assign a knot invariant to it, sometimes a polynomial ‚Äì called a knot polynomial. Two knot diagrams with different polynomials generated by the same procedure necessarily correspond to different knots. However, if the polynomials are the same, it may not mean that they correspond to the same knot. The better a polynomial is at distinguishing knots the more powerful it is. In 1984, Jones V. Jones, A polynomial invariant for knots via von Neumann algebras, reprinted in \`\`New Developments in the Theory of Knots, ed. T. Kohno, World Scientific, Singapore, 1989. announced the discovery of a new link invariant, which soon led to a bewildering profusion of generalizations. He had found a new knot polynomial, the Jones polynomial. Specifically, it is an invariant of an oriented knot or link which assigns to each oriented knot or link a polynomial with integer coefficients. In the late 1980s, Witten coined the term topological quantum field theory for a certain type of physical theory in which the expectation values of observable quantities are invariant under diffeomorphisms. Witten gave a heuristic derivation of the Jones polynomial and its generalizations from Chern‚ÄìSimons theory. The basic idea is simply that the vacuum expectation values of Wilson loops in Chern‚ÄìSimons theory are link invariants because of the diffeomorphism-invariance of the theory. To calculate these expectation values, however, Witten needed to use the relation between Chern‚ÄìSimons theory and a conformal field theory known as the Wess‚ÄìZumino‚ÄìWitten model (or the WZW model).

Duties and functions Traditionally, a librarian is associated with collections of books, as demonstrated by the etymology of the word \\"librarian\\" (from the Latin liber, \\"book\\"). The role of a librarian is continually evolving to meet social and technological needs. A modern librarian may deal provision and maintenance of information in many formats, including: physical books; electronic resources; magazines; newspapers; audio and video recordings; maps; manuscripts; photographs and other graphic material; bibliographic databases; and web-based and digital resources. A librarian may also provide other information services, including: computer provision and training; coordination with community groups to host public programs; basic literacy education; assistive technology for people with disabilities; and assistance locating community resources. Appreciation for librarians is often included by authors and scholars in the Acknowledgment sections of books. History in the United States Chariton Free Public Library, a Carnegie Library In the 19th century, librarianship began to emerge as a true profession. Male librarians (called \\"bookmen\\") were found in sophisticated academic institutions around the middle of the 19th century.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 78 Like the librarians of Alexandria, these librarians were primarily scholars, not custodians of the library in which they worked. At that time there was no formal training for librarians. Education in the field was gained by experience, either self-taught or under tutelage of other librarians. Experienced librarians quite often recruited trainees. In 1872, Publishers Weekly, an instructional publication focusing on the publishing industry, began to regularly devote small sections to librarians. In 1876, The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education published Public Libraries in the United States of America: Their History, Condition, and Management. Aimed at practicing librarians, the study included a manual written by notable authorities on librarianship with articles on management, administration, history, cataloging, popular reading, and library buildings.Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education.

Retrieved from https://archive.org/details/cu31924029529553 Carnegie libraries created an increased need for larger numbers of librarians to manage them, thus career library workers became an established permanent workforce.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 79 During this period, Melvil Dewey became a primary force in the professionalization of librarians and library education in the United States. Dewey believed that librarians are meant to provide patrons with \\"better\\" books to improve people and their way of life. In 1876, Dewey, Justin Winsor, Charles Ammi Cutter and other prominent librarians of the day, founded the American Library Association (ALA). The formation of this professional organization provided national visibility and recognition to the field of librarianship, while substantially strengthening the professional identity among the library practitioners.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 80 Around this time, Dewey founded the first major professional publication for librarians, Library Journal. Dewey founded the first library school, The School of Library Economy, which opened at Columbia College in 1887.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal- Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 81. The coursework programs offered by the library school took three months to complete, following which students had to take an internship of up to 2 years to gain exposure to and familiarity with professional tasks. Sarah Byrd Askew (1877‚Äì1942) pioneered the establishment of county libraries in the USA. After Dewey's library school, four more library schools were opened by 1900: Albany, Pratt Institute, Drexel University, and the Armour Institute.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 82 By 1919, there were 15 more programs in the United States. These programs varied by length of program, type of degree or certificate awarded, and requirements for admission. On completion of most programs, students became Bachelors of Library Science. At the time, the degree of Master of Library Science was not awarded anywhere but Albany.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 84 In recognition of the rise of Library education programs, ALA created the ALA Committee on Library Training in which members would review the various educational programs. This led to ALA‚Äôs \\"Standards for Library Education\\", which established separate standards for the different types of training programs. The neutral approach that ALA took to the Library Schools, however, influenced the schools to band together and create their own organization: the Association of American Library Schools. The Williamson Report, created for the Carnegie Corporation, however, was the most important review of library education programs. In the Williamson report, C.C. Williamson criticises the quality of many established programs, and designates a university graduate degree, not a college bachelor's degree, as the appropriate education for professional librarians.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 85 The Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, 1928-1989. was founded to respond to this need. It was thanks to the Williamson report that librarians were required to receive one year of postgraduate education in librarianship. By the 1950s most library schools in the US awarded a master's degree.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 86 It was at this point in history that the notion of library science was established as the study for future librarians. In addition to professional librarians, faculty in Library Science programs included other academics such as sociologists and historians.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 87 Because the faculty consisted mostly of scholars, they contributed a considerable amount of research which formed the foundation of the field of library science. Another notable progression that arose after the ‚ÄúWilliamson Report‚Äù was the establishment of The Hampton Institute Library School, the first library school to train African-American librarians in the US. After the establishment of the Hampton Institute Library School, more African-Americans were accepted to library schools, including Edward Christopher Williams, a graduate of the New York State Library School, who went on to become the director of the library at Howard University in 1916. With the expanding economy, the baby boom, and the important federal legislation supporting the development of education institutions and their libraries, library schools reached their heyday in the 1950s to 1960s. These factors lead to an increased need for librarians. By the 1970s, there were more than 70 accredited library schools with master‚Äôs programs in US and Canada.Rubin, Richard E. Foundations of Library and Information Science. Neal- Schuman Publishers, Inc. (2010) p. 88 By 1999, however, there were only 56 ALA-accredited library school programs in the US and Canada. As library schools were never high-profile departments, these closures were a result of universities' efforts to reduce costs during the recessions of the 1980s. History in Canada In the earlier half of the 19th century, Canada had no formal training or library schools to educate potential librarians. The Toronto Public Library held competitive examinations for librarian hopefuls. The first exam was held December 15, 1887 and tested candidates on writing, arithmetic, reading, and English Literature. In 1890, an additional qualification for exam graduation was added: candidates were required to be at least 5'3\\" (160 cm) tall.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences 41, no.2 (2003): p. 163. Successful candidates were referred to American library schools for training, or given the option of serving as apprentices to complete on-the-job training. The starting push to establish library schools in Canada came from George Locke, chief librarian of the Toronto Public Library from 1908‚Äì1937. When Locke started his reign as chief librarian at TPL, training for librarians was still limited to on the job training. He believed, however, that librarians should be formally trained in educational programs like those of the US. He favoured librarians that had a formal educational background in librarianship. In 1909, Locke recruited Winnifred Barnstead, a Canadian graduate of a two-year training course for librarians at Princeton University, to head the cataloguing department.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 164. Locke also hired Lillian H. Smith, a Canadian graduate from the training school at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, to head the Children's department.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 165. With the help of Barnstead and Smith, Locke began his own training program through the Toronto Public Library. A contemporary of Locke was Edwin A. Hardy, secretary of the Ontario Library Association from its inception in 1901 to 1925, then as president from 1925‚Äì1926.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 166. Hardy was vocal in his opinion of formal educational training for librarians, and desperately desired a library school in Canada for fear of losing Canadian librarians trained in the US to the US. He was active in establishing library institutes, one-day regional workshops, through Ontario departments of Education, the first of which was held in Brantford, Ontario in 1907. These institutes, however, proved insufficient, and there was a formal request for Departments of Education to begin a summer library school. The first of these summer schools ran in 1911; it was a hybrid program modelled after American schools and normal schools which educated teachers in Ontario. This program ran for four weeks in the summer when libraries were able to spare staff for training and eligible candidates were only those already employed in libraries. In 1919, it was extended to be a 3-month program and became the Ontario Library School. The first formal library education program in Canada was established at McGill University in 1904. The McGill Summer Library School was formally founded under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee, offering education in library administration. It was one of the first university programs in librarianship anywhere in the world outside the United States. Instrumental in the founding of the School and the establishment of its curriculum, Melvyl Dewey, a good friend and colleague of Charles Gould, University Librarian and a founder of the School, taught at the school during its first year. Library schools in Canada at this time, however, were unique to those in the US because many were under complete control of the Department of Education. While the Department of Education always provided funding for the library school, librarians were not able to push their own ideas or agenda. A course was established in the Ontario College of Education, located on the University of Toronto campus, to provide an academic and professional complement to the already established technical training of librarians. Barnstead became the first director, but all financial, hiring, and curriculum matters were made by the Dean of the College of Education and the Minister of Education. Graduates of the program did not receive a degree; they received a librarian's certificate from the Minister of Education and a diploma from the University of Toronto.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 167. It was not until the 1930s that the library school became a separate entity from the Department and Ministry of Education. In 1937, the library school at the University of Toronto received ALA accreditation and Canadian students began to receive a professional degree ‚Äì the Bachelor of Library Science.Boone, Elaine. \\"Cross Border Influences for Librarianship: The Toronto Experience.\\" Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences, 41, no. 2 (2003): 169.

Mobile workspace technology describes a set of software and services that deliver corporate apps, files and services to a user on any device and over any network. This technology was designed for business users that require access to all of their content on both corporate and personally- owned devices, including PCs, smartphones and tablets. Mobile workspace technologies are formed by bringing together a set of software and services including desktop virtualization, application virtualization, enterprise mobility management, file sharing, virtual private networks and more (see the full list below).  Business Need  According to recent research, combined shipments of devices including PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile phones are projected to reach 2.5 billion units in 2014, a 7.6 percent increase from 2013. This trend, which is expected to continue to grow, is being driven by users who utilize more than one device. In fact, today the average user has 3+ different devices that they use for work purposes on a daily basis. These mobile devices entering the enterprise has led to over 60% of information workers working outside of a traditional office. While the shift to mobility seems to be growing, it is causing problems for both the end user and IT department. End users don‚Äôt feel they are equipped to work outside of the office and IT is forced to manage the security risks presented by data and applications leaving the corporate network. To address these challenges, organizations are looking to mobile workspace technology that can provide users access to their corporate applications, files and services while maintaining security for their IT department. Mark Bowker, senior analyst, Enterprise Strategy Group said, \\"Mobile workspaces are playing a key role in addressing the new organizational imperative around secure mobility\\".  Components  Applications Microsoft (particularly Microsoft Office) have been the dominant office software suite for enterprise along with numerous other Windows applications. Newer to the market is the growth of Software-as-a- Service and web-based applications such as Salesforce.com, LinkedIn and Evernote. Additionally, mobile applications have seen growth of 200% from 2011 to 2012, a trend that is expected to continue into 2013. A mobile workspace includes access to all types of applications (Windows, mobile, web, SaaS, and HTML5-based) from the user device. Data Files access is important for business productivity as well as business collaboration. A user‚Äôs mobile workspace must give a user access to all of their corporate data and allow for this data to be accessible on multiple devices. This requirement for file sync and sharing has led to the growth of many online sharing options including Citrix Sharefile, Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and iCloud. Collaboration Due to factors like globalization, telecommuting and employees working outside of traditional offices, collaboration tools are becoming increasingly important. Collaboration tools include electronic communication, online web-conferencing, file sharing and social collaboration software. Network access People now work from all locations ‚Äì the office, a coffee shop, the airport, their homes ‚Äì yet still require access to their content. When outside the office, people still need access to resources behind the firewall generally requiring VPN access. A mobile workspace allows secure access to apps, data and services no matter where the user is or what type of network they are using (LAN, WAN, 3G/4G, etc.). Cloud As cloud computing becomes more popular, IT organizations are looking to the cloud to host more services than ever before. IT departments now can choose where to host their apps, data, desktops, etc. in the most appropriate location whether that‚Äôs on-premises in a datacenter or a private, public or hybrid cloud. Users need access to these resources from their mobile workspace. Any device Research suggests that mobile devices are set to outnumber the total number people on earth by 2014. As device types and manufacturers continue to grow, users still need to access their mobile workspace irrespective of device type, operating system or manufacturer.

The team was also referred to as the Covington Colonels or Covington Federals in contemporary newspaper reports. The team was moved to Kansas City in July 1913 and became known thereafter as the Kansas City Packers. History Baseball has been played in Covington since the 1870s, with the Star club a popular amateur side which competed with the top non- professional clubs in Ohio and Kentucky. On September 21, 1875, the Star Baseball Park hosted a National Association game between the Philadelphia Athletics and the Hartford Dark Blues; the Athletics (not to be confused with the 20th century team of this name) won, 13-9, in front of a crowd of 800. In 1912 or 1913, Covington city leaders tried to acquire a baseball franchise in the Class D Blue Grass League. The Cincinnati Reds, whose ballpark was just away across the Ohio River, blocked the move. Instead, after several larger cities backed out, Covington was awarded a franchise in the Federal League, a new \\"outlaw\\" circuit. The city raised $13,500, with $6,000 budgeted to build the ballpark. Bernard Wisenall, a prominent local architect, designed Federal Park (also called Riverbreeze Park) with a capacity of 6,000. The playing field‚Äîbounded by East 2nd Street, East 3rd Street, Madison Avenue and Scott Boulevard‚Äîwas tiny, possibly the smallest ever built for any pro baseball park. Its dimensions were just 194 feet down the right-field line, 267 feet to dead center, and 218 feet down the left-field line. Modern rules dictate no pro ballpark may have a fence closer than 325 feet, even down the foul lines; for comparison, Howard J. Lamade Stadium, the site of Little League Baseball's World Series, has 225-foot distances down the foul lines. Construction did not begin until a month before opening day. The Blue Sox started their season on a long road trip, with a game against Cleveland on May 3. The game ended in a 6-6 tie, called after ten innings due to darkness. The Blue Sox managed to sell out their first home game on May 9, with thousands of fans turned away. Covington's mayor George \\"Pat\\" Phillips declared a half-holiday for the city, closing city offices at noon and encouraging businesses to follow suit in support the team. Pregame festivities included a parade, bands, and decorations across city along with the mayor tossing out a golden ball for the ceremonial first pitch. Messenger pigeons were released to spread the news of the opening to each city on the Federal League circuit as well as one going to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Pitcher Walter Justus shut out the St. Louis Terriers in a 4-0 victory. However, Covington (which had about 55,000 people at the time) wasn't really a big enough town to support the team, and drew only an average of 650 for the remainder of their initial nine-game home stand. By June, the team was mired in fourth place with a 21‚Äì31 record and drawing a few hundred a game; altogether, the Sox had a total attendance of only about 8,000 to the nineteen home games after the opener. June 21 turned out to be the club's final home game. On June 23, it was announced that the Blue Sox would leaving town; on June 26, the league voted to move the team to Kansas City, where it was renamed the Packers. The owners of the Covington team yielded their rights to their creditors. After spending the 1913 season as an independent circuit, the Federal League declared themselves a major league in 1914; the league folded after the 1915 campaign, with the American and National Leagues essentially buying them out. Federal Park was used for other events over the next few years, including boxing and auto polo, but was torn down in 1919 to make room for a new tobacco warehouse. The warehouse was then later replaced by the present-day Kenton County Circuit Courthouse. Covington has not hosted a professional team in any sport since; however, Highland Heights, located from Covington, hosted indoor pro football in the early 2010s.

Three months later, on 17 June, Nahid Almanea, a 31-year-old Saudi student of the University of Essex, was also stabbed and killed. Teenager James Fairweather was apprehended while planning a third murder in May 2015, and in January 2016 he pleaded responsible for both deaths. In April 2016 he was found guilty of both murders and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 27 years. Perpetrator James Fairweather was 15 years old when he committed his murders, and 17 at his conviction. He attended Colchester Academy. He was bullied for his prominent ears. At school, he was involved in violent incidents, but none to suggest that he would become a murderer. He was in the lowest sets of each class, and classmates recalled him choosing \\"murderer\\" when asked to explain his desired career, as well as threatening a Columbine-style massacre in the final assembly; his peers brushed this off as posturing. Fairweather was convicted of knifepoint robbery of cigars in January 2014, and sentenced to a year's supervision. He was also convicted of criminal damage of a house in 2013. Murders Attfield, a father-of-five with brain damage after a car accident, was passing through Castle Park when he was attacked by Fairweather. He was found bleeding to death by paramedics, who could not save his life. The violence committed towards him startled the police, and the BBC decided that the details were too \\"gruesome to describe\\". In court, Fairweather said that voices had chosen Attfield to be his victim, and the voices began to laugh as he stabbed him. Almanea was killed in overgrowth on Salary Brook Trail near her home. He stabbed her in the abdomen before forcing the knife into her eyes and ultimately her brain, so that she could not \\"see evil\\". Legal proceedings =Initial investigation= Essex Police questioned 70 locals with a history of knife crime, including Fairweather, who gave an alibi and was not questioned further. , more than 900 potential witnesses had been interviewed. Det Supt Hawkings, Head of Major Crimes for Essex Police called the attack \\"brazen\\" for occurring in a public space where passersby were likely. Police said that despite no firm evidence, one line of enquiry was a possible hate crime. During the trial, by which time it was known that Almanea and Attfield were killed by the same person, it was announced that both had been selected randomly. Premature assumptions that it was a hate crime led the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) to threaten revenge attacks, using the Twitter hashtag #Colchester. The fact that Almanea and Attfield were unconnected people, and had been killed at different times of the day, led to a line of investigation that there could have been two separate killers. Fewer people went out in Colchester in public, and overgrowth was cleared to remove hiding places. =Arrest and investigation of Fairweather= Fairweather did not attempt another murder for over a year because the public were wary of the danger: on 27 May 2015 he was spotted loitering early in the morning by a concerned dogwalker. The police were called and interviewed Fairweather, who was wearing rubber-gripped gloves and bearing a knife. He was arrested. In August 2015, he told a psychiatrist some of the \\"most anti-social and violent thoughts\\" the professional had heard, saying that voices were telling him to burn babies and maim prostitutes. Searches of Fairweather's possessions included documentaries about serial killers such as the Yorkshire Ripper, but prosecutor Paul Scothern clarified that not all people with such interests are intent on imitating the killers. =Trial and sentencing= At the Old Bailey the following January, his name not disclosed to the public for reasons of age, he denied two charges of murder and possessing an illegal weapon, but admitted to two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Fairweather claimed to have psychosis, which was not found by a court psychiatrist. However, all four psychiatrists who testified agreed that Fairweather had an autistic spectrum disorder. He was found unanimously guilty by the jury on 22 April 2016, and was to be sentenced a week later, with Judge Robin Spencer, QC, saying that the minimum sentence would be 12 years. After the conviction, Attfield's mother Julie decried Fairweather as a \\"monster\\", condemning his cruelty to her son. On 29 April 2016, Fairweather was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 27 years. Fairweather tried to appeal the sentence but failed.

Location The NBL's headquarters and main brewery are in the town of Njeru in Buikwe District, approximately north-east of the central business district of Jinja, Uganda. This is approximately , by road, east of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. The coordinates of the company headquarters are 0¬∞26'19.0\\"N, 33¬∞10'47.0\\"E (Latitude:0.438620; Longitude:33.179720). Overview NBL had an estimated 52 percent share of the Ugandan beer market in 2013. This has since grown to 57 per cent. Eagle Lager was launched to promote the use of locally grown sorghum to make lager beers and to reduce reliance on imported raw materials. Brand extensions now include an Eagle Extra, Eagle Poa and Eagle Dark. History NBL started in 1951 as a single brewery in Jinja. The brewery was nationalised in 1972 by President Idi Amin. In 1997, South African Breweries bought a 40 percent share in the brewery, raising this to full ownership in July 2001. The company is now a proud part of the ABInBev family after the successful completion of the business combination with SABMiller plc in 2016. Operations In October 2013, NBL opened a new brewery in Mbarara, about , south-west of Kampala. Built at a cost of US$90.6 million (about UGX:235 billion), the brewery was projected to produce 5.5 million crates of beers annually. The new brewery uses sorghum, maize, and barley, which are grown mostly by farmers in the region. The products of this brewery are marketed locally and exported to South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A maltings plant with a 120-ton piece size was built on the brewery site at Jinja in 2011 to support a local barley growing initiative and to supply barley malt to the brewery. Involved in this construction was Excel Construction Limited, formed in 1992 as a joint venture company between the Madhvani Group and Gomba Construction Company Ltd. Brands As of 2013, Nile Breweries had ten locally produced beer brands (Nile Special, Nile Gold, Club Pilsner, Castle Lite, Castle Milk Stout, Eagle Lager, Eagle Extra, Eagle Dark, Eagle Poa and Chairman's ESB), one locally produced traditional African beer (Chibuku), two imported lagers (Castle Lager and Grolsch) . As of 2014, the flagship Nile Special brand was being exported to Kenya.

Plants in this genus are mostly terrestrial herbs with a fleshy, creeping rhizome and a loose rosette of green to maroon coloured leaves. Small resupinate or partly resupinate, dull coloured flowers are borne on a hairy flowering stem. The dorsal sepal and petals overlap and form a hood over the column and there is a deep pouch at the base of the labellum. They are found in tropical regions from northern India through Southeast Asia, China, Japan to Australia and some Pacific Islands. Description Orchids in the genus Rhomboda are usually terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herbs with a creeping, fleshy, above-ground rhizome anchored to the ground by wiry roots. A few species are epiphytic. The leaves are spirally arranged around the stem with the upper leaves forming a loose rosette. They are dark green to maroon or brownish with a central white or red line. The flowers are resupinate or partly resupinate with the dorsal sepal and petals fused to form a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are similar to the dorsal sepal, free and often spreading. The labellum has a deep pouch near its base, a narrow middle section and often has a hooked tip. Taxonomy and naming The genus Rhomboda was first formally described in 1857 by John Lindley and the description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The name Rhomboda is derived from the Ancient Greek word rhombos meaning \\"a top\\", referring to the shape of the calli on the labellum of the type specimen. Distribution Orchids in the genus Rhomboda are native to Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Japan, the Philippines, New Guinea, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Queensland between the Daintree and Paluma. =Species list= The following is a list of species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at August 2018: *Rhomboda abbreviata (Lindl.)

Sloper, who was 28 when the Titanic sank, traveled as a first-class passenger and was saved after boarding lifeboat #7, the first to be launched from the vessel. Titanic Sloper was born in New Britain, Connecticut, son of Andrew Jackson Sloper and Ella Thomson Sloper. In April 1912, he was returning to the United States after a three-month vacation in Europe. The stockbroker and estate manager planned to travel on board the RMS Mauretania. However, while still in Europe, he met the Canadian family of Mark Fortune and became very fond of his daughter Alice, prompting him to cancel his tickets aboard the Mauretania and purchase tickets for the maiden voyage of the Titanic. On the night of the sinking, Sloper was playing bridge with other men when the Titanic struck an iceberg and began to sink. At first, he didn't pay much attention to the turmoil on deck but as time passed he decided to leave the room and go up to deck. Since he thought that the Titanic was \\"unsinkable\\", he first refused to leave, but ultimately gave in after insistence by actress Dorothy Gibson who urged him to go with her aboard lifeboat #7. He would credit her with saving his life after the disaster. On April 19, 1912, one day after arriving in New York City aboard the RMS Carpathia, a tabloid newspaper identified him as one of the passengers who had dressed in women's clothing to get their spot in the lifeboats. Sloper would spend the rest of his life denying the accusations.Just Like a Woman, Snopes.com. Life after the Titanic After the disaster, Sloper became a managing partner of a private investment firm.

Freedom House demanded immediate information about where and why the scholar was held by the authorities.\\"Tajikistan Must Shed Light on Disappearance of Researcher\\". Freedom House, 2014-06-17. Retrieved 2014-07-29. Human Rights Watch called on Tajikistan to present credible evidence against the scholar or release him immediately. Amnesty International called Sodiqov a \\"prisoner of conscience\\" and claimed that charges laid against him were \\"politically motivated\\". Reporters Without Borders called for Sodiqov's immediate release, describing charges laid against him as \\"absurd\\". The Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE), PEN International, and a coalition of over 60 human rights NGOs from across the OSCE region also condemned Sodiqov's arrest and demanded that Tajikistan release him. Academic institutions, societies, scholars, and academic freedom groups also organized a campaign to pressure Tajikistan into releasing the scholar and dropping charges against him. The University of Toronto that Sodiqov was affiliated with expressed concern about Sodiqov's detention and requested that Tajikistan resolve the matter with his detention. The department of political science at McGill University issued a similar statement. A number of petitions demanding Sodiqov's release, including one organized by Tajikistani students and alumni of foreign universities and one organized by a group of \\"concerned scholars,\\" were circulating online. The scholar's academic supervisor and other graduate students at the University of Toronto set up a website, www.freealexsodiqov.org, and used social media to disseminate information about Sodiqov's cause, using the hashtag #freealexsodiqov. The Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) called on Tajikistan to \\"immediately release\\" Sodiqov. Scholars at Risk, an international group comprising over 300 academic institutions in 36 countries, sent a letter to Tajikistan's foreign minister, requesting that the scholar is released. On 23 June 2014, four academic societies (the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies; Association for the Study of Nationalities; Central Eurasian Studies Society (CESS); and European Society for Central Asian Studies) representing about 4,500 scholars of Eurasia expressed \\"strong concern\\" over Sodiqov's detention and asked the head of Tajikistan's State Committee for National Security to release him. In July 2014, a broader statement from 20 scholarly societies encompassing over 60,000 academics called for Sodiqov's release. Several French and Swiss academic societies supported the statement. Although much less is known about international political and diplomatic pressure exerted on Tajikistan to release Sodiqov, that pressure was significant. Shortly after the scholar's arrest, the government of Canada requested that Tajikistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs keep it informed about Sodiqov's case. Canadian and British envoys in Central Asia were also discussing the case with the authorities in Tajikistan. Chrystia Freeland, who was at the time a member of Canadian parliament, said she was concerned about the scholar's detainment and that she was joining efforts to ensure his release. Another Canadian MP, Paul Dewar, sent a letter to Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, requesting information about the Canadian government's efforts to secure the scholar's release. The United States government was also in close contract with Tajikistan about the scholar's case, particularly because the US is the principal provider of training, equipment, and other types of support for the State Committee for National Security that had arrested Sodiqov. On July 17, 2014, the US envoy to the OSCE told the organization's permanent council in Vienna that the United States was \\"deeply concerned\\" about the scholar's continuing detention. Sirojiddin Aslov, the then-Foreign Minister of Tajikistan, came under significant political pressure during his official visit to Great Britain in early July 2014. Shortly before the visit, a group of British scholars penned a letter to the United Kingdom's foreign secretary William Hague, describing Sodiqov's arrest as an attack on academic freedom and asking him to call on the Tajik minister to release the scholar. When Aslov arrived in London, Hague did not meet with him. Instead, the-then senior minister of state Baroness Warsi met with the Tajik foreign minister, raising the case of the scholar's arrest with him. The case was also raised at Aslov's meeting with British members of parliament, selected lords and ladies, and academics.  Release  On 22 July 2014, after more than a month in detention, Sodiqov was released on an understanding not to leave the city or talk to media about his case. On August 18, as the initial period of investigation into Sodiqov's case expired, the authorities extended the investigation and announced that the case was still open. On September 10, 2014, the scholar was allowed to return to his studies in Canada, although Tajikistan did not drop the charges against him or close the case.

It is classified by CAMRA as a pub with a regionally important historic interior. The pub is affectionately referred to by locals as \\"The Dog\\", and sometimes as \\"The Dog and Hat\\". The pub is particularly noteworthy for its post-war connection to the British poetry movement. It is described by Nikolaus Pevsner as, \\"a cheerfully cross gabled pub\\". History The Crown and Greyhound gets its name from two former pubs in Dulwich Village, The Crown, and The Greyhound, which were across the street from each other up to the 1890s. The Crown is Britain's second most common pub name, and using a sign bearing a crown represented a convenient way to show support for the reigning monarch, without the need to change with the occupant of the throne. Pubs called The Greyhound are generally associated with hunting traditions, befitting of the Dulwich Village locality, which still retains elements of its rural origins to this day. The two inns once attracted a different clientele, The Greyhound being home to the Dulwich Club and middle-class drinkers, whilst The Crown being more the 'local' of the numerous agricultural workers in the area. For many years, The Crown pub was run by the Goodman family, most of whom are buried in the Old Burial Ground, within a hundred yards of the present pub. By the end of the nineteenth century, with encroaching urbanisation in East Dulwich, the customer bases of the two inns had begun to converge, and shortly before 1900, both inns were demolished and replaced by the present Crown & Greyhound Hotel. The present building was built in the Old English style in about 1897, on the site of The Crown. The Mosaic tilework at the left-hand entrance to this building (now hidden by carpet) still reads \\"The Crown\\". The original architects for The Crown and Greyhound were Eedle and Meyers, who specialised in pub design. The original plans included a billiards room at the back of the pub, a skittle alley as an outbuilding, a coffee room, and even a masonic temple room on the first floor. A contemporary account notes that one side of the drinking area at the front of the pub was still ‚Äúcarefully divided off for the better class of customer‚Äù and that some small bars catered for ‚Äúthe lower class of customer and for the jug and bottle trade‚Äù. The Cannon Brewery Company Ltd took over the running of the new pub when it first opened. The December 1897 issue of the Licensed Victuallers Gazette describes the pub as a \\"mahogany and plate- glass\\" monstrosity. The proprietor of the pub at this time was Robert J. Brinkley. The pub retains its snob screens, although they have been re-sited over the partition between the main bar and former coffee room. The ground floor of the pub is subdivided into roughly 4 different rooms, which are described as exhibiting, \\"a spatial quality in the proportions, windows, and detailing that includes panelling, beams, etched glazing and curved bar which is continuous throughout\\". The Crown and Greyhound's friezes and ceiling decoration are particularly impressive. The pub also merits a Taylor Walker Heritage Inn blue plaque, by virtue of its historic interest. On 13 August 1932, Alfred Edward Shervell (aged 49), the proprietor of the Crown and Greyhound in Dulwich Village, is reported to have died from his injuries in Nelson Hospital, Merton after falling in front of a train at South Wimbledon Tube Station. Dorene and Sydney Kitching are recorded as being the licensees of the Crown and Greyhound for over twenty years from the 1950s. Sidney became a publican following duties as a fighter pilot in the RAF during World War ll. It is noted that, in restoring catering to the pub, the Kitchings turned the entire pub into an open area, thus effectively eliminating the public bar on the left-hand side of the building, and unifying prices across the pub. Two elderly widows named Alice and Ivy, who were regulars of the public bar, are recorded as boycotting the pub for a short period afterwards, in protest at the increase of a penny on their pint of Guinness. In the 1970s, the professional wrestler Mick McManus lived locally near Denmark Hill station. Nicknamed \\"The Dulwich Destroyer\\", he was regularly seen in the Crown and Greyhound at this time. The day after the General Election in 2001, Tessa Jowell describes receiving a phone call from the Prime Minister's office about an invitation to join Tony Blair's Cabinet, ‚ÄúThere we were in the garden of the Crown and Greyhound in Dulwich Village and again it was a lovely sunny evening and my phone went. My agent picked it up out of my bag and said 'Oh, it‚Äôs Number 10 switchboard'.\\" The Crown and Greyhound's village roots, make this a regular venue for Morris dancers in the summer. The pub is also traditionally open on Christmas Day for locals in Dulwich Village to get together for a celebratory festive toast. Dulwich Hamlet Football Club The former Crown Inn (on the site of the current Crown and Greyhound) is documented as regular haunt of the players of Dulwich Hamlet F.C. from the time of club's foundation in 1893, when players used to carry their goal posts through the pub's grounds, and stop by for a drink after matches. Supporter, Bill Kirby, aged 97, recounts the story of Dulwich Hamlet players returning to the Crown and Greyhound after their victory in the 1937 FA Amateur Cup Final, where the cup trophy, \\"was duly filled with booze, and an underage Bill was one of many to take a good swig from it\\". At this time, it is stated that the team used to frequent the Crown and Greyhound after every home game. Literary Associations The Greyhound pub in Dulwich Village, demolished (along with The Crown Inn) to make way for construction of The Crown and Greyhound, was where the Dulwich Club held its meetings. This association was established in 1772, for the purposes of friendly converse and social cheer among a large body of literary gentlemen, and entertained many distinguished guests, including Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Mark Lemon, and others. The Crown and Greyhound was home to a branch of the British Poetry Society, founded by local poet Lionel Monteith in 1949. The foundation of this branch was almost certainly in response to ongoing turmoil at the Poetry Society, precipitated by 29-year-old Muriel Spark falling out with the society's old guard whilst combining her role as General Secretary with editing the Poetry Review. Another local Dulwich poet, and Spark's lover, Howard Sergeant, resigned his position on the Executive Council of the Poetry Society, and became an influential figure in setting up the Dulwich Poetry Group in 1949, and again, when it re-formed in 1959. Guest poets such as Stephen Spender, Laurie Lee, Dannie Abse, Marie Stopes, and Michael Croft are recorded as attending meetings at the pub during this first incarnation of the Dulwich Poetry Group. It is recorded that the audience was invited to an hour and three-quarters of readings by poets, for a suggested donation of one shilling. The first recorded sighting of Michael Croft in the Crown and Greyhound was in autumn 1950, after an Alleyn's School Old Boy was stopped on the street by a burly figure in a duffel coat who inquired amicably, \\"Where can an old sailor get a drink around here?\\" Croft was then 29 years old, and had just started teaching at the school. Alan Sillitoe at the Crown and Greyhound, Dulwich The Crown and Greyhound is particularly associated with the \\"Bards in the Boozer\\", who met there monthly during the 1960s. B. S. Johnson and Zulfikar Ghose, were invited by Howard Sergeant to organise some of the meetings, and celebrated writers and poets reading at the Crown and Greyhound during this period included Alan Sillitoe, Ted Hughes, Edwin Brock, and Jenny Joseph. A photo exists of B. S. Johnson \\"looking bored senseless at a Dulwich Group poetry reading\\", upstairs at the Crown and Greyhound. Zulfikar Ghose describes the Dulwich Poetry Group as, \\"not formed as such, but evolving into one\\", and states that the contemporary photos of a reading at the Crown and Greyhound, taken for the cultural magazine Scene were, \\"all posed\\". He also recounts that Harold Pinter and Theodore Roethke were both persuaded to give readings. In the aforementioned article in Scene magazine, B. S. Johnson writes that the inaugural meeting of the reformed Dulwich Poetry Group took place in September 1959. Nicholas Hagger recalls attending a meeting of the Dulwich Poetry Group at the Crown and Greyhound, and talking to B. S. Johnson, a conversation which carried on while they had a pee, during which Johnson said: \\"I am concerned to push the technical experiments in the novel to their utmost.\\" B. S. Johnson himself, in his 16 April 1966 article for London Life magazine entitled, \\"A Hard Glance at the Poetry Business\\", describes the Dulwich Poetry Group readings upstairs at the Crown and Greyhound as the best in London, \\"and audiences of over a hundred (on one sweltering occasion, three hundred) are common.\\" He ascribes this success to the \\"informal atmosphere\\", and fact that, \\"the audience can meet the poets down in the bar afterwards.\\" The poet George MacBeth, described as \\"the slim Edwardian dandy\\", is recorded as performing a reading at the pub in 1963. Edwin Morgan, widely recognised as one of the foremost Scottish poets of the 20th century, describes reading his poetry at The Crown and Greyhound in 1972. Alasdair Aston is recorded as being a leading light in the Dulwich Poetry Group which met at the Crown & Greyhound, being involved in the revival of poetry at the Crown and Greyhound in 1959, and serving as chairman of the Group from 1969-1975. In the 1986 book \\"At the Dog in Dulwich: Recollections of a poet\\", Patricia Doubell, who also served as chairman at the Dulwich Poetry Group, recalls readings at the Crown and Greyhound by Ivor Cutler, Seamus Heaney, and Stevie Smith. She also records the final reading of the Dulwich Poetry Group as taking place on 28 July 1983. Recent history From 2013, up until its closure for refurbishment in September 2014, The Crown and Greyhound was home to \\"The Goose Is Out\\" folk club. The pub was also home to the Dulwich Chess Club on Monday nights prior to its closure in 2014, and a venue for the annual Dulwich Festival, which takes place each May. Local amateur dramatic group, The Dulwich Players, also used the pub as its regular meeting place.

Uploaded on June 15, 2010. Modified on June 18, 2013. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. Early life and education Antonio Maceo Smith was born in Texarkana, Texas, where he attended segregated schools. His parents were Howell and Winnie Smith. Smith graduated with an AB in 1924 from Fisk University, a historically black university in Nashville, Tennessee where he would go on to be honored as Alumnus of the Year in 1949. Smith was awarded an MBA at New York University in 1928. He earned further master's degrees in economics and business law at Columbia University.Mack, Dwayne. Smith, Antonio Maceo (1903-1977) at BlackPast.org Careers in entrepreneurship and public service Smith first owned an advertising agency in New York City, and then a real estate firm in Texarkana. In 1932, he moved to Dallas, where he taught business administration in the segregated Dallas public schools, and published a weekly black newspaper, the Dallas Express. In 1933, Smith became the first executive secretary of the Dallas Negro Chamber of Commerce, where he spearheaded voter registration drives. He was appointed as the deputy director of the Hall of Negro Life at the Texas Centennial Exposition in 1936, and later that year, wed Fannie Fletcher. Turning from entrepreneurship to public service, in 1937, Smith became an administrative aide in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). He was appointed regional relations advisor for Region VI in the United States Housing Authority in 1939. He went on to become assistant regional administrator for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and retired in 1972. Civil Rights activism and community involvement Smith fought against Texas' white primary system, which disenfranchised nonwhite voters. That campaign led to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944), that did away with white primaries nationwide. Smith also fought against school segregation in a legal campaign that led to Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), a case that paved the way for Brown v. Board of Education. Smith co- chaired the Biracial Committee for the City of Dallas, where he helped lead the city's desegregation. He served on the NAACP's national board of directors from 1953 until 1957, when he was forced to resign by his FHA supervisors. He was also a leader in the Texas State Negro Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Council of Negro Organizations, the Dallas Urban League, the Texas State Progressive Voters League, the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the Rotary Club of Dallas, the Knights of Pythias, the New Hope Baptist Church, and at Bishop College. Local legacy The A. Maceo Smith High School building and the A. Maceo Smith Federal Building, both in Dallas, are named for Smith. The previous A. Maceo Smith zoned high school was replaced by A. Maceo Smith New Tech High School, now New Tech High School at B.F. Darrell, while Barack Obama Male Leadership Academy at A. Maceo Smith occupies the former Smith campus.

She was one of about 20 such vessels that the navy would then employ primarily for convoy escort duties. She served on active duty until 1810, capturing one small privateer. She then served as a receiving ship until 1836 when the navy sold her for breaking up. Career The Admiralty purchased Hercules in July 1803, renaming her Merlin. From 20 July to 20 September she was at Deptford fitting out for naval service. Commander Edward Pelham Brenton commissioned her in September. On 28 October 1803, Merlin and were off Dunkirk when they pursued and drove on shore the French privateer lugger Sept Freres. Sept Freres was armed with two guns and had a crew of 30 men under the command of Citizen Pollet. Milbrook anchored close to the lugger and came under fire from some field guns on shore. Though she took some hits, the British suffered no casualties. Head money was finally paid in May 1827. In December Merlin was attached to the Channel fleet and was in company with on patrol off the Cape La Hogue searching for French coastal shipping and privateers attempting to slip out of the Normandy port of Cherbourg. At 8pm on 10 December, Shannon grounded on Tatihou Island, near Barfleur, during a heavy gale.Hepper (1994), p. 103. Merlin spotted land thanks to a bolt of lighting and was able to wear off in time. A shore battery fired on Shannon, killing some men. When it was clear that Shannon could not be gotten off, her captain surrendered. The French army then took the officers and men prisoners. Some French fishing boats took possession of Shannon but saw that her hull was so damaged that she would be impossible to refloat.Troude (1867), p.306. Merlin stood back into shore on the 16th and at 11.30am dispatched two boats of marines and sailors to destroy Shannon to prevent the French from salvaging her guns and stores. Despite heavy fire from the island's batteries the boarders were able to burn and destroy the frigate without suffering a single casualty. Later in December, Merlin and detained the Traveller, Hall, master, which was sailing from Alexandria to Havre. They sent Traveller into Portsmouth.Lloyd's List, no. 4414, - accessed 20 June 2014. On 25 May 1804 Merlin was part of a squadron of six vessels that captured Matilda. In July and August Merlin participated in the squadron under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver in at the bombardment of French vessels at Le Havre. The bomb vessels' shells and carcasses set the town on fire on 23 July. Merlin was one of only two British vessels that suffered hits from enemy fire and there were no British casualties. On 1 August, the vessels kept a continuous fire for three hours. Still, it is not clear that the bombardment did much damage to the French flotilla. On 22 July Merlin captured the Shepherdess, and on 31 July Merlin and the squadron capture the French vessel Papillon. Merlin also shared in the capture, on 15 September, of the Flora de Lisboa, off Havre. Commander Robert Forbes replaced Brenton in January 1805. Merlin was in company with , , and the hired armed cutters Frances and Nelson on 16 April at the capture of the Charlotte Christina. Merlin shared with and Prevoyante in the proceeds from the capture on 11 June of the Prussian ship Edward. The proceeds were forwarded from Gibraltar. In an enclosure to a letter dated 7 October 1805, Admiral Lord Nelson wrote, \\"Jalouse, Childers, and Merlin being unfit for the service of this Country, are ordered home with the first Convoy to be repaired\\".Nicholas (1846), Vol. 7, p.85. Still, by March 1806 Merlin was in the West Indies, and under the command of Commander William Standway Parkinson.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, p.249. On 26 AprilMerlin escorted 16 vessels from Barbadoes to Demerara, Surinam, and Berbice.Lloyd's List, no. 4062, - accessed 20 June 2014. Commander William Fisher replaced Parkinson on 25 February 1807.O'Byrne (1849), VOl. 1, p.359. By April 1807 Merlin was laid up. The navy paid her off in June at Portsmouth. Fate In October 1810 the Navy had Merlin fitted as a receiving ship at Portsmouth. The \\"Commissioners for executing the office of Lord High Admiral\\" offered the Merlin sloop, of 395 tons (bm), lying at Portsmouth, for sale on 21 January 1836.

Cathleen Enright, then executive director of Council for Biotechnology Information, said GMO Answers was not specifically created to advocate against GMO labeling, but rather to provide accurate information about GMOs to consumers: \\"We have been accused of purposely hiding information. We haven't done that but now we will open the doors and provide information.\\" Anti-GMO activists have characterized GMO Answers as a public relations ploy by the seed biotech industry to influence an intensifying debate concerning the safety of GMOs and GMO labeling. Huffington Post reported on 130 pages of Ketchum PR internal documents discussing the launch of GMO Answers with a strategy of \\"embracing skepticism.\\" Ketchum's internal documents also discussed ‚Äúongoing development of relationships‚Äù with Washington Post columnist Tamar Haspel as well as The Motley Fool and Politico.  Background  The safety of GMOs has been described as the \\"most visible and contentious\\" public debate regarding food production technologies used in the U.S. food supply chain. In a January 2013 New York Times poll, 93 percent of respondents said that foods containing GMOs or genetically engineered ingredients should be identified. The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 1,480 Americans and the results showed that over a third of Americans believe genetically modified food poses health risks. The survey made the statement, \\"GM foods are ___ for health than non-GM foods.\\" 39% of the respondents responded \\"worse\\", 48% responded, no better or no worse, 10% responded better, leaving 3% of respondents that didn't answer the question. The data shows there is still a tendency for the average American to believe GM food is worse for health. Polls by the Oklahoma State University Department of Agricultural Economics have shown that over 80 percent of respondents supported mandatory labels of genetically modified food, but the same number supported labels for food containing DNA. There is a scientific consensusBut see also: And contrast: and that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction.Some medical organizations, including the British Medical Association, advocate further caution based upon the precautionary principle: Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. = GMO labeling legislation = Growing consumer interest in transparency regarding food production has given rise to GMO labeling initiatives across the U.S. in several states. In 2012 and 2013, GMO labeling ballot initiatives were defeated in California and Washington state. Also in December 2013, Connecticut became the first state in the U.S. to enact GMO labeling legislation, followed by Maine a month later. The Connecticut and Maine bills required that any combination of contiguous Northeast states totaling at least 20 million residents must adopt similar laws in order for the regulations to take effect. In August 2013, a Scientific American editorial called mandatory labeling of genetically modified foods a \\"bad idea\\": = GMO labeling initiatives by U.S. food producers = In 2013, several U.S. food producers announced plans to label or disclose the presence of GMOs in their products, including grocery retailer Whole Foods Market, restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc., and ice cream maker Ben & Jerry's. In January 2014, General Mills, Inc. announced that it began manufacturing GMO-free original Cheerios in late 2013.  GMOAnswers.com  In July 2013, the seed biotech industry and its partners in farming and agriculture launched the GMOAnswers.com website \\"to combat mounting opposition to genetically modified foods among consumer groups and activists.\\" Also in July 2013, Paul Schickler, president of DuPont Pioneer, the agricultural unit of DuPont, said anti-GMO interests had used the Internet effectively to disseminate their message, and that the seed biotech industry sought to employ the Internet and social media channels to similar effect: \\"[GMOAnswers.com] is an effort to increase the dialogue ...

A trampoline safety net enclosure is a trampoline accessory that significantly reduces the chance of fall off and frame impact injuries. History The first commercially successful trampoline safety net enclosures were invented and patented by Mark Publicover in the United States and first sold there in 1997 by JumpSport Trampolines. By 2006 80% of all new trampoline sales included safety net enclosures. Safety benefits While a trampoline is safest when only one person jumps at a time, in practice the enjoyment derived from multiple simultaneous jumpers means that this recommendation is often disregarded. The benefit of an enclosure is that it keeps jumpers from falling off a trampoline or impacting the frame. Safety net enclosures vary from one manufacturer to another, such as the opening in the net so that jumpers may enter and exit the trampoline. The design of such openings may include: snap/Velcro system, zipper, or overlapping sections. The snap, zipper, and Velcro systems require the person entering to both open and close the entrance, allowing for the possibility of misuse, whereas the doubled over system avoids this requirement by being a passive solution.

A native of Redondo Beach, California, Nielsen attracted interest from the Arizona Wildcats and USC Trojans college football teams. Because he believed the Arizona environment would be better for his asthma, he spurned the local Trojans and accepted an athletic scholarship to play for the Wildcats. Nielsen played for Arizona from 1936 to 1938, and gained the nickname \\"Hoss\\" early in his career. In his first two years, under head coach Tex Oliver, he joined fellow future NFL running back Tom Greenfield as part of a team known as the \\"Blue Brigade\\". The Wildcats had win‚Äìloss records of 7‚Äì2 and 5‚Äì2‚Äì3 in those seasons. Nielsen was named to the Little All-American team in 1937, before a knee injury affected him the next year. In 1939, the Giants selected him with the 10th pick in the NFL Draft, making him the first Wildcats player to be taken in the first round of a draft. Although the Giants signed Nielsen in July 1939, he spent the 1939 season as a member of the minor league Jersey City Giants, reportedly due to a case of hay fever. In 1940, Nielsen rushed for 269 yards in 73 attempts during the nine games he played in, and his average of 3.7 yards per carry was ninth in the NFL. In addition, he caught two passes for 17 yards and scored one touchdown. He accounted for the Giants' first score in a 37‚Äì21 loss to the Chicago Bears on October 27, with a one-yard run. After 1940, Nielsen did not play another NFL game. He participated in World War II; two days after the Normandy landings, he entered France via Omaha Beach. One newspaper reported that Nielsen went on to join \\"in a reconnaissance mission\\", along with \\"driving armored cars ahead of the Allied tanks to scout out Nazi positions.\\" Following a period in \\"private business\\" later in his life, Nielsen died at the age of 89. Nielsen has been named to Arizona's Football Ring of Honor.

The song appeared on the band's 1986 album, Think Visual, and, unlike most other Kinks songs, it was written by Dave Davies rather than his brother, Ray. The track featured former Kinks drummer Mick Avory, despite his being kicked out of the band in 1984 during the Word of Mouth sessions due to conflicts with Dave Davies. This was the last Kinks track Avory performed on. Dave Davies has since praised Avory's drumming on the song, saying, \\"I really liked Mick's drumming on Rock 'n' Roll Cities.\\" Release \\"Rock 'n' Roll Cities\\" was released in November 1986 on the Think Visual LP, where it was the sixth track on the album.

In the video, Ray Davies goes missing, so the rest of the band (including Dave Davies, who is busy with a wife and kids) attempt to find either Ray or a replacement. Ray is found in the end, and after a concert, a groupie is rejected by the \\"family man\\" Dave. Among the many auditioning to replace Ray were people dressed as musicians such as Freddie Mercury and Rick Astley. Also notable is the appearance of the then-departed Mick Avory, who assists the band in their search for Ray. Marina Sirtis, who played Deanna Troi on the television show Star Trek: The Next Generation, made an appearance in the video as Dave Davies's wife. Reception \\"Rock 'n' Roll Cities\\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine in a retrospective review on AllMusic felt the song made the biggest impression. David Wild of Rolling Stone, however, was critical of the song, and wrote: > \\"Rock 'n' Roll Cities\\", the first single from Think Visual, is anything but > a gutsy statement. This utterly uninspired tour song ‚Äî written by Dave > Davies around a woefully tired riff ‚Äî engages in the worst sort of rock > hucksterism. He even resorts to spitting out the names of a few cities, > \\"from Buffalo to the Gulf of Mexico.\\" This is the sort of desperate, > airplay-seeking number that only a radio programmer could love. Author Thomas Kitts said that the song \\"is a delightful spoof not only of touring but of touring songs as well.\\" Ray Davies also had mixed feelings on the song, once stating, \\"When I first heard that song it made me sick.

Biking for Babies has raised more than $100,000 for Pregnancy centers throughout the country. This organization is similar to other charitable bike rides such as the Illini 4000 for Cancer. History The idea for a long-distance bike ride as a fundraiser for pregnant women in need was conceived by Mike Schaefer and Jimmy Becker in the summer of 2008. The organization started as a project of Students for Life of Illinois in 2009 and spun off to become its own non- profit organization in 2011. The first ride was from Carbondale, IL to Chicago, IL. Each year it increased in distance and the next routes started in New Orleans and ended in Chicago. Now there are four routes that begin in separate locations (Green Bay, WI; Columbus, OH; Tylertown, MS; Holly, CO) and all converge in St Louis, MO. The bikers average more than 100 miles per day.

It owns and operates major payment infrastructure in Europe for Euro payments between banks. This includes EURO1 for high value payments system, STEP1, a payment system for single euro payments for small and medium-sized banks, and STEP2, a pan- European automated clearing house (PE-ACH). It also operates the RT1 system for instant payments launched in November 2017. Both EURO1 and STEP2 have been identified as Systemically Important Payment Systems (SIPS) by the European Central Bank. The organisation is based in Paris and has representative offices in Brussels, Frankfurt and Milan. History EBA Clearing was founded in June 1998 by the Euro Banking Association (EBA) and is owned by the major payment banks operating in Europe. Its initial mission was to create and operate the clearing and settlement system for high-value euro transactions, EURO1, which the EBA had transferred to EBA Clearing at the launch of the Eurosystem in 1999. Besides EURO1, EBA Clearing also owns and operates STEP1, a payment system for single euro payments for small and medium-sized banks, and STEP2, a pan-European automated clearing house (PE-ACH) for Euro- denominated retail payments. In March 2013, EBA Clearing launched MyBank, an e-authorisation solution for online payments, which is geared at facilitating the growth of e-commerce across Europe. In October 2017, banks from nine countries agreed to join RT1, EBA Clearing‚Äôs pan-European infrastructure for instant payments in Euro, on its go-live date in November 2017. Payment systems = EURO1 = EURO1 is a RTGS-equivalent large-value payment system that settles single Euro transactions of high priority and urgency, and primarily of large amount. EURO1 operates on a multilateral net basis, meaning that it continuously adjusts the accounts of the participant banks as they make payments for each other's customers. EURO1 is owned and operated by EBA Clearing. It is open to banks that have a registered address or branch in the European Union and fulfil a number of additional requirements. EURO1 is subject to German law (current account principle/single obligation structure) and is based on a messaging and IT infrastructure provided by SWIFT. = STEP1 = Since 2000, EBA Clearing has been offering a payment service named STEP1 for small and medium-sized banks for single euro payments of high priority and urgency. The technical infrastructure is the same as that of the EURO1 system, both use the messaging and IT infrastructure of SWIFT. = STEP2 = STEP2 was put into operation in 2003 with Italian payment system provider SIA S.p.A. It processes mass payments in euros. STEP2 is a pan-European automated clearing house (PE-ACH). This means that it complies with the principles set by the European Payments Council (EPC) for a PE-ACH Compliant Clearing and Settlement System. From the beginning of Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) on 28 January 2008, STEP2 has been offering SEPA Credit Transfer processing services across all SEPA countries. Since 2 November 2009, the transposition date of the Payment Services Directive, EBA Clearing has been processing SEPA Direct Debits with its STEP2 SDD Core and STEP2 SEPA Direct Debit (\\"Business to Business\\") services. Through its SEPA Credit Transfer and Direct Debit offerings, STEP2 provides banks across Europe with one channel through which they can send and receive their SEPA Credit Transfers and SEPA Direct Debits. The STEP2 platform reaches nearly 100 percent of all banks that have signed the SCT and SDD Scheme Adherence Agreements of the European Payments Council (EPC). = MyBank = MyBank is a pan-European e-authorisation and Online Banking ePayments that was launched in March 2013 by EBA Clearing. The solution enables customers across Europe to pay for their online purchases via their regular online or mobile banking environment without having to disclose confidential data to the merchant or other third parties. The solution can be used for authorising SEPA Credit Transfers as well as the creation of SDD mandates. At a later stage, MyBank may also be used for transactions in currencies other than euro or for e-identity services. Today, MyBank is owned and managed by PRETA S.A.S., a wholly owned subsidiary of EBA Clearing. = RT1 = RT1 is an instant payment system that provides the European payments industry with a pan-European infrastructure platform for real-time payments in euro under the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme.

Reid Park is a 131-acre urban park in central Tucson, Arizona that includes a 9,500-seat baseball stadium, an outdoor performance center, two man-made lakes, public pools, and a 24-acre zoo along with playgrounds, gardens and picnic areas. The park occupies the western third of a 480-acre parks and recreation complex established in 1925 as Randolph Park which additionally includes two 18-hole golf courses, a tennis and racquetball facility, and an indoor recreation center. A 2-mile loop of paved multi-use trails follows the edge of the park, connecting with another 2.5 miles around the Randolph golf and recreation centers. History Epes Randolph In 1925 Willis Barnum and his wife paid $14,896 for a 480-acre parcel of land to create a park in what is now central Tucson, deeding it to the city on a long- term purchase agreement. The L-shaped park, which is one mile in width and length with a half-mile-square neighborhood in its northwest corner, was named for prominent railroad executive and Tucson citizen Epes Randolph, who died in 1921. In 1978 the western third of Randolph Park was renamed for the City of Tucson‚Äôs first parks director, Gene C. Reid, upon his retirement. In over thirty years as director Reid expanded Tucson's park system from 8 to 84 parks and made significant additions to Randolf. Reid oversaw the addition of the DeMeester Outdoor Performance Center, the zoo, the expansion and renovation of Randolf Golf Course, and the excavation of two lakes which doubled as irrigation reservoirs. The zoo and lakes also bear Reid's name. The recreation center and golf complex remain named after Randolph. Sports and performance venues =Hi Corbett Field= Randolph Municipal Baseball Park opened in 1928 near Randolph Park's center. A baseball stadium constructed at the site in 1937 was later named for Hiram Corbett, who worked with Cleveland Indians owner Bill Veeck to bring the Indians to Tucson for spring training. The Indians used Hi Corbett Field from 1945 until 1992. From 1969 until 1997, the stadium was also used by the Triple-A Tucson Toros. In 1993 the expansion Colorado Rockies began using the stadium for spring training, staying through 2010. The stadium became home to the University of Arizona Wildcats in 2012. In their first season at Hi Corbett, the Wildcats won the 2012 College World Series. =DeMeester Outdoor Performance Center= left Located on the park's west side, the DeMeester Outdoor Performance Center or OPC is a large grass amphitheater around a covered stage with integrated lighting and sound. Host to open-air concerts, festivals, theater productions, and movie screenings, its official capacity is 7,000. Reid constructed a bandshell at the site in 1964 to give conductor Georges DeMeester's \\"Pops\\" orchestra a permanent home, using surplus corrugated steel from Davis Monthan Air Force Base. The amphitheater was created using dirt from University of Arizona basement excavations. In 1974 the City replaced the original bandshell with the current stage. The performance center was named for DeMeester in 1987. In 1997, the street leading to it was named for Charles \\"Bucky\\" Steele, who conducted the Pops Orchestra for nearly twenty-five years after DeMeester's retirement. The Tucson Pops Music Under the Stars concert series continues to be held at DeMeester Center each spring. A cast-concrete sculpture panel entitled \\"Celebrate The Arts\\" was added to the stage enclosure in 1986. The 8'-by-16' panel by Carole Hanson and Guillermo Esparza depicts six performers: a dancer, an actor with a comedy mask, an actor with a tragedy mask, a singer, a guitarist, and a wind musician. Catalogued in the Smithsonian Art Inventory, the work was the first Percent for the Arts commission in the City of Tucson. Attractions A green aracari at Reid Park Zoo =Reid Park Zoo= Founded in 1965 with the donation of a pair of peacocks, Reid Park Zoo has grown into a 24-acre city-owned non-profit zoo accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Located in the southeast corner of the park, it features more than 100 species and 500 animals. The zoo most recently expanded in 2012 with the addition of a 7-acre African elephant exhibit. Its breeding herd, on loan from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, includes the first African elephant born in the state of Arizona. =Rose Garden= The Reid Park Rose Garden, created in 1960, exhibits more than 100 cultivars of rose and 800 individual plants. Planting beds radiate out from a large gazebo at the garden's center. =Reid Park Lake and Barnum Hill= The park features two man-made man-made lakes, home to a variety of bird life. The north lake, the larger of the two with an area of 2.2 acres, was used for paddle-boating until 1998, when both lakes were dredged and island features were removed. Water pumped to the top of a hill between the lakes feeds two man-made streams: one returns to the north lake via a series of waterfalls, the other winds its way down to the south lake before continuing on to the north. In 1993 the hill was named for Willis E. Barnum who financed the purchase of land for the park in 1925. Sports and recreation facilities =Edith Ball Adaptive Recreation Center= The Adaptive Recreation Center has two swimming pools. One is a shaded outdoor recreation pool used for fitness classes, lap swim, and open swim. The pool includes a walking channel, play features, and a zero-depth entry. The other is an indoor warm-water therapy pool. =Miko's Corner Playground Dog Park= Named after a Tucson Police Department police dog that lost its life in the line of duty, Miko's Corner Playground is a lighted, two-acre, off-leash dog park with separate areas for large and small dogs. =Emil Bossard Annex Fields= Also called the Reid Park Annex, the Emil Bossard Annex Fields are named after a longtime groundskeeper for the Cleveland Indians who retired to Tucson to become groundskeeper for Hi Corbett and the Annex. =Horseshoe Pits= The park's twelve horseshoe pits, home to the Tucson Horseshoe Pitchers' Club, are located on Lakeshore Way at 22nd Street, just south of the zoo. Randolph Park Although the recreation center, tennis center, and golf complex are not officially part of Reid Park, the full complex of facilities located on what was originally Randolph Park is often referred to as a whole using either the Reid or Randolph name. =Randolph Golf Complex= The first golf course in Randolph Park was built in 1925. Now administered by Tucson City Golf, Randolph has two 18-hole golf courses, a driving range, a pro shop, and a clubhouse. In 1996 what until that time was known as Randolph South was rebuilt and named Dell Urich Golf Course. =Randolph Recreation Center= Randolph Recreation Center is located on the west side of Alvernon centered between Broadway and 22nd Street. The facility is equipped with a skate park, a pool, courts configurable for either basketball or volleyball, a weight room, an auditorium, and dedicated classrooms for aerobics, dance, gymnastics, pottery, jewelry-making, and photography. =Jim Reffkin Tennis Center= The Jim Reffkin Tennis Center, located in the northeast corner of the original Randolph Park, has 25 lighted tennis courts, 10 lighted racquetball Courts, and a pro shop. It was honored as the \\"Outstanding Facility of the Year\\" in 1993 by the United States Tennis Association.

To communicate with the main computer system, several forms of communication can be used, including ACPI, SMBus, or shared memory. The embedded controller has its own RAM, independent of that used by the main computer system, and often its own flash ROM on which the controller's software is stored. Many BIOS updates also include upgrades for the embedded controller firmware. An embedded controller is sometimes known as a \\"Keyboard Controller BIOS\\", which comes from the fact that the embedded controller evolved from the keyboard controller and often still is used as a keyboard controller. Even today, an ACPI embedded controller communicates with the CPU by using the same I/O ports that keyboard controllers used in the past. A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) contains an embedded controller that performs cryptographic functions and nothing else.  Ergonomics  Although the embedded controller is very \\"deep\\" in the system, it is important to the user because it performs functions such as fan control and thermal management. Computer systems such as laptops often produce large amounts of heat which must be dissipated. This is typically done by activating a fan to blow air over the components that are producing heat; the fan is not simply turned on or off, but is driven at high speed by the embedded controller for a short time and then left running at low speed until the temperature has decreased sufficiently. Such a control scheme can be uncomfortable from an ergonomic point of view, as the change in fan speed is noticeable to the user, especially if this occurs regularly and if the fan is clearly audible. To prevent this, some embedded controllers are designed to run the fans at a constant speed over a larger range of temperatures and will only increase fan speed when the system is close to overheating. In this case, the ergonomics of the system are improved because the fan is quieter, as it is controlled to rotate at a lower speed and does not change speed as often. However, when the temperature does cross the controller's threshold, it will take much longer to reduce the temperature to safe levels. To change the fan control policy, updates to the embedded controller's firmware are usually necessary. In some systems, fan control is not provided by the embedded controller, but is instead done by a higher-level component such as an ACPI controller. In this case, changing the behaviour of the fan system can be done by the system administrator through ACPI configuration without changing any firmware.

The minnow is named for its mouth. The lower mouth is only partially covered with its lips, leaving part of the minnow's jaw exposed. The mouth is horizontal and small. The minnow has eight dorsal fin-rays, seven anal fin-rays, eight pelvic fin-rays and thirteen to seventeen pectoral fin-rays. Habitat The minnow lives throughout Ontario and the Northeastern United States. In the state of Ohio, the minnow is only confirmed to inhabit the Great Miami and Little Miami rivers. The Ohio population of Exoglossum laurae, which is separated from more Eastern populations by several hundred miles, is considered a subspecies. The minnow is unable to live in murky waters and requires a clean rock river bottom. It also requires a forested river bank. The minnow needs somewhat cool water temperatures to survive. Behavior =Hunting= The minnow has been categorized as an active hunter of prey, meaning that it will actively leave the safety of natural shelter to hunt prey. The hunting may occur alone or in groups. The primary prey of the minnow is aquatic invertebrates. =Reproduction= The minnow reproduces around the month of May. Male minnows construct a nest of pebbles, which are then used to protect spawned eggs. These nests are actively defended by males. Mating likely occurs over an extended period of time as minnow spawn in various stages of development have been observed in the nests. Conservation status Exoglossum laurae has a large population size and is considered common in its range. However, the minnow has experienced habitat loss due to water pollution and the channelization of rivers. The total population of the minnow has declined as a result of these threats. However, it is not deemed to be at risk due to its overall stable population trends and large population size.

It was named by Lawrence Martin of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1911 for Henry Gannett. One arm of the Knik Glacier flows from the ice fields of Mount Gannett's north and east slopes, and the Colony Glacier rises on the west and southwest slopes, flowing into Inner Lake George. In between, the Gannett Glacier flows down a narrow valley northwest of the summit to join the Knik Glacier.
