Peashooting Peashooting (sometimes spelled pea-shooting or pea shooting) is the act of shooting dried peas out of a tube, a peashooter, by blowing through it. A similar effect can be achieved by using small bits of paper instead of peas. A sport has developed around pea shooting, in which peas are shot into a target, similar to those used for archery.

In 1867, Elizabeth took over as head of the school and remained so until 1868. In 1869, in Madison County, she opened a school that she operated from 1869 until 1873. In the later year, she and her family returned to Huntsville, and her husband joined in a law practice there. Elizabeth remained active in the community and with her growing family. In 1877, Governor Richard B. Hubbard appointed her husband superintendent of the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville, at which post he served for the next fourteen years. Elizabeth worked with the prisoners in many capacities. She ran the prison Sunday school and learned Spanish so that she could teach the Mexican-American prisoners. According to one obituary, she also attended every funeral at the prison, often as the only mourner. In 1879, Sam Houston Normal Institute was established in Huntsville, replacing Andrew Female College. Elizabeth, a lifelong advocate of higher education, had promoted the new college. On the day of the formal opening, the Gorees entertained the school officials and the visiting dignitaries in their home.

Early career  Cooper was born at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, England. He was educated at Clifton College, \\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. ref no 9776: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and then at Keble College, Oxford, where he was an organ scholar. During the 1930s he worked initially as a church organist and piano teacher before joining the GPO Film Unit, where he wrote incidental music for documentaries, including Mony a Pickle (1938) and A Midsummer Day's Work (1939). Here his colleagues included the poet W. H. Auden and the composer Benjamin Britten. He had already embarked on a promising career as a concert pianist when the outbreak of World War II forced him to give up the concert platform for the duration of hostilities. He resumed his career in 1946, studying briefly with Egon Petri and making his London debut in 1947. As a concert pianist, Cooper made a number of successful recordings (including some for the World Record Club), and also began broadcasting on radio. In 1946 he assisted Ralph Vaughan Williams in arranging the latter's Piano Concerto for two pianos.  Broadcasting comp√®re  In 1954 he accepted an invitation to work on the BBC radio quiz show Call the Tune. In 1966 the show transferred to television under the title Face the Music. Transmitted on BBC2 and repeated on BBC1, it ran until 1979 and was briefly revived in 1983-4. The show kept Cooper in the public eye, and the \\"Hidden Melody\\" round, a regular feature of the show in which he improvised in the style of a composer and cloaked a well-known tune in his elaborate extemporization, served as a vehicle for his great pianistic talent. Face the Music also featured the Dummy Keyboard, in which Cooper played a well-known piano piece on a silent keyboard and the panel had to identify it. The music was gradually faded in for viewers at home. The panellists included Joyce Grenfell, Robin Ray (who had an encyclopedic memory for opus numbers, etc.), and occasionally Bernard Levin. Cooper's brilliance with Face the Music was captured on a recording by leading UK record label, CRD Records Ltd, which was released in 1973. During the 1960s, Cooper occasionally appeared as one of the presenters of Here Today, a daily 15-minute light current affairs programme broadcast by the independent company TWW, which served South Wales and the West of England. He became known for his acerbic, rather irascible interviewing style and for the fact that he regularly played out the programme with a gentle piano piece. Cooper was awarded the OBE in 1982. He was married twice, first to Jean Greig from 1947 until her death in 1973, and then Carol Borg, from 1975 until her death in 1996.

KDM is a common intermediate representation for existing software systems and their operating environments, that defines common metadata required for deep semantic integration of Application Lifecycle Management tools. KDM was designed as the OMG's foundation for software modernization, IT portfolio management and software assurance. KDM uses OMG's Meta-Object Facility to define an XMI interchange format between tools that work with existing software as well as an abstract interface (API) for the next-generation assurance and modernization tools. KDM standardizes existing approaches to knowledge discovery in software engineering artifacts, also known as software mining. History * In November 2003, the OMG's Architecture-Driven Modernization Task Force recommended, and the Platform Technical Committee issued, the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) RFP. The objective of this RFP was to provide a common repository structure to represent information about existing software assets and their operating environment. The goal of KDM was defined as exchanging information related to transformation of existing software assets. The RFP stated that KDM shall provide the ability to document existing systems, discover reusable components in existing software, support transformations to other languages and to MDA, or enable other potential transformations. The Knowledge Discovery Metamodel will also enable information about existing software artifacts to be exchanged among different tools. This will enable vendors that specialize on certain languages, platforms or types of transformations to deliver customer solutions in conjunction with other vendors. * The original KDM RFP is available to OMG members for download. * Throughout 2004 and 2005 12 companies collaborated to prepare a joint response to the KDM RFP. More than 30 organizations from 5 countries have contributed to the development and review of the KDM specification. * In May 2006, the Team's submission‚Äîthe Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) -- moved into the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The OMG adopted Specification for KDM became publicly available (OMG document ptc/06-06-07). * In March 2007 the KDM Finalization Task Force finished the finalization stage of the OMG's standards adoption process. The formal KDM specification KDM 1.0 is available from OMG. * The latest version of the spec was finalized in July 2011, making KDM 1.3 the most recent version. * KDM Analytics maintains open portal for KDM news, reference and education materials and tools Overview The goal of KDM is to ensure interoperability between tools for maintenance, evolution, assessment and modernization. KDM is defined as a metamodel that can be also viewed as an ontology for describing the key aspects of knowledge related to the various facets of enterprise software. KDM support means investment into the KDM ecosystem ‚Äì a growing open-standard based cohesive community of tool vendors, service providers, and commercial components. KDM represents entire enterprise software systems, not just code. KDM is a wide-spectrum entity-relationship representation for describing existing software. KDM represents structural and behavior elements of existing software systems. The key concept of KDM is a container: an entity that owns other entities. This allows KDM to represent existing systems at various degrees of granularity. KDM defines precise semantic foundation for representing behavior, the so-called micro-KDM. It provides a high-fidelity intermediate representation which can be used, for example, for performing static analysis of existing software systems. micro- KDM is similar in purpose to a virtual machine for KDM, although KDM is not an executable model, or a constraint model, but a representation of existing artifacts for analysis purposes. KDM facilitates incremental analysis of existing software systems, where the initial KDM representation is analyzed and more pieces of knowledge are extracted and made explicit as KDM to KDM transformation performed entirely within the KDM technology space. The steps of the knowledge extraction process can be performed by tools, and may involve the analyst. KDM is the uniform language- and platform- independent representation. Its extensibility mechanism allows addition of domain-, application- and implementation-specific knowledge. Architecture Knowledge Discovery Metamodel consists of 12 packages arranged into 4 layers. KDM packages are arranged into the following four layers: =Infrastructure Layer= The KDM Infrastructure Layer consists of the Core, kdm, and Source packages which provide a small common core for all other packages, the inventory model of the artifacts of the existing system and full traceability between the meta-model elements as links back to the source code of the artifacts, as well as the uniform extensibility mechanism. The Core package determines several of the patterns that are reused by other KDM packages. Although KDM is a meta-model that uses Meta-Object Facility, there is an alignment between the KDM Core and Resource Description Framework (RDF). =Program Elements Layer= The Program Elements Layer consists of the Code and Action packages. * The Code package represents programming elements as determined by programming languages, for example data types, procedures, classes, methods, variables, etc. This package is similar in purpose to the Common Application Meta-model (CAM) from another OMG specification, called Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). KDM Code package provides greater level of detail and is seamlessly integrated with the architecturally significant views of the software system. Representation of datatypes in KDM is aligned with ISO standard ISO/IEC 11404 (see also General Purpose Datatypes). * The Action package captures the low level behavior elements of applications, including detailed control- and data flow between statements. Code and Action package in combination provide a high-fidelity intermediate representation of each component of the enterprise software system =Resource Layer= The Resource Layer represents the operational environment of the existing software system. It is related to the area of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). * Platform package represents the operating environment of the software, related to the operating system, middleware, etc. including the control flows between components as they are determined by the runtime platform * UI package represents the knowledge related to the user interfaces of the existing software system * Event package represents the knowledge related to events and state-transition behavior of the existing software system * Data package represents the artifacts related to persistent data, such as indexed files, relational databases, and other kinds of data storage. These assets are key to enterprise software as they represent the enterprise metadata. The KDM Data package is aligned with another OMG specification, called Common Warehouse Metamodel (CWM) =Abstractions Layer= The Abstraction Layer represents domain and application abstractions. * Conceptual package represent business domain knowledge and business rules, insofar as this information can be mined from existing applications. These packages are aligned with another OMG specification, called Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules (SBVR) * Structure package describes the meta- model elements for representing the logical organization of the software system into subsystems, layers and components * Build package represents the engineering view of the software system See also *Object Management Group *Software Metrics Metamodel is a metric specification that is based on the KDM References External links * OMG KDM Specification * Object Management Group (OMG) * Open KDM portal and tools from KDM Analytics * OMG Architecture- Driven Modernization Task Force * DSTC initial submission * SBVR link * Software Hypermodel Blueprint Portal for Open Source Software - TSRI's instantiations of ASTM+KDM+SMM * Open Source Components from MoDisco Eclipse project Category:Software architecture Category:Domain-specific knowledge representation languages Category:ISO standards ","title":"Knowledge Discovery Metamodel"},{"id":"10482733","text":"Oil Can Henry's was an oil-change shop based in Tualatin, Oregon, United States.Oil Can Henry's franchise statistics Prior to being bought by Ashland Inc. in 2015, the company operated as a franchisor, and had locations in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California, Arizona, Colorado and Minnesota.

History A franchise in Hillsboro, Oregon, featuring the company's standard architectural style Oil Can Henry's was founded in 1978 by Marshall Stevens, a Tigard, Oregon, real estate developer. In 1988, the Shepanek family and friends purchased the company for $340,000, while Stevens continued to own franchises. Then named OCH International, the company began selling franchises in 1989. Sales at the company grew to $15 million in 1996. The company was the nation's 18th largest oil change company in 1997. That year Oil Can Henry's signed a deal with Valvoline that included loan guarantees, payments to franchisees to help cover start-up costs, and a discount on oil. By April 2007, the company had grown to 67 locations, with ten of those as company-owned shops. Stevens had to sell 12 of 14 of his locations in 1991 due to financial problems.

The tax would pay for a $198 million, 1,800 bed adult detention facility, $11 million juvenile detention facility expansion of 50 beds, a $2 million Hamilton County Justice Center remodeling and other programs that altogether totaled $736 million over 15 years.

On November 6, 2007, Hamilton County voters of rejected the sales tax increase by more than a 12% margin.

The ballot initiative would allow the voters to decide on an amendment to the city charter prohibiting local officials from ever installing either red light cameras or speed cameras. In November 2008, a majority of Cincinnati voters approved the amendment to the city charter prohibiting the use of red light cameras.

It is one of only three remaining 'barn' churches in Ireland built during penal times, a time when Roman Catholics were not allowed practice their religion. In 1828 Daniel O'Connell, an MP for County Clare who would later go on to be known as The Liberator, made a speech outside the church about the Catholic Emancipation Act, arguing that Catholic Members of Parliament should be allowed take their seat once elected, which was forbidden at that time. The quaint country church is popular for weddings, and a number of celebrity weddings have been held here, including that of Sharon Corr, of the musical group The Corrs.  Cratloe Grotto  A short distance away is Cratloe Grotto, which is maintained by the parish. Work on the Cratloe Grotto began in 1928 and was opened in 1932 after the initiative of Fr. John Wallace, P.P. The 100 foot climb up to the Grotto itself includes the Stations of the Cross on either side of the path. The grotto was designed as a replica of the grotto at Lourdes.

Christianity was introduced to the island in first century, probably in AD 72. Traditionally, after Thomas the Apostle's visit in Kerala in AD 52, Christianity is said to have been introduced via India because of its close geographical and commercial ties. According to Christian traditions, the apostle Thomas preached the Gospel in Sri Lanka. Records suggest that St. Thomas Christians and Nestorian Christians lived in Sri Lanka. Anuradhapura cross is one of the archaeological claims that suggest Christianity in Sri Lanka before the Portuguese. Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Portuguese in 1505. There were conversions by Dutch persons in the 17th century, which resulted in a percentage of church members in excess of 10%. The Christian population of Sri Lanka includes members of both the Sinhalese and Tamil ethnic groups.  Roman Catholicism  6.19% of the population (1,261,194 persons) is Roman Catholic, according to the 2012 census. Roman Catholicism thus constitutes approximately 83.5% of the Christian population as of census day 2012. Catholicism was first introduced by the Portuguese, who left a notable mark in that Portuguese surnames are still used by many Catholics. Dutch missionaries tried to spread Protestantism after the Portuguese were expelled, but most Sri Lankan Christians are now Catholics. There is a Roman Catholic archbishop and 11 Roman Catholic bishops. The dioceses are: # Archdiocese of Colombo # Diocese of Anuradhapura # Diocese of Badulla # Diocese of Batticaloa # Diocese of Chilaw # Diocese of Galle # Diocese of Jaffna # Diocese of Kandy # Diocese of Kurunegala # Diocese of Mannar # Diocese of Ratnapura # Diocese of Trincomalee  Protestantism  290,967 persons in Sri Lanka (1.43%) are Protestants as per the 2012 census. The Ceylon Pentecostal Mission has about 16,500 church members and 70 churches (faith homes) in Sri Lanka. About 2000 people (1998) are affiliated with congregations belonging to the Baptist World Alliance. The Lanka Lutheran Church has about 1,200 members. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints claims 1,200 members in Sri Lanka.LDS Newsroom (Statistical Information)Sri Lanka ‚Äì LDS Newsroom The main Protestant churches in Sri Lanka are Anglican, Methodist, Baptist and Salvation Army. The Church of Ceylon is an extra-provincial Anglican church, and the Church of South India (a united church of Anglicans, Presbyterians, and other Protestants) is a full member of the Anglican Communion and has a diocese in Jaffna. The Anglican Church has a strong effect on people in some areas. Methodist missionaries established 187 schools of which only 2 remains (Wesley College and Methodist College) because all the other schools were taken over by the government. Methodism has over 40,000 followers in Sri Lanka with 45 circuits, 200 churches and 120 pastors. Moratuwa Area and Kutunayake Negombo Areas are the regions where many Methodists live. In 2005 and 2006, the Methodist Church of Sri Lanka had a very difficult time during a period of anti-Christian violence. St. Andrew's Church in Colombo is a congregation of the Church of Scotland. For administrative purposes, it is part of the Church of Scotland's International Presbytery. According to the 2002 yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, around 4,019 active members are in Sri Lanka. = Lutheranism = The Ceylon Evangelical Lutheran Church is a confessional Lutheran Church in Sri Lanka, and the only Lutheran denomination registered with the Sri Lankan government.Public Records of the Registrar of Societies, Sri Lanka, registered under Company Registration No. GA 135, an Association within the meaning of section 34 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. The Church consists of more than a dozen congregations or mission stations, mainly concentrated in the tea plantation regions of Nuwara Eliya, Central Province.  History  Originally named the Lutheran Church in Lanka, leadership of the Church was assumed by missionaries of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS) in 2015, and the name was officially changed to the Ceylon Evangelical Lutheran Church in February 2017.Public Records of the Registrar of Societies, Sri Lanka. The first pastor ordained into the CELC was Rev. P. Gnanakumar, who had served as a vicar in the Lanka Lutheran Church for more than a decade, and was ordained on 2 September 2017 by Rev. Charles Ferry, the LCMS regional director for Asia. On the same day, Rev. Dr. Edward Naumann, LCMS Theological Educator for South Asia, launched the Church's official publishing house, the Ceylon Evangelical Lutheran Publishing House (CELPH). In October 2017 all three pastors of the Lanka Lutheran Church, Rev. Nadaraja, Rev. Arulchelvan, and Rev. Devanesanin, applied and were accepted for membership of the CELC Ministerium, bringing the total number of Sri Lankan pastors to four.  Church structure  The CELC Church Order provides for an episcopal polity, which is not considered to be a point of doctrine, as the Church works closely with the LCMS, which maintains a congregational polity. Currently no bishop has been elected, so the Church is administered by the CELC Board of Directors.  Relationship with other Lutheran bodies  The Ceylon Evangelical Lutheran Church is a member of the International Lutheran Council, but has no official relationship with the Lutheran World Federation. On 26 September 2018, the International Lutheran Council received the CELC as a full member, thus bringing international recognition to the CELC. According to its governing Church Order, the CELC classifies all clergy of the LCMS and churches in communion with the LCMS as 'recognized clergy' who are subsequently granted permission to conduct Word and Sacrament ministry in CELC congregations.

It is within the townland of Cloghreagh.Ordnance Survey Ireland: Online map viewer (choose \\"historic\\" to see townland boundaries) The area derives its name from the large number of mills, mainly Linen that were set up in the early 19th century. The Camlough River here provided a quick source of power through water wheels. Most of these have been now demolished, the latest being Baillies Foundry. This was an impressive ruin. A six-storey granite building, originally constructed in 1800 or so. This fell derelict in the late 1960s. Up to its recent demolition it still contained the rusting ruins of all its lathes and machinery. Places of interest *The main claim to fame of the area is the local public house, the Millvale Arms. This is locally known as the Pit. The story goes that in the late 19th century a cock pit existed to the rear of the pub. Here locals made bets on cockerels fighting in an enclosed pit, thus the name. The Quaker community who set up the neighbouring village of Bessbrook, had a policy called the three P's Policy. This meant, no Pubs, no Police, or no Pawn Shops in the village. As such the Pub in nearby Millvale which was just outside Bessbrook fared very well. *The Old Beetle Mill at Millvale crossroads which was built in 1795 does however remain. This building still stands proud despite closing in 1940.- This was passed for some sort of housing project at the height of the Irish Property Market Bubble, however the project failed and the Mill is starting to deteriorate very badly- The heavy snow falls in Winter 2010 have wreaked havoc on the roof and it is a dangerous place to go near ‚Äì especially in stormy weather *Millvale is also well associated with railway history, the 18 arch viaduct of the main Belfast to Dublin railway line is one of the most prominent features of the area (see Craigmore Viaduct). Local legend is that one construction worker died for each arch on the project. *The Doctors Hill in Millvale is also well known. The large old house that stands at the bottom was originally the local Doctors Surgery. *During The Troubles in Northern Ireland, 4 Policemen were killed near the Millvale Crossroads by a remote controlled bomb on 17 April 1979. IRA member Francis Jordan was also killed there in 1975 * A Doctors Surgery was built here in 1848, and the Doctors' Hill name was born, used to be called County Road, and the main road on the cross roads was changed.

He served one term as Arizona Territory's delegate in the United States House of Representatives and was elected twice, but served only once, to represent Yavapai County in the council (upper house) of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Despite his service in the United States Congress, it is unclear as to whether he was ever a United States citizen. Background Campbell was born on June 25, 1827 to Agnes (Hunter) and Robert Campbell in Glasgow, Scotland. He immigrated to the United States with his father in 1841, entering the country at New York City. Shortly after his arrival, Campbell was apprenticed to a baker in Detroit. He also attended night classes to supplement his education. Returning to New York City in 1846, Campbell worked as a baker until 1848. In 1849 Campbell set out for California, traveling via Vera Cruz and Mazatl√°n before reaching the confluence of the Colorado and Gila rivers in July. From there he continued to San Francisco before proceeding to the Yuba River. Campbell began working as a miner in Yuba County, California in 1850. Two years later he turned to cattle ranching in the Shasta Valley. In 1854, Campbell opened a general store in Trinity County, California. Campbell moved to Chile in 1857 where he worked as a merchant. Civil unrest in 1859 prompted Campbell's return to the United States. Upon his return, Campbell became manager of Los Angeles' LaFayette Hotel for a time before returning to San Francisco. In early 1863, Campbell went to El Dorado Canyon in Nevada. There he built a raft and took the Colorado River south to La Paz, Arizona Territory, arriving in December. During the territorial census in 1864, Campbell was found to own US$500 in property. In late 1864, he moved to Prescott and settled there for the rest of his life. Shortly after his arrival, Campbell opened a general store. In the early 1870s, Campbell partnered with William Buffum. Beginning in 1868 Campbell diversified into ranching where he partnered with James M. Baker. By 1872, Campbell and Baker owned over 1,000 cattle and were raising sheep in the Chino Valley. Buffum and Campbell ended their partnership in 1876 with both men continuing in the mercantile business. Campbell was married twice. His first nuptial was a common law marriage to a Chilean lady named Carmelita. The union produced one daughter and ended after she filed for divorce in January 1878. The second marriage came on May 20, 1880 when Campbell wed Marguerite Maleziex of Paris, France. The couple had six children: Antoinette (died at 10 days of age), Frank R., John G. (died age 16), Agnes, Louise M., and Lilly Belle. Political career Besides his business interests Campbell was also active in politics. He was elected to the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors with a term running from January 1, 1867 to December 31, 1868. He became the board chairman on December 14, 1867. Campbell was elected to a second term in the early 1870s. He did not complete his second term, resigning before the August 5, 1872 board meeting. Campbell was elected to represent Yavapai County in the council (upper house) of the 5th Arizona Territorial Legislature but did not attend the session. He was nominated by the Democratic party for a seat on the Council in 1872 but lost the election by a vote of 260 to 369. Two years later he ran again and won a seat on the Council in the 8th Arizona Territorial Legislature. In 1876, Campbell made an unsuccessful run for County Treasurer. In April 1878, Campbell announced his intention to run for Territorial Delegate. While nominally a Democrat, he ran as an Independent. His opponents were Republican Hiram S. Stevens, the incumbent, Democrat King Woolsey, and Independent Republican A. E. Davis. The campaign was dominated by the candidates' personalities and mud slinging. Campbell positioned himself as a \\"free and Independent\\" candidate capable of serving the interests of Arizona residents. In its endorsement for Campbell, the Arizona Daily Miner wrote, \\"His earthly possessions are in Arizona, and on the principle that, 'where our treasures are, there will our hearts be also.' he is strictly and emphatically an Arizonan.\\" The November 5, 1878 election saw Campbell win with 1,484 votes compared to 1,258 for Stevens, 1,207 for Davis, and 915 for Woolsey. Claims of election fraud followed Campbell's victory, with the candidate being accused of using livestock, whiskey, and cash to buy the votes of \\"all who were willing to sacrifice their manhood for such trash.\\" It was further accused that a Catholic priest in Yuma \\"was out electioneering and walking his subjects to the polls as he would drive so many sheep, and all in the interest of 'our' Campbell.\\" Judge Charles Silent oversaw a grand jury investigation that found insufficient evidence to issue any indictments. Campbell made a business stop in San Francisco and visited family in Brooklyn, New York before the 46th United States Congress began on March 18, 1879. In addition to the normal introductions to other members of Congress, the new delegate gave a presentation on the situation in Arizona to 150 potential immigrants to the territory on April 6, 1879. He introduced a variety of petitions and about 18 bills during his term including a bill to repeal the tariffs on movable type and paper. Campbell's only appearance in the Congressional Record came during a debate about which committee should handle a bill he introduced to allow the territorial legislature to override a veto. When asked to which committee the bill should be referred, he stated \\"I have no particular choice about the reference.\\" By the time the election of 1880 began, both the Democrats and Republicans were better organized within Arizona and each held their first successful territorial nominating conventions. When Campbell arrived at the Democratic convention, he was ill and as a result confined to his hotel room. While his name was entered into consideration it became quickly apparent that he lacked the support to win nomination and he withdrew from consideration. Campbell considered running for another political office in 1882 but decided against doing so. With the inauguration of President Grover Cleveland in 1885, Campbell submitted an application to become Arizona Territorial Governor but was not selected. Later life Campbell returned to his mercantile business after leaving office. He also was active in other business ventures, joining with other prominent Arizonans in the mid-1880s as a promoter for the Prescott and Arizona Central Railway which sought to build a north‚Äìsouth rail line within Arizona. In 1894, Campbell sold his store and used the proceeds to build a hotel in Prescott, the Depot House. He operated the hotel until 1901 when declining health forced his retirement. On June 9, 1891, Campbell filed a claim for reparations for losses he had suffered during an Indian raid in November 1868. When the case came before the United States Court of Claims, he was asked for proof he was United States citizen. Campbell assumed he had become a citizen automatically when his father was naturalized following their migration from Scotland. He was unable however to find any record of his father's naturalization. With Campbell unable to establish his citizenship, the court denied his claim. The matter would not be finally settled until after Campbell's death. In 1912, Representative Carl Hayden introduced legislation to provide relief to Campbell's heirs. Hayden's argument was \\"One who has served in the House of Representatives ought to be presumed to be a citizen of the United States.\\" The legislation was not passed until 1915 with the Court of Claims taking until February 19, 1917 to approve payment of US$470 in reparations. Campbell died in Prescott on December 22, 1903. He was buried in Prescott's Mountain View Cemetery.

It was a bread that was small enough to be held in the hand or glove (see also manchette). History One of the first recipes printed in English for manchet breads comes from 1588 and the recipe book The Good Huswifes Handmaide by an unknown author. In it the author explains that the flour must be fine and have been \\"boulted\\" twice. There are several recipes for manchets mentioned in Florence White's classic English cuisine book Good Things in England first published in 1932. She gives five regional varieties of the bread and quotes from sources for the recipes. The first is from Gervase Markham in Nottinghamshire published in 1615 where White quotes an anonymous source that describes a manchet as 'Your best and principal bread'.Florence White: Good Things in England published by English Folk Cookery Association 1932 Jonathan Cape 1968 page 71 There is also a reference to \\"Manchetts for the Queen's Maides\\", a royal ordinance originating from Eltham Palace in 1526 during Henry VIII's reign which describes a menu for medieval aristocracy.Harleian manuscript No 642 British Museum It is inserted because a correspondent had requested when manchets were to be served at court. This suggests that in origin it was a luxurious bread containing ingredients that were available only to the wealthy. The most superior wheat for a manchet was said to come from Heston, near Hounslow during the reign of Elizabeth I.Katharine E.

Cardamine diphylla is a spring woodland plant that is found in most of eastern North America. Distribution Its habitat ranges from Georgia north to Ontario and from the Atlantic to Wisconsin. It is found in moist woodlands usually in edge habitats and blooms from April to June. A member of the mustard family, it is typified by a four petal flower which blooms in a cluster on a single stalk above a single pair of toothed stem leaves each divided into three broad leaflets. After flowering, narrow seedpods appear just below the flower cluster. It grows approximately 30 cm (12 in) tall. Butterfly habitat The West Virginia white butterfly (Pieris virginiensis) lays its eggs on this plant as well as C. laciniata. The larvae also feed on this plant. As with Pieris oleracea, Pieris virginiensis mistakes garlic mustard for its host plants, making eradication of it important for their continued survival. Garlic mustard also competes with the plants for space and nutrients.Becker, R., Gerber E., Hinz H., Katovich E., Panke B., Reardon R., Renz R., Van Riper L., 2013.

Their host facility was the Desert Schools Coyotes Center in Chandler, Arizona. The Polar Bears were a member of the Western States Hockey League but vacated their membership in the league when the WSHL moved away from USA Hockey sanctioning in 2011. History The Phoenix Polar Bears were formed as an expansion team by Harry Mahood for the Western States Hockey League in 1999. Until 2009, Mahood operated as the owner, general manager, and head coach of the Polar Bears and became one of the most successful franchises in the WSHL under his tenure. In 2011, the Polar Bears left the WSHL when the league dropped their USA Hockey membership and joined the United Hockey Union. After folding, the franchise was sold and their WSHL membership license was transferred to Arizona Hockey Club, Inc. to create the Phoenix Knights junior hockey team. In 2003, the team won the USA Hockey Tier III Junior B National Championship, beating the St. Louis Jr. Blues, 1‚Äì0, after a perfect regular season record of 47‚Äì0. In 2002 and 2004, the team won a silver medal at the USA Hockey Junior B National Tournament. In 2004, the Polar Bears received the National Fair Play Award at the National Tournament. Under Mahood, the Phoenix Polar Bears recorded 575 wins, seven WSHL Thorne Cup Championships, nine consecutive National Tournament appearances, three undefeated seasons in WSHL play, one nationally undefeated season in 2003, the 2004 National Fair Play award and graduated over 170 players to all levels of NHL, NCAA, CIAU, minor professional, major junior, and ACHA hockey. Concurrently, the Phoenix Polar Bears raised several hundred thousands of dollars for Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, American Heart Association, Phoenix Thunderbirds, Child Find, American Red Cross and various other community programs and charities. Alumni Among the many alumni to play college and advanced levels of junior and major junior hockey, including: *Dusty Collins, a local Phoenix born player drafted to the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2005 and enjoyed a short career in the minors before retiring. * Tyler Haskins from Ohio who was drafted to the Detroit Red Wings in 2005 and a captain for EHC Wolfsburg in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. *Jeremy Langlois, a Tempe, Arizona-native who played college hockey at Quinnipiac University and signed an NHL tryout contract with the San Jose Sharks. Youth hockey Initially, the youth hockey program at Polar Ice, Peoria, Polar Ice Chandler and Polar Ice Gilbert were named after this team and were called the Jr. Polar Bears. They had teams ranging from Mites to Midget and competed annually across the United States. Championships The Polar Bears have won seven Thorne Cups, awarded to the WSHL playoff champions in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2010.

Visitors may take a moderate- difficulty ¬æ-mile (1.2 km) trail to the falls. As with all waterfalls, hikers must exercise caution. While the area around the bottom of the falls is flat and generally not dangerous, unofficial paths lead to the top of the falls and are treacherous.

Role in the appointment of Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan's interim leader In November 2001 a multiparty agreement, in Bonn, Germany, lead to the appointment of Hamid Karzai as leader of the Afghan Transitional Administration. The parties in Bonn included several of Afghanistan's militia leaders, commonly called \\"warlords\\". According to Swan Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was one of the Bonn attendees.

Bush. Chief of Afghan Intelligence for Khost Swar Khan worked for a former anti-Taliban militia leader named Malem Jan Sorbari. He attributed his denunciation, and transportation to Guantanamo to bad blood triggered by a rivalry between the former militia leaders he worked under and Majah Ha Adrif. According to Swar Khan his immediate boss, Mustafa, had been appointed the Police Chief of Khost, while a different authority had appointed Majah Ha Adrif in charge of Afghan intelligence in Khost. Swar Khan told his Combatant Status Review Tribunal that Mustafa's forces fought with Majah Ha Adrif's forces over who had jurisdiction over the security of the areas surrounding the US bases in Khost. Many innocent people were killed during this fighting. Swar Khan said one of Majah Ha Adrif's subordinates, named Habib Noor, falsely denounced him, and triggered his capture by the American, due to the animosity arising from the jurisdictional dispute. Majah Ha Adrif's death According to Swar Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was shot at an American roadblock: :\\"Maja Han Adroft(ph) ' was very trusted by the Americans. He went with the Americans to the German city of Bonn, to a meeting. He has a picture with Bush and shook hands with Bush. In a checkpoint, he probably took money from someone. But, the Americans shot him and killed him.\\" References Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Afghan politicians ","title":"Majah Ha Adrif"},{"id":"10483292","text":"Les Forgerons (also known as The Blacksmiths) is an 1895 French short black- and-white silent documentary film directed and produced by Louis Lumi√®re.

(2003, ) is the first book in the Hank Zipzer series, written by Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver, illustrated by Jesse Joshua Watson and published by Grosset & Dunlap. Plot summary Hank starts a new year at his school and meets his new teacher, who has her students write an essay about their summer vacations. Hank has a hard time with homework and with staying on task, thus making his essay a difficult assignment. Meanwhile, his grandpa, Papa Pete, asks Hank and his friends Ashley Wong and Frankie Townsend (the Magik 3, the name Hank gave to himself and his friends) to put on a magic show at his bowling league game. However, his teacher made a statement to Hank saying she can't wait to see his creative report, so he has to do his report and perform for Papa Pete. Hank decides to make a model of Niagara Falls - the place where he spent his vacation - rather than write about it, but when he presents the project in class, he accidentally floods the classroom. Hank is given two weeks of punishment at school and at home. His punishment includes not being able to participate in the magic show for Papa Pete's bowling league. Finally, after a lot of convincing, his parents allow him to do the magic show. It was a relief to all the people at the bowling alley because class bully and overall idiot Nick McKelty was performing in the Magik 3's place. The magic show happens, and McKelty gets laughed at for his lame performance and thrown off stage, where the Magik 3 performs a great magic trick and the audience applauds. In the end, things go well for Hank, as he also meets the new music teacher, Mr. Rock, during detention, and they instantly like each other.

After several years immersed in the UK indie scene, Morgan's musical direction changed considerably with the advent of house music in the late 1980s. In 1988, Morgan moved to Chicago and started writing with Kym Mazelle and Marshall Jefferson on Kym's first album, \\"Crazy\\", which was released the following year. In 1989, Morgan joined his third band, the Manic MCs who had a UK top thirty hit with their first release, \\"Mental\\". In 1990, Morgan started collaborating with BTech record's Jan Ekholm after being introduced by DJ/Production duo Quartz, working in Sweden on a series of Dance releases under various pseudonyms, including Technoir, Backbeat, Groovement, Bassrace and others. \\"Clubland\\" originally formed by Dave Rawlings and Ronnie Herel of Quartz with Jan Ekholm. During the first album Quartz left and the two remaining members were joined by Zemya Hamilton on vocals.

She lived all her life in Cambridge and Boston. Writing in 1917, W.E.B. Du Bois claimed she had achieved the greatest distinction in education to that time of any African-American not working in segregated schools. Biography Baldwin was born to Peter L. and Mary E. Baldwin in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She received all of her education in the city's public schools. In 1874, Baldwin graduated from Cambridge High School and a year later from the Cambridge training school for teachers. Despite her obvious talents as a teacher, she was not hired by the Cambridge public schools but instead first taught in a segregated school in Chestertown Maryland. After her father's death in 1880, she returned to Cambridge. Protests from the Cambridge African American community then led to her being hired to teach at the Agassiz school, a well regarded public school attended by middle class white children. She was clearly an outstanding educator and in 1889 was appointed principal, the first African-American female principal in Massachusetts and the Northeast. As principal, Baldwin supervised white faculty and a predominantly white student body. In 1916 when a new Agassiz school was erected, Baldwin was made master. She was one of only two women in the Cambridge school system who held the position of master and the only African American in New England to hold such a position. Baldwin served as principal and master of Agassiz school for forty years. Under her leadership, it became one of the best schools in the city, attended by children of Harvard professors and many of the old Cambridge families. She introduced new methods of teaching mathematics and began art classes. She was the first to introduce the practice of hiring a school nurse. Her school was the only one in the city of Cambridge to establish an \\"open-air\\" classroom. Poet E. E. Cummings was one of her students and described her thus in his book Six Nonlectures: > Miss Baldwin, the dark lady mentioned in my first nonlecture (and a lady if > ever a lady existed) was blessed with a delicious voice, charming manners, > and a deep understanding of children. Never did any demidivine dictator more > gracefully and easily rule a more unruly and less graceful populace. Her > very presence emanated an honour and a glory: the honour of spiritual > freedom‚Äînot mere freedom from‚Äîand the glory of being, not (like most extant > mortals) really undead but actually alive. From her I marvellingly learned > that the truest power is gentleness. She lectured widely to both Euro-American and African American organizations. Her best-known presentation was her lecture on Harriet Beecher Stowe, which she first delivered as the Annual Washington's Birthday celebration at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in 1897. She was the first African American and the first woman to be invited to present this annual lecture. She also taught summer courses for teachers at the Hampton Institute in Virginia and the Institute for Colored Youth in Cheyney, Pennsylvania and was a supporter of Charlotte Hawkins Brown's Palmer Institute in Sedalia, North Carolina. Her home was the central meeting place for the African American community. Beginning in the early 1890s she led a literary group for black Harvard students, among them William Monroe Trotter, William Lewis, and W.E.B. DuBois. She also organized and led the Omar Khayyam Circle, a black literary and intellectual group. Notable members included Clement G. Morgan, William Monroe Trotter, and others who became active in working for civil rights. She belonged to numerous civic and educational organizations, both black and white. Among the white-dominated organizations were the Twentieth Century Club, the Cantabrigia Club, and the Boston Ethical Society. She was also a leader of the black community. In 1893, along with her close friends Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and Flora Ruffin Ridley she founded the Woman's Era Club, one of the first African American women's clubs. The club published The Woman's Era the first periodical published by black women. She was a member of the board of directors and in 1903 was elected President of the Boston Literary and Historical Association, an organization of leading black activists who supported black civil rights. She was one of the first women members of the Niagara Movement and a member of the Committee of Forty which organized the founding of the NAACP. Baldwin was an advocate of woman suffrage. She was also an early member of the board of the Boston Branch of the NAACP. She was active in supporting the Robert Gould Shaw House, a settlement house in South Boston. During the First World War, she was central in founding the Soldiers Comfort Unit, which supported black soldiers stationed at Fort Devens. After the war, the group changed its name to the League of Women for Community Service. She served as President of the League until her death in 1922. While addressing the council of the Robert Gould Shaw House Association at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston, on January 9, 1922, she collapsed and died suddenly of heart disease. Legacy and honors *Her home from 1892 on has been preserved as the Maria Baldwin House and was designated as a National Historic Landmark. It is privately owned and not open to the public. *On February 12, 2004, Agassiz School was officially renamed as the Maria L. Baldwin School. The campaign was initiated by an eighth-grade student at the school and actively supported by other students and the principal. *Baldwin is noted on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail for her connection with the League of Women for Community Service. Personal life According to biographer Kathleen Weiler, Baldwin remained single: \\"As is true of many other aspects of Maria Baldwin's personal life, the reasons she remained single are not known. Her sister Alice also never married\\" and lived in all-female households with other black women teachers, and her black women associates included Alice Dunbar Nelson, who literary historian Gloria T. Hull concludes had significant lesbian intimacies.Gloria T. Hull, Give Us Each Day: The Diary of Alice Dunbar Nelson (W.W. Norton, 1984). Weiler speculates: \\"Perhaps Maria and Alice Baldwin valued their professional lives over marriage, or they may merely have preferred to remain single. That we have no evidence of Maria's romantic relationships with either men or women does not mean they had no relationships. It means that this part of their history, like so much of the inner life of black women of this generation, is simply unknown.\\"Kathleen Weiler, Maria Baldwin's Worlds (University of Massachusetts Press, 2019), pp. 156-157.

Murphy also co-produced.nytimes.com The Ramen Girl movie listing, producer credit: Brittany Murphy Plot Abby (Brittany Murphy) is an American girl who goes to Tokyo to be with her boyfriend, Ethan (Gabriel Mann). Ethan tells her that he has to go to Osaka on a business trip and may not be back for a while. Abby asks to go with him but Ethan refuses and breaks up with her. Abby goes to a ramen shop afterward, and the chef Maezumi (Toshiyuki Nishida) and his wife Reiko (Kimiko Yo) tell her that they are closed. Abby does not understand them as she does not speak Japanese. She starts to cry, so the chef conveys to her to sit down. He brings her a bowl of ramen, and she loves it. A small distance away, she hallucinates that the lucky cat, known as the Maneki Neko, or Beckoning Cat, gestures to her to come over. When she tries to pay for her meal, the chef and his wife refuse. The next day she comes back and sits down at the counter. He gives her another bowl of ramen and she eats. As she eats, she breaks into uncontrollable giggles, as does another patron. The following day she returns, but is told they are out of ramen. Seeing the wife's swollen ankles, she insists on helping instead. After the night is through, she is passed out asleep in the back. They shoo her out, but as she is walking away she realizes she wants to cook ramen. Rushing back into the store, she begs him to teach her how to cook ramen. He argues, but finally gives in and tells her to come the next day at 5. She shows up late, in high heels and a dress, and is put to work scrubbing the toilet and cleaning pots and pans. In the following weeks Maezumi only gives her cleaning work in the hopes that she quits, but she comes back. After she is given work as a waitress, she wins the hearts of all who come in, including two older women who are regular customers, and a 30-ish male laborer regular who develops a crush on her. On a rare night off, she heads to a night club with a British man named Charlie and an American woman named Gretchen whom she met earlier. The three meet Toshi Iwamoto (Sohee Park) and his friends. Abby and Toshi fall in love. Abby learns during the Christmas week of someone named Shintaro. She sees Maezumi crying over a collection of letters and photos from Paris. His wife then tells Abby that Maezumi and Shintaro, their son, have not spoken in 5 years since Shintaro left for France. Toshi has to go to Shanghai, China for three years. He asks Abby to come with him, but she declines, saying she can't. They share their last kiss. Abby soon learns how to make ramen, but Maezumi insists that it has no soul. Maezumi's mother tastes her ramen and tells her, in Japanese, that she is cooking with her head; when Abby confesses that there is only pain in her heart, Maezumi's mother advises that she should put tears in her ramen, as she has no love to share. Later in the film, she is shown cooking ramen, crying. The two ladies, the 20-ish male laborer, and another 20-ish male laborer from Okinawa, taste her ramen and almost immediately become melancholic, the pain in Abby's ramen bringing out their own. Maezumi tastes it, and starts to cry, but goes upstairs to his home. One day, Maezumi talks with a rival, who brags about his son having a master chef come to taste his ramen while ridiculing Maezumi for trying to train Abby. Maezumi, drunk, says that her ramen will receive the Master Chef's blessing, or he'll stop making ramen. The Master arrives, and tastes the young man's ramen, sampling small bits of it, very sparingly. He gives him his blessing, and goes on to Abby. Abby has strayed from the safety of conventional ramen, and made hers with peppers, corn and tomato, a concoction she calls \\"Goddess Ramen\\". The Master says Abby's noodles are good, but he cannot give her his blessing, saying that she needs more time and restraint. Maezumi is sad to have to stop his business, but talks to Abby. He tells her about his son wanting to learn French cooking, but she does not understand. He tells her that the ramen shop needs a successor, and that she is the successor of his ramen shop. She leaves for America soon, but before that, is invited to a celebration. Maezumi gives her the lantern that had hung outside his ramen shop for 45 years, and she takes it to America with her, where it is shown a year later outside her shop in New York City, appropriately named The Ramen Girl. The shop hangs a photo of Maezumi and his wife with their son happily in Paris. Then, an employee of hers tells her about a man wanting to see her. It is Toshi. He says he hated his job and that he decided to do what she would do: quit his job and go back to what he loved ‚Äì writing music. She welcomes him to her ramen shop and they kiss.

Story At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the government weakened by corruption was attacked by foreign influences. The people were flung into misery and became quite unsatisfied with the situation. They did not believe in the government anymore and turned their faith back to religion. The White Lotus Sect saw this as an opportunity and took over. They claimed to help the government to defeat foreigners and bring peace to the world. Their Ideology was quickly adopted. Everything related with the Western world was killed or destroyed. Anyone against this principal was considered an enemy and accused of being bound with the devil. Dragon of Martial Master and Master Huang of Po Chi Lam could not accept these outrageous actions so they band together in order to prevent much bloodshed. One day the leader of White Lotus Sect sent an invitation to Dragon and Master Huang but Dragon's disciples saw this as a trap and recommended that they wait for Master Huang, who was out of town collecting medicine.

The alignalghi () of the Siberian Yupiks is translated as \\"shaman\\" in Russian and English literature.Menov≈°ƒçikov 1968:442–†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞ 1954:203‚Äì19 While the word \\"shaman\\" comes from the Tungusic language,Voigt 2000:41‚Äì45 it is sometimes used by anthropologists when describing Alaskan Native beliefs.Kleivan & Sonne 1985Merkur 1985Freuchen 1961: 32Vitebsky 2001 However, most traditional people prefer to use the terminology found in their own, traditional Native languages. Traditional spiritual beliefs among the Alaskan Native peoples exhibit some characteristic features not universal in cultures based in animism, such as soul dualism (a dualistic or pluralistic concept of the soul) in certain groups, and specific links between the living, the souls of hunted animals and dead people.Oosten 1997: 86Vitebsky 1996:14 The death of either a person or a game animal requires that certain activities, such as cutting and sewing, be avoided to prevent harming their souls. In Greenland, the transgression of this \\"death taboo\\" could turn the soul of the dead into a tupilaq, a restless ghost who scared game away. Animals were thought to flee hunters who violated taboos.Kleivan & Sonne 1985:12‚Äì13, 18‚Äì21, 23 Chugach spiritual healers may begin their work after an out-of-body experience, such as seeing oneself as a skeleton, exemplified in Aua's (Iglulik) narration and a Baker Lake artworkKleivan & Sonne 1985:38, plate XXIIIVitebsky 1996:18  Special language  In some Alaskan Native communities, the spiritual people have used a distinctly archaic version of the community's normal language interlaced with special metaphors and speech styles.Freuchen 1961: 227, 228, 277Merkur 1985:7Kleivan & Sonne 1985:14Freuchen 1961:277 For example, \\"the shadow is ripening\\" means the healer is returning from his spiritual journey during a \\"seance\\".Freuchen 1961:228 Expert healers have been said to speak whole sentences differing from vernacular speech. The shamans among the Siberian Yupik peoples had a special language that used periphrastic substitutions for names of objects and phenomena; they used it for conversation with the ('spirits'). These spirits were believed to have a special language with certain substitutes for ordinary words (\\"the one with a drum\\": \\"shaman\\"; \\"that with tusks\\": \\"walrus\\").Bogoraz 1913: 437, 442, 444, 446, 448‚Äì449 The Ungazighmiit (a Siberian Yupik people) had a special allegoric usage of some expressions.Rubcova 1954:128 Observing the angakkuq Sorqaq's seance in a community at Qaanaaq, Peter Freuchen explains the motivation in that case: In this case, the special language was understood by the whole community, not restricted to the angakkuit or a few \\"experts\\".Freuchen 1961: 227 In some groups such variants were used when speaking with spirits invoked by the angakkuq and with unsocialised babies who grew into the human society through a special ceremony performed by the mother. Some writers have treated both phenomena as a language for communication with \\"alien\\" beings (mothers sometimes used similar language in a socialization ritual, in which the newborn is regarded as a little \\"alien\\" ‚Äî just like spirits or animal souls).Kleivan & Sonne 1985:6, 14, 33 The motif of a distinction between spirit and \\"real\\" human is present in a tale of the Ungazighmiit. Another interesting example of the special language and its contribution to relexicalization:  Techniques  Techniques and ceremonies vary among cultures.Kleivan & Sonne: 25 Sleight-of-hand, ventriloquismRasmussen 1965: 176 might be used to impress the audience. In some cultures the angakkuq was pinioned before the s√©ance,Kleivan & Sonne: Pl XXX, XXXIII or the angakkuq might hide behind a curtain. Holding the s√©ance in the dark with lamps extinguished was not obligatory, but the setting was familiar and widespread. Some authors suggest that an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, believing in the phenomena he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and honestly believe at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself with the blood of a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about this man was that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.Rasmussen 1965: 165‚Äì166  Social position  The boundary between angakkuq and lay person has not always been clearly demarcated. Non-angakkuq could experience hallucinations,Merkur 1985:41‚Äì42Gabus 1970:18,122 and almost every Alaskan Native can report memories of ghosts, animals in human form, or little people living in remote places.Merkur 1985:41 Experiences such as hearing voices from ice or stones were discussed as readily as everyday hunting adventures.Gabus 1970:203 Neither were ecstatic experiences the monopoly of angakkuit (reverie, daydreaming, even trance were not unknown by non-angakkuitMerkur 1985c), and laypeople (non-angakkuit) experiencing them were welcome to report their experiences and interpretations.Freuchen 1961: 210‚Äì211 The ability to have and command helping spirits was characteristic of angakkuit, but laypeople could also profit from spirit powers through the use of amulets. In one extreme instance a Netsilingmiut child had 80 amulets for protection.Kleivan & Sonne:43Rasmussen 1965:262 Some laypeople had a greater capacity than others for close relationships with special beings of the belief system; these people were often apprentice angakkuit who failed to complete their learning process.Kleivan & Sonne 1985:24 =Role in community= In some of the cultures, angakkuit may fulfill multiple functions, including healing, curing infertile women, and securing the success of hunts. These seemingly unrelated functions can be understood through the soul concept which, with some variation, underlies them. ;Healing :It is held that the cause of sickness is soul theft, in which someone (perhaps an enemy, whether human or a spirit) has stolen the soul of the sick person. It takes a spiritual healer to retrieve the stolen soul.Rasmussen 1965:177 The person remains alive because people have multiple souls, so stealing the appropriate soul causes illness or a moribund state rather than immediate death. According to another variant among Ammassalik in East Greenland, the joints of the body have their own small souls, the loss of which causes pain.Gabus 1970:274 ;Fertility :The angakkuq provides assistance to the soul of an unborn child to allow its future mother to become pregnant. ;Success of hunts :When game is scarce the angakkuq can visit (in a soul travel) a mythological being who protects all sea creatures (usually the Sea Woman), who keeps the souls of sea animals in her house or in a pot. If the angakkuq pleases her, she releases the animal souls thus ending the scarcity of game. Soul dualism is held in several cultures (including Eskimo, Uralic, Turkic peoples).Hopp√°l 2005: 27‚Äì28Hopp√°l 1975: 225 There are traces of beliefs that humans have more than one soul. The details have variations according to the culture. In several cases, a \\"free\\" soul and a \\"body\\" soul are distinguished: the free soul may depart body (during life), the body soul manages body functions. In several Alaskan Native cultures, it is the \\"free soul\\" of the angakkuq that undertakes these spirit journeys (to places such as the land of dead, the home of the Sea Woman, or the moon) whilst his body remains alive.Oosten 1997: 92 According to an explanation, this temporal absence of the healer's free soul is tackled by a substitution: the healer's body is guarded by one of his/her helping spirits during the spirit journey. A tale contains this motif while describing a spirit journey undertaken by the free soul and his helping spirits.Bar√ºske 1969: 24 (= Tale 8: \\"Das Land der Toten im Himmel\\") When a new angakkuq is first initiated, the initiator extracts the free soul of the new angakkuq and introduces it to the helping spirits so that they will listen when the new angakkuq invokes them;Merkur 1985:121 according to another explanation (that of the Iglulik angakkuq, Aua) the souls of the vital organs of the apprentice must move into the helping spirits: the new angakkuq should not feel fear of the sight of his new helping spirits.Rasmussen 1965:170 =Animals= Although humans and animals are not traditionally seen as interchangeable, there are diachronical notions of unity between human and animal: imaginations about an ancient time when the animal could take on human form at will ‚Äî it simply raised its forearm or wing to its face and lifted it aside at the muzzle or beak, like a mask.Oosten 1997: 90‚Äì91Bar√ºske 1969: 7, 9 Ceremonies may help preserve this ancient unity: a masked person represents the animal and, as s/he lifts the mask, the human existence of that animal appears. Masks among Alaskan Natives could serve several functions. There are also transformation masks reflecting the mentioned unity between human and animal.Thomas 2008 : +4 (= third page after the opening page of the article) In some Inuit groups, animals may be believed to have souls that are shared across their species. =Naming= In some groups, babies have been named after deceased relatives.Bar√ºske 1969: 48 (= Tale 15: \\"Asiaq, die Herrscherin √ºber Wind und Wetter\\") This might be supported by the belief that the child's developing, weak soul must be \\"supported\\" by a name-soul: invoking the departed name-soul which will then accompany and guide the child until adolescence. This concept of inheriting name-souls amounts to a sort of reincarnation among some groups, such as the Caribou Alaskan Natives. In a tale of the Ungazighmiit, an old woman expresses her desire to become ill, die and then \\"come\\" as a boy, a hunter. After specific preparations following her death, a newborn baby will be named after her.–†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞ 1954: 270‚Äì271 / 274‚Äì275 (= ‚Ññ 19 (132)‚Äì(162)) Similarly to several other Eskimo cultures, the name-giving of a newborn baby among Siberian Yupik meant that a deceased person was affected, a certain rebirth was believed. Even before the birth of the baby, careful investigations took place: dreams and events were analyzed. After the birth, the baby's physical traits were compared to those of the deceased person. The name was important: if the baby died, it was thought that he/she has not given the \\"right\\" name. In case of sickness, it was hoped that giving additional names could result in healing.Burch & Forman 1988: 90  Secrecy (or novelty) and the neutralizing effect of publicity  It was believed in several contexts that secrecy or privacy may be needed for an act or an object (either beneficial or harmful, intended or incidental) to be effective and that publicity may neutralize its effects.Kleivan & Sonne 1985:10-11, 15, 16, 23, 26, 28; Plate XLIII, XLV * Magic formulae usually required secrecy and could lose their power if they became known by other people than their owners. For example, a Chugach man experienced a sea otter swimming around, singing a song, a magic formula. He knew it is a help in hunting, whose efficiency will be lost for him if anybody else learns it.Merkur 1985: 65 Some of the functions of the angakkuit can be understood in the light of this notion of secrecy versus publicity. The cause of illness was usually believed to be soul theft or a breach of some taboo (such as miscarriage). Public confession (led by the shaman during a public seance) could bring relief to the patient. Similar public rituals were used in the cases of taboo breaches that endangered the whole community (bringing the wrath of mythical beings causing calamities).Kleivan & Sonne 1985:28 In some instances, the efficiency of magical formulae could depend on their novelty. A creation myth attributes such power to newly created words, that they became instantly true by their mere utterance.Freuchen 1961: 230 Also in practice, too much use of the same formulae could result in losing their power.Freuchen 1961: 277 According to a record, a man was forced to use all his magic formulae in an extremely dangerous situation, and this resulted in losing all his conjurer capabilities.Freuchen 1961: 215 As reported from the Little Diomede Island, new songs were needed regularly for the ceremonial held to please the soul of the whale, because \\"the spirits were to be summoned with fresh words, worn-out songs could never be used...\\".Freuchen 1961: 280 Cultural variations among Alaskan Natives = Inuit = Among Inuit, a spiritual healer is called an ' (plural: angakkuit, Inuktitut syllabics ·êä·ñì·ë¶·ëØ·ñÖ or ·êä·ñì·íÉ·ëØ·ñÖ) or in = Yupik and Yup'ik= Like the Netsilik Inuit, the Yupik have traditionally practiced tattooing.Tattoos of the early hunter-gatherers of the Arctic written by Lars Krutak They are also one of the cultures who have a special language for talking to spirits, called .  Ungazighmiit  The Siberian Yupiks had shamans, and only in Siberia is the term, \\"shaman\\" traditionally found.–î—É—Ö–æ–≤–Ω–∞—è –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ (Spiritual culture) , subsection of Support for Siberian Indigenous Peoples Rights (–ü–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤ –∫–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –°–∏–±–∏—Ä–∏) Compared to the variants found among Eskimo groups of America, shamanism among Siberian Yupiks stressed more the importance of maintaining good relationship with sea animals. The Ungazighmiit (in Cyrillic transliteration: , ), speaking the largest of the Siberian Yupik language variants, called a shaman alignalghi (–∞–ª–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª”∑–∏, ). The alignalghi received presents for the shamanizing. There were many words for \\"presents\\" in the language spoken by Ungazighmiit, depending on the nature and occasion (such as a marriage).–†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞ 1954:173 These included such fine distinctions as \\"thing, given to someone who has none\\", \\"thing, given, not begged for\\", \\"thing, given to someone as to anybody else\\" and \\"thing, given for exchange\\". Among these many kinds of presents, the one given to the shaman was called .–†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞ 1954:62 The Ungazighmiit have also traditionally had a special allegoric usage of some expressions for working with the spirits.–†—É–±—Ü–æ–≤–∞ 1954:128  Chugach  The Chugach people live on the southernmost coasts of Alaska. Birket- Smith conducted fieldwork among them in the 1950s, when traditionally ceremonial ways had already ceased practice. Chugach apprentice angakkuit were not forced to become spiritual healers by the spirits. They instead deliberately visited lonely places and walked for many days until they received a visitation of a spirit. The apprentice then passed out, and the spirit took him or her to another place (like the mountains or the depths of the sea). Whilst there, the spirit instructed the apprentice in their calling, such as teaching them their personal song.Merkur 1985:125 See also * Inuit religion * Masks among Eskimo peoples * Messenger Feast * Bladder Festival * Native American religion * Noaidi * Shamanism among Alaska Natives * Shamanism in Siberia * Traditional Alaska Native medicine  Notes  References = Latin = * The tale title means: \\"The soul who wandered through all animals\\"; the book title means: \\"Eskimo tales\\"; the series means: \\"The tales of world literature\\". * The tale title means: \\"The land of the dead in the sky\\"; the book title means: \\"Eskimo tales\\"; the series means: \\"The tales of world literature\\". * The tale title means: \\"Asiaq, the mistress over wind and weather\\"; the book title means: \\"Eskimo tales\\"; the series means: \\"The tales of world literature\\".

Most stores were over in size, with many including dive pools and offering SCUBA classes. Sport Chalet stores usually featured large apparel and footwear departments complemented by an array of specialized departments and sections. On April 16, 2016, the company announced that it would close all stores in the coming months and that all online sales had already stopped. The last stores closed in June 2016.https://www.webcitation.org/6iegDZsep?url=http://www.sportchalet.com/stores.html History Sport Chalet was founded on April 1, 1959 by newlyweds Norbert Olberz, a former baker, and his wife Irene, who bought a ski and tennis shop in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California, for $4000, equaling a $2500 check plus a negotiation, from Milo Svoboda, the original owner, whose store had only been open four months. To initially stock the store with ski gear, the couple took out a $5,000 loan and borrowed money from a relative and some employees. Early on, Sport Chalet stocked products that few other stores sold, such as scuba and mountain-climbing gear. When surfing became popular in the early 1960s, the store began carrying longboards and wetsuits. Sport Chalet grew piecemeal in La Ca√±ada along Foothill Boulevard. Olberz converted a former grocery store into a full-line sporting goods store and an old furniture store became the ski shop. He also converted a gas station into a ski rental shop and opened a golf store down the street. Sport Chalet's location was about one block southeast of the intersection with Angeles Crest Highway, a major route into the San Gabriel Mountains. The company opened its second store in 1981 in Huntington Beach, California. By the mid-1980s, the company expanded to have stores throughout Southern California. Sport Chalet started being traded publicly on the NASDAQ exchange in 1992. In 1997 Craig Levra came on board as president and in 1999 took over as CEO. Norbert Olberz died in La Ca√±ada Flintridge on July 15, 2011,\\"Norbert Olberz dies at 86; Sport Chalet founder, CEO for 4 decades\\", Los Angeles Times, July 19, 2011. survived by his wife Irene and his son Eric. Two years later Eric resigned from the board, replaced by Miki Berardelli, chief marketing officer of New York women‚Äôs clothing designer and retailer Tory Burch. In 2014 Sport Chalet was sold to Vestis Retail Group for $17M, as well as absorbing its current $50M in debts. Vestis was owned by the private equity firm Versa Capital Management. On April 16, 2016, Sport Chalet announced that all stores would close, with May 15 being the last day for customers to use gift cards and store credits, and that online merchandise sales had already been stopped.\\"Sport Chalet Is Closing All Stores, Has Stopped Online Sales, Retailer Announces\\", KTLA, April 16, 2016. Subsequently, Vestis Retail Group, which owns the Eastern Mountain Sports and Bob's Stores sporting goods chains as well as Sport Chalet, announced it had filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.http://www.kccllc.net/vestisretailgroupDawn McCarty & Steven Church, \\"Eastern Mountain in Bankruptcy as Shopping Habits Change\\", Bloomberg News, April 17, 2016. By June 2016, all stores had closed. Corporate environment Sport Chalet claimed to pride itself on employing well-trained and knowledgeable employees who had extensive knowledge and/or experience in their respective departments, leading to one of the companies slogans 'The Experts'. Sport Chalet was one of the few major sporting goods retailers to focus on a broad array of more specialized sports, including kayaking, SCUBA diving, mountain climbing, canyoneering, and other extreme sports. Sport Chalet additionally used the slogan \\"We'll Take You to The Limit\\". In 1998, Olberz gave $1.5 million in stock to 109 employees who had been with the company for at least 10 years. The company was the title sponsor of the \\"U.S.B.A. California Regional Tour.\\" The tour was a collection of three events that were sanctioned by the United States Bodyboarding Association, that took place at different Southern California beaches; events ran between June 7, 2008 and November 9, 2008. Following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, Sport Chalet, in conjunction with Soles 4 Souls, began accepting donations of gently worn shoes at all their locations until January 31, 2010. They collected almost 1 million pairs of shoes in 2 weeks.

It runs physically north and south though it is signed as a west-east highway with its western terminus at US 276 and its eastern terminus at US 25/SC 418\\\\. Route description SC 8 begins in Ware Place at the junction of US 25 and SC 418\\\\. From here, it travels west for about when it crosses the Saluda River and enters the town of Pelzer in Anderson County. It meets SC 20 at the town limit of Pelzer and after crossing SC 20 it enters West Pelzer. After exiting West Pelzer, it runs northwest for and has an interchange with US 29. About past US 29, the highway has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) at its exit 32. Another mile past this interchange, SC 8 intersects SC 81, which runs concurrent with SC 8 for two miles (3 km). SC 8 turns to the west and crosses SC 88 and winds its way to the western terminus of SC 86. Here, it turns to the northwest and crosses into Pickens County and runs toward Easley. Soon after entering the city limits of Easley, it meets SC 135 and overlaps it for . SC 8 then turns to the northwest and crosses US 123, but has no access to the highway directly. After one mile (1.6 km), it intersects SC 93 just west of downtown Easley. From here, it is eight miles (13 km) to Pickens, and for this duration, the road is four-laned. In downtown Pickens, SC 8 meets SC 183 and overlaps it for a half-mile. SC 8 continues straight and runs toward Pumpkintown, along the way meeting the western terminus of SC 186 and the northern terminus of SC 135. In Pumpkintown, it crosses SC 288 and soon meets SC 11, which it has a concurrency with for about a half-mile. SC 8 then turns north and meets its end at US 276 in northern Greenville County. History The first alignment of SC 8 ran from the Georgia state line through Anderson, Greenville, Greer, Spartanburg, Gaffney, and Blacksburg into North Carolina near Grover. This alignment connected directly to Georgia State Route 8 at the Georgia state line. In 1927, this became US 29, and SC 8 was put onto a completely different alignment, which was previously SC 13 (which was reused on former SC 17). With a few minor changes, this is today's SC 8.

It is located about 40 km northeast of Valdivia, close to Cruces River. The capital is the city of San Jos√© de la Mariquina. The commune's main economic activities are agriculture, cattle farming and wood pulp manufacturing. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Mariquina spans an area of and has 18,223 inhabitants (9,361 men and 8,862 women). Of these, 8,925 (49%) lived in urban areas and 9,298 (51%) in rural areas. The population grew by 1.5% (271 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Mariquina is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The current alcalde is Ronaldo Mitre Gatica. Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Mariquina is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Alfonso De Urresti (PS) and Mr. Roberto Delmastro (RN) as part of the 53rd electoral district, (together with Valdivia, Lanco, M√°fil and Corral). The commune is represented in the Senate by Andr√©s Allamand Zavala (RN) and Eduardo Frei Ruiz -Tagle (PDC) as part of the 16th senatorial constituency (Los R√≠os Region). History In the mid-17th century local cacique Juan Manqueante ruled the lands of Mariquina. He presented himself to the Dutch who had arrived in Valdivia in 1643 as a friend.Barros Arana 2000, p. 285. When the Spanish returned in 1645 he allied to them for about ten years until the Mapuche uprising of 1655. Local lore consider him the most notable person ever born in the lands of Mariquina. Manqueante was catholic according to contemporary chronicler Diego de Rosales. According to Tom√°s Guevara by the 18th century the Mapuche of Mariquina were among the last to raise chilihueques, a now extinct llama-like animal. During the Mapuche uprising of 1881 most women of San Jos√© de la Mariquina were sent to the city of Valdivia as men prepared for hostilities. Chileans and German settlers dug defensive trenches around the town. At the moment of the uprising it was even thought that rebels could reach Valdivia in the south if they succeeded in penetrating San Jos√© de la Mariquina.

Plot Against the advice of his best friend Ted (Michael Weston), Anderson (Jason Biggs) publicly proposes to his girlfriend Vanessa (Audra Blaser), while dressed in a cupid costume. The shock of the unexpected proposal leads to her instantaneous death. Utterly devastated and distraught, Anderson quits his job and goes into mourning. A year later, Anderson is still obsessed with his perfect (and dead) former girlfriend. While Ted and Anderson are lunching together in a diner, to help him move on, Ted persuades Anderson to give romance one more try. To placate his friend, Anderson agrees, looks around, and asks attractive waitress Katie (Isla Fisher) to marry him. To both men's utter astonishment, she accepts Anderson's proposal. Anderson and Katie then decide to take things slow, the same day she moves into Anderson's apartment. Meanwhile, Anderson is feeling guilty as when he is accidentally knocked unconscious he talks to his former girlfriend, the late Vanessa, promising to be ever faithful. However he goes ahead with plans to meet Katie's parents, and brings Katie to meet his parents. The pair soon begin to get on well with each other. Katie's father, Smitty, breaks out of jail to walk her down the aisle. He arrives at his ex- wife (Katie's mother)'s house and through their long lost passion for one another, their love sparks again, much to Stuart's (Lois's current husband) discomfort. After a falling out over Anderson's late girlfriend, Anderson and Katie's relationship looks to be over. This pivotal moment in the film leads to the pair finally declaring their fondness of one another. The couple suddenly run off to Atlantic City, with help from Ted. Anderson, Katie, Ted and the rest of the party drive to Atlantic City in a car from the car dealership where Ted works (under the pretense of test driving the vehicle). Katie's ex-boyfriend, William, tries to persuade Katie that they should be together. He proceeds to assault Anderson on the way to their wedding. Ted's boss reports the car stolen, and in an unfortunate event, they crash into a police car, resulting in their arrest. Meanwhile, Katie's parents know where they're headed and make their way there, stopping to rob the Tuxedo Depot in preparation for the wedding. Katie's parents are then arrested for robbing the store. They all end up in the same police station, and Anderson's parents also turn up after he calls them. In a lucky turn of events the group is able to escape from the station after stealing an officer's gun and locking them in a cell. At this point Anderson and Katie establish for the final time that they want to get married, and for the first time the whole group is in favor. Now in a police van, which the policemen let them use, they drive to Atlantic City and Anderson and Katie finally get married. However, as soon as they step outside they are all arrested. Anderson and Katie spend their honeymoon in jail.

They arrived between 1818-1820. This area was ideal for the remaining Native Americans who lived, hunted, fished, and farmed this region. Most of the Native American Families around 1800 contracted Small Pox and were all but wiped out. Only 13 families remained and they welcomed the freedmen with open arms.\\"Memories of Lakeview, Jewell Cofield, 1976 The South Fork of Saline River periodic flooding is the reason of the 19th century name \\"Pond Settlement\\" then later \\"Lakeview\\". Similar to why Harrisburg was named \\"Crusoe's Island\\" prior to 1850. This flooding is still prevalent today. Census records indicate that the first settlers were the Allen, Blackwell, Taborn, Mitchell, Evans, Cofield, and Cole Families. These earliest Lakeview residents were most self-sufficient. They depended on a mixture of hunting and farming for their food. The early families had substantial land holdings in the Pre-Civil War era. It was only after the village of Morrillsville, later known as Carrier Mills, was established that some of these holdings were sold off. Whites continued to buy land around Lakeview during the remainder of the nineteenth century, resulting in the breakup of the larger land holdings. Never a formal community or village, Lakeview covered a series of farmsteads concentrated about ; however, the focus of the settlement has always been on the church and school, along what was is now Taborn Road.History of Saline County, 1995, Genealogy Department Lakeview had its own school and grocery store along with many homes. In 1850, a Union Church was established near Carrier Mills in Saline County. Most members were either Baptist or Methodist. An African Methodist Episcopal Church was organized at the home of Irvin Allen, who then built a one-room log church building on his property. Later they organized and built a frame structure on the M. Taylor farm. After the church burned they rebuilt and moved the church to Carrier Mills where it sits today. This congregation is now Baber Chapel AME Church. The Lakeview cemetery, founded in 1838, has become a state historical landmark. The area of Lakeview is still a nearly 100% black area. After the closing of the Lakeview school in the 1950s, many people moved to the east side of Carrier Mills.

As President of the International Baseball Association from 1981 to 1993, he is the person most credited with getting the sport of baseball accepted into the Olympic Games as an official gold medal sport. For these efforts, he is a recipient of the Olympic Order, the highest honor given by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Baseball career Smith graduated from Greenville College in Greenville, Illinois in 1957 and went to work at the college a few years after graduation as a physical education instructor and baseball coach, in 1961. Smith began his work with the Olympics when he began to work on the United States Olympic Committee in 1977. Smith was elected President of the United States Baseball Federation in 1980 (until 1989) and then quickly ascended to the presidency of the International Baseball Federation/International Baseball Association (IBA) the following year at the Baseball World Cup held in Japan. At the IBA's Congress in 1988, held in conjunction with the Nicaragua Baseball World Cup, Smith was re-elected as President, and he held the office until 1993. That year, he was succeeded by Aldo Notari of Italy. During Dr. Smith's time as international leader of amateur baseball, he coordinated 26 world baseball tournaments, continued to serve on the United States Olympic Committee in varying capacities until 1990, and directed the baseball competitions at the Olympic Games in 1984 in Los Angeles, 1988 in Seoul, and 1992 in Barcelona. Smith is often acknowledged as being responsible for baseball becoming an official Olympic sport. Baseball was allowed as a demonstration sport at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and Smith hoped that it would be played for medals in 1988 in Seoul. He and baseball's supporters in the effort did not make that goal, but nevertheless Smith's time as president was unique in that he saw the end to decades of work by baseball enthusiasts when the International Olympic Committee decided to add baseball as an official sport of the Games for 1992. He oversaw the winning of the first-ever gold medal for baseball, won by Cuba in Barcelona in 1992. The International Olympic Committee voted in 2006 to drop baseball and softball in the Olympics, beginning with the 2012 Games in London. Greenville College presidency Smith served as a key development officer for Greenville College before being hired as Vice President for Institutional Advancement. While serving in that capacity, Smith was chosen by the GC Board of Trustees as the ninth President of Greenville College. He retired in 1998 and has since worked with the Fellowship of Christian Athletes in southern Illinois. Smith and his wife Joanna celebrated their 60th anniversary on August 30, 2017. The two had met as students at Greenville College in 1955 and married in San Diego in 1957. Joanna passed away on June 5, 2018 at the age of 81. Honors Dr. Smith was given the Olympic Order, the highest honor given by the International Olympic Committee, for his efforts to bring gold medal baseball to fruition. It is awarded to \\"any person who has illustrated the Olympic ideal through his action, has achieved remarkable merit in the sporting world or has rendered outstanding services to the Olympic Movement, either through his own personal achievement or his own contribution to the development of sport.‚Äù Smith was elected to the NAIA Hall of Fame as a baseball coach. The NAIA Baseball Coaches Executive Committee created an award for baseball coaches and administrators, the \\"Robert E. Smith Achievement Award,\\" with Smith as the first winner in 1999. The award honors \\"unselfish promotion of NAIA baseball\\" and is presented annually at the NAIA Baseball Hall of Fame and Honors Luncheon.

As with most of North Carolina's waterfalls, it is in the mountainous area of the state. There is a cluster of falls in the area where the borders of Georgia and the Carolinas come together. Corbin Creek Falls is part of that group, very close to the South Carolina border. Natural history Corbin Creek Falls is viewable in the same area as Upper Whitewater Falls. Corbin Creek Falls cascades 600 ft over the course of a half mile. However, not all of the falls can be seen from one location, and the hike to the falls is very difficult. There is some debate as to the height of the falls. Kevin Adams' book North Carolina Waterfalls lists the height as over 400 feet. NCWaterfalls.com lists the falls as \\"tumbling 600 feet\\", but states that it would hesitate to call the falls a 600-foot waterfall. Google Earth, from the first dropoff at lat 35.037517, long -83.011653 indicate a starting elevation of 2,716 feet, and a closing elevation of 2,060 feet at 35.032859, -83.013340, giving a height of 656 ft.

Early career Bell's father, Jimmy, who died in 2010, was a well-known local singer, and his late mother, Leonora Rogers, was in show business prior to marriage, after which she was heavily involved in local music and dance. Graham made a solo single in 1966 and one year later replaced Alan Hull as the singer of psychedelic rock band Skip Bifferty (later renamed Heavy Jelly). In 1969 he was singer in another psychedelic rock band, Griffin. In 1970 he began his stint with Charisma Records, joining Every Which Way, a band formed by Brian Davison formerly of The Nice, as singer and principal writer. Musical style was jazzy progressive rock with guitar from John Hedley (who was later part of Last Exit, with Sting) playing call and response with Bell's blues shout vocals. Bell then rejoined his old mates from Skip Bifferty, now known as Arc, to form Bell & Arc in July 1971, with John Turnbull, Mick Gallagher, Bud Beadle, Kenny Craddock, Steve Gregory, Tom Duffy and Alan White. Bell was then tempted to leave the group to record his self-titled solo album in 1972, featuring Tim Hinkley, Tim Drummond, Mel Collins and Ian Wallace, and produced by Bob Johnston. 1970s and America After Bell's appearance in the London Symphony Orchestra version of Tommy it was reported that Pete Townshend produced an album for him, but it never saw the light of day. In 1974 he contributed backing vocals on Carol Grimes' Warm Blood also featuring Tommy Eyre, Jess Roden, John 'Rabbit' Bundrick and Henry Lowther. In the late 1970s Graham Bell was featured on the front page of Sounds music paper as a \\"the man most likely to\\", but sadly his profile was affected by the rise of punk and the new wave. Bell moved to America, where he toured with Long John Baldry, and was the co- front man along with Jackie Lomax of a band of LA Brit expatriates known as the Tea Bags, among others, before returning to his native Northeast England in the mid 1980s. He also lived for a while in Cumbria before finally heading for London again and cropping up in Snowy White's Blues Agency in 1988/89. In 2008 he died of cancer shortly after his 60th birthday.

Tol (born 2 December 1969, Hoorn, the Netherlands) is a professor of economics at the University of Sussex. He is also professor of the economics of climate change at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He is a member of the Academia Europaea. Academic career Tol obtained an MSc in econometrics & operations research in 1992 and a PhD in economics in 1997 at the VU University Amsterdam. His doctoral thesis was titled, A decision- analytic treatise of the enhanced greenhouse effect. In 1998, he contributed with some nineteen other academics to a joint project of the United Nations Environment Programme at his home university. He regularly participates in studies of the Energy Modeling Forum, is an editor of Energy Economics, associate editor of Environmental and Resource Economics, and a member of the editorial board of Environmental Science and Policy, and Integrated Assessment. IDEAS/RePEc ranks him among the top 250 economists in the world.Top 5% Authors on IDEAS/RePEc Tol specialises in energy economics and environmental economics, with a particular interest in climate change, such as the economics of global warming. Previously, Tol was a research professor at the Economic and Social Research Institute. Before that, Tol was the Michael Otto Professor of Sustainability and Global Change and director of the Center for Marine and Atmospheric Sciences and board member of the Center for Marine and Climate Research at the University of Hamburg. Tol was a board member of the International Max Planck Research Schools on Earth System Modeling and Maritime Affairs and the European Forum on Integrated Environmental Assessment., p. 20. From 1998 to 2008 he was an adjunct professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Engineering and Public Policy, and from 2010 to 2011 an adjunct professor at Trinity College, Dublin's Department of Economics. Climate change According to Tol \\"the impact of climate change is relatively small\\". Despite being an economist he was also among the US Senate Republican Party's \\"list of scientists disputing man-made global warming claims\\", which stated that Tol \\"dismissed the idea that mankind must act now to prevent catastrophic global warming\\".Minority Senate report Tol characterises his position as arguing that the economic costs of climate policy should be kept in proportion to its benefits.Financial Times, Jan 17, 2008Financial Times, Jan 18, 2007New Scientist, Dec 5, 2007 He argues against the 2 ¬∞C 'guardrail' target for limiting temperature rises. Tol does not advocate another target, but has suggested that a carbon tax of $20/tC would be a policy in line with estimates of the cost of carbon.R.S.J. Tol (2008), The Social Cost of Carbon: Trends, Outliers and Catastrophes, Economics the E-Journal, 2008‚Äì25 He acknowledges that this level of taxation is too low to significantly discourage fossil fuel use but argues it would help to stimulate the development of fuel-saving technology and improve the competitiveness of renewable energy sources. He states that compliance may affect the coal and oil industries and the people they employ. In an interview with Der Spiegel in 2005, he argued that temperature rises between 2‚Äì4 ¬∞C would also have advantages. North of a line drawn from Paris to Munich, people would benefit, e.g., from reduced energy bills. However, south of it, people would be overall \\"losers\\" of climate change.Spiegel, Feb 21, 2005 In 2007, Tol predicted a reduction in annual economic growth by 0.4% in the Republic of Ireland if greenhouse gases were reduced by 3% per year.Irish Times, Dec 20, 2007 In 2009, Tol published an influential paper that combined data from several earlier studies, concluding that at least some amount of global warming could lead to economic gains. In 2014, he published an update, correcting missing minus signs that had turned economic costs into benefits and adding data overlooked before; the mistakes he attributed to \\"gremlins\\". According to Tol, the old and new results were not significantly different. The degree to which the corrected, more pessimistic results alter the original conclusions and their policy implications was hotly debated. In 2015 it was reported that a second round of corrections to the paper was necessary. Tol was a coordinating lead author for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. Tol said in March 2014 that he had withdrawn from the writing team for the Summary for Policy Makers of the report in September 2013, citing disagreement with the profile of the report which he considered too alarmist and putting too little emphasis on opportunities to adapt to climate changes.IPCC author brands upcoming climate report 'alarmist' The Guardian. 28 March 2014. Retrieved 29 March 2014 On 20 May 2014 Tol wrote, in an article for FoxNews.com, that the IPCC is alarmist because it favors initial scientific papers published on an issue, rather than the follow-up papers, which, he says, tend to \\"pooh-pooh the initial drama.\\" =Copenhagen Consensus= Bj√∏rn Lomborg chose Tol to participate in his \\"Copenhagen Consensus\\" project in 2008. In 2008, Tol collaborated with Gary Yohe, Richard G. Richels and Geoffrey Blanford to prepare the \\"Challenge Paper\\" on global warming which examined three approaches devised by Lomborg for tackling the issue. The 3 results were then compared with 27 similar investigations, 3 each relating to 9 other 'challenges' in the areas of health and environment. Of the 30 policy alternatives that resulted, Lomborg's ranking procedure rated the 2 dealing with controlling emissions of greenhouse gases 29th and 30th in terms of cost effectiveness. A \\"perspective paper\\" by Anil Markandya of the University of Bath on the Yohe/Tol study stated that \\"a short time period analysis is misleading\\" when all the costs are incurred during the period examined but benefits continue to accrue after its conclusion. He pointed out that the study \\"stops short of the most that can be supported on a cost benefit basis\\" and stated that \\"it does not seem reasonable\\" to rely solely on Tol's own FUND model when alternatives \\"reported in the peer-reviewed literature are also credible\\". Gary Yohe later accused Lomborg of \\"deliberate distortion of our conclusions\\", adding that \\"as one of the authors of the Copenhagen Consensus Project's principal climate paper, I can say with certainty that Lomborg is misrepresenting our findings thanks to a highly selective memory\\". In a subsequent joint statement settling their differences, Lomborg and Yohe agreed that the \\"failure\\" of Lomborg's emissions reduction plan \\"could be traced to faulty design\\". Lomborg awarded Tol a position on his Copenhagen Consensus panel again in 2009. According to Tol, \\"Lomborg successfully punches holes in climate hysteria\\" and \\"plays a useful role in the debate on climate policy\\". =Climate change and conflict= According to Tol, \\"it is not clear whether climate change would lead to conflict\\". Citing a lack of suitable methods for evaluating hypothetical conflicts numerically, he examines what he calls plausible scenarios, such as drought and migration in the Horn of Africa or an upsurge in terrorism. Regarding terrorism, he says \\"it may well be that a Maldivian terrorist will try and blow up the headquarters of ExxonAramco\\". Regarding the Horn of Africa scenario, he acknowledges it might cause substantial human suffering but assesses the probability of this actually happening as unlikely. He concludes that \\"poor and exhausted people are unlikely to take up arms, and if they do, they are probably not very effective\\".

The park was named after a Native American word meaning \\"the meeting of the waters\\". It lies adjacent to the confluence of the Dupage, Des Plaines, and Kankakee Rivers. The park is near the municipality of Channahon, Illinois. It is served by U.S. Highway 6. See also * The Shabbona Trail goes through Channahon State Park and ends in Gebhard Woods State Park. * Gebhard Woods is located along the long National Park Service Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor. Near Channahon, at the junction of the DesPlaines and Kankakee Rivers,lies one of the most important archaeological sites in America. This important Native American site was carefully excavated by Mr. George Langford-research associate in the Dept. of Anthropology of the University of Chicago. During his time in the 1930s this site was known popularly as the, \\"Fisher site\\" or \\"Fisher Group\\" and consisted of nine mounds and fifty conical pits once used as a camp site. The mound ranged in size from average 30 feet in diameter to as much as 60 feet in diameter while the pits were 30 feet in diameter and 3 feet deep. The two largest mounds are of the most significant importance of all the finds made in Il. These show periods of regular building and rebuilding. The primary mound was constructed and bodies were buried in it. These were buried together with characteristic utensils. For years the mound would stand undisturbed and grass and weeds built up humus layers on it and then other tribes would come in with different cultures and different tools where they buried their dead. This went on successively so that when the mound was sliced down the middle the layers of strata separated the ages all the way back to 2000 years before the Hopewell arrived! These finds were made well below ground level of the original mound. In general the people of the lowest level had 'long heads' than the round skulls found above them. While these are not the 'cone head' but longer type of skull more akin to a 'Pharaoh skull' shape out the back they are significantly different in type and height to the later tribes arriving to occupy the same area. Tools were scarcely seen in the older dig sites. We have cultural stratification made evident first by the dark humus layers then by distinctive material cultures, methods of burial and difference in physical type all in the same dig site. By comparing the camp site to the different levels in the mounds, the relative age of each was established. Similar sites like that of Joliet and Oakwoods furthered that dating but none compared historically to the findings of Channahon, IL. and the Fisher Site. This history complete from the University of Illinois and the U of Chicago is all documented in the Il. State Blue Book of 1931-2. The cultural sequences established from this dig make the Fisher group one of the most important sites excavated in both the State of Il. and the USA ever discovered as few digs were allowed after these were finished. It is also significant that this find in Channahon, Il proves an apparent change in the head form between the lowest burials than those above. Whatever group lived here in the last ice age was of significantly different type than the modern day occupants.

It connects the towns of Winlock and Toledo to Interstate 5 (I-5) and SR 504\\\\. Route description SR 505 begins at the intersection of Kerron Street and Walnut Street in downtown Winlock, on the east side of Olequa Creek. Kerron Street, once part of SR 603, continues north towards Napavine and south to Vader along the Seattle Subdivision of the BNSF Railway. Walnut Street crosses over the double-tracked railroad and leaves downtown, traveling around a hill with the city's cemetery. The highway travels southeast and passes two small suburban subdivisions before turning on Cemetery Road. SR 505 continues southeast across the rural Grand Prairie to an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) at Pikes Hill. From the interchange, the highway descends into the Cowlitz Prairie, turning south at a junction with Jackson Highway and reaching Toledo. SR 505 runs southeasterly through the city's street grid and turns east onto Cowlitz Street before crossing the Cowlitz River. The highway travels east across the forested Layton Prairie towards the Wilkes Hills, which SR 505 crosses via two narrow north‚Äìsouth passes. The highway continues south and descends from the hills, terminating at a junction with SR 504 (the Spirit Lake Highway) along the north bank of the North Fork Toutle River near Toutle. SR 505 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 470 vehicles at its eastern terminus to a maximum of 5,200 vehicles in downtown Toledo. SR 505 was also designated as a state scenic byway by the legislature in 1993. History Until 1992, SR 505 from I-5 west to Winlock was part of State Route 603, which continued north from Winlock through Napavine to SR 6 about two miles (3 km) west of I-5 in Chehalis. Several changes were made to the state highways throughout Washington in 1992, and at that time the section from SR 6 to Winlock was turned back to the county, while the rest became a part of a realignment of SR 505. Until that time, SR 505 began at an interchange with I-5 and SR 506 west of Toledo. The county road is still signed \\"Highway 603\\" from SR 6 to Winlock even though it is no longer part of the state highway system. The Cowlitz River Bridge in Toledo was rebuilt in 1994.

Its native range stretches from Texas in the United States south to central Mexico. This perennial is not listed as being threatened. It reaches a height of . Blackbrush Acacia grows on limestone hillsides and canyons.  Phytochemistry  A phytochemical study of V. rigidula by workers at the Texas A & M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center at Uvalde, TX, reported the presence of over forty alkaloids, including low amounts (up to around 15 ppm) of several amphetamines that had previously been found by the same research group in the related species Senegalia berlandieri, but which otherwise are known only as products of laboratory synthesis. Compounds found in the highest concentrations (ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand ppm) were phenethylamine, N-methylphenethylamine, tyramine and N-methyltyramine. Other notable compounds reported were N,N-dimethyltryptamine, mescaline, amphetamine, methamphetamine and nicotine, although these were found in low concentrations (e.g. mescaline at 3-28 ppm). The presence of such an unprecedented chemical range of psychoactive compounds, including ones not previously found in nature, in a single plant species has led to the suggestion that some of these findings may have resulted from cross-contamination or were possibly artifacts of the analytical technique.  Uses  Vachellia rigidula is used in weight loss dietary supplements because of the presence of chemical compounds claimed to stimulate beta-receptors to increase lipolysis and metabolic rate and decrease appetite. Vachellia rigidula is also known as a large honey producer and early blooming plant for its native region. = Safety = In 2015, 52% of supplements labeled as containing Acacia rigidula were found to be adulterated with synthetic BMPEA, an amphetamine isomer. Consumers following recommended maximum daily servings would consume a maximum of 94 mg of BMPEA per day. In 2012, however, the FDA determined that BMPEA was not naturally present in Acacia rigidula leaves.

His position is midfield. Playing career =Sharks= Asechemie began his career in his native Nigeria playing for Sharks he enjoyed one season with the club, but was soon on the move, joining Maltese newly promoted team Marsa for the 2001-2002 season. =Marsa= Asechemie became an instant hit in his first season with Marsa after some impressive performances had helped save the club from relegation in their first season in the top flight for a very long time. His second season in Maltese football saw a prove himself to be without doubt one of the best players in the Maltese League, rumours began to circulate that there was interest from Italian third division club Frosinone in the summer of 2002, but nothing materialised. Asechemie had become hot property by the 2003-2004 season and had gained a call up to the Nigerian national team and earned two caps for his home nation. Despite his best efforts with Marsa, they were eventually relegated. With the Nigerian's profile rising, and seemingly too good to play in the Maltese League, it seemed inevitable that he would leave Malta, he spent the summer of that season on trial for various clubs across Europe in hope of a move to a big club. He was a trialist with Polish top side Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, Viborg FF of Denmark and Bristol City in England. Was on the verge of signing for Maltese First Division side Marsaxlokk, and Polish Second Division Side MKS Cracovia but eventually he went back to Marsa in Malta in order to start the new season with the relegated club. =Marsaxlokk= Rumours continued and the name of Asechemie was linked with many clubs, but weeks before the new season in Malta was about to begin Marsaxlokk signed Asechemie. He looked like a great signing for Marsaxlokk and if he continued the form he had a Marsa then it seemed the club had really pulled off a major coup. Unfortunately for both Marsaxlokk and Asechemie, the Nigerian had not lived up to the billing and after just two season Marsaxlokk released the player. Managers and coaches were still aware of what Asechemie had achieved in Malta with Marsa and he wasn't short of trials to find a new club. In January 2005 he was on trial with Scottish club Dunfermline Athletic but failed to make the grade. Asechemie's situation got worse and after other failed trials his fitness and lack of first team football began to show, in 2005-2006 he was also the subject of failed trials with Welsh side Swansea City, and English side Bristol Rovers and even Conference side Forest Green Rovers. =Clevedon Town= In 2006, Asechemie (once one of the hottest prospects in Nigerian football) finally found a club in the form of newly promoted Southern League Premier Division side Clevedon Town. Despite Asechemie's profile he often only made the bench for his new side, and after less than one season with just one league appearance to show, Asechemie left the club and subsequently went back to the drawing board.

Field won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress - Drama Series for her portrayal, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series, nominated for two other Emmys, and nominated for three Golden Globes. Character history =Background= Nora Walker is the matriarch of the Walker family. She has five children: Sarah, Kitty, Tommy, Kevin, and Justin. She has a brother, Saul. She was married to William Walker for almost forty years. Nora was raised Jewish. She had a difficult relationship with her mother, Ida (Season 1 Episode 13). =Season 1= In the first episode Nora's husband, William, died of a heart attack. She later learned about his long affair and illegitimate daughter with his mistress, Holly. Nora slowly learns to accept this secret daughter, and meanwhile deals with the pains and joys of her own five children and newly discovered stepdaughter, Rebecca Harper. She also begins a short romance with a handy man named David Morton. However, their relationship ends when Nora realizes that it is too soon after William's death to be moving on. =Season 2= The second season sees Nora has slowly moved on from William's death and started dating again. In the episode Separation Anxiety Nora was given a chance to move away from Pasadena but her love for her five children, particularly her relationship with Kitty, is so powerful that Nora was willing to give up the rest of her life to stay close to them. She begins to date a political friend of Kitty's named Isaac Marshall (played by Danny Glover), who is a widower with five children of his own. Though they seemingly fall in love, their relationship ends as his job as a political consultant keeps him on the road too much. She must then deal with the fallout that Rebecca isn't William's daughter and that he had another mistress and they had a son named Ryan Lafferty. =Season 3= The third season finds Nora organizing a garage sale in order to collect the money she needs to begin her charity. Justin was concerned about the sale because everything that belonged to William is given away. She also tricks the kids about reconstructing the house for charity. Saul decides to hire Ojai Food's original architect, Roger Grant (played by Nigel Havers), who is an architect to help re-construct the charity clinic. He and Nora have a short fling but she ends it when she learns that Roger is married, despite him telling her that he and his wife share an open marriage. Nora tells him that if she can't have all of him then she doesn't want to be with him. He then decides to divorce his wife to be with Nora, but she tells him that she can't be responsible for such a thing and to not divorce his wife just because it's what she wanted. =Season 4= In the fourth season, Nora helps her daughter, Kitty, deal with her cancer. She does all she can to keep her family together through such a hard time and is saddened when she learns that Tommy and Julia are getting a divorce. She and Holly come to blows as they try to plan Justin and Rebecca's wedding. Nora and Saul also receive a visit from their conservative mother, Ida. As Nora struggles to help Kitty through her cancer she meets an oncologist who has been volunteering at the clinic named Simon Craig. The fact that he is younger bothers Nora, but they eventually begin to date after some awkwardness. However, Kevin and Sarah discover Simon has been sued twice and may in fact have had his license revoked. After Nora gives Simon a large sum of money for his clinic, he seemingly loses interest in her; on the day of Justin and Rebecca's wedding, he calls her and tells her that he is unable to attend. He then runs off and goes missing for 6 weeks with her money. Sarah convinces her that he is a con- artist. Simon does return and gives Nora a story about his being sick and unable to move for six weeks. He manages to convince her to \\"take\\" him back. However, Sarah and the other Walker's remain hesitant about their relationship. After some more digging Sarah discovers that while Simon was \\"sick\\" he was actually in Boca romancing another widow. Before Sarah can tell Nora this, she refuses to hear any more gossip. When Simon comes over one afternoon to see Nora, she surprises both Simon and Sarah and reveals that she knows everything and as Simon tries to come up with some excuse, the police arrive and Simon is thoroughly trapped. It is later revealed by Saul that Simon went to jail. =Season 5= In the start of the fifth season Nora is worried about her children but does not get involved, resulting in Saul telling her that she's lost her voice and immediately sets her children straight. It is revealed that she has been working as a florist (however, Kitty believes and convinces everyone else that she's a lesbian leading Nora to say \\"What are you talking about? I'm not a lesbian, I'm a florist!\\") But quits her job and becomes a radio host for a show called 'Call Mom' giving motherly advice to people. Nora also starts a relationship with a radio psychologist named Karl. However, he struggles with how close Nora is with her children and they end their relationship.

Nora get the shocking news that her mother Ida Holden died, she breaks down and relied on her past love Nick Brody for strength. It was later revealed that she had an affair with Nick Brody, who is actually Sarah's biological father. At first Sarah wants nothing to do with Brody.

The name in Valencian is La Iessa, but the local language is Spanish, not Valencian. Geography The municipality covers an area of and as of 2011 had a population of 265 people. La Yesa is located north of Chelva and northwest of Valencia, off the provincial road CV-35 which links with the CV-345. It borders Abejuela of Aragon to the northeast. At an altitude of above sea level, the climate is dry continental, resulting in hot summers and cold winters (sometimes below 0 ¬∞C), where there is frequent snow. History Location in the comarca of Los Serranos The archaeological remains found in La Yesa attest to a settlement during Roman times. Alpuente and La Yesa were also coveted by the Cid, who seized the land in the late eleventh century. In the Muslim period it was part of the Taifa Kingdom of Alpuente(ninth century), being conquered by James I in 1236 and delivered to Juan de Au√±√≥n in 1238. In 1583, King Philip II of Spain granted the status of University and in 1587 it was declared an independent village. Economy The municipal economy revolves around agriculture and livestock. In 1611 wheat was reportedly sold for 110 sous in La Yesa. The town has a growing tourism sector on weekends and holidays, which has fueled the growth of several shops and bars. Kaolin mining and construction are the main industries. The municipality has close ties with the neighboring municipality of Alpuente, the town of which lies to the southwest of La Yesa. Notable landmarks Notable hermitages include Ermita de San Juan, Ermita de San Roque, Ermita de San Sebasti√°n (in disrepair) and the ruined Ermita de N¬™ S¬™ de Bel√©n. The principal church is the Iglesia de N¬™ S¬™ de los √Ångeles, which was completed in 1622 in the Renaissance style with a square tower. The church was burned down in 1840 following the Carlist Wars but was subsequently reconstructed, completed in 1852. To the left of the fa√ßade, recessed, stands the sturdy bell tower of ashlar masonry. Next to the Ermita de San Roque is the Monument to the Carlists, a cross composed of parts of a machine gun on an octagonal stone. The town contains the restaurants Tejer√≠a and Cerer√≠a.

Fuerte Bulnes. Fuerte Bulnes is a Chilean fort located by the Strait of Magellan, 62 km south of Punta Arenas. It was founded in 1843 on a rocky hill at Punta Santa Ana, under the command of President Manuel Bulnes Prieto. The fort was built to further the president's colonization policies in Southern Chile and protect the Strait of Magellan. He directed construction to ward off claims by other nations. Chilo√©'s intendant (governor), Domingo Espi√±eira Riesco, ordered construction of a schooner to sail to that location. He originally commissioned it in the president's name, but Bulnes had the ship renamed Goleta Ancud, for where it was built. She sailed from Ancud on May 22, 1843, under command of Commander John Williams Wilson, Chilean Navy. (British-born, he joined the Chilean Navy in 1824, where he used a Hispanic version of his name and signed documents as Juan Guillermos.) He arrived at Punta Santa Ana on September 21, 1843, about 2 km from Puerto del Hambre. He directed the construction of a fort here, using mainly logs and dirt and grass 'bricks'. Although the president wanted to establish a town, the harsh weather prevented attracting a large and stable population. As a result, after six years, the government founded Punta Arenas in the Sandy Point area in 1848. Once people had migrated there, military forces abandoned and destroyed the fort. Lieutenant Cambiazo supervised its burning. Between 1941 and 1943, the government directed the fort to be reconstructed as a historic monument. The replica includes the church, chaplain's quarters, jail, powder magazine, post office and stables. It was declared a national monument in 1968. Today, it is administered by a private company.

Traveling north to exit Ryderwood, the highway crosses Campbell Creek and enters Lewis County. The roadway parallels Stillwater Creek in its valley northeast and turns east to cross the creek into Vader.

It was originally known as The New Zealand Ballet Company. History New Zealand Ballet was established in 1953 as an independent charitable trust by Royal Danish Ballet Principal Poul Gnatt, Beryl Nettleton, Bettina Edwards, another female dancer, and pianist Dorothea Franchi. In the late 1950s notable New Zealand dancers Rowena Jackson and Philip Chatfield, her English dancer husband, returned from overseas to join the company. A third returning dancer, Russell Kerr, had been dancing in Europe with the Jose Greco Company since 1950, Sadlers Wells Ballet and Ballet Rambert, and from 1952 to 1957 with London Festival Ballet as their principal character dancer. In 1959 Kerr joined forces with NZ Ballet director Poul Gnatt, bringing with him a number of dancers from his own company, Auckland Ballet Theatre, for the 1959‚Äì60 season. As United Ballet, the augmented company presented a ground- breaking season which prefigured the things to come. Included amongst the classical works was a major contemporary work, \\"Prismatic Variations, a collaborative piece between Gnatt and Kerr, with guest artists the celebrated New Zealand dancers Rowena Jackson and Sara Neil. In 1962 Jon Trimmer returned to the company after studying at the Royal Ballet School in London and performing with the Sadlers Wells Company. He remains a leading artist with the company in 2007 and has performed many character roles over the last 20 years. Russell Kerr succeeded Gnatt as company director from 1962 to 1969. In the 1960s and 70s the company survived by touring extensively throughout the country. It has been directly funded by the New Zealand government (currently through the Ministry for Culture and Heritage) since 1998. In 1984 Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of New Zealand granted the title Royal to the company making it the fourth ballet company to receive this honour, along with The Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and Royal Winnipeg Ballet. In 2006 the company had 32 dancers, and in 2016 had 36. It performed nationally and overseas. In 2011, Ethan Stiefel (USA) became Artistic Director, and brought his partner, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Gillian Murphy, as a guest dancer and coach to the company during his tenure.

Plot Donald and his nephews are in Donald's car on vacation in Florida, and pass by an \\"old Spanish fort\\" and a flamingo. The nephews, however, are more interested in their comic book, refusing to look up from it. Donald's car begins to overheat, which sends him scrambling to find a source of water for his radiator. He comes across a small pond with a sign reading \\"This spring was mistaken for the Fountain Of Youth\\". Donald decides to use this to trick the boys, with the intent of making them believe Donald is experiencing dramatic reverse aging. Donald breaks off the top half of the sign, leaving only the bottom portion reading \\"The Fountain of Youth,\\" and yells for help to get the boys' attention. The boys find Donald wearing a baby bonnet and exhibiting baby-like behavior, including tearing pages from their comic book. \\"Baby\\" Donald's outlandish behavior causes the boys to decide that some discipline is called for, and the boys go off to find a tree branch to use as a switch. However, Donald uses this time to steal an egg from a nearby sleeping crocodile, place it where he had just been standing, and put his baby bonnet on it to fool the boys into thinking he has further regressed to an egg. Donald watches from a nearby hiding spot alongside the very crocodile he stole the egg from (who had just woken up from Donald sitting on her). As the boys lament losing their Uncle to the reverse aging process, Donald attempts to share a laugh with the crocodile, who soon discovers that her egg is missing and Donald is the culprit. Enraged, the crocodile whacks Donald on the head with her tail and a dazed Donald sits on her egg. She then chases the triplets for the egg and they throw it to coincidentally where Donald is. As Donald gets out of his daze from having the egg bounce off him, the two crocodile eggs hatch, imprinting the baby crocodiles into thinking Donald is in fact their mother. After further time spent evading the crocodile, Donald suffers a concussion that puts him into a stupor, after which the boys see him stumbling. Reuniting with the triplets, the baby crocodiles come up to Donald excitedly and Donald fears about them thinking he is their mother, so they run to the car and make a hasty exit. The babies begin to cry from Donald getting away. The crocodile is reunited with her babies, however due to their earlier imprinting onto Donald, they are terrified at the sight of their biological mother. The mother crocodile quacks, causing her babies to accept her after all.

This was because it is an excellent example of how medieval techniques in architectural design affected Episcopal church building in the United States in the 19th Century, in a style known as Gothic Revival.TEC NRHP Form History Trinity Episcopal Church, a member of the Episcopal Diocese of Lexington, was officially founded in 1829, although the first Episcopal church in Kentucky was built in 1796 in central Kentucky, known as \\"The Episcopal Society\\". The first Trinity Episcopal Church in Covington was a wooden structure with external walls of board and batten built in 1843, after $350 was spent to purchase the land.Trinity Episcopal Church - History The current building was constructed between 1857 and 1859. The timber and truss roof lies above a brick and stone masonry structure. An 1871 expansion had to be rebuilt in 1872 due to fire, with the mayor of Covington giving land to Trinity Episcopal Church in 1872 to assist. In 1885 a two-story guild hall was constructed to serve the church. Further additions in 1887 and 1888 included a new western front and a new nave bay, which allowed for a new baptistery and entry bell tower. The last enhancements to the building were in 1961 and 1962, which included an L-shaped annex of brick used for classrooms and offices. Governor of Kentucky and Senator, John W. Stevenson, belonged to Trinity Episcopal Church. The first public library in Covington was built by Trinity Episcopal. The church also started the Baker-Hunt Foundation, to teach both adults and children to appreciate art.

He served as the sixth bishop of Langres from 374 until his death. Saint Leodegaria was his sister. Urban was the bishop of Langres, France, beginning in 374. Legend states that soon after taking his position, political turmoil erupted, and he was driven from his house. St. Urban hid from his persecutors in a vineyard. The vine-dressers in the area concealed him, and he took the opportunity to convert them to Christianity. Those same vine-dressers then helped him in his covert ministry, as he moved from one town to another via their vineyards. Due to this work, and to Urban‚Äôs devotion to the Holy Blood, he developed great affection to all the people in the wine industry, and they for him. Urban is thus the patron saint of all those who work in the wine industry and is invoked against blight and alcoholism. Veneration The feast day of St. Urban is 2 April, or 23 January in Langres, France. The cult of St. Urban of Langres were closely associated with the weather.

Pesaha Appam or Inriyappam or Kurisappam is the unleavened Passover bread made by the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala, India to be served on night of Maundy Thursday. The white-ish Pesaha appam is a firm rice cake. It is made from rice batter like Palappam, but is different from palappam in that it is not fermented with yeast in its preparation. The meal also includes small banana variants in Kerala such as Poovan Pazham or Njalipoovan Pazham. The brown palkurukku is made mainly using jaggery and coconut milk. A cross is made using the palm leaves from Palm Sunday and placed it on the middle of the batter. Traditionally, Pesaha Appam is served in a ceremonial manner on Passover night in Saint Thomas Christian households. The head of the family cuts the appam, dips it in paalukurukku (syrup) or Pesaha Pal (Passover milk), and serves it to the other family members. The Pesaha Appam is derived from the ancient bread of Jewish tradition.Menachery, G., ed. (1973) The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopedia of India, B. N. K. Press, vol. 2, , Lib. Cong. Cat. Card.

This unleavened bread is prepared only for Passover and is called as Pesaha Appam or Passover unleavened bread. Pesaha celebration of Saint Thomas Christians strictly falls on Western Maundy Thursday and lasts only for a single day unlike Jewish passover which lasts for 7-8 days. Pesaha pal (passover coconut milk [‡¥™‡µÜ‡¥∏‡¥π‡¥æ ‡¥™‡¥æ‡µΩ]) is served along with Pesaha Appam on the night of Passover.

Background Steven Starr was born on Long Island. Starr started in high school as a volunteer journalist at WLIR in New York, pursued a degree in Radio, TV and Film at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and worked his way through college as a campus journalist, DJ, CBS Records college rep, and promoted concerts for Bob Marley & The Wailers. Career After starting in the mail room at the William Morris Agency in 1980, Starr launched their new media (home video and audiobooks) division in 1983. He went on to package television and screenplays, then headed the New York Motion Picture department under Sue Mengers. His clients over the years included Larry David, Ang Lee, Andy Warhol, Ziggy Marley, Sandra Bernhard, Andy Grove, Joseph Papp, Will Smith and Tim Robbins. Starr left Morris in 1991 to produce Johnny Suede, winner of the Golden Leopard at the Locarno International Film Festival, and to write, direct and produce Joey Breaker, winner of the Audience Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. He then co-created and produced the Ace Award series nominee The State for MTV and CBS, and collaborated with the Marley family on a variety of estate projects, including a Bob Marley biopic.Bob Marley biopic Starr went on to focus full-time on media democratization in 1999, as a co-founder of the Los Angeles Independent Media Center, and founding CEO of AntEye.com, a user-generated video site where video creators, voted on by their peers, were awarded micro-pilot budgets in various categories. Despite thousands of submissions and a first-look partnership with HBO, bandwidth costs were prohibitive, and by mid-2000 AntEye became unsustainable. Starr then co-founded Uprizer with Freenet Project founder Ian Clarke and Rob Kramer. Funded by Intel, the company's goal was to launch a zero-cost bandwidth solution for independent creators. After Hummer Winblad Venture Partners was named in the Napster lawsuits, Uprizer re- oriented as an enterprise software solution, Starr and Clarke departed to continue work on Freenet, and Uprizer sold to Redux Holdings. The Pacifica Foundation then approached Starr to reorganize KPFK, the largest progressive radio signal in the US. He then started ChangeTv, a user-generated digital cable network designed to filter online video onto cable and reward creators, advised by John Perry Barlow and Amnesty International's Jack Healy. Revver When financing proved difficult, Starr repurposed ChangeTv, bringing on Ian Clarke, Andrew Clarke, Oliver Luckett and Downhill Battle as consultants, focusing on how to reward online video creators in direct proportion to virality. After raising capital from the syndicate that funded Skype, Clarke and Luckett became co-founders and the Revver beta launched on October 29, 2005. Revver split advertising revenue 50/50 with creators, and gave 20% of advertising revenue to syndicators. Revver enabled redistribution under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.5 Creative Commons License. In 2006, Revver was awarded the Most Influential Independent Website by Television Week, nominated for an Advanced Technology Emmy Award, and honored as one of the 100 most promising startups by Red Herring. Revver's creator- centric business model had significant impact, forcing many video sites to begin offering revenue share to creators, including YouTube. In 2007, Revver announced it had paid out its first million dollars to online creators. In February 2008, Revver was sold to LiveUniverse, which abandoned the creator/syndicator revshare model, starting a precipitous decline in users. FLOW: For Love Of Water Starr went on to finalize production of Irena Salina's feature-length global water crisis documentary FLOW: For Love Of Water, and launch a Right To Water campaign to add a 31st article to the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights, Article31.org. FLOW premiered as a Grand Jury Prize nominee at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival Competition, going on to win a variety of festival awards, including the International Jury Prize at the Mumbai International Film Festival and the Grand Jury Award for Best Documentary at the United Nations Film Festival. FLOW was released theatrically by Oscilloscope Labs in September, 2008, and has since served as a water activist tool for the global Right To Water movement. FLOW was invited to screen for the UN General Assembly on the 60th Anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where the first 50,000 signatories to Article31 were presented to the President of the General Assembly, Father Miguel D'Escoto Brockmann. On July 28, 2010 a resolution was presented by Bolivia and co-sponsored by 35 countries, calling on the General Assembly to recognize the Right To Water. Despite opposition from the U.S., the U.K. and their allies, the resolution passed with the support of 122 countries, representing over 5 billion people. In 2010, a French court rejected a defamation lawsuit against FLOW brought by Suez Environnement, one of the largest water companies in the world. In 2012, Suez lost again on appeal and was forced by the court pay legal fees and damages. The Garden Starr then co-executive produced and organized theatrical distribution for the Academy Award-nominated, urban farming documentary The Garden. CitizenGlobal Starr then joined CitizenGlobal, to collaborate on the development of a media co-creation platform with Ward Cunningham among others, and ultimately became CEO, organizing social media initiatives for Occupy Wall Street, XPrize, Sierra Club, 350.org, Fremantle, Univision, Sesame Street, eBay, and Congo Woman‚Äôs Relief for Voice Of America. Spotlight Expose After going back to school for a Master's Degree in Spiritual Psychology, Starr broke a lifelong silence to share his childhood experiences at The Fessenden School as the lead of a 2016 Boston Globe Spotlight Team expose on sexual abuse, involving over 70 boarding schools and hundreds of victims. He keynoted with Spotlight at the 2017 National Sexual Assault Conference in Washington D.C., and has been working with survivors ever since.

Prelude In early July 1946, Hu Zongnan, the nationalist commander-in-chief of the 1st War Zone sent the nationalist Reorganized 1st Division and the Reorganized 27th Division northward to link up with the nationalist force from Linfen and Jiexiu (‰ªã‰ºë) under the command of Yan Xishan, the nationalist commander-in-chief of the 2nd War Zone, hoping that the nationalist would dislodge the communists controlling the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway. The communists under the command of Chen Geng and his political commissar Xie Fuzhi in turn, planned to annihilate the nationalists before they could link up with each other. The communist 4th Column of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan (ÊôãÂÜÄÈ≤ÅË±´) Military Region was tasked with this job with the help of units of the communist Taiyue (Â§™Â≤≥) Military Region. Order of battle Nationalists: *Reorganized 1st Division *Reorganized 27th Division *The 39th Division *The 69th Division Communists: *The 4th Column of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region *Units of the communist Taiyue (Â§™Â≤≥) Military Region Campaign On June 12, 1946, the nationalist Reorganized 27th Division and two brigades of the nationalist Reorganized 1st Division had pushed to Wenxi (ÈóªÂñú), Water Head Town (Shui Tou Zhen, Ê∞¥Â§¥Èïá), Embankment Palm Town (Yan Zhang Zhen, Â†∞ÊéåÈïá), and Summer (Xia, Â§è) County, and the nationalist advance guard had penetrated over 70 km into the communist dominated areas. On July 13, 1946, the communist 4th Column of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region concentrated two brigades to besiege the 31st Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 27th Division, while the rest of the troops were deployed to stop the nationalist reinforcement. By July 14, 1946, the 31st Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 27th Division was completely annihilated at Embankment Palm Town (Yan Zhang Zhen, Â†∞ÊéåÈïá) and the Town of Hu and Zhang (Hu Zhang Zhen, ËÉ°Âº†Èïá) regions. In the meantime, the nationalist reinforcement of the nationalist Reorganized 1st Division from Wenxi (ÈóªÂñú) and Water Head Town (Shui Tou Zhen, Ê∞¥Â§¥Èïá) to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms was also ambushed on its way and was forced to retreat. After suffering the defeat, the nationalist force under the command of Hu Zongnan was forced out of action and had to regroup by withdrawing to the Wenxi (ÈóªÂñú), Xia County, Shanxi and Anyi (ÂÆâÈÇë) regions. However, the nationalist force under the command of Yan Xishan was still on the move to the north in order to reinforce the nationalists in northern Shanxi participating in the Northern Shanxi Campaign. As the majority of the nationalist force was sent to the north, the regions along the Datong‚ÄìPuzhou Railway from Lingshi (ÁÅµÁü≥) to Hongtong was only defended by the nationalist 39th Division, 69th Division, and local security regiments. Taking the opportunity, the communist 4th Column of the Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region and units of the communist Taiyue (Â§™Â≤≥) Military Region joined their forces and launched another round of assaults on August 9, 1946, taking Hongtong, City of Zhao (Zhao Cheng, ËµµÂüé), Huo (Èúç) County, Lingshi (ÁÅµÁü≥) and Fenxi (Ê±æË•ø). The campaign finally concluded on September 1, 1946 when the communists took the region of Wealthy Family's Beach (Fu Jia Tan, ÂØåÂÆ∂Êª©). Outcome The nationalists had suffered over 15,000 casualties in their defeat, and not only they had failed to achieve their original objective of linking up with their comrades-in-arms, but the original gap in the nationalist defense had greatly increased as the result of the nationalist defeat. In contrast, the communist victory had completely severed the link between the nationalist force under the command of Hu Zongnan in the south and the nationalist force under the command of Yan Xishan in the north. The original gap between the two groups of the nationalist forces was greatly increased that there was no chance for the nationalists to link up again because a vast area along the 100 km southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway had fallen into communist hands.

He is most noted as a ballet dancer, having been a principal dancer with both the Royal Danish Ballet and the Royal Ballet in London, as well as making guest appearances with other ballet companies. Following his departure from the Royal Ballet in 2013, he was the artistic director of the Romanian National Ballet Company until 2016. Early life Johan Kobborg was born in Odense, Denmark into an artistic family; his mother is a former showgirl and actress and his brother is an actor. From a young age, he trained as a tenor, but left singing to take up dancing. Training Kobborg began his professional training at the late age of , attending the Royal Danish Ballet School, where he was tutored in the Bournonville method of classical dance. He graduated in 1991. Professional career After his graduation, Kobborg joined the Royal Danish Ballet and was promoted to the rank of principal dancer in 1994, following his debut in the role of James in La Sylphide. He joined the Royal Ballet in 1999, and has danced most of the leading parts in the repertory among them, the Prince (The Nutcracker, Cinderella), Siegfried, Romeo, Onegin, Albrecht, Oberon, Rudolf, Des Grieux, D√©sir√© and Prince Florimund. His guests appearances include dancing with the Mariinsky Ballet, Bolshoi Ballet, La Scala Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, Hamburg Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, Vienna State Opera Ballet and Teatro San Carlo, Naples. One of the highlights of his career is his partnership with Romanian ballerina, Alina Cojocaru. The partnership began in 2001 after the two danced in Romeo and Juliet together after Cojocaru filled in for an injured Miyako Yoshida. Since then, Kobborg and Cojocaru's partnership has been named one of the greatest of all time and has even been compared to the partnership of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. They have danced together not just at Covent Garden, but also worldwide due to international popularity. Despite media speculation that Kobborg would retire from the stage to replace Dame Monica Mason as Artistic Director of the Royal Ballet in 2012, it was later announced that Kevin O'Hare would be her successor. Kobborg previously declined an invitation to bid for the directorship of the Royal Danish Ballet, but in an article for the Daily Telegraph he stated that he would definitely accept such invitation to run the Royal Ballet. Following O'Hare's appointment, press speculation about Kobborg's long-term future with the company intensified. In June 2013, he announced that he and Cojocaru would leave The Royal Ballet at the end of 2012/13 season. Their last performance in London was in Mayerling on 5 June, his 41st birthday, followed by scheduled performances on 10 and 12 July with the company in Tokyo. In December 2013, Kobborg became the Artistic Director of the Romanian Nation Ballet Company in Bucharest, for which he was given a four-year contract. Cojocaru also joined the company as a principal dancer. However, in 2016, actions by new leadership at the Bucharest National Opera House resulted in both Kobborg and Cojocaru resigning, triggering protests by dancers. The new management then apparently banned them from even setting foot in the theatre. Kobborg's Romeo & Juliet, premiered in the Arena di Verona on 26 August 2019 and attended by more than 10,000 members of the audience from all over the world was considered a great success. Music by Sergei Prokofiev (but shorten to one and half-hour), scenography by David Umemoto and with performers such as Sergei Polunin, Alina Cojocaru, Valentino Zucchetti, Nikolas Gaifullin, etc., the show won overwhelming praises. One critic wrote, \\"‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Kobborg has created graceful and appropriate dances for the various gatherings: elegant for the ballroom; impressive in the fight scenes; mournful at the funeral procession. A complementary chorus for the two leading protagonists. The ballet is set in a society without time and place, and this is underlined by the costumes ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Very glamorous fashion show ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Even David Umemotot‚Äôs scenery isolates us from any sense of time or geographical setting ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Fifteen minutes of applause and a standing ovation.....\\".Bonelli, Valetina, \\"Romeo & Giulietta: reviews for Johan Kobborg‚Äôs new ballet for Polunin Ink\\", Dance Europe, issue 243, October 2019, p.50. Another wrote: \\"Critics and audience alike were wowed at the sensational world premiere of the ballet in the Arena di Verona ...... Johan Kobborg's version of the world's greatest love story marries classical dance with a contemporary twist to create a dynamic, vibrant and modern re-telling of this ageless drama of all-consuming love, passion, ecstasy and heartbreak. Set to Prokofiev's powerful, exquisite score, and with a striking stage set design by Canadian-based sculptor David Umemoto, the story follows the narrative of Shakespeare's play with the classical ballet vocabulary as its core language.\\" Awards Kobborg has also been the recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including the Nureyev International Competition (Grand Prix 1994), USA International Competition, Jackson, USA (Grand Prix 1994) and the Erik Bruhn Competition (1993) and received a 2006 Laurence Olivier Award nomination for his production of La Sylphide. On DVD Kobborg's performance as Albrecht in Giselle, alongside Alina Cojocaru as the title role was recorded in 2006 and aired in England on Boxing Day. It was released on DVD the following year. He choreographed the dance scene in the film The White Crow (2018), a Rudolf Nureyev biopic directed by Ralph Fiennes. Personal life Kobborg lives with his fianc√©e, Alina Cojocaru. Following the formation of their partnership, it was officially confirmed in 2005 that they were having a romantic relationship off-stage. In May 2011, whilst Cojocaru was making a guest appearance with the American Ballet Theatre, her dance partner was injured so Kobborg flew to New York City unexpectedly to fill in and surprised Cojocaru when he proposed to her on her 30th birthday at the Metropolitan Opera House. Their engagement was announced shortly afterwards. In May 2017, Cojocaru announced on Twitter that she and Kobborg are expecting their first child. On 10 October 2017, Kobborg announced via Twitter that Cojocaru had given birth to their daughter Thalia Chulpan. On 31 July 2020, Cojocaru announced on Twitter that the couple are expecting their second child.

The campaign was fought in the post-World War II era in the eastern Gansu province in northwestern China during the Chinese Civil War, and it was one of the few conflicts from which the nationalists emerged as the victor. Prelude After Panlong Campaign, the communist force under the command of Peng Dehuai in northwest China had scored three consecutive victories against its nationalist adversary, and had forced the nationalists in northwestern China to cease further offensives. Both sides took rest and the communists held a celebration at Ansai () region during this break. Zhou Enlai personally went to join the celebration on Mao Zedong's behalf and suggested that Peng's force should take the opportunity to take a much-needed break while the nationalists were resting, but Peng Dehuai disagreed because Ansai region was a very poor region lacked any resources and thus could not support his large army numbered over twenty thousands. Instead, Peng Dehuai suggested that his force should strike toward eastern Gansu while the local nationalist force under the command Hu Zongnan was resting, so that the communists could replenish themselves in the newly conquered area in eastern Gansu. When Peng's suggestion was finally telegraphed to Mao Zedong on May 14, 1947, Mao replied in the same day and agreed. Peng Dehuai also hoped that taking eastern Gansu would force the Ma clique to redeploy its forces and thus provide an opportunity for another communist victory, as he and Xi Zhongxun had told Mao in their telegraph on May 28. Little did the communists know how wrong they were. On May 21, 1947, the communists started their push toward eastern Gansu in three fronts from Ansai region under the personal command of Peng Dehuai: the communist 1st Column was at the right, and the Newly Organized 4th Brigade was at the central, while the 2nd Column under the command of Wang Zhen was at the left. The town of Heshui () in the nationalist hands was selected as the primary target due to the following reasons: the region was originally an area of active communist guerrilla activities before World War II and at the end of Long March, it was the place where Mao Zedong's force met with local Chinese Red Army commanded by Xie Zichang () and Liu Zhidan (). During World War II, the region was granted by the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek to the communists as their area of control, so that the communists were legally allowed to station its 358th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army under the command of Wang Hongqian () in the region and turn it into a communist base. The communist 358th Brigade headquartered at Qingyang () while the communist 770th Regiment under the command of Zhang Caiqian () was stationed at Heshui It was only after World War II were the nationalists finally able to retake the region from the communists and the communists had hoped that they would be able to take the region again from the nationalists. First stage After the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division was annihilated by the enemy in the Battle of Xihuachi, the nationalists lacked sufficient troops to fill the new gaps in their defense. As a result, the remaining nationalist garrison was gravely overstretched and the nationalist northern flank was dangerously exposed. In order to boost local defense, the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to Pingliang in eastern Gansu in early 1947. To strengthen the defense of the triangular region bordered by regions of Western Peak (Xi Feng, ), Ning ) County, and Zhenyuan (), the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade (without its Heavy Weaponry Battalion and its 1st Regiment) of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to Qingyang. The 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to Red City (Chi Cheng, ), southeast of Qingyang. The Heavy Weaponry Battalion of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was tasked to defend Heshui with the help of the Gansu 2nd Security Regiment. The Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to Zhengning (). The 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 100th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to Ning County, and the 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 100th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to the town of Early Victory (Zao Sheng, ), and the 3rd Regiment of the Reorganized 100th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to the town of Zhenyuan. Qinghai 1st Security Cavalry Regiment was deployed to Jingchuan (), while Qinghai 2nd Security Cavalry Regiment was tasked to defend Pingliang with the help of 2nd Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. The 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade and other units of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division including the field hospital, the engineering battalion, the communication battalion, the transportation company, the garrison group and others were deployed to Western Peak and Xiaojing () regions. After the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division had pushed toward eastern Gansu, the nationalists had successfully driven the local communist guerillas into the mountains of Meridian Ridge (Zi Wu Ling, ) in four weeks by taking advantage of their cavalry and the adaptation of their own guerrilla tactic against communist guerillas. Although the nationalists were expecting the enemy would attack in great numbers eventually, they had not anticipated the assault by the enemy main force would come so soon, and thus initially believed it was just the enemy guerillas grouped together for a counterattack, instead of the main force of the regular communist army. The defenders of Heshui, nonetheless, was well armed to take care themselves: the Heavy Weaponry Battalion of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division at Heshui included an infantry support gun company, an anti-tank gun company, a heavy machine gun company and a communication platoon, and the battalion is one of the best unit among Ma clique's forces that were experts in urban defense. The Heavy Weaponry Battalion of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was further assisted by the Gansu 2nd Security Regiment whose troops were all locals who were very familiar with local terrain. The nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division Ma Jiyuan () had so much confident in this urban defense garrison of 1,300 men that he deployed them in the exposed town of Heshui, and history would later prove that he was right and his men would not disappoint him. Order of battle Defenders: nationalist order of battle * Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division *Garrison Group (Regiment) of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division *Gansu 2nd Security Regiment Attackers: communist order of battle *359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column *Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column *Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column Second stage The detachments of communist 2nd Column under the command of Wang Zhen crossed Meridian Ridge and approached the town of Heshui. The 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was assigned to take the town while the Instructional Brigade and the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column were tasked to ambush the reinforcement. As the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade reached the Wormwood Grass Shop (Hao Cao Pu, ) area of Luo Er Plateau (Luo Er Yuan, ) region 10 km from Heshui, the communist scouts ahead were ambushed by the local nationalist cavalry on patrol. In a brief but fierce battle, a communist scout was captured alive by the nationalist cavalry. The communists feared that their plan was to be compromised, and attempted to rescue the captured scout, but Luo Er Plateau was a place extremely difficult to take but very easy to defend due to its terrain, and the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was forced to abort their futile attempts and move to the planned destination. The attackers therefore lost the element of surprise. At 4:00 AM on May 28, 1947, the 717th Regiment of the 359th Brigade made contact with nationalist garrison of Heshui to the northwest of the town, and all nationalists outside the town soon retreated behind the city wall. The commander of the Heavy Weaponry Battalion of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division, Ma Shengzhi (), radioed the headquarters of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division at the town of Western Peak, claiming that the battle had already been raged on. By the evening of May 28, 1947, Ma Shengzhi radioed for help again, claiming that large enemy force was approaching the town of Heshui. The enemy attackers were headed by Guo Peng (), the commander of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. The 12th Regiment of the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was also sent to join the assault on the town. The 717th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column attack the town from northwest, while the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade and the 12th Regiment of the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column attacked the town from the east, and the 719th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was kept as reserve. However, the attacking communists were prevented from approaching the city wall, and it was not until the morning when the attacking enemy discovered why: the city wall extended toward a plateau to the northwest of the town, and defenders atop of the city wall on this plateau had perfect firing positions that could effectively block any attackers' advance toward the town. The defenders had deployed not only mortar and anti-tank guns, but several heavy machine guns as well. After futile attacks that lasted for an entire day and night, the attackers finally realized that this extension must be taken but with the current strength they had, they were simply unable to achieve this impossible task, and Guo Peng, the commander of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, who was in the southwestern suburb of the town directing the battle, and he had no choice but to deploy the reserve, the 719th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column ahead of schedule to attack the extension. By the noon of May 29, 1947, the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade and the 12th Regiment of the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column were able to take nationalist strongholds in the east and south just outside the city wall, and Eastern Pass (Dong Guan, ) of the town fell into the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column by the afternoon. After preparation, the 719th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column launched its assault on the northwestern extension of the nationalist defense, but the defenders would not let them succeed: while the enemy was busy attacking, the defenders sent out a large force via tunnels to counterattack the attacking enemy from behind, and inflicted heavy casualties on the communist attackers, which was forced to halt their attack. The stubborn and successful nationalist defense of the town of Heshui was completed unexpected by the enemy, who was hoping for an easy victory, and Wang Zhen, the commander of the communist 2nd Column, had to go to the front line to direct the combat himself. By the evening, the battle mainly continued at the southern sections of the city wall and enemy artillery heavily shelled the nationalist positions in the night. By midnight, the attacking enemy had blown away all of the obstacles outside, but failed to blow up the gate and a section of city wall as they had hoped, and the charging enemy force discovered that there were no gaps they could utilize after reaching the city wall. Taking the advantage, the defenders mobilized everyone including cooks and medics to launch an all-out counterattack, again inflicting heavy casualties on the trapped enemy at the foot of the city wall, especially the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade and the 12th Regiment of the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the defenders had successfully beaten back the enemy once again. The defenders suffered heavily in the counterattack, with the commander of the nationalist Gansu 2nd Security Regiment, Li Hongxuan (), badly wounded in the battle. The attackers would later learn after the campaign that the same extension of the urban defense that prevented them from taking the town had also prevented Li Zicheng from doing so three hundred years before for three times, and it was only after the extension was neutralized, that Li Zicheng and his peasantry army were able to finally succeed in taking the town of Heshui. Third Stage On May 29, 1947, the news of the enemy besieging the town of Heshui had finally struck the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division guarding the town of Western Peak, Ma Jiyuan, who realized this was not a concentration of enemy guerillas attempting to harassing the local garrison, so he ordered the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade at Qingyang to reinforce the besieged town, under the leadership of its brigade commander Ma Buluan (), with the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade as the advance guard. The 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade was originally the nationalist 1st Cavalry Division which was later renamed as the 8th Cavalry Division during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and it was stationed in eastern Henan, fighting countless battles with the Japanese invaders who grew to respect the nationalist cavalry unit, calling it \\"Ma's Islamic Division\\". After World War II, the unit returned to Qinghai from Xuzhou and was subsequently reorganized as the 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. When the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to eastern Gansu during the Chinese Civil War, the 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was deployed to the town of Red City (Chi Cheng, ) 15 km southeast of Qingyang. However, units of the Independent Brigade of the communist 2nd Column had already infiltrated into regions south of Qingyang, and unaware of the enemy strength, the nationalists did not want to risk being ambushed on the way, so they decided to concentrate their forces by going to Qingyang after leaving Red City. As a result, when the nationalist reinforcement finally begun their march toward Heshui, it was already late in the evening. In order to save time, the nationalists took a route in a valley 15 km to the east of Qingyang without sending out scouts ahead. Around the same time the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade left Qingyang to reinforce Heshui on May 29, 1947, the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column reached Cypress Plateau, the chokepoint of the traffic to Heshui. The exhausted communists did not even bother to build any temporary fortifications. Luo Shaowei (), the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column deployed the 3rd Battalion of the regiment to the south of the road, while the 2nd Battalion was deployed atop Northern Plateau (Bei Yuan, ) in the north, while the 1st Battalion acted as reserve. With the exception of a single platoon on guard, the rest of the exhausted communists camped in the open and went to sleep. At 5:00 AM on May 30, 1947, the nationalist reinforcement approached the communist camp, and made contact with the communist platoon on guard. Once hearing the gunshots, the communists immediately jumped to their feet and 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was the first one to act. Zhang Peiran (), and Qiu Deshan (), the commander and the political commissar of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column immediately organized their troops and directed machine gun and mortar crew to fire at the nationalists. Zhu Zhongxin (), the political commissar of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was just getting up to urinate when the battle broke out, and he immediately woke up his troops and with the help of Zhang Shunguo (), the battalion commander, led their battalion to reinforce their comrades. The sudden contact with the enemy was equally unexpected by and surprising the nationalists when they were moving fast in the valley. Ma Buluan (), the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade immediately ordered his troops to take the high ground on both sides to avoid being pinned down by the enemy. The advance guard of the nationalist reinforcement led by the company commander Ma Guochen () climbed to the top of Southern Plateau (Nan Yuan, ), while the rest of the nationalists climbed to the top of Northern Plateau. At the dawn, the nationalist main force atop Northern Plateau had beaten back the attack by the 3rd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, and the nationalist advance guards atop Southern Plateau originally appeared to be also successful in beating back the attack of the Garrison Platoon of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. However, the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column reached in time and helped their comrades to counterattack, surrounding the nationalist advance guards in three sides. The nationalist main force atop Northern Plateau could not provide fire support to their comrades-in-arms because the two sides were engaged in close quarter combats, and Lieutenant Colonel Suo Shijun () lead a team of three dozen men charged the enemy, successfully disrupted the enemy's counterattack and thus allowed the besieged nationalist advance guards to escape. However, by this time, one third of the 400+ strong nationalist advance guards had already been lost, and the company commander Ma Guochen who led the nationalist advance guards lost both his legs due to enemy fire. The nationalists was forced to a temporary retreat and headed back to Qingyang. Fourth Stage At Heshui, the 719th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column spent a day and a night to attack the town without any success. The political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao () reached the positions held by the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column in person in order to discuss the next move with Guo Peng (), the commander of the communist 359th Brigade in the morning of May 30, 1947. One suggestion was to take concentrate all available force to take the town first and then attack the hill to the north, but this suggestion was turned down by Guo Peng, the commander of the communist 359th Brigade, because if the strategic position of Northern Hill was not taken, the communists would be driven out of the town even if the town had been taken. The dispute reached Wang Zhen, the commander of the communist 2nd Column and he telephoned back that he agreed with Guo Peng, giving his permission to attack the Northern Hill to at the northern edge of the town. After an entire day of preparation, the communists renewed their assault on the town in the evening with the 717th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column as the main attacker, assisted by a detachment of the 719th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. However, heavy rain had helped the defenders to beaten back numerous assaults launched by the attackers, inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers. The political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao () wrote in his diary later to record the blunders committed by the attacking communists which resulted in failure and the first was the uncompromising doctrine strictly followed: once the proved to be ineffective, nobody thought about changing the tactic, instead, the ineffective tactic was continued. Once reaching the enemy, no temporary fortifications were built and personnel were exposed under direct fire. During the assault, nobody crawled, thus providing defenders with excellent target in the standing up position, and nobody had hit the dirty when the defenders had thrown hand grenades among the attackers. The communist artillery shelling was disorganized and could not coordinate with infantry. There was a general lack of knowledge of taking cover in favorable terrain and thus the defenders had easy time of targeting and aiming. The communist casualty was so high that even an experienced veteran like the political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao who had been in many fierce battles and campaigns was shocked. Behind the city wall, the defenders considered that they had suffered equally bad. The Heavy Weaponry Battalion of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade alone suffered more than three hundred casualties, including many company level and platoon level commanders. Both the commander and the deputy commander of the anti-tank gun company were severely wounded by the enemy shelling, losing their legs. The regimental commander of the nationalist Gansu 2nd Security Regiment, Li Hongxuan (), was also wounded. The most serious setback for the defenders, however, was that the only radio in the town was destroyed in the battle so the besieged town lost contact with other nationalist units. Fifth Stage After retreating to Qingyang, the nationalists regrouped, and planned for another attempt to reinforce the besieged town of Heshui. Ma Buluan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, had a new plan for the next move and his plan was supported by Ma Jiyuan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. Ma Buluan was very happy that his new plan was approved and immediately ordered his troops to set out again at noon on May 30, 1947, after reaching Qingyang two hours ago, and this time the nationalists were better prepared: Tan Shilin (), the local security chief of Qingyang and other locals went along as guides, and the nationalists found trails that lead to Heshui from Qingyang via the Willow Ditch (Liu Gou, ) area of Northern Plateau region. The 1st Company and the 2nd Company of the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade were the advanced guards. In the meantime, the enemy also made new deployment: the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was ordered to immediately join the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column who had beaten back the first nationalist reinforcement attempt and both communist brigades set up a defense at Vesper Col (Tai Bai Ao, ) region in order to check the advance of the nationalist reinforcement for a second time. On May 30, 1947, Hu Zongnan sent an airplane from Xi'an at noon to check if the nationalists were still fighting in Heshui. After confirming that the town was still firmly in the nationalist hands, the sole airplane dropped the few bombs on the enemy positions outside the city wall, though all of them had missed their targets because the pilot was forced to pull up to the high altitude in order to avoid enemy ground fire. The nationalist reinforcement was sent in three fronts, and the main force of 2,000 consisted of the 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division and the Garrison Group of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division. The 2nd Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was originally organized as the 2nd Cavalry Division during the Second Sino- Japanese War to be sent to central China to fight the Japanese invaders, but they were sent in Shaanxi by Hu Zongnan to blockade communist base. After the end of World War II, the nationalist 2nd Cavalry Division returned to Qinghai, along with nationalist 8th Cavalry Division returning from Xuzhou. The nationalist 2nd Cavalry Division was subsequently reorganized as 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, and in May 1947, the unit was selected to reinforce the besieged town of Heshui. The nationalist commander of the campaign, Ma Jiyuan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division selected his uncle, Ma Bufang's brother-in-law, Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi, the deputy commander of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division to be in charge of all of the nationalist reinforcement forces, and his assistant was the divisional staff officer Han Youlu (), who was the original regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade. One reason why Han Youlu was also sent was because Li Wenbin (), his replacement after his promotion was selected by the Ma Buluan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, but Li Wenbin, the new regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, was not a Muslim and thus might have difficulties in commanding the Muslim troops who were subordinates of Han Youlu, the former regimental commander. Sixth Stage The nationalist reinforcement of the central front under the direct command of the deputy commander of the Reorganized 82nd Division, Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi () left the town of Western Peak (Xi Feng, ), then passed the Relay Station Horse Pass (Yi Ma Guan, ), and three hours after the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade under the command of the brigade commander Ma Buluan left Qingyang for the second time, the nationalist reinforcement of the central front also reached town. After a brief stop, the nationalist reinforcement of the central front continued its push toward Heshui by taking the road from Qingyang to Ning County. In order to avoid mistakes made by Ma Buluan, Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi () ordered his troops to proceed along the mountain ridge after passing Banqiao. By 6:00 PM, the nationalist reinforcement had reached the Vesper Col region, which was guarded by the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. At the evening, the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column at the Southern Plateau on the left flank made contact with the advancing nationalist cavalry. The 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column had defeated the 1st Regiment of the Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade in the morning and thus was eager to score another victory. Cui Yongchen (), the commander of the 7th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column ordered to have the advance guard of the nationalist cavalry machined, and the nationalist cavalry behind consequently retreated. As the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column at the Northern Plateau heard the gun shots and immediately move joined the battle, blocking the passage of the nationalists. As the prudent Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi who was in command of the nationalist reinforcement discovered that there were enemy in three directions of the Vesper Col region in the east, south, and north, he ordered Li Wenbin (), the regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade to take charge of the nationalist force in the south, and Han Youlu (), the deputy commander in charge of the nationalist reinforcement to take charge of the nationalist force in the north to check the enemy's attack. However, the communist attack was simply too ferocious and the nationalist cavalries were forced into a disorganized retreat. Lieutenant General Ma Quanyi personally led the Garrison Squadron to launch a counterattack, but he was shot in the leg, and was hurriedly carried away by his bodyguards, and thus was forced out of action for the rest of the campaign. At the Southern Plateau are of the Vesper Col region, the 7th Company and the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column had successfully besieged the nationalist cavalries and seeing there was no way to escape, the nationalists deployed a fake surrender tactic by laying down their arms and raised their hands while kneeing down beside their horses after dismounted. Wu Baoliang (), the company commander of the 8th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column ordered the communists to cease fire and approached the kneeing nationalists to accept the surrender, while Luo Shaowei () and Xiong Guangyan (), the commander and the deputy commander of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column also approached the nationalists with regimental staff officers to observe the acceptance of the supposed surrender. However, as the communist soldiers approached, the kneeing nationalists suddenly picked up their weapons and opened up on the unsuspecting communists, and as the communists were mauled down, the nationalists quickly jumped up their horses and taking the advantage they inflicted on the enemy, charged out of the siege in chaos, successfully escaped. As soon as the nationalists had opened up on the approaching communists, Luo Shaowei, the commander of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column immediately ordered his staff officers behind him to take cover, but he was struck by a bullet fired by the nationalist, and the bullet penetrated his body, continued on, striking Xiong Guangyan (), the deputy commander of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column behind him, severely wounding both of them. Several hours later, after Luo Shaowei was carried away for medical treatment, he met Luo Yuanfa (), the commander of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, and the communist commander of the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column vexedly told his brigade commander: > These bastards were so slick that one shot from them took two of us out!. Seventh Stage The 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was also fooled by the fake surrender tactic adopted by another group of nationalists. Over two hundred cavalries from the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade had hidden in a large Yaodong with several troops waving white flags just outside the door. The 1st Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column believed the nationalists and the entire company went forward to accept the supposed surrender, but they were ambushed as two hundred cavalries suddenly charged out the large Yaodong and attacked the unsuspecting communist, and over thirty troops, including He Dadao (), the company commander were killed and the rest of the communist company was scattered. Taking advantage of the successful surprise attack, the nationalist cavalries continued to charge the communist positions which were dangerously undermanned as a result of loss the 1st Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. The political commissar of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, Guan Shengzhi () took a pistol from his bodyguard and shouted:‚ÄùCounterattack! Nobody is allowed to retreat!‚Äù while firing pistols in both hands, charging the enemy, followed by his comrades. In the meantime, the deputy political commissar of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Shi (), ordered the heavy weaponry company of the regiment to concentrate its fire on the attacking nationalist cavalry. Under the command of Ma Huiyuan (), the commander of the heavy weaponry company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, the communist defenders managed to inflict heavy casualties on the attacking nationalist cavalries but before completely stopping the attacking nationalists, the ammunition ran out. The communist defenders were forced into close quarter battles with the attacking nationalists and both Ma Huiyuan, the commander of the heavy weaponry company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column and Li Fengming (), the commander of the 8th Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column were wounded, but the nationalist attack was beaten back once again, and the position was still firmly in the communist hands. After the retreat, the nationalists of the central front regrouped and launched another round of attack, still targeting the enemy position held by the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column while the nationalist forces on the other two fronts moved toward the flanks of the target respectively held by the 1st Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column and the Independent 4th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column. The situation was critical and the political commissar of the communist Instructional Brigade, Yao Zhengxi () personally went to the front to the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column to command. The 8th Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column was at the most forward position and its commander, Li Fengming () was severely wounded an hour ago in battle, and Zhang Shengke (), the political commissar of the company had to take over, and held a political conference to boost morale. During the next nationalist cavalry charge, the communist defenders were initially successful in inflicting heavy casualties on the attacking nationalists under the command of the political commissar of the 2nd Regiment of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column, Guan Shengzhi (). In the ensuing battle, when the political commissar was observing the enemy movements via binoculars, he was positively identified by the nationalist snipers and consequently was shot in the right arm. However, the communists were able to quickly send the political commissar back for medical treatment and replace him with a new commander, because the Luo Yuanfa (), the commander of the Instructional Brigade of the communist 2nd Column had just reached the defenders in time to take over. Wei Zhiming (), the political commissar of the 1st Regiment of the communist Instructional Brigade noticed that the position of the communist 2nd Regiment was in danger of being overrun, and thus personally led several companies to reinforce their comrades by charging the left flank of the attacking nationalist cavalries. The charge was successful and nationalists were unable to launch anymore attacks but the communists were equal worn out. By the evening, a heavy rain provided the a badly needed break for both sides, and it also prevented the communists from engaging the nationalist reinforcement in another front: the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade was also ordered by Ma Jiyuan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division to reinforce the besieged Heshui. The nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade moved out from its base in Ning County at noon on May 30, 1947, and by the evening, heavy rain prevented it from going any further and Tan Chengxiang (), the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade ordered his soaked troops to stop and camp at Banqiao, 10 km away from Heshui. Despite the sound of guns could be heard, the cautious nationalists were careful not to proceed any further and avoided possible night fighting, a favorite tactic of the enemy. Eighth Stage On May 30, 1947, the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade went to reinforce Heshui again from Qingyang. Ma Buluan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade found a local resident as a guide, eventually reached the first line of the communist defense to the north of Heshui via Willow Ditch area of Northern Plateau region. The enemy position was manned by the 13th Regiment of the communist Independent 4th Brigade, and advanced guard of the nationalist reinforcement, the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade had already sent out its 1st Company and 2nd Company on foot toward the flanks of the enemy position under the cover of the dense foliage of the wheat field that had not been harvested yet. Ma Buluan the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade discovered that there was a portion of enemy position on top of a stretch of cliff of 4 meters to 5 meters tall, and decided to hide an assault team under the cliff to launch a surprise attack under the cover of heavy artillery shelling. Under the command of Ma Fushou, the staff officer sent from the headquarters of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division to help Ma Buluan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade, the 1st Company and the 2nd Company of the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade crawled to the bottom of the cliff under the cover of smoke from artillery shelling and then climbed up the cliff in two places. As the nationalist shelling had stopped, the troopers of the 1st Company and the 2nd Company of the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade charged into the enemy and started a fierce close quarter combat. In the meantime, the nationalist cavalry immediately charged the enemy position from different side in support of their comrades- in-arm. The communists could not stop the nationalist assault and were forced into retreat after abandoning their positions. The nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade chased the retreating enemy all the way until the nightfall, and then Ma Buluan, the commander of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade ordered his exhausted troops to stop and camp, despite the fierce battle was still raging on at Heshui. The communists attacking Heshui did not take any break and Wang Zhen, the commander-in-chief of the communist 2nd Column still wanted to take the city. Three regiments of the communist 359th Brigade and the 12th Regiment of the communist 4th Independent Brigade attacked the city for three times, but all failed due to heavy rain. The communist 718th Regiment planned to join the fight by 8:00 PM on the same day, but this was also delayed due to heavy rain. The headquarters of the communist 2nd Column informed its Instructional Brigade and Independent 4th Brigade that the 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade had approached Heshui (ÂêàÊ∞¥), and the two communist brigades launched a huge assault on the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade that lasted well into the night, but fierce battle had worn out both sides. Han Youlu (), the nationalist deputy commander in charge of the overall reinforcement operation took control of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade because Li Wenbin (), the regimental commander of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade was absent, accurately deduced that something happened at Heshui, and the enemy would withdrew. Surely enough, by next morning, the nationalists discovered that under the cover of darkness and rain, the communists had withdrawn, and the cautious nationalists did not pursuit for fearing enemy ambush. In contrast to the combatant in the fierce battle, the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade at Banqiao to the west of the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized Cavalry 8th Brigade was able to finally rest comfortably for a night and enjoyed their breakfast in the morning of May 31, 1947. At 10:00 AM, under the brigade commander Tan Chengxiang (), the entire brigade begun their move toward Heshui, and on its way, they were joined by the Garrison Group of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division and then continued prudently to reinforce the Heshui. Ninth Stage In the morning of May 31, 1947, the rain was not as heavy as the previous day and the communist 359th Brigade resumed its assault on the city. The commander-in-chief of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Zhen, personally directed the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade of the communist 2nd Column to attack the southern gate of the city. The communist 718th Regiment had assaulted the southern gate several times without any success on May 29, 1947, and although the last attack in the morning on May 30, 1947, was successful in eliminating all of the obstacles, the attackers' attempt to blow up the gate itself was not successful. On their renewed attack on May 31, 1947, the communist attackers learned from past experience and assaulted the southern gate of the city in two places simultaneously: one team climbed the ladder to the top of the city wall in the rain to distract the defenders while the other team attempted to blow up the gate on the same time. The tactic worked and the communists were finally able to breach the city wall after an hour of fierce battle. The 718th Regiment of the communist 359th Brigade and a battalion of the 12th Regiment of the communist Independent 4th Brigade charged into the city via the gap. After two hours of fierce fighting and suffering heavy casualties, the communist attackers were finally able to force the defenders into northern section of the city. Wang Zhen, the commander of communist 2nd Column telephoned the political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao () who was at the headquarters of the communist 359th Brigade in the northwestern suburb of the city to return to the headquarters of the communist 2nd Column located in the eastern suburb of the city and told the political commissar that the communists still planned to take the city by the morning. However, this was not to be and things had turned for the worse for the communist attackers. The 1st Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade suddenly appeared in the northern suburb of Heshui, which was totally unexpected by the communists attacking the city. Guo Peng, the commander of the communist 359th Brigade who was in charge of taking the city immediately ordered a company from the 717th Regiment and another from the 718th Regiment to check the advance of the nationalist reinforcement, but it was already too late. There were no suitable positions for the two communist companies and the best position hastily selected was within the range of defenders' heavy machine gun setup on the city wall. Once the nationalist reinforcement started its charge on the communist positions, it was notice by the defenders on the city wall, who immediately opened up on the communists in attempt to help the nationalist cavalry outside the city wall. The two communist companies were incapable of stopping the nationalist reinforcement when attacked from both the front and back, and not only they lost their positions, most of the troops were killed as well. To the northwest of the city, Guo Peng, the commander of the communist 359th Brigade who was in charge of taking the city, hastily ordered the last communist reserve, the 3rd Battalion of the 717th Regiment of the communist 359th Brigade to stop the nationalist reinforcement, but before the communist 3rd battalion had reached its designated position, the nationalist cavalry reinforcing the city met the battalion head on while in march. The nationalist cavalry immediately launched an attack on its communist enemy and attempted to charge the communist headquarters. After heavy casualties, the communist 3rd battalion was finally able to stop the nationalist cavalry charge. Although the 3rd Battalion of the 717th Regiment of the communist 359th Brigade managed to stop the nationalist cavalry charge to the communist headquarters, it was incapable of stopping the nationalist reinforcement from reaching the city wall. The defenders opened the northern gate and the heavy machine gun company of the heavy weaponry battalion of the nationalist Reorganized 8th Brigade charged out of the city wall from their defensive positions and successfully linked up with over three hundred cavalries, the advance guard of the nationalist reinforcement. Guo Peng, the commander of the communist 359th Brigade was anxious to cut the link between the nationalist defenders of the city and their reinforcement and decided to personally lead the counterattack on the nationalist reinforcement. However, as soon as he stepped out of the shelter, he was struck in the arm by a heavy machine gun bullet fired by the defenders on the city wall, severing the artery and knocked him out cold. As a result, not only the planned counterattack did not materialize, the attackers also lost their command and resulted in chaos. With the enemy in chaos and reinforcement pouring in from the north gate, the defenders' morale was instantly boosted and a large scale counterattack was immediately launched. The communist force consisted of a battalion of the 12th Regiment of the communist Independent 4th Brigade and the 718th Regiment of the communist 359th Brigade inside the city was annihilated by the renewed counterattack by the defenders. The highest ranked commanders for both communists units, Wu Huamin (), the chief-of-staff of the 12th Regiment of the communist 4th Brigade and Wu Xidu (), the deputy chief- of-staff of the 718th Regiment of the communist 359th Brigade were both killed in action as the communists inside the city attempted to breakout. The communists outside the city wall had completely run out any reserve by this time and could not stop the slaughter of their comrades inside the city. At the same time, the communist 2nd Column learned that the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade had left Banqiao and approached Heshui fast, and thus was forced to abandon its effort to take the town. The 12th Regiment of the communist Independent 4th Brigade held the position at Southern Temple Yuan (Nan Si Yuan, ) to the south of Heshui while the 718th Regiment of the 359th Brigade held the position at Elang Mountain (E Lang Shan, ) to cover the communist to the northwest of Heshui. After the complete withdrew, the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade reached the region in the afternoon, and finding no enemy, the 2nd Regiment of the nationalist Reorganized 100th Brigade took over the defense of the city while the nationalist Reorganized 8th Cavalry Brigade withdrew to Western Peak region to regroup and re-supply. Ma Zhongfu (), a nationalist officer who was the youngest brother of Ma Zhongying was named as the mayor and the commander-in-chief of the urban defense. The campaign concluded with nationalist victory. Outcome On May 31, 1947, as Peng Dehuai learned the news of the defeat of the communist 2nd Column, he immediately changed his target of his next battle by telegraphing Mao Zedong on the same day with the local communist party boss Xi Zhongxun, claiming that: > The 82nd Division of the Ma clique in Qinghai was very tough and our force > had concentrated in preparation for first annihilating the 81st Division of > Ma clique in Ningxia, and then to strike the 82nd Division. Half a month later, the communist scored a victory in Huan (ÁéØ) county against the nationalist 81st Division of Ma clique in Ningxia, but it was not until the Xifu Campaign in 1948 did Peng Dehuai was able to fulfill his wish of engaging the nationalist 82nd Division of the Ma clique in Qinghai, but once again, the communist was defeated. Also on May 31, 1947, the political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao () wrote in his diary admitting that the defeat with extreme heavy casualties, which caused the delay of the Eastern Gansu Campaign planned by the communists. On June 1, 1947, Wang Zhen telegraphed Peng Dehuai and Xi Zhongxun to report that the campaign was lost and Wang Zhen himself was responsible, claiming that the forces of Ma clique in Qinghai was very capable, and they acted swiftly and bravely in battles, and this was not an exaggeration to make any excuses. The communist 359th Brigade along suffered over 800 fatalities and had exhausted most of the ammunition, and thus had to retreat to a different region for several days to regroup and re-supply. On June 1, 1947, the political commissar of the communist 2nd Column, Wang Enmao wrote in his diary that the 22nd Regiment of the 8th Cavalry Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 82nd Division was ill-equipped in comparison to other nationalist units and lacked heavy weaponry. However, these nationalist troops were extremely tough and very combat capable. Once their unit was defeated, they could still fight on individually and launch counterattacks, and refused to lay down their arms. Unlike other nationalist units which often ignored the plea of their comrades- in-arms for reinforcement, the forces of the Ma clique in Qinghai not only would reinforce their comrades-in-arms for sure, but they would reinforce their comrades-in-arms multiple times. The communists had gravely underestimated their nationalist opponents in this campaign. The political commissar in his diary concluded that under no circumstance should the enemy be underestimated. The second realization was that the main enemy's position must be taken for the battle to conclude, otherwise, the defenders could launch counterattacks and driven the attackers from the city. The third point was there must be reserves. The fourth was the effectiveness of the artillery bombardment, but one could not solely depend on artillery bombardment, and the fifth point was the need to be always prepared for the enemy's counterattacks. Peng Dehuai instructed the communist 2nd Column to rest of ten days and to use the time to find the mistakes that caused the defeat. Wang Zhen admitted that since he had joined the communist revolution, he fought several hundred battles and there were both victories and defeats, but none of them as bad as in this campaign. Peng Dehuai concluded in late October, 1947 on a conference included commanders of battalion level and above that the main reason of the communist defeat was underestimating the enemy, claiming that branching out in three fronts to attack Ma clique in both Qinghai and Ningxia was a blunder. In his work titled \\"Combat Evaluations in Shaanxi for the Past Nine Months\\", Peng Dehuai further admitted that launching another new campaign just thirteen days after the end of Panlong Campaign was also a blunder in that the communists troops were exhausted and had not had the time needed to rest and regroup. In contrast, the nationalists celebrated the victory in grand scale. After learning the news of the successful beating back the enemy's attack, Ma Bufang ordered the Guo Xueli (), the provincial interior minister to organize a large delegation that included the members of Qinghai provincial dance studio to visit the troops participated in the campaign. The delegation visited cities and towns included Western Peak, Qingyang, and Heshui to hold numerous celebrations, and the nationalist central government also issued medals and other rewards to the nationalist troops excelled in the campaign. Ma Jiyuan, the nationalist commander in this campaign also made special trips to Lanzhou and Xining to report on the campaign to Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, and the experience gained in this campaign would help the nationalists to defeat their communist enemy once again in Xifu Campaign in 1948.

She was the first woman to hold this position.  Early life and education  Anstee grew up in Chelmsford, Essex, in rural England. Neither of her parents had finished secondary school, and they encouraged her to complete her education. She was educated at Chelmsford County High School for Girls and Newnham College, Cambridge. She graduated with first class honours in French and Spanish in 1944, although it was another three years before the university began admitting women to full degree status. Anstee went on to continue her studies at the University of London.  Career  After working as a university lecturer, Anstee joined the Foreign Office in 1948. However, due to the Foreign Office's marriage bar policy in force at the time, which required women employees to resign when they married, her career ended with her marriage. Anstee accompanied her husband, a fellow British diplomat, to Singapore and Manila, the Philippines. The marriage began to fail while the couple were based in Manila, and so she took a position with the local United Nations office as an administration officer in order to earn the money for a fare back to England. On her return in 1952, she took a new position with the United Nations. Anstee served successively as Resident Representative of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) in eight countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. From 1974 to 1987 she occupied senior positions at the UN's New York City headquarters. She was also given major responsibilities in a number of disaster relief operations (Bangladesh 1973, Mexican earthquake 1985, Chernobyl nuclear disaster 1991‚Äì2, Kuwait burning oil wells 1991‚Äì2) as well as special assignments for the Secretary-General to assist countries in dire economic distress (Bolivia 1982‚Äì92, Peru 1990‚Äì92). In addition, she was involved in the design and implementation of several major reforms of the UN system. She was granted Bolivian citizenship in 1990. Anstee worked on operational programmes of economic and social development in all regions of the world, mostly with the United Nations Development Programme. From 1987‚Äì1992 she served as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna, Head of the Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs and Coordinator of all United Nations narcotic drug-control programs. From 1992 to 1993 she was the Secretary-General's Special Representative to Angola; she was the first woman to head a UN peacekeeping mission. After leaving the UN in July 1993, she served as a Special Adviser to the government of Bolivia on matters relating to development and international finance. In 1994 she wrote a report for UNCTAD on the technical cooperation needs of developing countries in the wake of the completion of the Uruguay Round and led an Inter-American Development Bank mission to Bolivia on socio-economic reform. She wrote and lectured widely on the United Nations, particularly on issues related to development, peacekeeping, and UN reform. From 1996 she advised the Under- Secretary-General of the United Nations Department of Political Affairs, on a pro bono publico basis, on operational aspects of post-conflict peace- building. She also chaired the Advisory Board of the Lessons Learned Unit of the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and for some years actively took part in practical training in peacekeeping techniques for both military and civilian personnel, including simulation exercises, in the UK, Sweden, South America and the United States, South Africa and other African countries. Anstee established the Margaret Anstee Developing World Fund to assist graduate students at Newnham College with their fieldwork. During the last three years of her life Margaret Anstee arranged to have weekly Welsh lessons in her home in Knill in the Welsh Marches.

The viewer sees the images from both microscopes next to one another, as in the inset image. A comparison microscope is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two microscopes connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope. History One of the first prototypes of a comparison microscope was developed in 1913 in Germany. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for forensic ballistics, Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle were able to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. =Col. Calvin H. Goddard= Goddard with comparison microscope Philip O. Gravelle, a chemist, developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired bullets and cartridge cases with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of firearms identification in forensic science. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the barrel, breach block, extractor, or firing pin in the gun. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. \\"As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work.\\" Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.Jurgen Thorwald, The Century of the Detective, New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1964Sir Sydney Smith also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to Scotland and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs. Modern comparison microscope The modern instrument has many optical, mechanical and electronic refinements, including fiber optic illumination, video capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single firearm based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a \\"no conclusion\\" result if insufficient marks are present.John H. Dillon, Jr , Comparison Microscopy: The Origins of Firearms identification, A Practical Application of Forensic Science, Technology and Engineering to Case Linkage in Shooting Incidents Not Previously Related by Investigative personnel, BulletTRAX-3D, MatchPoint Plus and the Firearms Examiner, 2005. Since, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match bullets and cartridge cases to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of forensic science. Visualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope. Forensic ballistics The prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the United States compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope. As with most firearms, the fired ammunition components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as \\"ballistics\\". Historically, and currently, this forensic discipline ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired bullets or cartridge cases, one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope. The interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called rifling) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called \\"lands\\" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the barrel surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a \\"signature\\" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this \\"signature\\" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings. When a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a crime scene, forensic examiners compare the ballistic fingerprint of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation. Notable cases =Sacco and Vanzetti case= Forensic innovator Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and extractor marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927. Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions. In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings. =St. Valentine's Day massacre= Colonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in which seven gangsters were killed by rival Al Capone mobsters dressed as Chicago police officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at Northwestern University and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, ballistics, fingerprinting, blood analysis and trace evidence were all brought under one roof. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.

It was released in 1967 and is the first track on the album of the same name. According to a review at AllMusic by Tom Maginnis, the song seems to find lead singer Jim Morrison \\"pondering the state of the then emerging hippie youth culture and how they are perceived by mainstream or 'straight' society\\". A visit to New York City by The Doors inspired Jim Morrison to write \\"Strange Days\\" and other songs on Strange Days, the band's second studio album. As with many other of their songs, it was written far before it was recorded; a live version recorded in May 1966 can be found on the album London Fog 1966. In the Doors biography No One Here Gets Out Alive, \\"Strange Days\\" is described as \\"one of the earliest examples of the Moog synthesizer in rock\\". The synth was hooked up with the help of Paul Beaver and played by vocalist Morrison. Two music videos were made for the song. The first featured footage of the band backstage and onstage, as well as Jim Morrison driving his car into a hole in sand and jumping on the hood in frustration. The second features the same circus performers on the Strange Days cover photo, who would explore New York City. It also included footage of various people, which was made \\"swervy\\" and distorted to fit in with the strange theme of the song. All of this new footage was mixed with footage of the old video, and re-released as a re-mixed video. In 2012, the three surviving members of The Doors‚ÄîRay Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore‚Äîassembled in Los Angeles, California's Village Recorders recording studio with rapper Tech N9ne and producer Fredwreck to record a reworked version of the song. The rapper had intentions on building off of \\"People Are Strange\\", but Krieger suggested using \\"Strange Days\\" instead, as it had \\"more of a driving beat\\". The song, titled \\"Strange 2013\\" and includes vocals of Doors front man Jim Morrison, appears on the rapper's 2013 album Something Else. While speaking on the collaboration, the rapper noted how the band has inspired him over the years, explaining that \\"People Are Strange\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" were what he drew on when naming his record label Strange Music.

Benson and Martin Crossley Evans, I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School (James & James, London, 2002) and Trinity & All Saints College. Career Jarrold directed Great Expectations, starring Ioan Gruffudd, in 1999. The Boston Globe felt that Jarrold helped distinguish it from the many other adaptations by \\"keeping the reins in on his characters, emotionally and morally. They are unromanticized and low-key performances that only rarely spill over into the maudlin and righteous.\\" In 2006, Jarrold directed Kinky Boots. The Chicago Tribune called the film \\"quite enjoyable, effortlessly well-done on every level, even moving at times, but relatively lightweight.\\" In 2007, Becoming Jane was released. The Washington Times stated that Jarrold's direction \\"has made a witty, beautiful film. His technical achievement is no small matter, with nice, long tracking shots and clever focus tricks.\\" The following year, Jarrold directed the first film adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's iconic story Brideshead Revisited, \\"one of the great English novels which has never been filmed,\\" according to producer Kevin Loader. It starred Hayley Atwell, Matthew Goode, Emma Thompson, and Michael Gambon. About the novel's status as an unchangeable classic, Jarrold stated that \\"there are people who are obsessive and obviously that's going to be daunting when they come and judge us. I've had a few people who have said, 'Why are you doing it?' But I think there is a generation who know nothing about Brideshead Revisited, who haven't read the book or who are only dimly aware of the TV series because it's been repeated on ITV4 or something.\\" The Daily Telegraph felt that Jarrold's \\"scenes are filled with grand period detail ‚Äì huge Rolls-Royces, ice sculptures, vast fireplaces of sculptured marble ‚Äì but he stops it from becoming an overblown, glossy spectacle by making the world around the characters feel like a dream.\\" Jarrold directed the HBO film The Girl in 2013. The director received his first Emmy nomination for his work in the film. Mandalay Vision has hired Jarrold to direct the serial killer film Exit 147, with a script written by Travis Milloy. Producer Cathy Schulman and Matthew Rhodes are producing the film for Mandalay. In February 2013, Taylor Kitsch joined the film to play lead as a sadistic sheriff. Most recently Jarrold directed A Royal Night Out for Ecosse Films currently in post-production and due for release in May 2015.Girls' Night Out In 2016, Jarrold became a judge at the Norwich Film Festival, while in 2017, he became a patron of the festival.

Kyiv Harbour entrance and Podilskyi Metro Bridge (under construction) are seen on the foreground. Depiction of Rybalskyi island (peninsula) and Kyiv City Harbour in reference to Dnieper Rybalskyi Island (, translit. ; literally: Fisherman's island) is a misnomer for an actual peninsula on the Dnieper River, located in the right-bank Podil neighborhood and Kyiv Harbour of the city of Kyiv. Although named as an island it is in fact a peninsula and a former spit serving as a left-bank of a former Pochaina River that with time transformed into several oxbow lakes located in Obolon (see Opechen lakes). The peninsula is now a predominantly industrial area. History The peninsula was formed from clay deposits, which served as the left-bank of the Pochaina River. Rybalskyi Peninsula takes its name from the fishermen of Podil who once lived on it. In 1897-1899, the peninsula was raised and strengthened, which would later enable it to house a local shipyard for steamboats (engineered by M.Maksymovych), as well as to form the newly built Kyiv Harbour between the peninsula and the Podil riverbank. In 1926-1930, an electrical power station was constructed in the north-western part of the peninsula (engineered by B. Domanskyi and M. Parusnikov), today Thermal power station-2 (power and heat producing station). During this time an industrial area has developed here. On the banks of the harbor in the Sailors Park a ship-monument to Monitor Zhelezniakov was installed on a pedestal. In 1929 Petrovsky Railway Bridge was finally officially opened after 10 year of abandonment. In the end of the 1930s, the Kuznya na Rybalskomu shipbuilding factory was reconstructed (now it owned by President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko. During the Second World War, the peninsula suffered heavy damage from bombings. After the war, reconstruction began, while new factories and foundations were constructed. The Petrovsky Railway Bridge, shipyard, power station, and others were rebuilt. Present infrastructure Evening view of Rybalskyi Peninsula from Trukhaniv Island In 1961, piers of the new Kyiv River Port was built in the Harbour, and in 1963 the Kyiv cable-stayed bridge was constructed to provide road access to the Rybalskyi Peninsula from the center of the city. In 2001 the bridge was closed to a vehicle traffic, because of its conditions. In 2009 it was closed completely and eventually was partially disassembled with construction of the new Kyiv Harbor Bridge. The main compound of the GUR MOU, the military intelligence institution, is located on the Rybalskyi Peninsula. Development plans In 2005, plans were released for the perspective reconstruction of the Rybalskyi Peninsula, by the year 2020. Included into the plan are residential and business buildings, underground parking, hotel-office combination buildings, trade centers, and socio-cultural constructions. In addition, the Kyiv Metro station, Sudnobudyvina of the Podilsko-Vyhurivska Line, is currently being constructed on the peninsula, which will provide better access to the peninsula from the city.

The story has been adapted into two original video animations (OVAs) released by Toei Video, a subsidiary of the Toei Company. Because of the sexual content the series was one of the manga placed on \\"Harmful manga\\" lists by local and national governmental agencies. The negative publicity resulted in Kodansha discontinuing the series. Plot The story focuses on Yusuke Yamamoto, the teenage son of two gynaecologists. As a boy, he was almost castrated by his two childhood friends, the twin sisters Yuka and Rika Nakamura, his neighbours, which is why he is afraid of women. Also as a child, he saved the twins from an attacking dog. They grow up with a dream that turns Yusuke's life upside down. At the beginning of the story, they re-appear at the home of Yusuke. His father invites the young women in, to live with them, hoping they will heal his son's gynophobia. The therapeutic benefits of this intended treatment are not entirely clear from the series of, sexually tinted, events that unfold. Manga The manga was serialized in Monthly Sh≈çnen Magazine, published by Kodansha, from 1988 to 1990 but discontinued after it met opposition due to the depiction of nudity and sexually tinted content. The manga was re-released by Sh≈çbunkan in 1994 to 1995.

Episode list  Reception In a preview for the, February 23, 1990, release of the OVA, the reviewer for the January 1990 issue of Animage magazine notes that 24 year old Kamimura's popular manga is a little naughty but that the female creator has also attracted a loyal fan base among women despite its erotic content. Writing a review for Asian Trash Cinema, Jim McLennan observed about the first part of the video adaptation: \\"The delight of this episode is its sheer, unrelenting, cheerful tackiness. Yes the girls are utter airheads but charges of sexism must be partly countered by the fact that the original manga was created by a woman, Junko Uemura. In addition, Yusuke is just as socially inadequate in his way, which is doubly amusing given that he is a parody of the likely intended target audience.\\" References External links * * Category:1988 manga Category:1990 anime OVAs Category:Female harem anime and manga Category:J.C.Staff Category:Kodansha franchises Category:Kodansha manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga ","title":"1+2=Paradise"},{"id":"10485461","text":"The Joseph Tavaglione Riverside Downtown Station is a train station in Riverside, California, United States that opened in 1993.

The most developed scenes across the federation existed in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, the Adriatic coast of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, the Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina and Belgrade, the capital of both Yugoslavia and the Socialist Republic of Serbia. Some notable acts included: Pankrti, Paraf, Pekin≈°ka patka, KUD Idijoti, Niet, Patareni and KBO!. History Although a communist country, the non-aligned SFR Yugoslavia was not part of the Eastern Bloc and it was open to western influences. The Yugoslav rock scene was well developed and covered in the media. The punk scene emerged in the late 1970s, influenced by the first wave of punk rock bands from the United Kingdom and the United States, such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash and the Ramones. The DIY punkzine scene also began to develop. The Yugoslav punk rock bands were the first ones formed in a communist country. Punk rock spread across Yugoslavia in northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction, finding its earliest supporters in: Ljubljana, Rijeka, Zagreb, Novi Sad and other cities. The first punk rock bands in the country were Pankrti from Ljubljana and Paraf from Rijeka, both formed around 1977.geopoetika.com Other notable acts were: Buldogi, Berlinski Zid, Grupa 92, Problemi, Termiti and others. Among this generation of bands was the early Prljavo kazali≈°te, but they became a mainstream rock act later. These artists were featured on the compilation album \\"Novi Punk Val 78-80\\", compiled by Igor Vidmar. Meanwhile, in Novi Sad, the notable band Pekin≈°ka patka emerged. The late-1970s and early 1980s bands from Belgrade included: Defektno Efektni, Urbana Gerila and Radniƒçka Kontrola. Notable members of these bands were: Cane, who later came to prominence as a vocalist of Partibrejkers; Srƒëan Todoroviƒá, later a movie actor; and Vladimir Arsenijeviƒá, later a notable punk writer. This generation of bands was included on the Artistiƒçka Radna Akcija compilation. Elektriƒçni orgazam was also a punk rock band during its early period, but it became a mainstream rock act later. During this period, the punkabilly artist Toni Montano emerged, first as a vocalist of the band Radost Evrope, but later became a solo artist. Also, the punk writer Ivan Gli≈°iƒá from ≈†abac emerged in this period. The first punk band in Skopje, is considered to be Fol jazik, formed in 1978. Other notable acts from Skopje included Badmingtons and Saraceni, both led by Vladimir Petrovski Karter. The bass player of Saraceni, Goran Trajkoski, previously played in the punk band Afektiven naboj from Struga. Later he went into post punk and gothic rock and became a vocalist for the band Padot na Vizantija, and later rose to international prominence as a vocalist of Anastasia and Mizar. In Sarajevo, the following acts emerged: Ozbiljno pitanje (which later evolved into the mainstream act Crvena Jabuka), ≈†eva (later Bombaj ≈†tampa led by the internationally acclaimed actor Branko ƒêuriƒá), and the cult band Zabranjeno pu≈°enje. These bands formed the punk-inspired New Primitives movement. In the late 1970s, some punk bands were affiliated with the Yugoslav new wave scene, and were labeled as both punk rock and new wave. During a certain period, the term new wave music was interchangeable with punk. One of the most important compilations of the Yugoslav new wave era is Paket Aran≈æman. The 1980s saw the emergence of streetpunk and Oi!, followed later by: hardcore punk and other subgenres. Notable hardcore punk acts during the 1980s included: Niet, U.B.R., ƒÜao piƒçke, Odpadki civilizacije, To≈æibabe, III Kategorija, Stres DA, Epidemija and Quod Massacre (all from Ljubljana); S.O.R. (from Idrija); C.Z.D. (Maribor); Blitzkrieg, Z.R.M., Patareni and Sk√∂l (Zagreb); KUD Idijoti, Gola jaja, Besposliƒçari and Pasmaters (all from Pula); Rukopotezno povlaƒçilo (Slavonska Po≈æega); The Dissidents (Prijedor) and ≈Ωenevski Dekret (Mostar); Solunski front, Distress, Necrophilia, Crist and Mrgudi (all from Belgrade); KBO! (Kragujevac); Nade iz Inkubatora, Giuseppe Carabino, Marselyeza and Process (all from Subotica); Incest (Novi Beƒçej); Napred U Pro≈°lost (Banatsko Novo Selo); and the Oi! or streetpunk bands Dva minuta mr≈ænje and Vrisak generacije (both from Novi Sad). A notable pop punk band during the 1980s was Psihomodo pop from Zagreb, which was very much influenced by the Ramones. Many foreign punk bands played concerts in former Yugoslavia in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s: The Ruts, Siouxsie and the Banshees, UK Subs, Angelic Upstarts, The Exploited, Charged GBH, The Anti-Nowhere League, Discharge, Youth Brigade and Amebix. In 1983 The Anti-Nowhere League released their album Live in Yugoslavia, while Angelic Upstarts released a live album of the same title in 1985. =Punk ideology= Although the Yugoslav punk musicians were working in a one-party state, they were allowed to include social commentary in their songs, with occasional cases of censorship. Anarcho-punk and Straight Edge scenes also existed, while some bands were purely nihilistic. The Yugoslav punk lyrics often included social and political criticism, anti-war, anti-chauvinist, anti-fascist, anti-authoritarian and anarchist messages, which was reflected in the bands' names, such as: Vrisak Hiro≈°ime (meaning: The Cry of Hiroshima), Apatridi (Stateless persons), The Dissidents (Dissidents), Patareni (Patarenes), Marselyeza (La Marseillaise), Stres Dr≈æavnega Aparata (Stress Of The State Apparatus), Sistem Organizirane Represije (System Of Organized Repression), etc. But there were also many apolitical acts, whose songs dealt with personal subjects, humour, substance abuse, sex, or just innocent youth rebellion. A significant scandal emerged in communist Yugoslavia when the authorities arrested a nazi punk and nazi skinhead group called The Fourth Reich in Ljubljana, in 1981. Though largely obscure, the band was put on trial and its members were imprisoned before having a chance to release any recordings or play live, hence leaving no legacy. They were also once turned down by the notable promoter and Pankrti's manager Igor Vidmar, who refused to sign them as he disapproved of their lyrics.mladina.si Although punk rock was tolerated in Yugoslavia, the system still viewed it with suspicion. The authorities used this scandal as an opportunity to label the movement as subversive and to indiscriminately persecute all punks and skinheads, although the majority of them was actually anti-fascist. Ironically, both Pankrti and KUD Idijoti have their respective cover versions of the Italian antifascist and communist song Bandiera Rossa. The scandal led to moral panic. The authorities' reaction to punks, labeling them as \\"neonazis\\", reached its crescendo during the prosecution of Igor Vidmar, who was arrested for wearing the Dead Kennedys' Nazi Punks Fuck Off! badge with a swastika crossed out.hartford.com That anti-fascist badge was misinterpreted as a \\"nazi provocation\\" and Vidmar was detained. After the scandal faded, the Yugoslav punk scene continued to exist, albeit with less mainstream media coverage. While the first generation of bands such as: Pankrti, Paraf, Prljavo kazali≈°te and Pekin≈°ka patka were well exposed in the media, having appearances on the public TV stations and record contracts for major labels such as: Jugoton, Suzy Records and ZKP RTL, the bands that came afterwards, faced problems and gained prominence only in the underground circles. Also, some media considered punk rock outdated, so they turned their attention to other genres, leaving much of the new punk generation underestimated or unnoticed. This opinion was shared by some musicians, so for example, Paraf and Pekin≈°ka patka went post-punk, while Prljavo kazali≈°te and Elektriƒçni orgazam became conventional rock bands. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw transition to parliamentary democracy, which brought liberalisation to the country, but also a rise in extreme nationalism, previously kept under control by the communist regime. These processes led to the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia. Despite the problems that Igor Vidmar once had with the Yugoslav communist system, in an interview published in the post-communist and post- Yugoslav period, he was quoted saying: \\"It is an irony that it is harder to work now in this liberal democracy, than in the last 10 years of SFRY's communism\\".Glas javnosti.rs = The breakup of Yugoslavia = With the violent breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, its punk rock scene ceased to exist. Its former adherents took different positions on the issue. Some musicians participated in anti-war, anti-nationalist, and anti-fascist activities and were attacked by the nationalists in the independent countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia. Some musicians were forcibly mobilized and sent to the war, but others embraced nationalistic views (in their opinion, patriotic views) and voluntarily joined the armed forces and even saw active combat. In 1992, the supergroup Rimtutituki featuring members of Partibrejkers, Elektriƒçni orgazam and Ekatarina Velika released a pacifist single, but since the authorities didn't allow them to promote it with a gig, they performed on a truck trailer driven through the streets of Belgrade, as their stage. The Serbian musician Branislav Babiƒá Kebra of Urbana Gerila and Obojeni program was mobilized in the army and sent to the war in Croatia, but he deserted with the help of his Croatian friend, Goran Bare of Majke.bim.ba A 1993 compilation of anti-war punk songs, Preko zidova nacionalizma i rata (Over the walls of nationalism and war), included bands from the ex-Yugoslav countries. After the Ten Day War and the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army from Slovenia, its former barracks were squatted and the Metelkova City Autonomous Cultural Center was established. Metelkova was attacked by nazi-skinheads because it hosted punk rockers, anarchists, anti-racist, ecological and lesbian and gay rights activists. In Croatia, some musicians joined the Croatian forces. A notable example was Ivica ƒåuljak, better known as Satan Panonski, a punk singer, punk poet and body artist from Vinkovci. Before the war, he was a convict charged with homicide (in self defence) and he spent several years in mental institutions. He was an outspoken opponent of nationalism and was openly gay, but after the war began, he decided to join the Croatian forces. He was killed on January 27, 1992.Glas Slavonije Darko Jerkoviƒá: Podrumski pakao u sjeni vjetrova rata!, Feb 12, 2016, accessed Oct 26, 2018 (in Croatian) Before the war, he was a close friend of Ivan Gli≈°iƒá, a punk writer from Serbia. Some musicians also performed live on the frontlines or recorded songs, such as \\"Hrvatska mora pobijediti\\" (\\"Croatia Must Win\\") by Psihomodo pop, which boosted the morale of poorly-armed Croatian forces. During this period, especially skinheads and football hooligans expressed nationalistic views. The local punk scenes in the independent countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia continued to exist, some of them heavily suffering during the war. The underground music scene continued, even in the shelters during the Sarajevo siege, and a compilation album, Rock under siege (Radio Zid Sarajevo, Stichting Popmuziek Nederland), was released in 1995. After Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina proclaimed independence, and SFR Yugoslavia was dissolved, a new federal state comprising only Serbia and Montenegro, named \\"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\\", was established. The punk rock bands in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia included: Atheist rap, Ritam Nereda and Zbogom Brus Li from Novi Sad; Direktori and ≈†aht from Belgrade; and Goblini from ≈†abac. =2000s and later= After the end of the war and the departure of nationalist leaders such as Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Franjo Tuƒëman, the former Yugoslav nations began to normalise their relations. Their music scenes could now restore their former cooperation. Anti-Nowhere League came once again to former Yugoslav soil (in Croatia) and released their live album, Return to Yugoslavia. In 2003 Igor Mirkoviƒá from Croatia made the rockumentary Sretno dijete (Happy Child), named after a song by Prljavo kazali≈°te. The movie covers the early Yugoslav Punk and new wave scene featuring artists from Zagreb, Ljubljana, and Belgrade. Inspired by \\"Sretno dijete\\", the rockumentary \\"Bilo jednom...\\" was made in 2006, featuring punk-rockers from Novi Sad who were active during the first half of the 1990s. Current notable acts in the former Yugoslav countries include: Niet, Scuffy Dogs, Aktivna Propaganda, GUB, Pero Lov≈°in (formerly of Pankrti), Golliwog, In-Sane, Kreshesh Nepitash, No Limits, all from Slovenia; Hladno pivo, Pasi, KUD Idijoti, Let 3 (featuring the former Termiti member Damir Martinoviƒá Mrle), Kawasaki 3P, Fat Prezident, Deafness By Noise, Overflow, FOB, No More Idols, Hren, Lobotomija, Brkovi, Grupa tvog ≈æivota, FNC Diverzant, Tito's Bojs and Gu≈æva u 16ercu from Croatia; Superhiks, Two Sides, Noviot Pochetok, and Denny Te Chuva from the Republic of Macedonia; Red Union, Zbogom Brus Li, Atheist Rap, Six Pack, Vox Populi, SMF, BOL, Ritam Nereda, ≈†aht, Miki Pirs, Birtija, Priliƒçno Prazni, KBO!, Potres, Gavrilo Princip, Zvoncekova Bilje≈ænica, Mitesers, Pogon BGD, Hitman, Nor, Concrete Worms, Ringi≈°pil, The Bayonets, The Bomber from Serbia, and others. Reunions Pankrti played a reunion concert in Tivoli Hall in Ljubljana, Slovenia, on December 1, 2007, as a celebration of their 30th anniversary. They also toured across parts of former Yugoslavia with a new guitarist, Ivan Kral, who previously played with Patti Smith, Blondie, and Iggy Pop.vojvodina.com Meanwhile, in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia, the group Badmingtons reformed, and their music was included in the soundtrack for the feature film Prevrteno (Upside Down), directed by Igor Ivanov Izy. At the Exit festival in Novi Sad on July 13, 2008, Pekin≈°ka Patka played a reunion concert, sharing the stage with the Sex Pistols, who played afterwards that evening.

She is known as the \\"nightingale of Nepal\\", having recorded over 4,000 songs during her lifetime. Much of her music revolved around the themes of patriotism and love. Nepali Singer Tara Devi Dies at 60 OhMyNews ‚Äì 23 January 2006  Early life  She was born in 1945, in the neighborhood of Indra Chok in Kathmandu, Nepal. She began singing at the age of seven. \\"Sanguri Wari nihou tyo dhara pani\\" is one of her popular songs. Tara Devi was born on 1945 in Kathmandu, to Krishna Bahadur and Radha Devi. Tara Devi started singing at age seven and went on to record 4000 songs in her singing career of 40 years. When she was 5 years old, she went to Radio Nepal and got the opportunity to sing. Her singing was so soulful that everyone in the crowd got extremely impressed. She was primarily involved in singing for children's programs at Radio Nepal. She was able to pursue her musical career along with her studies. She completed her Bachelors in Music. During the starting of her career, She would earn Rs. 5 per song at Radio Nepal, which eventually rose to Rs. 100 ( USD 1 as of now ).

Tara Devi is famously termed as the \\"Nightingale of Nepal\\". Tara Devi has recorded songs of wide range of genres, from prayer songs to Nepali folk songs, most of which are regarded as classic numbers in Nepal.

The 2007 A.S. Roma-Manchester United conflict occurred on 4 April 2007 at the Stadio Olimpico during the 2006‚Äì07 UEFA Champions League quarter-final match between Roma and Manchester United. In the conflict, missiles were thrown over a perspex barrier separating the two sets of supporters, which prompted the Italian riot police to enter and attempt to subdue the hostile crowd. The incident has been controversial, as the police and team supporters on both sides view the causes of and reactions to the melee differently. Incidents in Rome Before the match began, riot police positioned themselves only on the Manchester United side of the perspex barrier between the fans. After Roma scored their first goal, their fans were allegedly throwing missiles over the barrier into the Manchester United fans. After this, reports claim that a section of Manchester United fans pushed around the Stadio Olimpico ground stewards; as a result of this the riot police moved in to gain control of the United crowd. The following police action has resulted in Manchester United accusing the Italian police of \\"hand[ing] out indiscriminate beatings to United supporters\\" and encouraged witnesses to contact them. Many Manchester United supporters and the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association have also claimed the police response was disproportionate and indiscriminate, and that they had targeted the Manchester United supporters. Eleven Manchester United supporters and two Roma supporters were taken to hospital following the violence. UEFA have launched an investigation and Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker has said that answers were needed into whether or not Italian police had been brutal. Amnesty International has also backed calls for an inquiry. Achille Serra, head of Rome Police, said the police action was a 'justified response', and said there would be no inquiry unless there were evidence of any alleged police brutality. Italian Football Federation President Giancarlo Abete has also defended the policemen on duty at the ground. Psychologist Clifford Stott attended the match and was critical of the Italian police, adding \\"One way of looking at it is that the Italian fans use violence against English fans to provoke the police to have a go at them.\\" Footage filmed by United supporters was used as evidence of unfair treatment, including a recording of one female fan being attacked without provocation.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--bs4OEiIg Footage of a female fan having camera snatched and being hit This film later resulted in an apology to the fan involved from Roma players. Before the match, Manchester United issued warnings to its supporters that they could be attacked, highlighting areas that should be avoided in the city, where hardcore Roma fans, known as ultras, may congregate. This warning was viewed as derogative by some in Rome, including Rome's mayor, Walter Veltroni, who said it was \\"dangerous because it risks creating a negative climate\\". Five people (three English and two Italians) were also injured as they made their way to the stadium. The Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said that the police inside the ground were excessive in their use of batons on some of the United fans, but has called for people not to judge the entire Italian police force by the actions of those involved in this incident. The Independent Manchester United Supporters Association (IMUSA) has demanded an apology from the Italian police, has said those fans injured should be compensated, and that they were prepared to take legal action to obtain this. Action was initiated in the Italian courts but when this was timed out a civil case was opened. That action is still live and still awaiting a decision. The fans of both Manchester United and Milan were praised by the Manchester police following their Champions League semi-final match on 24 April 2007. On 25 April 2007, UEFA released a statement regarding the sentence for both teams. Roma were fined CHF75,000 (‚Ç¨47,700/¬£31,100) while Manchester United were fined CHF35,500 (‚Ç¨21,300/¬£14,500). Both teams have three days from the date of receipt of the written grounds for the decision.  Incidents in Manchester In the return leg, which was played at Manchester United's Old Trafford; police beat Roma fans with batons and brought out police horses and dogs after Roma and United fans had thrown bottles at each other outside of the ground before the game. There were 14 English fans arrested along with seven Italians. British Sports Minister Richard Caborn was quoted as saying \\"It's unfortunate that there have been some scuffles outside Old Trafford. This was always going to be a highly- charged game following the incident last week. Greater Manchester Police have used proportionate force in a potentially difficult situation and have handled it well.\\" Reports from police spokespersons said that they were \\"required to deal with a number of small and isolated incidents\\" and that the trouble was \\"contained within five minutes\\". Post-conflict events In the season following the conflicts, Roma were once again set to play Manchester United. Roma club captain Francesco Totti sought to defuse any potential tensions by making a personal video apology to a female United fan, Carly Lyes, who was caught up in the clash between police and United fans. Totti's message was well received by Lyes, but the fan pointed out that it was the police, Roma officials, and UEFA who should be apologising for the events of that night, not the playing staff. Related incidents In the previous round of the competition, Manchester United fans were involved in an incident at the Stade F√©lix-Bollaert in Lens in February, during a round of 16 match between Lille OSC and Manchester United. As the stadium began to fill, too many United fans were directed to the away stand which couldn't facilitate them, causing the spectators at the front of the stand to be pressed against the parameter fencing. Amidst fears of a Hillsborough-like incident, fans attempted to climb over the metal fencing surrounding the away section. Riot police saw the attempts as a pitch invasion and fired tear gas into the crowd, which prompted criticism of their handling of the situation. In 2006, three Middlesbrough fans were stabbed and 10 others injured during fights with Roma fans in a UEFA Cup quarter-final match.

In broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS), frequency-domain photon migration (FDPM) and time-independent near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy are combined to measure absorption and scattering in thick tissue. Observations of the optical properties of absorption and scattering from FDPM are then analyzed and used to display images of hemoglobin, oxygen, blood volume, water and fat content, and cellular structure of the tissues examined. Tromberg has developed broadband diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI), used to measure the magnitude of light scattering and absorption in thick tissues, and is using this method for in vivo functional imaging to detect and monitor cancer. For DOSI, near-infrared light shines onto tissue and the amount of light that is reflected back is measured. The technique can be used to create images of tissue as deep as several centimeters below the skin's surface, detecting signs of metabolic activity such as blood flow, oxygenation, fat content, water content, and fluid build-up. Changes can be viewed in real time, instantaneously, without disturbing the tissue. This allows researchers to better understand and monitor changes in tissue growth and in response to treatment. SFDI is similar, using near infrared light to detect and measure oxygen saturation, water, and fat content. The information is used to describe tissue at multiple depths, to map an entire area such as a tumor, and to monitor changes. In multiphoton microscopy, Tromberg has developed a noninvasive technique combining two photon excited fluorescence microscopy (TPEF) and second-harmonic generation (SHG), taking measurements at different wavelengths and creating a three-dimensional representation of unstained in vivo thick tissue.

History The Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B&M;) reached Ottumwa from Burlington, Iowa in 1859, and the city remained the western terminus for the line until after the American Civil War. In the summer of 1865 work began to extend the line west of Ottumwa and it reached the Missouri River four years later. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) invested heavily in the project and took over the B&M; in 1875. The CB&Q; built a combination passenger and freight depot in Ottumwa in 1889. Its design was attributed to the Chicago architectural firm of Burnham and Root, who designed all of the railroad's larger depots. Ottumwa was the division point for the line. The CB&Q; was one of five railroads that served the city, and it shared their depot with the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. This depot was known as Ottumwa Union Depot. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) and Wabash Railroad served Ottumwa at a depot at Jefferson Street, listed as about away from the current station. The since-abandoned Milwaukee Road tracks were on a branch from its main line to Kansas City, which ran through Ottumwa on the northwest side of town. The Wabash Railroad tracks ended at Ottumwa, and crossed the Des Moines River on a bridge that has been repurposed into a trail. After World War II Ottumwa experienced a building boom, and the CB&Q; decided to replace its depot with a modern one. The Chicago architectural firm of Holabird, Root & Burgee designed the new depot as well new depot in Burlington, Iowa in 1943. That depot was the standard used to design other CB&Q; depots after the war with Ottumwa being one. The new Ottumwa depot was completed in 1951 by Benson Construction Company using the limestone foundation of the old depot and its exterior walls. None of the old depot is visible today. During construction, the railroad used two passenger cars as ticket office and waiting room. Ballingall Park in front of the depot was completed at the same time. The present depot is a two-story structure designed in a simple Modernist style. The rectangular building features a flat roof, broad eaves banded windows, and an exterior clad with ashlar Lannon stone. Local transit connections The Ottumwa Transit Authority East-West Route stops near the station. However, under the current California Zephyr schedule, Emeryville-bound trains arrive almost an hour after the system ends its daily operations.

Among Amtrak stations in Iowa, Osceola is closest to Des Moines, Iowa's capital and most populous city; however, the station is still almost from the center of Des Moines. The Osceola Depot was built in 1907 by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;), one of the major networks operating in the upper Midwest and West during much of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Designed in the Prairie Style, the reddish-brown brick depot has a low slung, horizontal profile reinforced by the limestone water table and belt courses that wrap around the building. Originally a combination depot, the building contained freight and passenger areas under one roof. The ticket office retains many original features, such as ticket windows, wood benches and light fixtures.Great American Stations. Accessed April 7, 2013. It passed to Burlington Northern in 1970 upon the Q's merger with Great Northern and Northern Pacific, and became part of the BNSF Railway in 1995. In 2007, following a decade of talks with BNSF, the city of Osceola gained ownership of the historic building. Working with an architect specializing in historic preservation, the city planned a multi-phase restoration of the depot and parking area to create an intermodal transportation hub to better serve Amtrak and intercity bus riders. The restoration of the exterior was funded in part by $600,000 in federal funds obtained through the Iowa Department of Transportation. This project included the installation of a new roof, reconstruction of a damaged chimney, restoration of existing windows, installation of new historically appropriate storm windows, manufacture of new entry doors that match the originals, re-pointing of the mortar that holds the bricks in place, and general rehabilitation and cleaning of the brick and stone surfaces. City officials also hope to restore the interior if funding can be found. According to the proposal, the former freight area would become the new waiting room and might accommodate local history displays; in turn, the former waiting room would become a small museum, restaurant, or other retail space.

Other names include painted rock lobster, common rock lobster, bamboo lobster, blue lobster, and blue spiny lobster. P. versicolor is one of the three most common varieties of spiny lobster in Sri Lanka, alongside Panulirus homarus and Panulirus ornatus. Etymology The genus name Panulirus derives from the Greek word palin (meaning backwards) and oura (meaning tail and can be translated into which stands with the tail folded under the abdomen. The species name versicolor is a Latin word meaning of different colors. Morphology P. versicolor grows up to long, but is typically no more than . It has no claws, two spiny rostra over the eyes, and two pairs of large antennae, like all spiny lobsters. The first pair of antennae are double ended, the second hard and spiny, both are usually white. The carapace is cylindrical, made of chitin, very solid and not extensible. The coloration is white, pink and black, with horizontal bands and a reticule. The abdomen is green with transverse black and white bands. The legs are dark blue to black with white stripes and the tail is blue-green. The tail is made up of five yellowish appendages yellowish at its base, with an apical blue area and a white margin. Also juveniles have a bright blue coloration with white lines, while the base of the antennas is white instead of pink. This species is rather similar to Panulirus femoristriga and Panulirus longipes. Biology and behaviour In P. versicolor the reproduction usually takes place in summer, but it can happen all year around. Mating occurs belly to belly after a love parade. The spermatophore released by the males adheres to the female's sternum for several weeks. Females carry their eggs, about several hundred thousand, under their abdomen. A long oceanic larval phase follows, with several moults. These spiny lobster are nocturnal and solitary. In the daytime they hide in small caves and crevices in reefs or under coral. They are carnivores, eating both carrion and fresh caught arthropods, other crustaceans, and occasional small fish. Geographic distribution P. versicolor is present in the western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.ITIS The Integrated Taxonomic Information System In the Indian Ocean it occurs from as far south on the east coast of Africa as Natal, up through the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, in the Arabian Sea across to India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia, down through Indonesia to the waters of north-western Australia. In the western and central Pacific, it occurs as far north as southern Japan, throughout Micronesia, Melanesia, Polynesia and in the waters of north-eastern Australia.Page J. 2013. First record of the painted spiny lobster Panulirus versicolor (Latrielle, 1804) in coastal Georgia, USA. BioInvasions Records (REABIC). 2(2):149-152. A single P. versicolor was found in shallow coastal waters of Georgia, United States, in 2012. Likely deliberately released as an adult or unintentionally transported as a larva in a cargo ship's ballast water, it was the first specimen reported in the U.S. and the Atlantic Ocean. Habitat This species occurs in the shallow tropical waters, in coral reef ecosystems and on seaward edges of the reef plateau, at depths up to . Economic uses Panulirus versicolor is very commercially exploited, which has led to its rarefaction or even disappearance in many places; however, as its range is large and includes many protected areas, the species is not considered to be globally threatened. It is used as a food source throughout its range. P. versicolor is also kept in home aquariums.\\"Blue Lobster\\" Pet Solutions Sustainably farmed aquarium products from the Western Province, Solomon Is.\\" World Wildlife Fund Gallery File: Palinuridae - Panulirus versicolor (Painted Spiny Lobster).jpgPanulirus versicolor in Maldives.

Appropriate management of key ecological features delineates the management boundaries of an IEA. The identification and protection of IEAs is an element of an ecosystem-based management approach. Important ecological areas may have varying levels of management of extractive activities, from monitoring up to and including marine reserve. IEAs have management measures tailored to the ecological features within the area with consideration of socioeconomic factors. Whereas marine reserves generally have a fixed management policy of no extraction or ‚Äòno-take‚Äô. Nonetheless, a marine reserve may be the appropriate management policy for an IEA. The identification and management of IEAs is a form of ocean zoning. In the event that there are a series of linked IEAs within a large marine ecosystem, a collective action to manage the network, such as a marine sanctuary or national monument, may be warranted.

Approximately 5,600 former Confederate soldiers enlisted in the \\"United States Volunteers\\", organized into six regiments of infantry between January 1864 and November 1866. Of those, more than 250 had begun their service as Union soldiers, were captured in battle, then enlisted in prison to join a regiment of the Confederate States Army. They surrendered to Union forces in December 1864 and were held by the United States as deserters, but were saved from prosecution by being enlisted in the 5th and 6th U.S. Volunteers. An additional 800 former Confederates served in volunteer regiments raised by the states, forming ten companies. Four of those companies saw combat in the Western Theater against the Confederate Army, two served on the western frontier, and one became an independent company of U.S. Volunteers, serving in Minnesota. The term \\"galvanized\\" has also been applied to former Union soldiers enlisting in the Confederate Army, including the use of \\"galvanized Yankees\\" to designate them. At least 1,600 former Union prisoners of war enlisted in Confederate service in late 1864 and early 1865, most of them recent German or Irish immigrants who had been drafted into Union regiments.Speer (1997), p. 219. The practice of recruiting from prisoners of war began in 1862 at Camp Douglas at Chicago, Illinois, with attempts to enlist Confederate prisoners who expressed reluctance to exchange following their capture at Fort Donelson. Some 228 prisoners of mostly Irish extraction were enlisted by Col. James A. Mulligan before the War Department banned further recruitment March 15.Brown (1963), pp. 55‚Äì56.Among the 228 was journalist Henry Morton Stanley. The ban continued until 1863, except for a few enlistments of foreign-born Confederates into largely ethnic regiments. Three factors led to a resurrection of the concept: an outbreak of the American Indian Wars by tribes in Minnesota and on the Great Plains; the disinclination of paroled but not exchanged Federal troops to be used to fight them; and protests of the Confederate government that any use of paroled troops in Indian warfare was a violation of the Dix‚ÄìHill prisoner of war cartel.Brown (1963), pp. 61‚Äì64.The Lincoln Administration wished to avoid any legal wrangles over the prisoner cartel that might be construed as recognition of the Confederacy as a legitimate government. Gen. Gilman Marston, commandant of the huge prisoner of war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, recommended that Confederate prisoners be enlisted in the U.S. Navy, which Secretary of War Edwin Stanton approved December 21. General Benjamin Butler's jurisdiction included Point Lookout, and he advised Stanton that more prisoners could be recruited for the Army than the Navy. The matter was then referred to President Lincoln, who gave verbal authorization on January 2, 1864, and formal authorization on March 5 to raise the 1st United States Volunteer Infantry for three years' service without restrictions as to use.Brown (1963), pp. 65‚Äì67. In January 1863, following issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation, the United States began to actively recruit black soldiers. The following May, the Confederate Congress passed a joint resolution suspending exchange of black Union soldiers and their white officers, and ordering that they instead be put on trial and punished. On July 30, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln ordered suspension of exchanges of Confederate prisoners until the Confederacy agreed to treat black prisoners the same as white prisoners.National Park Service publication on Andersonville National Historic Site, https://www.nps.gov/ande/learn/historyculture/grant-and-the-prisoner- exchange.htm. On September 1, Lincoln approved 1,750 more Confederate recruits in order to bolster his election chances in Pennsylvania, enough to form two more regiments, to be sent to the frontier to fight American Indians.Brown (1963), pp. 11‚Äì14.Pennsylvania was the home state of Lincoln's opponent General George B. McClellan, and the request was by a Pennsylvania delegation offering to pay the bounties in return for the state receiving the credit against its allocation. Due to doubts about their ultimate loyalty, galvanized Yankees in federal service were generally assigned to garrison forts far from the Civil War battlefields or in action against Indians in the west. However, desertion rates among the units of galvanized Yankees were little different from those of state volunteer units in Federal service.Brown (1963), p. 2.Brown quotes the 1928 study by Ella Lonn Desertion During the Civil War which found that desertion rates among the state regiments was 13 percent, while that of the six U.S.V.I. regiments was 14 percent. The final two regiments of U.S. Volunteers were recruited in the spring of 1865 to replace the 2nd and 3rd U.S.V.I., which had been enlisted as one-year regiments. Galvanized troops of the U.S. Volunteers on the frontier served as far west as Camp Douglas, Utah; as far south as Fort Union, New Mexico; and as far north as Fort Benton, Montana.Three companies of the 6th U.S.V.I. were posted to Camp Douglas; Company H, 5th U.S.V.I. escorted a wagon train to Fort Union; and a detachment of 10 men of Company H, 1st U.S.V.I. under Lt. Cyrus L. Hutchins traveled by steamboat on May 12, 1865, to Fort Benton to control trade between there and another post at the mouth of the Yellowstone River. (Brown 1963, pp. 67, 91, 205). Origin of term The National Park Service describes the origin of the expression \\"Galvanized Yankee\\" in a bulletin published in 1992 for visitors to the Gateway Arch National Park, which was then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial: > The term \\"galvanized\\" is most commonly associated with metal when it is > coated with zinc to protect it from corrosion. In the process the surface > color of the metal is altered, but underneath the coating the steel is > unchanged. During the Civil War, in both Northern and Southern prison camps, > soldiers sometimes decided to \\"galvanize,\\" or change sides, to save > themselves from the horrors of prison life. Like the metal, these galvanized > soldiers in many cases were still \\"Good old Rebels,\\" or \\"Billy Yanks,\\" > underneath their adopted uniforms. The expression \\"galvanized Yankees\\" sprang up as a term of deprecation among Confederate prisoners for those who chose to enlist.Butts (2005), \\"Trading Gray for Blue\\". At the same time, the use of \\"white-washed Rebels\\" as a reference came into being among Federal state regiments stationed on the frontier at the time when the 1st U.S.V.I. arrived. Dee Brown cites documentation from March and April 1865 indicating that the term was first used to characterize captured Federals who turned Confederate. The general use of \\"galvanized Yankees\\" originated in a story in the Springfield Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts) on May 25, 1865, by Samuel Bowles, who wrote: > Among the present limited number of troops on the Plain are two regiments of > infantry, all from the rebel army. They have cheerfully re-enlisted into the > federal service. They are known in the army as \\"white-washed rebs,\\" or as > they call themselves, \\"galvanized Yankees.\\"Brown (1963), p. 9.

Dimon had served as a junior officer in a number of regiments, including the 2nd Louisiana Infantry, composed of former Confederates and Union loyalists. (Brown 1963 pp. 8, 77; Butts). was recruited at Point Lookout prison camp between January 21 and April 22, 1864, as a three-year regiment. Assigned to the District of Eastern Virginia, Department of Virginia and North Carolina, it moved to Norfolk, Virginia, where on orders of General Grant it was relegated to provost duty there, Portsmouth, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. In August 1864, Grant ordered it to the Department of the Northwest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The 1st U.S.V.I. traveled by ship to New York City,The ship was the transport SS Continental, which in 1866 would carry the 100 \\"Mercer Belles\\" as brides to Seattle, Washington. (Brown 1963 p. 71). and by train to Chicago, where it received further orders splitting the regiment. Four companies continued to Milwaukee, while six companies (B, C, D, E, H, and K) were sent to St. Louis, Missouri, arriving there August 22. They moved by the steamboat Effie Deans and by forced march to Fort Rice, Dakota Territory, arriving there October 17 for garrison duty. Conditions were hard over the winter, and fully 11% of the command died of illness, primarily scurvy.Utley (1967), p. 316. Between May 10 and August 31, 1865, Company K garrisoned Fort Berthold and Company B the trading post known as Fort Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone, obliged to travel by steamboat through hostile territory.Brown (1963), pp. 91, 109.The large side-wheeler Yellowstone and small stern-wheeler Big Horn made the respective trips. Four companies were present at Fort Rice, along with two companies of the 4th U.S.V.I., when a large force of Lakota and CheyenneButts places the number at 500, Brown 1,000. led by Sitting Bull attacked for three hours on July 28, 1865, making away with the entire horse herd and killing two soldiers.Brown (1963), pp. 105‚Äì106. In October 1865, the battalion returned to St. Louis to muster out November 27.Brown (1963), pp. 71‚Äì81, 111. The four companies continuing on to Wisconsin in August 1864 were ordered to the District of Minnesota.Companies A, F, G, and I were commanded by Lt.Col. William Tamblyn, and posted respectively at Fort Abercrombie, Fort Wadsworth, Fort Ripley, and Fort Ridgely. Their muster out in July 1865 was canceled and in October, they were ordered to build and garrison Fort Fletcher, Kansas, and man two outposts at Monument Station and Ponds Creek Station, also in Kansas, to protect the new Butterfield Overland Despatch stagecoach route. Companies A, F, G, and I of the 1st U.S.V.I. mustered out at Fort Leavenworth on May 22, 1866, after 25 months of active service, the longest service of any of the \\"galvanized Yankees.\\"Brown (1963), pp. 191‚Äì193, 203‚Äì204. ;2nd U.S. Volunteer Infantry Authorized in October 1864 at the Rock Island prisoner camp in Illinois as a one-year regiment, the 2nd U.S.V.I.Col. Andrew Patrick Caraher commanded the 2nd U.S. Volunteer Infantry. Born in Armagh, Ireland, he commanded the 28th Massachusetts at the Battle of Antietam as a captain. He was captured in 1863 as a lieutenant colonel of the Veteran Volunteer Corps and escaped from Libby Prison, then became assistant commandant at Rock Island. He was commissioned in the regular army after the war and became a captain in the 8th Cavalry. He died in Texas in 1885 of complications of being wounded at Fredericksburg in 1862.(Brown 1963, pp. 8, 45). was not organized until February 1865. It was ordered to the Department of the Missouri and sent by rail to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where it was assigned to duty in the District of Upper Arkansas along the Santa Fe Trail from the Little Arkansas River to Fort Dodge, Kansas, and along the Cimarron Crossing to Fort Lyon, Colorado. From Fort Leavenworth the unit marched to Fort Riley, and stationed companies there and at Salem, Fort Ellsworth, Fort Larned, Fort Zarah and Fort Scott, Kansas. Companies F and G were involved in the establishment of Fort Dodge in the summer of 1865. Their duties involved scouting, wagon train escort and operating against Indians. Members of the regiment were present as guards at the signing of the Little Arkansas Treaty. The regiment mustered out at Fort Leavenworth November 7, 1865.Brown (1963), pp. 45‚Äì53. ;3rd U.S. Volunteer Infantry The 3rd U.S.V.I.Col. Christopher H. McNally, born in England, was commissioned in the U.S. Mounted Rifles (later the 3rd Cavalry) in 1855 after serving seven years as an enlisted man. A captain in the 3rd Cavalry, he was captured on July 27, 1861, near Fort Fillmore, New Mexico, following the First Battle of Mesilla. McNally was paroled on the battlefield, then exchanged in August 1862, rejoining the 3rd Cavalry in April 1863 as Inspector of Horses. (Brown 1963, pp. 8, 21). was authorized at the Rock Island prisoner camp in October 1864 as a one-year regiment but not organized until February 1865. It was ordered to the Department of the Missouri, arriving at Fort Kearny, Nebraska, April 9, 1865,The 3rd U.S.V.I. arrived at Fort Kearny on the date that Robert E. Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House. where it was assigned to duty in the Districts of Nebraska and Colorado. Companies A and B were stationed at Fort Kearney; C and D at Cottonwood, Colorado; E and F at Fort Rankin; and G and H at Julesburg, Colorado, protecting overland mail routes from Indian attacks. Companies I and K were sent to Fort Laramie, and on May 15, 1865, were parceled out in small detachments along 300 miles of the Pacific Telegraph Company line from Laramie to South Pass, Territory of Idaho (now Wyoming). Company I was involved in numerous skirmishes, including combat at the Battle of the Platte Bridge Station, and suffered higher casualties than any other company of the 3rd U.S.V.I.Brown (1963), p. 18. The regiment mustered out November 29, 1865, having served with distinction, including a low desertion rate.Brown (1963), pp. 17‚Äì18, 43‚Äì45. ;4th U.S. Volunteer Infantry The 4th U.S.V.I.Lt. Col. Charles C.G. Thornton, formerly a captain with the 12th Maine in Louisiana, and on the staff of Brig. Gen. George F. Shepley, including a stint as lieutenant colonel of the 2nd U.S.V.I. (Brown 1963, pp. 8, 112). was organized as a three-year regiment at Point Lookout on October 31, 1864, although only six companies could be induced to enlist. The quality of recruit was not as high as that of the earlier 1st U.S.V.I. The regiment waited at Portsmouth, Virginia, in hopes that more troops could be raised, but calls for men from the west led to its transfer to the frontier at the end of April 1865. 10% deserted before the regiment reached Sioux City, Iowa, in Department of the Northwest, on May 28. Many were arrested and held in confinement before returning to the ranks. Two companies were stationed at Fort Rice, then at Fort Sully; one at Fort Berthold; and three at Fort Randall until June 1866, when the six companies were recalled to Leavenworth, mustering out as they arrived between June 18 and July 2.Brown (1963), pp. 112‚Äì117. ;5th U.S. Volunteer Infantry The 5th U.S.V.I.Col. Henry Eveleth Maynadier, 1851 West Point graduate born at Fort Monroe, Virginia, former major of the 12th Infantry, brevetted major general. (Brown 1963, pp. 7‚Äì8, 120). was enlisted at the Alton and Camp Douglas prisoner camps in Illinois in March and April 1865 as a three-year regiment, then ordered to Fort Leavenworth on April 28, 1865, at the urging of Maj. Gen. Grenville Dodge, commanding general of the Department of the Missouri. From there it moved to Fort Riley between May 18 and May 28 to relieve units of the 2nd U.S.V.I. in guarding the Santa Fe Trail.Brown (1963), pp. 120‚Äì122, 206. In August three companies were sent to Fort Halleck, Idaho Territory (now Wyoming); two companies to Camp Wardwell, Colorado; two companies to Fort Lyon, and Company B to Denver for quartermaster duty. Companies saw periodic duty at Fort McPherson, Nebraska; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Fort John Buford, Wyoming.Brown (1963), p. 138. Companies C and D, consisting mostly of former Union soldiers who had been captured after enlisting in the Confederate 10th Tennessee, escorted the Sawyers expedition to build a road to Montana and garrisoned Fort Reno for nearly a year.Brown (1963), pp. 122, 133. Companies A through G reassembled at Fort Kearny in August 1866 and mustered out on October 11. Companies H, I, and K garrisoned Fort Lyon until October 1866, when Gen. William T. Sherman closed the post for deplorable living conditions. They marched to Fort Leavenworth, where they mustered out on November 13, the last of the \\"galvanized Yankees\\".Brown (1963), pp. 142, 210.Company H, 5th U.S.V.I. was the most traveled of the \\"galvanized Yankee\\" units in its 20 months of service on the plains, operating in five districts and at every post in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas; and seeing considerable skirmishing. It was also the only unit to travel to New Mexico. It had one of the highest desertion rates, with only 30 of its original 97 men left to muster out, only two of the losses due to death. (Brown 1963 pp. 205‚Äì206). ;6th U.S. Volunteer Infantry The 6th U.S.V.I.Col. Carroll H. Potter had failed to complete West Point in 1857, was appointed an assistant adjutant general of volunteers with the rank of captain in October 1861. He served on a number of staffs and was promoted to major in February 1865, then brevetted a brigadier general of volunteers for \\"meritorious service\\" in March. After mustering out of the 6th U.S.V.I. he received a regular commission as a 1st lieutenant in the 18th Infantry. (Brown 1963, pp. 8, 142‚Äì143). was recruited from prisoner camps at Camp Chase, Ohio (two companies); Camp Morton, Indiana (two companies); and Camp Douglas, Illinois (six companies), as a three-year regiment, and assembled on April 2, 1865, at Camp Fry near Chicago for outfitting and drill. It traveled by rail to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, on May 10‚Äì11, 1865, the only regiment of \\"galvanized Yankees\\" to arrive on the frontier intact and at full strength, 976 officers and men.Brown (1963), p. 144. Between May 14 and May 31, they marched to Fort Kearny, Nebraska, where it dispersed to replace the various companies of the 3rd U.S.V.I. guarding the telegraph line and the Oregon Trail. In August Gen. Patrick E. Connor ordered regimental headquarters and three companies to garrison Camp Douglas, Utah; and two companies west from Fort Rankin, Colorado, to replace the cavalry along the telegraph line west of Fort Laramie. 35 of the 275 men ordered to Utah deserted before their arrival October 9.Brown (1963), pp. 146‚Äì147. The companies in Utah were relieved by regulars in April 1866 and marched to Fort Bridger. The other seven companies frequently changed stations, posted at some point to Camp Wardwell, Julesburg, and Fort Sedgwick, Colorado; Post Alkali, Fort Cottonwood, Mud Springs, Plum Creek, and Columbus, Nebraska; Fort Wallace, Kansas; and Fort Laramie, Fort Halleck, Fort Caspar, and Sweetwater Station, Territory of Idaho. In October 1866 all companies except Company B at Fort Wallace were relieved by regulars and assembled at Fort Kearny, where they mustered out between October 10 and 15. Company B marched across Kansas to Fort Leavenworth and mustered out on November 3.Brown (1963), pp. 143‚Äì145, 152, 159, 161.Company I of the 6th U.S.V.I. was commanded by the only officer commissioned from the ranks of the \\"galvanized Yankees,\\" John T. Shanks, originally from Texas and a captain of Tennessee cavalry captured with Morgan's raiders.

In September 1863, authorized to expand to a regiment, the 1st Connecticut Cavalry while on Provost Guard at Camp Chesebrough in Baltimore, recruited 82 replacements from among Confederate prisoners kept at Fort Delaware, placing most in Company G (organized October 5, 1863) and spreading the rest throughout the regiment. In the spring of 1864 Gen. Grant directed that all units containing former Confederates would be employed on the western frontier. All of the former Confederates in the 1st Connecticut Cavalry were placed into Company GCompany G, 1st Connecticut Cavalry was commanded by Capt. James R. Straut. (O.R. Vol. XLI, p. 997) Straut had enlisted as a sergeant in Company D in October 1861, became first sergeant of Company I in November 1863, reenlisted in December, became 2nd lieutenant of Company I in January 1864, then 1st Lt of Company G in March. He became captain of the company in Minnesota on December 3, 1864. and on April 26, 1864, sent to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, also serving at Forts Ridgely and Ripley. On April 6, 1865, the remaining 40 former Confederates of the company transferred to the U.S. Volunteers and were designated the 1st Independent Company, U.S.V..The first commander after the transfer was 1st Lt. Cyrus L. Hutchins, Worcester, Massachusetts, of the 1st U.S.V.I. (O.R. Vol. XLVIII, p. 264) He had been commissioned from the ranks while in Company A, 25th Massachusetts Volunteers. He returned to the 1st U.S.V.I. in May and led the small detachment dispatched from Fort Rice to Fort Benton, Montana. The 1st Independent Company remained on duty in the District of Minnesota until mustered out on November 16, 1865.Dyer (1904), p. 1717. ;3rd Maryland Cavalry The service of the 3rd Regiment Cavalry, Maryland Volunteers began on August 8, 1864, with the raising of three companies at Baltimore. In September and October, Companies D, E, F, and G were recruited from Confederate prisoners at Fort Delaware, most of whom had been captured at the Battle of Gettysburg, numbering approximately 450 in all. The regiment remained in garrison at Camp Schenck in Baltimore, seeking to raise more troops, assigned to the Cavalry Reserve of the Eighth Corps until officially organized on January 9, 1864. Sent by steamship to New Orleans and Madisonville, Louisiana, the 3rd Maryland Cavalry took part in the Red River Campaign, in the Atchafalaya Expedition in the first week of June 1864,The \\"Atchafalaya Expedition,\\" conducted by Lawler's Division of the Thirteenth Corps, had as its objective the securing of Morgan's Crossing over the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana, used by Confederate forces after the Red River Campaign. The 3rd Maryland Cavalry was assigned to a brigade of cavalry commanded by Col. Morgan H. Chrysler that was the advance guard for the division. and in August was dismounted to participate in the siege of Fort Morgan. Disease seriously depleted the ranks of the regiment, and in December 1864, the 3rd Maryland Cavalry consolidated into a six-company battalion. Company D became part of Company E, and Company G part of Company F, participating in the campaign to capture Mobile, Alabama in March and April 1865. The 3rd Maryland Cavalry was the only unit of \\"galvanized Yankees\\" in Federal service to actively campaign against Confederate forces. At the end of hostilities it was assigned to the Department of Mississippi and garrisoned Natchez, Mississippi, through the summer of 1865. The battalion mustered out at Vicksburg on September 7, 1865.Speer (1997), p. 220.Dyer (1904), p. 1230.The four companies from Fort Delaware were recruited by regimental commander Lt. Col. Charles Carroll Tevis, who as lieutenant colonel of the 4th Delaware Infantry was reputed by Speer to have earlier recruited \\"galvanized Yankees\\" into Company C. An 1839 graduate of West Point, Tevis was a cadet under the name \\"Washington Carrol Tevis\\", served as a lieutenant in the Mounted Rifles, left the service but was appointed to the 4th Delaware in April 1862, then transferred in rank to organize the new 3rd Maryland Cavalry on September 25, 1863. Tevis accompanied the 3rd to Louisiana, but resigned at some point during 1864. (Speer 1997 p. 220; Simmons, \\"Union Volunteers\\"). ;3rd Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery Battery M, 3rd Regiment Heavy Artillery, Pennsylvania VolunteersCapt. Francis H. Reichard commanded Battery M. was raised in Philadelphia, then recruited prisoners at Fort Delaware in July and August 1863 to fill out its ranks. It was apparently over-recruited in numbers. The battery moved to Fortress Monroe to train, where some members were induced to join the newly created 188th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. ;4th Delaware Infantry Company C of the 4th Regiment Infantry, Delaware Volunteers is claimed to have been recruited in 1862 or 1863 from prisoners at Fort Delaware, but claims have not been substantiated through checks of muster rolls.Dyer (1904), p. 1018. ;11th Ohio Cavalry The 11th Regiment Cavalry, Ohio Volunteers was originally raised as four companies of the 7th Ohio Cavalry in October 1861. It was sent west for duty on the Indian frontier in February 1862 to resolve a political dispute after its commander refused to consolidate with the 6th Ohio Cavalry. Permanently detached and given the designation 1st Independent Battalion Ohio Cavalry, it arrived at Fort Laramie on May 30, 1862. Four additional companies were recruited between June 26 and July 31, 1863, including approximately 40 Confederate prisoners from Camp Chase who became members of Company E. Originally called to service to repel John Hunt Morgan's raid through Ohio, the companies were also sent west to combine with the 1st Independent Battalion into the new 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. They left Camp Dennison August 1 for Fort Leavenworth, reporting for duty August 13. While awaiting supplies, the battalion joined in pursuit of Quantrill's Raiders following the Lawrence Massacre. After marching 150 miles, they were recalled and marched to Fort Laramie between September 2 and October 10. En route, four of Company E's recruits plotted to involve all Confederates in the company in a mutiny when it reached Julesburg, but were disarmed and arrested before the attempt could be made.Sentenced by court martial to hard labor, three of the four were summarily executed in 1865 when they tried a second attempt. (Brown 1863 p. 183). In July and August 1864, Capt. Henry E. Palmer was assigned to deliver a detachment of 60 recruits, all former members of Morgan's cavalry force, from Camp Chase to Fort Kearny, where they became Company K of the 11th Ohio Volunteer Cavalry. In August and September 1865 \\"galvanized\\" Companies E and K accompanied Connor's Powder River Expedition. Both companies returned to Fort Laramie, where they continued guard duties along the stage and telegraph lines until mustering out on July 14, 1866.Brown (1963), pp. 181‚Äì183, 185, 190.Dyer (1904), p. 1479. ;Ahl's Battery see Ahl's Heavy Artillery Company Confederate forces composed of \\"galvanized Yankees\\" Confederate recruitment of Union prisoners of war was authorized by Confederate Secretary of War James A. Seddon on September 30, 1864, after inquires from Gen. Braxton Bragg to recruit foreign-born prisoners. Seddon had as early as March 1863 granted discretionary permission to commanders including Gen. John Pemberton to recruit prisoners, but few if any, were actually enlisted.Brown (1963), pp. 211‚Äì212. A concerted recruiting effort began on October 12 and continued to the end of the war. At least four Confederate units were recruited, including three units of Regulars in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States.Cisco (2004), p. 148. =Confederate regulars= ;Brooks' Battalion, Confederate Regular InfantryCommanded by Lt. Col. John Hampden Brooks (formerly captain, 7th South Carolina Infantry). :Recruited from prisoners held at the stockade in Florence, South Carolina, the unit was organized October 10, 1864, as \\"Brooks' Battalion of Foreigners,\\" saw brief front-line service in McLaws Division until December 18, 1864, then was returned to Florence because of desertions and mutiny. ;Tucker's Confederate RegimentCommanded by Col. Julius G. Tucker (formerly captain, 10th Virginia Cavalry). :Recruited from prisons at Florence, South Carolina; Salisbury, North Carolina; and Richmond, Virginia, the unit organized October 16, 1864, as the \\"1st Foreign Battalion,\\" was later increased to regimental size and renamed \\"1st Foreign Legion,\\" then was re- designated February 28, 1865, as Tucker's Confederate Regiment. It had 72 men serving as pioneer troops at the surrender April 26, 1865. ;8th Confederate BattalionCommanded by Lt. Col. Garrett Andrews, Jr., formerly a major on the staff of Maj. Gen. Arnold Elzey. Andrews raised the battalion himself from foreigners among the Union POWs. :Recruited at Florence, South Carolina, the unit organized December 26, 1864, as the \\"2nd Foreign Battalion,\\" later known as \\"2nd Foreign Legion\\", and was re-designated February 13, 1865, as 8th Confederate Battalion. =State volunteer regiments in Confederate service= ;10th Tennessee In October 1864, John G. O'Neill, colonel of the 10th Tennessee Regiment (Irish Volunteers),The 10th Tennessee Regiment (\\"Sons of Erin\\") was organized at Fort Henry in May 1861 from Irish militia companies raised in Nashville, Clarksville, Pulaski, McEwen and their surrounding counties in central Tennessee. The 10th, the 2nd Tennessee, and the 6th Louisiana Volunteers were the three predominantly Irish regiments in the Confederate Army. The 10th's regimental flag was Kelly green, had a gold Irish harp in the center of the field, and was made by the Ladies Soldiers' Friend Society of Nashville, a group that included the widow of former U.S. President James K. Polk. Mustered into CSA service on September 1, 1861, its 720 soldiers wore gray caps, jackets, and pants with scarlet trim furnished by its wealthy lieutenant colonel, attorney and former mayor of Nashville Randal William McGavock, and were initially armed with flintlock muskets. The 10th Tennessee saw action at Fort Donelson, where the regiment surrendered and was held at Camp Douglas, Illinois until September 24, 1862, when it was exchanged at Vicksburg and reorganized with 383 troops. The 10th Tennessee returned to combat at the Battle of Raymond, and participated in the battles of Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the Atlanta campaign and Franklin. Major John G. (\\"Gentleman Johnny\\") O'Neill, an Irish immigrant, led the 10th Tennessee's sharpshooter detachment after initially commanding Company A. He became the fourth and last colonel of the 10th Tennessee in September 1864, succeeding Adolphus Heiman, McGavock, and William \\"Battling Billy\\" Grace, all deceased. was authorized to recruit Union prisoners at Andersonville and Millen, Georgia, to replenish the depleted ranks of the regiment.Many if not most of the original 228 Confederate prisoners recruited at Camp Douglas in early 1862 to the Union side were likely from the 10th Tennessee, and this may have been the origin of O'Neill's request to recruit from Union prisoners. O'Neill, recovering from wounds received at the Battle of Resaca, appears to have delegated part of the task to a newly appointed lieutenant colonel, Michael Burke.Burke, born in Galway, Ireland, had been a merchant in St. Louis when he enlisted in the Confederate 1st Missouri Infantry in June 1861. He saw action at Shiloh and Corinth, serving with the 1st Missouri until August 1864, when he was posted as a major to the staff of Maj. Gen. John B. Hood, where he was serving when Maj. Gen. Pierre G. T. Beauregard assigned him to the 10th Tennessee in September 1864. In October and November 1864 O'Neill and Burke enlisted more than 250 soldiers of a number of Union regiments. Efforts were made at first to recruit Irish immigrants in compliance with Seddon's original instructions, but when few complied, native-born Union soldiers were enlisted. The recruits were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, and were not issued arms or ammunition until the night before their first engagement.Brown (1963), pp. 214‚Äì215. Held under strict camp guard, they were sent to Mobile, Alabama while the 10th Tennessee itself advanced to the Battle of Franklin. Organized as Burke's Battalion, 10th Tennessee, they were made part of an ad hoc defense force assembled by Lt. Col. William W. Wier and sent by train towards Tupelo, Mississippi, to repel a raid along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad by two brigades of Union cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. Benjamin Grierson. The Union cavalry force had already captured a substantial number of Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's dismounted cavalry encamped at Verona on Christmas Day. Burke's Battalion and the 17th Arkansas were sent with a battery of artillery aboard the first train to block the tracks at Egypt Station, a mile west of Aberdeen, Mississippi. On the evening of December 27, 1864, six members of Burke's Battalion deserted and made their way into the Union lines, where they reported the presence of the former prisoners and the likelihood that they would not resist any Union attack. The next morning Grierson's 1st Brigade advanced and came under fire from Confederate skirmishers, including Burke's Battalion, which was ensconced in a stockade east of the rail line. After suffering a number of casualties, the 2nd New Jersey Cavalry responded with a charge in which it took severe casualties, including 22 dead, and lost 80 horses but captured more than 500 prisoners, among whom were Burke and 254 former Union soldiers from Burke's Battalion of the 10th Tennessee. Grierson's prisoners were shipped by steamer to the Union prison camp at Alton, Illinois, where the claims of the \\"galvanized Yankees\\" that they desired restoration to their original units were investigated. Major General Dodge recommended on March 5, 1865, that all the former Union soldiers as well as a number of Confederate troops be enlisted in the U.S. Volunteers for service in the West. The recommendation for clemency was resisted by the Judge Advocate General's Office in Washington, D.C., which advocated that the former Union soldiers be tried for desertion, citing testimony from Union officers at Egypt Station that they resisted at the battle until their ammunition was exhausted. Dodge's recommendation was accepted, however, and the prisoners were permitted to enlist in the 5th and 6th U.S. Volunteers.The bulk of Companies C and D of the 5th U.S.V.I., which also included 69 former Confederate soldiers in their ranks, came from the troops captured at Egypt Station. The two companies marched to Fort Reno on the Powder River, Wyoming in August 1865, suffering 22 desertions en route. They finished construction of the fort, under virtual siege by Indians, and wintered at Fort Reno before being relieved by Col. Henry B. Carrington and the 18th Infantry on June 29, 1866. 104 were left, the rest having deserted or died of illness. Companies C and D rejoined the main body of the 5th U.S.V.I. at Fort Kearney and were mustered out of service on October 11. (Brown 1963, pp. 122‚Äì136). O'Neill returned to Andersonville and recruited 150 more prisoners for the 10th Tennessee in January 1865, and approximately 165 more in March.

Huddleston R v Lancashire County Council, ex p Huddleston [1986] 2 All ER 941 stated that public servants should be willing 'to explain fully what has occurred and why'. There is also a contractual duty of candour imposed on all NHS and non- NHS providers of services to NHS patients in the UK to 'provide to the service user and any other relevant person all necessary support and all relevant information' in the event that a 'reportable patient safety incident' occurs. A 'reportable patient safety incident' is one which could have or did result in moderate or severe harm or death. Campaigner Will Powell led a campaign for NHS managers and doctors to have a formal 'duty of candour' when dealing with complaints about negligent or poor standards of care in NHS hospitals. In January 2014 David Behan, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, threw his weight behind a wide definition for the statutory duty of candour which was recommended by the Francis Report. The Government originally intended the duty to be limited to cases of ‚Äúsevere harm‚Äù ‚Äì when a patient had been killed or left permanently disabled, as a wider reporting requirement could inundate organisations with unnecessary bureaucracy. The CQC estimates there are about 11,000 incidents of severe harm per year, and up to 100,000 incidents of serious harm, although there may be significant under reporting of both. The charity Action Against Medical Accidents has been campaigning for a wide definition and Behan made it clear that he was supporting them.

Most tropical freshwater and marine aquariums are maintained at temperatures that range from 22-30 ¬∞C (71-86 ¬∞F).Sands D (1994) A fishkeepers guide to Central American cichlids. Tetra Press. Belgium pg 59-60.Mills D (1993) Aquarium Fish Harper Collins The types include glass immersion heaters and undergravel heating. There are also heating mats that may be placed under the aquarium. Glass immersion heaters Most commonly, aquarium heaters are immersion style heaters, these heaters consist of a glass tube containing a heating element wound around a ceramic or glass insert. Some glass immersion heaters also contain sand, and most, but not all, are fully submersible. The glass tube also contains an adjustable thermostat which turns the heating element on to maintain the required temperature. This thermostat is often a bimetallic strip; because the strip contains two metals, the metals will expand at different rates when the temperature rises, causing the strip to bend. This strip carries the current, but breaks the current at the correct temperature. The setting of this bimetallic strip can be adjusted. More advanced thermostats may use microchip technology. A small light in the heater is often included to indicate operation. In a small aquarium, one heater can be used; however, in a larger aquarium, two or more may be used. This has the added advantage of one heater being able to compensate in the event of one heater malfunctioning. Undergravel heating Heating of the aquarium can also be achieved via a heating element in the form of a flexible heating cable that is buried beneath the aquarium substrate. Undergravel cable heating is popular in heavily planted aquariums. Undertank heating Aquaria can also be heated by the use of heating mats which are placed beneath aquaria. Glass is, however, a poor conductor of heat and thus reduces the efficiency of this method of heating.

This version was also directed by Hawks, based on the story \\"From A to Z\\" by Billy Wilder and Thomas Monroe, adapted by Harry Tugend (uncredited) and produced by Samuel Goldwyn and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Filmed in Technicolor, it featured a stellar supporting cast of musical legends, including Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman (with Al Hendrickson as cameo), Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter. Other notable musicians playing themselves in the cast include Charlie Barnet (with Harry Babasin as cameo), Mel Powell, Louis Bellson, The Golden Gate Quartet, Russo and the Samba Kings, The Page Cavanaugh Trio, and Buck and Bubbles. Other actors include Steve Cochran and Hugh Herbert. Plot Mild-mannered Professor Hobart Frisbee (Danny Kaye) and his fellow academics, among them Professor Magenbruch (Benny Goodman), are writing a musical encyclopedia. In the process, they discover that there is some new popular music that is called jazz, swing, boogie woogie or bebop, introduced to them by two window washers Buck and Bubbles. The professors become entangled in the problems of nightclub singer Honey Swanson (Virginia Mayo). She needs a place to hide out from the police, who want to question her about her gangster boyfriend Tony Crow (Steve Cochran). She invites herself into their sheltered household, over Frisbee's objections. While there, she introduces them to the latest in jazz, with which they are unfamiliar, giving the film an excuse to feature many of the best musicians of the era. The songs they play include \\"A Song Is Born\\", \\"Daddy-O\\", \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\\", \\"Flying Home\\", and \\"Redskin Rumba\\". Eventually, Tony comes by to collect Honey, but by that time, she and Hobart have fallen in love. And the finale, of course, is not decided by guns but by music, its resonance and reverberation.

Kaye didn't want anyone else writing songs for him, so he did not perform any songs in the film.Nobody's Fool: The Lives of Danny Kaye. Martin Gottfried. Simon and Schuster, 1994, Hawks had little interest in remaking his own earlier movie, and only came to work on it because of the $250,000 paycheck. When speaking of the film, he said \\"Danny Kaye had separated from his wife, and he was a basket case, stopping work to see a psychiatrist [every] day. He was about as funny as a crutch. I never thought anything in that picture was funny. It was an altogether horrible experience...and Virginia Mayo's performance was 'pathetic'... she's not Barbara Stanwyck, I'll tell you that.\\" Release A Song Is Born was the number one film in the country from the time of its release until November 1948, while Hawks's other (and in his opinion, best) film, Red River, was second. However, A Song Is Born never broke even, only earning about $2.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ), while Red River went on to gross $4.1 million. It has since been released on home video in both VHS and DVD formats.

It was Raven Software's debut title, and was published for the Amiga by Electronic Arts in 1992. Its 3D realtime style is similar to FTL Games' popular Dungeon Master, where the player leads a party of four heroes through a large dungeon to ultimately confront and defeat a powerful enemy.  Gameplay  The player is given the task of creating four heroes to traverse the twenty-eight levels of the \\"Tomb of the Four Heroes\\"Maps of \\"Tomb of Four Heroes from Raven Software to defeat the evil Estoroth Paingiver. Estoroth, a powerful cleric, had been banished to a black crypt for committing unspeakable acts. The guilds of the country of Astera believe Estoroth is attempting to unseal his crypt, and send the four heroes to seal him away for good. Unlike Dungeon Master, Black Crypt does not have pre-generated characters to select as possible heroes. When starting a new game the player must first create and name their four heroes, who are of set class (fighter, cleric, magic user and druid), as well as set their starting attributes. While most games of this type did not include maps of the dungeon (meaning players often mapped them out themselves on paper) the magic user has access to a spell called \\"Wizard Sight\\" which automatically maps the heroes movement and can be viewed in-game while the spell is active. Black Crypt also features 'bosses' on several levels, the first of which is actually within twenty spaces of the start location.  Development  Black Crypt was originally conceived by Brian Raffel and Steve Raffel in the late 1980s as a non-electrical game set for pen-and-paper role-playing games, although work began in April 1990 to eventually turn their idea into a video game. According to a pre-release blurb in The One, Black Crypt consists of 12 interconnected dungeons rendered in 64-colour extra half-brite graphics, and an EA spokesman purported that Electronic Arts \\"like to think of the game as a dungeon simulator rather than a game.\\" Black Crypt and came on three 880k disks (excluding a game-save disk, used if not installed on a hard drive). The graphics mode used was called Extra Half-Bright, which allowed for a user defined palette of thirty-two colours, as well as an additional thirty-two colours which were half the brightness of the chosen palette, allowing for the game's gloomy atmosphere.  Reception  Black Crypt received an 83% from German reviewer Amiga Joker. Amiga Power gave the Amiga version of Black Crypt an overall score of 85%, the reviewer begins their review remarking their disdain for RPGs, calling them \\"escapism for accountants\\" but expressing that \\"[Black Crypt] somehow managed to draw me in and keep me there\\". Amiga Power criticised the game's plot as \\"boring\\", and calls Black Crypt \\"aesthetically unremarkable\\" and the title sequence \\"dull\\" and accompanying music \\"unsuitable rubbish\\", and sound effects 'unatmospheric' .Amiga Power furthermore calls it 'unoriginal' and expresses that Black Crypt appears based on Dungeon Master, and states that \\"The variety of monsters is not wide and none of them seem out of the ordinary.\\" Despite these criticisms, Amiga Power's reviewer expresses that they \\"quickly found myself excusing its flaws, and despite a lack of atmosphere there was a healthy feeling that progress was being made. Not once did I reach the stage where I thought 'Now what?' and that impresses me. ... beneath it all, it's actually a rather absorbing and playable game.\\" The One gave the Amiga version of Black Crypt an overall score of 92%, initially comparing it to Dungeon Master, but expressing that Black Crypt is a 'unique' RPG that sets itself apart from others, calling it \\"The state of the art in 3D role-playing games\\". The One praises Black Crypt's graphics and gameplay, stating that \\"Black Crypt is easily the best 3D role-playing game available on the Amiga. Aside from cosmetic improvements like smoother animation and superior artwork, it boasts features that are clearly the product of some thought being applied in the planning stages. ... What finally tips the balance in Black Crypt's favour is the delicate line between mental effort and combat and the superb way the plot leads you through the game.\\" The One further praises the sound and controls, expressing that \\"sound effects in Black Crypt provide the player with often vital clues as to what's going on\\" and calling the controls 'admirable' and that they're \\"so intutitive that five minutes into the game you won't even notice [you're using it]\\".  Legacy  In 1998, Raven Software programmer Rick Johnson released the first two levels of Black Crypt for the PC as freeware.

These mushrooms are saprotrophic and most grow on the ground, but some are found on wood. Most are drab in appearance, though a few have vivid colors. Description The cap shape can be convex, plane, or depressed. The gills usually have adnate to decurrent attachment, rarely notched and the stems of the mushrooms are highly variable, but always lack a veil or volva. The spores are flesh-colored to salmon to brownish pink. Microscopically the shape of the spores is important in defining the group. About 20 species of Rhodocybe have been documented in Europe, but R. gemina (sometimes wrongly named R. truncata) is the commonest and best known, though rare in Britain. The type species is Rhodocybe caelata (Fr.) Maire. Little is known about the edibility of Rhodocybes, but one prominent mushroom guide indicates that R. gemina (or Clitopilus geminus) is good to eat. Taxonomic status The group belongs to family Entolomataceae (with pink spore print and angular spores) and the members are similar to some Entoloma or Clitopilus species, being distinguished by spore shape; essentially Entoloma spores are polyhedral (angular in all views), Clitopilus spores have longitudinal ridges, and Rhodocybes spores are angular when viewed on end but bumpy to weakly angular when viewed from the side. But in 2009, CoDavid et al. found that Clitopilus species form a clade nested within the Rhodocybe species and proposed that these genera should be merged so that the new genus would be monophyletic. Since the name Clitopilus is older, it takes precedence and the name Rhodocybe should be dropped. Rhodocybe is divided into four subsections - Rhodocybe, Rhodophana (now considered a separate genus according to Species Fungorum and a paper of 2013), Decurrentes, and Rufobrunneua.

It was key to the Industrial Revolution. Wales was famous for its coal mining, in the Rhondda Valley, the South Wales Valleys and throughout the South Wales coalfield and by 1913 Barry had become the largest coal exporting port in the world, with Cardiff as second, as coal was transported down by rail. Northeast Wales also had its own coalfield and Tower Colliery (closed January 2008) near Hirwaun is regarded by many as the oldest open coal mine and one of the largest in the world. Wales has also had a significant history of mining for slate, gold and various metal ores. History 220px There had been small-scale mining in Wales in the pre-Roman British Iron Age, but it would be undertaken on an industrial scale under the Romans, who completed their conquest of Wales in AD 78. Substantial quantities of gold, copper, and lead were extracted, along with lesser amounts of zinc and silver. Mining would continue until the process was no longer practical or profitable, at which time the mine would be abandoned. The extensive excavations of the Roman operations at Dolaucothi provide a picture of the high level of Roman technology and the expertise of Roman engineering in the ancient era. =Coal mining= There is evidence of mining in the Blaenavon area going back to the 14th century, and there is evidence of mine workings at Mostyn as far back as 1261,The History of the Parishes of Whiteford and Holywell; Thomas Pennant, 1796, p.133 but it is believed to have been practised even as early as Roman times. The coal mining industry burgeoned throughout the Industrial Revolution and into the 19th century, when shafts were sunk to complement the open-cast mining and drift mining already exploiting the ample and obvious coal resources. 150px During the first half of the nineteenth century mining was often at the centre of working-class discontent in Wales, and a number of uprisings such as the Merthyr Rising in 1831 against employers were a characteristic of the Industrial Revolution in Wales, Dic Penderyn became a martyr to industrial workers. The Chartist movement and the 1839 Newport Rising showed the growing concerns and awareness of the work force of their value to the nation. Although the Factory Acts of the 1830s and resultant Mines Act of 1842 were meant to prevent women and boys under 10 years of age from working underground, it is believed they were widely ignored. To replace female and child labour the pit pony was more widely introduced. Much later, in the middle of the 20th century, mining was still a hazardous enterprise, resulting in many accidents and long term ill- health with many retired miners still suffering from silicosis and other mining related diseases. Incorporating the existing Coity colliery and Kearsley's pit (sunk in 1860), the Big Pit opened in 1880, so called because it was the first shaft in Wales large enough to allow two tramways. At the height of coal production, there were over 160 drift mines and over 30 shafts working the nine seams in the Blaenavon locality. Big Pit alone employed some 1,300 men digging a quarter of a million tons of coal a year. Large amounts of coal were needed to supply the local ironworks, as it took 3 tons of coal to produce a ton of iron. Blaenavon 'steam' coal was of high quality and it was exported globally. Burning hotly while leaving minimum ash, it was ideal to power the steam engines that drove steamships, Dreadnoughts of the Royal Navy and steam locomotive railways across the world. However both economics and politics after World War I with its resultant general strike, the 1930s Depression and later Nationalisation and the miners' strike of 1984-1985 took their toll and all the smaller pits were either abandoned or swallowed into Big Pit's encroaching search for new seams. Finally in February 1980 the coal ran out and even Big Pit, then the oldest mine in Wales, had to close. There are still nine headstocks remaining in Wales, including Big Pit (the metal frame erected in 1921 during the Miners' Strike of that year, to replace a wooden structure). There is a well-known mining song part in Welsh and part in English. I am a little collier and gweithio underground The raff will never torri when I go up and down It's bara when I'm hungry And cwrw when I'm dry It's gwely when I'm tired And nefoedd when I die The complete English translation is the following. I am a little collier and working underground The rope will never break when I go up and down It's bread when I'm hungry And beer when I'm dry It's bed when I'm tired And heaven when I die Big Pit museum at Blaenavon =Big Pit National Coal Museum & other mining museums in Wales= The Big Pit National Coal Museum is located at Blaenavon, and in 2005 it won the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize for museum of the year. It is one of only two remaining mines where it is possible for visitors to journey to the underground workings some 300 ft (90 m) below using the same cages that transported the miners. Other museums preserving the memories and heritage of the coal mining industry in Wales are at : *South Wales Miners' Museum near Cymmer *Cefn Coed Colliery Museum near Crynant *Rhondda Heritage Park near Trehafod =Slate quarrying= There has been slate quarrying in Wales since the Roman period, when slate was used to roof the fort at Segontium, now Caernarfon. The slate industry grew slowly until the early 18th century, then expanded rapidly until the late 19th century, at which time the most important slate producing areas were in northwest Wales, including the Penrhyn Quarry near Bethesda, the Dinorwic Quarry near Llanberis, the Nantlle Valley quarries, and Blaenau Ffestiniog, where the slate was mined rather than quarried. Penrhyn and Dinorwig were the two largest slate quarries in the world, and the Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog was the largest slate mine in the world. Slate is mainly used for roofing, but is also produced as thicker slab for a variety of uses including flooring, worktops and headstones. The slate industry in North Wales is on the tentative World Heritage Site list whilst Welsh slate has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource. =Metal mining= Metal mining in Wales affected large areas of what are now very rural parts of Wales and left behind a legacy of contaminated waste heaps and a very few ruined buildings. There are a number of areas that have been mined for a variety of metals. Gold mining Gold was mined as early as the Roman period at Dolaucothi in Carmarthenshire and possibly elsewhere. In the 19th century gold was being extracted from a number of small mines at the southern end of Snowdonia with most activity centred in the valley of the River Mawddach and its tributaries. Lead and silver Cwmystwyth Mine from the hill-side immediately above the mine. Winter in 1985 when many buildings were still standing The principal areas were centred on the upland areas of the River Ystwyth and River Rheidol with some outliers to the east in the catchment of the River Severn and some to the south in the headwaters of the River Teifi. The largest of these mines were the Cwmystwyth and Rheidol United mines in Cwm Rheidol. The ore extracted was galena which in many cases had a high silver content, especially at Cwm Ystwyth. It also occurred alongside large quantities of sphalerite, the principal ore of zinc. However, the zinc was only occasionally processed and much remains on the very extensive discard heaps around the mines. Amongst the very many mines that have existed the following list identifies those known to have existed between the 17th and 19th centuries in north Cardiganshire and west Montgomeryshire: Aberffrwd, Alma, Blaenceunant, Blaencwmsymlog, Bron floyd, Bryn Glas, Bwa Drain, Bwlch, Cwm Mawr, Cwmystwyth, Cwm Ystwyth South, Cwm Ystwyth West, Cwmbryno, Cwmdarren, Cwmsymlog, De Broke, Dyffryn Castell, Elgar, Esgair Lle, Esgairmwyn, Fron Goch, Fron Goch East, Gelli, Glog fach, Glog Fawr, Goginan, Goginan west, Graig Goch, Grogwynion, Gwaith coch, Lisburne South, Llwynmalus, Llywernog, Logau Las, Melindwr, Mynyddgorddu, Nanteos, Pen Rhiw, Powell, Rheidol United, Temple, Ystumtuen Metal mining in the Gwydir Forest dates back to the 17th century, but its heyday came in the latter half of the 19th century. These mines predominantly produced lead and zinc, and the last mine to close ‚Äì Park Mine ‚Äì closed in the 1960s.mindat.org Smaller areas of lead exploitation included Halkyn Mountain in Flintshire and in the Clyne valley in west Swansea. Copper Copper mining is probably the oldest known mining activity in Wales with documented evidence of Bronze Age mining on the Great Orme near Llandudno and at Copa Hill in the valley of the River Ystwyth in Ceredigion. Further copper discoveries were exploited in Snowdonia just to the east of Beddgelert where the Sygun Copper Mine, within the Snowdonia National Park, gives an idea of the conditions faced by copper miners and is a popular tourist attraction. In the 18th century the massive deposits of copper together with a range of other metals was discovered and exploited at Parys Mountain on Anglesey. Iron Commercial iron ore exploitation has been relatively uncommon in Wales during the last hundred years, despite the dominance of the iron and steel industry in South Wales. However ironstone is a component of the Lower Coal Measures rock sequence and where it outcrops along the northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield, it was extensively worked for the production of iron and was important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Blaenavon Ironworks information Commercial exploitation also took place in the Vale of Glamorgan. The Forest of Dean was an important source of iron for many centuries, and dates from at least the Roman period. Lead Lead ore was first mined in North Wales during Roman times at Pentre Halkyn to be smelted at Flint. The lead that was produced there was stamped with the inscription Deceangli, which was the name of the Celtic tribe occupying the area. In the 17th century an intensive period of Welsh lead mining commenced, bringing a large number of miners from Derbyshire into Wales. There are substantial reserves of the metal in Ceredigion, probably first exploited in the Roman period, and extensively during the revival of metal mining in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. =Arsenic= Arsenic has been mined in association with metals and in Wales commercial extraction has probably only occurred in the Clyne valley near Swansea. Working mines Following the miners' strike, only two deep mines remained working in Wales. Tower Colliery, Hirwaun, had been run by a miner's co-operative since 1994. Due to dwindling coal seams, the colliery was last worked on 18 January 2008, followed by official closure on 25 January. Drift mining continued at Aberpergwm Colliery, a smaller mine closed by the National Coal Board in 1985 but reopened in 1996. Aberpergwm colliery is currently owned and operated by Energybuild and supplies the carbon market. Several other small mines still exist, including the Blaentillery drift mine near to the Big Pit National Coal Museum.

Tension relaxes when Mel goes on a holiday with cop mate Abi Sharpe (Rachael Elizabeth), but when Mel returns she is angry that Teresa is still living at No. 6 and Teresa manipulates Jerry, after he offers to move her into a flat. She lies by saying that the flat needs rewiring, as well as protesting that Jerry is increasingly unwell and pale, so Jerry lets her move back in. Mel soon discovers Teresa's lie and the mother and daughter have an argument. Mel later gives Jerry an ultimatum ‚Äì Teresa moves out or she does, resulting in Mel going to stay at Abi's, later that episode, Jerry collapses and bangs his head on the coffee table leaving him with a bleeding ear. Teresa later confesses to Jerry whilst he is in hospital that she had been giving him extra medication so that he would depend on her more. In September 2008, Teresa helps Mel get revenge after she is involved in a fight with a vicious girl gang which results in Abi being severely injured and being discharged from the police. Mel follows the ringleader of the gang to a bar, where she in turn is followed by Teresa. Mel intends to attack the girl, however Teresa convinces her not to as it would destroy her career. Mel sees sense and leaves, however unknownest to her, Teresa sneaks into the toilet and attacks the girl herself, landing her in hospital after landing blow to the head with the heel of her show. As a result, Mel and Teresa temporarily reconcile and settle their differences. However, when Mel discovers that Teresa had plotted to poison Jerry, they fall out again and Mel arrests Teresa for attempted murder. The police later release her after Jerry denies that she tried to kill him. Teresa then turns up at No.6 that night begging for forgiveness but Jerry and the kids order her to leave. In October 2008, Darryl brings a drunken Teresa back to the house much to the disgruntlement of Mel who packs her things and leaves home unable to be under the same roof as her mother. Teresa causes Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) to quit her job at the Prima Doner and begins working there herself alongside Darryl. Prior to her departure on 8 December 2008, Teresa causes the Windasses, the new family whom Jerry agrees to rent No. 6 to, trouble when they can't move in due to Teresa barricading herself in the house all day. She refuses to move out after her and Darryl are evicted from their home. This causes the family's son Gary (Mikey North) to smash the door window to get to Teresa. However, when they get into the house, they discover that feisty Teresa has handcuffed herself to the oven and cupboard door, causing Gary to rip out the doors and throw her out of the house. She leaves the Street following her and Darryl's eviction from their house at 6 Coronation Street. Teresa reappears in Weatherfield on 13 April 2009. She turns up at Roy's Rolls extremely drunk wanting to see Darryl as it is his birthday. However, she is quickly ejected by Anna Windass (Debbie Rush). Later, Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) says that she can stay in the flat above the corner shop as she has nowhere to live, on the condition that Darryl would stay there with her. She subsequently gets her old job back at the takeaway much to the disapproval of Minnie Chandra (Poppy Jhakra) who does not want to work with her. Teresa is happy when she discovers that Dev has paid Darryl to move to Spain and break up with his daughter Amber (Nikki Patel), because he does not think Darryl is good enough for her. Teresa happily tells Amber what her father has done and Amber breaks up with Darryl and leaves for Oxford University, angry with Dev. Darryl throws Teresa out for this and the next day Lloyd finds her asleep in his taxi. She later has an argument with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) in the street, and when Liz and Lloyd also have an argument, he and Teresa go back to his place and have sex. Lloyd later gets back together with Liz and tells her he slept with someone that night but does not say who. Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) soon tells her, and a fight breaks out in the pub between Liz and Teresa. Whilst attempting to punch Liz, Teresa accidentally punches Lloyd. Teresa subsequently goes on to have a casual relationship with Lloyd. In March 2010, Teresa begins working in Underworld as a cleaner to the amusement of the manual workers. After Kelly Crabtree (Tupele Dorgu) intentionally dirties the floor, Teresa attacks her with a mop which prompts Carla (Alison King) to break up the fight and sack Teresa on her first day of work. Shortly after, however, she regains her job after a grovelling apology. In May 2010, Teresa soon realises that Lloyd has lost interest in her, becoming closer to lapdancer Cheryl Gray (Holly Quin-Ankrah). Liz advises Teresa to walk away from Lloyd with her head held high. She later leaves Lloyd's flat with a packed bag, announcing that she is leaving him and the Street for pastures new. After a final kiss, Lloyd walks off as Teresa waits for the bus, clearly upset and lost, she calls one of her children, presumingly Darryl, asking him for a favour, hence returning into his life once more. Personality and identity Covering Teresa's interference with Jerry's medication, msn.co.uk described her as \\"evil\\". Henthorn, however, has refuted this aspect of her character, stating that \\"Teresa's far too wrapped up in herself to think through the consequences of what she's doing, because that would mean she'd have to take some responsibility for her actions! But she does not mean any real harm ‚Äì she's just buying herself more time.\\" Expanding on this, she added; \\"It's interesting to play Teresa this way, because ‚Äì believe it or not ‚Äì she does actually care for Jerry, and does not like the fact that she's making him ill. She's still being selfish though. I've never been a baddie before, so it's fantastic bringing Teresa to life. I think of her more as confused and a bit lost than evil ‚Äì but she's playing a dangerous game, messing with Jerry's health like this...\\" In an interview with ITV publicity, Henthorn spoke at length of her character saying: \\"Teresa is an opportunist, a survivor, and resourceful. What I like about her is that she does not give a stuff, but she does care what people think about her, but really her mouth just gets carried away with itself and she does not think and she just says how she feels.\\" She also spoke about her character's treatment of her children stating: \\"She's very manipulative; she's a free spirit and she does not really care about her kids. She never wanted them. She's an old clubber, she's an old soak, they get in her way ‚Äì oh, unless of course she can gets something out of them. Which is like a free flat, some food or a job off her son, but she's a terrible mother, she's terrible. It's great playing a terrible mother.\\" Defending Bryant after a newspaper slammed the character she said: \\"I once read in a newspaper that she is an intoxicated harpy, but I think she is a bundle of fun. But then I would! I absolutely love her to bits, But then I wouldn't want to be her friend.\\" See also *List of Coronation Street characters (2007) *List of soap opera villains References External links * Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Female characters in television Category:Female villains Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Teresa Bryant"},{"id":"10486069","text":"Antoni Szylling (31 August 1884 ‚Äì 17 June 1971) was a Polish general, considered, along with Generals Wiktor Thomm√©e and Stanis≈Çaw Maczek, to have been one of the most successful Polish Army commanders during the Invasion of Poland of 1939. Biography Antoni Szyling was born in P≈Çoniawy-Bramura. He finished a 7-year trade school in 1904 and from an early age was an active member of the Polish pro-independence nationalist paramilitary organization the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party. He had several safehouses, in which he stored bibu≈Ça and arms, as well as hiding wanted PPS members and members of other organizations. Arrested by the authorities of the Russian Empire, he served several one-and-a-half-month sentences in the Warsaw Citadel and Dani≈Ç≈Çiczowski Prison. He was also denied the right to study at a university and was conscripted into the Russian Army for two years (1905‚Äì1907). In 1910, he married Zofia Bajkowski (1887‚Äì1944). In the years 1909‚Äì1912 he was able to finish 'industrial-agricultural courses' at the Higher Agricultural School in Warsaw, and from 1912 to 1913 he worked on an experimental folwark in Szamocin. In 1914 he was mobilized into the Russian Army again and fought in the First World War. In 1917, with the rank of captain, he joined the Polish 2nd Corps in the East. In 1918 he was promoted to major, and soon afterwards taken prisoner by the Germans. In January 1919 he joined the Polish Army. During the Polish-Soviet War he commanded the 44th Infantry Regiment. In 1922 he was promoted to colonel and later retired at his own request. In 1925 he was commissioned again and became the commander of the 28th Infantry Division in Warsaw. Later he commanded the 23rd Infantry Division in Katowice and the 8th Infantry Division in Modlin. In 1929 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general (genera≈Ç brygady). In May 1937 he worked at the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces in Silesia. During the German attack on Poland (1939) that started World War II he commanded Army Krak√≥w. This army was the main pivot of Polish defence. Its main task was to delay advancing German troops and withdraw eastwards along the northern line of the Carpathians and defend the heavily industrialized Upper Silesia region. It consisted of four infantry divisions (6th, 7th, 23rd and 55th), two mountain infantry divisions (21st and 22nd), one mountain brigade and two cavalry brigades: one motorized (10th) and one standard (Krak√≥w). It was the most southwestern of the Polish Armies, with Army ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to its north and Army Karpaty to its southeast. During the early stages of the Battle of the Border the northern Army ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was partially surrounded by quickly advancing German forces. Army Krak√≥w, attacked by the German 14th Army under the command of General Wilhelm List, was forced to retreat to protect its flanks from 2 September onwards. A careful tactician, General Szylling followed the strategy of 'retreat to fight another day' instead of engaging the superior enemy. General Szylling, despite the increasingly difficult situation for the Polish forces, was able to retreat successfully towards the city of Lublin, following his orders and avoiding several German attempts to surround him. Pawe≈Ç Wieczorkiewicz, Wrzesie≈Ñ 1939, M√≥wiƒÖ Wieki, t. 9 (2002), s. 24-30 . 471 online On 19 September Szyling's forces joined with Army Lublin of General Tadeusz Piskor in the Battle of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski, the second largest tank battleMichal Derela: The Vickers Mk. E light tank in the Polish service. Last accessed on 11 March 2007 of the campaign. Polish forces followed the plan of General Piskor, but the German defences proved too strong and the majority of Polish forces, including the headquarters of both generals, were encircled and surrendered on 20 September. Hence General Szylling became a German prisoner for the second time. He spent most of the war in the Oflag VII-A Murnau POW camp. On 30 April 1945 he was freed by advancing American forces; he decided not to return to Polish Communist-controlled Poland, but emigrated to France and later to the United Kingdom and, finally, to Canada (in 1947). In 1949 he married Maria R√≥≈ºa Dobrowolska (1896‚Äì1986). He lived on a farm at Abercorn, near Montreal, where he died on 17 June 1971. He is buried in Saint-Sauveur, Quebec. He actually died at the Maria (Curie) Sklodowski Polish Home for the Aged on Belanger Street in Montreal. After emigrating he wrote a monograph, Moje dowodzenie we wrze≈õniu 1939 (\\"My command in September 1939\\").

A giant message board helps people locate friends and loved ones at the Reliant Center. Thousands of displaced citizens were moved from New Orleans to Houston in a FEMA organized bus program. Internally displaced persons in the United States are people from the Gulf States region in the southern United States, most notably New Orleans, Louisiana, who were forced to leave their homes due to the devastation brought on by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and were unable to return due to a multitude of factors, and are collectively known as the Gulf Coast diaspora, are by standard definition considered IDPs.http://www.atha.se/sites/default/files/ATHA%20IDP%20101%2002a%20IDP%20definition%20Dec%202010_0.pdf At their peak, hurricane evacuee shelters housed 273,000 people and, later, FEMA trailers housed at least 114,000 households.https://www.datacenterresearch.org/data-resources/katrina/facts- for-impact/ Even a decade after Hurricane Katrina, many victims who were forced to relocate were still unable to return home. In 2005, around 1,500,000 people from Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were forced to leave their homes due to Hurricane Katrina. Around 40% of evacuees, mostly people from Louisiana, were not able to return home. 25% of evacuees relocated within 10-miles of their previous county. 25% of evacuees relocated at least 450-miles away. 10% of evacuees relocated at least 830-miles away. \\"Returning home can be an important step for the health and economic stability of low- income, climate-displaced families. Evidence indicates that the climate displaced, particularly those who are low income, can suffer from greater hardships than they did prior to evacuation.\\" The population of New Orleans fell from 484,674 before Katrina (April 2000) to an estimated 230,172 after Katrina (July 2006)‚Äîa decrease of 254,502 and a loss of over half of the city's population. By July 2015, the population was back up to 386,617‚Äî80% of what it was in 2000. However, not all those who moved to the city were returning residents. After Hurricane Katrina the privatization push gained momentum. With the opportunity to enact proposals that had circulated since the mid-1980s, the city council voted unanimously to demolish 4,500 units of traditional public housing. In just over a decade‚Äîfrom 1996 to 2007‚Äîthe city managed to close 85% of the city's public housing, adopting a system of \\"mixed-income\\" projects and vouchers instead. While liberals touted it as \\"deconcentration,\\" the removal project effectively (and efficiently) displaced low-income residents from areas ripe for profit-making. As a result, 16,000 families remain on the waitlist for subsidized housing.Katrina and Rita IDPs are not of concern to, and therefore not counted by, UNHCR (, UNHCR, Table 14, p. 94).

C.. It is administered by the Jesuits since its founding and is named for St. Aloysius Gonzaga. It is often associated with Gonzaga College High School, to which it is physically connected. The church building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012 the parish was closed and merged with Holy Redeemer church. History The church building was constructed in 1859 and catered to many of the Irish Catholics that resided in the surrounding neighborhoods, particularly Swampoodle. The New York Times reported that President James Buchanan and several Cabinet members were present for the dedication of the church on October 16, 1859. Jesuit Father Benedict Sestini, a Mathematics teacher at Georgetown University, served as the church's architect. The painting above the main altar, showing Aloysius Gonzaga receiving his first Holy Communion from the hands of Cardinal (St.) Charles Borromeo, was the work of the noted Constantino Brumidi, who is famous for painting the frescoes in the rotunda of the United States Capitol. Brumidi was a friend of Father Sestini and depicted him and the pastor, Father Bernadine Wiget, in the painting. The model for St. Aloysius' mother was parishioner Adele Cutts Douglas, wife of Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas. On September 9, 1862, three years after the church was dedicated, the District of Columbia's military governor made a requisition to Father Wiget to use the church as a military hospital. This was at height of the Civil War and shortly after the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Pastor made a counter-proposal which was within the requirements and time-frame of the military governor. Father Wiget offered to erect a hospital on K Street just north of the church and parishioners completed the 250-bed hospital in only eight days. In appreciation, the hospital was named St. Aloysius to honor the Church. The church, one of the largest in Washington, D.C., has undergone several renovations/restorations. In 1892, the church was repainted, the current solid oak pews were added, and upgrades were made the heating system of the massive church. The church's interior was again painted in the 1930s. In 1958, Gibbons and Associates, a renowned church-decorating firm created a new interior scheme that incorporated mauve and teal with silver leaf accents. By 1964, the area which served the diocese was changing rapidly, with urban development and high rise office buildings destroying the old neighborhood of small houses, with a primarily black population. In that year, Father Horace McKenna, S.J., was brought from Ridge, Maryland, to serve as assistant pastor. Through the efforts of Father McKenna and the formal sponsorship of Georgetown University as well as Gonzaga College High School, a new housing development was created, through which the original residents would be given priority in housing. Washington attorney Eugene L. Stewart, a prominent Washington attorney, provided expert technical advice in bringing the project, named Sursum Corda (Lift up your hearts) to completion. Located between L and M Streets at First Street, N.W., Sursum Corda's original number of occupants was 1,100, of whom 700 were under 16. The housing project won architectural awards for the dignity of its design, in recognition that the project had created a village instead of a project. Simultaneously with the development of the new housing, an emergency feeding program grew to a formal organization called SOME (So Others Might Eat). Dr. Veronia Maz, a sociologist at Georgetown University, Father McKenna, Father Ralph Kuehner, Rev. Griffin Smith of EEFO (Efforts for Ex-Offenders), Father Roger Gallagher and Father James Casey of St. Joseph's Church on Capitol Hill joined together. The first meal was served on July 1, 1971. In the mid 1970s with the majority of the neighborhood surrounded blighted and razed for office building construction, the dwindling congregation abandoned the upper sanctuary and retreated to the basement church for more than twenty-five years. St. Aloysius Catholic Church hosts a Mass for Immigrants on March 21, 2010 before the March for America. In October 1993, the parish began a complete restoration of the sanctuary. It selected Church Restoration Services as general contractor and decorator under the guidance of architect Duane Cahill. This $1.6 million interior renovation/restoration required scaffolding the entire sanctuary in order to replaster the more than 28,000 s.f. of wall area and installed 28 new ceiling panels with replicated plaster medallions. The sanctuary area was extended into the nave by removing much of the marble communion rail and building a larger altar area. In this renovation, the church was made handicapped accessible. Under the direction of Stephen J. Ferrandi, the current color scheme incorporating various shades of blue accents over a base of cream colored walls accentuated by 23-carat gold leaf was installed. Upon completion of the restoration, the Painters and Decorators Contractors Association awarded this project the status of Best Restoration in the United States for 1994. The project was completed in July 1994. In 2012, the parish merged with Holy Redeemer Church and the church was maintained and used by Gonzaga College High School. The Father McKenna Center continued to operate in the basement of the church. On April 6, 2017, a tornado caused significant damage to St. Aloysius Church, destroying part of the roof and causing damage to the interior. No one at Gonzaga College High School was hurt.

Born in Toledo, Ohio, he graduated from Woodward High School (Toledo) in 1960. College career Komives played college basketball at Bowling Green State University (BGSU), where he led the team in scoring in each of his three varsity seasons. As a starting shooting guard, he teamed with Nate Thurmond, the school's all-time leading rebounder, to lead the Falcons to back-to-back Mid-American Conference (MAC) championships and NCAA tournament appearances in 1962 and 1963. Despite Thurmond's graduation and the team's fall to third place in the conference, Komives led the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in scoring during the 1963‚Äì64 season with 36.7 points per game, still BGSU and MAC records.Komives still holds the single game scoring record of 66 points, and in this game, he was guarded by Sumner Goldstein, who would later go on to become an attorney. http://www.hoopsanalyst.com/ncaa.htm Komives scored 66 points in one game, which is still a Bowling Green single game record. In this game, Komives was guarded by Sumner Goldstein, who would later go on to become an attorney.. Even though he no longer is the school's all-time leading scorer (his 1,834 total points is currently third), his 25.8 scoring average is still a Falcons record. Komives still holds the Bowling Green single game scoring record of sixty six points. In this game, he was guarded by Sumner Goldstein, who would later go on to become an attorney. He was inducted into the BGSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 1970. His son Shane was a four-year basketball letterman at the same school from 1993 to 1996. Professional career Komives was selected thirteenth overall in the second round by the New York Knicks in the 1964 NBA draft.1964 NBA Draft - Basketball-Reference.com. He was named to the All-Rookie Team in 1965, after starting in every regular-season match and averaging 12.2 points per game. After the Knicks acquired Dick Barnett prior to the 1965-66 season, Komives was shifted to point guard, a position with which he struggled, drawing the wrath of Knicks fans. The most productive campaign of his professional career was in 1967, when his averages per contest were 15.7 points and 6.2 assists. By the time Red Holzman became the Knicks' coach midway through the 1967‚Äì68 season, Komives was involved in a personal feud with Cazzie Russell that negatively affected the rest of the team. Russell was an ardent supporter of Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential election, while Komives worked for the Hubert Humphrey campaign.Kalinsky, George. The New York Knicks: The Official 50th Anniversary Celebration. New York: Macmillan, Inc., 1996. With the emergence of Walt Frazier as the starting point guard, Komives was traded along with Walt Bellamy to the Pistons for Dave DeBusschere on December 19, 1968. This was what Komives is most remembered for, but only because DeBusschere was the last major addition to the Knicks before it won its first NBA Championship in 1970. In 2007, Komives was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame. Komives died at University of Toledo Medical Center on March 22, 2009 at age 67.

The Triangle (, HaMeshulash; , al-Muthallath), formerly referred to as the Little Triangle, is a concentration of Israeli Arab towns and villages adjacent to the Green Line, located in the eastern Sharon plain among the Samarian foothills; this area is located within the easternmost boundaries of both the Central District and Haifa District. The Triangle is further divided into the \\"Northern Triangle\\" or Wadi Ara (around Kafr Qara, Ar'ara, Baqa al-Gharbiyye, Zemer and Umm al-Fahm) and the Southern Triangle (around Qalansawe, Tayibe, Kafr Qasim, Tira, Kafr Bara and Jaljulia). Umm al- Fahm and Tayibe are the social, cultural and economic centers for Arab residents of the region. The Triangle is a stronghold of the Islamic Movement in Israel and Raed Salah, the current leader of the movement's northern faction, is a former mayor of Umm al-Fahm. History and status Prior to the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and Israel's establishment and sovereignty over the Kafr Qasim, Jaljulia and Kafr Bara area, it was referred to as the \\"Little Triangle\\" to differentiate it from the larger \\"Triangle\\" region between Jenin, Tulkarm, and Nablus. The region was originally designated to fall under Jordanian jurisdiction, but while negotiating the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Israel insisted on having it within its side of the Green Line, due to military and strategic reasons. To achieve this, a territorial swap was negotiated, ceding the Israeli territory in the southern hills of Hebron in exchange for the Triangle villages in Wadi Ara.Yisrael Ya'akov Yuval, \\"Where is the Green Line\\", Two Thousand, Vol. 29, no. 971, 2005 The term was later expanded to include the entire area around Wadi Ara (the Northern Triangle of today) and the \\"Little\\" appendage quickly fell out of common use. Involuntary loss of citizenship The concept of stripping the citizens of the area of their citizenship of Israel has been mooted. Several Israeli politicians have suggested the Triangle should be transferred to a future Palestinian state in exchange for Israel retaining control over settlements in the West Bank. The idea is a major part of the Lieberman Plan put forward by Yisrael Beiteinu leader Avigdor Lieberman but is largely opposed by Israeli Arabs. It is also a key feature of the Trump peace plan. In a July 2000 survey conducted by Kul al-Arab among 1,000 residents of Umm al-Fahm, 83 percent of respondents opposed the idea of transferring their city to Palestinian jurisdiction.Kul Al-Arab (Nazareth, Israel), 28 July 2000, cited in archived at See also *Arab localities in Israel References Category:Arab localities in Israel Category:Geography of Haifa District Category:Geography of Central District (Israel) ","title":"Triangle (Israel)"},{"id":"10486268","text":"The Albatros C.V was a German military reconnaissance aircraft which saw service during World War I. Design and development The C.V was Albatros Flugzeugwerke's first revision of their B- and C-type reconnaissance aircraft since Ernst Heinkel left the firm for Hansa-Brandenburg. While retaining the same basic layout as the Heinkel-designed aircraft, the C.V featured considerably refined streamlining. The forward fuselage was skinned in sheet metal and a neat, rounded spinner covered the propeller boss. Power was provided by the new Mercedes D.IV, a geared eight-cylinder engine. Operational history The initial production version, designated C.V/16, suffered from heavy control forces and inadequate engine cooling. Albatros therefore produced the C.V/17 with a new lower wing, as well as balanced ailerons and elevators. The fuselage-mounted radiators were replaced by a single flush radiator in the upper wing. These changes improved both handling qualities and engine cooling, but the downfall of the C.V was the unreliable Mercedes D.IV engine, which suffered from chronic crankshaft failures. The C.V was therefore replaced in production by the Albatros C.VII.

The film deals with a young student played by Hao Lei who leaves her small hometown to study at the fictional \\"Beiqing University\\" (a homage to Peking University). There she meets a fellow student and begins an intense romantic relationship in the backdrop of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The film also follows the eventual disillusionment of these young idealists after the crackdown, as the years progress through the 1990s and into the 2000s (decade). The film is named after the Summer Palace located in Beijing. Summer Palace's sex scenes and political undertones made the film tinder for controversy in China, leading both the director, Lou Ye, and his producers into conflict with China's State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT). After screening Summer Palace in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival without government approval, the film was placed under a de facto ban in Mainland China, and its filmmakers officially censored.  Plot  Spanning several cities and over a decade, Summer Palace tells the story of Yu Hong (played by Hao Lei), a young woman from the border-city of Tumen, who is accepted to the fictional Beiqing University, a name that evokes either Peking University (\\"Beida\\") or Tsinghua University (\\"Qinghua\\"). While in school, Yu Hong meets Li Ti, her best friend (played by Hu Lingling), and Zhou Wei, her college boyfriend and the love of her life (played by Guo Xiaodong). The film is divided into two parts. The first begins in the late 1980s (subtitles inform the audience of the place and year at various points in the film), as Yu Hong enters the university. Lonely and isolated despite the cramped living conditions, Yu Hong eventually befriends another student, Li Ti, who introduces her to her boyfriend Ruo Gu (played by Zhang Xianmin), and Ruo Gu's friend Zhou Wei. Yu Hong and Zhou Wei embark upon a passionate but volatile love affair just as political forces are moving towards Tiananmen Square. Two events then bring the first half of the film to a close: First, Zhou Wei, incensed at the jealousy and emotional instability of his girlfriend, begins to have an affair with Li Ti; and second, the crackdown occurs on the students on Tiananmen Square and on the campus of Beida. During all of this, Yu Hong's old boyfriend Xiao Jun (played by Cui Jin) from Tumen arrives and the two of them leave, Yu Hong deciding that she will drop out from the university. The film then fast forwards several years, as Lou Ye intersperses the travels of his three main characters with news footage of the end of the Cold War, and the 1997 Hong Kong handover. Yu Hong has left Tumen again, first for Shenzhen, and then for the central China city of Wuhan, while Li Ti and Ruo Gu have moved to Berlin. Yu Hong is unable to forget Zhou Wei, and has empty affairs with a married man and a kind but quiet mailroom worker. The film follows her disaffection with society and her use of sex as a substitute for contentment. Eventually discovering that she is pregnant, Yu Hong gets an abortion and moves to Chongqing where she marries. Li Ti, Ruo Gu, and Zhou Wei, meanwhile, live a quiet life as expatriates in Berlin. While Li Ti and Zhou Wei still occasionally make love, the former quietly realizes that the latter does not love her. Though the three friends appear happy, when Zhou Wei plans to return home to China and settle in the city of Chongqing, Li Ti suddenly commits suicide. There he connects with former classmates who in turn point him to Yu Hong's email address. After more than ten years, Zhou Wei and Yu Hong at last reunite in the resort city of Beidaihe. While they embrace, they ask each other, \\"Now what?\\" When Yu Hong leaves, ostensibly to buy drinks, Zhou Wei understands that they can never be together and leaves as well. Cast *Hao Lei as Yu Hong ‚Äì the film's heroine, a young student at the fictional Beiqing University from the small town of Tumen, Jilin on the North Korean-Chinese border. Yu Hong is a willful young woman who desires to live life more intensely. Her love affair with the character of Zhou Wei serves as the basis of the film. *Guo Xiaodong as Zhou Wei ‚Äì Yu Hong's love interest, another student at the same university. Something of an intellectual, Zhou Wei is both deeply in love with Yu Hong and prone to infidelity. When the Tiananmen protests arrive, he like his fellow students join in the movement. *Hu Lingling as Li Ti ‚Äì Yu Hong's best friend and eventual rival. Li Ti, an English-language major at the same university, is the first to befriend the sullen, quiet Yu Hong. Though considered a cynic, she harbors a romantic side as well. *Zhang Xianmin as Ruo Gu ‚Äì Li Ti's boyfriend, a student studying abroad in Berlin. *Cui Lin as Xiao Jun ‚Äì Yu Hong's high school boyfriend from Tumen. *Bai Xueyun as Wang Bo ‚Äì Yu Hong's lover in Wuhan. *Chloe Maayan as Dong Dong Lou Ye picked Hao Lei from over 400 candidates because she was the only one who turned him down, fearing the sex scenes would hurt her love relationship. As Lou said later, \\"That was something Yu Hong would say, so I had to have her play (Yu).\\" The entire crew waited patiently for Hao to accept, for so long that the original choice for Zhou Wei, Liu Ye, had to abandon the project. Hao was very touched and agreed, but her relationship with actor Deng Chao did end as a result. „ÄäÈ¢êÂíåÂõ≠„ÄãÂ•≥‰∏ªËßíÈÉùËïæ‰∏ìËÆøÂÆûÂΩï „ÄäÊüîËΩØ„ÄãÁÉ≠Êºî ÈÉùËïæÔºöÊàë‰∏çËÄªÁ¨ëËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÈÄâÊã© Lou's 2012 film Mystery reunited him with Hao.

The film received its American debut in the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 10, 2006, and a limited theatrical release beginning on January 18, 2008 through distributor Palm Pictures. =Home media= Summer Palace was released on Region 2 DVD in France on January 28, 2008. The single disc edition includes the film in its original Mandarin with French subtitles, along with special features such as a making-of documentary, a featurette on censorship, Lou Ye's film notes, and cast and crew biographies. A Region 1 DVD was released in the United States on March 11, 2008 by Palm Pictures. Reception Summer Palace was screened at several international film festivals, most notably Cannes, where it was the only Asian film in competition. However, the Palme d'Or eventually went to the Irish film, The Wind That Shakes the Barley, directed by Ken Loach. Besides Cannes, Summer Palace was also screened at a handful of top-tier festivals including Toronto and Mill Valley. Critics were generally positive in reviews, citing the film's ambition and scope with the most common complaint being the film's excessive length at 140 minutes. Derek Elley of Variety claimed the film was \\"half an hour too long.\\" The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, also mentioned the \\"thirty minutes too long\\" complaint but stated that the film was nevertheless \\"a raw and unsettling new work.\\" The Guardian also found the film \\"over-long and meandering,\\" but also \\"stylish [and] atmospheric.\\" The New York Times gave a particularly glowing review for the film with film critic A. O. Scott writing that \\"...[despite] its 2-hour-20-minute length, 'Summer Palace' moves with the swiftness and syncopation of a pop song. Like Jean-Luc Godard in the 1960s, Mr. Lou favors breathless tracking shots and snappy jump cuts, and like Mr. Godard‚Äôs, his camera is magnetized by female beauty.\\" The film was released unrated in the United States. Several American film critics have described Summer Palace as one of the most sexually-explicit films in years; indeed David Denby of The New Yorker noted that he never seen so much lovemaking in an \\"aboveground\\" film, however, he also noted that these scenes are not pornographic, that is, never separated from emotion. Hong Kong feminist scholar Evelyn Wan argued that the ‚Äúexcessive sex scenes,‚Äù while disturbing, effectively convey the ‚Äúsense of unsettledness and bewilderment‚Äù of the main characters.Wan Pui Yin (Evelyn), ‚Äú(Re)capturing the 'Absent' Memory of the June 4th Incident: An analysis of Lou Ye‚Äôs Summer Palace (2006)‚Äù, M.A. Diss., Utrecht University, 2011, 51. =Ban= The film was in competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival but failed to garner any awards. Though Summer Palace was the only Asian film in competition for the Palme d'Or, Lou and his producers had not received approval from Chinese censors, thus instigating an official censure by the Chinese State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT). Ultimately, both Lou and his producer, Nai An, were forbidden by the Chinese Government to make any new films for five years. Besides the filmmakers, Summer Palace itself was de facto banned when SARFT refused to grant a certificate to distribute in the Mainland because the film was not up to the official standards for picture and sound quality.

Douai was driven from Texas in 1856 due to his published opposition of slavery, living out the rest of his life as a school operator in the New England city of Boston. Douai is remembered as one of the leading American Marxists of the 19th century as well as a pioneer of the Kindergarten movement in America. Biography =Early years= The public square of Altenburg, Thuringia as it appeared in 1839, when Douai was 20. Karl Daniel Adolph Douai was born February 22, 1819, in Altenburg, Thuringia in the Duchy of Saxon-Altenburg, the son of a school teacher.\\"Dr. Adolph Douai, the Gifted and Tireless Agitator Dead...,\\" Workmen's Advocate [New Haven, CT], vol. 4, no. 4 (January 28, 1888), pp. 1-2. The Douai family was of French extraction, having fled to Dresden after the fall of the French Revolution. The Douai family was poor and Adolph went to work at the age of 8. Nevertheless, as a boy he was well educated, graduating from the Altenburg Gymnasium and the University of Leipzig, where he studied philology and history.Marilyn M. Sibley, \\"Carl Daniel Adolph Douai,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State Historical Association, 2010. He worked variously in his boyhood years as a newsboy, as an assistant to his father in teaching peasant children, as a crocheter of home manufactured wollen shawls, among other small jobs. Douai was poorly nourished as a child and short of stature, standing just tall at age 19. While at university, Douai found the stipends insufficient and therefore sought to supplement his income by writing. In a short autobiography published at the time of his death, Douai claimed to have authored several novels and two theological papers during his undergraduate years. Following his graduation from the University of Leipzig, Douai sought admission to the University of Jena as a student of philosophy and pedagogy. He was denied admission, however, and was forced to enter the workforce to earn enough money to study as a paying student. Douai took a job as a private tutor in Russia as the most lucrative course of employment during this interval. As he sought to be married to Baroness Agnes von Beust and faced a 2-year deadline for obtaining permanent employment placed upon him by her family, Douai instead took and passed imperial examinations at the University of Dorpat, which entitled him to the title of Doctor and enabled his employment by the government of Russia. Douai married Baroness Agnes von Beust on September 26, 1843, in the city of K√∂nigsberg. Together they eventually had ten children. Douai was instrumental in establishing the Neue Braunfelser Zeitung in 1852, a German newspaper edited by Ferdinand Lindheimer. Life in Russia had a radicalizing impact upon Douai and after 5 years in the country he returned to his native Altenburg, convinced that a revolution for constitutional and democratic government was in the wings. There he bought a building and hired assistants and established a private preparatory school. With the coming of the Revolutions of 1848, Douai helped organize clubs for workers and students and took an active part in the political movement, sitting as a member of the revolutionary Landtag of Saxe-Altenberg. His political activity brought him to the attention of the government of Saxony, which arrested him and charged him with high treason and rioting in the summer of 1848. Douai prevailed on the charge of treason but was nevertheless sentenced to one year in prison on three of the counts against him, a result which forced him to close his school and disburse its property. =Texas years= Following his release from prison, Douai was pressured by the government to emigrate and did so. Douai came to the United States and made his new home in the country's new state of Texas in the German colony of New Braunfels.Glen E. Lich, The German Texans. San Antonio: University of Texas Institute of Texas Cultures, 1996; pg. 140. There he helped to raise funds to launch the Neue Braunfelser Zeitung in November 1852, a publication edited by his friend Ferdinand Lindheimer (1801-1879).Marjorie Cook, \\"New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung,\\" Handbook of Texas Online, Texas State HIstorical Society, 2010. Douai also attempted to establish another school, but the efforts of the free-thinker Douai were impeded by a local Catholic priest, who spoke out against the schoolmaster, prompting parents to withdraw their children from his school. Douai subsequently fell ill with cholera, resulting in the termination of the school. With his first business effort a failure, Douai moved to nearby San Antonio and turned his attention to newspaper work, launching a newspaper, the San Antonio Deutsche Zeitung (German News). In his paper's pages, Douai unflinchingly denounced slavery as an evil incompatible with democracy and urged its abolition. Douai advocated in favor of establishing a slavery free state in the territory of western Texas. These controversial positions in slave-state Texas resulted in widespread public antipathy and the loss of advertisers and lead to the necessary sale of his publication in 1856. =Northern years= Douai was the author of one of the first American international socialist pamphlets in the English language, the 1877 tract Better Times! With the American Civil War in the wind, Douai moved north to Boston, Massachusetts, where he began working as a private tutor, also teaching at a New England institute for the blind in South Boston. While in Boston, Douai established a German workingmen's club which in 1859 sponsored a three-classroom school featuring the first Kindergarten in America. In 1860, Douai became editor of the New York Demokrat, a position which he soon abandoned to assume the position of Principal of the Hoboken Academy. He taught there for six years, moving to New York City in 1866 to establish a new school of his own. This New York school lost its leased building as part of an expansion of Broadway in 1871, prompting Douai to move to Newark, New Jersey, to accept a post as principal of the Green Street School there. Douai remained in Newark in this position until 1876, at which time a new Board of Directors were elected who were opposed to him. After being removed from his position in Newark, Douai accepted an offer to start a new educational academy in Irvington, New Jersey, but no suitable building could be had to bring the project to fruition. This event essentially brought Douai's teaching career to a close. He was an early and prominent member of the Socialist Labor Party of America, the first Marxist political party in America, established as the \\"Workingmen's Party of the United States\\" in 1876.Douai was the author of Better Times! (1876), called by historians Frank Girard and Ben Perry \\"one of the [Workingmen's Party's] first pamphlets.\\" See: Frank Girard and Ben Perry, The Socialist Labor Party, 1876-1991: A Short History. Philadelphia: Livra Books, 1991; pg. 7. In the fall of 1877 there was a short-lived plan for Douai to serve as English-language translator of Das Kapital, the magnum opus of Karl Marx first published in 1867.Karl Marx to Friedrich Adolph Sorge, September 27, 1877, and October 16, 1877. Published in Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, Marx-Engels Collected Works: Volume 45. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1991; pp. 276-277; 282-283. In January 1878, the German-language socialist daily newspaper the New Yorker Volkszeitung (New York People's News) was established, and Douai began to write extensively for the publication. It was there that Douai gained his greatest public fame as a journalist and publicist. =Death and legacy= Adolph Douai died on January 21, 1888, in New York after having suffered chronic \\"throat trouble.\\" A public memorial was held January 23 at the Brooklyn Labor Lyceum.

Ray Raposa described the recording of the album as 'on some the interludes between tracks we had like seven people on them so that is half of the credits right there. But most of the tracks are Rafter [Roberts], Sufjan [Stevens] and I doing lots of overdubs'. The album features contributions by Chris Schlarb and Daniel Carter.  Critical acclaim  Brian Howe from pitchforkmedia.com described the album as ' stringing together disembodied fragments of gothic Americana with brief, freaky interludes', while Heather Pares finds the themes of 'war and friendship' expressed through 'sparkling nighttime laments'. David Bernard in popmatters.com found the album 'consistently captivating' while 'many tracks hum with electronics and crawl along at a codeine pace'. Grigsby of tinymixtapes.com praised Raposa's writing as '[his] strength might lie in melancholy pop songs, and at that, he might be peerless'. Matthew Ozga of prefixmag was less impressed calling the album 'a real snooze musically' while charactersing Raposa as a 'relentless obscurantist'.

By 1916, a road between Napavine and Cinebar was constructed on the current route of SR 508 and was signed in 1937 as (SSH 5K) after being extended to Morton. SSH 5K became SR 508 in 1968 and since then, a segment in Bear Canyon has been reconstructed twice between 2007 and 2009 and a bridge over the Tilton River was reconstructed in 2009. Route description SR 508 eastbound as Main Avenue in Morton near the intersection. SR 508 begins at a diamond interchange with (I-5) concurrent with (US 12) within Napavine city limits. From the interchange, the highway leaves Napavine and travels southeast through an intersection with the Jackson Highway, formerly , to bridge and parallel the South Fork of the Newaukum River, passing Onalaska and Alpha before unparalleling the river and continuing east to Cinebar. East of Cinebar, the roadway starts to parallel the Tilton River through Bear Canyon to Morton, where the road becomes Main Avenue and ends at , named Second Street. An estimated daily average of 5,000 motorists used the I-5 / US 12 / SR 508 interchange in 2007, making it the busiest section of the highway; the SR 7 intersection was the busiest section in 1970, with an estimated daily average of 3,200 motorists. History A road paralleling the current route of SR 508 first appeared on a map in 1916, extending from Napavine to Cinebar. By 1937, the road was extended east to Morton and signed as (SSH 5K) in the same year. SSH 5K ran from a branch of (PSH 5) in Morton west to east of Napavine. In 1964, a highway renumbering created SR 508 to replace SSH 5K. Between 1968 and 2008, SR 508 between the (I-5) concurrent with (US 12) interchange and Onalaska used Forest Road and the Jackson Highway to get to Onalaska, but the route was later realigned. In early November 2006, heavy rainfall at Bear Canyon, located east of Cinebar, resulted in erosion of a cliff on the highway that caused portions of the roadway to fall into the Tilton River. Construction of the repairs began April 23, 2007 and a limited opening happened on June 25. On July 27, the new road was opened, but during heavy snowfall between December 19 and 22, 2008 and the resulting floods in early January 2009, the area was washed out. On January 29, 2009, SR 508 was reopened through Bear Canyon. A bridge over the Tilton River west of Milton that was built in 1947 and three other bridges on the highway were classified as structurally deficient in 2008 and the Tilton River Bridge was partially closed in April 2009. The bridge, like Bear Canyon, was damaged during floods in January 2009 and reopened on June 11.

The winery is located on the Right Bank of France's Bordeaux wine region in the Gironde department, close to the town of Saint-√âmilion. The winery also produces a second wine named Chapelle d'Ausone. History Placed on the western edge of 11th century village Saint-√âmilion, with elevated vineyards facing south on steep terraces in ideal situation, Ausone takes its name from Decimius Magnus Ausonius (310‚Äì395 AD), a statesman and poet from Bordeaux who owned about of vineyard. It is believed by some that Ch√¢teau Ausone is on the foundations of his villa. The modern estate can be dated to the 18th century, when it was owned by Jean Cantenat. Later, under the ownership of the Lafargue family, the vineyard was inherited by Edouard Dubois who steered the ch√¢teau through the difficulties of the late 19th century, and in 1916 added the adjacent Ch√¢teau Belair to their estate. The chateaux were run separately, although both age their wine in the Ausone cellars, caves in the limestone cliffs beneath the town of Saint-√âmilion. After Dubois died in 1921, his widow Heylette Dubois-Challon and Dubois' children of a previous marriage who married into the Vauthier family took control over the estate. Ch√¢teau Ausone presentation card dated 1931, demonstrating the designs of the early 20th century, the label, cork, case and capsule markings. Ausone was one of a few estates which escaped the terrible frost of 1956, unlike its neighbour Cheval Blanc that lost several years' vintages. Other neighbours suffered the destruction of their vines. Despite being one of the great names of Bordeaux, Ausone fell into decline until Pascal Delbeck was appointed winemaker in 1976. For several years Ausone was jointly owned by the Dubois- Challon and Vauthier families. After an unsettling time, feuding in the courts was brought to an end when the Vauthiers bought the Dubois-Challon shares in the mid 1990s. Alain Vauthier became managing director of Ausone, while Heylette Dubois-Challon won the right to live in the chateau until her death in 2003. Michel Rolland was appointed consultant oenologist in 2002. Production The success of the wine produced at Ausone is attributed to a combination of exposure and the soil, a mixture of sand and clay on limestone unique to the district.

Nickum had the money to build the house as he had supplied the Union Army in Indianapolis with hardtack, a form of cracker despised by soldiers, during the Civil War. Nickum's daughter, Magdalena, and her husband Charles Holstein, a lawyer, would possess it when, in 1893, they invited noted poet James Whitcomb Riley to live with them. Riley had a bedroom on the second floor in this building for 23 years, helping the Holsteins with expenses.Conn, Earl L.

They helped build the career of Rihanna, and are the principals of her production company named SRP Music Group. As songwriters and record producers, Rogers and Sturken have achieved more than twenty top 40 hits, twelve top 5 hits and six BMI Awards. Their songs have sold more than 60 million albums around the world. History Sturken & Rogers started their careers in the New York R&B; scene of the mid-1980s. During that time, Rogers himself released a full-length solo album, 1985's Love Games for RCA Records (he would release a second album, Faces of Love for Capitol four years later), and the duo produced Gavin Christopher for EMI Manhattan Records, scoring their first big hit with Christopher's \\"One Step Closer to You.\\" They also worked on the legendary Beat Street soundtrack and began to gain a reputation by producing such artists as Cheryl Lynn, Stephanie Mills and Jennifer Holliday. They then crossed over to the pop world by engineering the comeback of Donny Osmond, writing and producing the #2 smash \\"Soldier of Love\\" and the Top 10 hit \\"Sacred Emotion\\". Following their success with Donny Osmond, they became artists themselves, forming an R&B; group called Rythm Syndicate with John Nevin, Rob Mingrino and Kevin Cloud, all of whom hailed from Connecticut. In 1991, the group scored a #2 hit on the US Billboard charts, \\"P.A.S.S.I.O.N.\\", as well as a Top 15 follow-up, \\"Hey Donna\\". In addition to providing vocals for the group, Rogers and Sturken wrote or co-wrote all of their songs. However, after two years of touring and promotion, along with two unsuccessful albums and a few less successful singles, Sturken and Rogers disbanded the group to resume writing and producing full-time. They wrote and/or produced six songs for Debbie Gibson's 1993 album Body Mind Soul including US single \\"Losin' Myself\\" and the UK single \\"Shock Your Mama\\". Success came next in the UK with the Top 5 single \\"Power of a Woman\\" for Eternal. More work overseas followed, including contributions to the Brand New Heavies' platinum album Shelter. For Irish boy band Boyzone, they wrote and produced four songs for the group's Where We Belong album, which entered at #1 on the UK charts. The six-time platinum album includes the Sturken & Rogers penned \\"All That I Need\\", which was a UK #1 single. The song also appears on Boyzone's Greatest Hits package, By Request, which spent over two months at #1 and also had sales of over six million units. In 1997, they shifted their attention back to the U.S. The hit \\"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\\", written and produced for NSYNC, was a Billboard Top 10 single, before climbing into the Billboard Country Top 5 after being covered by country recording legend Alabama. The song also received a Grammy nomination in 2000 for Best Country Collaboration by a group or duo. NSYNC's debut album sold over 10 million copies in the US alone. In addition to the pop and country versions of \\"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\\", the song was also recorded by jazz artist Kirk Whalum for his album Unconditional, which was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Performance at the 2002 Grammy Awards. Sturken & Rogers also wrote and produced several songs for Christina Aguilera‚Äôs debut album. The album entered the Billboard charts at #1 and went double platinum after only three weeks, eventually totaling sales in excess of 11 million worldwide. They also branched out into the jazz world working with Dave Koz on his album The Dance. The album contains two Sturken & Rogers penned songs, including \\"Can‚Äôt Let You Go\\", co-written with Koz and featuring Luther Vandross on vocals, which went on to become a #1 hit on the Smooth Jazz chart. The duo also had songs on 98 Degrees‚Äô double platinum album Revelation and the multi-platinum debut albums of Jessica Simpson, Alsou, Mandy Moore and Anastacia, as well as many other collaborations with such artists as Christina Milian and Emma Bunton. They also wrote sings with and for The Brand New Heavies Shelter LP notably Last To Know with Simon Bartholomew. As the 1990s came to a close and teen pop died down, Sturken & Rogers changed gears once again, discovering and developing Javier, whom they signed to Capitol Records. They wrote and produced the majority of his debut album, including the hit single \\"Crazy\\". Next to come calling was Clive Davis, who hired the team to work on Kelly Clarkson‚Äôs debut album, for which they wrote the hit single \\"The Trouble with Love Is\\", also featured in the movie Love Actually. The Davis connection continued with the American Idol project in 2004, as well as Rod Stewart‚Äôs As Time Goes By: the Great American Songbook 2 and two tracks for Ruben Studdard's double platinum debut album, Soulful. The duo then decided to begin developing artists in earnest, forming Syndicated Rhythm Productions in 2005. Their first signing was Rihanna, whom Rogers discovered while visiting family in Barbados. They brought her to Jay-Z and L.A. Reid at Def Jam Records and she was signed within hours of her audition. Rihanna‚Äôs first single \\"Pon De Replay\\", co-written and produced by Sturken & Rogers, went on to be a worldwide smash. Rihanna‚Äôs second album, A Girl Like Me, contained the hit singles \\"SOS\\" and \\"Unfaithful\\", and established her as an international star. In 2007 Rihanna scored one of the biggest singles of the year with \\"Umbrella\\" ; the follow up single \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" was written and produced by Sturken & Rogers, and became a top 10 hit worldwide, as well as being featured in the movies 21, I Love You Man, and Cars. Good Girl Gone Bad went on to be one of the best selling albums of that year, selling over 15 million copies worldwide to date. As of November 2013, Rihanna sold over 50 million albums and 180 million singles worldwide. The SRP artist roster continued to grow during this time; next up was Shontelle, who they brought to Steve Rifkind‚Äôs SRC/Universal Motown label, where they produced her debut album Shontelligence in 2008. Shontelle has joined fellow Barbadian Rihanna at the top of the charts with her first hit, \\"T-Shirt\\", which was a top 15 hit in the US, and was top 5 for a month in the U.K., where she has followed it with her second hit \\"Stuck with Each Other\\", a duet with Akon from the movie Confessions of a Shopaholic. Shontelle‚Äôs follow up album included the worldwide platinum smash \\"Impossible\\". Sturken and Rogers continued writing and producing for artists outside of their own stable with their song \\"Issues\\", they scored yet another top smash with British girl group The Saturdays. They also co-wrote the song \\"Gypsy\\" for Shakira, which was an international hit and won a Latin BMI award. The time had come for the next chapter of Sturken and Rogers' career, and thus the SRP Records label was formed in early 2009, in partnership with Universal/Motown. Their first signing was Vita Chambers who opened for Justin Bieber‚Äôs 2010 \\"My World\\" tour, and then scored a gold single in Canada with her single \\"Fix You\\". Singer/songwriter Taylor Berrett was discovered by SRP while still a high school student in Washington, DC. After signing a publishing deal with Kara DioGuardi‚Äôs Arthouse Music, Taylor inked a deal through SRP with Warner Bros. records, and recorded his debut album with producer Jake Gosling (Ed Sheeran, Christina Perri). Nashville born pianist/singer Kandace Springs was SRP‚Äôs next discovery; they signed her to Don Was at Blue Note/Capitol. In 2014 she performed her debut single \\"Love Got in the Way\\" on the Late Show with David Letterman, followed by a slew of other national television appearances, and performances at the Afropunk and Bonnaroo festivals, as well as performing with Prince at the \\"Purple Rain\\" 30th anniversary show at Paisley Park. Her upcoming debut album is being produced by Grammy legend Larry Klein. The newest signing to SRP is 20-year-old singer/flute prodigy Elena Pinderhughes; having already toured the world, played the White House, and performed with such giants as Herbie Hancock, she is now recording her debut album for release in 2016. Sturken and Rogers have also begun to build their own stable of writer/producers, forming a joint venture with Universal Music Publishing Group. Their first signing, Brandon Alexander, a.k.a. BAM, had his breakout with the Grammy nominated Tyrese smash \\"Stay\\" which spent 11 weeks at #1 on the Adult Urban chart. BAM was also nominated for a Grammy for the Chris Brown/Kendrick Lamar collaboration \\"Autumn Leaves\\", and he wrote and produced 9 of the 11 cuts on Tyrese's new album, which entered at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200 Albums chart. He is currently in the studio with Chris Brown, Trey Songz, and August Alsina. Most recently SRP paired two young writers, Jackson Foote and Emma Lov, to form the writing/production team Loote; they've already landed cuts on Natalie La Rose and are collaborating with a host of other major label artists.

In elections to the colonial Cochinchina Council a \\"United Workers and Peasants\\" slate, led by Ta Thu Thau of the now wholly Trotskyist La Lutte grouping, triumphed alike over the Communist Party's Democratic Front and the \\"bourgeois\\" Constitutionalists. As understood by Van, however, the partisans of the Fourth International succeeded at the ballot box for reasons relatively mundane. The election had been primarily a tax protest, a rejection of the new French Indochina defence levy that the Communist Party, in the spirit of Franco-Soviet accord, had felt obliged to support. Governor General Br√©vi√© indeed had praise for the defeated the Stalinists who, in contrast to the Trotskyists, \\"understood that the interests of the Annamese masses bring them closer to France.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 100. The political opening against the Communist Party, such as it was, closed with the Hitler-Stalin Pact of August 23, 1939. Moscow ordered a return to direct confrontation with the French. The Party obliged, triggering a peasant revolt in south to whose bloody suppression Ng√¥ VƒÉn, having been exiled to the Mekong Delta, was witness. The September 1945 Saigon Uprising Opportunity for open political struggle returned with the formal surrender of the occupying Japanese in August 1945. But events then moved rapidly to demonstrate the Trotskyists' relative isolation in Saigon. VƒÉn and his comrades had little intimacy with developments to the north where, in Hanoi, on September 2, 1945, H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The lack of connection was made \\"painfully clear\\" when they found they had \\"no way of finding out what was happening\\" following reports that in the Hongai-Camphai coal region north of Haiphong 30,000 workers (under the indifferent gaze of the defeated Japanese) had elected councils to run mines, public services and transport, and were applying the principle of equal pay.Manfred McDowell, \\"Sky without Lights: a Vietnamese Tragedy,\\" New Politics, Vol XIII, No. 3, 2011 (link below) (Months later they received a report that the \\"Democratic Republic\\" had‚Äîin the name of national unity‚Äîcrushed the commune). In Saigon itself, the initiative lay with the Communist-front Viet-Minh (supported, Ng√¥ VƒÉn records, by the leadership of the Jeunesse d'Avant-Garde/Thanh Nien Tienphong (Vanguard Youth, a \\"formidable\\" movement that had contributed to civil defence and policing under Japanese). Only when, for the declared purpose of disarming the Japanese, the Viet-Minh accommodated the landing and strategic positioning of British troops, did rival political forces turn out in force. The brutality of a French restoration, under the protection of British guns, triggered a general uprising. Under the slogan \\"Land to the Peasants! Factories to the workers!,\\" Ng√¥ VƒÉn and his comrades joined residents in popular councils and in a \\"Workers' Militia.\\" In the \\"internationalist spirit of the League,\\" streetcar workers had broken with their union, General Confederation of Labour (renamed by the Viet Minh \\"Workers for National Salvation\\"). Refusing the yellow star of the Viet-Minh, they mustered under the unadorned red flag \\"of their own class emancipation.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, 1945: The Saigon Commune, https://libcom.org/files/1945%20The%20Saigon%20commune.pdf Like other independent formations, these were soon caught in the crossfire as the Viet- Minh returned to engage the French. As Ng√¥ VƒÉn's Militia group fell back from the city, they reached out to local peasants: \\"we explained to them that we were fighting not only to 'drive out the French' but also [drawing the distinction with the Viet-Minh] to get rid of the indigenous landlords, to end the forced labour in the rice fields, and to liberate the coolies.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 132 But for a timely rescue, Ng√¥ VƒÉn, captured on reconnaissance, would likely have been executed by Viet-Minh alongside a surveyor (and La Lutte supporter) condemned for having helped peasants divide expropriated land. \\"Harassed by the S√ªret√© in the city and denied refuge in a countryside dominated by the two terrors, the French and the Viet-Minh,\\" and suffering from tuberculosis, in the spring of 1948 Ng√¥ VƒÉn took the decision to board a merchant ship bound for Marseilles. \\"New radical perspectives\\" from exile In France, Ng√¥ VƒÉn found \\"new allies in the factories and elsewhere, among French people, colonised people, and refugees from the Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939--anarchists and Poumistas [veterans of the POUM, The Workers' Party of Marxist Unification] who had gone through a parallel experience to ours.

Having split with the Trotskyist Parti Communist Internationale over their \\"defence of the USSR\\" as a \\"degenerated workers‚Äô state,\\" the UOI supported VƒÉn in taking issue with his exile community. \\"Despite the assassination of almost all their comrades in Vietnam by Ho Chi Minh's hired thugs,\\" the Vietnamese Trotskyists had adopted the slogan \\"Defend the government of Ho Chi Minh against the attacks of imperialism\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, p. 199 In \\"Prol√©taires et paysans, retournez vos fusils!\\" [Workers and Peasants, Turn Your Guns in the Other Direction!], an opinion piece appearing under the name Dong Vu in the Trotskyist paper Tieng Tho (Workers' Voice) (October 30, 1951), Ng√¥ VƒÉn argued that if Ho Chi Minh won out over the French-puppet B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i government, workers and peasants would simply have changed masters. Those with guns in their hands should fight for their own emancipation, following the example of the Russian workers, peasants and soldiers who formed soviets in 1917, or the German worker's and soldiers' councils of 1918-1919.Ng√¥ VƒÉn,In the Crossfire, p. 199 In 1952 Ng√¥ VƒÉn and his partner Sophie Moen joined a less formal group around the \\"marxologist\\" Maximilien Rubel. Rubel inspired a re-reading of Marx as a \\"theoretician of anarchism\\".Maximilien Rubel, \\"Marx, th√©oricien de l'anarchisme,\\" L'Europe en formation, no 163-164, 1973 He also introduced VƒÉn to other of Marx's contemporaries, such as Soren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, who had espoused \\"new sets of values, new reasons for living, new norms for acting, a new ethic.\\" VƒÉn recalled that Nietzsche had strongly influenced Nguyen An Ninh, the radical journalist and publicist whose celebrity had first awakened his own political consciousness in the late 1920s (and who, in a brief encounter in the Maison Centrale',' had shared with VƒÉn C√©line's \\"explosive\\" Voyage au bout de la nuit [Journey to the End of the Night]).Ng√¥ VƒÉn,In the Crossfire, pp. 79-80 In 1958 Ng√¥ VƒÉn's study and discussion circle‚Äîwhich later adopted the name Council Communist Group‚Äîbegan to cooperate closely with the Henri Simon in the ICO (Informations et correspondances ouvri√®res). The project sought to bring together workers in different companies who \\"no longer had any confidence in the traditional working-class organisations.\\" A distinct nucleus, Regroupement Interenterprises, was set up, and VƒÉn was one of those involved. The meetings organised were small, usually between 10 and 20, but they slowly began to grow in the run-up to 1968.Nick Heath, Xuyet, Ngo Van, 1912-2005, Libcom.org (link below) Paris, May 1968 In a wave of such labour actions across France, in May 1968 Ng√¥ VƒÉn joined in the occupation of his workplace, the Jeumont-Schneider factory in electrical engineering plant in Paris. From the outset he noted that CGT (Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail) union officials (who formed the factory's Communist Party cell) sought to keep the workers isolated within the factory. They turned away students and other curious visitors. When the officials insisted that the red flag workers had mounted on the gate be paired with the tricolour, Van took it as a signal that he would, again, be witness to a sacrifice of class interests to national party-political ambition. It was a concern he believed was borne out by the unions' acceptance of relatively minor concessions in the national Grenelle Agreements. VƒÉn acknowledges, however, that in his factory the discussion of more radical demands was desultory at best. Worker self- management was mentioned but his colleagues \\"thought themselves incapable of carrying out such a task effectively.\\" The nature of the modern economy was such that democratic management presented \\"a worldwide problem,\\" not something they believed \\"could not be carried out within an individual factory, or even within a single country.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, pp. 207-216 In general \\"the workers had little to say.\\"libcom.org \\"Impressions of May 1968--Ngo Van' (link below) Writing and Reflections Ng√¥ VƒÉn retired in 1978. He devoted his remaining years to researching and relaying the history of popular struggle in Vietnam, reflecting upon his own experience, and memorialising his fallen friends and comrades. He covered the years of his own engagement both in a substantial history, Vi·ªát Nam 1920-1945, r√©volution et contre-r√©volution sous la domination coloniale [Vietanm 1920-1945, Revolution and Counterrevolution under Colonial Domination] (1996), and in a personal memoir, Au pays de la cloche f√™l√©e : Tribulations d'un cochinchinois √† l'√©poque coloniale [In the Land of the Cracked Bell: Tribulations of a south Vietnamese in the Colonial Era] (2000). Together with notes for a second autobiographical volume, this is published in English as In the Crossfire: Adventures of a Vietnamese Revolutionary (2010). Le joueur de flute et l'oncle Ho - Vietnam 1945-2005 [The Flute Player and Uncle Ho: Vietnam 1945‚Äì2005] (2005) covers the decades since his exile. It is the story of the Communist Party's consolidation of power in \\"the long war\\" (\\"The victory of the 'heroic little people'‚Äîwhat victory?\\") and, with reference to strikes and other signs of revolt, of the opening of the new economy to foreign capital. Ng√¥ VƒÉn's last completed work, written in 2004 when he was 91 years old, was an introduction to the history of peasant revolts in China, with special emphasis on their Taoist origins and utopian and libertarian inspirations.Ng√¥ VƒÉn, Utopie antique et guerre des paysans en Chine, Gex-la-Vill, 2004 With H√©l√®ne Fleury he also brought out a collection of Vietnamese folk tales for children.Ng√¥ VƒÉn and H√©l√®ne Fleury, Contes d'autrefois du Vi√™t nam: Chuy√™n doi xua xu Vi√™t, Paris, 2001. In 1998 for the first time since 1948, Ng√¥ VƒÉn was able to visit his homeland. But for all the evidence he would have witnessed of a preceding half century of social and economic change, the now Socialist Republic of Vietnam remained for Ng√¥ VƒÉn, first and foremost, a society in which producers \\"still do not enjoy collective ownership of the means of production, nor [have] time for reflection, nor the possibility of making their own decisions, nor means of expression.\\" Asked why he so \\"stubbornly\\" persisted in bearing witness to past history, VƒÉn replied \\"Because the world hasn't changed.\\"Ng√¥ VƒÉn, In the Crossfire, pp. xvii-xviii Published works * 1937--V·ª• √°n Moscow, nh√† xu·∫•t b·∫£n Ch·ªëng Tr√†o L∆∞u, Saigon, (pamphlet in Vietnamese denouncing the Moscow Trials) * 1976--Divination, magie et politique dans la Chine ancienne [Divination, magic and politics in ancient China] (Paris, PUF, 1976) * 1995--Revolutionaries They Could Not Break (London, Index Books) * 1996--Vi√™t-nam 1920-1945, r√©volution et contre-r√©volution sous la domination coloniale (Paris, L‚Äôinsomniaque; Nautilus, 2000) * 1997--Une amiti√©, une lutte, 1954-1996.

She was inducted into the National Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2001 for her years spent as a player, coach, administrator, and official of women's basketball. She was the first woman ever elected President of the National Association for Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) basketball association. Early career Holmes graduated from Greenville College in 1961. She played basketball there as an undergrad for the Lady Panthers. She holds the single season scoring average record for Greenville with 20 points scored per game in the 1959-60 season. Before eventually returning to her alma mater to coach, Holmes coached the women's basketball team at Biola University from 1964 to 1967. At Greenville College, Holmes gained much respect for her coaching ability, eventually coaching for over 25 years before becoming athletic director at GC while also serving as NAIA president. In coaching over 500 games, she won more than 300. International basketball Holmes accepted many positions in international women's basketball, beginning with the position of assistant coach at the Olympic Festival in Moscow in 1978, earning a bronze medal. Holmes served as assistant coach for the women's USA Basketball team prior to the 1980 Olympics. To evaluate prospective players for the 1980 Games, Holmes and head coach Carole Baumgarten of Drake University took part in the 1979 Spartakiade in the Soviet Union. Held every four years since the '50s, Spartakiade was seen as a preview to the Olympic Games each year. That year's team included Ann Meyers and Lynette Woodard. In international competition, Holmes also served as the manager for the 1981 Women's World University Games held in Bucharest, Romania under head coach Kay Yow of North Carolina State University. The US women earned the silver medal behind the Soviets. She served as manager for the 1983 US women's team for the world championships in Sao Paulo, Brazil, serving under head coach Pat Summitt of the University of Tennessee. The 9th Women's World Championship was held July 4 to August 6, 1983 in S√£o Paulo. The women's team that year came within one basket of defeating the Soviet Union and retaining their seventh world championship in a row. The team finished 6-2 and brought home a silver medal. The game between the Soviets and Americans was the first time the teams had met head-to-head in international competition since the 1976 Olympics. Among the legendary players on the US team was Cheryl Miller and Lynette Woodard. In addition to serving as manager for the world championships that year, Holmes went as manager for the USA Women's Pan Am Games, held August 14‚Äì27, 1983. The head coach for the Pan Am Games was Fran Garmon of Texas Christian University, and they were held in Caracas, Venezuela. With Garmon at the top and Kay Yow as assistant coach, Holmes remained along with the rest of the players from the World Championships a few weeks earlier. This time, the US came out on top against Cuba. NAIA presidency In 1989, in a milestone for women in sports, Holmes was the first woman elected as president of the NAIA. In addition to being the first woman to hold that particular position, her election marked the first time a woman had governed a national body of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs intercollegiate athletics. In her time as President, Holmes coordinated the first NAIA women's basketball championship and began to plan a national tournament that would expand from eight to 32 competing teams. She also helped to create the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame that would eventually induct her. Holmes left after one year as NAIA President to serve as the new Hall of Fame's first Executive Director. 1996 world championship Honors Holmes was inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame June 8‚Äì9, 2000 for her achievements at GC and on the international basketball stage.

She was possibly the sister of her husband. She accompanied her husband while he went to war. It was because of this that she was captured by Alexander the Great after the Battle of Issus, in 333 BC at the town of Issus.A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, Vol III, edited by William Smith, 1872 p.901 Her husband abandoned his entire family at the site as he fled from Alexander, including his mother Sisygambis and his daughters Stateira II and Drypetis. Alexander is reported to have treated them with great respect.Quintus Curtius Rufus, Historiae Alexandri Magni Macedonis, 3.12.17. Stateira I died giving birth around 332 BC. Some rumors speculated the father of the child might not have been Darius but Alexander the Great. Darius' mother Sisygambis had a lifelong respect and genuine friendship with Alexander. In 324 BC, her daughter, Stateira II, married Alexander, and her other daughter, Drypetis, married one of his lifetime companions, Hephaestion. When Alexander died one year later these royal Persian women mourned his death, further indicating personal relationships rather than merely diplomatic ones. Both of her daughters and their families were assassinated by another wife of Alexander, Roxana, who sought to remove any competition and assure that her son would succeed him. Upon hearing the news of Alexander's death, Sisygambis said farewell to her family, turned to the wall, and fasted herself to death.

After her father's defeat at the Battle of Issus, Stateira and her sisters became captives of Alexander of Macedon. They were treated well, and she became Alexander's second wife at the Susa weddings in 324 BC. At the same ceremony Alexander also married her cousin, Parysatis, daughter of Darius' predecessor. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Stateira was killed by Roxana, his first wife. Name Scholars have debated her name. In his list of marriages that occurred at Susa, Arrian (c. 86 - after 146), calls her \\"Barsine\\". She is commonly confused with another Barsine who was also held captive by Alexander around the same period. Historian William Woodthorpe Tarn asserts her official name was \\"Barsine\\", but she was likely commonly called \\"Stateira\\".Tarn (2002), p. 334. Tarn cites other instances of confusion, noting that by the end of the 3rd century BC, legend often confused Roxane with Stateira as the daughter of Darius.Tarn (2002), p. 335. Early life Stateira was the eldest daughter of Darius III of Persia and his wife, also named Stateira. Both of her parents were frequently described as handsome or beautiful, leading Tarn to speculate Stateira \\"was sufficiently good-looking, at any rate for a princess, to be called ... beautiful.\\"Tarn (2002), p. 336. Her birthdate is unknown; by 333 BC she was of marriageable age.Carney (2000), p. 108. After Alexander the Great invaded Persia, Stateira and her family accompanied Darius' army. In November 333 Alexander's army defeated the Persians at the Battle of Issus. Darius fled, and the Macedonian army soon captured his family. Although many captured Persian women were treated brutally, under Alexander's orders Stateira, her mother, her sister Drypetis, her younger brother, and their paternal grandmother, Sisygambis, were treated well and allowed to retain their social status. Marriage to Alexander the Great For the next two years, Stateira and her family followed Alexander's army. Her mother died at some point between 333 and 331, leaving Sisygambis to act as her guardian. Although Darius tried several times to ransom his family, Alexander refused to return the women. Darius then offered Alexander Stateira's hand in marriage and agreed to relinquish his claim to some of the land Alexander had already seized in exchange for ending the war. Alexander declined the offer,Carney (2000), p. 109. reminding Darius that he already had custody of both the land and Stateira, and that if he chose to marry her Darius' permission would not be necessary. In 330 BC, Alexander left Stateira and her family in Susa with instructions that she should be taught Greek. Historian Elizabeth Donnelly Carney speculates that Alexander had already decided to marry Stateira and was preparing her for life as his wife. Stateira became Alexander's second wife in 324 BC, almost ten years after her capture, in a mass ceremony known as The Susa weddings which lasted five days. Ninety other Persian noblewomen were married to Macedonian soldiers who were loyal to Alexander; this included Drypetis, who married Alexander's friend, Hephaestion.O'Brien (2005), p. 197. At the same ceremony, Alexander married Parysatis, daughter of previous Persian ruler Artaxerxes III. It was fairly common practice for conquering rulers to marry the widow or daughter of the man they had deposed. By wedding both women, Alexander cemented his ties to both branches of the royal family of the Achaemenid Empire. Alexander died the following year, 323 BC. After his death, his first wife Roxana colluded with Perdiccas to kill Stateira. Roxana wished to cement her own position and that of her son, Alexander IV, by ridding herself of a rival who could be‚Äîor claim to be‚Äîpregnant.Carney (2000), p. 110. According to Plutarch's account, Stateira's sister, Drypetis, was killed at the same time; Carney believes that Plutarch was mistaken, and it was actually Parysatis who died with Stateira. Depictions A mural in Pompeii, depicting Alexander and Stateira Stateira may be depicted in a fresco found during the excavations at Pompeii. The fresco depicts a nude warrior in a purple Macedonian cloak, likely Alexander. On his left stands a woman wearing a crown and holding a scepter.

Besides the St. Marx Cemetery it is the last remaining cemetery of Vienna in the Biedermeier style. After its closure in the 1880s, it was partially destroyed during the time of the Third Reich, and is now only partly accessible due to its deteriorating condition. A long-running debate over the restoration of the cemetery has been taking place since 2006 between politicians of the federal and local levels as well as experts.  Location  Originally the cemetery was part of the Viennese suburb of W√§hring. Today, however, due to boundary changes, the cemetery, despite its name, is no longer part of the 18th Vienna district of W√§hring, but belongs to D√∂bling, the 19th district. The entry is at No 3 Schrottenbachgasse.  History  The cemetery in W√§hring as seen from W√§hring Park Tombstone in the shape of a rootstock A stele Due to the sanitation ordinance of the Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, every graveyard in Vienna within the city walls had to be closed. In place of the old local graveyards that had developed around the parish churches, new graveyards were constructed outside the city walls. The Jewish community was also affected by this measure, as they maintained a cemetery in the Seegasse (Ro√üau). This cemetery was closed. For this reason, in 1784 the Jewish community acquired a 2-hectare plot of land next to the newly constructed General Cemetery of W√§hring; there, in the same year, they opened the new Jewish cemetery, demarcated by a wall. Originally, the cemetery consisted only of the part to the west of the entrance; however, it was twice expanded towards the east through the purchase of more land. Until the completion of the Jewish part of the Zentralfriedhof in 1879 approximately 8000 to 9000 graves were constructed here. Unlike at the Jewish cemetery in Ro√üau, where only Hebrew inscriptions may be found, in the W√§hring cemetery gravestones with Hebrew as well as German writing exist. A last few, occasional burials took place in the family vaults in the late 1880s. After that, no more burials took place at the cemetery. Around 1900 an avenue of lime trees was planted in the middle of the unused cemetery. This is a sign of how liberal the Jewish community in Vienna at the time was, as lime trees planted next to priests' graves are supposed to dissolve the separation between these graves and the surrounding graves in the traditional Jewish mindset. The neighbouring General W√§hring Cemetery (Allgemeiner W√§hringer Friedhof) was broken up in the 1920s and turned into the W√§hringerpark. The Jewish Cemetery, on the other hand, was left standing due to the Jewish laws regarding consecrated ground. In the Nazi period, a substantial portion of the cemetery was however destroyed. Approximately 1,500‚Äì2,000 graves were destroyed through excavation work for a fire protection pond that was never constructed. The congregation exhumed the affected graves so far as possible beforehand, and transported the remains to the Zentralfriedhof after the large-scale organising of trucks and fuel, where they were buried in a mass grave. The excavation material for the pond was used for building work at the Urban-Loritz-Platz. The remains of a further 200 dead were brought to the Naturhistorisches Museum of Vienna by the Nazis for analysis and research in the field of \\"racial studies\\". The remains were later likewise interred at the Zentralfriedhof. In 1942 there followed the expropriation of the whole plot of land; the Jewish community was forced to sell the cemetery to the city. After the premises of the cemetery were declared a bird sanctuary by a courageous city civil servant, at least the remaining land could be preserved. After World War II the cemetery was returned to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde after tough negotiations, but the destroyed part had to be given to the city in exchange. Thereupon, the city decided to develop the plot of land that had been cheaply acquired as grassland; it then constructed the \\"Arthur Schnitzler-Hof\\", a Plattenbau from the 1960s. Meanwhile, the rapid deterioration of the cemetery began, as the Jewish Kultusgemeinde could not afford to preserve it. Even after the Republic of Austria obliged itself in 2001, in the Washington Agreement, to render assistance for the preservation and restoration of Jewish cemeteries, no steps were taken towards the preservation of this cemetery. The Republic of Austria's payments to the Jewish Kultusgemeinde for the upkeep of Jewish cemeteries are used for the preservation of the two Jewish sections of the Zentralfriedhof, and as such, there are hardly any funds available for the maintenance of the Jewish Cemetery in W√§hring. Even after the declaration by the Vienna Restitution Commissioner Kurt Scholz that usage of the site as a park would be enabled, only a few rotten trees were felled. Following calls by the Vienna Greens for a clean-up of the cemetery, at the end of February 2006 the city councillor responsible for city finances at the time, Sepp Rieder (Social Democratic Party), suggested as a solution a foundation, in which the federation, the city and private donors would have a stake. However, in June 2006 the mayor, Michael H√§upl, called on the federal government to pay for the repairs, describing any possible contribution on the part of the states as a \\"voluntary contribution\\" at most. Concrete steps were therefore not taken. As no further maintenance of the tree population was undertaken, further gravestones were destroyed through wind damage (see Kyrill (storm)). In early 2007, the Jewish Kultusgemeinde estimated the cost of repairing the cemetery at 14 million euros and planned to turn the caretaker's house into a meeting house. In January 2007, along with the Educult institute, the Jewish Kultusgemeinde started an initiative that envisaged the publishing of a book and a photo calendar, as well as an exhibition, that would contribute to restoring the property. In addition, the until then irregular guided tours of the cemetery are now offered on a monthly basis. On 2 March 2007, the Social Democratic Party (SP√ñ) and the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP) finally agreed to a proposal by the Greens in the city council, that the \\"worst dangers and damages\\" on the cemetery should be cleared by the city of Vienna through the city's horticultural agency. To be able to restore and preserve the property long-term, however, the city of Vienna is relying heavily on the federation participating. The President of the National Council, Barbara Prammer, with a working group of representatives of the federation, federal states and local authorities, is planning the formulation of an all-Austrian solution. Cemetery composition and graves =Layout= If one enters the cemetery via the gate in the Schrottenbachgasse, to the left of the entrance just by the road one will find the building formerly used for the preparation of the deceased's body according to Jewish rites (see Tumah and taharah). It is an example of neoclassical architecture, built by Joseph Kornh√§usel. The side facing the street has been bricked up, but for the most part the building is still well-preserved. The older part of the cemetery is to the left of the entrance; the avenue of lime trees separates this older part from the newer part that was acquired later. The older part contains the graves of historically relevant people such as Fanny von Arnstein and the Epstein family. The Sephardic section is located on both sides of the main avenue in the northern area. Along the main avenue itself are the priests' graves (Kohanim). In the newer portion of the cemetery, predominantly people from poorer backgrounds were buried; due to the cheaper materials these gravestones are made of, they have been much more severely affected by erosion. There is also a section here in which infants were buried, as well as mothers who died in childbirth. The family vaults of ennobled Jews, on the other hand, are located along the cemetery wall in the northern part. =Sephardic section= Tomb in the Sephardic section In the 18th century Jews were in principle not allowed to reside in Vienna. However, the Sephardic Jews from the Ottoman Empire were an exception, who were allowed to reside there as Ottoman subjects under the Treaty of Passarowitz. Through the Sephardics, Vienna developed into an important centre of the oriental trade between the Ottoman Empire and the Sephardic communities of Amsterdam, Hamburg or Copenhagen. The relation of the Sephardic Jews with the Ottoman Empire is reflected in the tombs in the Jewish Cemetery in W√§hring. Alongside the oriental architecture and ornaments of the graves, the mausolea in particular have a significance that is unique for Central Europe. =Tombs of important figures=  von Arnstein family  Baroness Fanny von Arnstein (1758‚Äì1818), the daughter of the Berlin rabbi and Court Jew Daniel Itzig. She married into a rich Viennese family of Court Jews. Fanny von Arnstein's husband, Nathan Adam Freiherr von Arnstein (1748‚Äì1838), also lies buried in the Jewish Cemetery. Her husband was a banker, wholesaler and diplomat who succeeded in obtaining the suspension of the residence restrictions on Jews. The remains of Fanny von Arnstein were excavated by the Nazis and transferred to the Naturhistorisches Museum of Vienna for \\"scientific purposes\\", a fate that also befell several other graves. After that, the trail runs cold. To the present day, the Naturhistorisches Museum refuses to determine the location of the remains to return them to the cemetery.  Epstein-Teixeira de Matto family  In the tomb of the Epstein family lie the relatives of the businessman Gustav Ritter von Epstein (1827‚Äì1879). Gustav Ritter von Epstein was an important banker, who was connected amongst other things to the construction of the Northern Railway. In 1870 he constructed the Palais Epstein on the Ringstra√üe, but lost it in the stock market crash of 1873. He himself was not buried in this family tomb, but instead in the Jewish section of the Zentralfriedhof that was constructed 1877-1879.  Siegfried Philipp Wertheimber  The tomb of the well-known \\"tolerated\\" Jew Siegfried Philipp Wertheimber (1777‚Äì1836) is an important grave with pillars in the Egyptian style. Tolerated Jews were those Jews who were allowed to reside in Vienna through special permits. These special permits were made possible by the Edict of Tolerance of Joseph II. If a Jew had received such a special residence permit, many others in their household, if declared family members, could receive permission to live in Vienna. Households of tolerated Jews thus consisted of up to 200 people.  K√∂nigswarter family  Tomb of the K√∂nigswarter family The K√∂nigswarter family tomb contains the remains of the family of Jonas Freiherr von K√∂nigswarter (1807‚Äì1871). As a tolerated Jew, K√∂nigswarter bore the official title of \\"imperially-royally privileged\\" wholesale trader. K√∂nigswarter was a banker and president of the Vienna Kultusgemeinde. His wife Josefine (1811‚Äì1861) presided over the Jewish women's association.  Others  *Baron Bernhard von Eskeles (1753‚Äì1839), banker *Isaak L√∂w Hofmann, Edler von Hofmannsthal (1759‚Äì1849), merchant *Salomon Hermann Mosenthal (1821‚Äì1877), dramatist  State of preservation  Damaged tombs of the Arnstein und Eskeles families (2006) Since almost all the relatives of those who lie buried in the cemetery were killed in the Holocaust or had to emigrate, there is no- one left who can tend to the graves. Due to its limited funds, the Jewish Kultusgemeinde is also unable to contribute significantly to the preservation. Since no or hardly any resources have been made available for its upkeep by the city of Vienna and the Austrian government, the cemetery is in a state of extreme disrepair. Due to the overaged tree population and burial vaults partly standing open, visiting the cemetery is currently only possible after signing a liability waiver with the Kultusgemeinde. The president of the Jewish Kultusgemeinde, Ariel Muzicant, and Scholz, the commissioner for restitution, calculated the costs of providing safe access to the cemetery at ‚Ç¨ 400 - 800,000. Apart from the trimming of the older trees, hardly any preservation measures have been taken in recent years. Parts of the cemetery have become inaccessible due to the strong growth of bushes and small trees. In addition, the growth of the roots from the trees has dislocated gravestones, some of which have fallen over. Gravestones continue to be damaged by falling trees or falling rotten branches. Additional severe damage appears on the graves from environmental factors such as acid rain, frost and vegetation. Extreme-rightwing smearings have also damaged gravestones, which was particularly destructive to sandstone surfaces. Due to this, the enclosure walls of the cemetery were secured by the Kultusgemeinde with barbed wire and embedded broken glass.

They were produced by the Piccard-Pictet Company (whence its name derives) until 1920, and by Gnome et Rh√¥ne from 1920 until the demise of the marque in 1924. History In the early 1900s, two brothers, Charles and Frederic Dufaux set about building their own race car. The design called for a straight-8 12-litre engine with about 80 horsepower. To produce the automotive vehicle, the two brothers contacted the Piccard-Pictet Company, which had the capability to manufacture such a vehicle. The elderly Paul Piccard did not think highly of the relatively new invention of the automotive vehicle. On the other hand, Lucien Pictet believed that cars had a bright future. This friction led to the founding of the Genevan Automotive Vehicle Society (G.A.V.S.) in 1905. This was a marketing company which contracted the Piccard- Pictet Company to manufacture automotive vehicles. In fact, the cars were known as S.A.G.s until 1910. Lucien Pictet was appointed managing director. L√©on Dufour was appointed chief designer and later added technical director to his job titles. Pictet travelled to Barcelona in early 1905, and while there met with fellow Swiss Marc Birkigt of Hispano-Suiza. Pictet was so enamoured of the Hispano-Suizas that he negotiated a licence agreement in August 1905. At the second annual International Geneva Motor Show in 1906, Piccard- Pictet/S.A.G. displayed a 20/24 horsepower licensed Hispano-Suiza. In 1907, a 6-cylinder 28/32 horsepower car was introduced. In 1910, a 14/16 horsepower 2.4-litre 4-cylinder car was added. During World War I, the Swiss Army ordered a large number of Pic-Pics, which were known for their robustness. Indeed, these cars were in use until the late 1930s. The two post-war models used either a 2.9-litre 4-cylinder or a 5.9-litre V8. Sales of the cars declined after the war due to competition from imported brands. This led Piccard-Pictet Company to file for bankruptcy in 1920. Henceforth, Gnome et Rh√¥ne produced Pic-Pic cars, the last one being presented at the 1924 International Geneva Motor Show. In 1916, Commandant Yves le Prieur used a Pic-Pic to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Le Prieur rocket. The Pic-Pic's ability to travel up to 128.74752 kilometres per hour simulated the velocity of the aircraft at the time. The successful test led to the use of LePrieur's rockets on Nieuport fighter aircraft against German balloon aircraft. Motorsport Pic-Pics competed in a number of motorsports within their short existence. Two Pic-Pics with 4.5-litre engines and front-wheel brakes competed in the 1914 Grand Prix, but both cars were withdrawn. In hillclimbing events, Pic-Pics competed more successfully. Pic-Pic cars came first in Vosges in 1909, in Bern in 1911, and in Jaunpass in 1912, 1913, and 1914.

It is soluble, i.e. completely intracellular. Most notably, this enzyme is involved in vasodilation. In humans, it is encoded by the genes GUCY1A2, GUCY1A3, GUCY1B2 and GUCY1B3. It is classified under EC number 4.6.1.2.  Structure  sGC is a heterodimer composed of one alpha (1, 2) and one heme- binding beta (1, 2) subunits. Each subunit consists of four domains: an N-terminal HNOX domain, a PAS-like domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The mammalian enzyme contains one heme per dimer, with a proximal histidine ligand located in the HNOX domain of the beta 1 subunit. In its Fe(II) form, this heme moiety is the target of nitric oxide, which is synthesized by endothelial cells following appropriate stimulation. Binding of nitric oxide to the heme results in activation of the C-terminal catalytic domain, which produces cGMP from GTP. The HNOX (Heme Nitric oxide/OXygen binding) domain of the beta subunit of sGC contains the prosthetic heme group, and is part of a family of related sensor proteins found throughout a wide range of organisms. The HNOX domain uses the bound heme to sense gaseous ligands such as nitric oxide, oxygen, and/or possibly carbon monoxide. While the HNOX domain of sGC has no available structure, several bacterial HNOX domains have been crystallized (pdb codes 1U55, 1XBN, 2O09 and others). sGC also contains a PAS type regulatory domain. Named after the first three proteins in which it was found (Period clock protein, ARNT protein, and Single minded protein) the PAS domain is a sensor domain that has been found in a large variety of proteins, and can work in conjunction with a variety of prosthetic groups as a sensor for a variety of conditions, including light, oxidative stress, or diatomic gases. In the case of sGC, the PAS domain mediates heterodimer formation and may play a role in signal propagation from the HNOX domain to the catalytic guanylate cyclase domain. While the PAS domain of sGC has no available structure, the PAS domain of a protein with high sequence homology to sGC has been crystallized (pdb code 2P04). The PAS domain of sGC is followed by an extended coiled-coil region, which contains a segment called a Signaling helix, which is found in a variety of signaling proteins. The crystal structure of the coiled-coil region of the sGC beta subunit has been determined (pdb code 3HLS). The 250-residue guanylate cyclase domain at the C-terminus of sGC is highly conserved in soluble and membrane bound guanylyl cyclases, and shares significant homology with the catalytic domains of many adenylyl cyclases. In 2008, the first structures of a bacterial guanylate cyclase domain (pdb code 2W01) and a sGC guanylate cyclase catalytic domain (pdb code 3ET6) were reported. In late 2009, the crystal structure of a human guanylate cyclase catalytic domain, that of the beta subunit, was reported (pdb code 2WZ1). The complete structure of the assembled domains of sGC remains to be determined. Regulation NO leads to at least 200 fold increase in sGC activity. Because nitric oxide has a partially filled pi* orbital, back bonding prefers a bent geometry for the heme-NO complex. NO has a strong trans effect, in which the histidine-iron bond is weakened when NO binding delocalizes electrons to the dz2 orbital toward the axial ligand. Thus nitric oxide binding ferrous heme at the distal position gives a His-Fe-NO complex that dissociates to a 5-coordinate Fe-NO complex. However, the identification of two distinct [NO] dependent processes in sGC activation has led to speculation that a proximal NO is responsible for histidine displacement, giving an intermediate 6-coordinate NO-Fe-NO complex. Depending on product concentration, the intermediate can then dissociate either to one of two 5-coordinate forms, the more active distally NO ligated form, or the less active proximally NO ligated form. An alternative hypothesis states that a second, non-heme binding site accounts for the second NO dependent activation process to give the fully active enzyme. Under conditions of oxidative stress, Fe(II)sGC can be oxidized and lose its heme. Heme-free (apo-sGC) no longer responds to NO, but does respond to so-called sGC activator compounds. The latter bind to the empty heme pocket and activate the enzyme in a similar manner to the activation of Fe(II)sGC by NO. In addition, sGC contains an allosteric site, to which sGC stimulators bind. They potentiate NO-sGC signalling, so that sub-maximally active concentrations of NO reach a maximal activation of sGC. On their own, sGC stimulators have only a marginal effect on sGC. As drug target , there is currently only one FDA-approved medication that targets sGC. Riociguat (trade name Adempas) is the first drug of a novel class of sGC stimulators treat two forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH): chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Cinaciguat was another sGC stimulator that failed to demonstrate effectiveness in clinical trials for acute decompensated heart failure due to a high incidence of treatment induced hypotensive events requiring emergency intervention.

It was settled in 1875.  Background  The first Icelandic emigrants to Canada were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from the Westman Islands. The more general migration followed an offer from Lord Dufferin of land in Manitoba to establish what amounted to a \\"free state\\".William H. Swatos, Jr. and Loftur Reimar Gissurarson, Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland, New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction, 1996, , p. 53. Due to harsh environmental and economic conditions in Iceland, including the eruption of Mount Askja, some 20,000 Icelanders left their homeland between 1870 and 1915‚Äîroughly a quarter of the population of Iceland. In 1875 a large group of Icelandic immigrants migrated from Ontario to Manitoba, leaving Kinmount, Ontario, on 25 September 1875, for Gimli, Manitoba, on the shores of Lake Winnipeg. One of the main reasons for the choice of the colony site was ‚Äúthe abundance of fish‚Äù in Lake Winnipeg, but according to Icelandic People in Manitoba, ‚Äútheir first attempts at fishing on Lake Winnipeg were not successful‚Äù. Moreover, the ‚Äúwinter of 1875‚Äì1876 was one of the coldest on record in Manitoba, and the settlers‚Äô clothes, including the leather shoes from Ontario, were not suitable for the rigorous weather‚Äù. However, the immigrants eventually learned to handle the ax, prepare the soil, fish through ice, and hunt game. They also learned how to drain the land, grow crops, and build better houses. These Icelandic settlers, known in their native language as Vestur-√çslendingar (meaning Icelanders in the West; initially many Icelanders did not see emigration as a change of country, and there was some discussion of moving the entire population), called their settlement \\"New Iceland\\", and the region remains a symbolic center of the Icelandic heritage in Canada today.  Other information  *According to Statistics Canada (government agency), Manitoba is home to the largest Icelandic population outside of Iceland. There are about 26,000 people with Icelandic ancestry living in Manitoba,Statcan - Manitoba Icelandic Population making up about 2% of the total population of the province.

Named for Berkshire County, Massachusetts, she was the only U.S. naval vessel to bear the name. LST-288 was laid down on 6 September 1943 at Ambridge, Pennsylvania by the American Bridge Company; launched on 7 November 1943; sponsored by Miss Virginia M. Plofchan; placed in reduced commission on 4 December 1943; ferried down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana; and placed in full commission at New Orleans on 20 December 1943 with Lieutenant Edwin L. McCloud, USNR, in command. Service history =Invasion of France, 1944= LST-288 commenced her shakedown training on 19 January 1944 and returned to New Orleans for her post-shakedown availability on 4 February. On 14 February, the tank landing ship set sail for New York where she loaded ammunition. A week of preparation for a transatlantic passage at Boston ensued, and then she departed for Halifax, Nova Scotia on 10 March. She joined convoy SC-155 and departed for the United Kingdom on the 14th. The convoy reached Milford Haven, Wales on the 29th and two days later, LST-288 stood out for Plymouth. She remained at Plymouth throughout April and May readying herself for \\"Operation Overlord\\", the long- awaited, cross-channel invasion of Europe. On 31 May she loaded 425 soldiers and 116 vehicles and \\"sealed up\\" in order prevent any news of the invasion preparations from leaking. The tense week of waiting that followed seemed to be at an end when she set sail on the 4th. However, abominable weather conditions obliged the Allied command to recall the invasion flotilla and postpone the operation for at least 24 hours. Fortunately, the weather cleared in the interim, and the 4,000 ships and landing craft assembled for the assault on the beaches of Normandy departed for the real thing on the 5th. LST-288 stood out of Plymouth as a unit of Western Naval Task Force's follow- up Force \\"B\\", to which the assignment of reinforcing the beachheads established during the early hours of the attack belonged. LST-288 anchored approximately 2,000 yards off Omaha Beach at 1830 on D-Day, 12 hours after the initial assault. By 8 June, the troops and vehicles on board had left the ship, and she joined a convoy returning to England. During the four weeks following the invasion, LST-288 completed seven cross-channel trips, transporting 1,534 Allied officers and men and 627 vehicles to France while returning 601 casualties to England. On 7 July she disembarked men and material at Normandy for the final time and returned to Falmouth, England. =Mediterranean, 1944= On 18 July she departed England as part of a Mediterranean-bound convoy, arriving on the North African coast at Bizerte 10 days later. After a three-day stopover at the Tunisian port at the end of July, she moved on to Naples where she unloaded her cargo on 2 August. Except for a brief excursion on the 6th and 7th to carry troops, vehicles, and provisions down the Italian coast to Salerno, she remained at Naples readying herself for \\"Operation Dragoon\\", the invasion of southern France. On 9 August the tank landing ship embarked elements of the Army's 45th Division and awaited the order to depart for southern France. The order came on 12 August, and she left Castellamare Bay as a unit of Task Force (TF) 85, under the command of Rear Admiral Rogers. The task force reached Bougnon Bay during the early morning hours of 15 August. By 0742, LST-288 had dispatched her LCVPs and DUKWs, which brought her infantrymen to Delta Beach at 0930. Two hours later, she began transferring vehicles to attending LCTs by marrying the landing craft to her bow. The last vehicle rolled into an LCT at 1525, prompting the landing ship to raise the ramp, close the bow doors and join a convoy bound for Ajaccio, Corsica. Before she departed the area for Bizerte on 29 October, LST-288 made nine voyages to southern France and two to Livorno, Italy. During this period, she transported over 3,100 soldiers and 600 vehicles and removed 1,000 German POWs from France. =Return to the US, 1944-1945= On 31 October LST-288 put in at Bizerte for eight days of repairs and maintenance. In company with and , she set out for Oran, Algeria on 8 November. After pausing at La Maddalena, Sardinia to load cargo and soldiers, she reached Oran on the 18th and commenced six days of replenishment. On the 24th, she joined a convoy of 28 LSTs, 35 LCI(L)s, eight minesweepers, and two destroyer escorts and set course for the United States, reaching Norfolk, Virginia on 11 December. Three days later, the tank landing ship shifted north to the Navy's ammunition depot at Earle, New Jersey where the ship underwent a month of yard availability while most of her crew enjoyed leave. On 18 February 1945 she loaded construction supplies at Davisville, Rhode Island, then returned to New York to take on board, before steaming to Norfolk on 2 March. =Pacific, 1945-1950= On 7 March LST-288 departed for the Pacific, making a brief stop at Guantanamo Bay en route to Panama. A steering failure while transiting the canal necessitated two days of repairs before she left Panama on the 23rd. On 12 April, she entered Pearl Harbor and began 10 days of replenishment before embarking on a seven-week voyage to Okinawa that included visits to Eniwetok, Guam, and Saipan. When LST-288 anchored off Okinawa on 30 May, the Japanese defenders had just over three weeks of determined resistance left in them. The landing ship disembarked over 1000 officers and enlisted men on the 31st, but waited to unload the vehicles on board until 15 June. After that, she operated off Okinawa for two weeks and then headed for Saipan. Arriving at Saipan on 6 July, she spent two days in drydock to repair hull damage suffered during the Okinawa beaching. In all, LST-288 stayed at Saipan nearly three weeks before setting out for the Philippines on the 24th in company with an LST convoy, The tank landing ship remained there beyond the Japanese surrender on 15 August into early September. On the 3rd, she set sail for Tokyo Bay where she disembarked elements of the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion. She departed Tokyo on 19 September for Leyte where she took on board Japan-bound soldiers and supplies and arrived at Otaru on 19 October. After another six months of duty in the Far East, LST-288 was decommissioned at Yokohama on 6 March 1946 and transferred to the Shipping Control Administration, Japan (SCAJAP). She served with SCAJAP until the spring of 1950, at which time she sailed back to the United States to be returned to the Navy. =Decommissioning and transfer to South Korea, 1950-= Turned over to the Commandant, 13th Naval District at Bremerton, Washington on 14 June 1950 she remained under his cognizance until berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet's Bremerton Group on 15 November 1950. On 1 July 1955 the tank landing ship was named USS Berkshire County (LST-288), but never saw active service under the name. She was later transferred to the Republic of Korea on 5 March 1956 and commissioned as ROKS Ke Bong (LST-810). On 15 November 1974, while she was still on loan to South Korea, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Her final fate is unknown. LST-288 received three battle stars for her World War II service.

Background The Heydon family owned Baconsthorpe Castle in Norfolk. Born in Surrey, Heydon was the eldest son of Sir William Heydon (1540‚Äì1594) of Baconsthorpe, Norfolk, and his wife Anne, daughter of Sir William Woodhouse of Hickling, Norfolk. The family was powerful in Norfolk affairs, owning many manors and living at Baconsthorpe Castle, a large country house in North Norfolk.Capp, Bernard, Heydon, Sir Christopher (1561‚Äì1623), soldier and writer on astrology in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004) Education Heydon was educated at Gresham's School, HoltI Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School by S. G. G. Benson and Martin Crossley Evans (James & James, London, 2002) and Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he knew the young Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and after graduating BA in 1579 travelled widely on the continent. Dispute with his father Deeply in debt, Heydon's father Sir William had mortgaged Baconsthorpe and was in need of the Queen's protection from his creditors. In 1590 he tried to sell much of his land, but his son challenged him, as the estates were entailed on him. Sir William then threatened to demolish Baconsthorpe Castle, but his son got an Order from the Privy Council, which condemned the plan as unnatural. The dispute dragged on for years, and when Sir William died in 1594, he left his estate to his widow, but Heydon then went to law against her. Lady Heydon appealed to Queen Elizabeth, and the dispute was settled on her orders by the Lord Keeper. Heydon was left with inherited debts of ¬£11,000, as well as his own of over ¬£3,000 ‚Äì huge sums in the 16th century. Career In 1586, while he was still a young man, Heydon stood for the Norfolk county constituency of the Parliament of England. Although defeated, the Privy Council of England ordered a fresh poll, which Heydon won. The House of Commons challenged the council's constitutional right to interfere in elections, and the second election was quashed. Heydon stood again for parliament in 1588, again successfully. He served as a Justice of the Peace from 1586 and was a commissioner for musters in the 1590s. He joined the Earl of Essex and took part in his capture of C√°diz in 1596, where he was knighted. In October 1600 Heydon challenged Sir John Townshend to a duel, but it was forbidden by the Privy Council. After his father's death, Heydon mortgaged Baconsthorpe, and with his brother John he took part in the Essex revolt of 1601, leading rebel troops through Ludgate, which marked the end of his public life. Heydon went into hiding and wrote to Sir Robert Cecil, offering to pay a fine. Cecil worked to get him a pardon. Heydon was held in the Fleet Prison, but was pardoned for ¬£2,000. His finances were very low, and in 1614 he was forced to mortgage the rest of his estates. Writer on astrology Heydon was famous as a champion of astrology. His best-known work was A Defence of Judiciall Astrologie (1603), the most substantial English defence of astrology of its day, rebutting John Chamber's A Treatise Against Judiciall Astrologie (1601), which had called for parliament to outlaw astrology. Heydon argued that it was a valid science, compatible with Christianity. He drew upon Tycho Brahe and others. In writing A Defence of Judiciall Astrologie, Heydon had the help of the Reverend William Bredon, who was both a clergyman and an astrologer and was at the time Heydon's chaplain. William Lilly says whimsically of him: \\"William Bredon... had a hand in composing Sir Christopher Heydon's Defence of Judicial Astrology, being that time his chaplain he was so given over to tobacco and drink, that when he had no tobacco, he would cut the bell-ropes and smoke them.\\"Lilly, William, History of My Life and Times (1715, reprinted by Charles Baldwin, 1822), p. 75 Heydon also wrote but did not publish An Astrological Discourse with Mathematical Demonstrations (c. 1608), a further defence of astrology drawing on Kepler, with a short account of the 1603 conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter. The manuscript passed to the astrologer Nicholas Fiske, whose attempts to publish it failed, but it appeared in an edited form in 1650, subsidised by Elias Ashmole, with a preface by William Lilly. Heydon's work was given weight by his social standing and the lack of challenges to it. No reply by Chamber appeared, and George Carleton's The Madnesse of Astrologers (1624) was published only twenty years later. Heydon also made elaborate predictions for 1608 and 1609, which remained unpublished. =Bibliography= *A Defence of Judiciall Astrologie by Christopher Heydon (1603) *An astrological discourse with mathematical demonstrations, proving the powerful and harmonical influence of the planets and fixed stars upon elementary bodies, in justification of the validity of astrology. Together with an astrological judgment upon the great conjunction of Saturn & Jupiter 1603, Written by that worthy learned gentleman Sir Christopher Heydon, Knight, and now published by Nicholas Fiske, Jatromathematicus [c. 1608, first published 1650] *Astrology: The wisdom of Solomon in miniature, being a new doctrine of nativities... or, the art of determining future events by Christopher Heydon *The new astrology, or, The art of predicting or foretelling future events by the aspects, positions, and influence of the heavenly bodies: founded on scripture, experience, and reason... in two parts by Christopher Heydon Predictions Heydon's predictions on European politics were strongly Protestant. He foresaw that Spain would lose the Indies and predicted that the Austrian Habsburgs would fall in 1623 and Rome in 1646: this would lead to the ruin of the Ottomans and the rise of Christ's kingdom, \\"the fifth Monarchie of the World\\", in about 1682. He remained a champion of militant Protestantism to the end. Astronomer He had many astronomical interests and was a close friend of the mathematician Henry Briggs and the astronomer John Bainbridge, lending them instruments, sending them astronomical papers, and inviting them to stay at Baconsthorpe.Christopher Heydon correspondence, Bodl. Oxf., MSS Ashmole 242, 1729 He wrote a treatise on the comet of 1618 and described his own astronomical observations with instruments made by his friend Edward Wright. Family Heydon married, first, Mirabel, daughter of the London alderman Sir Thomas Rivet, but she died at the age of twenty-two. Heydon built her a large and ornate tomb at Saxlingham, covered with hieroglyphs which he explained in a treatise now lost. The second son of this marriage was Sir John Heydon, a royalist ordnance officer. He married secondly Anne, daughter of John Dodge and widow of John Potts of Mannington, Norfolk, in or before 1599. She died in 1642.

Biography James Edwin Orr was born on 15 January 1912 in Belfast in Northern Ireland, of American-British parentage. He was one of the five children of William Stewart Orr and Rose Orr (nee Wright). He studied at the College of Technology, Belfast. In 1930 or 1931, after spending some years as a baker, Orr began evangelising, not only in Britain but also elsewhere in Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa. During these years he also wrote several accounts of his tours of preaching. On 15 January 1937 he married Ivy Muriel Carol Carlson. They would have four children. After their marriage the Orrs evangelised in Australia (1939) China, Canada and the United States of America. In 1939 Orr enrolled at Northwest University. On 15 January 1940 he was ordained into the Baptist Christian ministry, at Newark, New Jersey, United States. He received his MA from Northwest University in 1941, and his ThD from Northern Baptist Seminary in 1943. During World War II he served as a chaplain in the US Air Force in the Pacific. After the war he continued his studies and took his PhD at Oxford University in 1948, with a thesis on the second evangelical awakening in Britain. In 1949 he and his wife made the United States their permanent base, while continuing to travel the world promoting church revival and renewal. They eventually travelled to 150 countries. In 1966 or 1967 Orr became a Professor at the School of World Missions, in Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California. He remained a professor there until 1981, and a professor emeritus thereafter. Of him Billy Graham wrote, \\"Dr. J. Edwin Orr, in my opinion, is one of the greatest authorities on the history of religious revivals in the Protestant world.; introduction by \\"William Frankland[sic] Graham,\\" p. 3, subscribed \\"Billy Graham\\" at end, p. 4 Online pdf From 1951 he was influential in Campus Crusade for Christ, and was one of the five original board members of that organization. (The other board members were Henrietta Mears, Billy Graham, Dawson Trotman, and Dan Fuller) He wrote numerous books‚Äîmany of them histories of evangelical revivals‚Äîand authored a number of hymns. One of them‚Äî\\"Cleanse Me\\"‚Äîwas selected for inclusion in Amazing Grace: 366 Inspiring Hymn Stories for Daily Devotions and The One Year Great Songs of Faith. p. 271 The words of \\"Cleanse Me\\" are based on Psalm 139:23-24 and Psalm 51:2; it is set to the Maori folk tune PO ATA RAU (translated as \\"Now Is the Hour\\"). It was written in 1936 when Orr was at an Easter revival meeting in NgƒÅruawƒÅhia, New Zealand, where he heard and was enchanted by the Maori Song of Farewell., p. 59 \\"Cleanse Me\\" has been recorded numerous times, with performances by Bill and Gloria Gaither, Irene Bridger, Kenon D. Renfrow, Lloyd Williams, the El Paso Wind Symphony, and Nick Reynolds and Tom Parsons available from one online music store.The Apple iTunes Store. Nowadays \\"Cleanse Me\\" is commonly rendered to \\"Search Me, O God\\" and the PO ATA RAU tune named MAORI in hymnals.‚ÄúSearch Me, O God‚Äù at the Cyber Hymnal. The ‚ÄúSearch Me‚Äù wording ties the hymn more closely to the biblical reference, Psalm 139:23 (‚ÄúSearch me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts‚Äù). Orr was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the American Geographical Society, the Royal Historical Society, and the Royal Society of Literature.

Originally it was called Crosby Corners after John Crosby (born 1797), the village's first store owner, who came originally from New York State. The name was changed to Cashel in 1851 with the opening of its first post office (located at southwest corner of Major Mackenzie and McCowan Road - now farmland). It was likely named after Cashel in Ireland. In 1851 the community had a sawmill, cobbler shop, blacksmith shop, wagon shop, inn and tavern, Masonic Lodge, and Presbyterian church.

The long highway extends southeast from an interchange with (I-5) in Lacey to in Yelm. SR 510 roughly parallels the Nisqually River, the border between Thurston and Pierce counties, between the Fort Lewis and Nisqually Indian Community area to Yelm. The roadway was built by 1916 as a connector from Saint Clair Lake to the Northern Pacific Railway station in Yelm and was designated as Secondary State Highway 5I (SSH 5I) in 1937. The original route of SSH 5I ran from Tumwater east to Yelm, following the present-day Yelm Highway. In 1959, the highway was realigned to serve a new freeway, later I-5, in Lacey; SSH 5I was replaced in the 1964 highway renumbering by SR 510\\\\. The Yelm-Tenino Trail was built over the Northern Pacific line in 1993 and a bypass is being constructed around Yelm. Route description SR 510 begins as Marvin Road at exit 111, a diverging diamond interchange on (I-5) in southern Lacey. The highway travels south by the Hawks Prairie Village Mall, home of the Hawks Prairie Center, a division of the South Puget Sound Community College. South of the mall is the Martin Way intersection, located west of River Ridge High School and one of the busiest intersections on the roadway at a daily average of 24,000 motorists in 2008, and the Pacific Avenue roundabout, where SR 510 turns east, renamed Pacific Avenue, northeast of Long Lake. After leaving Lacey city limits, the roadway begins to parallel the Quadlok line owned by Tacoma Rail south towards the Old Pacific Highway. At the Old Pacific Highway, the road becomes the St. Clair Cutoff Road, named for nearby Saint Clair Lake, and crosses the railroad tracks twice. After turning northeast, parallel to Saint Clair Lake's shoreline, the highway dips southeast, now parallel to the Nisqually River, into Fort Lewis and the Nisqually Indian Community. Outside of the community, SR 510 is renamed the Yelm Highway and passes Southworth Elementary. After intersecting Mudd Run Road, future western terminus of the Yelm Loop, the roadway enters Yelm city limits. After turning southeast, SR 510 becomes Yelm Avenue and serves Yelm High School. Shortly thereafter, the roadway serves Yelm Middle School, crosses the Yelm-Tenino Trail, a long rail trail in operation since 1993, and ends at First Street, signed as , which continues southeast as Yelm Avenue. History SR 510 began as an unsigned county-maintained road that ran from the Saint Clair Lake area to the Northern Pacific Railway station at Yelm, constructed by 1916. The road later extended west to Tumwater and designated Secondary State Highway 5I (SSH 5I) in 1937. The old route followed present- day Yelm Highway on the southern side of Saint Clair Lake and Patterson Lake to Tumwater. In 1959, SSH 5I was moved to a northern route to the (US 99) and freeway in Lacey. SR 510 officially replaced SSH 5I after the 1964 highway renumbering; US 99 and US 410 also became (I-5) in 1968. SR 510 between I-5 and Pacific Avenue was reconstructed and widened in late 2003, with the addition of a roundabout at the Pacific Avenue intersection. The I-5 interchange was replaced by a diverging diamond interchange that began construction in October 2018 and opened in August 2020. The interchange was the first diverging diamond constructed in Washington and is estimated to cost $72 million, with funding provided by the state legislature's 2015 Connecting Washington package. Alternate route State Route 510 Alternate, also known as the Yelm Loop, is a partially completed bypass of Yelm. The first, section opened to traffic in October 2010 and cost $4.3 million to construct. The wide, two-lane highway begins at a roundabout with SR 510 near the current Mudd Run Road intersection and travels east through a residential and industrial area, ending at Cullins Road. The bypass was designed in the 1990s in response to increasing traffic congestion and was funded by the Washington State Legislature in 2009. The second phase of the Yelm Loop project, which would finish the loop and extend it to SR 507, remained unfunded after the completion of the first phase. The state legislature's 2015 \\"Connecting Washington\\" transportation package will fund the $67 million second phase beginning in 2019.

These bacteria cause the disease ehrlichiosis, which is considered zoonotic, because the main reservoirs for the disease are animals. Ehrlichia species are obligately intracellular pathogens and are transported between cells through the host cell filopodia during initial stages of infection, whereas in the final stages of infection, the pathogen ruptures the host cell membrane.  History  The genus Ehrlichia is named after German microbiologist Paul Ehrlich. The first ehrlichial disease was recognized in South Africa during the 19th century. Its tick-borne nature was determined in 1900. The organism itself was demonstrated 1925 when it was recognized to be a Rickettsia. It was initially named Rickettsia ruminantium, and is currently named Ehrlichia ruminantium. In 1945, an \\"infection and treatment\\" method for livestock was developed. This is still the only commercially available \\"vaccine\\" against the disease, which is not a true vaccine, but intentional exposure to the disease with monitoring and antibiotic treatment if needed. In 1985, the organism was first propagated reliably in tissue culture. A new species of Ehrlichia was discovered inside the deer tick Ixodes scapularis. This newly found organism has only been isolated from deer ticks in Wisconsin and Minnesota in the USA. The species is known as Ehrlichia Wisconsin HM543746.  Evolution  The Ehrlichia genome contains many different variants of genes that encode outer membrane proteins, which have gone through intense modification over long periods of time. The great diversity in outer membrane protein genes is thought to originate from gene duplication events, followed by the fusion and fission of resulting paralogs of the gene. These duplication, fusion, and fission events form multiple gene copies and fragments, which are able to accumulate mutations. These copies and fragments of membrane proteins can then recombine, through a process called gene conversion, resulting in a new gene variant. This has a profound effect on the fitness of an organism. The survival of Ehrlichia depends greatly on the immune response of its host. With a higher range of outer membrane proteins, the parasite can evade the immune system of the host more effectively and establish persistent infection. The most pronounced evidence of evolution in the genome size of Erhlichia is the presence of tandem repeats, which vary highly among individuals and species. Over time, individuals may expand or contract parts of their genes and alleles, which adds genetic variation and may sometimes affect phenotype. Ehrlichia and its closely related genus Anaplasma show extreme diversity in the structure and content of their genomes. This diversity is direct result of rare clones with extreme genomes that emerged by chance after repeated bottleneck events, and this diversity persists because of the lack of selective constraints on rapid growth inside the host tissue. = E. ruminantium = The evolutionary changes in the outer membrane proteins have led to the emergence of new strains that can infect a larger variety of hosts. Heartwater, caused by E. ruminantium, is a prevalent tick-borne disease of livestock in Africa and the Caribbean, but also threatens the American mainland. Three strains have arisen from this species due to evolutionary change in their genomes. When sequencing their genomes,e many active genomic modifications have occurred, such as high substitution rates, truncated genes, and the presence of pseudogenes and tandem repeats. When analyzing substitution rates between the three strains in 888 orthologous coding DNA sequences, three coding DNA sequences were biased towards nonsynonymous substitutions that affect phenotype. In contrast, 181 coding DNA sequences were biased towards synonymous substitutions, which do not affect phenotype. This indicates that selection pressure to maintain protein function existed, and this selection acted against the nonsynonymous mutations. = E. canis = E. canis is a small, obligate-intracellular, tick-transmitted, Gram- negative Œ±-proteobacterium. This species is responsible for the globally distributed canine monocytic ehrlichiosis. E. canis also shows evolution in its complex membrane structures and immune evasion strategies. These evolutionary features are derived traits that do not show up in the previous lineages, which may indicate that these features may have contributed to a fitness advantage that kept this lineage going. Unique glycoproteins and major outer membrane proteins can be expressed variously using 25 different genes. The glycoproteins are important targets of the host immune response, attachment to the host cell, and other features in the immune response. The more outer-membrane protein genes that can be expressed, the higher the chance the organism can avoid being recognized by the host's immune system. Also, reductive evolution is present in E. canis. The genome has had a severe loss of metabolic pathway enzymes compared to its ancestors. Reductive evolution in obligate intracellular pathogens is usually the direct result of genetic drift in small populations, low recombination rates, and high mutation rates. The host metabolic pathway enzymes take control of the functions lost due to reductive evolution, and this contributes to its need for a host. Natural selection may not be the reason for small genomes.  Epidemiology  Despite there being multiple strains of ehrlichiosis, only two species, E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii, are currently known to cause the disease in humans. Amblyomma americanum ticks spread E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii bacterial infection in the Eastern and Southeastern United States, while A. phagocytophilum is spread by the Ixodes scapularis tick in the Upper Midwest; 1,518 cases of E. chaffeensis were recorded in southeastern, south-central and mid-Atlantic areas of the country in 2013. Despite the first cases of \\"E. ewingii\\" appearing in the Missouri in the year 1999, this strain was not reportable to health officials until 2008. Since 2008, there have been reported human cases of E. ewingii in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Tennessee though it is observed less frequently than E. chaffeensis. During 2008-2012, 4,613 cases of E. chaffeensis infections were reported through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The incidence rate (IR) was 3.2 cases per million person-years (PYs). The hospitalization rate (HR) was 57% and the case fatality rate (CFR) was 1%. During that same time, 55 cases of E. ewingii infections were reported through NNDSS. The national IR was 0.04 cases per million PY. The HR was 77% and the case fatality rate was 0%. In Minnesota and Wisconsin, four people reported symptoms that are associated with ehrlichiosis, and upon further research, neither of these cases was found to be E. chaffeensis or E.ewingii, but instead it was revealed as a new species, similar in genetic makeup to E. muris. Ixodes scapularis ticks are hypothesized to be the transmitting vector of the E. muris strain in these states. =See also= * Heartwater'' * Ehrlichiosis (canine) * Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (now called human granulocytic anaplasmosis) * Human monocytic ehrlichiosis  References  External links * Ehrlichia genomes and related information at PATRIC, a Bioinformatics Resource Center funded by NIAID * * Forum discution and clinical presentation (RO) Clinical experiences about ehrlichia and coinfections at dogs in Romania * Newly discovered species of Ehrlichia found in deer ticks Category:Rickettsiales Category:Bacteria genera ","title":"Ehrlichia"},{"id":"10487530","text":"USS Bernalillo County (LST-306) was an built for the United States Navy during World War II. Named for Bernalillo County, New Mexico, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-306 was laid down on 24 July 1942 at the Boston Navy Yard by the Todd Shipyard Company; launched on 10 October 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Caroline De Simone; and commissioned on 11 December 1942 with Lieutenant Joseph B. Bartram, USNR, in command. Service history =Mediterranean, 1943= After fitting out at Boston, LST-306 loaded supplies and ammunition before proceeding to the Chesapeake Bay for shakedown training. While there, her crew conducted beach maneuvers, practiced lowering small boats, and held communications and gunnery drills. She then took on supplies and cargo in Norfolk before proceeding independently to Bermuda in March 1943. Underway in convoy for Europe later that month, she arrived at Arzeu, Algeria on 13 April. After joining a convoy carrying supplies to Bone, Algeria in support of the Tunisian campaign, the LST spent the next six weeks ferrying troops and equipment between Oran, Mers-El-Kebir, and Bizerte. In June, the tank landing ship lay in Tunis Bay, preparing for \\"Operation Husky,\\" the planned landings on Sicily. As part of Task Group (TG) 86.1 in the \\"Joss\\" Attack Force, LST-306 got underway on 7 July and arrived off Licata, Sicily early in the morning of 11 July. Assigned to reserve transport duty, she helped relieve port congestion by transferring supplies ashore at Gela and its environs until 17 August when she sailed to Bizerte. There she began preparations for \\"Operation Avalanche,\\" the landings at Salerno. After loading British troops and equipment, LST-306 departed Tunis on 7 September and joined TG 85.1, the Northern Attack Force, for the voyage to Italy. After passing into the Gulf of Salerno, and avoiding several drifting mines, the tank landing ship anchored south of Salerno at 1215 on 9 September to await a clear beach lane. After pulled off the beach, LST-306 dropped her bow ramp at 1655 that afternoon. Under intermittent enemy shell fire, the tank landing ship disembarked 279 British soldiers and 57 vehicles before retracting to the anchorage at 1831. During the evening, enemy bombers attacked the beachhead twice, but no bombs fell near the LST. The next morning, LST-306 took on British casualties for evacuation and departed the area. Joining a Bizerte- bound convoy, the tank landing ship moored in that port on the 12th. She then spent two months operating in the central Mediterranean area, ferrying supplies between North Africa and ports in Sicily and southern Italy. Ordered north at the end of November, the LST passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and sailed to England, arriving at Milford Haven on 17 December. =Invasion of France, 1944= After unloading tank deck cargo, the LST moved to Falmouth for drydocking and a complete overhaul. After those repairs were completed on 10 January 1944 the tank landing ship began nearly five months of work in preparation for the cross-channel invasion of Europe. First, she engaged in three weeks of \\"Rhino ferry\\" (pontoon barge) practice landings in the Falmouth area. LST-306 continued this type of operation for the next four months, conducting various training maneuvers (such as troop landings, small boat exercises, antiaircraft gunnery practice, and communication drills) off the southwestern coast of England between Plymouth and Falmouth. Assigned to convoy B-3 in Task Force (TF) 126.4, the LST embarked troops and equipment at Falmouth on 1 June. After a false start on the 4th, LST-306 got underway in convoy the next day with a pontoon causeway and a small tug in tow. While en route to France, the LST collided with a buoy, snapping off a blade from her port propeller. As the convoy's speed was already slow (5 knots), the damage did not prevent the tank landing ship from continuing her mission. Just after noon on 7 June, the tank landing ship cast off her tow at Utah Beach before proceeding to Omaha Beach where she anchored for the night. During this time, the ship's two LCVPs delivered medical supplies ashore. The next afternoon, the LST disembarked 218 Army engineers and unloaded mine-clearing equipment to LCTs for transfer to the beach. At 1917, the LST beached and, over the next eight hours, unloaded the remaining 115 troops and the rest of her cargo of 52 trucks. Pulling off the beach on the morning of 9 June, LST-306 proceeded to Southampton, England for repairs. She remained there, waiting for an availability, until 17 June when she moved to Plymouth for repairs. With a new propeller in place on the 22nd, the LST moved to Portland Harbour on 26 June, loaded Army trucks and personnel, and carried them to Utah Beach the next day. After dropping them off, she returned to Southampton with 900 German prisoners. Over the next ten months, LST-306 made dozens of shuttle trips across the Channel, carrying troops, ammunition, and supplies from England to the French ports of Rouen, Le Havre, and Cherbourg. =Return to the US, 1945= On 11 May 1945 the LST joined one of the first convoys to head home after hostilities ended in Europe and arrived in Norfolk, Virginia on 31 May. After unloading her cargo, the tank landing ship proceeded to New York for major alterations in preparation for further combat duty in the Pacific. Entering a berth at Sullivan's Shipyard, Brooklyn on 11 June, LST-306 was in the yard when the crew heard the news of the end of the war on 15 August. Upon completion of the repair work on the 29th, the LST conducted a short shakedown cruise to Norfolk before returning to New York to load an LCT. Departing New York on 2 October, she sailed to Green Cove Springs on the St. Johns River in Florida, where she joined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 6 October 1945. =Decommissioning and sale, 1946-1959= LST-306 was decommissioned there on 13 June 1946. Although named USS Bernalillo County (LST-306) on 1 July 1955 she never returned to active Navy service; her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1959. On 22 October 1959 the tank landing ship was sold to Ships, Inc., of Miami, Florida. Her final fate is unknown. LST-306 earned three battle stars for World War Ii She was re-commissioned in 1951 during the Korean War and participated in practice landings with Marines while in the Atlantic Fleet. She also made visits to Venezuela, Cura√ßao, Cuba, Greenland, etc. in various exercises.

Puerto Rico, Singapore,Rungfapaisarn, Kwanchai. (September 16, 2006) The Nation Health drink in direct-marketing debut. Trinidad & Tobago, and the United States. Over several years, the company's spokesperson Earl Mindell made claims of unfounded health benefits from consuming the company's goji juice product called \\"Himalayan Goji Juice\\", implicating anti-cancer and anti- aging properties. Specifically in 2007, Mindell's statements were made during a hidden camera investigation by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation whose reporter, Wendy Mesley, questioned the supposed anti-cancer properties of Himalayan Goji Juice. During the same investigation, it was found that Mindell's Ph.D. qualification was in fact invalid, as had been questioned a decade before. Mindell's Ph.D. was supposedly conferred in 1985 by Pacific Western University, an unaccredited distance-learning institution with no campus. Authoritative databases of accredited US institutions exist at the Council for Higher Education Accreditation and United States Department of Education;USDE neither lists Pacific Western University as of February 2007. It was proven by subsequent studies that Mindell's claims were unfounded and based only on preliminary laboratory research on cancer cell inhibition, a finding that was never confirmed in other laboratory or human studies. As a result, FreeLife severed its relationship with Mindell in 2008, but was further associated with him as a codefendant in a 2009 legal case (below). In 2008, a FreeLife-funded study conducted on its own employees found that the use of their goji products increased subjective feelings of well-being. Questions on these findings were later raised due to poor study design and potential conflict of interest between FreeLife, the employed subjects used and the investigators who did the study. Products and marketing At first, FreeLife‚Äôs product line consisted of nutritional supplements, shampoo and personal care products. In 2003, FreeLife changed its product line to focus on a juice made from goji (Lycium barbarum) and sold under the product name Himalayan Goji Juice, and a newer product named GoChi. The company and its Goji juice were featured in the media frequently around 2007 and 2008 when the link between anticancer and goji berries were questioned. FreeLife products are sold through multi-level marketing to customers by independent salespeople who are paid commissions on their sales and the sales of their downline. Burge et al vs FreeLife On May 29, 2009, a class action lawsuit was filed against FreeLife International, Inc. in the United States District Court of Arizona. This lawsuit alleged false claims, misrepresentations, false and deceptive advertising and other issues regarding FreeLife‚Äôs Himalayan Goji Juice, GoChi, and TaiSlim products. This lawsuit sought remedies for consumers who have purchased these products in recent years.Class-Action Suit Filed against FreeLife and Earl Mindel A settlement agreement was reached on April 28, 2010, where FreeLife will take steps to ensure that its goji products are not marketed as \\"unheated\\" or \\"raw\\", and made a contribution to an educational organization.Breathe.org and FreeLife Joint Statement See also *Herbal supplements External links * FreeLife Official Website References Category:Companies based in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Companies established in 1995 Category:Multi-level marketing companies Category:Privately held companies based in Arizona ","title":"FreeLife"},{"id":"10487589","text":"Stuart Murray Balmer (born 20 September 1969 in Falkirk) is a Scottish professional footballer, who played as a defender. Playing career Balmer was a young player at Celtic, having progressed from the Celtic Boys Club, in the late 1980s. Having never made a competitive first team appearance at Parkhead, he was sold to Charlton Athletic in August 1990 for a fee of ¬£120,000.http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=365 He has the distinction of being the first outfield player in the English league to be allocated the squad number 1; Charlton in the early 1990s allocated their squad numbers alphabetically, hence Balmer (and not a goalkeeper as is typical) wore the number 1 shirt for the season. After eight years at Charlton, Balmer moved to Wigan in September 1998 for ¬£200,000. In three seasons there, Balmer made over 100 appearances before going on to play for several lower league English sides. Whilst at Wigan he also played in the final as they won the 1998‚Äì99 Football League Trophy. In July 2004, Balmer returned to Scotland as player/assistant-manager to Billy Reid at Clyde and then followed him when he moved to Hamilton Academical a year later. Balmer scored one goal for Hamilton, ironically in a game against former club Clyde. Coaching career In January 2011, Balmer joined the coaching staff at Ross County as assistant to manager Willie McStay. McStay was sacked as manager a month later, but Balmer remained on the coaching staff under Jimmy Calderwood who was appointed to manage the side until the end of the season. Ross County only narrowly avoided relegation and Calderwood left at the end of the season. Balmer was re-appointed assistant manager by Derek Adams on his appointment as manager in June 2011, and that following season the management team helped Ross County win the Scottish First Division championship and promotion to the Scottish Premier League. In a further readjustment of the coaching staff at Victoria Park in November 2012, Balmer took on the duties of coaching the Under-20 side., before leaving the club completely in May 2013.

After nine years, she became a researcher. Lush told Gaby Koppel in 2018: \\"I think I was quite lucky in that I found myself working for women bosses at crucial times and they took me more seriously and encouraged me much more than my previously male bosses had done, to believe in myself\\".

The coaster was previously located at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom as Zonga, Six Flags AstroWorld as \\"Texas Tornado\\", and operated for 10 years on the German traveling funfair circuit as \\"Thriller\\" After its time at Marine World, it was sold to the San Marcos National Fair, where it last operated. History left This coaster debuted as \\"Thriller\\" on the German funfair circuit in 1986, under the ownership of Oscar Bruch and toured the country until 1997, with a short spell on loan to the Gr√∂na Lund amusement park for the 1996 season. Its last fair was the Hamburger Dom of November/December 1997, after which it was taken to the now-defunct Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston, Texas. It was assembled at Six Flags AstroWorld in Houston late in 1997. The roller coaster opened at Six Flags AstroWorld on March 14, 1998 and was renamed Texas Tornado. This coaster had very positive reviews from guests but when summer hit, the heat and humidity seemed to disrupt operation. On very hot days the coaster suffered a lot of downtime. \\"Texas Tornado\\" continued to operate there in the 1999 and 2000 seasons with a lot of downtime on the hotter days. It seemed to run decently on milder and cooler days. At the end of the 2000 season, Six Flags decided to remove the ride but it stayed at AstroWorld in 2001 but did not operate that season. Early in 2002, it was moved out of Six Flags AstroWorld and into storage. In 2003, Texas Tornado was moved to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and some track modifications were made by Premier Rides. The most significant was increasing the elevation of the first two loops. The effect of this change would be reducing the Thriller's top speed and lowering the g-forces during the first two loops. It was assumed that the mild weather would enable the coaster to run better. It was then renamed Zonga. Zonga then operated for two years at Marine World. Unfortunately, operation continued to be inconsistent. Zonga regularly opened about two hours after the park and had frequent breakdowns. The ride wasn't very attractive because of its location (in a distant corner and hidden behind Roar) and appearance. There have been many malfunctions, which eventually led to Six Flags again closing down the ride. There have also been many complaints about the ride being \\"bumpy\\". The ride ran for much of the 2004 season but stood silent for the 2005 season and was removed at the beginning of the 2006 season, leaving a large empty concrete area at the front of the park. Zonga was disassembled and moved to the Discovery Kingdom parking lot where it sat throughout the 2006 season. The new coaster for 2008‚ÄîTony Hawk's Big Spin, now known as Pandemonium since 2011.

Removal From a news article published by a local newspaper on 23 October 2013, it was announced Tsunami would no longer operate in Mexico after La Feria de San Marcos ended in 2014. An idea was suggested to move the roller coaster to the Bad W√∂rishofen \\"Skyline Park\\" for the 2016 season. However, the move didn't occur and the roller coaster was dismantled in 2016.

A. cambagei is found primarily on flat and gently undulating terrain on heavy and relatively fertile clay and clay-loam soils in the eastern part of it range, and often forms mixed communities with brigalow which favours the same soil types. In drier regions, gidgee is found primarily on red earths and loams in wetter depression and low-relief areas. Gidgee communities are floristically similar to brigalow communities.

Browne, The Rise of Scotland Yard: A History of the Metropolitan Police (Greenwood Press, 1977), 153. Field is perhaps best known as the basis for Inspector Bucket in Charles Dickens's novel Bleak House. Early life Field was born the son of the proprietor of a pub from Chelsea. Career Field had hoped to become an actor, but his impoverished circumstances led him to join the Metropolitan Police on its establishment in 1829.Philip Thurmond Smith, Policing Victorian London: Political Policing, Public Order, and the London Metropolitan Police (Greenwood Press, 1985), 70.Paul Begg and Keith Skinner, The Scotland Yard Files: 150 Years of the C.I.D. (Headline, 1992), 26. Dickens's belief that Field was a Bow Street Runner is unsupported by the evidence. Entering as a sergeant with the E Division, he soon moved on to L Division and later the Woolwich Dockyards as an inspector. Around 1846 he joined the Detective Branch (on the retirement of Shackell), and retired as its chief in 1852.Browne, 122, 153. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery, London Charles Dickens had a particular fascination in the development of the police force in London and would occasionally accompany police constables on their nightly rounds. Through this, Field and Dickens became good friends, and in 1851 Dickens wrote the short essay On Duty with Inspector Field about Field and his work. Field was almost certainly the model for Inspector Bucket in Bleak House, and the parallel was drawn by contemporaries-so much so that Dickens wrote in to The Times to comment on the rumours, without actually denying them.Philip Collins, Dickens and Crime (Macmillan & Co Ltd, 1964), 204-207. There is also some suggestion that R. D. Blackmore may have based Inspector John Cutting, who appears the novel Clara Vaughan, on Field. In addition to these fictionalized portrayals, Field was frequently lionized by the press. In 1850 Dickens wrote three articles for the journal Household Words in which he told stories of the adventures and exploits of the new detectives.Browne, 122-123. With these articles he supplied character sketches of the detectives, with only the names changed. He gives us this description of Field: Later life After his retirement, Field was in the press again, appearing in a 2 February 1856 supplement of the Illustrated News of the World, which was devoted to the trial of Dr Palmer of Rugeley, accused of poisoning three people. Although retired, the supplement described Field as \\"Inspector Field,\\" implying that he was still active in the force. It also carried a memoir of his career. Field's actual involvement in the case was limited to a prior investigation of Palmer's financial activities, and he was not called to testify. Field's repeated use of his rank after his retirement, in his capacity as a private detective, caused consternation in official quarters, leading to at least two investigations of his conduct and a four- month stoppage of his pension in 1861. In 1865 Sir George Grey, the Liberal Home Secretary, dismissed the matter, as Field had finally retired from that line of work as well.Browne, 153-154. Field himself, perhaps with a nod to his original calling, enjoyed using disguises, even when not necessary.Smith, 70. Smith characterizes his habit as \\"self-indulgence.\\" Dickens thought that Field \\"boasted and play[ed] to the gallery\\" and otherwise puffed his own image which, as noted above, sometimes got him into trouble.Collins, 209. Field is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. Literary References Field is the main protagonist of the novel The Darwin Affair by Tim Mason.

Along with alcohol-related crashes, it focuses on the impact that their decisions would have on family and friends. The Every 15 Minutes program originated in Canada and was soon adopted in the United States first in Spokane, Washington. The site of the first Every 15 Minutes program in California was in Chico which was presented by the Chico Police Department in 1995. Officer Melody Davidson was the first to promote and organize Every 15 Minutes in Chico which was highlighted in a September 1996 LA Times article. Planning and events =Planning= The Every 15 Minutes program starts months in advance of the actual presentation, in fact the very first program at a school will take about one-year to plan and prepare. This includes all of the involved agencies, the police, fire department, paramedics, hospital, court, lawyers, judge, jail facilities, coroner/funeral home, students, parents and school administrators. Student participants are selected to cover the full spectrum of the student body, thus, the audience will be able to relate to at least one of the participants on the crash day. =Recent advances= Due in large part to major grants and guidance by the Highway Patrol, the program has made its way to even more students' hometowns. In recent years, the California Highway Patrol has continued to fine-tune the Every 15 Minutes program, which has always been over two-days - day one being the crash, with day two as the assembly, featuring speakers ranging from the student participants and their parents to motivational speakers, relatives who have lost loved ones in drunk- driving crashes (there are no drunk-driving \\"accidents\\"), medical personnel, lawyers and law enforcement officials. In southern California the program has also been modified by a civilian coordinator who has taken the audience away from watching on the sidewalk to sitting in bleachers, allowing for better viewing; eliminating the grim reaper (often viewed by students as unreal); and adding a texting element to the sober driver. This element brings the program added reality, as current figures indicate more teens are being killed in text-related crashes than in drunk-driving crashes. However, the grants are dedicated to drunk-driving and would be eliminated if too much emphasis was placed on texting. To still maintain the drinking emphasis, it is mentioned that the sober driver could have lessened the severity of injuries or death had they been concentrating on the road and not on the phone. Since its inception, technology has improved, giving a rise to the impact of the program and the gravity of the issue of drunk driving. During the event, new technology has allowed for a quick turn around of videography, allowing a comprehensive video of the cause and effect relationship between drunken driving and police involvement, family burden and community loss to be played at the second day's assembly. While student videographers sometimes take on this job, it is more common for professional crews to do the work. One early and frequent collaborator with the Every 15 Minutes program is Producer David Essary‚Äôs company Force4Digital, which has produced multiple productions yearly for California schools dating back to 2004. More recently, there has been a revival of student work, as schools either ask for one or two of their students to apprentice with the professionals, or students create a \\"making- of\\" film, shadowing the entire E15 process. Effectiveness Studies that have tracked students before and after the Every 15 Minutes program have shown that the program may have a favorable short-term effect on students' stated attitudes but no effect on actual behavior. This has led to charges that the Every 15 Minutes program is similar to the controversial DARE anti-drug program in that it produces the appearance of addressing the problem but does not produce the desired change in behavior. It has been long known that these types of approaches (i.e. scare tactics, dramatizations) that attempt to increase awareness or improve knowledge are ineffective.. Questions have also been raised about the basic premise of the program, that one person dies every 15 minutes in an alcohol-related crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that in 1995, the first year the program was presented, the rate was actually one death every 30.4 minutes in the United States. This was using the NHTSA's very broad definition of \\"alcohol-related\\" wherein the crash was defined as \\"alcohol-related\\" if any person involved had a blood alcohol level of 0.01% or higher. The nationally recognized DUI level of presumption in the United States is 0.08%. The rate of alcohol-related fatalities has gradually declined and was one death every 40.4 minutes in 2007, one death every 45 minutes in 2008, and one death every 56.5 minutes in 2015.

The highway travels north from SR 516 in eastern Kent to Renton, where it intersects Interstate 405 (I-405) and SR 900\\\\. The highway was originally built by the county government in the 1910s as a winding gravel road connecting local coal mines. It was straightened and paved in the 1920s and was designated as Secondary State Highway 5C (SSH 5C) in 1937. SSH 5C was replaced by SR 515 in the 1964 state highway renumbering and extended north into downtown Renton after the construction of I-405. A section of the highway on Talbot Highway was moved to a new bypass road in 1982 and other sections in Kent were widened to four lanes in 1991. The I-405 underpass was rebuilt as a half diamond interchange in 2010. Route description SR 515 begins at an intersection with SR 516 east of downtown Kent, in the business district of the East Hill neighborhood. The highway travels north on a four-lane section of 104th Avenue Southeast, passing Kent-Meridian High School and several suburban neighborhoods. SR 515 then diverts northeast onto 108th Avenue and crosses Harrison Creek, leaving Kent city limits near Panther Lake. The highway enters Renton and continues north through suburban neighborhoods along the east edge of the SR 167 freeway. It passes the Valley Medical Center at Carr Road and turns northwest onto Benson Road. SR 515 then descends from Talbot Hill and passes under a pedestrian overpass at Thomas Teasdale Park. The highway then supersedes a section of Talbot Road and crosses under I-405, which it intersects in a half diamond interchange at the south edge of downtown Renton. Talbot Road continues into downtown Renton, passing several big-box stores and SR 515 turns northeast onto Grady Way near the city hall. Grady Way turns into Main Street and travels north along an embanked section of I-405 towards the center of downtown Renton. SR 515 terminates at two intersections with SR 900, which is split between a pair of one-way streets: Houser Way, which also carries a street running railroad, and Bronson Way one block from the Cedar River and the Renton Public Library. SR 515 is used by King County Metro route 169, which provides bus connections to areas between Kent's train station and Downtown Renton. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts an annual survey of traffic volumes on state highways measured in terms of average annual daily traffic. Traffic volumes on SR 515 range from a minimum of 7,900 vehicles in downtown Renton to a maximum of 31,000 vehicles in northern Kent. History Benson Road, connecting Kent to Renton over the Benson and Talbot hills, was constructed in the 1910s as a gravel road serving local coal mines. The road was straightened and paved by the county government in the mid-1920s, with all but completed by 1928. Benson Road was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 5C (SSH 5C), which connected Primary State Highway 2 (PSH 2) in Renton to SSH 5A east of Kent. SR 515 was created during the 1964 state highway renumbering to supersede SSH 5C, while PSH 2 became SR 900 and SSH 5A became SR 516. The Renton Freeway (I-405) opened to traffic in 1965 and crossed under SR 515 without intersecting it. SR 515 was subsequently extended further north into downtown Renton over the former alignment of SR 405. Suburban development of the Kent and Renton areas in the 1960s and 1970s brought higher traffic volumes to the highway, necessitating an expansion project. The project, which would construct a bypass of Benson Road between Carr Road and I-405, was opposed by local residents and was frequently cut and revived due to limited availability of state funds. The $4.5 million, four- lane road was approved by the state government in 1981 as part of a new gas tax and was completed the following year. The remaining section of SR 515 in eastern Kent was widened by the city government in 1991 using funds approved by the state legislature. As part of a $84 million project to widen I-405 through Renton, a new interchange with SR 515 was constructed and opened to traffic in December 2010. The half diamond interchange consists of an onramp to northbound I-405 and an offramp from southbound I-405 and was intended to siphon traffic from the nearby SR 167 interchange.

Ayasaki household ; :, Muriel Hofmann (English), Jonel Bituin (Filipino) :Hayate is the title protagonist 16-year-old butler of the Sanzenin family. Hayate Ayasaki has had to work to support his parents' bad habits since the age of nine, always moving from job to job, before he was found out to be underaged. The experience gained in those days does mean, however, that of all the characters, he possesses the most extensive practical knowledge of how the world operates. Hayate's dad refused to get employed, while his mother is a compulsive gambler, and the whereabouts of his older brother, Ikusa, were unknown. These events led to their bankruptcy‚Äîthey abandoned Hayate and made an attempt to sell him to the Yakuza to ease their financial burdens on Christmas Eve, a debt of 156,804,000 yen. With not many choices left to him, Hayate conspired to kidnap someone to get ransom money. He found a girl, Nagi Sanzenin, and told her that he would kidnap her. However, Nagi mistook his words for confession of love, so he was later employed as Nagi's new butler. As a butler, Hayate is capable of all aspects of housework, but it is his ability in repelling attacks from almost anything (despite his bad luck) that makes him a \\"combat butler\\". He once demonstrated a skilled use of firearms (being able to wield an MG3 single-handedly) and is practically invincible with physical powers far surpassing that of any normal human being. In the beginning of the story, Hayate often mentioned Nello and Patrasche from the novel A Dog of Flanders, and compared his miserable situation to the characters' life. :In addition to looking poor and needy, Hayate can also appear to be extremely feminine. This has led to him being forced to wear girls' clothing or cosplay in feminine outfits such as nekomimi, a maid and so on. Later on, this female alter-ego is given a name: Hermione Ayasaki (Á∂æÂ¥é „Éè„Éº„Éû„Ç§„Ç™„Éã„Éº Ayasaki Hamaioni). He has been forced to cross- dress at other times. :Hayate had a girlfriend named Athena, who was responsible for teaching him cleaning and swordsmanship, as well as for building his strong body. Athena taught him that he must be economically strong if he wants to date with a girl. They had a falling out after his parents pawned an \\"engagement\\" ring she gave him. In chapter 239, after being asked by Hinagiku how he feels about Athena, Hayate describes Athena as \\"Not like the others,\\" and ultimately tells Hinagiku that he is in love with Athena. Athena would soon be possessed by King Midas and attack Hayate. Isumi and Sakuya explained to Hayate about Athena's possession and the importance of the King's Jewel. However, Hayate was unable to choose whether to keep the stone for Nagi's inheritance or to destroy it to save Athena. In the end, it was Nagi who made the choice, noticing Hayate's troubles. She destroyed the King's Jewel and Hayate was able to beat King Midas and rescue Athena. Both of them quickly embraced each other, after a long time since 10 years ago. Athena told Hayate of what happened after he left, about how a man came to save and free her from The Royal Garden. Hayate immediately recognized the man as his brother Ikusa. After these events, he tells him that she is the one he loved (in past tense), and he comes to deciding he wants to protect Nagi. Hayate would go back to Mykonos for one more day of vacation before returning to Japan. :Back in Japan, Hayate had to deal with the problem of Nagi losing the inheritance of the mansion. In the end, Hayate met Klaus who showed him an old house, \\"Violet Mansion\\" where they will settle in. After that, Athena appeared again in chapter 300, to ask Hayate where his brother was. She told him that she would appear again, and that he should act like they had never met before. She also stated that Hayate was the one she trusted most. When Hayate saves Ruka from a moving truck and apologizes to her for lying to her thinking that he was a girl from their first meeting, and soon Ruka falls in love with him. Recently Hayate, Linn, Tama discovered a mystery room (in chapter 368) partitioned in the storage room. After Isumi disables the barrier, Hayate discovers that the room holds the same coffin he saw in the Royal Garden 10 years ago. Shortly after that, Yozora shows up and burns the coffin whilst battling Isumi briefly. He later hosts a welcome party for the Violet Mansion tenants. Ruka offers to help pay off his debt along with hers before proclaiming her love for him, though Hayate declares he will continue to be Nagi's butler until she is a happy grown mistress. After the school excursion competition in America, Hayate wins the prize to pay off his debt though choose otherwise to remain as Nagi's butler. When the anniversary of their first meeting comes, the truth of the relationship is exposed due to Hayate's parents intervention, leading Hayate to painfully regret and wishes they never met and arrives in a world where Ayumu rescued him instead of Nagi while caught in the King's Jewel's dream world. Ayumu gives Hayate a newfound resolve then went to Nagi and reassures her that the fun things and his desire to protect her were real. After the battle for the Sanzenin inheritance ends, Nagi bravely fires him, which prompts Hayate to find what he wants to do with his new life, after two years he encounters a self-sufficient Nagi in the same place he met her, and tells her that even when he's not her butler anymore the desire of protecting her and wanting to be by her side hasn't changed. :Currently there are a total of 12 people in love with Hayate, many of which he has no clue to their true feelings due to his dense nature. They are: Hinagiku, Ayumu, Ruka, Izumi, Isumi, Maria, Nagi, Sakuya, Athena, Konoha, Yomi, and Kotetsu (Homosexual). However, Hayate has only shown interest in Hinagiku, Ayumu, Maria, Athena, Ruka and Nagi in the very end of the manga. ; :Shun Ayasaki :Mrs. Ayasaki :Hayate's parents, who appear only in flashbacks as faceless shadows with the characters \\"Mother\\" and \\"Father\\" scrawled on their faces. Shun has refused to get employed (on the ground that he is undergoing soul-searching and deserves no less than jobs \\"most suited to him\\") and his mother has been a compulsive gambler, which led to their bankruptcy. They abandon Hayate after selling him to the Yakuza to ease their financial burdens (a debt of 156,804,000 yen, or approximately US $1.9 million). Later on, Wataru and Hayate find out that Shun was a former member of Wataru's video store which owed Wataru 1,580,000 yen in unpaid late fees. When asked by Sakuya Aizawa if Hayate still has any desire to live with his parents if they had a change of heart and wanted to redeem themselves, Hayate states that no matter what he does, that would never happen; there are no second chances. In chapter 561, Shun suddenly reappear in front of Chiharu and Hayate, who, after a dispute, realizes that his mother disguised as a patient (with a wig like Yukariko's) and has been gathering information from Nagi in order to deceive her, and then tricks Hayate into confessing his romantic love for Nagi is false, leading to a final showdown. Following their failure, they try to flee but are ambushed and attacked by Hisui, with Shun abandoning his wife only to be beaten up by his eldest son Ikusa. ; :Ikusa is the older brother of Hayate. He has a very kind personality which Hayate likes about him. In a flashback, Ikusa is shown giving a friendly farewell and advice to a lady in a shawl that resembles Yukariko Sanzenin's. Hayate lends him a King's Jewel that Santa Claus gave him. Ikusa, in desperate attitude to save a person, who turns out to be Athena after she and Hayate had a fight with Ikusa, meeting Athena for the first time. He made a promise to Athena that he will let her see Hayate again. It is shown that he is incredibly strong, with very good athletic capabilities; it is hinted that his strength may be at the same level as Himegami. Ikusa helps all those that need help and wishes to be reunited with his brother Hayate. :Hayate didn't remember that he lent a King's Jewel to Ikusa until in chapter 437, having an encounter with Eight, Hayate finally meets Ikusa (cross-dressing) at a beach who calls himself \\"lifesaver\\". He beats up Eight for taking an octopus as of harming sea life, though Shiori reassures him. However, Ikusa doesn't recognize Hayate. As a result, Hayate displays an unusual behavior which scares the others. It is soon discovered that Ikusa is actually now a rich owner of the 'Asuki Hotel Resort'. But he refuses to hand over the King's Jewel. After going through such methods to earn the pendant, Hayate realized he had lost sight of himself (desperate to regain Nagi's inheritance, and feeling downfall of Ruka's departure) and reconciles with his brother. :Ikusa reappears in the final chapter where he confronts his hated father Shun, and while promising not to kill him, does not spare him from a severe beating. ; : :Suzune is a mysterious girl who appears in the movie, Hayate the Combat Butler! Heaven Is a Place on Earth. :It is later revealed that Suzune is actually Hayate's grandmother. Suzune returns to Hayate as a spirit that Hayate sees while on vacation with his friends at Ayumu's countryside. Suzune recreates an amusement park that Hayate once visited as a child with her. Suzune believed that Nagi was causing Hayate to suffer because of her spoiled attitude and that he only stayed with her because of the debt. Suzune gives Hayate a diamond that would pay off the debt so he could live his own life. Despite this Hayate returns the diamond to her and says that he wants to pay off the debt on his own beside Nagi. Suzune then departs to the afterlife with a smile. :Despite Suzune's slightly violent demeanor, she cares greatly for Hayate. She is very disappointed in her son Shun, for loading such a large debt on Hayate's shoulders. She only wishes for Hayate to be happy and goes to great lengths for him to be so. Sanzenin household ; : :The main female protagonist Nagi Sanzenin, 13-year-old, biracial, is the only heir to the Sanzenin fortune. She is short-tempered, spoiled, immature, but kind and cute. She has an otaku-level hobby with manga, anime and video games, and draws her own manga. Nagi has a large crush on Hayate, and she thinks that Hayate loves her since they first met. She sometimes tries to make him take an interest in her in many ways. She gets really jealous when Hayate makes some good statements on other girls. However, Hayate never understands why Nagi is mad at him, until finally Chiharu spoke about Nagi's feelings (in chapter 553) to him. :Nagi's only surviving family is her grandfather, whom she greatly dislikes. She regards Maria as an older sister figure. Nagi's mother, Yukariko, is shown in volume 12 of the manga. She cares for her family and friends, but she doesn't want to show her concern directly, she usually shows her concern with \\"formal words\\". Because of her pampered existence, she lacks any worldly knowledge and is even incapable of looking after herself. Nagi is mortally afraid of the dark (due to an incident with Isumi), and so shares her bed with Maria at night. Since going outside is very dangerous because of her status, Nagi favors staying at home, not liking company in general. Hayate managed to convince Nagi that sports is good for her body, and she is able to get into 2nd place on the Haku≈ç freestyle marathon thanks to Hayate's absorbing training and her huge amount of love for him. :While Hayate always reminded her to gather experiences on the outside world, she always thought that will be boring or she will always get lost and risk being kidnapped. Because of her family's wealth, she became the prime target of criminal organizations. Maria always states to her that without Hayate she will always get lost or in danger. Nagi disliked being a target and spent most of her days indoors playing video games and watching TV and hence slowly becoming a hikikomori. She begins to go to school more often after Hayate transfers to her school. Despite her laziness, Nagi is a highly intelligent student. She skipped grades and is currently in the first year of high school and in the same class as Hayate. :In Shimoda, Nagi decided to take Hayate and Maria on a trip to visit a mysterious meteorite that seems to enhance growth, along with other special powers. Nagi decided to help the alien, Maya, to find its misplaced spaceship. Nagi and Maya find the spaceship at the Saginomiya's place. Nagi accidentally boards on the spaceship, luckily Hayate saves her. When Maya sends Hayate and Nagi home, Hayate encounters Nagi's mother, Yukariko, in a dream and finds out the reason why Nagi comes to Shimoda every year is to remember the anniversary of her mother's death. :On the other hand, in Episode 52, during Golden Week, Nagi, Hayate, and Maria travel to Mykonos Island. Hayate got summoned back to the past when he jumped into the sky to get Nagi's hat back. At that time, Nagi feels uncomfortable going outside, because the Sicilian Mafia is after her. However, Hayate manages to defeat the Mafia but he made a few holes on Nagi's hat. Nagi doesn't mind and said that the holes are proof that Hayate saved her life. After this incident, Nagi falls for Hayate even more because he has vowed to protect her in the past, present and future. Both Nagis (The one in the present and the one from the past) fall for Hayate deeply. During Hayate's struggle to make a choice whether to destroy the King's Jewel to save Athena, Nagi sensed Hayate's dilemma and decided to destroy the king's jewel out of her own accord so that Hayate could now protect her truly, and not her fortune. She came across Athena on the last day of Golden Week. After coming back from Golden Week trip, Nagi was forced to leave her mansion due to her forfeiting her inheritance after she destroyed the King's Jewel. Later Nagi, Hayate, and Maria stayed at Yukariko's Violet Mansion and started new life. :Trying to sell her doujinshi to the public, Nagi went to show her hard work to Ashibashi-sensei but was shocked to realize her hard work was not good enough. Making a bet to sell out her doujinshi at the last Doujinshi convention, Nagi gets help from both Chiharu, Hayate, and Kayura in coming out with ideas to create her own doujinshi compare to Ruka her rival. After the Comisun event, Nagi decide to make a comeback at the Tokyo Big Sight to where the biggest doujinshi competition will be held there. Believing that having supernatural experiences will help create a concept manuscript for a new manga, Nagi takes an itinerary to Kyoto, but later got lost on the empty streets of Hokkaido until she's found late at night by Dr. Kurosu. Nagi determined to win the competition for Hayate's sake when Ruka confronts her feelings for him. As Nagi's manga, \\"30 Days of Soul Burning\\", is being sold and read, she soon realize what she had sincerely desire in her life. :Back home, Nagi is informed by her grandfather, that she can be reinstated as the heir should she brings him a King's Jewel. After a failed attempt to obtain it from Hayate's brother, Nagi orders Hayate to steal the Jewel in possession of Mikado instead. Despite knowing that he was robbed, Mikado accepts it back and agrees to have her become the Sanzenin heir once again. On the next Christmas Eve, Nagi finds out Hayate's true feelings and falls into great depression, and without Maria, her broken spirit unlocks the King's Jewel power awakening in a dreamworld where Hayate loves her for real. After reconciling with Nagi, Hayate made it so she won't suffer the same fate as her mother, rescuing her but staying in the dreamworld as he couldn't leave, back in the real world a tearful Nagi shouts Hayate's name, and he appears by her side thanks to their strong bond. Nagi gives Hisui the \\"Loto's Key\\" and the inheritance, saying she doesn't need it anymore as she is gonna earn her own money, but wishes to eat cake with Hisui sometime, after that she fires Hayate freeing him of his duty to protect her, telling him to live as he wants and love whoever he wants, Hayate accepts and leaves a tearful Nagi. After a timeskip of two years a now self-sufficient Nagi attends a normal middle school, living with Chiharu and Kayura who have failed to pay next year's tuition for Hakuou Academy. On another Christmas night, Nagi's about to get kidnapped in the same place she was rescued by Hayate, but this time she takes care of the situation herself, an observing Hayate surprised at her growth and tells her that even when he's not her butler anymore, his desire of protecting her and wanting to be by her side hasn't changed, and that there is \\"something he needs to tell her,\\" in which a smiling Nagi happily replies that \\"the night is young\\", locking hands after that and walking together, implying that this time their feelings are mutual and not a misunderstanding. ; :, Candice Moore (English), Davene Venturanza (Filipino) :Maria is Nagi's maid and is the only person who understands the true relationship between Hayate and Nagi. She appears to be the one in charge of everything in Nagi's manor, since everyone from Klaus (head butler) to the SP either obeys or fears her (or both in some cases). She is highly intelligent, somewhat devious, good at general housework and likes games of all kinds, though she is deathly afraid of cockroaches, which she refers to as \\"the dark life-form that exists in the kitchen and other places\\". She has also proved capable of self-defense techniques in times of need. She is, however, poor at disguises, as seen multiple times when she tries to spy on Hayate and Nagi and is recognized instantly. Maria is actually the one who saved Hayate on Christmas Eve after inspiring him that kidnapping is wrong and there is still good people in the world. :She was found in front of St. Mary's Church by Mikado as an orphan, where she got her first name. Not knowing anything about herself, her birthday was decided as December 24, the day she was found. She is the unfortunate one who always has to clean up everyone's messes. She has seen Hayate naked multiple times (and has been seen naked by him once), and she sees the effect he has on other girls, many of whom are attracted to him for his kind nature. Her own feelings for Hayate are very clear, and she blushes whenever Hayate saves her from danger. Also, when Hayate accidentally tripped on her, they both blush as well. Although she has chosen to put any feelings for Hayate aside in order to support Nagi's love for him, she has been shown to be curious about love. However, there are countless cases that Maria is unable to control her own feelings for Hayate. :Maria is also legendary throughout Haku≈ç Academy for having graduated high school at the age of 13 in just three years while maintaining the position of Student Council President for all three years. Because of this, she was able to recommend Hayate to Haku≈ç Academy despite him narrowly failing the entrance exams. Due to such unusual experiences, she both appears and acts in a manner more mature than people typical of her age. Because of this, even people near to her speak of her as if she is older than she really is, a pet peeve for her. She commonly responds that she is still a fresh 17-year-old girl and remains 17 years old (according to this phrase) throughout the entire six- month-span of the series. She may have met Athena as a child. After the Golden Week vacation, she was happy about Nagi wanting to have a normal life after Hayate found the Violet Mansion through Klaus. Afterwards, she and Hayate decorated and cleaned it to make it suitable to be lived in. When Hayate attempted to seduce Maria, a requirement to enter the Royal Garden, she confesses her decision to resign. After discussing over Nagi's misunderstanding with Hayate and timeskip through her fourteenth birthday, Maria leaves a letter behind. Inside contains a photo of the trio together. :Kenjiro Hata envisioned that Maria's last name is Ayasaki, indicating she is Shun's daughter from a different mother then was unknowingly abandoned; making her Hayate's older half-sister. ; : :Mikado Sanzenin is Nagi's grandfather and the head of the Sanzenin family, as well as one of the five directors in charge of Haku≈ç Academy. He lives in a mansion much bigger than Nagi's mansion with many servants. It is unknown where the Sanzenin fortune comes from but Nagi calls her grandfather an oil tycoon. He has the ability to judge a person's character just by looking at them. From what he saw in Hayate, he gives Hayate a pendant that is supposed to be his compass for life (but turns out to be a cursed pendant). :Even though Mikado is Nagi's only direct relative, they do not get along. This is evidenced when Nagi continuously hits him when Mikado says something that she dislikes. (Episode 11) Nagi dreads going to the main house to visit him. As a result, Mikado is not seen many times after his first appearance, although he makes a brief appearance in volume 12 when Nagi states that although she knows that no matter how much money she has, she cannot bring back her mother; there may still be some people in this world that do not understand this. However, it is obvious that he worries for her, which is shown when he tries to stop the assassination/kidnapping attempts and pushes them onto Hayate when he announces that he will pass the Sanzenin inheritance to the person who makes Nagi cry and beg for forgiveness and which later changed ‚Äì with the suggestion from Hayate and a little help from Maria ‚Äì to get rid of the butler first. This further changed in volume 21 of the manga, that the inheritance will be granted to the one who manages to steal or destroy the King's Jewel Mikado gave to Hayate. In episode 51 of the first anime, he hatched a plan to fire Hayate, although it failed to materialize. After Nagi lost the inheritance when she destroyed the King's Jewel for Hayate's sake and Athena, Mikado reveals the best way to have Nagi as his successor again is obtain another King's Jewel. Mikado later reveals that the true inheritor of the Sanzenin will be the one who write their name in his will, which is contained in a case that can be only opened by a special key, known as the \\"Loto's Key\\", which is later revealed to be hidden in the Royal Garden. Mikado personally tasks in foiling Hisui and Himegami's plot to access the Royal Garden. :He is shown to be not very fond of Hayate, mainly because Hayate's dream has nothing to do with gaining big money, or marrying Nagi. He is aware of Nagi's crush on Hayate. It appears that he was the Santa Claus whom Hayate met ten years ago in chapter 249. \\"Mikado\\" means emperor, showing his position in the Sanzenin family. ; : :Yukariko is Nagi's deceased mother. She was Mikado Sanzenin's daughter, and was friends with Mikoto Tachibana and Hatsuho Saginomiya. According to Hatsuho, Yukariko appearance resembles Hayate's. Yukariko appears in Nagi's dream and Hayate's illusion (in 2nd Season). It is also seen in chapter 187, that Yukariko was helped by Hayate Ayasaki's brother, Ikusa Ayasaki. The reason why he helped her is still unknown but the person was definitely Yukariko as her scarf is seen. It is implied that was how she entered the Royal Garden and gained the \\"Power of Royalty\\" since she was the \\"chosen one by God\\". She often said to Nagi that she would always look after her as the sky and the stars. She died of sickness when Nagi was about 5 years old. According to her character profile, she didn't die because of sickness. Her grave is in Shimoda, and Nagi visits it every year. ; : :Shin is Yukariko's late husband and Nagi's father. He was adopted into the Sanzenin family after marrying Yukariko. Nagi was about too young to remember him. He is also Mikado's son-in-law; he has a similar hairstyle like Hayate's. After losing his parents at a young age and growing up in a very poor environment, Shin always dreamed of becoming something big. Spending his adolescent days stealing from others, Shin grew into a well-known American thief until he met Yukariko. He proposed and they ended up getting married, and spent their honeymoon in Shimoda. :In the 3rd season, Shin had served Yukariko as her butler while planning his escape with the Kurotsubaki (Black Camellia), a clock that brings bad luck but can grant the owner a life full of miracles. However, he eventually fell in love with Yukariko and instead wished to be the man worthy of her. He died in a car accident in Las Vegas. Mikado reveals that Shin was a con artist who married Yukariko aiming for the Sanzenin fortune, or so he thought. In episode 11, reveals the Black Camellia is a magical sword that exchanges a person's soul, Shin was really inside the Black Camellia for 13 years until Hayate got stabbed, they switch souls, and Nagi finally meets her father (in Hayate's body). Shin wanted back the ring stolen by his former employer Dolly that signifies his and Yukariko's eternal love. At the end of the series, Shin reunites with Yukariko in the afterlife. ; : :Klaus is the 58-year-old head butler of the Sanzenin family, who is usually away on business. He was Yukariko's butler when she was young. He is jealous of Hayate because he does a better job than he does. He had made several plans to fire Hayate, but they all failed, a similarity to Mikado's failing idiotic plans. He saw Hayate crossdress as a catgirl without knowing that Hayate was forced to by Nagi and Maria. He is self-centered, has a low alcohol tolerance, doesn't do well with tobacco or women, and likes cars and bikes. Klaus once had a dog named Lucky that used to live in the Sanzenin garden, Lucky appear in chapter 183, chewing Izumi's doll before attempting to attack her, Hayate saves her by hitting him with a large stick. Klaus always gets beat-up by Nagi when he tries to fire or discourage Hayate. In the later series, Klaus swaps places with Hayate to serve the tenants at the Violet mansion. He is currently in love with Hayate's female character, Hermione Ayasaki. ; : :Akane was Nagi's former butler. A torn corner of a picture recently discovered (chapter 369) shows Himegami as a child. Judging from the way Nagi and Maria speak of him, he quit due to a problem related to Nagi's personality traits. Neither Nagi nor Maria seem to want to elaborate on his departure. Also with references from the first volume he was close to Nagi. He wrote a book on how a butler can acquire a one-hit kill technique, but later Nagi burnt the book. He is probably around Hayate and Maria's age. In episode 34 of the anime, he makes his appearance, but with his face obscured by the shadows. He returns once more in episode 38 wearing a mask. In episode 39 his face is shown. In chapter 225, Sonia Shaflnarz mentions that were rumors indicating that Akane might have been fired for trying to steal the treasure of the Sanzenin family that is associated with the King's Jewels. In the anime, he also insists that he be called \\"Princess God\\" rather than Himegami, which is a direct translation of his surname. He finally appears in the manga, under another name , during Hayate's fight with Hisui for the King's Jewels. In the occasion, Hisui claims that he is currently working as her butler. Is the revealed Himegami acquires the Royal Garden due to his unrequited feelings for Yukariko until Mikoto tells him the truth about Yukariko. :Himegami originally made a brief appearance on the bottom panel at the end of Chapter 146 but was later taken out and replaced with the panel of Hayate and Nagi holding hands. ; : :Tama is a white tiger from Africa, who was rescued by Nagi as a cub, and was raised on Matsuzaka beef and expensive tuna fish, making him incapable of going to the zoo or back to the wild. He can speak the human language, though he does not reveal this to Maria or Nagi because he doesn't want to shatter the girls' dreams. He will lay his life down to protect Nagi, as Nagi saved his life and raised him herself. :Despite the fact he is a white tiger, he was found by Nagi while she was exploring Africa. The manga artist admitted that he made a mistake when fans wrote to him pointing out there are no tigers in Africa. Because of this, when Nagi first finds Tama, she becomes convinced that he is just a cat. Usually when Tama is speaking or involved in a comical situation, he looks rather cartoon-like and, when standing on his hind legs, is about human size. He appears this way in most of his appearances, although he will occasionally be drawn in his actual size and appearance. He has been known to imitate other people's voices, and has done a perfect imitation of Nagi once. :Tama is often seen relaxing or doing human-like activities. However, he seems to enjoy reading male model magazines in his free time, which only goes to show Tama's odd behavior. He once fell in love with a tiger on a picture of a magazine advertisement for Brazil, and tried to machinate a plan involving Klaus' retirement just to get to go see her, before being reminded by Hayate that there are no tigers in Brazil. After Nagi had moved to the Violet mansion she requested that Hayate bring Tama into the new house. Later, Isumi has given him the collar of Nibelungs. ; : :The \\"White Kitten\\" Hayate receives from Hinagiku. He is black with a small white X-shaped scar in his forehead. He has a very devilish personality and deliberately gets Tama into trouble. A teary eyed Hinagiku had to say goodbye to Shiranui because her mom had cat allergy. Hayate then decided to take Shiranui and find him a new owner. When Hayate returned to the Sanzenin Mansion, he was immediately welcomed back by Nagi who caught sight of the cat. At first Nagi was doubtful as to taking care of the cat but quickly changed her mind and decided to make the cat a member of the Sanzenin family and named the cat as Shiranui. His name is a reference from the videogame Okami, whose protagonist is also known as Shiranui. Kenjiro Hata apparently was playing this game prior to naming Shiranui. ; : :Shiori Makimura is a genius scientist with the Mikado Hyper Energy (M.H.E) Electronics Corporation as the Chief of Development, Humanoid Nursing and Battlefield Weapons Department, and Advanced Technology Development Division for the Sanzen'in. Her specialties is computers and mechas. Her development team created Nursing Robot Eight and other mechas seen in the series. She is in fact so talented, that she had even built a mecha when she was half asleep. During her high school years she was the vice president of the student council in Hakuou. The president at that time was Maria. She enjoyed calling Maria nicknames like \\"Little President\\"; takes growth videos of her, similar to what the Hakuou Three Amiga does to Hinagiku. In volume 3, robot Eight asks her to be his girlfriend and she accepts, but later breaks up. In episode 23, Shiori is sent to teach her old school, Haku≈ç Academy, because her superiors believe she does not have enough heart. Another weakness Shiori has is that she is often quite forgetful, completely forgetting about building Eight and overlooking the installation of a critical control chip in one of her mechas, which lead to disastrous results. ; :Yomi is the daughter of the Sanzenin gardener. She is friendly with Hayate and often helps him in her free time. On hearing Hayate praise her, Nagi grows jealous of the \\"younger hard-working gardener girl\\". ; :SP leader :The secret police with a force of over 2000, they are hired by the Sanzenins to ensure the safety of the mansion's occupants (especially Nagi). They can be easily distracted from their duties sometimes, for example, once they were distracted by a concert while searching for Nagi at Haku≈ç Academy. Although they will obey Nagi's orders, her authority can be overridden by Maria (who will intervene when Nagi's demands become unrealistic), who can be considered the head of security for the mansion (in addition to being a maid). Aizawa household ; : : Sakuya Aizawa is Nagi's cousin and from Kansai. Like Nagi, Sakuya is very rich and has a similar personality ‚Äî loud, arrogant, abusive of servants, and unwilling to accept defeat in anything; Nagi is one of the few people who can stand up to her wrath, Sakuya is the one who has known Nagi the longest. Sakuya is the eldest daughter in her family with three younger sisters (Hinata, Yuuka and Shiori) and one younger brother (Asato). Sakuya is obsessed with stand-up comedy, especially Manzai style. She encourages Hayate to become a comedian because she believes that Hayate's life up to now is nothing more than a comedy. She is quite well-endowed for her age, easily surpassing Nagi, Hinagiku, and Isumi, and a match for the normally developed teenagers like Ayumu or Chiharu; so far only Athena and Maria are the ones amongst the \\"minors\\" of the cast to clearly surpass her. :Sakuya can often be seen hanging around with Isumi: she is usually present when Isumi performs exorcism, although she doesn't have any special powers. When Isumi disappears after seen in Greece with Nagi, Sakuya flies to Greece to look for her. She's not all bad though, since deep down she does care for her cousin. Sakuya is one of few people beside Isumi and Hayate who are involve with the Tennousu family and Royal Garden. :Sakuya develops a crush on Hayate in Episode 32 when he saved her from the demon monsters, evidenced by blushing. Her crush on Hayate is further evidenced in Episode 40. However, Hayate doesn't understand Sakuya's feelings for him. On the 5th episode of Season 2, Sakuya falls deeper for Hayate when he tidies up her clothing. However, she can't quite express her emotions, and thinks that Hayate is making fun of her instead. On the 19th episode of Season 2, she expresses her love for Hayate indirectly winking her eye after Hayate made her laugh on the 29th of March. On the 24th episode of Season 2, she expresses her love for Hayate again in another indirect way. He asks Hayate whether or not she can call him \\"Brother Hayate\\" instead of \\"Bankrupt Butler\\". She did this because her feelings for Hayate has grown. :On the other hand, Sakuya also develops a crush on Wataru in Episode 51. Her heart was touched when Wataru thanked her for giving him a spot in Hakuou. She also stuck herself close to Wataru on the 23rd episode of Season 2 when she thinks he did a good job on the gag show for the audience, as a sign of love for him. However, Wataru doesn't want her to stick that close, and pushed her away. Wataru then fell on top of Sakuya, making the both of them blush. Their feelings for each other has increased after that. :She rarely appears again, but during the Golden Week vacation, she, with Wataru and Saki, went to America. As Mikoto's bet against Wataru, Sakuya was dressed as a bunny girl and was subjected to strip if Saki lost in her gambling match against Mikoto. After battle with Wataru and his mother, she asks for Mikado's private jet to find Isumi in Mykonos Island, because she was lost. Then they appeared when Hayate was attacked by King Midas for the first time, she helped much in the final battle, and bring back everyone to Japan. Sakuya and Isumi are worried about Nagi's inheritance. But Isumi said that Nagi does not get help from her and Sakuya. Then Sakuya came to the Violet Mansion to see Nagi then she met Chiharu in there and keep her secret as a maid. She wants to understand Nagi's manga, but she can't. Then she helped Wataru for lending some money for his new businesses. ; : :Gilbert Kent is Sakuya's illegitimate half-brother. He does not look Japanese because of his brown curly hair and dark complexion, but Sakuya thinks they look \\"alike\\". After Nagi's grandfather announced a condition to inherit the Sanzenin fortune, Gilbert quickly begins to pursue the fortune, even begging for it. However, Hayate easily stops him from hurting Nagi and getting the inheritance. He later receives a mecha from Shiori Makimura, whom he refers to as a mad scientist, to help him in his pursuit. :Gilbert again tried to gain the inheritance during Hayate and the other's trip to Mykonos. He confronted Hayate and Nagi but was immediately beaten up and ignored. He finally asked for a handicap to make his chances better. His conditions for the fight was to play a 2v2 beach volleyball game, and if he won the King's Jewel will be destroyed. Choosing Hinagiku as Hayate's partner. Everything was going well for him because at that time Hinagiku intentionally held back in playing since she wanted to act weak in front of Hayate. However he made a mistake when he insulted her flat chest. The insults were enough to make Hinagiku serious, and with 1 hit of the volleyball destroyed Gilbert's partner. And with the final play of the game, Gilbert and his last robot were defeated. ; : :Mr. Aizawa is Sakuya's father. A man with a strange sense of humor, he is apparently proud of his \\"naked conversation skills\\", much to his children's horror. Despite this, he gets along very well with his younger children. ; :Makita :Kunieda :Makita and Kunieda are Sakuya's personal butlers. They don't appear unless they're told to do a task. Both butlers wear glasses and dark navy suits. Makita and Kunieda are very skillful, as they can complete tasks instantly and perfectly, even amazing Hayate with their skills. In the anime, it is revealed that Makita plays the guitar and Kunieda likes to read books. Makita is 35 years old. Kunieda is 34 years old. Saginomiya household ; : :Isumi Saginomiya is a girl who always wears a kimono and, sometimes, a stole. She is Nagi's best friend; they met at a party a long time ago. When all the other children, Sakuya included, laughed at Nagi's first attempt at writing her own manga, Isumi took interest in it and asked Nagi how it ends. Nagi then asked Isumi (in a childish sense) to marry her. As a result, Nagi has always asked Isumi for ideas for her own manga, but it proved that Isumi's ideas were even more awful than that of Nagi's. :Like Nagi, Isumi is very rich; however, Isumi is soft-spoken, kind, and a good cook. While she does not have an awful sense of direction, she constantly gets lost because she is apt to forget her destination and believes herself to be reliable and independent (a belief further enforced by the flighty nature of her mother and grandmother); the fact that she can disappear from people's eyes instantaneously only complicates the matter, without a guide, map and compass prepared 2 hours in advance she will get lost and then says the other people got lost. She also has a habit of saying, when she doesn't understand how to use a machine such as a cellular phone or a vending machine, that the machine is broken. She displays a high level of empathy for Nagi's feelings, yet she does not recognize Wataru's love for her, a fact that Nagi, Maria, and Hayate comment on. She has, however, seemed to have developed a crush on Hayate. :Although what Isumi actually did on Episode 24 was to decurse Hayate's pendant, she did confess to Hayate afterwards. Hayate, as always, misunderstands it as something else. In volume 5 of the manga, it is revealed that she can perform exorcisms. Humorously, she calls this power \\"hand soap\\", though Hayate assumes she means \\"hand power\\". She loves Hayate and does not wish to see him sad. :Isumi is the inheritor of the secret mystical power called Jutsushiki Hachiyo, the spell of the eight leaves. This power is only inherited by a chosen female child in the Saginomiya family. In volume 11, she loses this power, which causes some slight distress to Hayate as he would have to literally bleed through grueling trouble in order for her to regain it, but she rejects his help, saying that she does not wish to cause other people harm for her own ends. However, in volume 12, when Hayate is on the verge of tears thinking of a way to save Nagi from being blasted off into outer space, she kisses Hayate on the cheek (while he is bleeding profusely after being struck on the head by Ginka) and regains her power, sending Hayate speeding towards the UFO to save Nagi. :Later in the story, Isumi has a prominent role regarding the events about Athena and Hayate's past, by aiding Hayate in several ways during the fight against King Midas. It is also revealed that her hair temporarily pales whenever she overuses her power. Afterwards, she acts alone to destroy the remaining King's Jewel to prevent further risk of anyone from reaching the Royal Garden. Isumi thwarts Hisui and retrieve Nagi to escape the illusionary world as the Royal Garden collapse with Hayate staying behind, although he returns as well. ; : :Hatsuho is Isumi's mother. She is 31 years old. She forgets things extremely quickly, much to Isumi's chagrin. Like her daughter, she knows a lot about the spiritual realm and supernatural things. However she is hopeless when it comes to technological gadgets. She also has connections in the past with Yukariko. According to her, Hayate looks like Nagi's mother, Yukariko. ; : :Konoe is Isumi's grandmother. She is 64 years old. ; : :Ginka is Isumi's great-grandmother. She is 91 years old. She demonstrates a high capacity for fighting, as shown in volume 11, when she tries to defeat Hayate. However, this was all done because she was worried about her great-granddaughter, whom she cares very much for. Ginka normally looks like a young child, but this is only because she is able to stay healthy and alive by sucking on the blood of people who are close to death (driven to their critical limit). She promptly assists in major situations regarding the Royal Garden. ; : : : :An army of butlers' as skilled swordsman serves the Saginomiya family. Hayate mistook them as assassins upon his first meeting with Isumi. They are overprotective for Isumi‚Äôs safety due to her zero sense of direction. Tachibana household ; : :Wataru Tachibana is Nagi's fianc√©, but they have no feelings for each other. Wataru claims that his parents arranged their future marriage entirely for money. He lives and runs a video- rental store in the city, the last store owned by the Tachibana group, which lost all their assets and is on the verge of bankruptcy due to the recession. His dream is to make his store great and acquire a fortune greater than Nagi's. Wataru was in love with Isumi. He initially hates Hayate for accidentally stealing Isumi's affection, but later he looks up to him and strives to be like him. Despite this, he still calls Hayate by his own personal nickname for him, \\"Butler In Debt\\" or \\"Bankrupt Butler\\" (or a variation thereof), and doesn't hide his usual irritation. He's same age as Nagi, Isumi & Sakuya. :Later on in the manga, it is revealed in an off-hand conversation that Wataru's store is actually starting to do well and is making some profit. However, he has yet to retain a fortune that can match Nagi's. On Golden Week, Wataru took Saki on a trip to Las Vegas. They had a gamble with Mikoto to reach a decision since she started looking down on Wataru and his dad for their lack of business insight. Sakuya also ended up being part of the bet since they did not have enough money. Sakuya was dressed as a bunny girl and forced to strip if Saki lost in the gamble. They ended up winning by asking Hayate if he would choose red or black and choosing the opposite in the roulette. Wataru later receive a pendant (King's Jewel), from his mother, that is similar to Hayate's and Aika's. It is also shown that he cares for Saki, although in a different way from how he feels about Isumi. This is implied through the great means he often goes through to make her happy, or to otherwise make up for wronging her. This includes a time where he believes she is downtrodden because he had forgotten her 20th birthday, when he had also promised to buy her a furisode (a long-sleeved kimono used for coming-of-age ceremonies). In order to make up for this, he goes as far as to buy a 200,000 yen (roughly $1,650) yukata for her because the furisode was too expensive, and even rejects a chance (as he sees it) to win Isumi's heart. Later on, he realizes his love for Saki when he saw her face in his mind just before confessing to Isumi in chapter 330. After they deposit the money received Sakuya to a bank, Wataru decided to quit from Hakuou to manage his businesses. Then starts anew so his video shop \\"Doujinshi. Game. Comic. V. Tachibana\\" will profitable enough. ; : :Enky≈ç is the head of the Tachibana family. He was the one who arranged Wataru and Nagi's engagement and rescued Saki and her grandmother. He is currently overseas with Rei fighting crime. ; :Enky≈ç's daughter and Wataru's mother. She lives in Las Vegas with Jirousaburou, and has amazing business insight, claiming to be able to net 1 billion yen in 2 years from the land appreciation of Wataru's store. She considers both Wataru and her husband to have very poor vision in what relates to business. According to Nagi, she went senseless after her dearest friend Yukariko died, thus relying on gambling for a living. Mikoto meets Hayate in chapter 519. After a small nag because of his resembles to Shin Hayek, she gives him two King's Jewels gathered by Ruri Tsugumi due to Hayate's mysterious connection with Yukariko. ; :Jirousaburou is the combat butler of the Tachibana family. He worked as the host during the gambling match between Saki and Mikoto being held to determine whether Wataru would stay in the United States. Jirousaburou is confirmed a lolicon as he placed Sakuya in a bunny suit that rips the more Wataru loses the match, which was heading into a negative and embarrassing outcome for her. Kijima household ; : :Saki Kijima is Wataru's maid. She is 20 years old. She is significantly older than Wataru and lives with him in his video-rental store. Her biggest fear is that Wataru will start watching child movie when he reaches 90, which he agrees. She takes on a mixture of a servant and elder sister role to Wataru, often changing from being subservient to scolding him, depending on the situation. She also reacts strongly whenever Hayate touches her anywhere, such as tapping her on the shoulder or carrying her away from danger, worrying about whether or not their physical contact will affect her chances of getting a husband later in life. This is not only limited to Hayate, but other men as well. :Saki came in contact with the Tachibana family when Wataru's grandfather, Enky≈ç Tachibana, saved her and her grandmother, the legendary maid Rei Kijima, while they were traveling around the world searching for her missing parents (who, in fact, are not lost at all and live in Ueno). :Saki develops a crush on Wataru on Episode 25 by stating that Wataru has grown into an old guy. Further evidence proving this is on Episode 29, when Wataru holds her hand, both blushing. ; :Rei Kijima is Saki's grandmother and the legendary maid. She set off on a journey with Saki to find her missing daughter and son-in-law. While on the journey, she protected presidents from assassination, solved unsolved mysteries that would have been filed away forever, and liberated oppressed citizens by serving cuisine to emperors. When she was 62 years old, she was about to die in the middle of the Sahara Desert when Enky≈ç Tachibana saved her with his strong words. In order to repay the debt, she travels with Enky≈ç fighting crime. Katsura household ; : :The second female protagonist Hinagiku Katsura is the current Student Council President, and kendo club president at Haku≈ç Academy. She is 15 (currently 16) and is an expert with swords, specifically kendo. Her family is also quite wealthy like most of the other girls at Hakuou. She can also speak as many as 17 languages. She first meets Hayate when he is lost on the huge Haku≈ç campus and ends up rescuing her. She had been helping a baby bird who had fallen out of its nest, but due to her fear of heights, had become stuck without her realizing it. Hayate ends up helping her down the tree, and then promises that he will help her should she ever call for him. In gratitude, she invites him to the top of the school's clock tower, where only student council elites are allowed. She allows Hayate to call her by her first name and also seems to be infatuated by Hayate and his attractive personality. :However, in volumes 9 and 10, it is revealed that Hinagiku suffers from a past nearly identical to that of Hayate's ‚Äì she, along with her sister, had also been abandoned by their biological parents, who left them with a debt of 80 million yen (approximately 1 million US dollars) shortly before Hinagiku's sixth birthday. Following this, her sister, Yukiji, managed to pay off the debt (albeit through what the manga depicts as rather dubious means) and the two of them went to live with the Katsura family, as Mr. Katsura had been Yukiji's elementary school teacher. The hair clip Hinagiku is always seen wearing was a birthday present from her real parents. When Hinagiku finally sees the beautiful view from atop the clocktower on the night of her 16th birthday with Hayate's help, though, she finally realizes that she actually loves him. She had been afraid of admitting this to herself because she was scared that she would forget about her past if she fell in love with him. Later on in the series, after many interruptions, Hinagiku manages to confess her love for Hayate to Ayumu in order for her to help clear her conscience. Upon hearing the news, Ayumu cheers up Hinagiku, leaving her confused. She explains that although her feelings may not be returned, she is content to be with Hayate nonetheless and encourages Hinagiku to try her best, provoking a competition between the two friends. :Hinagiku is sometimes referred to as being rather masculine for a girl by other characters in the series. This is exemplified on Valentine's Day in volume 7, where Hinagiku is given a lot of chocolates by female admirers. Miki suggests this is because Hinagiku is seen as being \\"cooler\\" than the boys, and the fact that she was rather domineering at a younger age. This is similar to how Hayate is seen as being rather feminine. :When Hinagiku tries to confess her love to Hayate, he surprises her with his feelings, telling her that the one he loves is none other than Athena and that he needs to confess his feelings to Athena. Hinagiku advises Hayate to pursue his feelings and not be hesitant. She met Athena prior to meeting Hayate a year before. When she goes back to the mansion she's staying at, Hinagiku breaks down in tears, whilst trying to accept the fact that Hayate loves someone else. In later chapters we see that Hinagiku has decided to help Hayate and the others when King Midas made his move and attacked the hotel where the others were staying. She goes to Athena's mansion to help Hayate defeat King Midas and rescue Athena. Once Hayate and Athena are reunited (while displaying great signs of affection for each other), Hinagiku leaves in tears trying to give them some privacy. The next day, after the Athena conflict is resolved, she learns from him that Athena turned him down, but Hayate escapes before she is given a chance to pursue the topic. In Chapter 300 and 301, Athena (Alice) while in her child form calls Hinagiku her \\"Mama\\" and Hayate her \\"Papa\\" causing the two to be greatly embarrassed as those present make jokes on the misunderstanding. She eventually goes to live with Hayate in the Violet Mansion after Athena threatens to tell Hayate about Hinagiku's feelings for him. Listening to Hayate's refusal of dating girls, Hinagiku decides to help him as of getting close to him. Hinagiku suppresses her fear of heights for the sake of saving Hayate against Himegami. She confesses her feelings to Hayate in the final chapter of the manga, but his answer is not shown. :Hinagiku is the most popular character in Hayate no Gotoku. She has won numerous anime/manga popularity contests on the internet, the most significant of which is by winning first place in the 2009 International Saimoe League (the most prestigious and the most popular female- moe anime online poll). ; : :Yukiji is the 28-year-old sister of Hinagiku. She is a world history teacher at Haku≈ç Academy and doubles as a 24-hour gate guard. She refuses to let Hayate enter the school when they first meet because she is afraid that letting unauthorized personnel on campus will result in a salary deduction for her. Her attitude softens after Hayate first saves her from falling off the clock tower, but she still almost causes Hayate to be rejected from Haku≈ç by unnecessarily making him anxious during his entrance exam. She repays Hayate by telling everyone in her class on Hayate's first day that he is a super cool person. She has a group of underachieving students (Izumi, Miki, and Risa) who hang out with her a lot. She lives on the Haku≈ç campus; she tells Hayate that she does this so that she can save rent money and use that money to buy alcohol instead. It is a recurring gag that she will do anything for money, going as far as to allow an evil spirit to possess her because it told her it would give her a million yen. When Shiori Makimura is sent to teach at Haku≈ç, Yukiji is demoted to sub-homeroom teacher. She later regains her position as homeroom teacher when Makimura is promoted to a higher position. It is implied that Yukiji was once Ayumu's tutor who taught her how to play the guitar and later gave Ayumu her guitar. :In the extras of volume four of the manga, the author writes that before starting the Hayate no Gotoku! manga, he had created a one-shot manga where the story is about a female high-school student and her little sister trying to pay back an 80 million Yen debt, then writes that these characters are, in fact, Yukiji and Hinagiku. ; : :The adoptive mother of Yukiji and Hinagiku, she seems to have a fondness for Hinagiku. She is also attracted to Hayate due to his feminine looks, and tends to always want to make him to wear Hinagiku's unwanted clothes, much to her embarrassment. ; : :He is the former grade teacher of Yukiji who took her and Hinagiku into his household as their adoptive father when they paid off their debts. He is said to have a fondness for Yukiji. Nishizawa household ; : :Ayumu Nishizawa is a girl from Hayate's previous school before he became a butler and is usually seen with Hinagiku. She is currently 16 years old. She always had feelings for Hayate and is happy when he pays his old school a visit. It is revealed in Episode 10 of Season 2 that she fell in love with Hayate because he saved her from a bicycle crash. She violently lashes out at anyone who badmouths her and Hayate, including a teacher who called Hayate a dropout because his parents had refunded all his school fees the day Hayate was sold. She confesses her feelings to Hayate, but Hayate rejects them after getting a vision of Nagi. Undeterred, she tries to talk to Hayate when she sees him a week later, but she runs into Nagi. She is shocked that, in terms of metaphoric strength, Nagi is a dragon while she is a hamster. Nishizawa retreats, vowing next time to bring a stronger hamster. She later challenges Nagi to karaoke, only to lose. In the anime, it is a running gag that she appears in every episode, usually for less than 30 seconds, doing something entirely unrelated to the episode's plot, though always related to food. However, she who has successfully confessed her love towards Hayate, which often places her in situations where she is alone with him. Ayumu is friends with Wataru, from whom she often rents videos, and tested her chocolate on him before giving it to Hayate on Valentines Day. Another weird habit about her is that every time she buys a drink at the vending machine that responds with \\"Thank you very much\\", she would always say, \\"You are welcome\\". Currently, Ayumu also works part-time at Wataru's new video shop. :On May 15th, she believes Hayate has forgotten her birthday but in actual fact he and Nagi were planning a surprise party at the cafe the 3 worked at. She tries to get him to realise it is her birthday and him trying to keep the fact that he knows to a secret. Ayumu loses and leaves straight after her shift, Nagi convinces her to come back and she is greeted by Nagi, Hayate, Hinagiku and everyone else. While visiting the Violet Mansion, much to her dismay she learns that Ruka has become newest tenant. After seeing that Hinagiku is happy with her moving in and still seeing Ruka as a threat, Ayumu decides to rent out the last room in the Violet Mansion. When Christmas Eve comes again, Ayumu thought about Hayate and Athena, wondering she if could've made a difference. ; : :Kazuki Nishizawa is the younger brother of Ayumu and a friend of Wataru. Like Hayate, he has a feminine appearance. A year ago, Kazuki met Nagi crying in front of a cherry blossom tree and fell in love with her at first sight. He is also same age as Nagi. When he met her again in Wataru's store, he invited her to a walk and finally confessed his love to her. During their \\"date\\" she told him that she already loves someone else; and after he saw Hayate saving Nagi from falling in a lake, Kazuki realized it was Hayate she loves. But the date did not end on a low note because Nagi had finally come to remember her first meeting with Kazuki. He buys a manga that Nagi was handing out at a doujinshi convention (in chapter 293), technically Kazuki volunteer to help increase Wataru's marketing. ; :Yasuhiro is Ayumu and Kazuki's father. ; :She is the wife of Yasuhiro, and is Ayumu and Kazuki's mother. Segawa household ; : :Izumi Segawa is the student representative for Hayate's class at Haku≈ç Academy. She is the younger fraternal twin sister of Kotetsu Segawa. Her family owns the game company - SAMY (a parody of SONY). She met Hayate when they were younger (volume 17 flashback) as she was getting attacked by a dog and gave him a kiss for saving her, as well as telling him she would be his bride when they're older; although she mentioned nothing about that incident when she first met Hayate at Haku≈ç Academy, possibly due to both parties not remembering each other. Like her friends, she addresses Hayate as \\"Hayata\\". Izumi gets along well with Hayate, and is comfortable enough to even change clothes while he is in the same room (though not for him to actually watch her change). Later on, she realises to have feelings for Hayate; it is confirmed when he gives her 17th birthday cake. She calls herself as member \\"Red\\" of the Hakuou Three Amiga, and she mostly the protagonist among the group. ; : :Kotetsu Segawa is the combat butler of the Segawa family and the older fraternal twin brother of Izumi Segawa. As a running gag, his hobby is his extreme love of trains and train turntables. It seems that he has terrible luck with women that left him feeling bitter about the entire female gender, but while he is at Hinagiku's birthday party, he runs into Hayate and immediately falls in love with him, or rather his alter- ego Hermione. He soon learns of Hayate's identity from Izumi. Angered by this, he kidnaps Nagi in order to bring Hayate out. After Nagi confronts him on his shallow attitude towards love in general, he vows to change his attitude and still loves Hayate even after discovering that he is male. He seems extremely hung up on Hayate and uses various methods to try to spend time with him. Kotetsu is the only person whom Hayate really hates (besides his parents). ; :Stringer is Izumi and Kotetsu's father. He is very protective of Izumi, particularly against males, to the point that Izumi must smuggle Hayate in as a girl, though the truth is later revealed. He does not appear to care much for Kotetsu, betting his life against Hayate's in order to gain Izumi's hand in marriage. Asakaze household ; : :Risa Asakaze is the head of the disciplinary committee for Hayate's class at Haku≈ç Academy. She is often seen hanging around her friends Miki and Izumi. She speaks in a rather boyish manner and likes to cause trouble for fun, which is ironic since she is the head of the disciplinary committee. Her family lives in a giant Shinto shrine. She calls herself as member \\"Black\\" of the Hakuou Three Amiga. ; :A very old man whose age is unknown. He is a swordsman, and very forgetful person who quickly forgets what he has done a few seconds ago. Hibino household ; : :Fumi is a first-year student of Hakuou who is first seen when she leaves for Hakuou, and is usually seen alongside her close friend Sharna Alamgir. She parents' names are Makie and Kunimasa. She often makes hilarious remarks about other people, unusually high ability in mathematics, and is very gullible as well. She addresses Hinagiku as \\"visible panties person\\" when she first arrives and encounters Hinagiku standing on the branch of a tree rescuing a stranded cat, the same way Hayate did, and comments that she can see Hinagiku's panties. She later appears (in chapter 306) where she was reunited with her big dog, Armageddon, with the help of Athena and Hayate after it stumbled into the Violet mansion. She later fell in love with Hayate's brother upon meeting him at the beach in chapter 455. In the manga, Fumi expresses her wish to become the next president of the student council. According to the author, she is going to be the next future student council president of Hakuou, succeeding Hinagiku. ; :Armageddon is Fumi's dog, who usually goes around town to find free food. One day, he ended up at the Violet Mansion where he finds Alice (Athena) holding his favorite treat: a chocolate cornet. Later on, Armageddon grabbed Wataru's briefcase with 100 million yen then losses it to some bandits. Tama translates Armageddon where the money went; instead this escalates into an argument between the two animals. Fumi explains that the reason why he loves Alice is likely because her hair \\"drills\\" resemble chocolate cornets. Tennousu household ; : :Athena is an heir of the Tennousu family and is revealed to be one of the five directors in charge of Hakuou Academy in the manga. She has mainly appeared in the manga as the main heroine. She has been shown in the anime during a brief flashback where Hayate reflects on his first girlfriend. Her parents are presumed missing or dead, since she lived alone. She is Hayate's ex-girlfriend, as well as his first Mistress, whom he met 10 years ago. Since he was very young at that time, he called her \\"A-tan\\" („Ç¢„Éº„Åü„Çì ƒÄ-tan) for short. He lived with her for a while at her castle \\"Royal Garden\\". There she taught Hayate how to do house chores. She even taught him sword fighting. She also healed Hayate's body and reinforced it with some kind of spell, which could be the reason for Hayate's power. :Both of them cared deeply for each other, to the point in which they decided to spend their life together. That decision was taken after Hayate worked really hard to get a present for Athena. He was able to get her a ring. Right after he gave her that ring, she told him that engagement rings came in pairs, and so she took a ring from one of her pockets and gave it to Hayate, saying both of them would wear those rings when they grow up. After this event, Hayate was able to convince Athena to live with him and his parents, and once so he decided to finally confront his parents and tell them about this. At the beginning, it seemed things were heading into a positive direction, but his parents betrayed him once again, by pawning the ring he had received from Athena, which he had entrusted them. Until in chapter 469, Athena has found the ring from Yukiji and got it back. :By the time Hayate had returned to the Royal Garden, Athena had already seen the things Hayate and his parents had. Athena told Hayate not to see his parents again, telling them they were the worst kind of people. After a short, but heated discussion, Hayate told Athena she wouldn't be able to understand him, because she didn't have any parents. During their battle, Hayate notice a giant spectra with the shape of a skeleton. Apparently, Athena was completely unaware of its presence. Once the battle was over, Athena told Hayate he could leave. Immediately afterwards, Athena tried to call him back, but it was too late. Then, saddened because of Hayate's departure, she broke into tears, realizing she had ended up alone once again. After leaving the Royal Garden, Hayate began wandering in the streets aimlessly, as he was still deeply saddened because of his fight with Athena. Eventually and surprisingly, he met Ikusa, who told him to apologize. Hayate, following his brother's advice, tried to return but he could no longer reach the Royal Garden. At the end of volume 17, it was revealed that Mikado Sanzen'in, bought the land where the Royal Garden existed and built Haku≈ç Academy over it. :Athena and Hayate still dream about these events, even after 10 years. While Hayate expresses his longing to see Athena again. She referred to the dream as \\"extremely detestable\\", but then in her thoughts she said: \\"Even though I've cried my tears dry that day, you still appear in my dreams...\\" Athena's earliest appearance is (in chapter 88) when Hayate explains the reason he doesn't deserve to be a boyfriend to Hinagiku and the others. She then appears (in chapter 144) when Hayate remembers her after saying that he's not good with girls; in chapter 172, Hayate cries about her when Izumi asks him what his first girlfriend was like; realizing she was right all along about his parents. :In chapter 233, Hayate finally meets Athena after 10 years. Much to his surprise, she shows no signs of remembering him and kicks him out. Afterwards, she is shown calling out his name in private while blushing, revealing that she lied to him. Later, it is also revealed that she is also friends with Hinagiku, but didn't talk to her for a while because Hinagiku also gave her the same nickname \\"A-tan\\". In chapter 239, Hayate admits to Hinagiku (who was just about to confess to him) that he is in love with Athena. :After Hayate's fight with Machina she was the one who treated him and brought him into the mansion. Later, Hayate manages to confront Athena. A fight ensues, where a skeleton hand attacks Hayate wherein later Isumi arrives to aid Hayate and confirms that the skeleton hand is King Midas an honored spirit possessing Athena because of a deal. Hayate was left to decide to destroy the King's Jewel and save Athena, but Nagi will lose the Sanzenin inheritance. After Nagi crushes the King's Jewel herself and entrusts Hayate in protecting her in the future, Hayate determines and manages to rescue Athena from King Midas. After King Midas is destroyed, Athena originally intends to stay with Hayate, however she soon realizes that he cannot give up Nagi and so decides to part ways with him again (although on friendly terms this time), thereby by settling their argument from the past. She later meets Nagi returning her hat but at the same time telling her that next time she will not return it (she is referring to Hayate) and gives her the empty ring box that Hayate got her. Athena has since made a re-appearance in chapter 300 (both as the current and younger Athena). Athena then hands Hayate the ring then asks him to become her butler convincing him that she really is Athena. The key to regain it back was to stay with Hinagiku for at least 3 months (due to possessing the Shirosakura) at the Violet Mansion. :When the deadline draws near, Athena states that she will temporarily regain her original form thanks to a simplifying power on the grounds of Himegami's land - Violet Mansion. Athena proceed to recover Ikusa's memory as she expresses thankfully to him for his past actions. Athena later discovers that her original form and memories were sealed inside one of the King's Jewels, and once learning that said jewel is in Hisui's possession, he and Hayate confront her to retrieve it (chapter 546). In the occasion, Hisui destroys the jewel, restoring Athena to normal, just to confirm that the power of the jewels and their connection to the Royal Garden are true. As the fateful battle for King Midas' power abruptly began on Christmas Eve because of Nagi's wish, Hisui and Hayate trapped asleep in a realm Athena commissions at the Hakuou clock tower to counter it all by using a VR helmet (a NerveGear, from Sword Art Online) to make contact. After the battle, Athena is shown together with Machina. ; :Athena's butler. To date, he has only appeared in the manga. He appears to be slow on the uptake and is frequently called an idiot by his mistress, much to his chagrin. He loves hamburgers, but despite his small frame he was strong enough to lay a near fatal blow onto Hayate. He had also stated that he is not human, Machina seems to have the ability of superhuman strength just like Hayate does, he also has a hidden skill to transform himself into a giant serpent (which is his true form) with a jewel in its forehead. Machina gives Hinagiku the long white sword, Shirosakura to help Hayate save Athena. After the Golden Week arc, Machina is found at Sakuya's mansion (in chapter 408), and she feeds him food endlessly. Hatsushiba household ; :Hisui is Mikado's niece and Nagi's childhood friend, known for her boundless greed, thus Mikado intends to keep her from inheriting the Sanzenin fortune at all costs, fearing how much of a threat she would be with so much wealth at her disposal. It is shown in after the Doujinshi arc, she has Yozora as her loyal servant, spying on available candidates, such as Hayate, Ruka, and Nagi because Hisui plans to open the gateway and obtain the Power of Royalty that can only be done by a person's broken heart holding a King's Jewel, and she also has intel on Athena Tennousu. Hisui and Yozora were planning to use Ruka as the main candidate to gain access to Royal Garden due to her mistaking Hayate for a girl but she managed to overcome it, and is no longer available. Hisui will stop at nothing until she gets what she wants. When the battle concludes, Nagi decides to give Hisui the \\"Loto's Key\\" believing things will be settled later. Displease with Nagi's generosity, Hisui attacks Hayate's parents in retribution for how their greed had ruined her plans. She is the central antagonist competing in the manga series. ; : :Jenny is the younger sister of Hisui, and a friend of Nagi's; she appears in a flashback accompanying Nagi in Africa where they find Tama. Despite being four-years-old in the flashback, Jenny looks nothing like her age and carries a lighter in the shape of a rifle. She also claims to have ninja skills. ; :Yozora first appeared in chapter 285, after secretly launching a bottle rocket attack at Hayate as he attempted to transport Tama to the new apartment-house residence, Violet Mansion. She planned to rent a room there, but was rejected by Nagi due to her flirtatious ways with Hayate. Chapter 433 reveals that Yozora serves as a maid to Hisui. When a valuable photo of an old man is found in the Violet Mansion, she is given the mission to retrieve it, going so far as to conjure (apparently via magic) a couple of robots, culminating with her crashing Ruka's concert in order to retrieve said photo. She continues to spy on the Violet Mansion that Nagi and residents live in, and when Hayate, Linn and Tama discover the coffin from the Royal Garden in a formerly secret room of the building, Yozora attacks and is engaged by Isumi. Yozora's powers are strong enough to withstand Isumi's incredible powers. It's possible that Yozora's the daughter of King Midas who supposedly been turned into fossilize gold. Hakuou Academy :Hayate, Nagi, Isumi, Wataru/Kayura, Hinagiku, Izumi, Kotetsu, Risa, and Fumi attend Haku≈ç Academy. =Students= ; : :Chiharu Harukaze is the Secretary of the Student Council, known for her cold and serious personality. However, she seems to share Nagi's interest in anime and video games, but only shows this side of her to Nagi and Hayate. Secretly, she works as Sakuya's maid; she uses the alias Haru, when her father's company goes bankrupt, but nobody in the Haku≈ç Academy is aware of this, with the exception of Aika Kasumi. Chiharu may have a serious, hardworking nature. Currently she stays at the Violet Mansion as a tenant when her house caught fire while her parents were practicing making Motsunabe. And as a result has gotten close to Nagi due to the similar hobbies they have. Chiharu invited her to a doujinshi convention with hopes of restoring Nagi's \\"burning spirit\\". She introduced Nagi to the Author of the doujinshi \\"Flying Dolphin\\" that she helped sell, Ruka Suirenji. Ever since then, she has been helping Nagi to write and publish her own manga, going around with her to come up with ideas for it. Nagi gets close to Chiharu the point where she tells of her first meeting with Hayate, leading Chiharu to discover their true relationship. ; : :Kayura Tsurugino appears at the end of Chapter 336 of the manga as a replacement of Wataru Tachibana for Hakuou.

Hayate asked her to become an adviser for Nagi's manga, but she refused. Kayura reveals that before her family ran a small video game company, they were once assistants for a manga artist named Nikaku Hyouzan, then returned to Hokkaido. Kayura then later gave advice to Nagi, to not make a simple to understand manga like how Ruka and Hinagiku are doing, but to do the opposite, and make the manga the way she thinks its right, no matter of others' opinions. Kayura, Nagi, and Chiharu become very good friends. ; : :Miki Hanabishi is a member of the student council and the vice-representative for Hayate's class at Haku≈ç Academy.

Aika is often consider a \\"love master\\" for her excellent advice in dealing with females' pride. :Despite this, she does care about her friends and would never betray them. For example, when she learned that Chiharu was secretly working as a maid for Sakuya, she hid this secret from everyone despite the fact that she wrote it in down in her weakness notebook in order to remember it. She also has a pendant (King's Jewel) similar to Hayate's and Wataru's. She later appears in Myoknos, and gave advice to Hayate about Hinagiku and suggest him to have dinner with her in chapter 224. It is revealed later that she had some relationship with Athena. She also appears to have a fianc√©. ; : :Kotaro Azumamiya is the master of Kaede Nonohara and a member of the kendo club. He is 16 years old, same age as Hayate. He is considered the weakest member of the club because his strikes are random and dangerous. He has a vulgar mouth, which obligates Kaede to scold him accordingly in his duty to refine his master into a gentleman. When he is in trouble, he calls for Kaede to fight for him and, with exception to Hayate, always picks fights with those with the highest possibility of being weaker than he is. Out of jealousy, he challenges Hayate to a duel when he sees him being friendly with Hinagiku. He is often beaten up mercilessly by Kaede for his weaknesses. Recently, he has lost his self-esteem ever since Kaede went to study abroad in England. When going to Mt. Takao, he tried to recruit Hayate so he reminds him of Kaede's words of complimentary. He is the only character introduced so far whose endurance is worse than Nagi's. Recently, it has been shown that various members of his family are manga artists, and that he himself works as an assistant for Gouji Ashibashi. :He has a crush on Hinagiku (Episode 16, 27) and is jealous of Hayate simply because he called her \\"Hinagiku\\" instead of \\"Ms. Katsura\\". ; : :Himuro Saeki is the 17-year-old combat butler of the Ookouchi family. He is usually seen smelling a single rose or reading a book while his master throws rose petals behind him. Himuro loves money more than anything in the world, but he does not try to gain the Sanzen'in inheritance because he already has his master's money. Himuro robs Hayate of his necktie in their first meeting so Hayate gives him the nickname \\"necktie man\\" in the manga. In the anime, this nickname is changed to \\"Prince Necktie\\". :Like Klaus, he throws roses like daggers. He can also create a rose whip and can use a powerful move that involves striking the opponent with rose petals. He is very agile and is able to stand on the side of trees. Unfortunately, he has a glaring weakness against money. In fact, Klaus \\"defeats\\" him by offering him a large sum of money, and he strangely begins to bleed profusely as if struck immediately after. His ultimate attack has yet to be revealed. Despite being greedy, he does care for the well being of his master. ; : :Taiga is Himuro's master, but it is difficult to tell which one is the master and which one is the butler. Taiga follows Himuro around throwing rose petals creating a rose storm. He can be mistaken for a little girl at first due to his voice and appearance. Taiga's hairstyle changed in the anime. He does not have a short ponytail in the manga but gets one in later chapters. He is 10 years old.

During the Golden Week vacation, he and Yukiji went to Italy. While staying there, Kyonosuke confesses to Yukiji. ; : :Kirika Kuzuha is the Superintendent of Haku≈ç Academy who first appears asking Yukiji to tell Hayate that he had failed the entrance exam. In the anime, she possesses a power level three times that of an ordinary person, but the moment she uses all her energy, she drops to the floor until she consumes a lot of sweets. She tends to do extreme things to kill her boredom, going as far as to put sharks in the school pool and changing the school trip to the Amazon. Thus, she is an enemy to the students and the student council. She's also bisexual, having a fierce and romantic relationship with her female butler Shion, and being attracted to both Hayate and Hinagiku. This is due to both being good looking and cute, and the former's femininity and the latter's masculinity. :In the anime, Kirika and Shion are the antagonists manipulated by a J√∂rmungandr in Season 1 as guardians of the Amazon treasure (ancient butler robe) for unknown years. Hayate, with his newfound power, managed to defeat the J√∂rmungandr once and for all in episode 39. ; : :Shion, whose name is \\"poem\\" and \\"sound\\" in kanji, is a devoted butler of Kirika Kuzuha. She first faced Hayate after Kirika loses her energy while attacking him. She's also one of the reasons why Hayate joined the Butler Battle Tournament. She has an amazing aura, so much so that she can create her own \\"territory\\" (reminiscent of certain characters in Yu Yu Hakusho/Poltergeist Report). However, if her shoes are knocked off, she reverts to her real middle school child form, which is powerless. She pampers the superintendent with sweets and makes sure that she is always contented and happy. She does however seem to share the same sexual interest in girls and boys. =OB= ; : :Kaede Nonohara is the 18-year-old combat butler of the Azumamiya family. He appears to have white hair and an almost always smiling face. His eyes are always closed and he is very polite. He encourages his master to be a gentleman and to be manly enough to fight his own battles even if he were to lose. :In contrast with his gentle and polite exterior, Kaede is very brutal, senselessly beating his master when he acts like a weakling. In combat, whenever Kotaro asks for his help, he does the opposite, either throwing him into the battle zone or beating the boy up. Kaede is very quick and is able to do a Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku-like (hurricane kick) attack. His ultimate attack is the \\"Safety Shutter: Grand Explosion Immolating Dark Murder!\\", which is a fire attack released from the edge of his sword in the shape of a dragon that engulfs the opponent in flames. Kaede's only weakness is seeing his master getting hit by his own ultimate attack. Despite his ultimate attack being strong, he was defeated by Hayate in episode 19. :Currently Kaede has graduated and left for England to continue his butler studies. Shiomi High School :Ayumu also attends Shiomi High School. ; : :Souya is one of Hayate and Ayumu's friends who attends Hayate's previous high school, Shiomi.

During Hayate's and the other's trip to Mykonos, Sonia attempted to steal the King's Jewel from Hayate. It seemed that she was either in collaboration with Gilbert Kent or she simply used him. Sonia attacked Hayate with the use of seduction. During their fight, Ayumu was nearby causing Hayate to panic if she misunderstood the situation. Taking advantage of the opportunity Sonia took the pendant and ran to her home but Ayumu who earlier met Sonia was told where her home was located. Ayumu and Hayate arrived in her home and Hayate told Sonia to give up. However Sonia refused and threatened to destroy the stone so that no one will get the inheritance. Sonia originally wanted the stone to use the inheritance to make her chances of ending up with Wataru better.

He was created to be the ultimate nursing robot by the Sanzen'in Technology Division. He is waterproof and equipped with \\"nursing missiles\\" and rocket boosters. Eight's downfall is his quick temper. He snaps after being called \\"ugly\\" and seeks revenge after he is defeated. Through his dialogue, he reveals that he only desires revenge in order to prove himself to the one he loves: his creator.

The morphological classification of this galaxy is (R)SAB(s)a, which indicates a spiral galaxy with a weak-bar around the nucleus (SAB), no ring around the bar (s), an outer ring (R), and tightly-wound spiral arms (a). It is inclined by an angle of 57¬∞ to the line of sight from the Earth, with the long axis oriented at a position angle of 324¬∞. The disk of gas and stars shows a noticeable warp, and there is a pronounced asymmetry in the distribution of neutral hydrogen and H II regions. The core region contains a suspected weak active galactic nucleus plus a circumnuclear ring containing star clusters and supernova remnants at a distance of from the center. These form a ring of peculiar \\"hot spots\\". It was formerly identified as a possible Seyfert galaxy, but evidence now points to starburst activity in a radius around the center. A probable outflow of gas is directed to the north-east from the nucleus, forming prominent dust lanes. The high level of star formation in this galaxy and the nearby NGC 1792 may indicate a recent, distant tidal interaction between the two.

One of the singer‚Äôs most famous publicity stunts was to become known as the ‚Äúmost painted woman in the world‚Äù. She posed for some of the most celebrated artists of the day including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, Tamara de Lempicka, Marie Laurencin, Francis Picabia and Kees van Dongen. Her stipulation for sitting was that she would be given the paintings to hang in her club, and, by this time, she had accumulated thirty-three portraits of herself. La Vie Parisienne became one of the trendiest night spots in Paris. Solidor's most famous portrait was painted by Tamara de Lempicka. Solidor met Tamara de Lempicka sometime in the early 1930s, and Suzy asked the artist to paint her. Tamara agreed, but only if she could paint Solidor in the nude. Solidor agreed, and the painting was finished in 1933. During the occupation, her nightclub was popular with German officers; in 1941 she recorded a version of the song \\"Lili Marleen\\" with French words by Henri Lemarchand.Path√©: Discography After the war she was convicted by the √âpuration l√©gale as a collaborator. She died on 30 March 1983 in Cagnes-sur-Mer and is buried in the town. She was the subject of the song \\"Sad Songs\\" by the English group The Christians in their eponymous first album.

The highway travels east as the Kent-Des Moines Road and the Kent-Kangley Road from a concurrency with SR 509 in Des Moines through Kent and Covington to an intersection with SR 169 in Maple Valley. SR 516, designated as part of the National Highway System within Kent, intersects three major freeways in the area: Interstate 5 (I-5) in western Kent, SR 167 in downtown Kent, and SR 18 in Covington. The roadway, built in the 1890s, was codified in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 1K (SSH 1K) from Des Moines to Kent and SSH 5A from Kent to Maple Valley. The two highways were combined during the 1964 highway renumbering to form SR 516 on its current route. Route description I-5 southbound approaching its interchange with SR 516 in Kent. SR 516 begins in Des Moines at Marine View Drive as SR 509 turns north towards Burien near the East Passage of Puget Sound. The two concurrent highways travel east on the Kent-Des Moines Road past Highline Community College and Mount Rainier High School to an intersection with SR 99 in western Kent, where SR 509 turns south towards Tacoma. Shortly thereafter, SR 516 intersects I-5 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and continues east onto a four-lane divided highway over the Green River and its pedestrian and bicycle trail into downtown Kent. The highway serves as the southern terminus of SR 181 before intersecting SR 167 in a diamond interchange at the western edge of downtown Kent. SR 516 shifts south onto Willis Street and crosses the Interurban Trail and a BNSF rail line before turning north onto Central Avenue and east onto Smith Street near Kent Station. The highway travels southeast along Mill Creek onto the Kent-Kangley Road and serves as the southern terminus of SR 515 at Kent-Meridian High School before leaving Kent for Covington. SR 516 passes Lake Meridian as 272nd Street and intersects SR 18 at a diamond interchange located in Covington. The highway continues east past Pipe Lake and into Maple Valley before crossing the Cedar to Green River Trail and ending at an intersection with SR 169. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of the highway was between SR 181 and the SR 167 interchange, serving 38,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section was its western terminus at SR 509, serving 8,900 vehicles. SR 516 between I-5 and SR 167 within western Kent is designated as part of the National Highway System, which includes roadways important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. History The Kent-Kangley Road was built as a wagon road by King County by the late 1890s and was upgraded to a paved highway after being codified as two highways during the creation of the primary and secondary state highways system in 1937: SSH 1K and SSH 5A. SSH 1K traveled south from U.S. Route 99 and Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) through Burien and east through Des Moines to US 99 and PSH 1 in Midway. SSH 5A traveled east from US 99 and PSH 1 in Midway across the Green River into Kent, intersecting SSH 5M, PSH 5, and SSH 5C, before ending at the Enumclaw-Renton branch of PSH 5 in Maple Valley. The two highways were combined during the 1964 highway renumbering to form SR 516 and codified into law in 1970. The highway traveled east from SR 509 in Des Moines through I-5 at Midway, SR 167 in Kent, and SR 18 in Covington to SR 169 in Maple Valley. SR 509 was re-aligned in 1991 onto SR 516 and SR 99, forming new concurrencies, until the completion of a new north-south freeway.

His father was Aron Bernstein (1812-- 1884), a founder of the Reform Judaism Congregation in Berlin 1845; his son was the mathematician Felix Bernstein (1878--1956).  Academic career  He studied medicine at the University of Breslau under Rudolf Heidenhain (1834-1897), and at the University of Berlin with Emil Du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896). He received his medical degree at Berlin in 1862, and two years later began work in the physiological institute at the University of Heidelberg as an assistant to Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894). In 1872 he succeeded Friedrich Goltz (1834-1902) as professor of physiology at the University of Halle, where in 1881 he founded an institute of physiology.Short biography, bibliography, and links on digitized sources in the Virtual Laboratory of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science Differential rheotome, used by Bernstein to measure action potentials  Contributions  Bernstein's work was concentrated in the fields of neurobiology and biophysics. He is largely recognized for his \\"membrane hypothesis\\" in regards to the origin of the \\"resting potential\\" and the \\"action potential\\" in the nerve.Geocities.com Short biography Bernstein (1902, 1912) correctly proposed that excitable cells are surrounded by a membrane selectively permeable to K+ ions at rest and that during excitation the membrane permeability to other ions increases. His \\"membrane hypothesis\\" explained the resting potential of nerve and muscle as a diffusion potential set up by the tendency of positively charged ions to diffuse from their high concentration in cytoplasm to their low concentration in the extracellular solution while other ions are held back. During excitation, the internal negativity would be lost transiently as other ions are allowed to diffuse across the membrane, effectively short- circuiting the K+ diffusion potential. In the English-language literature, the words \\"membrane breakdown\\" were used to describe Bernstein's view of excitation. (From Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes, Third Edition, by Bertil Hille). Bernstein's pioneering research laid the groundwork for experimentation on the conduction of the nerve impulse, and eventually the transmission of information in the nervous system. He is credited with invention of a \\"differential rheotome\\", a device used to measure the velocity of bio-electric impulses.Seyfarth E-A.

Its kaleidoscopic camerawork, film noir atmosphere, lighting and design aspects, Kafkaesque paranoia, philosophical themes and Beatty's performance in the title role turned the film into a cult classic. Penn and Surgal ignored the usual conventions of narrative for a freewheeling approach to their dramatic devices and Chicago locations. Plot After incurring the wrath of the Mafia, a stand-up comic (Warren Beatty) flees Detroit for Chicago, taking the name Mickey One (from the Greek ethnic name Mikolas Ongeoffery on a Social Security card he steals from a homeless man). He uses the card to get a job at a seedy diner hauling garbage. Eventually he returns to the stage as a stand-up comic, but is wary of becoming successful, afraid that he will attract too much attention. When he gets a booking at the upscale club Xanadu, he finds that his first rehearsal has become a special \\"audition\\" for an unseen man with a frightening, gruff voice (Aram Avakian). Paranoid that the mob has found him, Mickey runs away. He decides to find out who \\"owns\\" him and square himself with the mob. However, he doesn't know what he did to anger them or what his debt is. Searching for a mobster who will talk to him, he gets beaten up by several nightclub doormen. Mickey finally concludes that it's impossible to get away and be safe, so he pulls himself together and does his act anyway. In traveling about the city, Mickey continually sees a mute mime-like character known only as The Artist (Kamatari Fujiwara). The Artist eventually unleashes his Rube Goldberg-like creation, a deliberately self-destructive machine called \\"Yes,\\" an homage to the sculptor Jean Tinguely.Crowther, Bosley. \\"Heels Old and New,\\" The New York Times, September 9, 1965.

The film was a commercial flop. Beatty and Penn did not get along while making this film. Beatty later recalled, \\"We had a lot of trouble on that film, because I didn't know what the hell Arthur was trying to do and I tried to find out ... I'm not sure that he knew himself\\" and added, \\"To me, the stand-up gags that the guy had to do in Mickey One were not funny and that was always my complaint with Arthur.\\" Producer Harrison Starr recalled, \\"Warren and Arthur had go-arounds ... the role was basically a role of an eccentric, a person whose inner demons were reflected in the world he inhabited ... and I think that was difficult for Warren to play.\\"TCM.com Nevertheless, Beatty and Penn soon teamed again for Bonnie and Clyde in 1967. =Rediscovery= The rediscovery of the film began in 1995 with a booking at San Francisco's Castro Theater and a reevaluation by Peter Stack: Soundtrack : The soundtrack was arranged by Eddie Sauter and performed by tenor saxophonist Stan Getz.

Born in Selby, Yorkshire, England, Cawthray was a right-handed batsman, who scored 114 first- class runs at an average of 19.00, with a best of 30 against Glamorgan. He took four wickets with his right arm medium pace at 76.00 each, three of these coming in his last match against Derbyshire. He played for the Yorkshire Second XI in 1938 and 1939. He played for Brayton School from 1924 to 1927, once taking five wickets in five balls, and represented Selby Schools in the Yorkshire Shield. He played for Brayton village side from 1928, along with Cawood and Selby Londesborough, before joining Hull Cricket Club where, from 1938 to 1959, he scored 8,384 runs at 29.30, and took 872 wickets at 12.91. In 1946, he was appointed groundsman/professional at Hull C.C., and took a similar post at Headingley in 1964. He was stated to have scored 30,000 runs, and taken 3,000 wickets during a long successful career which was interrupted by World War II, during which he was a glider pilot. Early on 19 August 1975, Cawthray discovered that campaigners calling for the release from prison of George Davis, had dug holes in the pitch and poured oil over one end of the wicket.

The musical debut of the now actor Diego Bertie was in 1986 when he was a student of the Universidad del Pacifico. He joined his class teammates Aurelio Garcia Mir√≥, Dante Albertini and Hernan Campos; they initiated the band when they were in High School, and they called it Im√°genes. Before Diego sang vocals, the lead singer was the well recognized Peruvian Chef, Gast√≥n Acurio. He left the band because he went to Spain to study, but the other 3 members kept the band alive and Diego joined to make it real. At the end of 1986, they recorded their first song and first hit, \\"Los Buenos Tiempos\\". It was a hit during summer of 1987. A curious thing is that Im√°genes did hardly any concerts. Their concerts can be \\"counted with the fingers\\" because for its members Im√°genes was only a hobby. The most important concert was when they opened the show to Hombres G, when the performed at Colegio San Agust√≠n in October 1987. In August, 1988 they released their first and only LP called Nuestra Versi√≥n, which contained the hit songs \\"Los Buenos Tiempos\\", \\"Caras Nuevas\\", \\"Una Vez M√°s\\", \\"M√°s Humano\\", \\"Sacamos Las Fotos\\" and \\"Qui√©n Llora\\". In June, 1988 they released \\"Caras Nuevas\\", their new single which also became a hit in Per√∫, this single had a very successful video-clip. In Nuestra Versi√≥n, Roxana Valdivieso participates in two songs: \\"Sacamos las fotos\\", performed by Roxana and Diego and \\"M√°s Humano\\", where she sang in the chorus of the songs. Jean Pierre Magnet also participated playing the saxophone in the songs \\"Quien llora\\" and \\"No s√© que voy a hacer\\". In 1988 they released the 3rd single \\"Una Vez M√°s\\", this song was a very successful hit as \\"Los Buenos Tiempos\\" and \\"Caras Nuevas\\" were. In December, 1988, Im√°genes dissolved because not one of the members worked hard enough to make the band live, because they were dedicated to other things, like acting as in the case of Diego. In 3 years together, Im√°genes had three successful hits and 3 videoclips, being a very influential band. In 1989, Diego attempted to begin a solo career. In the 90's, Diego's acting career was very successful, and he was acting in a lot of novels and Mini-series. In 1997 Diego released \\"Fuego Azul\\", his only solo album with the hits songs \\"Que Dificil Es Amar\\" which had an awesome video-clip, \\"El Fuego Que No Ves\\" and \\"La Noche\\", he did a lot of presentations in \\"La Noche de Barranco, but his priority was his successful acting career. In 1999, Im√°genes reunited for one an only last concert after 11 years since the band's break-up. The concert was held at the Hard Rock Cafe of Lima, and it was a very nostalgic concert, because all members were already out of the music business and focusing on other priorities. All Im√°genes fans were there, and they performed all their songs. After this last concert Im√°genes never reunited again.

It comprises the original Mumong settlement, as well as the Mumong public housing estate of the Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme. However, it officially consists of two village subdivisions, namely Mumong 'A' and Mumong 'B', which are under the mukim of Kuala Belait.  Name  Mumong is officially known in Malay as ( is sometimes spelt as ), which means 'Mumong Village'. Geography Mumong is located in the eastern part of Kuala Belait. It is surrounded by the suburb of Pandan to the north and north- west, the settlement of Panaga to east, and Belait River to the south. Mumong comprises the original Mumong village as well as Mumong Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme; they make up the eastern and western parts of Mumong respectively.Mumong location in Mukim Belait History Mumong was a small Malay village on the banks of the Belait River further upstream from Kuala Belait on the way to Kuala Balai. The development of Kuala Belait at the turn of the century as the district capital and the construction of Jalan Singa Menteri and Jalan Tengah to like Kuala Belait to Seria saw the village grow south of Jalan Singa Menteri to become mainly a commuter community serving Kuala Belait and Seria towns. The construction of the Seria Bypass in the 1980s further encouraged more settlement of the area as it provided a second link from the village to Kuala Belait and Seria. The government of Brunei has also continued to improve the area with the construction of the Mumong Resettlement Area, a Landless Housing Scheme area located to the west of the kampong. Other infrastructure constructed in the kampong includes the Mumong Youth Centre and Sports Complex in the 1990s which also serves the communities in the vicinity of Kuala Belait and Panaga, and the Kuala Belait Sewerage Treatment plant. Mumong also lends its name to the Mumong Telephone exchange area, although the physical location of the exchange is in Kampong Pandan.  Administration  The area of Mumong is officially administered as two villages, namely Mumong 'A' and Mumong 'B' (formerly known as Mumong Utara and Mumong Selatan respectively), which are the third- and lowest-level administrative divisions of Brunei. They are among the subdivisions within Kuala Belait, a mukim (subdistrict) in Belait District. Mumong 'A' comprises the Mumong public housing estate, as well as the nearby government residential area; Mumong 'B' makes up the Mumong village settlement. The two areas are also designated as postcode areas, thus having the postcodes KA1531 and KA1731 respectively. The community of each village subdivision is headed by a village head (). However, at present the village head position for Mumong 'B' is vacant, thus in the interim it is administered by the village head of Mumong 'A' and the position is currently held by Mohd Yusof bin Dulamin. Mumong has also been incorporated into the municipality of Kuala Belait. It comprises the entire Mumong 'A' and parts of Mumong 'B'.  Infrastructure  = Housing = Mumong Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme () is the public housing estate in Mumong and one of such estates in the country under the programme of its namesake, which is a government housing programme specifically for the or the indigenous citizens of Brunei. =Transport= Most of the roads within the kampong is surfaced. However, not all the roads are level to encourage effective drainage during a downpour. The main road passing through the heart of the old village is Jalan Mumong, although this road has been bisected by into two by the Seria Bypass. The Seria Bypass and Jalan Singa Menteri links Mumong west to Kuala Belait and from there to Miri in Malaysia, and east to Seria and from there to Tutong and Bandar Seri Begawan. A road connects Mumong to Kuala Balai - this road bears the name of Jalan Mumong - Kuala Balai, and this is the only road linking Kuala Balai to the rest of the country. This road was only surfaced in the 1990s, and has since seen a large number of industrial developments at the Mumong end.The residential developments are in the Mukim Seria section of the road There are no public buses serving the Mumong area. There are no Ferry services, river services or port services in Mumong. The nearest port is in neighbouring Kampong Sungai Duhon to the west along the Belait River, and the nearest deepwater port in Brunei is Muara Port. There are no airports in Mumong. Commercial travellers would have to travel to either Bandar Seri Begawan or Miri to catch a commercial flight. =Miscellaneous= Mumong Sports Complex serves as the main public venue for sports and recreational activities in Mumong and the area around the vicinity of Kuala Belait. It contains a running track, a swimming pool, various sports courts and other facilities.

Long was the son of Walter Long (ca. 1623 ‚Äì ca. 1699) of Bristol and South Wraxhall and his wife Barbara Brayfield. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford on 1 April 1664, aged 15. He inherited the Wraxhall estate from his father in 1699. Long's Wiltshire property meant he could put himself forward as a candidate at Calne at the first general election of 1701, when he was returned as Member of Parliament in a contest. He was probably supported by Henry Blaake, an outgoing member. He was inactive in the House and on 10 May he was granted leave of absence for an unspecified period. At the second general election in November 1701, he withdrew when Blaake stood again as a candidate. He was High Sheriff of Wiltshire for the year 1703 to 1704. Long's grandfather John Long (ca. 1585‚Äì1636) was disinherited by his father, Sir Walter Long (1565‚Äì1610) of South Wraxall and Whaddon, by the contrivances of the latter's second wife Catherine n√©e Thynne (a daughter of the first Sir John Thynne of Longleat) but a compromise later led John to receiving South Wraxall, and his brother the manor of Draycot. South Wraxall eventually passed to Walter Long, who died unmarried on 16 July 1731. He is buried at South Wraxall, near Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. He left all his property in Somerset, Wiltshire and Gloucestershire to John Long, a nephew of his cousin Hope Long.

This thermosetting plastic material is made from melamine and formaldehyde. In its butylated form, it is dissolved in n-butanol and xylene. It is then used to cross-link with alkyd, epoxy, acrylic, and polyester resins, used in surface coatings. There are many types, varying from very slow to very fast curing. It was discovered by William F. Talbot, who applied to patent it on December 12, 1936. Curing Melamine-formaldehyde can be cured by heating, which induces dehydration and crosslinking. The crosslinking can be carried out to a limited degree to give resins. Either the melamine- formaldehyde resins or melamine-formaldehyde \\"monomer\\" can be cured by treatment with any of several polyols.  Applications  = Construction material = The principal use of melamine resin is as the main constituent of high-pressure laminates, such as Formica and Arborite, and of laminate flooring. Melamine-resin tile wall panels can also be used as whiteboards. Melamine formaldehyde is used in plastic laminate and overlay materials. Formaldehyde is more tightly bound in melamine-formaldehyde than it is in urea-formaldehyde, reducing emissions. =Other= In the kitchen A melamine-resin plate ladle Melamine resin is often used in kitchen utensils and plates (such as Melmac). Melamine resin utensils and bowls are not microwave safe. During the late 1950s and 1960s melamine tableware became fashionable. Aided by the stylish modern designs of A. H. Woodfull and the Product Design Unit of British Industrial Plastics, it was thought to threaten the dominant position of ceramics in the market. In the late 1960s the tendency of melamine cups and plates to stain and scratch led to a decline in sales, and eventually the material became largely restricted to the camping and nursery market.  Cabinet and furniture making  Melamine resin is often used to saturate decorative paper that is laminated under heat and pressure and then pasted onto particle board; the resulting panel, often called melamine, is commonly used in ready-to-assemble furniture and kitchen cabinets. Melamine is available in diverse sizes and thicknesses, as well as a large number of colors and patterns. The sheets are heavy; the resin is prone to chipping when being cut with conventional table saws. Production and structure Melamine-formaldehyde resin forms via the condensation of formaldehyde with melamine to give, under idealized conditions, the hexa- hydroxymethyl derivative. Upon heating in the presence of acid, this or similar hydroxymethylated species undergoes further condensation and crosslinking. Linkages between the heterocycles include mono-, di-, and polyethers. The microstructure of the material can be analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.David R. Bauer \\"Melamine/formaldehyde crosslinkers: characterization, network formation and crosslink degradation\\" Progress in Organic Coatings 1986, Volume 14, pp. 193‚Äì218. The crosslinking density of melamine resins can be controlled by co-condensation with bifunctional analogues of melamine, such as benzoguanamine and acetoguanamine.

The regiment was formed in November 1942 as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force by amalgamating a number of previously existing armoured units and was disbanded in September 1946 after seeing action in New Guinea and Bougainville Island, where it provided individual squadron-group sized elements which operated in support of infantry operations against the Japanese. During its service the regiment received 10 battle honours. History The 2/4th Armoured Regiment was one of the last armoured units raised by the Australian Army during the war, being formed in order to replace the 2/6th Armoured Regiment which had been detached from the 1st Armoured Division to serve in New Guinea.Handel 2003, p. 151. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel D.A Cameron,Hopkins 1978, p. 318. the regiment was raised in November 1942 from elements of a number of Australian armoured reconnaissance units, including 'D' Squadron of the 2/11th Armoured Car Regiment and the 2/1st and 2/2nd Light Tank Squadrons,Hopkins 1978, p. 104. and was concentrated at Wee Waa, New South Wales. Initially, the regiment formed part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade of the 3rd Armoured Division and was equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks and M3 Stuart light tanks. At the beginning of 1943, the regiment was relocated to Manumbah in Queensland, travelling over from Narabri to their final destination near Murgon. The move north was punctuated by heavy rain that turned the road into a quagmire that was meant that at times the tank transporters had to be towed by the tanks that they were supposed to be transporting.Hopkins 1978, p. 109. Upon reaching their destination they commenced training and would remain in Queensland for the best part of a year. In October 1943, however, the 3rd Armoured Division was disbanded and the 2/4th was allocated to the 4th Armoured Brigade, an independent armoured brigade, and was re-equipped with Matilda II tank which were better suited for jungle warfare than the Grant and Stuart tanks. In August 1944, after training at Southport on the Gold Coast, the regiment received orders to deploy overseas and was moved to Madang in New Guinea, where it replaced the 1st Tank Battalion. Deployed to provide support to the Australian Army infantry units fighting the Japanese, the regiment provided a number of elements‚Äîorganised into squadron-group sized elements each with its own support units‚Äîto different infantry formations and the first element of the regiment to see action was the 'C' Squadron Group which was attached the 6th Division during the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign from November 1944;Hopkins 1978, p. 140. in doing so, they took part in the advance towards Wewak, the capture of Niap in January 1945 followed by the capture of Wewak in May. In April, the tanks moved to the town of But in April and from there, the squadron's tanks supported further actions along the Hawain River and around the Wirui Mission. By the end of the war they had occupied Boram.McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2476. Elsewhere, in December 1944, the 'B' Squadron Group was sent to Bougainville Island to support the Australian II Corps during the Bougainville Campaign.Long 1963, p. 183. This squadron first saw action on 31 March 1945, when it played an important role in supporting the 3rd Division during the Battle of Slater's Knoll.Maitland 1999, p. 145.Hopkins 1978, p. 146. The Regimental Headquarters and the 'A' Squadron Group were also sent to Bougainville in May 1945 and the regiment continued to provide support to the Australian infantry until the Japanese surrender taking part in a number of battles during the advance towards Buin in the southern sector, including the fighting around the Hongorai River and the crossings of the Hari and Mivo Rivers.Hopkins 1978, pp. 147‚Äì155.

Following the end of the war a detachment from the regiment was deployed to Rabaul to assist with guarding the 100,000 Japanese troops in the region. As the regiment's numbers were gradually reduced due to the demobilisation process, the 2/4th Armoured Regiment returned to Australia in May 1946 and was finally disbanded in September 1946. During the course of the unit's war service it suffered 25 men killed in action or died on active service and 31 wounded. Members of the 2/4th received the following decorations: one Distinguished Service Order, three Military Crosses, two Orders of the British Empire, three Military Medal and seven Mentioned in Despatches.Handel 2003, p. 152.

In 1896 Johnson became a state court judge in Utah's Seventh Judicial District. His judicial duties took him traveling throughout southeastern Utah until 1905. Active in Republican Party politics, Johnson was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1912. That year Utah had just been granted its second congressional seat. Incumbent Joseph Howell was re-elected, and Johnson was elected as Utah's new representative to the 63rd United States Congress. He served one term in Congress, failing to win the nomination in 1914. Johnson retired from politics to continue his law practice in Salt Lake City, where he died in 1925. The Jacob Johnson house and barn still stand in Spring City.

Named for Blanco County, Texas, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-344 was laid down on 18 October 1942 by the Norfolk Navy Yard; launched on 15 December 1942; sponsored by Mrs. H. H. Ward; and commissioned on 14 January 1943 with, Lieutenant Maurice G. Jackson, USNR, in command. Service history =Invasion of Italy, 1943-1944= The tank landing ship conducted shakedown and amphibious training in Chesapeake Bay until early April. On 2 April, she sailed for New York. There she loaded and took on passengers before sailing in convoy on the 28th for the Mediterranean. LST-344 arrived in Arzeu, Algeria on 26 May and began preparations for the Allied invasion of Sicily. At the end of the first week in July, the ship staged through Algiers as a unit of Task Force (TF) 81 (Dime Force) on her way to the southeastern coast of Sicily. She and her colleagues arrived off Gela around 0100 on the morning of 10 July. LST-344, however, did not approach the beach at H-hour, 0245. Instead, she remained well offshore until mid-morning. During that time, several German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter bombers tried unsuccessfully to skip bomb her. After she linked up with the causeway at Gela, several shore batteries tried to pepper her but, like the aircraft, scored no direct hits. Those bombardments only spattered her with shell fragments wounding two soldiers but causing no major damage to the ship. The tank landing ship completed unloading at about 1230, retracted from beach and causeway, and headed seaward. She remained about two miles offshore until 12 July when she headed for Bizerte, Tunisia to begin a series of reinforcement shuttles between North Africa and Sicily. The ship made five additional beachings at Gela between 12 July and the first week in September. On 7 September LST-344 sailed from Bizerte as a unit of TF 85, the Northern Attack Force for the assault at Salerno and arrived off her destination on 9 September. She did not beach on the day of the initial assault, but rather remained well off shore parrying sporadic German air attacks. On the 10th, however, she moved onto Red Beach and completed unloading in 90 minutes. Immediately thereafter, she shaped a course back to Bizerte where she arrived on 12 September. Once again, she made five more reinforcement voyages from Bizerte to Salerno and Taranto between mid-September and 19 October. After that, she made supply runs between Bizerte, Tripoli, and Algerian ports. =Invasion of France, 1943-1945= On 22 November the ship departed Algeria on her way to Great Britain. She arrived at Plymouth, England on 5 December. LST-344 began preparations for the Normandy Invasion. For the next six months, she conducted amphibious training at various locations throughout the British Isles. The tank landing ship departed Southampton during the late afternoon of 5 June 1944 in a convoy bound for Baie de la Seine, France. On D-Day, 6 June, she disembarked troops and unloaded vehicles and equipment at Omaha Beach. Late that night, she started back to Southampton to pick up additional men and equipment. The ship went to general quarters at 2320 to ward off an attack by Junkers Ju 88 bombers, and reported having helped to splash one of the attackers. The tank landing ship returned to Southampton safely on 7 June. For the next 10 months, LST-344 shuttled back and forth across the English Channel, first to the invasion beaches and, later, to the various French Channel ports after they had been captured and reopened. =Return to the US, 1945-1946= She departed Le Havre for the last time on 31 March 1945. The ship visited Southampton, Falmouth, and Plymouth in England, as well as Belfast in Northern Ireland. On 5 May she departed the latter port and shaped a course for the United States. LST-344 entered port at Norfolk, Virginia on 31 May. However, was underway again on 4 June on her way to New York and an overhaul at Sullivan's Shipyard in Brooklyn. The tank landing ship returned to Norfolk on 28 August, a fortnight after Japan capitulated, and spent the next three weeks training in Chesapeake Bay. After another visit to New York between 20 and 27 September, the ship headed south to Florida for inactivation. LST-344 arrived in Green Cove Springs, Florida on 30 September 1945 though she was not finally decommissioned and placed in reserve until 7 June 1946. =Mediterranean, 1951-1956= Late in 1951, the tank landing ship was moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to prepare for a return to active service. LST-344 was recommissioned at Norfolk on 5 January 1952 with Lieutenant John W. Wright, USNR, in command. After shakedown training in Chesapeake Bay, the ship stood out of Norfolk on 19 July with cargo bound for Port Lyautey in French Morocco. LST-344 returned to Norfolk from North Africa on 26 August. The four years following her return to active service saw a number of voyages to carry cargo to locations in the West Indies, North Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea. She also participated in several amphibious exercises during that period. Also during that time on 1 July 1955 the tank landing ship was named USS Blanco County (LST-344). On 28 February 1956 she was placed out of commission again and consigned to the reserve fleet at Green Cove Springs. =Vietnam War, 1965-1969= Late in 1965, Blanco County was moved to Baltimore to undergo another reactivation overhaul at the Bethlehem Shipbuilding & Drydock Company. Early in June 1966 she went to Little Creek, Virginia where she was recommissioned on 9 June 1966 with Lieutenant Bernard E. Burgett in command. The tank landing ship spent several weeks in refresher training before departing Little Creek on 24 August on her way to the Far East. Steaming via Charleston, the Panama Canal, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Guam, the ship arrived in Da Nang, South Vietnam in November. On the 26th, she reported for duty with TF 115 for service in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of waterborne logistics to the insurgent forces in South Vietnam. She alternated service along the coast of Vietnam with periods spent in other locations in the western Pacific, notably in the Philippines, at Guam, in Japan, and at Taiwan. On 10 October 1967 Blanco County began her first tour of duty as a supply ship to the small craft and monitors of the Mobile Riverine Force. That service lasted until December 1967 when she voyaged to Guam for an overhaul. The repairs lasted until 3 March 1968. On the 4th, the tank landing ship got underway for Japan. By 19 April she was back in Vietnam supplying American bases in the Mekong Delta. Blanco County continued to serve in Vietnam for over a year. She alternated tours of duty on \\"Operation Market Time\\" and base resupply missions with periods of upkeep at Subic Bay and Guam as well as rest and relaxation visits to numerous Far Eastern ports. =Decommissioning and sale, 1969-1975= She returned to the United States during the summer of 1969 to begin preparations for inactivation. Decommissioned on 3 October 1969 the tank landing ship was berthed at Orange, Texas. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1974; and she was sold to W. L. Weeks in July 1975, apparently for scrapping. Blanco County earned three battle stars during World War II as LST-344, and the Navy Unit Commendation and five battle stars for service during the Vietnam War as Blanco County (LST-344).

Bourret was educated at the Classical College at Nicolet, Quebec. After clerking for three years for his uncle, Bourret was admitted to the bar in 1823. He practiced law at his uncle's office for ten years. When his uncle died, he entered into a partnership with a well known lawyer, Toussaint Pelletier. He was appointed to the city council by the colonial government in 1840. He was elected councilor for the Centre Quarter in 1842 and the Quartier St. Antoine from 1846 until 1852. (At that time, municipal politicians often served in the provincial legislature). Bourret was the third (1842-1844) and sixth (1847-1849) mayor of Montreal, Quebec, and served as minister of public works in the Lafontaine-Baldwin government. Bourret also served on the legislative council of Canada from 1848 until his death in 1859. Bourret was supported by Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine because as a moderate, he was acceptable to the rich Anglo-Saxons who formed the majority of the Montreal electorate. While Lafontaine and Bourret supported responsible government, they provided a more moderate option than the radicals that led the Rebellions of 1837. Bourret also worked to preserve the French-Canadian identity. In 1843, he and Ludger Duvernay restored the mutual aid organization that became the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. He later served as the fifth president (1848-1849). He was also a co-founder of one of French Canada's earliest financial institutions, Banque d‚Äô√âpargne de la Cit√© et du District de Montr√©al. The bank was established to serve working-class Quebecers and had the strong support of the Roman Catholic Church. During his time as mayor, Montreal was the capital of the Province of Canada (see Union of Upper and Lower Canada). Therefore, Bourret bestowed the Saint Anne Market Building to the Parliament of the Canadas. Bourret was instrumental in the construction of the Bonsecours Market and the aqueducts into Montreal. He became an advocate for a safe water system after a cholera outbreak during his second term as mayor. Personal life Bourret was born in Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec on 10 June 1802 to farmer Joseph Bourret and Ang√©lique Lema√Ætre-Bellenoix. He married Em√©lie Pelletier, daughter of Toussaint Pelletier and Elisabeth Lacoste in 1834. Then in 1839, he married Marie-St√©phanie B√©dard, daughter of the lawyer Joseph B√©dard and of Marie-Genevi√®ve-Scholastique Hubert-Lacroix. The couple had nine children. Bourret died while working on 5 March 1859 at the age of 56. The funeral services were held in the Notre-Dame Basilica. In his memory, Montreal has named Avenue Bourret near Jewish General Hospital, cote St. Catherine. H3S 1X2.

In 2006, he had a terrific minor league season with the Mets' A+ team, St. Lucie. By the end of the season, he was rated by Baseball America as the Mets top catching prospect after hitting .266 with a .335 on-base percentage and a .487 slugging average. He also hit 32 doubles and tied for the Florida State League lead with 21 home runs, making the Florida State League Mid-Season and Post-Season All-Star teams. =Washington Nationals= Flores fielding a pop fly on April 16, . Flores, never having played above A-ball, was obtained by the Washington Nationals in the 2006 Rule 5 draft on December 7, 2006. His major league debut with Washington was on April 4, 2007, and his first start on April 19. Three days later, on April 19, he made his second start, and collected his first hits: he went 2-for-3 with a walk, two doubles and two RBIs. On September 4, 2007, Flores hit a 2 RBI, walk-off single to beat the Florida Marlins. During the 2007‚Äì08 offseason, he played for Navegantes del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. As the 2008 season opened, Flores was the starting catcher for the Nationals. His season would be over on September 3, 2008 after being injured on a collision with Chase Utley when Utley attempted to steal home. On July 20, 2008, Flores collected five hits, all singles, in a 15‚Äì6 Nationals victory over the Atlanta Braves. After 26 games in 2009, Flores was placed on the disabled list with a stress fracture in his shoulder. General Manager Mike Rizzo indicated that he would be out a minimum of three months, and possibly for the rest of the season. He wound up missing the entire 2010 season due to the injury and returned to play 30 games in 2011 and 83 games in 2012. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On January 16, 2013, Flores and the Los Angeles Dodgers agreed to a minor league deal with an invite to spring training.

History In the early 1960s, the U.S. armed forces were developing units specifically designed to counter guerrilla warfare. The first unit in the USAF of this nature was the 4400th Combat Crew Training Squadron code named \\"Jungle Jim\\" that were later renamed the 1st Air Commando Wing (after the similarly named 1st Air Commando Group which served in the China Burma India Theater of World War II). The squadron specialized in tactics used to support friendly ground forces in small, 'brushfire' conflicts. In October 1961, John F. Kennedy authorized the deployment of a detachment of Air Commandos to South Vietnam. The 4400th CCTS headed from their home at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to Southeast Asia. Their mission was to train the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) using older aircraft in support of the type of conflict they were facing. Crews were trained to fly the T-28 Trojan, C-47 Skytrain and B-26 Invader. The code name for the 4400th CCTS and its mission was Farm Gate. A Farm Gate B-26B over Vietnam. While the aircraft involved in the Farm Gate operation were often piloted by American \\"advisers,\\" for training purposes, it was required by Washington that a South Vietnamese national be part of the crew on board any combat missions. In the event an aircraft did get shot down in hostile territory, the presence of a Vietnamese crewman would be enough to dodge potential accusations of violating the Geneva Accords (actual interpretation of this regulation was somewhat liberal, however). There were some reports of hapless South Vietnamese enlisted men being thrown into the back seats of T-28s and flown into combat by American pilots after having been told not to touch anything in the cockpit. The gradual but dramatic expansion of Operation Farm Gate reflected the increasing involvement of the United States in Vietnam.http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/operation-farm-gate-combat- missions-authorized Within days of arrival, the T-28s and pilots were ready for orientation flights. The Farm Gate pilots launched with RVNAF escorts and delivered their ordnance, but, when mission reports were reviewed, the crews were told not to conduct independent air operations. The cover story was that the Americans were in-country to train South Vietnamese pilots. The first Farm Gate combat sorties were flown on 13 January 1962; by month's end, 229 missions had been flown. On 26 December 1961, Washington issued new regulations directing that all Farm Gate missions would include at least one South Vietnamese national on board every aircraft. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara further amplified this requirement by stating that the Vietnamese would fly in the backseat position. Americans, with Vietnamese aboard, were soon flying to destroy Viet Cong supply lines and forces. Flying from Bien Hoa and air bases being improved up-country at Da Nang and Pleiku, T-28 and B-26 operations emphasized \\"training\\" for reconnaissance, surveillance, interdiction, and close air support missions. The SC-47s began flying airdrop and \\"psyop\\" leaflet and loudspeaker broadcast missions to forward bases where the Army's Special Forces teams were working with the rapidly growing South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Groups. In February 1962, a Farm Gate SC-47 on a leaflet drop mission in the highlands near Bao Loc was shot down, killing the six airmen, two soldiers, and one Vietnamese crewman on board. This was the first of several Farm Gate losses. Enemy attacks were increasing across the countryside, and there were rising calls for air support to embattled ground troops. Forward operating locations were opened at Qui Nhon and S√≥c TrƒÉng Airfield. Commanders at 2nd Air Division could see that the RVNAF could not meet all needs, and they increasingly turned to Farm Gate crews to fly the sorties. Realizing that he needed more assets, the commander of 2nd Air Division, then Brig. Gen. Rollen Henry Anthis, asked for additional Air Force personnel and aircraft for Farm Gate use. Anthis wanted 10 more B-26s, five more T-28s, and two more SC-47s. McNamara reviewed the request, but he was cool to the idea of expanding Farm Gate units for combat use. His goal was to build up the RVNAF so it could operate without American help. Still, McNamara approved the request for additional aircraft and also assigned two U-10s to Farm Gate. On 20 July 1963 an SC-47 crew flew an emergency night mission to L·ªôc Ninh and, disregarding enemy fire, strong winds, and blacked- out conditions, landed and rescued six severely wounded South Vietnamese troops. The 602nd Air Commando Squadron also was activated, flying A-1E Skyraiders. Between October 1961 and July 1963, 16 Farm Gate air commandos were killed. Also lost were one SC-47, four T-28s, one U-10, and four B-26s. Within a year of its establishment, the 1st Air Commando Squadron had shed its B-26s and SC-47s and grounded some of its T-28s after two more went down due to catastrophic wing failures. In January 1965, the 48 Farm Gate T-28 Trojans, in conjunction with 92 A-1 Skyraiders of the RVNAF, flew 4,550 bombing sorties. Their effort only supplied half the air support requested. After the escalation of the war as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the Farm Gate detachment was no longer required to fly under South Vietnamese colors. Their aircraft began carrying full U.S. markings and the detachment became known as the 1st Air Commando Squadron (and later as the 1st Special Operations Squadron).

Published in 2004, Foundations of Modern Arab Identity is a trail-blazing study of the Arab Renaissance or al-Nahda, critically engaging the \\"intellectual struggles that ensued when Arab writers internalized Western ways of defining themselves and their societies a century and a half ago.\\"Journal of Arabic Literature (2005), Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp. 224-234. Eminent scholar of the Middle East, Orit Bashkin states that \\"Sheehi‚Äôs work is an innovative and important contribution to the field of Arabic literature, Arab culture, and intellectual history\\" is noted for its \\"imaginative outlook on the ways in which we read the texts that make up the canon of the Arab nahda,\\" otherwise known as the Arabic Renaissance.Orit Bashkin, \\"The Middle East Journal,\\" Vol. 62, No. 2, Spring, 2008, pp. 354-355. Bashkin adds that \\"Sheehi's selection of texts is unique and original. Instead of focusing on either works in social thought or narrative prose, the book studies a variety of texts - pamphlets, newspaper articles, and philosophical tracts as well as maqamat, novels, and sketches - in an attempt to explicate new conversations and ideas, which were articulated in different genres and linguistic modes.\\" Among the first of a wave of scholars to apply post-colonial and post-structural theory, most notably the theory of Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Homi Bhabha, to a decolonial and marxist re-examination modern Arab culture and Arabic literature, the book discusses major Arab intellectuals of the 19th century including Butrus al- Bustani, Salim al-Bustani, Jurji Zaydan, Farah Antun, Ahmad Faris Shidyaq, Nasif al-Yaziji, Muhammad al-Muwaylihi, Muhammad Abduh and others including Jamal ad-din al-Afghani. Anthropologist Lucia Volk writes that Sheehi proves that these intellectual \\"elites actively produced indigenous ideologies of modernity while struggling against the overwhelming powers of Western colonialism.\\"Lucia Volk, International Journal of Middle East Studies (2006), Volume 38, Issue 01, Feb 2006, pp. 132-134. Foundations of Modern Arab Identity is a cornerstone for Nahdah Studies, critically re-examining the intersection of European colonialism and the creation of Arab modernity. Reframing the conception of modern Arab identity from a confrontation between two undifferentiated cultures, the book closely reads \\"foundational\\" Arabic texts from turn of the century to demonstrate that the ideology and discourses of Arab subjectivity were internally formed within the Ottoman Empire at a time of radical transformations in governance and political economy. Sheehi locates the battle for \\"self\\" and \\"other\\" outside of the \\"colonial encounter\\" between Western colonizer and Eastern colonized. Instead, the dialectic between Self and Other transpired internally‚Äîepistemologically and discursively‚Äîon a plane of dynamic cultural and social formations within Ottoman Arab society and polity during the Tanzimat. A groundbreaking work of decolonial theory within modern Arabic literature and thought, Sheehi proposes that the concept of cultural \\"failure\\" is inherent to the ways modern Arab intellectuals critically reorganized and redefined Arab subjectivity during modernity. Examining a host of varying sources including Arab fiction and commentary from the Arab Press, Sheehi maps out a \\"formula\\" for Arab reform during 19th and 20th century al-nahda, which predicates \\"progress and civilization\\" as \\"proleptic\\" teleological endpoints. Linguistically and semiotically structuring this formula was an axiomatic \\"nomenclature of reform\\" that was found in all Arab reform writing and thought despite the ideological, sectarian, political, or national position of the author. This commonality, Sheehi reveals, is due to that historical and political fact that all reform paradigms during the late Ottoman and Mandate periods arose from a fundamental epistemology of Arab modernity; a hybridized but still thorough modern form of modernity that Sheehi states was \\"autogenetic.\\" As this epistemology is based on priorities of indigenous and colonialist capitalist development and Western political hegemony, recast in the form of liberalism and Western cultural and superiority, intellectual paradigms, political programs, and visions of new national social order among Arab thinkers inevitably always express \\"lack\\" as the core of Arab identity because it is engaged in an endless struggle of authority and \\"subjective presence\\" with the West, who otherwise accuses Arabs as being inherently \\"backwards\\". This condition of failure is written into Arab subjectivity by Arabs themselves, internalizing racist notions of Arab otherness that accompany the \\"modern\\", humanist, Enlightenment project. Hence, what is self-diagnosed as \\"the inherent failure of Arab culture and \\"identity\\" is not proof of the inability of the Arab world to enter into modernity but in fact is precisely a condition of it. Hence, Foundations of Modern Arab Identity reveals that a \\"spectral European presence\\" is ever present in Arab modernity and its paradigms of Arab identity.Lital Levy, Jewish Writers in the Arab East: Literature, History, and the Politics of Enlightenment, 1863--1914, Ph.D Dissertation, University of California Berkeley, 2007, pp. 90-91.

Growing to 30 metres tall, it is commonly known as the small-leaved tamarind. It is rare and threatened and is restricted to a small number of sites, each with a maximum of 3 trees per site. However, it is readily available from nurseries in the Northern Rivers area of New South Wales, and in south-eastern Queensland. It has soft hairy new growth that becomes hairless with age. It has a grey brown trunk, the outer surface of live bark is green with orange to brown blotches, leaves 10‚Äì35 cm long, leaflets 4‚Äì8 cm, glossy upper surface, pale dull bottom surface The inflorescence type is a panicle up to 15 centimetres long with small creamy brown flowers, Fruit usually 2 lobed but can be 1 or 3 lobed (each lobe holding a single seed), hairless, Red (rarely yellow) with a brown capsule, ripe Feb- April. Uses The fruit of small-leaved tamarind is edible, and has a piquant flavour. It is used in sauces and preserves. Because the tree is very rare in the wild availability of fruit was a limitation for many years. However, increased planting of small-leaved tamarind has resulted in larger volumes of fruit becoming available for food, as well as ensuring the survival of this species. The plant has proved adaptable in cultivation, being used in amenity horticulture and bushfood plantings. It is extensively planted in Lismore.

She was married to the Dublin printer and publisher George Grierson.  Life  Constantia was born to an impoverished rural family in County Kilkenny. Her parents noticed her intelligence at an early age and furthered her desire to learn by every means that lay in their power. Her father sought advice on the matter, and, although he did not have much money, he was able to supply her with books suited, as he had been told, to the capacity of a child her age. But soon her parents found that her abilities were far beyond her years. Constantia was tutored in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, English, and French by her local vicar, but was mostly self-educated. According to one editor she was \\"a most excellent scholar, not only in Greek and Roman literature, but in history, divinity, philosophy, and mathematics: and what makes her character the more remarkable is, that she died so early as the age of 27, and that she acquired this great learning merely by the force of her own genius, and continual application.\\"() Laetitia Pilkington felt \\"her Learning appeared like the Gift poured out of the Apostles, of speaking all languages without the Pains of Study; or, like the intuitive Knowledge of Angels.\\" At about eighteen Constantia moved to Dublin and began to study midwifery under Dr. Van Lewen, a Dutch physician and the father of Laetitia Pilkington. Constantia ceased her studies when she met publisher George Grierson (c.1679‚Äì1753) for whom she edited many works. By 1727 she had carefully edited titles in the pocket classics edition, including Terence's Comediae, to which she prefixed a Greek epigram from her own pen, inscribing it to Robert, son of Lord Carteret; in 1730 she edited the work of Tacitus, inscribing it to Lord Carteret himself. Jonathan Swift was so impressed with her editing that he wrote to Alexander Pope on 6 February 1730: 'She is a very good Latin and Greek scholar, and hath lately published a fine edition of Tacitus, and she writes carmina Anglicana non-contemnenda.' The edition was also much praised by the classical scholar Edward Harwood. It is not clear if they married at all, as the date is unrecorded. Constantia played an important role in her husband's business and household, which included apprentices and journeymen as well as domestic servants. Highly regarded by Dublin's literary √©lite for her gifts as an editor as well as a poet, and for her remarkable memory, women from the landed gentry of Ireland were attracted to her and became some of her husband's most valued customers. Her husband emphasised her contributions in his successful petition to the Irish House of Commons in 1729 to be granted the patent for King's Printer: \\"the Editions corrected by her have been approved of, not only in this Kingdom, but in Great Britain, Holland and elsewhere, and the Art of Printing, through her care and assistance, has been brought to greater perfection than has been hitherto in this Kingdom.\\"() In addition to her editorial work she was a poet. Little of her poetry survives, however her friend Mary Barber published six of her pieces in her Poems on Several Occasions (1734). Those six and two others, included by Laetitia Pilkington in her Memoirs, were published in Poems by the Most Eminent Ladies of Great Britain and Ireland. Jonathan Swift included her, along with Barber and literary critic Elizabeth Sican, in his \\"triumfeminate\\" and she was part of his Dublin literary circle. After a period of frail health, Grierson died at the age of twenty-seven, possibly of tuberculosis, and was buried in Drumcondra, County Dublin. Her reputation was enhanced by being mentioned by George Ballard in his Memoirs of Several Ladies of Great Britain, who have been Celebrated for their Writings or Still in the Learned Languages, Arts and Sciences (1752), though she did not receive much critical attention until recently.()  Works  Female Poets of Great Britain, Rowton * Editions of Virgil, Terence (Dublin, 1727), and Tacitus (3 vols., Dublin, 1730). Virgil, Terence and Tacitus were three of the greatest writers/poets of their time. They wrote a multitude of books in their day. Virgil is well known for his tale The Aenid. In Constantia's time, not many knew how to speak Latin. Constantia studied Latin and was able to edit the works of these three great men. Many people were impressed by her editing skills. Constantia started editing when she was eighteen; by the time she completed these three edits she was only 24. Her great intelligence and ability garnered her much due adoration among her peers. When Constantia was assisting her husband in his appeal to the House of Commons her edits were described as follows, \\"the Editions corrected by her have been approved of, not only in this Kingdom, but in Great Britain, Holland and elsewhere, and the Art of Printing, through her care and assistance, has been brought to greater perfection than has been hitherto in this Kingdom.\\" In addition to her editorial work she was a poet. Little of her poetry survives, however her friend Mary Barber published six of her pieces in her Poems on Several Occasions (1734). * . Constantia's poems are few and far between, yet the ones still in circulation are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen‚Äîwritten in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would be unfair to give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.

A spectacular commercial and administrative failure, the Sesqui event has subsequently become an icon of corporate mismanagement within New Zealand popular culture.  History  Billed by promoters as 'New Zealand's biggest event ever', the festival was staged in Wellington to mark the New Zealand sesquicentenary celebrations, the 150th anniversary of the 1840 signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. The event was a joint venture between the Wellington Show Association and the Wellington 1990 Trust, a well-funded regional organisation. The Wellington regional and city councils jointly underwrote this event by NZ$1.4 million. The Sesqui festival was planned to include a wide range of cultural, trade and scientific exhibits as well as entertainment events and funfair amusements. It was scheduled to run for six weeks and anticipated to attract 30,000 visitors per day, despite the fact that the population of the entire Wellington region at that time was fewer than 400,000 people. Several weeks before the festival was due to begin, the media reported that the Sesqui organisers had decided to stage their opening celebration simultaneously with the opening celebrations of the 1990 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. Neither the Sesqui organisers nor the Arts Festival organisers were prepared to alter their plans.  The event  NZ$150,000 worth of fireworks launched Day 1 of Sesqui 1990. The festival organisers had made a decision to split the event between two venues, one at the Wellington Waterfront and the other at the (then) Wellington Show and Sports Centre in Newtown. Despite the arrangement of a shuttle bus service between these two venues, this decision had the effect of confusing and frustrating potential visitors to the festival, with the result that neither venue attracted visitor numbers beyond an average of 2,500 per day. The organisers had also adopted a policy against advertising the daily schedules for musical and other performances taking place at either venue. This policy was based on the assumption that it would encourage visitors to prolong their stay and to make numerous return visits so as not to miss seeing favourite performers. As a result, a number of popular musicians, singers and other entertainers played to largely empty houses because the public did not know when or where they were performing. Within days of the opening of the festival, media reports began to suggest that it was faltering. During a heated radio interview, Wellington City Councillor Ruth Gotlieb maintained that it was \\"every Wellingtonian's civic duty to attend Sesqui.\\" The highest attendance figure was achieved during the final days of the event, when 32,000 visitors took advantage of a decision to waive all entry fees, which were widely regarded as being excessive. Although planned to run for six weeks, Sesqui 1990 closed after only two weeks with debts in excess of NZ$6.4 million.  Aftermath  The collapse of the Sesqui 1990 festival forced a number of small companies that had been contracted to supply various goods and services to the event into receivership and/or bankruptcy. The Wellington Show Association was liquidated in 1999. Two iconic billboards promoting Sesqui 1990 remained standing for a number of months after the event's premature closure, apparently because the organisers could not afford to have them removed. One of these, featuring an image of gleeful Sesqui visitors, was quickly defaced with graffiti reading \\"And I laughed and laughed and laughed\\". The other billboard, a plywood cut-out representing Sesqui mascot \\"Pesky Sesky\\" ‚Äì a sort of anthropomorphic opossum, or possibly sasquatch ‚Äì had been erected on a rooftop to welcome visitors to the Show and Sports Centre venue, and eventually disappeared during a wind storm. Other sesquicentenary events fared better, including the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame, which went on to have a life of its own.

Baja California and Los Cabos, 308 pages History The pictographs are likely the artistic products of the Cochimi people in the Baja California peninsula. This group became culturally extinct in the nineteenth century but is comparatively well known through the writings of eighteenth-century Jesuit missionaries. These paintings on the roofs and walls of rock shelters in the Sierra de San Francisco were first discovered by Europeans in the eighteenth century by the Mexican Jesuit missionary Jos√© Mariano Rotea.Francisco Javier Clavijero. 1789. Storia della California. 2 vols. Appresso Modesto Penzo, Venice.Miguel del Barco. 1973. Historia natural y cr√≥nica de la antigua California. Edited by Miguel Le√≥n- Portilla. Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. According to some native beliefs recorded by the Jesuits and others, the paintings were drawn by a race of giants‚Äîa supposition that has been discarded by scientific investigators since the late nineteenth century.Don Laylander. 2014. \\"The beginnings of prehistoric archaeology in Baja California, 1732-1913\\". Pacific Coast Archaeological Society Quarterly 50(1&2):1-32. This belief may have been suggested by the larger-than-life size of many of the human (as well as animal) figures. Some observers have speculated that the paintings had meanings relating to hunting magic, religious practices, or ancestor worship, but there is no consensus on these interpretations. Animal species including deer, wild sheep, rabbit, puma, lynx, whale, turtle, fish, and birds are depicted. There are also abstract elements of various forms. A growing body of radiocarbon dates relating to the paintings has suggested ages from as early as 5500 BCE to as late as European contact in the eighteenth century. Geography The pictographs are at around 250 sites, which are located east of the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve. Access to the paintings is difficult due to the isolated location, which also has helped to minimize vandalism and destruction of the out cropping. =Landmark= The area has one of the most important concentration of Pre-Columbian art on the Baja California Peninsula. It is of exceptional quality at both national and international standards: for the high quality, extent, variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. In 1989 the rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated for, and in 1993 became, a World Heritage Site.

Simmons held several junior Ministerial positions in the Hawke and Keating Governments. Early career Simmons was born in Broken Hill, New South Wales and arrived in Bathurst, New South Wales in 1965 and commenced study for teacher training at Bathurst Teacher's College. After graduation, Simmons taught at Tullibigeal Central, Bletchington and Broken Hill North before changing to secondary teaching and transferring to Bathurst High School where he became Head Teacher of Social Science. He had also completed a Bachelor of Arts and a Masters of Education with honours from the University of New England. Simmons was an elected Alderman on Bathurst City Council from 1978 to 1983. Federal political career Simmons was elected to the Australian House of Representatives seat of Calare at the 1983 federal election, after two unsuccessful attempts, representing the Australian Labor Party. Simmons was re-elected as Member for Calare at the 1984, 1987, 1990, and 1993 Australian federal elections. He was appointed Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in April 1989 in the third Hawke ministry. In April 1990, in the fourth Hawke ministry, Simmons became Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories. In December 1991, Simmons became Minister for Family Support from and Minister for Local Government in the first Keating ministry. Following the March 1993 Australian federal election, Simmons was not re-appointed to the second Keating ministry. During the National Tax Summit in 1985, Simmons initially raised the concept of a national identity card, later entitled as the Australia Card, as a measure to address community and government concern about tax evasion and tax avoidance; concerns over the extent of welfare fraud; fears over the extent of illegal immigration. Additionally, there was a belief expressed in some quarters that an identity card or national registration procedure might assist the government's administration processes. Legislation was introduced into Parliament and finally rejected by the Australian Senate in 1987 after significant community concerns, including privacy. Following his retirement from Parliament, Simmons conceded that he didn't think the concept would ever be accepted by the public. During his Parliamentary career, Simmons was the Australian representative at the UN in New York for three months and delivered an address on the apartheid policy in South Africa. Simmons retired from Parliament ahead of the 1996 federal election and moved to Newcastle. Post political career Since his retirement from politics, Simmons has served on a number of government and non-profit Boards, including: :*Chief Executive Officer of Newcastle and Hunter Business Chamber (1997‚Äì2001) :*General Manager of Newcastle Regional Chamber of Commerce (1997 -1998?) :*Director of Tourism NSW (1997‚Äì2003) :*Chairman of the Hunter Medical Research Institute Foundation (2002‚Äì2003) :*Director of the Regional Land Management Corporation (a subsidiary of the Hunter Water Corporation) (2003‚Äì2005) :*President of the New South Wales division of the National Heart Foundation of Australia (2006‚Äì2009).

During 2006, Simmons was appointed by the NSW Minister for Local Government to undertake a formal public inquiry into Broken Hill City Council. Simmons' wife, Kaye, has also held positions in the New South Wales division of the Labor Party. In 2006, it was reported that she was on the ALP administrative committee and served as campaign manager for Jodi McKay, Labor candidate and subsequent Member for Newcastle.

He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm medium-fast bowler who formerly played for Essex. He had previously played for Derbyshire for eight years. Smith was born in Johannesburg. His international cricketing career began when he played in the Under-19 World Cup competition of 2002 for South Africa, debuting with a steady bowling performance against Bangladesh in a convincing victory for his side. South Africa were to make it to the final of the competition, in which Smith scored a half-century from the number one batting position, though it was not enough to see his team win the match, as this was countered by a century by New South Wales' Under-19 Australian representative Jarrad Burke. Smith made his first appearance in first-class cricket in October 2003, playing for Griqualand West in the 2003‚Äì04 SuperSport series, in which the team finished in second place in the league. Smith would make one half-century during 2003‚Äì04, against Boland, and left the team in the summer of 2004. Desperate for a County Championship place at a burgeoning team, Smith joined Derbyshire and made his debut Second XI Championship appearance in the same period, in July 2004. However, having scored a duck, he was not to appear again for the side until the 2005 season, where he played in both the Second XI Championship and Trophy. Smith made his debut in the County Championship in the 2006 season, scoring steadily with the bat from the middle order and even trying his hand at bowling during the second innings. As Derbyshire finished mid-table during 2006, Smith stepped in for more appearances for the side, and looked promising for the team's future. In 2008, Smith scored the 20th century in the history of the Twenty20 Cup with a 62-ball innings against Yorkshire Carnegie on 12 June 2008. He ended on exactly 100 not out, in a winning performance for Derbyshire. This, as well as other strong performances, led to him being awarded a new contract which will keep him at Derbyshire for a further two years. He has completed his residency period and is looking to qualify as an English player, following a similar path to that of Kevin Pietersen, for example, but in the meantime plays as a Kolpak player. During the 2011 season, it was announced that he would leave Derbyshire at the end of the season, and in September 2011, he was signed by Essex on a two-year deal, up to the end of the 2013 season. Although continuing with the club after his initial contract ended, he was one of four players released by Essex at the end of the 2015 season. In February 2016 he announced his retirement from first-class cricket, having taken a job as Director of Cricket Development and Head Coach for Penzance Cricket Club.

The name possibly meant 'wood or clearing frequented by rooks' from the Old English words hr≈çc (rook) and lƒìah (wood clearing). It has also been suggested the first element may be from an Old English personal name Hr≈çc or Hroca. The hundred that covered Ruxley was originally called Helmestrei, a name that had been used since at least the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. By at least the late thirteenth century, the name Helmestrei was no longer in use, and the hundred came to be known as Hundred of Ruxley taking its new name from the settlement of Ruxley, which was the meeting place of the hundred, located on the main road, which passed through it. History Ruxley was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, as a settlement of 20 households, with woodland, pigs and a mill located in the Hundred of Ruxley, within the Lathe of Sutton at Hone. At that time Ruxley was recorded as having more households than the surrounding settlements of North Cray, Foots Cray and St Paul's Cray, but less than Orpington, St Mary Cray, Bexley and Chelsfield.Hundred of Ruxley (Helmestrei) entry in the Domesday Book (1086) listing number of households in Ruxley and other Settlements. accessed from OpenDomesday.org A family who possessed much of the lands of North Cray and Ruxley took their surname from Ruxley.

In the thirteenth century, St Botolph's Church was constructed in Ruxley. Ruxley was a distinct parish of its own, until 1557 when Cardinal Reginald Pole, the archbishop of Canterbury deconsecrated the church and united Ruxley parish with North Cray parish, located northwest of Ruxley. The new larger parish was sometimes referred to as North Cray with Ruxley,Edward Hasted, 'The hundred of Ruxley: Introduction', in The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 2 (Canterbury, 1797), pp. 1‚Äì2.

The Hundred of Ruxley became obsolete at the end of the nineteenth century when new districts began to be created. In 1894 North Cray parish, including the settlement of Ruxley formed part of the newly created Bromley Rural District that existed from that year until 1934 when it was abolished.F.

It was in use for around 300 years but was deconsecrated by Cardinal Reginald Pole in 1557, the same year he united Ruxley parish with that of North Cray into one parish. The church building was used as a barn for over 400 years and was used to store agricultural equipment. In the 1960s archaeological work was carried out on the site and found evidence of an older wooden building, suggesting there may have been an older Saxon church in the same location. Today the church is a Grade II listed building and a scheduled ancient monument on the grounds of Ruxley Manor Garden Centre, and is owned by the Evans family.

In 1975 the site was designated an SSSI.Natural England, Ruxley Gravel Pits citation Over 500 species of vascular plants and 169 of birds have been recorded, including song thrush, reed bunting, kingfisher and skylark. Fifty-three of the bird species are breeding. Insects include 23 species of butterfly, 9 dragonfly and over 500 beetles. This variety reflects the diversity of habitat: wooded islands, fringes of mature trees, scrub, fen and open water. Vegetation on the banks include the rare club rush Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani. The open water areas have rafts of yellow and white water-lily. Access to the site is reserved to members of the Orpington and District Angling Society and permit holders. It is closed to members of the public.Notice on the entrance to the site in Edgington Way Transport =Roads= The main road that runs through Ruxley is named Maidstone Road, today it is a relatively straight road, designated the B2173 road running east to west. To the east, it goes uphill through Upper Ruxley, Birchwood Corner and changes its name to High Street then London Road as it skirts Swanley town centre before joining junction 3 of the M25 motorway where the B road ends. To the west, Maidstone Road continues downhill over Ruxley Corner roundabout, at which the B road designation ends, but Maidstone Road continues west over the River Cray then through Foots Cray and uphill to Sidcup as the A 211 road named Maidstone Road, Foots Cray High Street, Sidcup Hill, and Sidcup High Street; further west it's named Main Road and Foots Cray Road and reaches Eltham. Maidstone Road was historically the route of the original A20 road, the main route from London to Maidstone; old maps show it was previously a winding road as it passed through Ruxley,Edward Hasted, 'The hundred of Bromley and Beckenham: Introduction and map', in The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 1 (Canterbury, 1797), p. 527. accessed from British History Online 16 May 2016. and part of it survives today as a crescent road named Old Maidstone Road to the south of the present Maidstone Road leaving and rejoining it after about 500 metres. In the Ruxley area the B2173 marks the border between the London Borough of Bexley to the north, and the London Borough of Bromley to the south. Just to the south of Maidstone Road, the new A20 road runs east to west, it is a dual-carriageway, and a primary trunk road route. The section near Ruxley was built as a bypass road in 1968 to bypass Swanley. It is named Sidcup Bypass then Sidcup Road to the west where it bypasses Sidcup and Eltham towards Lee and Lewisham, and named Swanley Bypass to the east, until it meets the M25 near Swanley then continues on through Kent, all the way to Dover on the coast. In the Ruxley area, Sidcup Bypass marks the border between the postcode districts, DA14 SIDCUP to the north, BR5 ORPINGTON to the southwest, and BR8 SWANLEY to the southeast. Ruxley Corner, is a roundabout, located immediately west of Ruxley, which has five exits, two of which are the aforementioned Maidstone Road, to the east and west. North-northeast from here is North Cray, a dual-carriageway A road, designated the A223 road, it travels 4 km north to Bexley, where it ceases to be a dual-carriageway and continues to a junction and bridge over the A2 road, Rochester Way, as Bexley High Street and Bourne Road, before meeting Watling Street at Crayford. To the southeast of Ruxley Corner the A223 road continues as Edgington Way for 1 km before reaching Crittall's Corner. Sandy Lane, is a minor road that travels south from Ruxley Corner through St Paul's Cray. Crittall's Corner, named after a window factory, comprises a much bigger and grade separated roundabout west of Ruxley and immediately south of Foots Cray.

Tsubasa was placed in a geostationary transfer orbit. It ended its operational phase on February 26, 2003. A similar mission, MDS-2, was cancelled. The purpose of the mission was to test the performance of commercial off-the-shelf components, including solar batteries, semiconductors and computers.. MDS-1 also carried instrumentation to observe how changes in the environment as the satellite passed through the Van Allen radiation belts affected the performance of each component. Among these instruments were a dosimeter using radiation-sensitive field effect transistors, a magnetometer, and a device for tracking heavy ions. During the mission, MDS-1 tracked the occurrence of single event upsets, finding the majority occurred while passing the inner belt during solar maximum and were likely caused by high energy protons.

It originates in the Black Mountain Range and drains into the Pacific Ocean. Major tributaries include the Sech√≠n River (right). The valley contains the small, once important town of Casma, which had to be rebuilt after being destroyed by the 1970 Ancash earthquake. The new town has been completed.  Economy  The main economic activity is agriculture. The valley produces fruits: including avocados, passionfruit, apples, mangoes, pacay, bananas, guayaba, pepino, and grapes; and other crops, including corn, cotton, asparagus, chilies, and several kinds of beans.  Archaeology  The Casma Valley, a coastal valley situated about north of Lima, Peru, lies along the Casma River, between the towns Chimbote and Huarmey. It is notable for the grand scale of numerous archaeological sites of the Casma/Sechin culture, including stone-faced pyramids and the Thirteen Towers of Chankillo. Sech√≠n Alto is the largest American construction of the second millennium BCE. Cerro Sechin is also from the Sechin culture. = Huaynun√° = (Coordinates ) The coastal pre-ceramic site of Huaynun√° (Huaynuma), 13 km north of the Casma Valley, has also been investigated by archaeologists. An early, public religious tradition of architecture is represented there by a large elevated structure built on a hillside. This is a precursor to the much larger Initial Period religious mounds on the coast of Peru. Evidence from Huaynun√°, as well as the dates from other Casma Valley sites, indicate that larger-scale irrigation agriculture, use of pottery, and weaving did not appear in the Casma Valley area until about 1600 BC, some 200 years later than similar developments on the central coast of Peru. Also, at Huaynuma, potatoes dating to about 2000 BC have been found.Ugent D., S. Pozorski and T. Pozorski. 1982. Archaeological potato tuber remains from the Casma Valley of Peru. Econ.

Publication history The Gauntlet made his first appearance in She-Hulk #100 and was created by Dan Slott, Stefano Caselli, and Eric Powell. He was, however, not referred to by name until the first issue of Avengers: The Initiative. His origin was finally revealed in the 2007 Avengers: The Initiative annual. Fictional character biography The story of the Gauntlet began when two aliens of unknown origin, one fully armored, the other multi- limbed, engaged in a struggle to the death above Earth. Both extraterrestrials expired upon entering the atmosphere, and their weapons scattered across the planet's surface. The US government tracked the crash site of two of the armored alien's weapons to the Middle-East, where Sergeant Joseph Green was dispatched to secure the area. Upon arrival, Green's unit came under attack by HYDRA troopers, forcing him to use the right gauntlet of the alien's armor in order to defeat them. After securing victory, Joseph found himself unable to remove the gauntlet, and was seen walking away from the area, carrying the alien's sword with him. How the alien's other gauntlet was acquired by Southpaw has not yet been revealed, nor has how the alien's leg armor came to become part of the costume of Grasshopper. However, the opposing alien's weapon later found its way into Armory's possession.Avengers: The Initiative Annual. Marvel Comics. In the aftermath of the Civil War storyline, Gauntlet was recruited by Henry Peter Gyrich into being a drill sergeant at a superhero training camp. He is fully aware of the \\"darker\\" aspects of the training camp and is apparently willingly going along with some hidden agenda by the powers behind the camp's running. Gauntlet also lives with his wife and daughter on base. He has confided in his wife that he only wants to prepare the recruits for the rough life of being a superhero and is only harsh to them in order to do so. Any sort of harm that befalls the recruits he takes as a personal failure for not teaching them well enough. He makes particular use of the New Warriors name as an insult, referencing that team's role in the disaster that sparked the Civil War's events; this not only causes friction with recruits, several of whom are former New Warriors members/associates, but also with the Avenger Justice, a New Warriors founder and a liaison/\\"counselor\\" for the young recruits. After the events of World War Hulk, Gauntlet is angered at the many cadets who had broken orders to confront the Hulk themselves.Avengers: The Initiative #5 (2007). Marvel Comics. He is badly beaten and left with a \\"NW\\" on his chest, daubed in his own blood. The team had recently learned of a social movement, indicated through 'NW' graffiti, of young people in general defiance of the current power structure. Upon regaining consciousness, he identified his assailant as the Ghost. However, it's later revealed (to the reader) that the attacker was none other than base recruit Slapstick, taking revenge for Gauntlet's pejorative use of the New Warriors' name.Avengers: The Initiative #6 (2007). Marvel Comics. It is known that Gyrich mobilized a government physician to revive Gauntlet before a S.H.I.E.L.D. investigation discovered the truth, and was present when Gauntlet made the false identification. While Gauntlet was incapacitated, Taskmaster took over his drill instructor duties.Avengers: The Initiative #8. Marvel Comics. During Gauntlet's coma, Henry Peter Gyrich attempted to equip KIA with Armory's weapon the Tactigon. After the weapon successfully bonded with KIA, the clone's flooded with memories of the original MVP's death, seeking vengeance on those involved in the death. Upon arriving at Gauntlet's hospital room, the clone is surprised to find Gauntlet's bed empty. Following this, it appears the gauntlet weapon itself is temporarily controlling Green, forcing him to acquire the sword element of the alien's armor.Avengers: The Initiative #9. Marvel Comics. Following an altercation with KIA, the clone's attacks appeared to cause the gauntlet to lose its control over Gauntlet, causing him to revert to his normal self.Avengers: The Initiative #10. Marvel Comics. It is later revealed that when the Tactigon stabbed Gauntlet, it injected him with a drug that brought him out of his coma, as it considered his control over the weapon to be a weak point. During an invasion of Earth by the Skrull Empire, Gauntlet and Taskmaster attempt to ensure the safety of the cadets at Camp Hammond by locking down the facility. However, a Skrull posing as Yellowjacket gives orders to Gauntlet to send the Initiative cadets to help fight the Skrulls in New York City.Secret Invasion #3. Marvel Comics. Following the invasion's end, Gauntlet is placed in charge of the Camp Hammond facility; many of the other instructors left, unwilling to place themselves under Norman Osborn's control, and the real Hank Pym declined to be a part of the Initiative, as he was never really there in the first place, leaving Gauntlet to reluctantly assume the position.Avengers: The Initiative #21. Marvel Comics. When Osborn threatened to take Gauntlet's arm, Gauntlet escaped and ultimately joined the Avengers Resistance.Avengers: The Initiative #25. Marvel Comics. His wife pretends to be ashamed of him for abandoning his family, so that she will not be harassed when he is not there to protect her.Avengers: the Initiative #26. Marvel Comics. As Osborn's regime ends following the Siege of Asgard, Gauntlet is sent by personal request to Afghanistan.Age Of Heroes #2 (June 2010). Marvel Comics. During the \\"Iron Man 2020\\" event, Gauntlet appears as a member of Force Works. During a raid on a robot hideout, one of the robots self- destructs when cornered by War Machine and Gauntlet. Maria Hill mentioned to War Machine that Gauntlet will be in the hospital for a few weeks.2020 Force Works #1. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Joseph's right hand is fused to a large, robotic gauntlet of alien origin, which is able to manifest a right hand made of pure energy that is larger, stronger, and more durable than his own. The gauntlet itself appears to have the ability to exert a certain degree of control upon Green, specifically when he is in a state of low-brain activity. Gauntlet can not only use the reliquary for manifesting energy limbs, but also discharging machinery & cybernetics debilitating energy as concussive blasts.Tony Stark: Iron Man #2. Marvel Comics.Tony Stark: Iron Man #9. Marvel Comics. It can also surround its wearer in an energy field to enable self propelled flight.Tony Stark: Iron Man #9. Marvel Comics.

She was the founder of the Muslim Women's Association (Jamaa'at al-Sayyidaat al-Muslimaat). Biography =Early life= Her father was educated at al- Azhar University independent religious teacher and cotton merchant. He encouraged her to become an Islamic leader citing the example of Nusayba bint Ka'b al-Muzaniyya, a woman fought alongside Prophet Muhammad in the Battle of Uhud. For a short time during her teens, she joined the Egyptian Feminist Union only to conclude that \\"Islam gave women rights in the family granted by no other society. At the age of eighteen, she founded the Jama'at al-Sayyidat al-Muslimat (Muslim Women's Association), which she claimed had a membership of three million throughout the country by the time it was dissolved by government order in 1964. =Allegiance to Hassan Al-Banna= Hasan Al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, invited al-Ghazali to merge her organisation with his, an invitation she refused as she wished to retain autonomy. However, she did eventually take an oath of personal loyalty to al Banna. (Mahmood 2005: 68) The fact that her organisation was not formally affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood was to prove useful after the Ikhwan was banned, as for a time al Ghazali was able to continue to distribute their literature and host their meetings in her home. = Theory = Zeinab al- Ghazali promulgated a feminism that was inherently Islamic. She believed in a \\"notion of habituated learning through practical knowledge\\" of Islam and the Qu'ran, and felt that women's liberation, economic rights, political rights, etc. could be achieved through a more intimate understanding of Islam. al- Ghazali also believed that a woman's primary responsibility was within the home, but that she should also have the opportunity to participate in political life if she so chose. al-Ghazali's Patriarchal Islamist stance allowed her to publicly disagree with several issues that \\"put her at odds with male Islamist leaders\\". =Muslim Women's Association= Her weekly lectures to women at the Ibn Tulun Mosque drew a crowd of three thousand, which grew to five thousand during holy months of the year. Besides offering lessons for women, the association published a magazine, maintained an orphanage, offered assistance to poor families, and mediated family disputes. The association also took a political stance, demanding that Egypt the Qur'an. Some scholars, like Leila Ahmed, Miriam Cooke, M. Qasim Zaman, and Roxanne Euben argue that Al Ghazali's own actions stand at a distance,Miriam Cook ‚ÄúZaynab al-GhazƒÅlƒ´: Saint or Subversive?‚Äù Die Welt des Islams , New Series, Vol. 34, Issue 1 (Apr., 1994), 2. and even undercuts some of her professed beliefs.Leila Ahmed Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1992),199. To these scholars, among many, her career is one which resists conventional forms of domesticity, while her words, in interviews, publications, and letters which do define women largely as wives and mothers.Roxanne L. Euben, Muhammad Qasim Zaman (eds.) ‚ÄúZaynab al- Ghazali‚Äù Princeton Reaadings in Islamist thought: Texts and Contexts from al- Banna to Bin Laden.(Princeton: Princeton UP, 2009), 275 In justifying her own exceptionality to her stated belief in a woman's rightful role, al Ghazali described her own childlessness as a \\"blessing\\" that would not usually be seen as such, because it freed her to participate in public life. (Hoffman 1988). Her second husband died while she was in prison, having divorced her after government threats to confiscate his property. al Ghazali's family were angered at this perceived disloyalty, but al Ghazali herself remained loyal to him, writing in her memoir that she asked for his photograph to be reinstated in their home when told that it had been removed. =Life in prison= After the assassination of Hasan al-Banna in 1949, Al-Ghazali was instrumental in regrouping the Muslim Brotherhood in the early 1960s. Imprisoned for her activities in 1965, she was sentenced to twenty-five year of hard labor but was released under Anwar Sadat's Presidency in 1971. During the imprisonment, Zainab Al-Ghazali and members of the Muslim Brotherhood underwent inhumane tortures. Al-Ghazali recounts her being thrown into a cell locked up with dogs to confess assassination attempt on President Nassir. Al-Ghazzali during these periods of hardship she is reported to have had visions of Muhammed. Some miracles were also experienced by her, as she got food, refuge and strength during those difficult times. After her release from prison, al-Ghazali resumed teaching and writing for the revival of Muslim Brotherhood's magazine, Al-Dawah. She was editor of a women's and children's section in Al-Dawah, in which she encouraged women to become educated, but to be obedient to their husbands and stay at home while rearing their children. She wrote a book based on her experience in jail. =Memoir= She describes her prison's experience, which included torture, in a book entitled AyyƒÅm min ·∏•ayƒÅtƒ´, published in English as Days from My Life by Hindustan Publications in 1989 and as Return of the Pharoah by the Islamic Foundation (UK) in 1994. The \\"Pharaoh\\" referred to is President Nasser. Al Ghazali depicts herself as enduring torture with strength beyond that of most men, and she attests to both miracles and visions that strengthened her and enabled her to survive.(in German) Gef√§ngnisbericht einer Muslimschwester, extracts, in: Andreas Meier, ed.: Politische Str√∂mungen im modernen Islam.

Although the Islamic movement throughout the Muslim world today has attracted large number of young women, especially since the 1970s, Zaynab al-Ghazali stands out thus for as the only woman to distinguish herself as one of its major leaders.

He helped found the Young Kikuyu Association and the East African Association before being arrested and exiled from 1922 to 1931. In 1932 he became President of the Kikuyu Central Association, in 1935 founded the Kikuyu Provincial Association, and in 1944 founded the Kenya African Study Union. Opposed to the Mau Mau movement, he later retired to coffee-farming. Education Harry Thuku was born in Kambui in Kiambu district of Central Kenya. His family were Kikuyu, one of the ethnic groups that lost the largest amount of land to white settlers during the British takeover of Kenya. He spent four years at the school of the Kambui Gospel Mission, Harry Thuku became a typesetter for the Leader, a European settler newspaper. In 1918, he rose to the position of a clerk-telegraph operator in the government treasury office in Nairobi. He accumulated vast experience while he was working for the government. Thuku was one of the first of Kenya's Africans to be fully capable of working in the English language. Political activism =The Kikuyu Association= In association with Abdalla Tairara, Thuku helped found the Young Kikuyu Association, the first organisation to defend African interests in colonial Kenya. The Young Kikuyu Association was a non-militant group that pursued a peaceful and structured liberation struggle with the government and missions. Its main concern was for the preservation of African-owned land. Thuku argued that land was an important factor of production and that the livelihood of the Kikuyu people, who are primarily farmers, risked being lost. His message reverberated strongly not only within his immediate Kikuyu tribe but also with other farming communities in Kenya and Africa. From 1920 to 1921 Thuku served as the secretary to the Kikuyu Association. However, he was more interested in action-oriented measures to address the rising economic challenges facing Kenyan Africans, realizing that the organisation was becoming heavily political and thus ill-equipped to achieve the association's original objectives of economic emancipation. In 1921, he stepped down from his position at the Kikuyu Association. Kenyan Africans were suffering economic difficulties, and the Europeans who were now in control of vast swathes of the local economy wanted to further cut Native African wages on the pretext of reviving the colony's economic position. Thuku's political and economic vision for the native African is widely credited as an important underlying common theme that was adopted and greatly characterised the greater African struggle for economic and political independence. =East African Association= In July 1921 Thuku founded the East African Association, the first multi-ethnic political organization in East Africa.J. Makong‚Äôo et al. History and Government Form 2. East African Publishers. pp. 103‚Äì. . Retrieved 1 November 2011. Based in Nairobi, the East African Association drew its members from many tribal groups, though most members were Kikuyu. Unusually for the time, the East African Association also involved a number of women. It campaigned against the kipande system of pass controls, and the forced labour of women and girls.By the early 1920s, women and girls were being conscripted in increasing numbers, for both public work, such as digging roads and trenches, and private work, typically working on white-owned plantations. Since this removed them from their families, and exposed them to assault, it was deeply unpopular. Winston Churchill had issued a memorandum forbidding forced labour in 1921, but the practice had apparently continued. Arrest and exile The colonial Kenyan government was heavily opposed to the association's aims. The settler-dominated colony was not yet ready for any forceful representation of African economic, social and political views, and moved to ban national political movements. On 14 March 1922, Thuku was arrested in connection with his political activities. On the two following days, there were demonstrations initiated by Mary Muthoni Nyanjiru to protest his arrest. The first demonstration, on the 15th, passed off peacefully, dispersing after a public prayer for Thuku's safety.See Wipper 1989:313 On the morning of the 16th, a crowd of 7-8,000 of his supporters gathered around the Nairobi police station to demand his release from detention. The police eventually opened fire on the demonstrators, killing at least 25 of them.See Lonsdale 2004 for the number of casualties. White civilians joined in the shooting, and may have shot some of the protesters in the back.See Lonsdale 2004 for white civilian participation, and Thuku 1970: 33 for the claim that white civilians shot protesters in the back.The Times, 18 March 1922, p. 10. The White Paper issued by the British Government put the number of dead at 21. The Times, 27 May 1922, p. 9. Thuku was exiled, without charge or trial, to Kismayu in the Northern Frontier Province of Kenya, in present-day Somalia. During Thuku's absence, the government of the day tried to co-opt the association leadership with monetary inducements and piece-meal reforms. Thuku remained in their thoughts as a primary leader. The East African Association declined to participate in the political process, but those co-opted individuals and a host more who were interested in classical African political rights remained actively engaged. =Kikuyu Central Association= Thuku was given permission to return to Kiambu in January 1931.The Times, 8 January 1931, p. 11. By that time, the colonial government allowed formation of tribal based political parties restricted to some tribal 'homelands' only. This was done to avoid national uprising against the colonial authorities.. In 1932 Thuku became president of the Kikuyu Central Association, then Kenya's foremost African political group. Although dissension arose among the loyalists and the co-opted leaders of the association, which was fomented by the colonial powers of the day. The power struggles split the organisation into factions. =Kikuyu Provincial Association= Harry Thuku went on to re-assemble the loyal remnants of the East African Association, which was renamed the Kikuyu Provincial Association in 1935, devoted to legal, non-militant protest. In 1944 he founded the Kenya African Study Union, the precursor of the Kenya African Union. Influence on the independence movement Harry Thuku's ideals and approach were one strand in the larger African struggle for political and economic independence from the late 1940s to 1960s. However, Thuku's advocacy of moderation in political struggle caused a permanent split between Thuku and the rising generation of the future leaders of Kenya. He was strongly opposed to the Mau Mau movement. On 12 December 1952 he broadcast to the nation, saying that \\"To-day we, the Kikuyu, stand ashamed and looked upon as hopeless people in the eyes of other races and before the Government. Why? Because of the crimes perpetrated by Mau Mau and because the Kikuyu have made themselves Mau Mau.\\" Thuku's apparent premise was false: not all, or even most, of the Kikuyu had taken the Mau Mau oaths. By this time, Thuku was ultra-conservative: KPA members were required to take an oath \\"to be loyal to His Majesty the King of Great Britain and the established government and...to do nothing which is not constitutional according to British traditions or do anything which is calculated to disturb the peace, good order and government\\" (see Maloba 1998: 50). At the time, these regulations, innocent enough in themselves, were unacceptable to most of Thuku's former colleagues and supporters. It unclear, therefore, how seriously his denunciation would have been taken. On 28 January 1954 he joined twenty two other Kikuyu leaders at Kabete in subscribing to an appeal to the people to renounce and denounce Mau Mau.The Times (Saturday, 13 December 1952), p. 6. The Times (Friday, 29 January 1954), p. 8. Retirement from politics Thuku later retired to a successful life in coffee-farming in Kabete, Central province, Kenya. One of the first Kikuyu to win a coffee licence, in 1959 he became the first African board member of the Kenya Planters Coffee Union. He died on 14 June 1970. After independence, Harry Thuku Road in Nairobi was named after him.

Based closely on the original U.S. show by the same name, the series premiered on April 5, 2007. The show was created by Simon Fuller (known for the Idol series) and Nigel Lythgoe. The Malaysian entry in the So You Think You Can Dance franchise lasted two seasons and ended in 2008 after crowning champions Muhammad Haslam Abdul Rahman Rubaee (season 1), and Cecilia Yong Li Shi (season 2). Format =Auditions= Preliminary auditions are held in selected locations. Participants who display a good degree of potential to them are recalled to the Callbacks (if their skills are debatable) or qualify directly to the Boot Camp (if they greatly impress the judges during the auditions). =Callbacks= Those who qualify for the callbacks are required to undergo versatility and cohesiveness tests while vying for remaining places in the Boot Camp where there have been participants who have qualified directly from the Auditions. In this sense, versatility discusses participants' ability to project as many styles and techniques of dance as possible. =Boot Camp= Again, contestants who have qualified to this point are given a tougher versatility and cohesiveness which explores their preparedness for the next stage - the live competition. The Boot Camp will be divided into group and individual test sessions. Their emotions and mental strength may be tested as well throughout in preparation for the live competitions. A proportionate number of male and female contestants (usually 10 and 10, respectively) will qualify for the live shows. =Live shows= The most anticipated part of the show witnesses the performances of those who qualified from the Boot Camp live on television. Each show is divided into three sub-events: contestants perform in pairs (one male and one female) to entertain viewers, and at the same time, to be evaluated by a panel of three or four judges; the judges then selected the (four or six, gender- proportionate) worst-performing finalists to vie for survival in the competition by public voting; the one male and one female with the lowest votes leave the competition. Later shows will witness the pairs performing more than one dance routine as the number of finalists decimate along the way. =Grand Finale= At this point, two male and two female finalists remain to vie for public votes and ultimately, the grand prize which only the champion takes home. They may have to perform more routines in a night, including two solo routines and one same-gender pair-up. Guest dancers and singers are also invited to perform. The night closes ceremoniously with the winner announcement. Season 1 The inaugural season of So You Think You Can Dance took off with one audition session in Kuala Lumpur on 16 and 17 March 2007. Out of about 500 people auditioning, seven skipped into the Boot Camp while 80 qualified for the Callbacks. From the eighty, thirty-three joined the Boot Camp to fill in the Top 40 before the judges only allowed 20 to proceed into the live competition. Live shows were held for nine weeks from 3 May till 29 June 2007. Initially, the judges in this stage picked a bottom four for each of the first four weeks, after which the judges decided to select a bottom six to address finalists' competitiveness until the penultimate live show. Noor Fatimah and Mohd Yunus were notably the only contestants to avoid the danger zone until they were cut out of the Grand Finale on week 8. In the Grand Finale on 29 June 2007, Muhammad Haslam Abdul Rahman Rubaee, fondly known as Alam, was declared the winner and clinched RM50,000 cash and a role in one of Tiara Jacquelina's theatre roles. Dennis Yin, Suhaili Micheline and Brancy Tan filled the second, third and fourth places, respectively. Season 2 On 9 March 2008, a day after the Malaysian general elections, auditions for season 2 kicked off in Kota Kinabalu, to be followed by Kuala Lumpur on 18 March. Telecast is scheduled to commence on 1 May.

The counties of Delaware were originally divided into Hundreds based on the English use of dividing up counties. On October 25, 1682, William Penn directed that Delaware be divided into hundreds for the purposes of taxation. A \\"hundred\\" is an old English Saxon land division which is smaller than a county or shire and larger than a tithing. It comprised ten tithings of ten freeholder families each one hundred families. The hundreds of Delaware originally served as judicial or legislative districts, but now they remain only as a basis for property tax assessment. Originally, there were five hundreds in New Castle County, five in Kent County, and two in Sussex County. As the population grew, several of the hundreds divided, creating new hundreds. By 1875, the total number of hundreds had grown to thirty-three. Since then, there have been no more changes. Cedar Creek Hundred was originally known as Cedar Hook Hundred. Before 1683, that part of the Hundred lying north of Cedar Creek formed part of St. Jones County, now known as Kent County. When the Mispillion River was made the northern boundary of Sussex County, the northern part of the present Hundred was consolidated with the southern part lying between Cedar Creek and Primehook Creek.

Claydon currently plays for Sussex County Cricket Club. Career Claydon's debut match came as a tailender batsman for a Yorkshire Second XI against a combined Kent and Middlesex XI. Though neither team were victorious, Claydon proved himself economical with the ball. He later played for the team during a Bangladeshi tour of 2005, which saw a Bangladesh A team play against eight first-class counties. Claydon made his County Championship debut in April of the following year. The match was a rain-affected draw, and Claydon's contribution was negligible. He made more of an impact in a later County Championship game against Durham in which, batting at number ten and scoring 38, he shared a partnership of 80 with centurion Anthony McGrath. Claydon remained within the Yorkshire Second XI during the early stages of the 2006 Second XI Championship, but was released at the end of that season. Following his release from Yorkshire, he signed for Durham in time for the beginning of the 2007 season. It was not until 2009 that Claydon began to make an impact at Durham and took 22 wickets in their championship winning side.

Part songs are commonly sung by an SATB choir, but sometimes for an all-male or all-female ensemble. This music is usually homophonic, meaning that the highest part carries the melody and the other voices or parts supply the accompanying harmonies, in contrast to songs that are contrapuntal, as are madrigals. Part songs are intended to be sung a cappella, that is without accompaniment, unless an instrumental accompaniment is particularly specified. The part song was created in Great Britain, first growing from, and then gradually superseding, the earlier form of glee, as well as being particularly influenced by the choral works of Felix Mendelssohn (1809‚Äì1847). This was linked with the growth of choral societies during the 19th century which were larger groups than glee clubs had been. Early British composers of part songs include John Liptrot Hatton, R. J. S. Stevens, Henry Smart and George Alexander Macfarren, who was renowned for his Shakespearean settings. Around the turn of the 20th century in the heyday of the part song, Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford and Edward Elgar were the principal exponents, often bringing a high-minded seriousness to their settings of great English poetry both contemporary and from earlier epochs. More recent major contributors to the genre include Ralph Vaughan Williams, Granville Bantock, Arnold Bax, Peter Warlock, Gustav Holst and Benjamin Britten. The development of the part song has been marked by increasing complexity of form, and contrapuntal content. Composers have also successfully used the part song medium to make contemporary arrangements of traditional folk songs, including those of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland.

The Society usually holds seven meetings a year in London for members and their guests. The October meeting was traditionally a reception for newly arrived Burmese trainees and students at the start of the academic year in Britain, as the Society has always been concerned to make them feel at home in this country. During recent years however the October reception has become an opportunity for members to meet again after the summer break and to welcome new members. The remaining evening meetings are devoted to lectures, slide and film shows, and reports from recent visitors to Burma. Light refreshments are always served.

It was published in 1978 by Westminster Press in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This book explores women's role in the church today by examining what it was like for woman in the world into which Jesus was born. The authors show how woman was perceived, how she was treated, and how she saw herself. The book describes: * the status of woman in the world Jesus entered; * the position of Jesus with respect to women; and * the status of women in the church as reflected in the New Testament. The three divisions of the book: * Part I describes the Jewish- Greek-Roman world that bears most directly upon the world in which Jesus lived. * Part II is concerned with Jesus' manner, teaching, and post- resurrection appearances to women. * Part III investigates perspectives on woman in the writings of Paul, the early Domestic Code embedded in the New Testament, the Synoptic Gospels, the book of Acts of the Apostles, and the writings of the Apostle John.  Overview  The book opens with an in-depth probe of the ancient world to see how woman fared in the eras leading up to the birth of Jesus. The book is written from a Christian perspective. The basic concern behind the book is to understand the intention of Jesus for woman, in which light the past performance of the church may be tested and directions for the church today may be sought. The authors expressed their intent to make Jesus the heart of the book. Their basic assumption in the book is that the New Testament, in particular the tradition centering in Jesus himself, as revealed in the Synoptic Gospels, remains for Christians their basic and authoritative witness for seeking direction. The Staggs write that although Jesus founded the church, from the first it has struggled to understand him and to follow him. As examples, they cite Jesus' teaching that \\"whoever does the will of God is my mother, and my brother, and my sister,\\" and the proclamation that \\"in Christ there is no male nor female.\\" In marked contrast, in the early Christian church women were told to wear veils when praying or prophesying and to keep silent in church. In the non-canonical Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, Peter says to Jesus: \\"Tell Mary to leave us, \\"for women are not worthy of life.\\" That book was widely circulated in the early church. Many church fathers began to preach that Jesus had died to rid the world of Adam‚Äôs sin. The source of that sin, said the clerics, was Eve. In the third century, the prolific defender of the orthodox church, Tertullian, wrote: \\"On account of [women]‚Ä¶even the Son of God had to die.\\" The Staggs believe that the six antitheses (\\"You have heard it was said...but I say unto you...\\") of are evidence that Jesus intended to correct his heritage.

The episode was co-written by Gabrielle Stanton and Harry Werksman and directed by Paul Lazarus. Plot After seeing her working relationship with Daniel, her close friendship with Christina, and her chance to date Henry all fall apart, Betty is left with no choice but to turn her back on all three, a la \\"Frankenstein\\", this after Daniel tried to ask her about Petra, sees Henry and Charlie argue while trying to get a bagel, and Christina tried to apologize, followed by Hilda climbing into Betty's room after a night out with Santos, which was also noticed the following day by Ignacio after he bought it up. For Betty, however, she starts to realize that she needs them in her life after all, as she questions herself about whether she should forgive them. Even Hilda and Justin thinks she should, after Hilda reminded her of a similar situation when Betty and a friend from high school, Trina DiPaolo, was planning a \\"anti-prom\\" night, until her friend bailed out on Betty after she is asked out. While Betty claimed her story was straight out of Carrie, Hilda told Justin what really happened, since she was there that night. For Daniel, his aftermath of sleeping with Petra and being blackmailed by Lena would force him to either pay them off or relinquish his EIC job to Alexis. This prompted Henry to question him about a $75,000 check just to pay them off. When Henry told Betty about this, she and Henry began to suspect something wasn't right about Petra, and they were right. It appears that earlier in the day Betty saw Petra buy cigarettes after bumping into each other. As Betty confronts Daniel over this and for not trusting her, Daniel finally admitted that he made a mistake, but decided that he will hand over his editor-in-chief (EIC) duties to Alexis after he tells her about this. But just as Alexis was about see Daniel sign his EIC duties away, Betty and Henry see Lena and Petra walk in. After Betty remembers her buying cigarettes at the stand, she and Henry snatched Petra's purse and picked up Petra's ID, which revealed her real age: 20! When Daniel and Alexis saw this, Daniel tore up the contract and remained co-EIC. While Betty might have saved Daniel's job, she is concerned that he hasn't changed as he heads towards the elevator to go home. And as expected Betty found herself back at the center of Henry's attention, as the two celebrated their latest victory. But as they looked at each other, they are unaware that Charlie has walked in and seen them together. Betty also resumed her friendship with Christina and as the two talked, Christina told Betty that she could offer info on Wilhelmina's schemes, if she was interested. Betty also decided to forgive her former high school friend as well. Meanwhile, romance is in the air as Alexis catches the attention of Rodrigo, creative director at MODE Brazil and he asks her out. He is also aware of her being a post-op and to him it doesn't matter anyway. After Wilhelmina tells her that it's time to \\"put the key in the ignition,\\" Alexis finally answers Rodigo's offer, and later on in the evening the two have sex. The following day, Rodrigo asks Alexis about going to Brazil with him, an offer that may prove to be tempting. Unbeknownst to Alexis, Rodrigo is being paid off by Bradford and Wilhelmina (who suggested the idea to him as a way to get back at \\"Little Orphan Tranny\\"), this in exchange for promoting Rodrigo to the EIC job at MODE Brazil by getting Alexis out of the country. This after Bradford offered her $10 million to resign from MODE, leave town, and let Daniel once again take the position of editor-in-chief, which Alexis turned down. Speaking of Wilhelmina and Bradford, it appears that Wilhelmina might have found a new way into Bradford's heart, so after acquiring fake Viagra pills from Marc, she stepped up her plot to lure Bradford in. As the two finish talking to Rodrigo, Bradford reminded Wilhelmina that he won't divorce Claire, but it looks like the \\"pills\\" Bradford took might be working, and Wilhelmina seems to be pleased. Amanda flirts with Tavares, a designer who she believes is gay, after she falls for his exciting fashions, which impresses even Wilhelmina, who turned him away earlier. But as Amanda falls head over heels for him and his designs, she discovers that he is actually a straight guy and that he's using this ruse just to get his designs noticed, which gives Amanda an idea to help him, even as she falls for him. Over at the Suarezes', Santos gives Hilda a little surprise, which is a wedding proposal as he asks her to marry him. The news may be good for Justin, who's happy that he finally proposed to his mother, but Ignacio isn't and will not accept Santos into the family because of his past experiences. However, Hilda does accept. But before that can happen, Ignacio breaks the news to the family that his caseworker has informed him that he'll have to return to Mexico. Production The scene where Betty sees Petra buy cigarettes at the newsstand is actually Downtown Los Angeles; a Los Angeles County MTA bus can be spotted in the background. Also, When Betty enters Daniel's office after discovering that Petra was not 16, you could see the camera through the window's reflection (the window on the right). In this episode, we learned that Henry is a fan of the soap opera All My Children, which is also produced by ABC. However, when he referenced trivia about Erica Kane's daughter Kendall Hart going after Erica's fourth husband (when Erica was a Chandler at the time), Henry was off by two: Kendall was going after Erica's sixth husband (which was Dimitri Marick). The episode also had the working titles \\"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\\" and \\"Petra-Fined.\\"From The Futon Critic (April 2, 2007) Reception Although Entertainment Weekly's Karen Leigh gave the episode high marks, she notes \\"Still, I have a major problem with the fact that so many of its characters ‚Äî Bradford, Walter, even Amanda ‚Äî are totally cardboard.

A top is usually a person who penetrates, a bottom is usually one who receives penetration, and someone who is versatile engages in either or both roles. These terms may be elements of self-identity that indicate an individual's usual preference and habits, but might also describe broader sexual identities and social roles. The terms top and bottom are often used as verbs for the person's actions. The terms do not necessarily refer literally to physical position during sex. Top 19th- century erotic painting depicting Hadrian \\"topping\\" Antinous (detail), by Paul Avril A top is usually a person who engages in the penetrative role during sexual activity; for men who have sex with men (MSMs), this often involves penetration using the penis during anal or oral sex. Top is also used as a verb meaning \\"to penetrate another\\". Top may also describe a broader personal identity involving dominance in a romantic or sexual relationship; however, this stipulation is not a requisite element of being a top. Several related terms exist. With regard to gay male sexuality, a ' is one who assumes an exclusively penetrative role for sex. A ' is one noted for their great skill or aggressiveness in topping. A ' is \\"one who tops under the direction of an eager bottom\\". A ' is one who prefers to top but who bottoms occasionally.Versatile Top. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09. The terms ' or ' are synonyms of top, created to describe the act of penetrating without implying non-egalitarian relations among participants. Trevor Hart of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that self-identified tops were more likely to act as the penetrative partner in other sexual activities (besides anal intercourse), including oral sex and sex toy play. Bottom A bottom is usually the receptive partner during sexual penetration. This frequently refers to MSMs who are penetrated via the anus during anal sex. Bottom is also used as a verb meaning \\"to be penetrated by another, whether anally or orally\\". Bottom may also describe a wider social context of submission within a romantic or sexual relationship, though this element does not apply to all people who prefer to bottom. In gay male sexuality, a total bottom is someone who assumes an exclusively receptive role during anal or oral intercourse. A ' is someone who aggressively enjoys being the receptive partner. A ' is one who prefers to bottom but who tops occasionally.Versatile Bottom. Gaylife.about.com (2012-01-01). Retrieved on 2012-01-09. The term or may be preferred by some. An oral bottom is the exclusively receptive partner in oral sex, providing the penetrative partner, or oral top, with unreciprocated fellatio and irrumatio. Versatile Versatile refers to a person who enjoys both topping and bottoming, or being dominant and submissive, and may alternate between the two in sexual situations.\\"M√§nner, die sowohl passiven als auch aktiven Analsex praktizieren, nennt man versatile.\\" Georg Pfau, Pr√§ventionsmedizin f√ºr den Mann, Linz 2009 Flip-flop or flip fuck commonly describes switching from top to bottom during one sexual encounter between two men. Each participant penetrates the other and is penetrated in his turn. Versatility is a concept of lifestyle. Versatility, though, is not limited to the simple acts of anal, oral, or vaginal penetration, but also includes the splitting of duties and responsibilities in the relationship. According to some, living a versatile lifestyle implies a certain openness to new things and an opposition to labels, stereotypes and generalizations. Therefore, this concept differs from heterosexual relationships where sexual compatibility does not begin with guessing who will end up as top or bottom. In self descriptions of men seeking sex with other men, they may refer to themselves as a versatile top or versatile bottom in addition to other commonly used terms. A 2009 Austrian study on gay pornography has shown that at least 82.4% of all men performing in the male porn industry are versatile at some point during their career. In this study, the performances of 5,556 actors were considered. 10.8% performed only in the top role, 6.8% only as bottoms. The study also found that the actor with the larger penis was more likely to act as the top.Michelides, Christian: M√§nnlichkeitskonstruktionen der Pornografie zur Jahrtausendwende, Wien 2009 Versatility is a common theme of erotic artist Tom of Finland. Prevalence No extensive scientific study has ever been conducted as to firmly determine what percentage of the gay and bisexual male population prefers any given role.

It has since been re-branded as a charity that provides financial aid to students and schools called Bachman Foundation History  The school was founded in 1912 by Reverend John Lynn Bachman, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Sweetwater, Tennessee, as a Mission School for local children in the nearby mountain region of Farner, Tennessee. It was renamed ‚ÄúLynn Bachman Memorial School.‚Äù in 1916, Then, in 1925, the Jonathan W. Bachman Memorial Orphans Home was constructed on the grounds of the school, augmenting the school's mission. Over the years, the school added more cottages to the grounds. In 1934, with the addition of a new public school system in the area, ‚ÄúBachman Home‚Äù was able to refine its focus on providing a home for the children, but using the public schools for educational programs. By 1936, 34 students from Bachman Home were attending the local elementary school and 12 students were attending Ducktown High School. In 1950, the school relocated to a site in Cleveland, Tennessee. By 1970, the Bachman Home expanded to include caring for children who came from less fortunate families in addition to orphans. They sought to keep siblings together and to get them into foster homes or back to their own families as quickly as possible. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bachman Home served as a transitional facility for boys referred from the Department of Corrections and the Department of Human Services, including an alternative school on campus for boys with behavioral problems or who needed additional education before returning to a traditional school setting. In 1999, it was renamed Bachman Academy, and changed its program to one providing for both boys and girls with learning disabilities and began accepting students from other areas of the country. In 2004, the Academy became a SEVIS approved school and was able to accept international students with learning differences as well. By 2011, the school has served students with learning differences from 27 states and 8 countries. Due to sharp decline in enrollment and financial difficulties in later years, the board of trustees made the decision to close the school after the 2016-2017 school year. On May 8, 2017, parents and staff were notified that the school was closing.

Paleozoologists have been able to piece together a more complete outline of the evolutionary lineage of the modern horse than of any other animal. Much of this evolution took place in North America, where horses originated but became extinct about 10,000 years ago. The horse belongs to the order Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), the members of which all share hooved feet and an odd number of toes on each foot, as well as mobile upper lips and a similar tooth structure. This means that horses share a common ancestry with tapirs and rhinoceroses. The perissodactyls arose in the late Paleocene, less than 10 million years after the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. This group of animals appears to have been originally specialized for life in tropical forests, but whereas tapirs and, to some extent, rhinoceroses, retained their jungle specializations, modern horses are adapted to life on drier land, in the much harsher climatic conditions of the steppes. Other species of Equus are adapted to a variety of intermediate conditions. The early ancestors of the modern horse walked on several spread-out toes, an accommodation to life spent walking on the soft, moist grounds of primeval forests. As grass species began to appear and flourish, the equids' diets shifted from foliage to grasses, leading to larger and more durable teeth. At the same time, as the steppes began to appear, the horse's predecessors needed to be capable of greater speeds to outrun predators. This was attained through the lengthening of limbs and the lifting of some toes from the ground in such a way that the weight of the body was gradually placed on one of the longest toes, the third. History of research Extinct equids restored to scale. Left to right: Mesohippus, Neohipparion, Eohippus, Equus scotti and Hypohippus. Wild horses were known since prehistory from central Asia to Europe, with domestic horses and other equids being distributed more widely in the Old World, but no horses or equids of any type were found in the New World when European explorers reached the Americas. When the Spanish colonists brought domestic horses from Europe, beginning in 1493, escaped horses quickly established large feral herds. In the 1760s, the early naturalist Buffon suggested this was an indication of inferiority of the New World fauna, but later reconsidered this idea. William Clark's 1807 expedition to Big Bone Lick found \\"leg and foot bones of the Horses\\", which were included with other fossils sent to Thomas Jefferson and evaluated by the anatomist Caspar Wistar, but neither commented on the significance of this find. The first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir. His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site. During the Beagle survey expedition, the young naturalist Charles Darwin had remarkable success with fossil hunting in Patagonia. On 10 October 1833, at Santa Fe, Argentina, he was \\"filled with astonishment\\" when he found a horse's tooth in the same stratum as fossil giant armadillos, and wondered if it might have been washed down from a later layer, but concluded this was \\"not very probable\\".'Filled with astonishment': an introduction to the St. Fe Notebook, Barlow, Nora (ed. 1945) Charles Darwin and the voyage of the Beagle. London: Pilot Press, p. 210 After the expedition returned in 1836, the anatomist Richard Owen confirmed the tooth was from an extinct species, which he subsequently named Equus curvidens, and remarked, \\"This evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards South America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced into that Continent, is not one of the least interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin's pal√¶ontological discoveries.\\"Darwin, C. R. (ed. 1840). Fossil Mammalia Part 1 No. 4 of The zoology of the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle. By Richard Owen. London: Smith Elder and Co. p. 108‚Äì109 In 1848, a study On the fossil horses of America by Joseph Leidy systematically examined Pleistocene horse fossils from various collections, including that of the Academy of Natural Sciences, and concluded at least two ancient horse species had existed in North America: Equus curvidens and another, which he named Equus americanus. A decade later, however, he found the latter name had already been taken and renamed it Equus complicatus. In the same year, he visited Europe and was introduced by Owen to Darwin.Academy of Natural Sciences - Joseph Leidy - Leidy and Darwin Restoration of Eurohippus parvulus, a mid- to late Eocene equid of Europe (Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin) The original sequence of species believed to have evolved into the horse was based on fossils discovered in North America in 1879 by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. The sequence, from Eohippus to the modern horse (Equus), was popularized by Thomas Huxley and became one of the most widely known examples of a clear evolutionary progression. The horse's evolutionary lineage became a common feature of biology textbooks, and the sequence of transitional fossils was assembled by the American Museum of Natural History into an exhibit that emphasized the gradual, \\"straight-line\\" evolution of the horse. Since then, as the number of equid fossils has increased, the actual evolutionary progression from Eohippus to Equus has been discovered to be much more complex and multibranched than was initially supposed. The straight, direct progression from the former to the latter has been replaced by a more elaborate model with numerous branches in different directions, of which the modern horse is only one of many. George Gaylord Simpson in 1951Simpson, George Gaylord (1951): Horses. Oxford University Press; New Impression edition. (1971 reprint) first recognized that the modern horse was not the \\"goal\\" of the entire lineage of equids,The notion of a goal would contradict modern evolutionary synthesis, but is simply the only genus of the many horse lineages to survive. Detailed fossil information on the distribution and rate of change of new equid species has also revealed that the progression between species was not as smooth and consistent as was once believed. Although some transitions, such as that of Dinohippus to Equus, were indeed gradual progressions, a number of others, such as that of Epihippus to Mesohippus, were relatively abrupt in geologic time, taking place over only a few million years. Both anagenesis (gradual change in an entire population's gene frequency) and cladogenesis (a population \\"splitting\\" into two distinct evolutionary branches) occurred, and many species coexisted with \\"ancestor\\" species at various times. The change in equids' traits was also not always a \\"straight line\\" from Eohippus to Equus: some traits reversed themselves at various points in the evolution of new equid species, such as size and the presence of facial fossae, and only in retrospect can certain evolutionary trends be recognized. Before odd-toed ungulates =Phenacodontidae= Restoration of Phenacodus Phenacodontidae is the most recent family in the order Condylarthra believed to be the ancestral to the odd-toed ungulates. It contains the genera Almogaver, Copecion, Ectocion, Eodesmatodon, Meniscotherium, Ordathspidotherium, Phenacodus and Pleuraspidotherium. The family lived from the Early Paleocene to the Middle Eocene in Europe and were about the size of a sheep, with tails making slightly less than half of the length of their bodies and unlike their ancestors, good running skills for eluding predators. Eocene and Oligocene: early equids =Eohippus= Eohippus appeared in the Ypresian (early Eocene), about 52 mya (million years ago). It was an animal approximately the size of a fox (250-450 mm in height), with a relatively short head and neck and a springy, arched back. It had 44 low-crowned teeth, in the typical arrangement of an omnivorous, browsing mammal: three incisors, one canine, four premolars, and three molars on each side of the jaw. Its molars were uneven, dull, and bumpy, and used primarily for grinding foliage. The cusps of the molars were slightly connected in low crests. Eohippus browsed on soft foliage and fruit, probably scampering between thickets in the mode of a modern muntjac. It had a small brain, and possessed especially small frontal lobes. metacarpal colored) and tooth (, enamel; b, dentin; c, cement) detailed Its limbs were long relative to its body, already showing the beginnings of adaptations for running. However, all of the major leg bones were unfused, leaving the legs flexible and rotatable. Its wrist and hock joints were low to the ground. The forelimbs had developed five toes, of which four were equipped with small proto-hooves; the large fifth \\"toe-thumb\\" was off the ground. The hind limbs had small hooves on three out of the five toes, while the vestigial first and fifth toes did not touch the ground. Its feet were padded, much like a dog's, but with the small hooves in place of claws. For a span of about 20 million years, Eohippus thrived with few significant evolutionary changes. The most significant change was in the teeth, which began to adapt to its changing diet, as these early Equidae shifted from a mixed diet of fruits and foliage to one focused increasingly on browsing foods. During the Eocene, an Eohippus species (most likely Eohippus angustidens) branched out into various new types of Equidae. Thousands of complete, fossilized skeletons of these animals have been found in the Eocene layers of North American strata, mainly in the Wind River basin in Wyoming. Similar fossils have also been discovered in Europe, such as Propalaeotherium (which is not considered ancestral to the modern horse). =Orohippus= Approximately 50 million years ago, in the early-to-middle Eocene, Eohippus smoothly transitioned into Orohippus through a gradual series of changes. Although its name means \\"mountain horse\\", Orohippus was not a true horse and did not live in the mountains. It resembled Eohippus in size, but had a slimmer body, an elongated head, slimmer forelimbs, and longer hind legs, all of which are characteristics of a good jumper. Although Orohippus was still pad-footed, the vestigial outer toes of Eohippus were not present in Orohippus; there were four toes on each fore leg, and three on each hind leg. The most dramatic change between Eohippus and Orohippus was in the teeth: the first of the premolar teeth were dwarfed, the last premolar shifted in shape and function into a molar, and the crests on the teeth became more pronounced. Both of these factors gave the teeth of Orohippus greater grinding ability, suggesting Orohippus ate tougher plant material. =Epihippus= In the mid- Eocene, about 47 million years ago, Epihippus, a genus which continued the evolutionary trend of increasingly efficient grinding teeth, evolved from Orohippus. Epihippus had five grinding, low-crowned cheek teeth with well- formed crests. A late species of Epihippus, sometimes referred to as Duchesnehippus intermedius, had teeth similar to Oligocene equids, although slightly less developed. Whether Duchesnehippus was a subgenus of Epihippus or a distinct genus is disputed. Epihippus was only 2 feet tall. =Mesohippus= In the late Eocene and the early stages of the Oligocene epoch (32-24 mya), the climate of North America became drier, and the earliest grasses began to evolve. The forests were yielding to flatlands, home to grasses and various kinds of brush. In a few areas, these plains were covered in sand, creating the type of environment resembling the present-day prairies.Restoration of Mesohippus In response to the changing environment, the then-living species of Equidae also began to change. In the late Eocene, they began developing tougher teeth and becoming slightly larger and leggier, allowing for faster running speeds in open areas, and thus for evading predators in nonwooded areas. About 40 mya, Mesohippus (\\"middle horse\\") suddenly developed in response to strong new selective pressures to adapt, beginning with the species Mesohippus celer and soon followed by Mesohippus westoni. In the early Oligocene, Mesohippus was one of the more widespread mammals in North America. It walked on three toes on each of its front and hind feet (the first and fifth toes remained, but were small and not used in walking). The third toe was stronger than the outer ones, and thus more weighted; the fourth front toe was diminished to a vestigial nub. Judging by its longer and slimmer limbs, Mesohippus was an agile animal. Mesohippus was slightly larger than Epihippus, about 610 mm (24 in) at the shoulder. Its back was less arched, and its face, snout, and neck were somewhat longer. It had significantly larger cerebral hemispheres, and had a small, shallow depression on its skull called a fossa, which in modern horses is quite detailed. The fossa serves as a useful marker for identifying an equine fossil's species. Mesohippus had six grinding \\"cheek teeth\\", with a single premolar in front--a trait all descendant Equidae would retain. Mesohippus also had the sharp tooth crests of Epihippus, improving its ability to grind down tough vegetation. =Miohippus= Around 36 million years ago, soon after the development of Mesohippus, Miohippus (\\"lesser horse\\") emerged, the earliest species being Miohippus assiniboiensis. As with Mesohippus, the appearance of Miohippus was relatively abrupt, though a few transitional fossils linking the two genera have been found. Mesohippus was once believed to have anagenetically evolved into Miohippus by a gradual series of progressions, but new evidence has shown its evolution was cladogenetic: a Miohippus population split off from the main genus Mesohippus, coexisted with Mesohippus for around four million years, and then over time came to replace Mesohippus.Prothero, D. R. and Shubin, N. (1989). \\"The evolution of Oligocene horses\\". The Evolution of Perissodactyls (pp. 142-175). New York: Clarendon Press. Miohippus was significantly larger than its predecessors, and its ankle joints had subtly changed. Its facial fossa was larger and deeper, and it also began to show a variable extra crest in its upper cheek teeth, a trait that became a characteristic feature of equine teeth. Miohippus ushered in a major new period of diversification in Equidae.Fossil Horses In Cyberspace. Florida Museum of Natural History and the National Science Foundation. Miocene and Pliocene: true equines =Kalobatippus= Megahippus mckennai The forest-suited form was Kalobatippus (or Miohippus intermedius, depending on whether it was a new genus or species), whose second and fourth front toes were long, well-suited travel on the soft forest floors. Kalobatippus probably gave rise to Anchitherium, which travelled to Asia via the Bering Strait land bridge, and from there to Europe. In both North America and Eurasia, larger-bodied genera evolved from Anchitherium: Sinohippus in Eurasia and Hypohippus and Megahippus in North America. Hypohippus became extinct by the late Miocene. =Parahippus= The Miohippus population that remained on the steppes is believed to be ancestral to Parahippus, a North American animal about the size of a small pony, with a prolonged skull and a facial structure resembling the horses of today. Its third toe was stronger and larger, and carried the main weight of the body. Its four premolars resembled the molar teeth; the first were small and almost nonexistent. The incisor teeth, like those of its predecessors, had a crown (like human incisors); however, the top incisors had a trace of a shallow crease marking the beginning of the core/cup. =Merychippus= Merychippus, an effective grazer and runner In the middle of the Miocene epoch, the grazer Merychippus flourished. It had wider molars than its predecessors, which are believed to have been used for crunching the hard grasses of the steppes. The hind legs, which were relatively short, had side toes equipped with small hooves, but they probably only touched the ground when running. Merychippus radiated into at least 19 additional grassland species. =Hipparion= Protohippus simus Three lineages within Equidae are believed to be descended from the numerous varieties of Merychippus: Hipparion, Protohippus and Pliohippus. The most different from Merychippus was Hipparion, mainly in the structure of tooth enamel: in comparison with other Equidae, the inside, or tongue side, had a completely isolated parapet. A complete and well-preserved skeleton of the North American Hipparion shows an animal the size of a small pony. They were very slim, rather like antelopes, and were adapted to life on dry prairies. On its slim legs, Hipparion had three toes equipped with small hooves, but the side toes did not touch the ground. In North America, Hipparion and its relatives (Cormohipparion, Nannippus, Neohipparion, and Pseudhipparion), proliferated into many kinds of equids, at least one of which managed to migrate to Asia and Europe during the Miocene epoch. (European Hipparion differs from American Hipparion in its smaller body size - the best-known discovery of these fossils was near Athens.) =Pliohippus= Pliohippus pernix Pliohippus arose from Callippus in the middle Miocene, around 12 mya. It was very similar in appearance to Equus, though it had two long extra toes on both sides of the hoof, externally barely visible as callused stubs. The long and slim limbs of Pliohippus reveal a quick-footed steppe animal. Until recently, Pliohippus was believed to be the ancestor of present-day horses because of its many anatomical similarities. However, though Pliohippus was clearly a close relative of Equus, its skull had deep facial fossae, whereas Equus had no fossae at all. Additionally, its teeth were strongly curved, unlike the very straight teeth of modern horses. Consequently, it is unlikely to be the ancestor of the modern horse; instead, it is a likely candidate for the ancestor of Astrohippus. =Dinohippus= Dinohippus was the most common species of Equidae in North America during the late Pliocene. It was originally thought to be monodactyl, but a 1981 fossil find in Nebraska shows some were tridactyl. =Plesippus= Mounted skeleton of Hagerman horse (Equus simplicidens) Plesippus is often considered an intermediate stage between Dinohippus and the extant genus, Equus. The famous fossils found near Hagerman, Idaho were originally thought to be a part of the genus Plesippus. Hagerman Fossil Beds (Idaho) is a Pliocene site, dating to about 3.5 mya. The fossilized remains were originally called Plesippus shoshonensis, but further study by paleontologists determined the fossils represented the oldest remains of the genus Equus. Their estimated average weight was 425 kg, roughly the size of an Arabian horse. At the end of the Pliocene, the climate in North America began to cool significantly and most of the animals were forced to move south. One population of Plesippus moved across the Bering land bridge into Eurasia around 2.5 mya. Modern horses =Equus= Skull of a giant extinct horse, Equus eisenmannae The genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged Equus livenzovensis documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate the most recent common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9‚Äì7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the kulan, onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2‚Äì6.5) million years ago. Pleistocene horse fossils have been assigned to a multitude of species, with over 50 species of equines described from the Pleistocene of North America alone, although the taxonomic validity of most of these has been called into question. Recent genetic work on fossils has found evidence for only three genetically divergent equid lineages in Pleistocene North and South America. These results suggest all North American fossils of caballine-type horses (which also include the domesticated horse and Przewalski's horse of Europe and Asia), as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus E. (Amerhippus) belong to the same species: E. ferus. Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped as New World stilt-legged horses (including H. francisci, E. tau, E. quinni and potentially North American Pleistocene fossils previously attributed to E. cf. hemiones, and E. (Asinus) cf. kiang) probably all belong to a second species endemic to North America, which despite a superficial resemblance to species in the subgenus E. (Asinus) (and hence occasionally referred to as North American ass) is closely related to E. ferus. Surprisingly, the third species, endemic to South America and traditionally referred to as Hippidion, originally believed to be descended from Pliohippus, was shown to be a third species in the genus Equus, closely related to the New World stilt-legged horse. The temporal and regional variation in body size and morphological features within each lineage indicates extraordinary intraspecific plasticity. Such environment-driven adaptative changes would explain why the taxonomic diversity of Pleistocene equids has been overestimated on morphoanatomical grounds. According to these results, it appears the genus Equus evolved from a Dinohippus-like ancestor ~4‚Äì7 mya. It rapidly spread into the Old World and there diversified into the various species of asses and zebras. A North American lineage of the subgenus E. (Equus) evolved into the New World stilt-legged horse (NWSLH). Subsequently, populations of this species entered South America as part of the Great American Interchange shortly after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, and evolved into the form currently referred to as Hippidion ~2.5 million years ago. Hippidion is thus only distantly related to the morphologically similar Pliohippus, which presumably became extinct during the Miocene. Both the NWSLH and Hippidium show adaptations to dry, barren ground, whereas the shortened legs of Hippidion may have been a response to sloped terrain. In contrast, the geographic origin of the closely related modern E. ferus is not resolved. However, genetic results on extant and fossil material of Pleistocene age indicate two clades, potentially subspecies, one of which had a holarctic distribution spanning from Europe through Asia and across North America and would become the founding stock of the modern domesticated horse. The other population appears to have been restricted to North America. However, one or more North American populations of E. ferus entered South America ~1.0‚Äì1.5 million years ago, leading to the forms currently known as E. (Amerhippus), which represent an extinct geographic variant or race of E. ferus. =Genome sequencing= Early sequencing studies of DNA revealed several genetic characteristics of Przewalski's horse that differ from what is seen in modern domestic horses, indicating neither is ancestor of the other, and supporting the status of Przewalski horses as a remnant wild population not derived from domestic horses. The evolutionary divergence of the two populations was estimated to have occurred about 45,000 YBP, while the archaeological record places the first horse domestication about 5,500 YBP by the ancient central-Asian Botai culture. The two lineages thus split well before domestication, probably due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. Several subsequent DNA studies produced partially contradictory results. A 2009 molecular analysis using ancient DNA recovered from archaeological sites placed Przewalski's horse in the middle of the domesticated horses, but a 2011 mitochondrial DNA analysis suggested that Przewalski's and modern domestic horses diverged some 160,000 years ago.O A Ryder, A R Fisher, B Schultz, S Kosakovsky Pond, A Nekrutenko, K D Makova. \\"A massively parallel sequencing approach uncovers ancient origins and high genetic variability of endangered Przewalski's horses\\". Genome Biology and Evolution. 2011 An analysis based on whole genome sequencing and calibration with DNA from old horse bones gave a divergence date of 38‚Äì72 thousand years ago. In June 2013, a group of researchers announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560‚Äì780 thousand year old horse, using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in permafrost in Canada's Yukon territory. Before this publication, the oldest nuclear genome that had been successfully sequenced was dated at 110‚Äì130 thousand years ago. For comparison, the researchers also sequenced the genomes of a 43,000-year-old Pleistocene horse, a Przewalski's horse, five modern horse breeds, and a donkey. Analysis of differences between these genomes indicated that the last common ancestor of modern horses, donkeys, and zebras existed 4 to 4.5 million years ago. The results also indicated that Przewalski's horse diverged from other modern types of horse about 43,000 years ago, and had never in its evolutionary history been domesticated. A new analysis in 2018 involved genomic sequencing of ancient DNA from mid-fourth-millennium B.C.E. Botai domestic horses, as well as domestic horses from more recent archaeological sites, and comparison of these genomes with those of modern domestic and Przewalski's horses. The study revealed that Przewalski's horses not only belong to the same genetic lineage as those from the Botai culture, but were the feral descendants of these ancient domestic animals, rather than representing a surviving population of never-domesticated horses. The Botai horses were found to have made only negligible genetic contribution to any of the other ancient or modern domestic horses studied, which must then have arisen from an independent domestication involving a different wild horse population. The karyotype of Przewalski's horse differs from that of the domestic horse by an extra chromosome pair because of the fission of domestic horse chromosome 5 to produce the Przewalski's horse chromosomes 23 and 24. In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and zebras include numerous translocations, fusions, inversions and centromere repositioning. This gives Przewalski's horse the highest diploid chromosome number among all equine species. They can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring (65 chromosomes). =Pleistocene extinctions= Digs in western Canada have unearthed clear evidence horses existed in North America until about 12,000 years ago. However, all Equidae in North America ultimately became extinct. The causes of this extinction (simultaneous with the extinctions of a variety of other American megafauna) have been a matter of debate. Given the suddenness of the event and because these mammals had been flourishing for millions of years previously, something quite unusual must have happened. The first main hypothesis attributes extinction to climate change. For example, in Alaska, beginning approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants. The other hypothesis suggests extinction was linked to overexploitation by newly arrived humans of naive prey that were not habituated to their hunting methods. The extinctions were roughly simultaneous with the end of the most recent glacial advance and the appearance of the big game-hunting Clovis culture.\\"Ice Age Horses May Have Been Killed Off by Humans\\" National Geographic News, May 1, 2006. Several studies have indicated humans probably arrived in Alaska at the same time or shortly before the local extinction of horses. Additionally, it has been proposed that the steppe-tundra vegetation transition in Beringia may have been a consequence, rather than a cause, of the extinction of megafaunal grazers. In Eurasia, horse fossils began occurring frequently again in archaeological sites in Kazakhstan and the southern Ukraine about 6,000 years ago. From then on, domesticated horses, as well as the knowledge of capturing, taming, and rearing horses, probably spread relatively quickly, with wild mares from several wild populations being incorporated en route. =Return to the Americas= Horses only returned to the Americas with Christopher Columbus in 1493. These were Iberian horses first brought to Hispaniola and later to Panama, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and, in 1538, Florida. The first horses to return to the main continent were 16 specifically identified horses brought by Hern√°n Cort√©s. Subsequent explorers, such as Coronado and De Soto, brought ever-larger numbers, some from Spain and others from breeding establishments set up by the Spanish in the Caribbean. Later, as Spanish missions were founded on the mainland, horses would eventually be lost or stolen, and proliferated into large herds of feral horses that became known as mustangs. The indigenous peoples of the Americas did not have a specific word for horses, and came to refer to them in various languages as a type of dog or deer (in one case, \\"elk-dog\\", in other cases \\"big dog\\" or \\"seven dogs\\", referring to the weight each animal could pull). Details =Toes= The ancestors of the horse came to walk only on the end of the third toe and both side (second and fourth) \\"toes\\". Skeletal remnants show obvious wear on the back of both sides of metacarpal and metatarsal bones, commonly called the \\"splint bones\\". They are the remnants of the second and the fourth toes. Modern horses retain the splint bones; they are often believed to be useless attachments, but they in fact play an important role in supporting the carpal joints (front knees) and even the tarsal joints (hocks). =Teeth= Throughout the phylogenetic development, the teeth of the horse underwent significant changes. The type of the original omnivorous teeth with short, \\"bumpy\\" molars, with which the prime members of the evolutionary line distinguished themselves, gradually changed into the teeth common to herbivorous mammals. They became long (as much as 100 mm), roughly cubical molars equipped with flat grinding surfaces. In conjunction with the teeth, during the horse's evolution, the elongation of the facial part of the skull is apparent, and can also be observed in the backward-set eyeholes. In addition, the relatively short neck of the equine ancestors became longer, with equal elongation of the legs. Finally, the size of the body grew as well. =Coat color= Reconstruction of possible ancestral coat colors. The ancestral coat color of E. ferus was possible a uniform dun, consistent with modern populations of Przewalski's horses. Pre-domestication variants including black and spotted have been inferred from cave wall paintings and confirmed by genomic analysis. Domestication may have also led to more varieties of coat colors.

The book mainly examines the controversy over the identification of the flag-raiser who was positioned at the base of the flagpole in Joe Rosenthal's Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima photograph of the second flag-raising on February 23, 1945. Overview Though the authors cover and debunk the various staging myths that have haunted the famous photograph of six men (three were later killed in action after the flag was raised) raising the flag, much of the book is devoted to the story of Sergeant Hank Hansen who was first identified and believed to be in Rosenthal's famous photograph which became the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial that was completed in 1954. Hansen was a member of the 40-man combat patrol mostly from Third Platoon, E Company, 28th Marines, that climbed up Mount Suribachi and raised the first of two flags atop Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945. After the battle of Iwo Jima, Hansen (killed in action on March 1) was incorrectly identified as a flag-raiser in the photograph by E Company's runner (messenger) during the battle, Rene Gagnon, who helped raise the second flag. E Company's Third Platoon corpsman, John Bradley (incorrectly named a second flag-raiser),USMC Statement on Marine Corps Flag Raisers, Office of U.S. Marine Corps Communication, 23 June 2016 also misidentified Hansen as a second flag-raiser. Marine Ira Hayes was the only second flag-raiser (Gagnon, Hayes, and Block were not members of the 40-man patrol) who correctly said the person in the photograph thought to be Hansen was really Corporal Harlon Block. Block was not officially recognized as a second flag-raiser until January 1947. Ira Hayes questions misidentification Recounted is the story of how Ira Hayes (a surviving second-flag-raiser named by Gagnon) knew that it was actually Corporal Harlon Block and not Hansen in Rosenthal's photograph (Block and Hansen were both killed in action on Iwo Jima, on March 1, 1945), and tried to bring the \\"error\\" to the attention of the Marine Corps lieutenant colonel who was interviewing him about the flag-raising in April 1945 (same person interviewed Gagnon on April 7, and days later, Bradley), in Washington, D.C., before the May 11, 7th War Loan drive (7th bond selling tour; Gagnon, Hayes, and Bradley were to take the actual second-flag with them to 33 U.S. cities across America to sell bonds to help pay for the war) but was told that since both Hansen and Block names were already released publicly as being flag-raisers in the photograph by the Marine Corps (on April 8) and since both were deceased, he should let it go (Hayes was ordered back to E Company in Hawaii on April 24 and left April 25 before the bond tour ended on July 4). Their story differs from that of most Hayes biographers as they transcribe a letter which Hayes wrote to Belle Block (Harlon's mother) on July 12, 1946, confirming it was her son Harlon in the photograph (after she first wrote to him). The authors' do not mention the \\"hitchhiking to Texas to tell them the truth\\" story. After Belle Block sent Hayes' letter to her congressman through Mr. Block in September 1946, the congressman wrote the Marine Corps asking them to look into the matter. Hayes (second flag-raisers Hayes, Block, Michael Strank, and Franklin Sousley were members of Second Platoon, E Company) gave an affidavit listing the names of the six flag-raisers (including Bradley) in the photograph to the Marine Corps during their investigation the following December (began on December 4) into the identities of the six flag-raisers in Rosenthal's photograph, stating on the record that it was actually Block and not Hansen in the photograph, and pointed out several significant uniform discrepancies between the figure in the famous photograph and that of Hansen in photographs taken earlier that day and in Rosenthal's \\"Gung Ho\\" photograph of several Marines (sixteen Marines and two corpsmen) including Hansen (wearing his cap and parachutist boots) under the second flag/flagstaff taken only moments after the second flag-raising. Before seeing Hayes' hand-written notes and identifications on the photographs, both Gagnon and Bradley sent notarized statements reaffirming their earlier identification of Hansen. After being shown Hayes' material, Bradley wrote a letter to the investigators which he ended by saying, \\"...it could be Block.\\" Hayes' material and Bradley's letter were then sent to Gagnon, who, according to this book, gave in and acquiesced in a letter, the first paragraph of which was copied word-for-word from Bradley's. Conclusion On January 15, 1947, the Marine Corps appointed investigating board found that the figure at the base of the flagpole in the photograph had been \\"incorrectly identified since April 8, 1945, as being Sergeant Henry O. Hansen.\\" Furthermore, they stated that \\"to the best of the ability of the Board to determine at this time, the above-mentioned figure is that of Corporal Harlan [sic] H. Block.\\" Albee and Freeman conclude that it is ultimately impossible to tell, based only on the photographic evidence, who is at the base of the flagpole.

It was broadcast live from CNBC Asia's Australia studio in Sydney, and anchored by Amanda Drury. It was produced by CNBC Asia from Australia. It was also seen in the United States on the CNBC World channel at 6:00pm ET (with Daylight Saving Time) or 5:00pm ET (without DST). On Sundays, it was simulcasted on CNBC Europe at 22.00 UK time (without DST) or 23.00 CET time (with DST). The show was filmed on the floor of the exchange in front of one of the largest videowalls in the Southern Hemisphere. Jeffrey James was the original anchor of Squawk Australia until his departure from the network in October 2008. It was announced in early 2010 that Squawk Australia will be cancelled as part of a programming revamp at the network on 14 June 2010. This is also due to the relocation of Karen Tso to Singapore, and Amanda Drury to CNBC headquarters in the U.S. About the show Squawk Australia premiered on CNBC Asia on 26 March 2007 as part of the Asia firm's significant programming overhaul. It replaced the first hour of Asia Squawk Box, which was then seen an hour later. The show looked ahead to the Australian trading day with locally based analysts and fund managers, as well as recapping overnight trade in the U.S. and providing currency and world news updates. Weather forecasts were provided by The Weather Channel (formerly NBC Weather Plus). CNBC reporter Sri Jegarajah frequently contributed to the program from Singapore. The program was initially broadcast from a camera position in the General Electric offices near the Sydney Harbour Bridge as an interim measure. A move to a new studio in the Burns Philp building, opposite to the Australian Stock Exchange, took place in October 2007 as the network expanded its Australian output. This was three months later than originally planned. Anchor change and program revamp In August 2008, CNBC announced that Karen Tso from Channel Nine will be joining the network as its new Australia-based anchor.

She earned three battle stars during the war and was decommissioned in July 1946. In July 1955, she was assigned the name USS Bledsoe County (LST-356) in honor of Bledsoe County, Tennessee, but never saw active service under that name. Bledsoe County was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in September 1960 and sold for scrapping in March 1961. She was apparently sold into commercial service in 1962 instead, serving under several names over the next five years. In 1967, she was acquired by the Indonesian Navy and renamed KRI Teluk Tomini (508). In 2012, the ship has pensioned and scrapped as scrap metal. Service history LST-356 was laid down on 7 September 1942 at the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 16 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harold Rivington Parker; and commissioned on 22 December 1942 with Lieutenant George A. Jacquemot, USNR, in command. =Mediterranean, 1943-1944= Following shakedown in Chesapeake Bay and post-shakedown repairs at the New York Navy Yard, LST-356 set out for the coast of Africa on 19 March 1943. She stopped at Bermuda between 23 and 27 March and reached Senegal on 13 April. From there, she moved north and entered the Mediterranean Sea. For the next few weeks, she conducted shuttle runs between ports on the North African coast (Oran, Arzew, Tunis, and Bizerte) before she took part in \\"Operation Husky\\" - the invasion of Sicily. For that assault, she beached at Beach Blue Two, in the \\"Cent\\" area on the afternoon of 10 July and unloaded her embarked tanks and other vehicles within an hour. Then, she turned to the task of unloading ammunition, gasoline, and general stores until directed to retract and lie to offshore. During the retraction phase, though, LST-356 grounded on a sandbar on her port bow, rupturing a fuel tank in the auxiliary engine room. However, she managed to struggle free under her own power in about 20 minutes and then proceeded to the transport area. The following day, she resumed unloading, using her boats in the effort. Later, on the 12th, she assisted the in unloading her cargo despite frequent interruptions by enemy air raids. Beaching again on the 13th, the tank landing ship, helped by Army engineers, started to unload the remainder of her own cargo, and her crew completed the job on the 14th. Over the ensuing weeks, LST-356 voyaged thrice to Sicilian ports bringing supplies into Scoglitti, Gela, and Palermo. During this time, she also carried a cargo of radar equipment and night fighter directing gear to the island of Ustica, some north-northwest of Palermo. Before the year was out, the ship took part in her second amphibious action, \\"Operation Avalanche\\", the invasion at Salerno, Italy. She arrived in the Gulf of Salerno on D-Day, 9 September, and immediately commenced discharging DUKWs. Upon completing this task some 40 minutes later, she lay to, ramp and bow doors secured, to await orders. During that period of inactivity, enemy planes appeared overhead, and the tank landing ship‚Äôs gunners joined in the fire to drive them off. LST-356 launched pontoons and arrived off the beaching area at noon. She approached the beach under fire from shore batteries. Unloading her vehicles swiftly, LST-356, still under fire, retracted from the beach without difficulty suffering neither damage nor casualties. After retrieving her boats and embarking German prisoners of war, she returned to the rendezvous area. Underway again, LST-356, configured with a \\"flight deck,\\" began launching the first of four United States Army Piper L-4A \\"Grasshoppers\\" for liaison missions. As she increased speed to flank, the first L-4A took off, but narrowly missed the guardrail to the forecastle-mounted 40-millimeter mount. The second took off two minutes later, but it struck the guardrail and fell into the sea off the starboard bow. Executing hard right rudder and stopping her engines, LST-356 swung to starboard to avoid running down the splashed \\"Grasshopper.\\" Fortunately, a boat from the picked up the Army pilot, and the attack transport took him on board and treated his injuries. Determining the runway to be faulty, Lieutenant Jacquemot and the officer in charge of the planes decided against launching the other two L-4As. For the rest of the day and throughout the night, LST-356 remained in the vicinity, her crew at general quarters because of periodic enemy air attacks. On the 10th, LST-356 set out in convoy for Bizerte and thereafter conducted follow-up trips from Bizerte to Salerno; Tripoli to Salerno; and Bizerte to Taranto, lifting both American and British troops and equipment. While engaged in one such mission on 15 September, LST-356 came under \\"extremely heavy enemy shore-based gunfire\\" off Green Beach in the northern attack area. Shells landed on both sides of the ship, under the stern and on the beach immediately off the ramp; but, except for a British Army passenger who suffered a severe leg wound, those embarked in LST-356 again came through without a scratch. =Invasion of France, 1944-1945= Leaving the Mediterranean in the fall of 1943, LST-356 proceeded to England where she spent the ensuing months refitting and training for the Normandy invasion. While not part of the initial phase of \\"Operation Neptune,\\" she did take part in follow-up action. She sortied from the Thames in convoy, and arrived off Sword Beach early on the evening of 14 June, streaming her barrage balloon \\"to lethal height,\\" and made smoke during dusk and evening hours. Although sporadic air attacks punctuated the night, she withheld her fire in accordance with instructions from the beachhead commander. The following day, LST-356 and six other American LST's received orders to proceed to \\"Queen Red\\" beach. An hour after high tide, the tank landing ship still had of water at the ramp's end, making it obvious \\"...that we would have to dry out in order to discharge our troops and vehicles.\\" About an hour later, while waiting for the tide to recede, LST-356 observed shellfire down the beach, from the direction of the Orne River, where the Germans were known to have placed artillery batteries. Within half an hour, the fire crept up the beach and began to fall close aboard. For the next four hours, LST-356 lay exposed to the enemy guns, unable to return fire in her own defense since her 3-inch gun had been removed during the recent refit. Around noon, the tide had withdrawn enough to permit unloading; but a shell crater directly in front of the ramp held that task up until a woven steel mat was bridged the hole and allowed the first of 47 Canadian Army vehicles to cross it shoreward. Lieutenant Blanco made all passengers take cover behind the superstructure or under the trucks, and ordered his crew to remain under cover as much as their duties permitted. As a result, there were no casualties. Within 50 minutes of the start, all vehicles had left the ship, and LST-356 proceeded to the anchorage. A short time later, however, more long-range enemy shelling compelled her to move back out to sea, but not before a shell had whistled directly over her bow and penetrated the side of . In all, five LSTs took hits from the German guns and suffered damage. Between June 1944 and April 1945, LST-356 carried 39 loads of men and material across the English Channel. =Decommissioning and sale, 1945-1960= Sent home in May 1945 for a thorough overhaul, she remained at the Hoboken, New Jersey yards of the Bethlehem Steel Company, undergoing repairs and alterations until the end of July 1945. Clearing New York on 9 August, LST-356 conducted post-overhaul shakedown in Chesapeake Bay until late August. The tank landing ship then visited New York City from 21 to 29 August. At the end of August, she sailed from New York on her way to deactivation in Florida. Pausing at Hampton Roads from 30 August to 13 September, the tank landing ship continued via Morehead City, North Carolina to Jacksonville, Florida. Reporting to the 16th Fleet on 26 September 1945 LST-356 was decommissioned on 2 July 1946 and was berthed with the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida. Although named USS Bledsoe County (LST-356) on 1 July 1955 the tank landing ship never returned to active service. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1960 and she was sold to the Mechanical Equipment Company of New Orleans on 8 March 1961 for scrapping. LST-356 earned three battle stars during World War II.

It is about the suburban sprawl and the Moss family's life in the suburbs. The film is openly critical towards suburban sprawl and its negative effects, being ironic and amusing at the same time. It was revealed to be a mockumentary at the end of the film. The fictional part is about the five members of the Moss family who have just moved from the city into a new suburban development of Evergreen (part of Evergreen) in Calgary, Alberta. The family discuss and portray the life in the suburbs and the various flaws and advantages of a modern suburban life, with a considerably greater emphasis on the flaws. While the characters and instances in the movie are fictional, the actors that play them all live in real suburban areas. Interspersed with this narrative, experts speak about their views of the suburbs. These include Ken Greenberg, Joseph Heath, Mark Kingwell, James Howard Kunstler, Marc Boutin, Andr√©s Duany and Beverly Sandalack. These portions are filmed in different suburban areas of North America, including Oakville, Ontario. Plot The Moss family decides to move from the inner city of Calgary to a suburban area called Evergreen to satisfy Ann Moss's desire of living in a new house. Her husband, Evan Moss, is still keeping his job downtown, which forces him to consume two hours of commuting time. Apparently, even if the area offers everything that is needed by a family in walking distance, one is isolated due to constructions, buildings, distance, and the area layout and is constantly forced to rely on the car for every little need. The family carries on its ordinary life with Ann having a positive opinion of their new life and Evan and the kids can see more clearly on the flaws and disadvantages of this lifestyle. However, they go along with it, constantly trying to find their way to justify their choice.

The district consists of the city of Huari, 15 small villages and 22 annexes. History Tradition says that Huari was founded by Ju√°n Huar√≠n. The foundation corresponded to the viceroyalty of Francisco de Toledo, Count of Oropesa in 1572, and was founded under the name of Santo Domingo de Huari. Its creation as a district was carried out during the Peruvian War of Independence. Geography The Cordillera Blanca traverses the western part of the district. The highest peak of the district is Rurichinchay at . Other mountains are listed below:escale.minedu.gob.pe - UGEL map of the Huari Province (Ancash Region) Located on the western skirts of the eastern mountain range in the Callej√≥n de Conchucos valley (running parallel to the Callej√≥n de Huaylas valley) Huari is characterised by its unique panoramas. The Mosna River feeds the Mara√±√≥n River, which, in turn, gives birth to the Amazon River. The Huari District is located 3,149 meters above sea level. Demographics The district occupies an area of 398.91 km2 and its population according to the Peru 1993 Census was of 8,915 inhabitants. Politics The capital of the district is the city of Huari, which is also the provincial capital of Huari.  Ethnic groups  The people in the district are mainly indigenous citizens of Quechua descent. Quechua is the language which the majority of the population (65.75%) learnt to speak in childhood, while 33.60% of the residents started speaking using the Spanish language (2007 Peru Census).inei.gob.pe INEI, Peru, Censos Nacionales 2007, Frequencias: Preguntas de Poblaci√≥n: Idioma o lengua con el que aprendi√≥ hablar (in Spanish) Religious figures and holidays Haurinos holy patron include the Virgin of the Rosary (the Huarina Virgin is called to him), whose supervisory celebration is celebrated on the 7 of October, and Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n. Additional religious festivals include Easter and Corpus Christi. Local food Huarinos, in the region, are also referred to as mishi kanka, (Quechua for \\"roasted cat\\"). That is to say that Huarinos are people who eat roasted cat. Other traditional plates of the district include sharp of guinea pig (traditional plate of the mountain culinaria of Peru) and the Llajhuari. The Llajhuari is a plate of Huari, and is a precursory of buffets; it consists of a mini-buffet of several \\"sharp ones\\" served on one plate (generally made of wood, called p'uku, Quechua for plate), accompanied, of course, of \\"poto\\" (vasija of pumpkin or zapallo) of chicha of jora. The word llajhuari, translated from Spanish, would mean: \\"something worthy to be licked\\". Flora and fauna Huari's unique flora and fauna include the waqanku (Masdevallia amabilis), condors, pumas and the \\"spectacled\\" bear. People Eleazar Guzm√°n Barr√≥n was a local biochemist who in 1942 was called by the Government of the United States to join the United States Atomic Energy Commission, overseeing the study and development of the atomic pump.

He served as the chief of the Metro Toronto Police Force from 1980 to 1984. Known as an ideas man, and 'kind cop' he introduced community policing when he was the deputy chief. Though later, during his term as the chief, the biggest mass civilian arrest since the Second World War occurred in Toronto's Gay district. Following his retirement from the police force, he was head of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario from 1984 to 1990, where he modernized the retail operations and its marketing. Policing career Jack Ackroyd joined the Toronto Police Department as cadet, in 1941. He rose through the ranks and by the mid 1970s, was a deputy police chief. During this period he earned the nickname \\"Kojak\\", after the 1970s TV show and character Kojak. One of his biggest accomplishments was introducing \\"community policing\\" to the Metro force in the late 1970s. This so-called \\"more humane\\" style of policing was lauded by the media and politicians alike. Ackroyd will be remembered for this major innovation and for the following dark incidents that occurred on his watch. = 1977 Yonge Street clean-up = During the spring and summer of 1977, Toronto's city and metro councils were under pressure to do something about the sex trade and sex shops that were housed in the area along Yonge street from Queen to Bloor streets following the death of the twelve-year-old shoe-shine boy, Emanuel Jaques.Beare, p.25 The crisis was more political than real; nevertheless, under pressure from Toronto mayor David Crombie, Ackroyd had to plan and implement a neighbourhood sweep on the scale of the 1968 Yorkville sweep.Beare, p.26 Like in the Yorkville \\"crisis\\", Yonge street did not pose a major policing problem. The police were not raising a fuss for something to be done, it was the politicians, this time led by Crombie.Beare, p.24 Another factor driving this sweep was economic, as the newly opened Eaton Centre did not want this 'riff-raff' near its business establishment. So, over the course of a few months, Ackroyd ‚Äì following the political directives issued by city council and the provincial government ‚Äì ordered his officers to step up their patrols on this commercial strip and forced the closure of many shops and arrested prostitutes and their clients.Beare, p. 28 = 1981 Bathhouse raids = Jack Ackroyd became the Metro Force's Chief of Police in 1980 following the tenure of Harold Adamson (police chief). Again political ‚Äì not policing ‚Äì concerns overshadowed how the Gay Community around the Church and Wellesly area should be monitored. Ackroyd, in an interview with the Toronto Star, talked about the political pressure he was under to do something about the so- called problem: On February 5, 1981, under his reign as police chief, one of Canada's largest civilian round-ups occurred in the city's gay ghetto. It was the infamous \\"Bathhouse raids\\" and as the CBC reported \\"the largest mass arrest in Canada since the October Crisis of 1970.\\" Over 300 people were arrested and Ackroyd defended it by the fact that there were several criminal code violations and that he \\"...as Chief, have no other course of action but to go along with the direction of the Crown Attorney.\\" Large protests followed these raids, and the raids became a rallying symbol for the Gay community.Beare, p.29 Because the raids took place in the middle of a provincial election, it was seen by many observers including the Toronto Star, that the raids were politically motivated to help the ruling Conservative government gain a majority. Jack Ackroyd's term saw the chief's role increasingly politicized. Two years later, in another interview with the Star, Ackroyd even agrees that the chief's job has become too politicized. His career was an interesting dichotomy of progressive reform with the community- based policing approach, as well as accusations that the police force became an instrument for political advantage as seen in his handling of the policing of the Gay community.Beare, pp.24‚Äì32 Post Police Chief career =Head of the LCBO= At the age of 58, Jack Ackroyd made a career change: he became an Ontario Civil Servant, by accepting the position of vice-chairman of the LCBO. In quick succession, he became the chairman of the public sector corporation, and immediately set about reforming it. Under his watch, the LCBO launched Project Image, which improved the retail end of its operations in many ways. He was responsible for ordering the redesign of the board's logo ‚Äì which was in use until the early 2000s ‚Äì to a burgundy and gold design. To improve the image of the retail locations, he made sure that newly designed uniforms were issued to sales staff. In an effort to bring more modern in-store marketing techniques, he authorized store managers to mount discreet product displays. General marketing outside the retail locations was modernized to include bus shelter posters and other forms of advertising. Ackroyd also made the visibility of the higher quality Vintages stores more known and important. His term as the LCBO's chairman can be summarized as bringing the board from a Prohibition-era government substance control agency, to a modern, customer- friendly corporation that made billions of dollars for the Ontario Government. Ackroyd hadn't completely abandoned his policing background during this time though. He made sure his policing legacy would endure by donating the funds for an \\"academic excellence in police related studies\\" prize, administered by the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police Research Foundation. Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police Research Foundation ‚Äì Jack Ackroyd Scholarship =Sickness and death= Ackroyd spent many months confined to a hospital bed due to a blood illness. He died in the early morning hours of September 30, 1992 at Toronto General Hospital from long-term complications due to the blood disorder. His funeral was held on October 3, 1992, at Timothy Eaton Memorial Church, a house of worship accustomed to holding the city's notable funeral services. An official tribute, on the floor of the Ontario Legislature, by Bob Runciman, the MPP for Leeds‚ÄîGrenville, stated that \\"Jack Ackroyd set an example that continues to be the goal of Metro's men and women in blue.

Montoro (born 1928) was an American film producer and distributor known for releasing exploitation films and B-movies during the 1970s and 1980s through his company Film Ventures International. Montoro became notorious for producing and promoting films such as Beyond the Door (1974) and Grizzly (1976) which were highly derivative of the 1970s blockbuster hits The Exorcist and Jaws, respectively. Biography Montoro formed Film Ventures International (FVI), a small-scale independent movie production and distribution company, in 1968 in Atlanta, Georgia. His first effort was the softcore comedy Getting into Heaven starring Uschi Digard, which he wrote, produced and directed with a budget of $13,000. The film grossed almost 20 times its cost. Montoro expanded FVI and began churning out successful B-movies, among them acquisitions of foreign films from Italy including the spaghetti western Boot Hill in 1969. Grizzly was one of the first films Montoro financed and distributed himself. Produced on a $750,000 budget, the animal horror thriller became the most successful independent motion picture of 1976, earning more than $39 million worldwide. Montoro followed this success producing and releasing such films as Day of the Animals (1977) starring Christopher George and Leslie Nielsen; The Dark (1979) starring William Devane; The Visitor (1979) starring Glenn Ford; Kill and Kill Again (1981); Pieces (1982); The Pod People (1983); Mortuary (1983), starring Bill Paxton; Vigilante (1983) starring Robert Forster; and Mutant (1984) starring Bo Hopkins. In 1980, after acquiring the Italian film Great White, another film regarded as a Jaws rip-off, Montoro was sued by Universal Pictures because it was too derivative of the Steven Spielberg-directed hit. Great White had a large advertising budget of $4 million and achieved commercial success during its first week at the theaters. Nevertheless, Universal Pictures won the lawsuit and the film was immediately pulled from theatrical release. Disappearance In 1984, Film Ventures International was on the verge of collapse due to financial issues including the release failure of Great White, the poor box office performance of Montoro's final film Mutant and his pending divorce settlement. Montoro eventually embezzled over one million dollars from the FVI bank accounts and vanished, never to be seen again. Film Ventures International officially closed its doors in 1985. To this day, Montoro's whereabouts remain unknown, though it is believed he fled to Mexico in early 1987 under a false name. It is not even known if he is still alive. His unusual disappearance and the collapse of his company, FVI, have further contributed to Montoro's notorious legacy.

Contents The Magic Item Compendium contains over a thousand magic items used in Dungeons & Dragons. The book contains new items as well as items previously appearing in 3rd edition books, including the Arms and Equipment Guide, Magic of Faer√ªn, and Complete Divine, updated as necessary for version 3.5. The book classifies the items according to four broad categories: Armor (chapter one), Weapons (chapter two), Clothing (chapter three), and Tools (chapter four). Clothing refers to any non-armor item that occupies an equipment slot, including magical rings. Tools, including potions, scrolls, staves, and wands, are magical items that do not take up an equipment slot. Chapter five details item sets, which are collections of items of the four major types that individually have magical powers but will exhibit stronger effects as more items in the set are collected by a player character. Chapter six covers the use of magic items as well as their placement and creation. This chapter sets out specific rules on the use and creation of all magical items. Two appendices are included: one is a list of all the items in the Compendium and the Dungeon Masters Guide by price, and the other is a set of new randomized treasure tables. Each individual item description details the item's price and item level, the equipment slot the item occupies, the caster level required to craft the item, the school of magic the item's effect falls under, the actual effect of the item, the type of player action used to activate the item, the item's weight, and any prerequisites and costs associated with the item's creation or use. A physical description of each item is also included. New material Runestaffs are special staffs that allow a spellcaster to substitute an uncast spell slot of the appropriate level for a spell on their spell list in the staff. This can be done up to three times per day per spell, depending on the staff. Spontaneous casters can use runestaffs to expand their known spells, while casters who prepare spells can access their more esoteric spells (which they can substitute for more generic spells in their runestaffs). Augment Crystals are small trinkets that are attached to a suit of armor, shield or weapon (depending on the crystal). In effect, weapons, armor and shields have an additional \\"item slot\\" of their own to allow players to customize their weapons for situational benefits without drastically adding to the cost of the item. A revised magic item upgrade system is included, which separates miscellaneous powers (such as continuous and charge or per-day spell effects) from standard bonuses. These bonuses are now quickly added to any appropriate item without the \\"additional powers\\" multiplier. This has a number of benefits: first of all, players typically get magic items at a rather low level and then upgrade them with ability bonuses. Any item looted during later levels, even one that is highly desirable, is often discarded because it would be too expensive to reproduce the level-appropriate bonuses on their existing item. Second, it allows players to invest in interesting non-bonus items without losing the bonuses that CR-appropriate encounters assume the players have. Thirdly, it allows the magic items listed to have more variety and be available at lower levels; dungeon masters can apply upgrade costs quickly to allow an item to appear in higher-level treasure hoards. Finally, the Magic Item Compendium offers an optional gear-selection system that is vastly simplified while remaining compatible with the existing system. This simplified system makes it easy for Dungeon Masters to quickly design non- player characters with level-appropriate gear and equipment, without the arithmetic required in D&D; third edition. Publication history The Magic Item Compendium was written by Andy Collins with Eytan Bernstein, Frank Brunner, Owen K.C. Stephens, and John Snead. It was released March 2007. Cover art was by Francis Tsai, with interior art by Steven Belledin, Ed Cox, Carl Critchlow, Eric Deschamps, Steve Ellis, Wayne England, Matt Faulkner, Emily Fiegenschuh, Randy Gallegos, David Griffith, Brian Hagan, Ralph Horsley, Heather Hudson, Doug Kovacs, Chuck Lukacs, David Martin, Mark Poole, Steve Prescott, Wayne Reynolds, Ron Spencer, Anne Stokes, Arnie Swekel, Steven Tappin, Joel Thomas, Beth Trott, Franz Vohwinkel, Eva Widermann, and James Zhang. Collins, as the lead designer on the project, \\"started this process by identifying the 'big six' magic items that took up the majority of characters' item slots: magic weapons; magic armor & shields; rings of protection; cloaks of resistance; amulets of natural armor; and ability-score boosters\\". He \\"identified the reasons that these [magic] items were particularly well-loved: they were cost effective, they could be improved, there was nothing else as good in their slots, they were simple, they didn't take time to activate [and] they provided effects that were required for characters to stay competitive\\". With this in mind, the designers then pulled items from all the 3rd and 3.5 edition books and \\"after looking through about 2000 magic items, they looted the best 1000 or so\\". The Magic Item Compendium also showed some early hallmarks of 4th edition design: items were marked levels and some items appeared at multiple strengths. It also introduced the idea of item sets, where items of a set would improve as more were collected, which would then reappear in the fourth-edition book Adventurer's Vault 2 (2009). The Magic Item Compendium was reproduced as a premium reprint, featuring a new cover and including errata, on July 16, 2013. Reception The reviewer from Pyramid commented that: \\"If you are the type of gamer who likes to trick-out your character with the best equipment, or the type of GM who likes to give your players lots of quests items and reward the PC's efforts with goodies and gear then you will likely find this book both interesting and useful. The designers of this book have pulled together a vast number of items and introduced new rules to make implementing magic items more systematic, and made it perhaps more fun for players who may have learned their first fantasy gaming from computer rather than table-top experiences.\\" Tim Janson from mania.com wrote: \\"It felt like the good, old days again just browsing through page after page of this treasure trove. The art is fantastic as usual. One of the best Supplements to come out in a long time.\\" DieHard GameFan said that \\"what I took away from the Magic Item Compendium is that it is for gamers that want to roll-play instead of role-play. It's for munchkin min/maxing gamers who would rather spend more time looking up precisely how and what to roll (and when) rather than trying to tell a fun story with friends. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's not the type of gaming *I* enjoy, so I can't think of when I would ever need to use the Magic Item Compendium, and more importantly, when I would ever want to.\\" References =Sources= * Category:2007 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Magic Item Compendium"},{"id":"10491411","text":"John Felix Rowser (born April 24, 1944) was an American football player, a defensive back in the National Football League for ten seasons with the Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Denver Broncos.

This medium is important in medical laboratories as one method of distinguishing pathogenic microbes in a short period of time. It contains a high concentration (about 7.5‚Äì10%) of salt (NaCl), making it selective for most Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Micrococcaceae) since this level of salt is inhibitory to most other bacteria. It is also a differential medium for mannitol-fermenting staphylococci, containing carbohydrate mannitol and the indicator phenol red, a pH indicator for detecting acid produced by mannitol-fermenting staphylococci. Staphylococcus aureus produces yellow colonies with yellow zones, whereas other coagulase-negative staphylococci produce small pink or red colonies with no colour change to the medium. If an organism can ferment mannitol, an acidic byproduct is formed that causes the phenol red in the agar to turn yellow.

John Calvin's view of Scripture includes the ideas that Scripture is necessary for human understanding of God's revelation, that it is the equivalent of direct revelation, and that it is both \\"majestic\\" and \\"simple.\\" Calvin's general, explicit exposition of his view of Scripture is found mainly in his Institutes of the Christian Religion.  Authentic Geneva Bible from 1578. Translation of the Bible used by many Protestant Reformers Leaf of a1578 Geneva Pulpit Bible. Necessity Calvin viewed Scripture as necessary in two ways. First, he held that general revelation cannot in itself give humanity a saving knowledge of God. Although he can be known in some ways through creation he has \\"added the light of his Word in order that he might make himself known unto salvation.\\"Institutes I.vi.1. Calvin compares Scripture to being like a pair of spectacles, that enable us to properly interpret what we see in creation: > For as the aged, or those whose sight is defective, when any book, however > fair, is set before them, though they perceive that there is something > written, are scarcely able to make out two consecutive words, but, when > aided by glasses, begin to read distinctly, so Scripture, gathering together > the impressions of Deity, which, till then, lay confused in our minds, > dissipates the darkness, and shows us the true God clearly. Second, Calvin held that inscripturation is necessary to avoid the errors inherent in oral transmission:Murray, John. \\"Calvin's Doctrine of Scripture,\\" in Collected Writings, Vol IV, p. 162. > For if we reflect how prone the human mind is to lapse into forgetfulness of > God, how readily inclined to every kind of error, how bent every now and > then on devising new and fictitious religions, it will be easy to understand > how necessary it was to make such a depository of doctrine as would secure > it from either perishing by the neglect, vanishing away amid the errors, or > being corrupted by the presumptuous audacity of men.Institutes I.vi.3. Authority Calvin viewed Scripture as being equivalent to an utterance of God given from heaven: > Since no daily responses are given from heaven, and the Scriptures are the > only records in which God has been pleased to consign his truth to perpetual > remembrance, the full authority which they ought to possess with the > faithful is not recognised, unless they are believed to have come from > heaven, as directly as if God had been heard giving utterance to > them.Institutes I.vii.1. According to Calvin, Word and Spirit must always go together. Scripture gives us a saving knowledge of God, but only when its certainty is \\"founded on the inward persuasion of the Holy Spirit.\\"Institutes I.viii.13. It is \\"foolish to attempt to prove to infidels that the Scripture is the Word of God,\\" since this can only be known by faith. Nevertheless, he did see a place for evidences of Scripture's authority, as long it is recognised that they are secondary: > The human testimonies which go to confirm it will not be without effect, if > they are used in subordination to that chief and highest proof, as secondary > helps to our weakness. The \\"chief and highest proof\\" being, of course, the testimony of the Holy Spirit, though Calvin does not say that the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit is the source of this authority. John Murray has suggested that the distinction between the authority intrinsic to Scripture, and our persuasion that it is authoritative is not \\"as clearly formulated in Calvin as we might desire.\\"Murray, John. Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1978), 44. Character Calvin viewed Scripture as being both majestic and simple. According to Ford Lewis Battles, Calvin had discovered that \\"sublimity of style and sublimity of thought were not coterminous.\\"Battles, Ford Lewis. \\"God Was Accommodating Himself to Human Capacity,\\" in Donald McKim (ed.) Readings in Calvin's Theology (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1984), 38. =Majesty= Calvin believed that Scripture possesses \\"a divine majesty which will subdue our presumptuous opposition, and force us to do it homage.\\"Institutes I.vii.4. It speaks with a unified voice, and its parts make up a perfect harmony: > How admirably the system of divine wisdom contained in it is arranged‚Äîhow > perfectly free the doctrine is from every thing that savours of earth‚Äîhow > beautifully it harmonises in all its parts‚Äîand how rich it is in all the > other qualities which give an air of majesty to composition.Institutes > I.viii.1 . =Simplicity= Scripture, according to Calvin, also has an \\"unpolished simplicity\\". It is not particularly eloquent, for that would detract from its message: > The sublime mysteries of the kingdom of heaven have for the greater part > been delivered with a contemptible meanness of words. Had they been adorned > with a more splendid eloquence, the wicked might have cavilled, and alleged > that this constituted all their force. But now, when an unpolished > simplicity, almost bordering on rudeness, makes a deeper impression than the > loftiest flights of oratory, what does it indicate if not that the Holy > Scriptures are too mighty in the power of truth to need the rhetorician‚Äôs > art?

He was the son of chemist Anton Schr√∂tter von Kristelli, and father to physician Hermann Schroetter- Kristelli (1870‚Äì1928). Leopold Schr√∂tter Ritter von Kristelli studied at the Akademisches Gymnasium in Graz, Austria. In 1861 he received his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna, and following graduation remained in Vienna as an apprentice-surgeon to Franz Schuh (1804‚Äì1865). From 1863 to 1869, he was an assistant to Josef ≈†koda (1805‚Äì1881), receiving his habilitation in 1867. Following the death of Ludwig T√ºrck (1810‚Äì1868), he attained the first chair of laryngology at Vienna, and three years later, became director of the world's first laryngological clinic at Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus). In 1875, he became an associate professor of laryngology, and from 1875 to 1881, he was head of the department of internal medicine. In 1881 he was appointed Primararzt (primary physician) at the General Hospital, and in 1890 was named professor and director of the third medical clinic in Vienna. In addition to his expertise in the field of laryngology, Schr√∂tter is remembered for his work involving diseases of the heart and lungs. He was a driving force in construction of the Alland Lungenheilanstalt (lung clinic), an institution that began attending to patients in 1898. With British surgeon James Paget (1814‚Äì1899), the eponymous Paget-Schr√∂tter disease is named. This disorder involves primary thrombosis of the axillary vein or subclavian vein.  Selected publications  Among his written works is a treatise on heart diseases that was included in Hugo Wilhelm von Ziemssen's Handbuch der speciellen Pathologie und Therapie. Other noted works by Schr√∂tter include: * Beitrag zur Behandlung der Larynx-Stenosen (Contribution to the treatment of laryngeal stenosis), 1876. * Beitrag zur localen Anaesthesie des Larynx (On local anesthesia of the larynx), 1881. * √úber die Lungentuberkulose und die Mittel zu ihrer Heilung (About pulmonary tuberculosis and the means to cure), 1891. * Hygiene der Lunge im gesunden und kranken Zustand (Hygiene of the lung in healthy and diseased states), 1903. * √úber Hotelbau vom hygienischen Standpunkte (On hotel construction from a hygienic standpoint), 1906.

Sa Dragonera () is an uninhabited islet in the Balearic Islands, Spain, located just off the west coast of Majorca. It is currently a natural park.P√†gina del Consell de Mallorca - Sa Dragonera Geography Geologically speaking, Dragonera is an emerged part of the geologic system running southwest-northeast in the Iberian Peninsula. This runs from the M√°laga province through Cap de la Nau and then gets submerged under the Mediterranean Sea. It surfaces again to form the island of Ibiza, the Tramuntana Range in the island of Majorca and Sa Dragonera itself. The silhouette of the mountain range vaguely resembles a dragon, hence its name.Sa Dragonera Natural Park Sa Dragonera is approximately 3,200 metres in length and has a maximum width of 500 metres. Although its highest hill Pico Popi is only 360 metres high, the island's overall relief is very abrupt, especially considering its small size, which made the islet of little importance in historic times. The island is a part of the municipality of Andratx, which is, along with Sant Elm (both in nearby Majorca), the closest towns to the island. Dragonera has a small natural port in the Cala Llad√≥ area. History The name of Dragonera comes from Dragon that was associated to the shape that the island has from a specific perspective, and from the large number of endemic Lilford's wall lizards. There is an Ancient Roman necropolis in the Es Llad√≥ area, but there are no other signs of historical permanent settling. During the 18th century two defensive watchtowers were built on the island in order to watch for the numerous Barbary pirates operating in the area. In 1910 the lighthouses of Tramuntana (north) and Llebeig (southwest) began to operate, replacing the Faro Viejo or old lighthouse, which was built in a lower part of the island, in an area often surrounded by mist. In 1941 Juan Flexas bought the islet and started farming activities in the Es Llad√≥ area. By the mid 20th century, the islet was often used by estraperlo smugglers for their illegal activities. Between 1960 and 1975 the lighthouses were improved and became automatic, which meant that the only permanent and tiny population (that of the lighthouse keeper and family) left the islet. In 1974 the islet was bought by a Spanish company in order to build a touristic resort. The original plan included a luxury residential, an hotel, a casino and, to serve all these, a manmade port. These plans were heavily contested by the ecologist movements and a harsh and long legal battle followed. The ecologists managed to get all the plans on hold until the legal controversy was cleared. It only finished ten years after, in 1984, when the Audiencia Nacional finally barred any building activities on the uninhabited islet. Part of the 1982 film adapting Agatha Christie's mystery Evil Under the Sun was shot in Sa Dragonera, presented as an island of the fictional Tyrania by the Adriatic. Then, in 1987, the Consell Insular de Mallorca bought the islet. In 1995 the Balearic regional Government declared the islet natural park status along with the nearby islets of Pantaleu and Isla Mediana.

She received Helen after the latter had been driven out of Sparta by Megapenthes and Nicostratus (Menelaus, Helen's husband, was already dead by the time). Still, Polyxo blamed Helen for Tlepolemus' death and decided to take revenge on her. So when Helen was bathing, several handmaidens in the guise of the Erinyes, sent by Polyxo, seized her and hanged her from a tree.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 3. 19. 9 - 10 In an alternate version, Menelaus and Helen landed at Rhodes on their way back from Egypt, whereupon Polyxo sent a crowd of armed islanders of both genders against them, hoping to avenge her husband's death on Helen. Menelaus hid Helen away under the deck and had a beautiful servant dressed up as the queen, which resulted in her, and not the real Helen, being killed.Polyaenus, Stratagems of War, 1. 13 Yet another source, which uses the name \\"Philozoe\\" rather than \\"Polyxo\\", informs that she held funeral games of Tlepolemus; youths competed in them, and the winners were crowned with white poplar leaves.Tzetzes on Lycophron, 911Tzetzes on Lycophron, Alexandra 911 *Polyxo, a Maenad in the retinue of Dionysus who attempted to kill Lycurgus of Thrace.Nonnus, Dionysiaca, 21. 69 *Polyxo (or Polyzo), a sister of Meleager.Scholia on Homer, Iliad, 9. 584 References Category:Naiads Category:Queens in Greek mythology Category:Children of Nilus Category:Women in Greek mythology Category:Characters in Greek mythology ","title":"Polyxo"},{"id":"10491750","text":"The 1963 Davis Cup was the 52nd edition of the Davis Cup, the most important tournament between national teams in men's tennis. 32 teams entered the Europe Zone, 9 teams entered the Eastern Zone, and 7 teams entered the America Zone.

Named for counties in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, and West Virginia, she was the only U.S. Naval vessel to bear the name. LST-389 was laid down on 20 June 1942 at Newport News, Virginia by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company; launched on 28 September 1942; sponsored by Miss Clara Elizabeth Ashe; and commissioned on 24 November 1942 with Lieutenant George C. Carpenter, USNR, in command. Service history =Mediterranean, 1942-1944= After shakedown training in the Chesapeake Bay, during which she also served as training ship for crews to be assigned to other tank landing ships, LST-389 departed Norfolk on 19 February 1943, bound for Bayonne, New Jersey where she took on board one tank landing craft (LCT), United States Army troops, and a cargo of medical supplies. Sailing with convoy UGS 6A on 19 March, she proceeded via Bermuda to North Africa and reached Nemours, Algeria on 13 April. Soon shifting to the Arzew Naval Base, Algeria the ship became the flagship for Captain Frank Adams, Commander, LST Group 5, Flotilla 2. LST-389 was soon involved in the campaign to invade Sicily, a steppingstone to Italy. Sicily At 0905 on 8 July 1943 she beached at Scoglitti, Sicily and unloaded part of her cargo before retracting at 1030. The ship next beached at Bracette Point, Sicily at 1850, and disembarked troops and unloaded mobile equipment before she pulled free of the beach at 1958 to anchor off Cape Scalambri. At 2200 that evening, she witnessed numerous flares, bomb bursts, and artillery fire over the beach, two or three miles (5 km) away, indicating that fierce fighting was still in progress on shore. At 1000 the following morning, the tank landing ship got underway and soon thereafter, beached south of Bracette Point, where she then discharged her tanks and vehicles. That day, LST-389 suffered damage in a collision when could not change course in time to clear her while retracting. The two ships scraped each other and LST-5's anchor ripped a large hole in LST-389's starboard side. Over the next few days, enemy air power did its best to thwart the landings. Almost continuous air attacks harried the ships offshore on the evening of 9 July. On the 12th, she spent most of the day loading ammunition. On the 13th, she beached at Beach Red 1 and spent much of the day there, unloading the remainder of her cargo. At 2150 that day, an enemy plane dropped four bombs nearby. The closest landed on her starboard beam about away, but it caused no damage. Underway for Bizerte on 16 July, LST-389 arrived there two days later for 10 days of repairs. She then sailed for Licata, Sicily and from that port made three trips to Palermo to lift Army troops and vehicles. Late in August, LST-389 was fitted with a pontoon causeway section to be used during the invasion of the Italian mainland. She got underway on 1 September and soon joined a convoy for Italy. On the night of 8 September, on her way to the landing beaches, LST-389 observed two twin- engine German bombers attack accompanying minesweepers, narrowly missing them. For the balance of the night, frequent air raids prompted equally frequent orders to general quarters, but the tank landing ship survived many near misses without a scratch. Salerno On 9 September, Vice Admiral H. Kent Hewitt's Western Naval Task Force began landing Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's Allied 5th Army on the shores of the Gulf of Salerno. At 0855, LST-389 received orders to proceed to beach \\"Blue\\" near Agripoli. After minesweepers had cleared a path, exploding three mines in the process, LST-389 started in. As the ship moved shoreward, shells exploded in the water and on the beach from enemy guns, which earlier that morning had driven off six tank-laden LCT's. The ship ground onto the strand at 1241, but soon received orders to move to the more tenable \\"Red\\" beach. Heavy German artillery and machine gun fire continued to pound and sweep \\"Blue\\" beach so severely that it was dubbed one of the two invasion points \\"most difficult for the invaders to negotiate.\\" Under heavy fire, LST 389 attempted to comply with the orders but could not. Stuck fast to \\"Blue\\" beach, the gallant tank landing ship then proceeded to carry out her original orders. Her crew deployed the pontoon unit; and, a little over an hour later at 1354, the first tank roared out of the ship's gaping bow doors. By the time she finally managed to clear the beach at 1509, LST-389 had endured much at the hands of German gunners. Some 60 shells had been fired at the ship. At 1313, a shell demolished the captain's cabin while wounding a number of men. Fire sweeping the exposed bridge prompted its abandonment, but two volunteers remained to maintain uninterrupted telephone contact with all stations on board. The crew of her lone gun claimed to have silenced two or three of the deadly German 88-millimeter guns. Even after leaving \\"Blue\\" beach, LST 389 came under attack, this time from enemy bombers. Eighteen bombs fell close by that night, but caused no damage to the ship. The next night, heavy air attacks upon the ships commenced at 2220. Less than 20 minutes later, four bombs fell close aboard LST-389, and, over the next half hour, nine more exploded nearby. Meanwhile, the ship's 20-millimeter batteries kept the intruders under constant fire and scored a \\"few\\" hits. On the other hand, a 20-millimeter shell (probably from an adjacent ship) exploded on the main deck just forward of the wheelhouse, wounding two LST 389 crewmen. The next morning, 11 September, seven more bombs burst close aboard, again jostling the ship. At about 0930, a glider bomb disabled the nearby light cruiser . Finally departing Salerno on 11 September, LST-389 sailed to Milazzo, Sicily to await orders which came soon and took her back to Salerno with elements of the famed British 8th Army embarked. During the remainder of September, LST-389 made four more such trips followed by several runs carrying troops and supplies between Tripoli and Salerno. Released from this duty on 2 October, the ship proceeded to Oran, Algeria for repairs to the damage she had received at Salerno. =Invasion of France, 1944-1945= Clearing Oran on 12 November LST-389 sailed for England in MKS-30, a convoy which endured a glider-bomb attack, launched by German Dornier bombers, without suffering any losses. Shortly before Thanksgiving the ship, now a veteran of two major amphibious landings, arrived at Plymouth and waited for orders. Following a period in drydock there for minor repairs beginning on 13 December, LST-389 departed Plymouth on 20 December and reached Falmouth the same day. On Christmas Eve, she started preparing for the invasion of France. \\"With the beginning of 1944...\\" wrote the ship's historian, \\"...the ship moved from place to place, beaching, retracting, learning the new methods of war.\\" Finally ending up in the Welsh port of Milford Haven, LST-389 stayed there for the rest of January and all of February before shifting to Swansea, Wales for more training. After operating there until 27 April, LST-389 proceeded to Lisahally on the shore of Lough Foyle in Northern Ireland to receive six 40-millimeter and six 20-millimeter guns. Following more repairs and alterations at Milford Haven, LST-389 spent the rest of May training for the assault on Hitler's \\"Atlantic Wall.\\" Loading Army vehicles and embarking troops at Falmouth on 2 June 1944 she got underway on 4 June and proceeded to the task force anchorage where the ship lay until setting out for France on the following morning. After anchoring in Baie de la Seine at 0927 on 7 June, she began resupply operations for the Normandy beachhead that afternoon. One of her LCVP coxswains suffered wounds at 1645 when his craft was hit on its way to the beach. The next morning, German planes braved heavy antiaircraft fire to attack the shipping off the invasion beaches. Four bombs landed in the sea near LST-389 causing \\"minor hull vibrations.\\" The tank landing ship unloaded her embarked vehicles that afternoon, 8 June, and survived another nocturnal bombing attack at 0034 on the 9th before getting underway for Southampton later that morning. For the rest of June, LST-389 shuttled supplies and men between Southampton and various beaches along the northern coast of France. Her cargoes included food, medical supplies, and vehicles. After the port's capture by the Allies in July, she added Cherbourg to her itinerary and, railroad tracks having been installed in her tank deck, began carrying rolling stock in early September. In the course of these train- ferrying operations, LST-389 struck an underwater obstruction at Grand Rade, Cherbourg, on 12 November. Major leaks in her main engine room resulted. Unable to make any headway against the rising water, the tank landing ship, aided by two tugboats, was beached. Seven hours of shoring, patching, and pumping freed the engine room of unwanted water. With the aid of British tugs, LST-389 then completed her ferry mission before LST-355 towed her back to Devonport, England. Following major repairs in drydock, the ship received an overhaul alongside before resuming active service in mid-January 1945. She again shuttled railroad cars and passengers between England and France. While returning from Le Havre to Portland, Dorset, early on the fog-shrouded morning of 5 February, LST-389 was rammed by the civilian merchantman SS Chapel Hill Victory. The collision ripped a hole wide in the tank landing ship from main deck to bottom and killed one member of her crew. LST-389 then proceeded to Portland under her own power. After a week at anchor off Portland, LST-389 put into Plymouth for another drydocking which lasted into late March. LST-389 next made one trip carrying vehicles to Cherbourg and two more to Le Havre before she had LCT skids installed on her main deck at Falmouth. =Return to the US, 1945= Picking up and a \\"general cargo\\" at Plymouth, LST-389 put into Belfast, Northern Ireland on 8 May, the day after Germany surrendered. On the 11th, she sailed in a convoy bound for the United States and reached Norfolk on the last day of the month. Following overhaul at New York, the ship proceeded to Little Creek, Virginia on 5 September 1945. Since the war in the Pacific had ceased in mid-August, LST-389's orders to proceed to that area of the world were cancelled. Instead, she returned to New York to pick up another LCT and then sailed for Jacksonville, Florida. =Decommissioning and transfer, 1945-1960= She arrived at the Inactive Fleet Berthing Area at Green Cove Springs, Florida on 9 October 1945 and reported for duty with the Inactive Fleet. Decommissioned on 12 March 1946 she was placed in reserve on 1 July 1946. LST-389 remained in reserve, first at Green Cove Springs and later at Charleston, Mayport, and again in Green Cove Springs, through the 1950s. While inactive, she was named USS Boone County (LST-389) on 1 July 1955. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1959. LST-389 received three battle stars for her World War II service. Greek service She was transferred to Greece in May, 1960 and was renamed Lesvos with a pennant of L172. During her service with the Hellenic Navy, she was involved in combat action in Cyprus on July 20, 1974 (CO Lt Cdr E. Handrinos, HN). On that day, she was in the Paphos area on a scheduled mission, carrying replacement personnel to the permanent Greek military force based in Cyprus (ELDYK). As the Turkish invasion of Cyprus had started a few hours earlier, she shelled the Turkish Cypriot garrison of Paphos with her 40 mm guns, forcing them to surrender.

The record was released as the second single from the album via Columbia Records label. Overview It is the only song on the album that was co-written by producer Chris Tsangarides who wrote the song's guitar riff, while the rest of the song was written by the main songwriting team of Rob Halford, K. K. Downing, and Glenn Tipton. Tsangarides would team up again with Tipton for songwriting eleven years later, for Judas Priest's album Demolition, released in 2001, on which the two of them wrote the songs \\"Subterfuge\\" and \\"Metal Messiah\\". It is one of the few songs on the album on which the synthesizers (which had originally been featured on several songs, but had been removed from some) remained part of the song. These synthesizers were played by rock veteran keyboardist Don Airey. Between the slow drums and the eerie keyboards, the song was given a chilling sound, making it a sort of pseudo-ballad. However, when played live, the keyboard intro is replaced by a guitar riff. The song's lyrics deal with demonic possession, black magic, and temptation to commit acts of evil. However, according to Halford himself, as cited in Metal Hammer in January 2004, the lyrics deal with a love-related theme, although metaphorically. The song features a classically-inspired guitar solo by Glenn Tipton. Personnel * Rob Halford ‚Äì vocals * Glenn Tipton ‚Äì lead guitar * K. K.

Li Shimin, the second son of Emperor Gaozu, was in an intense rivalry with his elder brother Li Jiancheng and younger brother Li Yuanji. He took control and set up an ambush at Xuanwu Gate, the northern gate leading to the Palace City of the imperial capital Chang'an. There, Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were murdered by Li Shimin and his men. Within three days after the coup, Li Shimin was installed as the crown prince. Emperor Gaozu abdicated another sixty days later and passed the throne to Li Shimin, who would become known as Emperor Taizong. Background After the founding of the Tang dynasty by Emperor Gaozu, the emperor's eldest son Li Jiancheng was established as the heir apparent, but he was often overshadowed by his younger brother Li Shimin.. For instance, Li Shimin was instrumental in defeating several of Tang's major rivals.. He had led the attack on Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong, whom he defeated in battle, which gained him prestige among his contemporaries. Meanwhile, Li Jiancheng was stationed along the northern frontier to guard it against the Tujue, which left him unable to build up a similar reputation.. Eventually, Emperor Gaozu elevated Li Shimin's position above all other nobles. He also placed Li Shimin in charge of the civil and military administration of the eastern plain, with Luoyang as its headquarters. There, Li Shimin established himself and appointed about fifty civil and military officials, which made it possible for him to challenge the heir apparent's pre-eminence.. In 621, he established the College of Literary Studies with a staff of eighteen scholars to serve as his advisors on state affairs. This may have insinuated in Li Jiancheng's mind that Li Shimin could harbor ambition to ascend to the throne himself. Henceforth, Li Jiancheng attempted to undermine Li Shimin by getting his staff members removed and reassigned to other posts. Prince Li Shimin found himself unable to gain support in the capital Chang'an or inside the imperial palaces, as he was often away on military expeditions. He mostly relied on Luoyang where he could successfully build strong support among military and civil officials. Meanwhile, in Chang'an, Crown Prince Li Jiancheng was increasing his power by recruiting more than two thousand men to serve in the Changlin troops, which he stationed at the East Palace near the Changlin Gate. He was also allied with his second younger brother Prince Li Yuanji. They had the support of Emperor Gaozu's consorts, who often interceded with court affairs on behalf of the two princes. There were allegations that Yang Wengan () was raising troops for Li Jiancheng‚Äîwho was left in charge of the capital while Emperor Gaozu was away in his summer palace‚Äîto stage a coup for the throne. Whether Li Jiancheng was actually involved is still disputed among historians. Yang Wengan was the regional commander of Qingzhou in Gansu and a former guard of Li Jiancheng at the East Palace. The plot was disclosed to the authorities, so Li Jiancheng was summoned from Chang'an and Yang Wengan was summoned from his garrison post. Li Jiancheng went to seek forgiveness against the advice of a subordinate to seize the throne. In contrast, Yang Wengan raised his troops and rebelled in the 6th month of 624.. Emperor Gaozu sent Li Shimin to put down the rebellion, but Yang's own subordinates killed him after the imperial forces arrived at the scene.. Emperor Gaozu initially offered Li Shimin the position of heir apparent in light of Yang's rebellion. However, Li Jiancheng's supporters, Li Yuanji, the palace ladies, and Minister Feng Deyi interceded to clear Li Jiancheng from the affair. Thus, Emperor Gaozu allowed Li Jiancheng to remain the heir apparent, but exiled some of Li Jiancheng's advisors and at least one member of Li Shimin's staff. Some canonical texts have asserted that prior to the coup, Prince Li Shimin survived a poisoning attempt by his two brothers.. According to the Jiu Tangshu, it happened prior to 626, while the Zizhi Tongjian dates it to the 6th lunar month of 626, placing it within three days of the coup. states that the latter interpretation is most probably the one to be incorrect, since the poisoning had rendered Li Shimin seriously ill. It is still disputed when or whether this poisoning actually happened. Crown Prince Li Jiancheng and Prince Li Yuanji successfully plotted the dismissal of Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui, Li Shimin's principal advisors, from service. Li Shimin's general Yuchi Jingde escaped an assassination attempt ordered by the two princes, but he was later slandered by the two princes at court and came near execution if it had not been for Li Shimin's intercession. By 626, Li Shimin became increasingly worried by his brothers' successful machinations in turning Emperor Gaozu against him and in removing his staff members. Events leading to the incident Early 626, the Tujue attacked the frontier of the Tang empire. At Li Jiancheng's recommendation, Li Yuanji was commissioned for a military campaign against these hostile forces, thus Li Shimin's best generals and crack troops were transferred to Li Yuanji.. Thereafter, Li Shimin received word from his men that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had taken preparations to assassinate him when he would see off Li Yuanji as was the custom during the onset of a military campaign.. Li Shimin decided to take action and planned to dispose of his two brothers at the advice of his subordinates, especially Zhangsun Wuji, Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, Yuchi Jingde, and Hou Junji.. Li Shimin sent Zhangsun to recall his two most important advisors Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui to help plan the course of action.. After being summoned in secrecy, Fang and Du disguised themselves as Taoist priests and traveled to Li Shimin's camp to discuss the strategy. Li Shimin also bribed Chang He (), who at the time was the military commander guarding the Xuanwu Gate, into following his orders. Few years prior, Chang had been an officer under Li Shimin, but he was eventually reassigned to a key position at the Xuanwu Gate in 624. Eventually, Li Shimin submitted a message to his father, Emperor Gaozu, accusing Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji of having illicit affairs with several consorts of the emperor. After receiving the message, Emperor Gaozu summoned Li Shimin to come for an audience the following morning. The emperor also requested for his personal advisors Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, and Yan Shigu to come. However, Consort Zhang () learned of Li Shimin's accusations and informed Li Jiancheng.. Li Jiancheng summoned Li Yuanji to deliberate together on how to deal with the difficult situation.. Li Yuanji opted to not attend the imperial court that morning, but to excuse themselves due to \\"illness\\" and prepare the troops, so they could observe the situation.. However, Li Jiancheng said that the troops were already prepared and wanted to leave for the Palace City to hear first-hand what was amiss. While Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji left at dawn to consult Emperor Gaozu personally, Li Shimin and his followers had taken control over Xuanwu Gate. Coup d'√©tat On the dawn of 2 July 626, Prince Li Shimin and his followers arrived at the Xuanwu Gate, where they awaited the arrival of Crown Prince Li Jiancheng and Prince Li Yuanji.. Chang He, a military officer stationed at Xuanwu Gate, also led his troops in support of Li Shimin on the day of the coup. As Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached the Linhu Hall, they began to realize that a coup was about to unfold and immediately retreated eastward.. Li Shimin rode towards his brothers and hailed them. Hereupon, Li Yuanji attempted to draw his bow to fire his arrows at Li Shimin, but he did not manage to draw it. Li Shimin started to fire his arrows at Li Jiancheng and killed him. Yuchi Jingde and 70 horsemen caught up with Li Yuanji and shot at him, causing Li Yuanji to fall from his horse. However, Li Shimin's horse fled into the woods and became entangled with tree branches, which led to Li Shimin falling off his horse too and being unable to get up. Li Yuanji quickly grabbed Li Shimin's bow and tried to strangle his brother with it. However, Yuchi Jingde arrived and shouted at him, so Li Yuanji fled on foot to Wude Hall. Nevertheless, Yuchi Jingde overtook Li Yuanji and killed him with his arrows. Following the deaths of Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, while Li Shimin's forces held Xuanwu Gate under their control, fighting broke out between the two armed factions. When Yuchi Jingde arrived with the heads of the two princes, their retainers quickly dispersed with their troops. During the morning of the coup, as stated by , Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji probably left from the East Palace through its northern gate and traveled westwards through the Forbidden Park towards the Xuanwu Gate, while Li Shimin probably left from the Hongyi Palace and traveled through the Forbidden Park towards the Xuanwu Gate.. Aftermath Emperor Gaozu was sailing on a lake inside the Palace City during the time of the coup. speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the impending crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of the unfolding events and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, according to the Jiu Tangshu and Zizhi Tongjian, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde fully armed into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu... Emperor Gaozu asked who was disturbing the peace and why he came, whereupon Yuchi Jingde replied that the Prince of Qin had taken arms to execute the heir apparent, the Prince of Qi, who was disturbing the peace and, apprehensive that his majesty would be alarmed, sent him to stand guard.. The sources agree that Emperor Gaozu was satisfied by Yuchi Jingde's answer. The Zizhi Tongjian adds that Emperor Gaozu asked his officials what ought to be done as he had not anticipated the events. Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent. Even though Li Shimin had come out victorious, he still needed a positive appraisal for his conduct from the emperor to prevent further internal conflict. At Yuchi's advice, Emperor Gaozu issued an imperial edict ordering the remaining forces to stop their resistance and submit to Li Shimin. In the end, Li Shimin had taken full control over the Tang government. Within three days, Emperor Gaozu named Li Shimin the heir apparent. On the 9th day of the 8th month, he abdicated in favor for Li Shimin. He became a Taishang Huang (Retired Emperor) himself, only appearing in public sometimes to attend ceremonial functions at court. The reconstructed Danfeng Gate of the Daming Palace, a palatial complex built as a home for Emperor Taizong's father, the former Emperor Gaozu In 632, Ma Zhou charged that the retired Emperor Gaozu had settled in the Da'an Palace, which he considered an inhospitable place as it was built on low-lying lands at Chang'an that were plagued by dampness and heat during the summer. According to him, ever since Emperor Taizong moved to the countryside during the summers, his retired father was left behind in Chang'an to suffer in the summer heat. However, his father would always decline any invitation to spend the summer together when Emperor Taizong eventually did invite him. Ma Zhou also charged that Emperor Taizong had not visited his father for a long time even though they lived nearby each other. Ever since the bloody palace coup, it seemed that father and son had drifted apart to such an extent that their relationship never healed. In 634, Emperor Taizong launched the construction of the Daming Palace.. He ordered the construction of the new summer palace as a residence for his father,. but Emperor Gaozu grew ill and never witnessed the palace's completion before his death in the 5th month of 635.

He had been elected for the Portarlington constituency in the post-Union parliament at Westminster, but the creation of the peerage prevented him taking his seat and so he never sat in Westminster.Constituencies 1790-1820: Portarlington, History of Parliament Lord Ashtown married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Robinson, in 1785. They had no children. He died in May 1840, aged 84, and was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his nephew Frederick. Lady Ashtown died in 1844.

It was completed in 1883 with a breakwater only 427 metres (1,400 feet) long. The cost was HK$96,500. In December 1903 a legislative council member, Gershom Stewart, suggested that the typhoon shelter be expanded. The motion was passed but expansion works could not be carried out due to lack of capital. The Legislative Council and the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce questioned the Hong Kong Government on the expansion in 1904 and 1906, but the Government did not give any response.Chinese Mail, 2 November 1906 On 18 September 1906, a typhoon struck Hong Kong, destroying 3,653 boats and killing 15,000 people, most of them fishermen. In March 1908 the Government finally carried out expansion works on the typhoon shelter, deepening it by 3 metres (9 feet) and expanded it to 30 hectares (75 acres). In 1953 the typhoon shelter was moved northwards to its present site and the original typhoon shelter was reclaimed to provide land for Victoria Park.

It is published in French by Pika Editions, in German by Egmont Manga & Anime, in South Korea by Haksan Publishing, and in Italy by Flashbook Edizioni. Story In the near future, the Japanese National Police Agency covertly establishes an armed division called Minkei or Private Police in order to stem out rampant crimes that has firearms involved by heavily armed criminals and terrorists. Minkei's recruitment methods favour ability and as such are willing to take in anyone that displays the aptitude to handle the work. Zero In follows the Light Knight B squad of Kou, Mikuru, Kina (deceased), Fujita, Hana and Shikie their cases and interactions. The story mainly focuses on the two main protagonists Kou and Mikuru, with various chapters giving more in depth focus on their partners. Mikuru's relationships both within and without Minkei are a prime story focus as is the roller coaster ride of her developing relationship with Kou, the way she handles her life in the two differing worlds of a high school idol and a Minkei officer, and her very physical rivalry with the older Shikie. Kou receives considerable development, going from being the weak kid that's always bullied to a considerably popular and confident young man who still agonises over his crush of Mikuru and fear of rejection if he confesses, as well as trying to keep his professional life as a Minkei officer out of his personal life as a high school student. Main characters ;Kou Shiraishi Kou Shiraishi is an average 16-year-old high school student from a family of police officers. Because of feelings of inferiority with regards to his older brother, Gaku, his mild personality made him a prime target for the school bullies. He joins Minkei after the school idol Mikuru, who's also a part of the force, rescues him twice. The training he receives builds an inner core of confidence and his exceptional performance in assessing tactical situations gets him assigned as a Keeper. His general friendly personality endears him to many at Minkei, and even the usually brusque Misono develops a degree of fondness for the younger man. He also passively pursues his relationship with Mikuru alternately confused by her bouts of jealousy, to irritated by her secretive nature about her past. As of volume 12, they've shared their first kiss after Kou began to actively pursue her. ;Mikuru Nazume A 16-year-old high school girl. A product of childhood tragedy, Mikuru possesses several distinct personalities. The face of the school idol, friendly yet aloof. And her true personality of an angry and bitter young woman. The third, and seldom seen, killer personality which only rears its head under extreme emotional distress. Forced to kill her father, whom she adored, she became withdrawn and introverted. Trained from a young age to fight and shoot, she is adept user of the Zero In martial arts style, which she uses to incapacitate criminals. Unwilling to kill, she nonetheless is highly regarded and surprisingly well-liked within Minkei. Softened by Kou's attraction and friendship, she finds herself slowly drawn into a small circle of friends at school, which she finds herself beginning to enjoy, rather than it just being a cover. Less enjoyable, however, were the feelings of jealousy towards any woman that showed an interest in Kou whose newfound confidence was drawing attention. As of volume 12, Kou has made his intentions towards her clear and they share their first kiss. ;Gaku Shiraishi The eldest son of the Shiraishi family, and the youngest police commissioner at 28 years of age. He rarely ever shows his face at home, even avoiding the celebration of his father's thirty years on the police force. Kou deeply resents Gaku's aloofness referring to him as \\"that guy\\" to Ayuna's distress. He is currently under pressure due to the discovery of teenagers within Minkei and appears to have been creating a rival task force. He is last seen talking to Shikie, ostensibly for the purpose of recruiting her, or having her keep tabs on Kou. ;Ayuna Shiraishi The 15-year-old sister of Kou who is a genius at cooking and displays her happiness and affection for her brother by karate- chopping his head. During their childhood, Kou would regularly protect her from bullies, resulting in constant cuts and bruises. Because of this, she possesses a tame brother complex. She is also developing rapidly, outgrowing her bras. She is very popular and gets along well with Mikuru and referred to Kina as \\"sensei\\" when she realised Kina's cooking was even better than her own. She was devastated at her loss. Ayuna later was targeted by the same man that killed Kina in another attempt to bring \\"life\\" to his dolls. Though Kou failed to rescue her, he left his phone on, taping the conversation and allowing Mikuru to hear where they were being taken. Shikie followed his phone's GPS, which was now in Mikuru's hands, leading to a brief scuffle before they joined forces (in a manner of speaking) to deal with the kidnapper. She fully supports her brothers pursuit of Mikuru. ;Kina Monjou An 18-year-old member of Minkei, she was partnered with Kou during the training program a few times. She had an attraction to him due to a habit they shared. Her grandfather was part of the yakuza and was killed along with everyone else in the household by the hitman, Black Dogg. She was hidden at the time and despises yakuza and hitmen. In combat she uses either guns, or a special sword that she is skilled enough with to cut a car in half. Along with Kou and Mikuru, they finally captured Black Dogg, but she was shot in the stomach and spent some time in the hospital. Afterward she retired from Minkei and was planning to go back to her family's home, but while wearing only normal clothing and not carrying any weapons, she was shot and killed by her stalker, who made it look like a mugging, in order to bring his dolls to \\"life\\". Ironically, one of Kina's favorite saying is \\"I'm immortal\\". Her hobbies were cooking and she was on-par with Kou's sister. She gave Kou her treasure after hearing that he loves Mikuru. ;Shikie Misono An elite officer from the Police Force brought in ostensibly to be Mikuru's partner. Sparks however flew from the onset as Shikie relishes killing criminals as opposed to Mikuru's reluctance. Since losing her first partner to gangsters Shikie has little patience for protocol and has several bounties on her head. She immediately dismisses Mikuru and Kou as kids playing at being cops and the situation finally explodes into a savage brawl that leaves both women battered and unconscious. Temporarily assigned to Kou, she finds herself drawn to the younger man's earnestness and gives him his first kiss. Now permanently assigned to Hana Tomozou, she and Mikuru have made a degree of peace which is merely the swapping of the festering hate to a rather intense and very physical rivalry. ;Hana Tomozou Fresh from the Minkei training academy, he is in the team two months after Kina's death. He likes to refer to himself as \\"Ross\\" and gives nicknames to others. He seems to be trigger happy but doesn't kill. He usually paired up with Shikie Misono and calls her \\"Russian\\". While not in Mikuru and Shikie's league, he is still surprisingly capable as an officer and also a skilled ping pong player, being a national champion while in high school. He attempts to use this to gain respect from the two women, only to be knocked out by Mikuru so that she and Shikie could go against each other. He attempts to impart his wisdom on the feminine mind to Kou, having taken an interest in Kou and Mikuru's relationship informing him that her constant jealousy is a positive indicator. Despite this his own romance life is pretty much nonexistent. ;Fujita Nanami 13th division leader of Minkei, age 33. She's married and has a child. She's the most trusted member of the 13th division and is referred to as \\"Leader\\". Her true strength is currently unknown since while she has long been able to cow Mikuru and even Shikie is loath to antagonise her, she has also been seen to be intimidated while witnessing Mikuru training. During the strip ping pong match, she somehow defeated both Mikuru and Shikie brutally, claiming Kou as her prize. Loyal to those under her, she is usually capable of reading her subordinates. Initially pairing Mikuru with Shikie as the most effective team, she quickly changed the assignments after she realised that her plan for them to rage themselves out was a failure. Stating they're like cat and dog, she goes as far as to wish Kou luck whenever he attempts to break up their scuffles. This is a direct contradiction of her home life, as she is depicted to be very relaxed and a slob at home. Secondary Characters ;Tsuyuka Nazume Mikuru's mother, a world-renowned gunsmith, and terrible cook. She is overjoyed when Mikuru displays an interest in boys and is possibly over her father complex. She is the weapon designer for much of Minkei's hardware. She quickly picks up on Kou being the one Mikuru is interested in from her reactions when he stops over for a visit, while Mikuru's girlfriends are over. Attempting to spare Mikuru embaressment, she declares him to be a no blood related sibling. Which causes even more harm. Due to her house been raided several times by gangs looking for guns, she has express permission from the local precinct to discharge her guns inside the building, so long as she record all information. Happiest when using the guns she loves, she is described by the men she shoots as the virgin Mary. ;The Shu Minkei's top agent who was in pursuit of a notorious hitman known simply as \\"202\\". When he located him he requested Mikuru and Yuuji accompany him. A close friend of Yuuji who'd been handling guns since the age of 5, he turned out to be hitman 202, regarding all hunts as \\"training\\". Initially in control, he lost it when Mikuru reverted to her previous mindset before she met Kou, and committed suicide after Mikuru beat him while telling her that she was \\"just like him\\". ;Yuuji Hisamaki The instructor at Minkei Training ground, he's tough but a knowledgeable trainer. He's a Zero-Master and is capable of seeing and blocking Mikuru's \\"Zero In: Burst\\". He was suitably impressed by Kou's development and command potential recommending him to Fujita's Light Knight's B squad. Before dismissing Kou, however, he gave him a taste of what a Zero user could do. Ostensibly he did this after seeing how well Kou and Mikuru worked together. Another meaning would be that he felt Kou had the potential to learn it. He is chain smoker and is almost never seen without a cigarette between his teeth. ;Araki Kazutahito A police officer who is constantly seen as the one enlisting Minkei's help to catch panty thieves (or other perverts), he takes credit when he does nothing and sees Mikuru and Kina as monsters (due to the excessive damage they cause) but he does show concern for them. In chapter 18 he leaves flowers at the place Kina was killed, saying how losing her was unbearable. ;Nomihara Noriko A girl attending Kou's school, she's first seen in chapter 15, being robbed and after Kou saved her, she seems to have a crush on him. Very clumsy, she is a source of constant jealousy for Mikuru as Kou is too good natured to leave her be, and too thick to notice her crush on him. Nicknamed No-No, she joins Mikuru's small circle of girlfriends, and gives up on Kou when she realises how well Mikuru understands him. ;Sakura Sonobe A school friend of Mikuru who writes eromanga for young girls. She takes inspiration from Mikuru, who gets scared by how accurately Sonobe recreates her Minkei life. She is commonly seen either doodling her manga or wandering around school grounds aimlessly until inspiration hits her. Unfortunately for her small circle of friends, she will often resort to using them for inspiration if the need arises. Such a situation occurs in chapter 41 where she cons her friends into the \\"man diet\\". Using Kou (Ayuna was her freshman) she garners inspiration from the activity of the bikini clad girls and the clearly flustered young man. After a beatdown from her enraged friends Sonobe is seen working on her next manga, while Kou has apparently lost considerable weight. ;Fast Frog A courier service of two sisters that transport anything and anyone. Kou was mistaken for Hyodo Tanaka, the brother of an upcoming yakuza boss and taken by them. When the mistake was discovered Kou covered for the pair, pretending to be their \\"brother\\" allowing them time to grab with right person. The younger (13) Mana starts calling him Oniichan (older brother) while the elder is shown blushing while talking to him. They are last seen transporting Snake and Witch after they beat Minkei during the Department store hostage situation. Mana uses a variation of the Zero-In style and Kou notices that she's even faster than Mikuru. The elder possesses a considerable strength, able to almost crush a man's head with one hand. Their car is heavily modified to avoid pursuit (an obvious play on The Transporter). They operate out of a church in the slums with a one-eyed sister as their intermediary.

Once located, however, these villages bear obvious traces of their Greek Christian past in the shape of sizable churches (some of which have been converted into mosques and are therefore well preserved, but with their frescoes covered with whitewash), and a number of rather elegant houses, whose Greekness is betrayed only by the initials and dates (usually about ten years before the 1923 exchange of populations.\\" First opened to tourists in 1964, the village is about 19 km from Nev≈üehir, on the Nev≈üehir-Niƒüde road.

The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor. Cambridge University Press, 2008, , p. 72. \\"Unquestionably, however, Phrygian is most closely linked with Greek.\\" the inhabitants, now converted to christianity, expanded their caverns adding the chapels and Greek inscriptions. This culture is sometimes referred to as Cappadocian Greek. The city was greatly expanded and deepened in the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) era, when it was used for protection from Muslim Arab raids during the four centuries of Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars (780-1180). The city was connected with Derinkuyu underground city through miles of tunnels. Some artifacts discovered in these underground settlements belong to the Middle Byzantine Period, between the 5th and the 10th centuries A.D. These cities continued to be used by the Christian inhabitants as protection from the Mongolian incursions of Timur in the 14th century. After the region fell to the Seljuk Turks of Persia, the cities were used as refuges (Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±œÜœçŒ≥ŒπŒ±) from the Turkish Muslim rulers, and as late as the 20th century the inhabitants, now called R√ªm ('Eastern Romans') by their Ottoman Turkish rulers, were still using the underground cities to escape periodic waves of Ottoman persecution. Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, a Cambridge linguist who conducted research on the Cappodocian Greeks in the area from 1909-1911, recorded that in 1909, When the christian (R√ªm) inhabitants of the region were expelled in 1923 in the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey the tunnels were abandoned. Description The houses in the village are constructed around the nearly one hundred tunnels of the underground city. The tunnels are still used today as storage areas, stables, and cellars. The underground city at Kaymakli differs from Derinkuyu in terms of its structure and layout. The tunnels are lower, narrower, and more steeply inclined. Of the four floors open to tourists, each space is organized around ventilation shafts. This makes the design of each room or open space dependent on the availability of ventilation. A view showing several floors at once. A stable is located on the first floor. The small size of the stable could indicate that other stables exist in the sections not yet opened. To the left of the stable is a passage with a millstone door. The door leads into a church. To the right of the stables are rooms, possibly living spaces. Located on the second floor is a church with a nave and two apses. Located in front of the apses is a baptismal font, and on the sides along the walls are seating platforms. Names of people contained in graves here coincide with those located next to the church, which supports the idea that these graves belonged to religious people. The church level also contains some living spaces. A remarkable block formation of andesite (a volcanic rock) with several holes, used in Kaymakli for cold copper processing. The third floor contains the most important areas of the underground compound: storage places, wine or oil presses, and kitchens. The level also contains a remarkable block of andesite with relief textures. Recently it was shown that this stone was used for cold-forming copper.Nev≈üehir > Underground Settlements > Kaymakli Underground City The stone was hewn from an andesite layer within the complex. In order for it to be used in metallurgy, fifty-seven holes were carved into the stone. The technique was to put copper into each of the holes (about in diameter) and then to hammer the ore into place. The copper was probably mined between Aksaray and Nevsehir. This mine was also used by Asilikhoyuk, the oldest settlement within the Cappadocia Region. The high number of storage rooms and areas for earthenware jars on the fourth floor indicates some economic stability. Kaymakli is one of the largest underground settlements in the region. The large area reserved for storage in such a limited area appears to indicate the need to support a large population underground. Currently only a fraction of the complex is open to the public.

For eighteen years, he was the director of the psychiatry hospital in Melchor Romero (a locality of La Plata in Buenos Aires). He was the first university official in Latin America to be elected thanks to the student's vote. He is considered to be the pioneer of Argentine philosophy. Along with Florentino Ameghino, Juan Vucetich, Almafuerte and Carlos Spegazzini, he is considered to be one of the five wise men of La Plata. Biography = Childhood, youth and family= Alejandro Korn was born in San Vicente, Buenos Aires. His father, Carlos Adolfo Korn, was a liberal German-Prussian doctor and soldier, who had refused to take part in the repression that followed the worker's strike in the textile sector during the Social Revolution in 1848. Sentenced to death, he fled to Switzerland on horseback. There, he studied Medicine and met his future wife, Mar√≠a Verena Meyer. He decided to migrate to Argentina, and there they got married. He settled down in San Vicente (Buenos Aires), where he worked as a doctor and a judge. He promoted the construction of the first flour mill and the lengthening of the railroad tracks to reach the city. He distinguished for his remarkable work fighting the cholera epidemics, and, for that reason, he was awarded by the president Domingo F. Sarmiento. When he died, in 1905, the city of San Vicente paid him homage. Alejandro Korn was the eldest of eight siblings. His only brother, Mauricio, would also become a doctor. In his youth, Alejandro showed an interest in culture and sport. In 1877 he settled down in Buenos Aires to study, first at the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires and later at the Universidad de Buenos Aires's College of Medicine. Afterwards, he met and married Mar√≠a Villafa√±e, and settled in La Plata. They had seven children, four of which survived childhood. One of them, Alejandro Korn Villafa√±e, was instrumental in the University Reform and is distinguished for his insights into catholic doctrine and his teaching position at the modern Escuela de La Plata. His other son, Guillermo Korn, was a left-wing reformer and student leader, journalist, leader of the Socialist Party and national deputy, as well as a playwright and the founder of the Teatro del Pueblo in La Plata. =Doctor= He graduated in 1882, with his thesis Locura y crimen (‚ÄúInsanity and crime‚Äù). He worked in the small towns of Navarro and Ranchos, where he was living at the time. In 1888 he was appointed to police doctor. In 1897 he was appointed to director of the Hospital Provincial de Melchor Romero, a hospital-colony with a surface of 80 hectares (which he would afterwards increase to 180 hectares), designed by his lodge mate Pedro Benoit, placed 10 kilometers away from La Plata city, where Benoit lived. It was inaugurated as a hospital in 1884, but then it specialized in treating mental diseases. It was the first hospital of its kind in Argentine, and, probably, in Latin America. Korn acted as director of Melchor Romero Hospital until 1916, when he resigned from the title in order to devote all his time and energies to philosophy. From 1900 onwards, his brother Mauricia Korn also worked there. In 1910 he founded the Medical Association of La Plata where he acted as its president. =Freemason= Alejandro Korn entered in the Argentine Freemasonry on 15 June 1881, aged 21, in the Germania N¬∫ 19 lodge. His father had entered the same lodge in Germany, and was a long-standing and influential member, who had in fact helped his lodge establish in Argentina, with the help of his Freemason Brothers in the country. When he was 23 years old, Alejandro was appointed to Venerable Maestro (‚ÄúVenerable Master‚Äù) of his lodge. Later, he entered the La Plata N¬∫ 80 lodge, which included other influential inhabitants of La Plata such as Carlos Spegazzini and Pedro Benoit. =Politician= He was a member of Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical (‚ÄúRadical Civic Union‚Äù) since its foundation in 1891, and, in the 1893 Revolution, he was appointed by the Revolutionary Junta to La Plata's Intendant, a title that he held for some days until the defeat of the Revolution. In 1894, he was elected as a deputy of the UCR. He resigned from the title in 1897, to express his disapproval of a series of acts of corruption in the ‚ÄúBanco Hipotecario‚Äù, in which several other members he knew where involved. In 1917 he was elected as a deputy of La Plata again as part of UCR, and he opted to the title of national deputy in 1918. In that year, he left the UCR, embraced the socialist beliefs and wrote Socialismo √©tico (‚ÄúEthical socialism‚Äù) and Incipit Vita Nova: > The new philosophy will liberate us from the nightmare of mechanic > automatism, and will give us back the dignity of our conscious free > personality, free and master of its own destiny‚Ä¶If we want a better world, > we will build it‚Ä¶ Socialism itself, beyond Marx‚Äôs well-known theorem, asks > for solidarity, that is to say, a theoretical feeling. In 1931 he entered the Socialist Party (Argentina). In 1934 he gave a much- praised series of lectures in the ‚ÄúCasa del Pueblo de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires‚Äù (‚ÄúBuenos Aires‚Äôs People‚Äôs House‚Äù). The lectures were titled Jean Jaur√©s, Hegel y Marx (‚ÄúHegel and Marx‚Äù), and Antimarx, and were published by the Revista Socialista (‚ÄúSocialist magazine‚Äù) in February 1935. In 1934 he was elected to be a ‚Äúconvencional constituyente‚Äù to help rewrite the Constitution of the Buenos Aires Province, but he resigned from that title as a protest for the fraud that the government had committed in those elections, as did Alfredo Palacios and his son Guillermo Korn. =University Reformist= Alejandro Korn was not only a teacher, but a high-level official in La Plata's and Buenos Aires's Universities as well. He was also involved in the students‚Äô reformist movement. In fact, both of his sons were leaders of students‚Äô groups, though different ones. In 1903 he entered in the National University of La Plata as councillor and vice-rector, when it was still a provincial one and Dardo Rocha was its rector. From that moment, he was the associate professor of the History of Philosophy Cathedra. The Obstetrics School was created thanks to his initiative. In 1919, in a moment of social unrest, the students‚Äô movement chose him to be responsible for the University, together with Carlos Spegazzini and Edelmiro Calvo. In 1906 he entered as a teacher of the History of Philosophy Cathedra in Buenos Aires's University's Philosophy Faculty. In 1912 he was elected Faculty councillor, a title he held until 1918. That year, with the University Reform as background, he was elected dean by the students of the Philosophy Faculty in the University of Buenos Aires, a title he held until 1921. In 1918, Korn was one of the professors, together with Jos√© Ingenieros, Alfredo Palacios and Jos√© Vasconcelos, to be taken as a model by the students‚Äô organization that promoted the University Reform throughout Latin America. Unlike the situation in Cordoba, where the movement was basically antischolastic, La Plata's reformism was marked by a strong antipositivism because clericalism was almost completely inexistent in La Plata. This antipositivistic reaction was guided by Alejandro Korn. Between 1919 and 1922, he wrote several articles about the impact of the University Reform in the cultural renovation of Latin America. His most remarkable work, La Libertad creadora (‚ÄúThe creative freedom‚Äù) was written as a request from the ‚ÄúCentro de Estudiantes‚Äù, a Buenos Aires Law Student's Association, to be published in their magazine Verbum, in order to give basis to the transforming activities in which the reformist youth was embarked upon. It was written under the concepts that inspired his vision of an ‚Äúethical socialism‚Äù. The former Guatemala president Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo, former pupil of Korn in National University of La Plata defined him as the professor par excellence. Deputy Silvia Augsburger claimed that Korn was the main thinker of the University Reform, in what concerns new syllabuses and modern teaching methods. Those aspects had also an important role in the agitated public debates in which Korn participated. Ahead of his time, following educationalist concepts that would be universally acknowledged in the 1950s, he remarked the need of make the student, as an active and creative subject, the center of the educationalist process. In La Reforma Universitaria (1919), he wrote: > The Reform is a dynamic process, and its purpose is creating a new > University spirit and giving the University back its lost prestige, being > conscious of its mission and dignity. In order to attain so, the student‚Äôs > participation in the University‚Äôs government is essential. They, and only > they, represent the propulsion force, the efficient action, capable of > moving inertia and avoid stagnation. Without them, nothing has been done, > and nothing would have been done. The way in which they must intervene, > that‚Äôs a secondary issue; the important thing is to make sure that they > constitute such a power, that nothing will be done without it. We have > announced the advent of an intense ethical and aesthetical culture, purely > Argentine, noble because of its yearning of social justice; a culture meant > to exceed, without harming Science, an intellectualist and utilitarianist > age. It is pleasing to observe the youth looking for the light of new ideals > through different paths. A free cathedra surrounded by free students, who > own and are responsible for their acts, will contribute towards forging the > national character in a better way than the wordy tutelage of those who > never even had strength of character themselves. =Sportsman= Korn practiced sport, especially fencing, and helped spread it in Argentina, when it wasn‚Äôt the popular activity it is today. In 1891, with an economic, political and social crisis started in 1890 as background, he was elected President of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata, a title he held until 1894. His most remarkable work, together with other leaders, was getting the estate enclosed by the streets N¬∫ 1 and N¬∫ 47 in order to build there the first sport's field of the club. =Philosopher= Together with Jos√© Ingenieros, Alejandro Korn is considered to be the pioneer in Argentine philosophical thinking, and part of the foundational group of Latin American philosophy, together with Cuban Enrique Jos√© Varona, Mexican Jos√© Vasconcelos and Antonio Caso, Peruvian Alejandro Desut√∫a, Uruguayan Carlos Vaz Ferreira, Brazilian Raimundo Far√≠as Brito and Chilean Enrique Molina. Alejandro Korn's thinking inspired a profound renovation of Latin American philosophy, under the principles of the continental University Reform democratizing movement, in a moment when Argentina was experiencing a clash in order to exceed the ‚Äúoligarchic republic‚Äù, which was based on electoral fraud and ‚Äúvoto cantado‚Äù (‚Äúspoken vote‚Äù), and establish a democratic system that had respect for the general will as its core. The people who read his works were mainly young reformist students and left-center political and social activists. The central theme of his work was the study of values and freedom. Two notable works are La libertad creadora (1922) and Axiolog√≠a (1930). The crux of Alejandro Korn's philosophy is the criticism towards positivism and na√Øve realism, that is to say, the principles and conclusions, usually spontaneous, that are considered evident in each age, and which are present in every philosophical system, often as items from the rational analysis that are considered obvious. Korn conceives philosophy as thought intimately related to the culture of the moment, and the moment itself, a reflexion that comes as a by-product of a praxis linked to the problems and will of the specific individuals and democratic communities. =The five wise men of the cultural beacon= La Plata was conceived in 1882 as a cultural excellence center, open to the world, and specially open to Latin America. From its notable urbanistic design to its University and its famous Natural Sciences Museum, all the way up to the city's historical theaters and its extensive students‚Äô, teachers‚Äô and researchers‚Äô communities, with people from several regions and countries, La Plata established itself as an educational and scientific center, often called one of the Latin American cultural beacons. Korn was part of the core of that beacon, together with four other La Plata's citizens known as the five wise men: poet Almafuerte, paleontologist and anthropologist Florentino Ameghino, philosopher Alejandro Korn, biologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini and criminologist Juan Vucetich. The five wise men were broadly the same sage: the two eldest ones, Ameghino and Almafuerte, were born in 1854, and the youngest, Korn himself, was born in 1860. Korn was, in addition, the last to die, in 1936; the first had been Ameghino in 1911. Works =The creative freedom (1920)= The Creative Freedom is a paper first published in 1920, by the Verbum magazine, by the Law Students Centre of the University of Buenos Aires. It was the time of the University Reform, started in 1918 in C√≥rdoba and spread afterwards throughout Latin America, which sought the generalization of the Latin American university kind that was found under a principle of autonomy, and with student participation in its government, as well as cathedra freedom. Korn had a decisive role in the University Reform, as a protagonist (he was the first dean to be elected by the students), and also as a thinker of the movement. In that way, The creative freedom is a profound philosophical reflexion about freedom, that sought boosting the role of the common man and woman, the ‚Äúfree subject‚Äù, as Korn called it, in the voluntarily transformation of the world. Eugenio Pucciarelli wrote in the prologue to The creative freedom that ‚Äúfreedom is experienced as a liberation, as an emancipation from servitude, as an overcoming of an obstacle, as a triumph over resistance‚Äù. Korn himself stated that ‚Äúour freedom would plunge if it were not leaning on the resistance that opposes it‚Äù. The dynamics of antinomies is a fundamental trait of Alejandro Korn's thought. With the same approaching method, Korn stated that justice itself doesn‚Äôt exist, that there's only injustice and the constant fight against it towards the ideal of justice. In order to understand the dynamics of freedom, Alejandro Korn started from the comprehension of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù as active entities, bestowed with their own initiative. > The subject does not stand before the world in a contemplative attitude, he > is not, in any way, a disinterested spectator. Consciousness is the theater > for the conflicts and harmonies between the subject that feel, judges and > wants, and the object that adjusts and resists. Korn gave priority to the concept of present time over the concept of reality. Reality, defined from the idea of thing, tends to form a static and passive field, whereas present time, defined from the idea of act, tends to form dynamic processes, always changing and influenced by human decisions. From this theory, Korn outlined a criticism for language when he says: > A philosophy treatise, in order to be logical, should be written using verbs > and not a single noun. We never use a verb without referring it to a noun or > a pronoun that substitutes it. This way of using the language, suggested by > the relative stagnancy of things, derives from na√Øve realism and leads us > towards mistakes. Korn approached the concept of creative freedom through the antinomy of the objective world and the subjective world. The objective world, he said, obeys necessary rules, whereas the subjective world has no rules, it's free. > Kant‚Äôs third antinomy states, in a concise way, the philosophical problem > par excellence: the joint affirmation of necessity and freedom. From this conflict between freedom and necessity emerges a permanent process of both scientific and technical development that seeks obtaining power over the objective world and ethical self-domain of the subjective world that seeks subjugating necessity to freedom, thus reaching freedom itself in its uttermost development, dynamically linking power and will (desire). Freedom, thus understood, as an action, transformation and taking of an ethical position by an autonoumus subject, is referred to as creative freedom by Alejandro Korn Homage The following items hold his name: *The town he was born in, previously known as Empalme San Vicente, was named after him in 1964. *The Melchor Romero Neuropsychiatry Hospital, that he directed in the period 1898‚Äì1916, was named Alejandro Korn in 1954. *The Alejandro Korn's People's University, founded the year of his death, which has been active since then. *A c√°tedra libre (‚Äúfree cathedra‚Äù) in National University of La Plata, created in 1997 in order to spread his thoughts and analyze novelties in art, science and philosophy. *A student's reformist association in National University of Rosario.

Only a few Polish POW's were captured in other engagements, as the Soviet offensive terminated with the Battle of Warsaw. Even fewer Polish POW's were taken from many tiny Polish military units participating in the Russian Civil War. After the capitulation of the 5th Division, the Soviet administration, disregarding a treaty signed with Poland, imprisoned the Polish POW's, and subsequently decided to treat them as guilty of crimes against the Soviet state. POWs Some POWs, primarily officers were executed, others were sentenced to serve time in jail, and the rest of the Polish soldiers were pressed to serve as forced labour (katorga) in the so-called Yenisey Brigade. The prisoners had no access to medical care or medication. Their daily food rations were made of half a pound of bread and watery soup. Moreover, the guards were robbing the prisoners, in some instances even taking their clothing. The spread of diseases (like typhoid) contributed to the high mortality rate.

The tribe consists of more than 10 million men and women. The member tribes of the Bakil Confederation are found primarily in the far north of the country; its leaders today are the Abulohom family.  Ancient history  Hashid and Bakil were the sons of Jashim bin Jubran bin Nawf bin Tuba'a bin Zayd bin Amro bin Hamdan. Bani Hamdan was already a well known clan in the 1st century AD and it was mentioned in Sabean inscriptions. Therefore, Hashid and Bakil (the brothers) must have lived in the BC era. In the Middle Sabaean period (the 1st to 4th centuries CE) the Bakil confederation consisted of three sha\`bs - Raydah, Amran, and Shibam.Andrey Korotayev. Pre-Islamic Yemen. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 1996. . In the 3rd century most of Hamdan Hamdani tribes that remained in Yemen migrated to Syria. Hashid and Bakil switched their alliance to Himyar.  Conversion to Islam  In the year 622, prophet Muhammad sent Khalid ibn Al-Walid to Yemen to call them to Islam. However, Khaled managed to push the Najrani and Tihami Yemenis into Islam, but he didn't get a warm response from the Hamdani Yemenis of the highlands. So Muhammad sent over Ali bin Abi Talib, and he was much more successful in converting the Hamdani Yemenis. After the death of Muhammad, the Hamdan tribe remained Muslim and didn't join the ridda movement.  After Ali, power vacuum in Yemen and the Imam Hadi The Hamdan tribe remained on the side of Ali, after the defeat of Ali and later his sons. The tribes remained on alliance to Ali but didn't oppose the Umayyads or ally themselves with the other Shias. At that time Yemen was experiencing a great population movement forming the bulk of the Islamic Expansion mainly settling and Arabizing North Africa/Spain. However, the majority of the Hamdan tribe remained in Yemen which later helped the Hashid/Bakil Hamdani tribes become the biggest local key player, benefiting from the departure of the bulk of the most powerful Nomadic Yemeni tribes of that time into North Africa/Spain in Wetsward movements that continued until the 13th century. By the 10th century the Imam al-Hadi Yahya bin al-Hussain bin al-Qasim (a scion of Imam al-Hasan (as), grandson of the Prophet) who, at Sa'da, in 893-7 C.E. arrived to the Northern Highlands on invitation from the Hamdan tribe and from that time till present day the Zaidi moderate Shia teachings became dominant in north Yemen.  Modern history  Imam Yahya's campaign to subject the country, and more specifically the tribes, to his control, led him to undertake massive campaigns against their influence and power; in fact, his efforts succeeded in permanently eliminating all but two of the ancient confederations (the Hashid is the other one to survive). Many writers have referred to the Hashid and Bakil confederations as the \\"two wings\\" of the Zaidi imamate; in the sense that many of the tribes that belong to these confederations are and were strongly committed to Zaidi Islam, the imams were recognized - to a greater or lesser degree - as the heads of the Zaidi community and could, therefore, count on a measure of support and loyalty. Not all the tribes, however, accepted the temporal and even legal role that the imams arrogated to themselves; consequently, many imams (Imam Yahya and Imam Ahmad in the twentieth century included) complained bitterly about the tribes' inordinate political power.

First appointed as interim mayor, he won a special election to become mayor in 2001, and was then re-elected to four full terms, becoming the longest-serving mayor of Monroe, surpassing the mark previously held by William Lorenzo Howard. Twice in one year, Mayo was an unsuccessful candidate for Louisiana's 5th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives. He lost a runoff election on December 6, 2014, to the Republican candidate, Ralph Lee Abraham, Jr., a physician and former veterinarian from Mangham in Richland Parish. Abraham polled 134,612 votes (64.2 percent) to Mayo's 75,004 (35.8 percent). Background A native of Mer Rouge in Morehouse Parish, Mayo graduated from Bastrop High School in Bastrop, the Morehouse Parish seat of government. He then completed a degree in business administration from the University of Louisiana at Monroe, where he played basketball under Coach Lenny Fant. Prior to becoming mayor, he was employed by State Farm Insurance, Allstate Insurance, and the Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation. He is married to the former Angela Washington. They have two children, Jared and Ashley, graduates of historically black Grambling State University in Grambling, Louisiana. Mayo is a member of the New Light Baptist Church, Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, the Prince Hall Masonic lodge, and the Monroe Rotary International. Political campaigns In 1992, Mayo lost a runoff election to Charles H. Johnson for the Monroe City Council from District 5, but he rebounded on November 18, 1995, when he defeated Robert C. Johnson in a special election for the unexpired council term formerly held by Charles Johnson, who died in office. Mayo won full terms on the council in 1996 and 2000. In June 2001, Mayo was appointed interim mayor by the city council upon the death of Republican Mayor Melvin Rambin, a banker who had served only eleven-and-a-half months in the position. Mayo then won a special election as Rambin's permanent successor in October 2001, when he defeated fellow Democrat Guy Barr, Jr., 8,598 (51.2 percent) to 8,117 (48.4 percent). Another .4 of 1 percent was cast for a \\"No Party\\" candidate. Though Barr, also a State Farm Insurance agent, ran as a Democrat, he was a donor in 2000 to several Republican candidates. In November 2001, Mayo's former council opponent, Robert C. Johnson, was elected to succeed Mayo in District 5. Mayo was reelected mayor to full four-year terms on April 17, 2004, February 9, 2008, April 21, 2012, and March 4, 2016. In the 2008 campaign, he retained the Republican consultant Lee Fletcher. Mayo told a friend that hiring Fletcher made the difference between victory and defeat. In 2012, Mayo won his fourth term as mayor by defeating the Republican Dr. Ray Armstrong. In a 38 percent voter turnout, Mayo received 6,591 votes (54 percent) to Armstrong's 5,574 (46 percent).\\"Jamie Mayo wins re-election\\", Monroe News Star, April 22, 2012, p. 1 In addition to Armstrong, Mayo faced a challenge from the third-place candidate, Democrat Johnny Riley, a former Mayo administration official who left a position with the Louisiana Workforce Commission to run for mayor.The Ouachita Citizen, March 1, 2012 Opponents of Mayo ran a controversial YouTube video entitled \\"Say No to Mayo\\", which attacks questionable city spending, the treatment of the police force, the inadequacy of the municipal drainage system, and the favoritism shown to Mayo supporters in the administration of city government. Mayo replied that the video is a scurrilous unfounded attack on his administration. In July 2014, Dr. Armstrong was named chairman of the city council by a unanimous vote of his colleagues. Mayo said that his relationship with former opponent Armstrong has been distant: \\"I hope as chairman he will see the need to be more cooperative and work with the administration to continue the aggressive advancements we've made in several areas prior to the changing of the council.\\" Armstrong said that \\"communication is key. We will always have differences in opinion, but it should be done in healthy and respectful ways. I think the City Council took a lot of hits previously because we didn't communicate with people and the media,\\" Armstrong replied to Mayo. In March, 2016, Mayo won his fifth term as mayor in a re-match against his 2012 opponent Dr. Ray Armstrong with 58 percent of the vote. A member of the Democratic Party, he endorsed Barack Obama of Illinois in the 2008 U.S. presidential election and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.http://www.thenewsstar.com/story/news/2016/02/23/mayo-endorses- hillary-clinton/80799772/ In July, 2020, Mayo was defeated in his bid for a sixth term by Friday Ellis, who ran as an independent, in a primary election that included two other Democratic candidates and a Libertarian candidate. The primary had been postponed due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.  2013 U.S. House bid  Mayo was a candidate in Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election, 2013, held on October 19, to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Republican Rodney Alexander. He finished third among fourteen candidates with 15,317 votes (15 percent). Mayo led in the parishes of Morehouse, East Carroll, Madison, and Tensas; the latter three have African- American majorities. The top two vote-getters, both Republicans, State Senator Neil Riser of Columbia in Caldwell Parish, and political newcomer Vance McAllister, a businessman from Swartz near Monroe, met in the November 16 runoff election to select the new congressman, with McAllister winning by a large margin. Another African-American candidate from Monroe, State Representative Marcus Hunter, polled 3,088 votes (3 percent). Had all of Hunter's votes been cast for Mayo, the mayor, not McAllister, would have entered the runoff contest with Riser with a cushion of nineteen votes. Along with Mayo and Hunter, two other Republicans seeking the seat, State Representative Jay Morris of Monroe and Clyde C. Holloway, a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission and a former U.S. representative, were eliminated. A third Democrat in the race, State Representative Robert A. Johnson of Marksville finished fifth with 9,971 votes (10 percent). Former state Representative Weldon Russell, a Democrat from Amite in Tangipahoa Parish, polled 2 percent of the vote, almost all of in and around Tangipahoa Parish, where he won a plurality as also in adjacent St. Helena and Washington parishes. Riser was supported by three sitting Republican congressmen from Louisiana; McAllister, a native of West Carroll Parish, had the celebrity endorsement of Phil Robertson of the A&E; Network reality show, Duck Dynasty, filmed in West Monroe. After his elimination from the congressional race, Mayo endorsed McAllister, whom he declared \\"more approachable\\" than Riser. In February 2014, Mayo received the Fannie Lou Hamer Community Service and Leadership Award from Grambling State University, during a Martin Luther King, Jr., luncheon on the campus. 2014 congressional race On July 5, 2014, Mayo confirmed that he would again run for Congress for the seat held by Vance McAllister. A supporter of U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu, Mayo was this time the only major Democrat in the U.S. House race, a nonpartisan blanket primary held on November 4 at the same time as general elections in the other forty-nine states. A few weeks after McAllister's announcement of non-candidacy, which stemmed from the revelation of McAllister's kissing a staff aide, who was married to a close friend of McAllister's, the congressman reversed himself and said that he was a candidate for a full term in the primary election. A poll by the Glascock Group released in early August 2014 showed McAllister leading Mayo, 27 to 21 percent. Dr. Ralph Abraham polled third with 18 percent. In fourth place was Zach Dasher, a pharmaceutical salesman and a cousin of stars of the television series Duck Dynasty, with 14 percent. Dasher was followed by Ed Tarpley, an Alexandria lawyer and a Republican former district attorney for Grant Parish, with 9 percent, and Monroe Republican businessman Harris Brown at 6 percent. Libertarian Party candidate Clay Grant of Boyce in Rapides Parish, trailed with 5 percent. In individual match-ups with his opponents, McAllister is shown to be highly vulnerable. In the 2014 congressional primary, Mayo led all candidates with 67,610 votes (28.2 percent) to Abraham's 55,487 (23.2 percent). Dasher finished third with 53,627 (22.4 percent), and McAllister ran fourth with 26,605 (11.1 percent). In the second round of balloting, however, Dr. Abraham handily defeated Mayor Mayo. Despite his unsuccessful congressional campaigns, Mayo handily won reelection to his fifth term as mayor in the primary election held on March 5, 2016. He defeated three opponents, the strongest of whom was his longstanding Republican critic on the city council, Ray Armstrong. Mayo received 7,423 votes (59 percent) to Armstrong's 4,369 (34.7 percent). Two other contenders, a Democrat and a No Party candidate held the remaining 6.4 percent of the ballots cast.

History and progress  In 1984, American Vietnam War veterans who had been exposed to dioxin, a carcinogen found in the herbicide Agent Orange, one of many toxic substances sprayed by the US military in Southern Vietnam, won a $180 million lawsuit against the chemicals‚Äô manufacturers, citing wrongful injury to thousands of veterans and their families. A fund was created to help compensate troops for health problems believed to be caused by exposure to these toxins. Although the Vietnam Red Cross estimates that 3 million Vietnamese people have been affected by Agent Orange, including 150,000 children born with birth defects, no funding was provided to ease its impact on Vietnamese victims. The Vietnam Friendship Village Project was instituted in 1988 American veteran George Mizohttps://www.ncronline.org/news/justice/charles-liteky-former-army- chaplain-who-returned-medal-honor-protest-dies, beginning as a personal mission of reparation and reconciliation for the part he played in the Vietnam War and the effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese Peoplehttps://www.ledger-enquirer.com/opinion/op-ed/article200772134.html. Initially intended as a residential facility in Vietnam with education, health, and rehabilitation services capable of caring for up to 250 children and 100 adults, the facility also became a place of reconciliation between Vietnam and the United states and its allieshttps://www.bbc.com/news/in- pictures-33408096https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health/article/1153160/vietnamese- school-trains-disabled-victims-agent-orange. Today, the Vietnam Friendship Village provides a home to approximately 120 children with a variety of mental and physical disabilities believed to be caused by Agent Orange. The children, ages ranging between 6 and 20, receive education, medical care, vocational training, and physical therapy. Volunteers equip them with life skills meant to help them reintegrate into their communities as members of the workforce. The village also provides support and education to approximately 1000 Vietnamese veterans annually and helps them improve their health through medical treatment.

The word Zangha is Persian for \\"The Rings\\" (as in telephone rings). Plot The citizens of an unnamed city are being terrorized by an extraordinary killer. The victims pick up a ringing phone and are told by a mysterious voice how long they have to live. Invariably, they all die in mysterious ways at the exact specified moment. A reporter begins to investigate the phenomenon, but the more he investigates the deaths the more mysterious they seem. As he delves into more cases, he becomes personally involved and obsessed. Before long, he finds his family and finally himself targets of the elusive killer. The film ends with the reporter's death.

They tend to increase the overall effectiveness of the group and create a more positive atmosphere of interaction within the group. Concept Maintenance actions are contrasted with Task Actions which are those actions taken to enable the group to complete a specific task or goal.Johnson, D. and Johnson, F. Joining Together: Group Theory and Skills. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1975. Conceptually developed by social psychologist Kurt Lewin in his extensive research into group interaction during the 1940s,Lewin, K., \\"Group Decisions and Social Change\\" in T. Newcomb and E. Hartley (eds.) Readings In Social Psychology. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1947. maintenance actions were extended into the discipline of leadership studies through the work of Douglas McGregor in his definitive statement of principles of leadership, The Human Side of Enterprise.McGregor,D. The Human Side of Enterprise. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960. Countless texts and \\"how to\\" manuals on group and team leadership since Lewin's work have sought to identify those activities which can then be used in group situations to maintain as well as increase friendship, warmth, and attachment among the participants of a group. Maintenance actions can be understood as those activities which maintain the functioning of the group just as a driver of a car maintains the car by putting oil in the engine or making sure that the tires have enough pressure. Types Lewin specifically identified ten types of maintenance actions: encourager of participation; harmonizer and compromiser; tension reliever; communication helper; evaluator of emotional climate; process observer; standard setter; active listener; trust builder; and interpersonal problem solver. The most identifiable and popular of the ten types is the tension reliever or the person who relieves the tension within the group by telling jokes and stories, suggesting breaks or fun (as opposed to task) activities. (Later group and leadership writers frequently identify the person taking on this role as the group \\"clown\\".) In contrast, often the hardest to identify is that of the process observer, similar to a participant observer, or the person who watches the interaction within the group as it unfolds and shares their observations with the other group members by continually pointing out ways in which the group behaviors become inconsistent or erratic which could throw the group off track in its attempt to accomplish a goal. The type considered by group facilitators to be the most valuable role is that of interpersonal problem solver or the person who has the natural ability to help people solve their problems in a non-professional manner and draws other people in the group to them by their warmth and openness.Hartford, M. Groups In Social Work. New York: Columbia University Press, 1972. Behaviour theory The success of Lewin's work in defining these group activities is attributable to his explanation of them in behavior theory terms within the context of role theory . This was in contrast to both previous and subsequent research which would utilize such picturesque but often unrealistic terms for group behaviors such as the eagle, the bear, or the possum (creating confusion among group participants who may not share the same ideas of animal behavior as the theorist who proposed the terms). Lewin also sought to explain these maintenance actions within the context of immediate experience of the group participant as opposed to roles associated with a person's individual personality. Group psychotherapist Irvin YalomYalom, I. The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy. New York: Basic Books, 1975. presents a contrasting view to Lewin in his position that group behaviors are developed in an individual's first group experiences (primarily in their family of origin) and then carried with them from group to group for the rest of their lives. Maintenance actions can also be seen as occurring on three levels of interaction within the group.Garvin, C. and Jones, A. \\"Group Work\\" in The Encyclopedia of Social Work (16th Ed.) Washington, D.C.: NASW Press, 1972. On the primary level there are individual actions within the group which can be seen as maintenance actions. On the secondary level there are people whose majority of actions identify them as having a maintenance personality. On the highest level there are groups which take on the role of social interaction and support as their primary goal which are then identified as maintenance groups. Maintenance groups are seen frequently in society as in a support group, collections of people who meet with the intention of bonding and problem solving through shared experiences such as groups of cancer survivors or people coping with the loss of a loved one. Maintenance actions have moved on to become the core of several social psychology theories of leadership and group interaction such as Fiedler's distributed actions model of group leadership;Fiedler, F. A Theory of Leadership Effectiveness. New York: McGraw- Hill, 1967. Bales' Interaction Process Analysis model;Bales, R. Interaction Process Analysis. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1950. and Blanchard and Hershey's leadership effectiveness model.Blanchard, P. and Hershey, K. Management of Organizational Behavior: Utilizing Human Resources. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969. Blanchard and Hershey have argued that more successful leaders combine both maintenance and task actions to a certain extent depending on the group members' abilities and experiences in order to achieve the most successful style and process of group leadership. Their concept is vividly underscored in Herman Wouk's popular novel, The Caine MutinyWouk, H. The Caine Mutiny. New York: Doubleday, 1951. where Wouk contrasts the effectiveness of a total task action oriented leader in the character of Captain Queeg versus the leader who combines maintenance and task actions in the character of Captain De Vriess. In the novel, the failure of Queeg to accurately identify the necessary combination of maintenance and task actions to suit the particular setting of the fictional Navy ship the U.S.S. Caine may be seen to lead to his inevitable downfall and the \\"mutiny\\" of the crew during a particularly life-threatening mission in the midst of a typhoon. This theme was repeated later in a cinematic form more recently in the movie Crimson Tide which pitted a task action oriented Captain (played by Gene Hackman) against a maintenance action Executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) in a battle for the crews' hearts and minds on a fictitious U.S. naval submarine. A more popular view among group leaders and facilitators today is that groups rarely see leaders who exclusively choose one extreme of task actions versus the other extreme of maintenance actions, and are more likely to see a leader whose style is to combine the two styles of leadership in varying ways in relation to their own understanding of their ability to lead.

It is the 74th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are a trio of aviators known as the Wrong Brothers in the \\"Republic of Cannabeer, P.U.\\" who receive an army draft notice. The notice says the brothers have been granted a 30-day deferment of duty on account of their claims that the aircraft they are inventing, the ‚ÄúBuzzard‚Äù, will revolutionize flying. Curly proudly announces that their aircraft has put them among other \\"great inventors\\" like Robert Fulton, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and Don Ameche. The boys get to work, but a series of mishaps cause them to get sidetracked; Moe twice gets knocked into a tub of quick-drying melted rubber. The first time it happens, Larry and Curly try to get the rubber off Moe by expanding the rubber with hydrogen, turning him into a human balloon. Unfortunately, Moe floats to the top of the aircraft hangar and into the sky, and Larry and Curly take aim with a shotgun and blast him to safety, resulting in Moe falling down in his long johns into a nearby well. Later, just as the boys are ready to test the Buzzard, they realize the aircraft is too wide to move out of the hangar. This problem is solved when the Stooges saw a larger opening in the hangar. But then they have another problem trying to start the propeller. Moe pushes the propeller to get it to start, but the propeller swings back at him and carries him for numerous revolutions before he is thrown off - where he lands in the same tub of rubber cement from before. They eventually begin a test flight of the aircraft for a pair of aircraft company officials from the Sky Aircraft Company, but things begin to go awry. Curly accidentally breaks the rudder cable, Moe orders him to throw out the clutch, Curly unable to find it, throws out the gear shift lever instead. Moe attempts to repair the rudder cable but fails and the aircraft turns upside down and the three fall right back into the same well as before, dousing the aircraft officials with water as they splash into the well's bottom. As expected, the Stooges are drafted into the army, where they run afoul with their drill sergeant (Richard Fiske), disrupting marching and weapons handling drills. Eventually, the three of them have had enough. They knock out the drill instructor by hitting him with their guns and knocking him out, allowing them to escape.

The Derinkuyu underground city (Cappadocian Greek: Malakopi) is an ancient multi-level underground city in the Derinkuyu district in Nev≈üehir Province, Turkey, extending to a depth of approximately . It is large enough to have sheltered as many as 20,000 people together with their livestock and food stores. It is the largest excavated underground city in Turkey and is one of several underground complexes found throughout Cappadocia. Features The underground city at Derinkuyu could be closed from the inside with large stone doors. Each floor could be closed off separately. The city could accommodate up to 20,000 people and had amenities found in other underground complexes across Cappadocia, such as wine and oil presses, stables, cellars, storage rooms, refectories, and chapels. Unique to the Derinkuyu complex and located on the second floor is a spacious room with a barrel-vaulted ceiling. It has been reported that this room was used as a religious school and the rooms to the left were studies. Starting between the third and fourth levels are a series of vertical staircases, which lead to a cruciform church on the lowest (fifth) level. The large ventilation shaft appears to have been used as a well. The shaft provided water to both the villagers above and, if the outside world was not accessible, to those in hiding. History 'School' in the underground city. Caves might have been built initially in the soft volcanic rock of the Cappadocia region by the Phrygians in the 8th‚Äì7th centuries BCE, according to the Turkish Department of Culture.Turkish Department of Culture When the Phrygian language died out in Roman times, replaced with its close relative the Greek language, the inhabitants, now Christian, expanded their caverns to deep multiple-level structures adding the chapels and Greek inscriptions. The city at Derinkuyu was fully formed in the Byzantine era, when it was heavily used as protection from Muslim Arabs during the Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars (780‚Äì1180 CE). The city was connected with other underground cities through many kilometers of tunnels. Some artifacts discovered in these underground settlements belong to the Middle Byzantine Period, between the 5th and the 10th centuries. These cities continued to be used by the Christian natives as protection from the Mongolian incursions of Timur in the 14th century. After the region fell to the Ottomans, the cities were used as refuges (Cappadocian Greek: ) by the natives from the Turkish Muslim rulers. As late as the 20th century, the local population, Cappadocian Greeks, were still using the underground cities to escape periodic waves of wars. For example, Richard MacGillivray Dawkins, a Cambridge linguist who conducted research from 1909 to 1911 on the Cappadocian Greek speaking natives in the area, recorded such an event as having occurred in 1909: \\"When the news came of the recent massacres at Adana, a great part of the population at Axo took refuge in these underground chambers, and for some nights did not venture to sleep above ground.\\" In 1923, the Christian inhabitants of the region were expelled from Turkey and moved to Greece in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, whereupon the tunnels were abandoned. In 1963, the tunnels were rediscovered after a resident of the area found a mysterious room behind a wall in his home. Further digging revealed access to the tunnel network. In 1969, the site was opened to visitors, with about half of the underground city currently accessible. Other underground cities Nev≈üehir Province has several other historical underground cities including Kaymaklƒ± Underground City. The underground cities and structures are carved out of unique geological formations. They may have been used as hiding places during times of raids. The locations are now archaeological tourist attractions. They remain generally unoccupied. More than 200 underground cities of at least two levels have been discovered in the area between Kayseri and Nevsehir. Some 40 of those include three or more levels.

Sokha was used as unit of taxation for worked land owned by someone else or the State. The term originated when Tatars took rent from the actual plows - the land working tool which used 2-3 horses. At the end of 15th century Novgorod sokha equalled 3 –æ–±–∂s. A Moscow sokha was equal to 10 Novgorod ones and was paid according to the different sizes in various regions of the state. In 1550 a new land-measure unit was established which kept the old name sokha. The name was then used for a certain amount of exploited land. A sokha was divided into quarters. There were several types of sokha: # government ‚Äì 800 quarters of best land; # church ‚Äì 600 quarters of best land; # black ‚Äì 400 quarters of best land. Here, government meant someone who was working in government sectors, and black meant an average person (\\"the masses\\"), quarter or quart meant an area of land that is planted with a quarter of rye. The land was planted in such a way that the area of land seeded with two quarters was equal to a desyatina (an area of land approximately equal to one hectare). Because of the different types of sokha, land owned by lower classes was worth less towards the tax, and most of the tax was paid by the peasants. Given the same amount of land, they paid twice as much as government officials, and 1.5 times as much as church officials. In order to find out how many sokhas were in the state, a census measured and counted the rented lands. Quarters of land that were planted for personal use were free from payment. Until the beginning of the 17th century, a peasant who lived and worked on the land owned by a government employee, just like a peasant living on their own land or state land, paid equally for each exploited quarter of land. This section of land was called living. At the beginning of the 17th century, the term living quarter was used not for the actual quarter of worked land, but for several whole farms in which more than a single quarter was planted. This was done in the interest of government officials - their lands were used to establish living quarters which constituted 10-16 yards. This means that if every yard was divided into 4 quarters (two desyatinas), then such a living quarter was then 40 to 64 quarters of actual quarters of utilized land. Therefore, 40 to 64 quarters of government official land paid the same amount of tax as one peasant paid from the single quarter that he lived on (whether self- or state- owned). In 1678‚Äì1679 the sokha was replaced with the yard count, meaning taxes were to be paid for the number of peasant yards, rather than the area of the land occupied by the yards. Taxes from small villages was also collected in sokhas. The term sokha remained but now it referred to a certain number of yards/houses. There were several types of sokha again: best, average, lesser, and worst villagers. Sokha of the best villages was equal to 40 yards, average - 80, lesser - 160, and worst - 320 yards. Every sokha was charged the same amount of tax. Therefore, best villages paid the same amount for half the number of farms than the average ones. If there were not enough lesser or worst sokhas, then the tax was charged from the people that lived in average or best sokhas.  Literature * Knyazkov S.

History  Price, President & Artistic Director of the Jazz Bakery, is a jazz singer from Philadelphia who toured with bassist/composer Charles Mingus and recorded with drummer Shelly Manne and guitarist Johnny Smith. She created the Jazz Bakery after booking several clubs and restaurants around Los Angeles. In its first incarnation the Jazz Bakery opened in photographer Jim Britt's studio located in the historic Helms Bakery complex, with concerts held on weekends. In 1994, the organization opened a dedicated venue in the Helms Bakery building itself and started presenting music seven nights a week in a semi-formal setting without interruptions for drink or food service. A rectangular theater with a caf√© in the lobby, the venue booked Southern California jazz musicians and touring artists from New York City and Europe. Since its founding the venue has hosted hundreds of jazz stars, including Benny Carter, Red Mitchell, Roger Kellaway, McCoy Tyner, Kevin Eubanks, Dave Holland, Peter Erskine, Johnny Griffin, George Coleman, Paul Bley, Lee Konitz, Fred Hersch, Terence Blanchard, Brad Mehldau, Charlie Haden, Dianne Reeves, Art Farmer, Roy Haynes, Cedar Walton, Randy Weston, George Cables, Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, James Moody, The Heath Brothers, Marian McPartland, Teddy Edwards, Harold Land, Sonny Fortune, Yusef Lateef, Ahmad Jamal, Jimmy Rowles, Alan Broadbent, Blossom Dearie, Bud Shank, Pete Christlieb, Ricky Woodard, Billy Harper, Ernie Watts, Billy Childs, Gordon Goodwin, Tomasz Sta≈Ñko, Elvin Jones, Adam Rudolph, Louis Bellson, Billy Higgins, Mose Allison, Benny Golson, Myra Melford, Antonio S√°nchez (drummer), Kurt Rosenwinkel, Joe Lovano, Mark Murphy (singer), Abbey Lincoln, Nicholas Payton, Ernie Andrews, Frank Morgan (musician), Cecil Taylor, Cyrus Chestnut, Dafnis Prieto, Avishai Cohen (bassist), Don Byron, and Eric Reed (musician). Upon losing its lease in the Helms Bakery Building in 2009, the Jazz Bakery has presented an ongoing 'Movable Feast' concert series at venues around Los Angeles while looking for a permanent new residence. In late 2010 the Annenberg Foundation awarded the Jazz Bakery a $2 million grant as capital campaign seed money for a new building.Jazz Bakery Finds New Home in Culver City, Los Angeles Times, Jan. 14, 2011. In January 2012, Culver City, California transferred a parcel at 9814 Washington Blvd. next to the Kirk Douglas Theatre in the downtown arts district as a site for a new building, which is being designed by architect Frank Gehry. The new Jazz Bakery is slated to present year-round performances and educational programs in two state-of-the-art theaters, with an art gallery, virtual museum and cafe/bar, a plan for which the organization is still raising funds. The Jazz Bakery also announced in 2012 that violinist Jeff Gauthier, who founded and runs Cryptogramophone Records and helped launch the Angel City Jazz Festival, is joining the organization as Executive Director. The Jazz Bakery is now co- producing the Angel City Jazz Festival.

The terms ligninases and lignases are older names for the same class, but the name \\"lignin-modifying enzymes\\" is now preferred, given that these enzymes are not hydrolytic but rather oxidative (electron withdrawing) by their enzymatic mechanisms. LMEs include peroxidases, such as lignin peroxidase (), manganese peroxidase (), versatile peroxidase (), and many phenoloxidases of the laccase type. LMEs have been known to be produced by many species of white rot basidiomycetous fungi, including: Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora, Trametes versicolor, Phlebia radiata, Pleurotus ostreatus and Pleurotus eryngii. LMEs are produced not only by wood-white rotting fungi but also by litter- decomposing basidiomycetous fungi such as Agaricus bisporus (common button mushroom), and many Coprinus and Agrocybe species. The brown-rot fungi, which are able to colonize wood by degrading cellulose, are only able to partially degrade lignin. Some bacteria also produce LMEs, although fungal LMEs are more efficient in lignin degradation. Fungi are thought to be the most substantial contributors to lignin degradation in natural systems. LMEs and cellulases are crucial to ecologic cycles (for example, growth/death/decay/regrowth, the carbon cycle, and soil health) because they allow plant tissue to be decomposed quickly, releasing the matter therein for reuse by new generations of life. LMEs are also crucial to a number of different industries.  Industry Application  Lignin-modifying enzymes have been actively used in the paper and pulp industry for the last decade. They were used in the industry shortly after they were discovered to have both detoxifying and decolorizing properties; properties that the pulp industry spends over $100 million USD annually on to pursue. Although these enzymes have been applied to industry for the last ten years, optimal and robust fermentative processes have not been established. There is an area of active research as scientists believe that the lack of optimal conditions for these enzymes are limiting industrial exploitation. Lignin-modifying enzymes benefit industry as they can break down lignin; a common waste product of the paper and pulp industry. These enzymes have been used in the refinement of poplar as lignin inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of treated poplar and Lignin-modifying enzymes can efficiently degrade the lignin thus fixing this problem. Another use of lignin modifying enzymes is the optimization of plant biomass use. Historically, only a small fraction of plant biomass use could actually be extracted from pulp sources leaving the majority of the plants as waste products. Due to Lignin, the plant waste is relatively inert towards degradation and causes the large accumulation of waste products. LMEs can effectively break it down into other aromatic compounds. LMEs were initially used for the bleaching of waste effluent. Now there are several patented processes that make use of these enzymes for pulp bleaching, many of which are still under development. The environmental industry has interest in using LMEs for the degradation of xenobiotic compounds. There is active research into the detoxification of herbicides by LMEs. Trametes versicolor was shown to effectively degraded Glyphosate in vitro.  Bacterial lignin-modifying enzymes  Although much research has been done to understand fungal LMEs, only recently has more focus been placed on characterizing these enzymes in bacteria. The main LMEs in both fungi and bacteria are peroxidases and laccases. Although bacteria lack homologs to the most common fungal peroxidases (lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, and versatile peroxidase), many produce dye decolourizing peroxidases (DyP-type peroxidases). Bacteria from a variety of classes express DyP peroxidases, including Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Peroxidases depolymerize lignin by oxidation using hydrogen peroxide. Fungal peroxidases have higher oxidizing power than bacterial DyP- type peroxidases studied so far, and are able to degrade more complex lignin structures. DyP-type peroxidases have been found to work on a large range of substrates, including synthetic dyes, monophenolic compounds, lignin-derived compounds, and alcohols. Laccases, which are multicopper oxidases, are another class of enzymes found in both bacteria and fungi which have significant lignin-degrading properties. Laccases degrade lignin by oxidation using oxygen. Laccases are also widely distributed among bacterial species, including Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosum. Like DyP-type peroxidases, bacterial laccases have a wide substrate range. There is interest in using bacterial laccases and DyP peroxidases for industry applications, biotechnology and bioremediation because of the greater ease of manipulation of bacterial genomes and gene expression compared to fungi. The wide range of substrates for these types of enzymes also increases the range of processes they may be used in. These processes include pulp processing, textile dye modification, decontamination of waste water and production of pharmaceutical building blocks. Furthermore, bacterial laccases function at higher temperatures, alkalinity, and salt concentrations than fungal laccases, making them more suitable for industrial use. Both intracellular and extracellular bacterial DyP-type peroxidases and laccases have been identified, suggesting that some are used as intracellular enzymes while others are secreted to degrade compounds in the environment. However, their roles in bacterial physiology and their natural physiological substrates have yet to be detailed.

Early life Gibson was born at Falkirk, Scotland, the third son of John Edward Gibson, metal manufacturer, and his wife Harriette, n√©e Hicks. Gibson was educated at Falkirk High School and joined the Camelon Iron Company, of which his father was managing director, at 15 years of age. In 1883 he was apprenticed to Robert Gardner and Company, Glasgow, and studied art and design at the Haldane academy. Career In 1887 Gibson rejoined the Camelon Iron Company as a designer, and was soon appointed manager of its London office. Gibson married Winifred Moore of Glasgow on 22 March 1890, and sailed to Australia the same day, following two brothers. He was a designer and draughtsman for about six years at Melbourne. In 1897, he established the Austral Manufacturing Company Pty Ltd. Some 10 years later he founded the Lux Foundry Pty Ltd, and held a controlling interest in these companies for the rest of his life. During World War I he did valuable work as a member of the coal board regarding the rationing of coal, gas and electric power. He was appointed one of the seven honorary commissioners to administer the repatriation act, and was deputy chairman until the appointment of the permanent commission in 1920. He was chairman of the royal commission on federal economics, and was a member of the Victorian State electricity commission from its inception. He had great confidence in the future value of the works at Yallourn. In 1924 he was appointed a member of the Commonwealth Bank board, was elected chairman in 1926, and was re-elected to that position each year. He was a director of the Union Trustee Company Ltd., the National Mutual Life Association, the Chamber of Manufactures Insurance Company Ltd., and Robert Harper and Company Ltd. and served as a representative of the Commonwealth government regarding Commonwealth Oil Refineries Ltd. When the Scullin government was endeavouring to grapple with the position, which was aggravated in Australia by the low prices being paid for wool and wheat, various currency devices were brought forward, and Gibson's firm attitude towards E. G. Theodore, the treasurer of the day, eventually made possible the adoption of the premiers' plan. There was some intriguing to displace Gibson from the Commonwealth bank board but these efforts were defeated. On 6 May 1931 he was called before the bar of the senate to give his views on the Commonwealth bank bill. He replied to the many questions asked fully and patiently and with such effect that it was said that the bill was dead before he left the chamber. An experienced reporter described it as the finest performance he had ever seen in parliament. Gibson, while disclaiming any intention that the Commonwealth bank should dictate to the government, was determined that no efforts should be spared to prevent inflation; in this he was successful. Late life and legacy Gibson had a serious illness in 1933 and died in South Yarra on 1 January 1934. Lady Gibson survived him with two sons and five daughters. He was created CBE in 1918, KBE in 1920 and GBE in 1932. References *C. B.

Etymology  The word \\"Narikurava\\" is a combination of the Tamil words \\"Nari\\" and \\"Kurava\\" meaning \\"jackal people\\"The Land Pirates of India, Pg 64 or the \\"fox people\\".Viramma, p 287 This appellation has been bestowed upon them due to their adeptness in hunting and trapping jackals.  Origins  As per a theory propounded by Werth in 1966 and Fraser, authorities on the gypsies of Europe, believes that the Domar are the ancestors of the Romani people and therefore, the Narikuravas are related to the Romani.Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples, p 265 while Edgar Thurston feels that they are related to the Khonds of Orissa.  Language  The Narikuravas speak the unclassified Indo-Aryan language called Vaagri Booli., Pg 48 Due to this reason, they are also known as Vagris or Vagrivalas.Conservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples, p 264 Almost all Narikuravas are well-versed in Tamil. However, most of the Narikurava liturgical hymns and folk songs are in Vagriboli.  Sub-divisions  A Narikorava shop selling beads Although all vagirivala or kuruvikarar come under one roof based on their common clan name nari-kuravars they were broadly sub-divided into two sub-divisions: theConservation and Mobile Indigenous Peoples, p 271 buffalo-sacrificers and Nandevala or goat-sacrificers. But they are Commonly classified based on the region they originate from. The Seliyos have only one sub-sect‚Äîthe Vithiyo.  Customs and practices  Each Narikurava clan has a bundle of clothes called sami-mootai meaning \\"God's bundle\\". It is filled with blood of animals sacrificed by the Narikuravas and clothes dipped in them. The sami-mootai of one clan must not be touched by members of another clan. On the death of the head of the family, his eldest son inherits the sami-mootai. The prestige a clan-leader holds depends on the antiquity of his sami-mootai.  Silambam  Silambam is a stick fighting style that supposedly originated from the Kurinji hills some 5000 years ago, where the native Narikuravar used bamboo staves called Silambamboo to defend themselves against wild animals.  Issues  The major issues which confront Narikuravas are poverty, illiteracy, diseases and discrimination. There has been discrimination of Narikuravas since ancient times. Due to their consumption of the Golden Jackal, which is forbidden by settled Hindu communities and other habits, they are considered untouchable and are excluded from streets inhabited by upper castes. This has led to protests and resentment from the community. However, the Narikuravas are yet to be recognized as a scheduled tribe. High crime rates and unemployment are other problems which afflict the Narikurava community. The proscription of fox-hunting as well as killing endangered species of birds and wildlife have depleted the Narikuravas of their traditional sources of livelihood. As a result, unemployed Narikurava youth are taking to crime and illegal activities. There have also been instances when Narikurava have been arrested for the possession of unregistered firearms as country rifles which are banned according to the Indian laws. On 1996, a social-welfare organization named Narikurava Seva Sangam was formed in order to educate Narikurava children and facilitate them to lead a settled life. Other social-welfare organizations, too, have poured in their efforts to improve the lives of the Narikuravas. In May 2008, the creation of a Welfare Board for the Narikuravas headed by the Backward Classes Minister was authorized by the State Government. Steady progress is being made in educating Narikuravas and assimilating them into society. The demand for the Welfare Board and remove them from the Backward Class list and include them into Scheduled Tribes.

He is mostly known for his poems depicting his own pathos. He lived in Lathi-Gohilwad, which is located in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat. Life Kalapi was born on 26 January 1874 to his father Maharaja Takhtasinhji, the ruler of Lathi, a small state situated in a far away corner of Saurashtra region, and mother Ramaba. Takhtasinhji died when Kalapi was 5, and Ramaba died when Kalapi was 14. These deaths left a permanent impact on Kalapi's mind. At the age of 8, Kalapi entered into Rajkumar College, Rajkot for school education, and spent next 9 years (1882 ‚Äì 1891) there, but didn't complete his schooling and dropped out of school. During these times, he studied extensively English, Sanskrit and contemporary Gujarati literature Kalapi's date of death is uncertain. It is formally noted down as 10 June 1900. There is also some controversy over his death. It was declared as death due to Cholera but some believed that it was not a natural death. =Personal life= Kalapi was married‚Äîat the age of 15‚Äîto two princesses. These were Rajba-Ramaba (born 1868), the princess of Kutch‚ÄìRoha; and Kesharba-Anandiba (Born 1872), the princess of Saurashtra‚ÄìKotada. When Kalapi was 20 years old, he fell in love with a family maid, Shobhana, who served his royal family. It is believed that Kalapi's love for Shobhana became a source of conflict with Rajba-Ramaba and the reason for his subsequent death due to poisoning by her. Works Handwriting of Kalapi (A letter written to Monghi (a.k.a. Shobhana) In spite of his short life, Kalapi's body of work was large. The poet penned about 250 poems, including about 15,000 verses. He also authored a number of prose writings and over 900 letters to his friends and wives. He not only used the Gujarati language as his medium to elaborate on his thoughts, but also translated four English novels to Gujarati. Kalapi mentored a number of budding poets who carried on his style of writing, many of whom become famous in their own right. The most prominent among these was Kavi Lalitji, who was about the same age as Kalapi, and was already an established poet when he was invited to the Lathi Darbar as a tutor for the royal children. He came under Kalapi's influence and the two became great friends. Lalitji went on to become the Rajya Kavi (Royal Bard) of Lathi. Kavi Kalapi had written poems in various Chhand (metres) of the Gujarati language. Like Mandakranta, Shardulvikridit, Shikharini and others, to write poems in Chhand, one has to follow the structure of that chhand and the rules of chhandas poetry. Aapni Yadi is one of his best known ghazal in the Gujarati literature.  Legacy  In his remembrance, the Indian National Theater at Mumbai, since 1997, gives the Kalapi Award to an accomplished Gujarati ghazal poet annually. =Museum= Kalpi Tirtha Museum The Kalpi Tirtha Museum holds objects related to the life of the Gujarati poet Kalpi. The museum was inaugurated in 2005. It is located at Lathi on the birthplace of Kalpi in the Amreli district of Gujarat. There is a huge collection of articles written by the artists themselves, letters, the rare items they used, and the history of the monarchy. The memorials were also associated with the Kalpi Tirtha, where the Kalpati lived, the palace, which was sitting on the banks of the lake. This place is a center of attraction for Gujarat's literature makers. There is a small auditorium on the upper floors of Kalpitirth Bhawan. Apart from Wednesdays, this museum gives free entry. Videography and photography are permitted. In popular culture The 1966 Gujarati film, Kalapi, is based on his life. Sanjeev Kumar plays the titular role, and Padmarani plays the role of his wife, Rama. The film was directed by Manhar Raskapur.

They are mainly found in areas with slow-moving waters, but some species have also been recorded from rapids. They are part of a group popularly known as eartheaters and feed by picking up mouthfuls of sand to sift out food items such as invertebrates, plant material and detritus (the only exception is mid-water feeding S. acuticeps). They often feed in small groups and one individual may act as a watchman, which will charge an approaching piranha with its mouth open and fins erected. The Satanoperca in the group take turn acting as watchman. Satanoperca are up to in standard length, but the smallest species reach less than that size. The species fall into two or three main groups: The S. daemon group (including S. lilith) are relatively large, and have a distinct dark spot on the tail and one or two dark spots on the side of the body. S. acuticeps is rather similar and variably placed in its own group or included in the S. daemon group, but it has three dark spots on the body and a differently shaped mouth. The remaining species are part of the S. jurupari group, which may have a small tail-spot and may have a poorly defined pattern of dark bands or blotches on the body, but always lack distinct dark spots on the body.

The uprising broke out in Svaneti, a highland western Georgian province, almost immediately after the Red Army invasion of Georgia and the establishment of the Georgian SSR (February-March 1921). The first disturbances among the local peasants appeared already in May 1921, and quickly developed into an armed revolt against the highly unpopular Revolutionary Committee of Georgia (Revkom), an acting Bolshevik government in the transitional period. The guerrilla detachments led by Mosostr Dadeshkeliani, Nestor Gardapkhadze and Bidzina Pirveli, disarmed the Svaneti-based Red Army units in September, and launched preparations for the march on Kutaisi, the second largest city of Georgia. The Georgian Revkom, which faced the distinct prospect of a nationwide insurrection and civil war,Knight, Amy W. (1993), Beria: Stalin's First Lieutenant, p. 26. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, ordered, on October 7, 1921, the formation of special punitive detachments to fight the insurgents who were denounced as \\"political bandits\\". On November 15, 1921, Soviet officials reported that the number of Svanetian rebels amounted to 1,600, and their actions were coordinated by the National- Democratic Party of Georgia, which maintained contacts with a Tbilisi-based Menshevik organization. ·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éî·É†·Éò ·Éë·Éî·Éú·Éò·É´·Éî (Valeri Benidze) (1991), 1924 ·É¨·Éö·Éò·É° ·Éê·ÉØ·Éê·Éú·Éß·Éî·Éë·Éê ·É°·Éê·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éù·É®·Éò (1924 Uprising in Georgia), p. 10.

By late December 1921, the fresh Red Army reinforcements finally crushed the revolt. The chief rebels were executed and severe repressive measures were established in the area. The defeat of the Svanetian rebellion forced major Georgian opposition parties to seek closer cooperation, which would later conclude with the generalization of an anti-Soviet uprising in August 1924.Jones, Stephen F.

It is part of the Zelve Open Air Museum, located between √úrg√ºp and Avanos, Turkey. Remains The remains of the Zelve monastery complex are located on the northern slopes of Aktepe, 1 km from Pa≈üa Baƒülari and 10 km out from G√∂reme on the Avanos road. Zelve does not have the rich frescoes of G√∂reme and other Cappadocian locations. Zelve is spread out over three valleys, of which two are connected by a tunnel. The complex contains innumerable rooms and passages which also house many pointed fairy chimneys with large stems, at about 40 feet above the valley floor. The valley was a monastic retreat between the 9th and 13th centuries. Christians moved to Zelve during the Persian and Arab invasions. The site was inhabited until 1952 when villagers were relocated to nearby Aktepe due to safety concerns. Cappadocia's first seminaries to train priests are located here at the monastery. Dating back to the early years of monastery life in Zelve is the Direkli Church (with the famed columns). Direkli is located at the bottom of the slope. The main decorations are iconoclastic-doctrine high relief crosses. The valley also contains the Balikli Kilise (Fish), √úz√ºml√º Kilise (Grapes) churches and the now totally collapsed Geyikli Kilise (Deer church). These churches date to the pre- iconoclastic period. The area was inhabited until 1952, when the last inhabitants moved to the new town Yeni Zelve (\\"New Zelve\\"), 2 km away. In 1967, Zelve was turned into an open-air museum. The area also contains houses, a tunnel joining two of the valleys, a mill (without sails), and a small mosque. Several dovecotes are found in the valley.
