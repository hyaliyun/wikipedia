Impact survival is a theory that life, usually in the form of microbial bacteria, can survive under the extreme conditions they are exposed to during a major impact event, such as a meteorite striking the surface of a planet.Melosh, H., 1989, Impact Cratering: A Geologic Process, Oxford Univ. Press, Oxford. This step is a necessity for the possibility of panspermia, for the microbial life must be able to survive both the escape out of the initial planetary atmosphere, likely due to a major impact, as well the reentry and collision with a second planetary body.  Dangers to life  For small organisms to leave a planet's orbit, escape velocity must be reached, which is dependent upon the mass of the planet. To reach these velocities, both the surviving organisms and the pieces of debris that they live on must withstand large amounts of acceleration and jerk.Burchell, M. Survival of bacteria and spores under extreme shock pressures. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 2004, p. 1277. One calculation has determined that for possible organisms to be launched out of an orbit of a planet the size of Mars, jerk would be nearly 6x109 m/s3.Mastrapa R., Glanzberg h., 2001, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 189,1 In addition to this, the velocity of incoming meteorites are projected to be in the range of 20 to 25 km/s.Hughes, D. W., and I. P. Williams 2000. The velocity distributions of periodic comets and stream meteoroids. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.315, 629‚Äì634 Thus any organisms that could survive a major impact event and be sent to outer space must be very small, light, and able to withstand large amounts of acceleration and jerk. While concerns over the heat of ejected rocks and the possible sterilizing affects it would have on the microbial life attached, it has been theorized that for rocks even less than 2 kilograms such as ALH84001, internal parts may never reach temperatures greater than 40 ¬∞C.Weiss, B.

Recent experiments have found organisms that can survive both the acceleration and jerk involved in reaching escape velocity. A major impact event was simulated using an air cannon to propel both ice and agar projectiles covered with chosen microorganisms to extreme speeds and then crashing the projectiles into a solid surface. Two species of bacteria were tested - R. erythropolis and B. subtilis - and while survival rates were low, at 100 GPa of peak pressure there was still a survival rate of 3.9x10‚àí5 in the B. subtilis. These findings have been replicated with other bacteria as well - D. radioduransMastrapa, R. M. E., H. Glanzberg, J. N. Head, H. J. Melosh, and W. L. Nicholson 2000.

Also, experimental methods have been varied, and survival rates have also been found when bacteria are subjected to acceleration at an extended time, through the use of a centrifuge as well as when shot into liquid water.D.J.

It is a fighting game where players choose between the film's Jaegers and Kaiju. It was delisted from both digital stores in 2016. Gameplay In single-player mode, the player engages in several one-on-one melee battles to earn achievement points and upgrades for their characters. Jaegers have two health bars (as they require two pilots) while Kaijus have one. Each character has its own set of special attacks. For example, Gipsy Danger can fire its plasma cannon or use its chain swords, while Leatherback can disrupt a Jaeger's mobility by firing an electromagnetic pulse. Divulgation The game was first announced by the Australian Classification Board. A NeoGAF user posted several screenshots from the game, showing the monsters and robots of the movie battling in a number of environments. On July 7, 2013, a teaser trailer was released. Reception The game was met with mixed to negative reviews. It has a Metacritic score of 39 out of 100, based on 14 reviews. Jake Magee of IGN gave it a mediocre rating of 5.3, calling it \\"a flimsy movie tie-in that chooses to concentrate on repetitive and nonsensical story missions.\\" Ben Rayner of Xboxer360 gave it a score of 60 out of 100, calling it \\"a 'freemium' game disguised as an XBLA game.\\" Pacific Rim: The Mobile Game Pacific Rim: The Mobile Game is a 2013 video game developed by Reliance Games and Behaviour Interactive for iOS and Android smartphone platforms. According to Reliance Games' chief executive Manish Agarwal, the game is set before the events of the film, and the company worked extensively with director Guillermo Del Toro in the game's design and testing. Gameplay During battle, the player uses the on-screen buttons to block or dodge a Kaiju attack. Once the Kaiju gives an opening, the player swipes the screen to execute an attack. The campaign spans 30 missions, with the player earning cash to upgrade their Jaeger by changing parts or buying single-use power-ups. Cash can also be collected to buy more powerful Jaegers. Reception Much like its console counterpart, Pacific Rim: The Mobile Game did not fare well with critics. The iOS version has a Metacritic score of 48 out of 100, based on 12 reviews. Mike Fahey of Kotaku criticized the game for its lack of innovation, saying it \\"isn't a bad Infinity Blade-style mobile game. It's just another one.\\" Scott Nichols of Digital Spy gave the game two out of five stars, commenting that it is \\"priced at a premium, making the free-to-play structure rather insulting to fans.\\" See also * List of Kaiju related games References Category:2013 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Behaviour Interactive games Category:IOS games Category:Video games about mecha Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Warner Bros.

It was established in 1834 by Maria Christina Lindstr√∂m (1806‚Äì1895) on the intersection of Jakobsgatan and Drottninggatan. The original Tysta Mari was closed in 1954, but a new coffee shop and restaurant with the same names was opened in 1974 on √ñstermalm. Overview It got its name Tysta Mari (literary: \\"Silent Mary\\") as a description the founder Maria Christina Lindstr√∂m's unobtrusive and discrete way of doing business and serving, and after this name became common, she made the nickname the cafe's official name. In 1934, Tysta Mari moved to a location on Tegelbacken. Maria Christina Lindstr√∂m retired in 1857 and the business was continued by first her cousin Elise Granberg and in 1879 by the sisters Amalia and Mina Damberg.Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entrepren√∂rskap: under 400 √•r, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013 The Tysta Mari finally closed its doors in 1954, when the locale Tegelbacken was demolished for renovations and building of a more modern edifice. Tysta Mari was famous in 19th-century Stockholm and came to be the common used name for a certain category of coffee shops, often managed by women, where no alcohol was served, no gaming and betting was allowed, and which therefore became socially acceptable for a clientele of upperclass women.Du Rietz, Anita, Kvinnors entrepren√∂rskap: under 400 √•r, 1. uppl., Dialogos, Stockholm, 2013 This was noted in the a book about Stockholm, Nya Stockholm ('New Stockholm') by Cla√´s Lundin in 1890, who described the name in this capacity in his description of the contemporary restaurant-life in Stockholm: :\\"Tysta Mari-coffee shops: common name for a coffee shop with a good range, solid service and quiet and decent customers.

The trunk is usually rough, and the small branchlets and twigs are puberulous (densely covered with very short soft hairs) when young. The leaves are bi-pinnate and up to long, each leaf having four to seven pairs of pinnae, and each pinna having six to nineteen pairs of leaflets. There is usually a gland between each pair of pinnae. The leaflets are linear or oblong and up to long, with the underside often having raised lateral nerves. The inflorescence is a spike up to long composed of whitish or creamy flowers, which are followed by flattened pods up to long. Distribution and habitat This tree is found in eastern Africa, its range extending from Kenya and Tanzania, through Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia, to Mozambique, Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Generally a tree of riverside forests, it also grows in sandy areas with a high water table, at altitudes of up to about ; these include the Southern African Sand Forest. Uses The timber of Newtonia hildebrandtii is used for building construction and for making poles and implements, and for carving. The wood burns well and makes good-quality charcoal. Products from the tree are also used in traditional medicine; an extract of the roots is used against worms, and an extract from the bark has been shown to have antimicrobial activity against a range of pathogens.

It took place south of Kilworth and north of Fermoy between the river Funcheon and the river Blackwater in County Cork on 4 June 1643. The result was an Irish Confederate victory.  Royalist Movements  At the beginning of May 1643, Murrough O‚ÄôBrien (Baron Inchiquin), governor of Munster on behalf of King Charles I \\"drew his forces out of the garrifons, where they were on the point of ftarving.\\". He divided his forces into three parts in order to gather provisions by pillaging. One army under Lieutenant Colonel Story was sent into Kerry; Inchiquin himself went to besiege Kilmallock; while the 3rd army under the command of Sir Charles Vavasour \\"respectively gathered from the Garrisons of Youghall, Talloe, Castlelyons, Mogily and Cappaquin; the whole number consisting of about 1200 Musketeers, and 200 Horse, besides Volunteers and Pillagers\\". and marched into county Waterford. This army marched as far as Dungarvan capturing and burning castles and houses and taking cattle. By 3 June they were back in county Cork and attacked the castle of Cloghleagh. Cloghleagh castle had been the ancestral home of the Condons who had retaken it in 1642 from forces placed there by the Earl of Barrymore. The Condon reinstatement was to be a short one as Vavasour‚Äôs army arrived and \\"after a well regulated dispute (stoutly defended by the rebels)\\" took it back. The occupants, 20 men, 11 women, and 7 children, were stripped and massacred (against the wishes of Colonel Vavasour who had left the castle to attend a dinner invitation at the house of a Mr. Roche in Castlelyons). On the morning of 4 June Captain Hill of the Royalist force was sent to scout into county Tipperary with a squadron of horse and encountered the enemy. Having escaped with great difficulty, Captain Hill returned to Cloghleagh pursued by a force of Confederate cavalry who stopped on a hill overlooking Cloghleagh. Sir Charles Vavasour was sent for and he came back to Cloghleagh as \\"fast as his horse would carry him\\". After consulting with his officers he decided that the appearance of the enemy cavalry meant that a larger enemy force was approaching and that the best course of action was to retreat southwards from Cloghleagh castle by crossing the river Funcheon and then crossing the river Blackwater at the ford of Fermoy and moving towards Castlelyons. The army was formed up to march with \\"the front led by lieutenant King, the body by major Howel and the rear by Sir Charles himself, a forlorn-hope of about 160 musketeers in the rear was commanded by Captain Pierce Lacy, Captain Hutton, and lieutenant Stardbury and all our horse in the rear likewise.\\" Cloghleigh Castle, Fermoy, County Cork  Confederate Movements  James Tuchet (Earl of Castlehaven) was commanded by the assembly of Irish Confederates to march south from Kilkenny and confront the Royalist armies in Munster. He gathered about 80 horse in Kilkenny and placed them under the command of Garret Talbot to which he joined his own lifeguard of 40 horse which was commanded by Garret Garrough Fitzgerald and marched together with his \\"great friend\\" Donagh MacCarthy (Viscount Muskery) and on the frontiers of Munster linked with \\"120 horse more, most of them gentlemen\\". At Cashel they met with General Barry, Lieutenant General Purcell and 700 foot. At Cashel they received intelligence that Inchiquin had abandoned the siege of Kilmallock and moved into Kerry but that Vavasour was at Cloghleagh with \\"16 or 1700 horse and foot\\" whereupon \\"I marched immediately towards him, and before night encamped within 3 miles of him\\". Casltehaven‚Äôs brother in law, Richard Butler of Kilcash was sent out to scout and on the morning of 4 June he sent word that he was engaged with the enemy upon which Castlehaven \\"lost no time but marched with all haste with my horse‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..The foot marched after, but the old general moved so slowly, that I had defeated the enemy before he came within two miles of the place\\".

The film premiered in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival where Guiraudie won the award for Best Director. The film also won the Queer Palm award, and was mentioned on multiple top ten lists of the best films of 2014. Plot Franck (Pierre Deladonchamps) is a regular visitor to a nude beach and the woods surrounding it, both of which are a popular cruising destination for gay men. He befriends Henri (Patrick d'Assum√ßao), an older man who seeks solitude at the beach after breaking up with his girlfriend, and Michel (Christophe Paou), a handsome man to whom Franck is instantly attracted. One evening, Franck observes Michel drowning another man in the lake. Though terrified by what he has seen, Franck is unable to resist his attraction to Michel, and continues to pursue him. When the body of the drowned man is discovered and identified, a police investigator begins to question the men at the beach; Franck tells the investigator that he did not see anything unusual on the evening the man drowned. Franck and Michel's relationship progresses, though Franck becomes increasingly frustrated by Michel's refusal to meet him anywhere other than at the beach. Henri, who has correctly intuited the events that have occurred over the past several days, warns Franck about Michel. When Franck goes swimming, Henri confronts Michel, and tells him that he knows he is the murderer. Henri leaves to take a walk in the woods, casting a glance back at Michel as he departs. When Franck returns, he discovers that the beach is suddenly deserted. He enters the woods, where he sees Michel walking away from a patch of tall grass. Upon entering the grass, he finds Henri, whose throat has been slit. Henri tells him that he got what he wanted. Franck, now being pursued by Michel, runs into the woods to hide. He sees Michel run into the inspector, whom he hits violently and stabs in the stomach with a knife. Night falls, and Franck remains in hiding. Michel calls out to Franck, saying that he needs his love and wants to spend the night with him. Franck does not respond, and Michel walks away to search for him deeper in the woods. After a time, Franck stands up from his hiding place, and calls out Michel's name repeatedly.

Czech Republic  On November 2008, Hyundai opened its European plant in No≈°ovice, Czech Republic, following an investment of over 1 billion euros and over two years of construction. The plant, which mainly manufactures the i30, ix20, ix35 for the European market, has an annual capacity of 300,000 cars. The new Hyundai plant is 90 kilometres north of Kia Motors' ≈Ωilina Plant in Slovakia.  Germany  Hyundai has been operating an R&D; centre in Frankfurt, Germany since 1994, that has been responsible for monitoring technology developments in Europe and designing and engineering new cars for the European market. In September 2003, the company opened its new European headquarters in R√ºsselsheim, after an investment worth 50 million euro. The site became the new location for the R&D; centre and for the world rally team of the company.  Russia  In Russia, the production of the Hyundai Accent, Sonata, Elantra and Santa Fe models has been taking place at the TagAZ plant, located in Taganrog, since 2001, in the form of complete knock-down kits assembly. Since 2006, the factory has also been assembling the Hyundai Porter, County, Aero Town and the HD 500 commercial vehicles. In June 2008, Hyundai started the construction of a new manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg with a planned yearly capacity of 100,000 cars, that will eventually be increased to 200,000 units. It started mass production in January 2011, with two models: the Hyundai Solaris and the Kia Rio. History in Europe Hyundai first imported passenger cars to Europe in 1978 with the launch of its Pony on several left-hand drive markets, with the right-hand drive version launching the brand on the British market in 1982.By 1984, Hyundai had launched a second model on the European market ‚Äì the Stellar, a large rear-wheel drive family saloon based loosely on the Ford Cortina chassis.It was even advertised on the UK market as the spiritual successor to the Cortina.By 1990, with sales steadily rising across the continent, Hyundai was now a four-model brand in Europe, having launched the flagship Sonata saloon and Scoupe sports model onto the European market. The 1980s Hyundai models were duly replaced during the 1990s, with the 1996 Hyundai Coupe being well-received by the European motoring press. Growing demand for MPVs and SUVs by the turn of the 21st century saw Hyundai venture into these new or expanding market sectors. By 2018, it was importing nine passenger vehicle ranges (some with two or more bodystyles) and two commercial vehicles ranges in Europe. Hyundai has been particularly successful on the UK market since launching there in 1982. Its millionth UK market model was sold in 2015.Sales peaked at more than 93,000 units in 2017.

Early life Graham was born on 29 July 1742 in Lanarkshire, Scotland. She was the only daughter of Janet (n√©e Hamilton) and John Marshall, a landowner. She grew up on an estate at Elderslie, near Paisley. With money from a legacy left by her grandfather she attended the boarding school of Betty Morehead for seven years. The Graham family was known for their piety and Isabella became a communicant of the Church of Scotland at the age of seventeen at the Laigh Kirk, Paisley where Dr. John Witherspoon, who was later a signatory to the United States Declaration of Independence, was the minister . Personal life In 1765, she married Dr. John Graham, an army surgeon in the Royal Americans regiment. Two years later, she went with him to Canada. They had three daughters and two sons, one of whom died in infancy in Scotland. The surviving children were Jessie, Joanna Bethune, Isabella and John. Her husband was ordered to Antigua and she traveled there with him, her children, and two indigenous girls. On 17 November 1774 John Graham became ill with fever and died on 22 November 1774. She would never remarry and would from then on wear the clothes of a widow. Pregnant with her fifth child at the time of her husband's death, she chose to return to Scotland with her children. After the birth of her son, Graham struggled to provide for her children as well as her elderly father. As a way to care for her family, she opened a small school in Paisley and later a boarding school for young ladies in Edinburgh. While visiting Scotland from America in 1785, Dr. John Witherspoon spoke with Isabella regarding returning to the United States. After her children had completed their schooling, she departed for New York in July 1789 to help prepare the United States for its role as \\"the country where the Church of Christ would eventually flourish\\" and later that year established a school for young women. While living in America, Graham was a member of the New York Society Library along with many of the nation's founding fathers and other influential individuals of the time. She is the only woman who is listed under members with a political occupation within the site's database. Although her borrowing history at the library spans only four months, Graham checked out thirteen books during that period. The records of her borrowing history demonstrate her interests in historical and biographical works, as well as novels and travel diaries.City Readers: Digital Historic Collections at the New York Society Library Philanthropy and Establishments Earlier in her life in Scotland, Graham founded the Penny Society, later known as the Society for the Relief of the Destitute Sick, a friendly society for poor members, who contributed a penny a week to create a fund for providing for them when sick. This organization was the beginning of a life dedicated to philanthropy. Graham established the Society for the Relief of Poor Widows in 1797. The Society for Relief of Poor Widows with Small Children was one of the first women's societies to engage in active public benevolence and successfully petitioned for shares of public welfare funds. She retired from teaching in 1798 to devote herself completely to philanthropic work. Throughout her life, Graham also founded, or helped organize, the Orphan Asylum Society (organized 1806), the Society for Promoting Industry among the Poor, and the first Sunday School for Ignorant Adults in New York. She also aided in organizing the first missionary society and the first monthly missionary prayer meeting in the city; was the first president of the Magdalen Society of New-York (founded 1812); systematically visited the inmates of the hospital, and the sick female convicts in the state prison; and distributed Bibles to hundreds of families, as well as tracts prepared under her own direction. She believed that cultivating piety and Christian morality was the key to lifting widows out of poverty.

Located inside the 610 Loop and just west of the Houston Heights, Lazybrook and Timbergrove Manor are situated along the wooded banks of White Oak Bayou in the near northwest quadrant of the city.  History  Originally settled by German farmers in the late 1800s, the area was the site of a major oil discovery in the 1930s known as \\"Eureka.\\" Reminders of that distant past remain in a nearby railroad yard, still called the Eureka Yard, and one of the original churches, built by early settlers in 1891, St. John's German Lutheran Church, that still exists, although it now resides in Downtown's Sam Houston Park.Heritage Texas Properties Neighborhood Profile, additional text. In the pre-freeway period after World War II, this area remained largely wooded and undeveloped while suburban growth was exploding in every other direction of Houston. However, by the 1950s, residential development finally emerged in the area beginning with Timbergrove Manor, followed by Lazybrook. Timbergrove Manor was named for the many pine trees sheltering the area, while Lazybrook was named for White Oak Bayou, which forms the neighborhood's eastern boundary. In 2011 the Lazybrook/Timbergrove Super Neighborhood was formed.  Cityscape  Today, the community primarily consists of mid-century, one-story ranch style brick homes. Lazybrook/Timbergrove is enjoying a renaissance as demand increases for close-in housing in Houston. Residents have seen a transition as original- owner, retired neighbors have moved out and young professionals have moved in. Besides the anchor communities of Lazybrook and Timbergrove Manor, upscale townhome developments such as Heritage Creek, Timbergrove Heights, Timbergrove Terrace, Timbergrove Point, and Timbergrove Gardens are within the larger neighborhood. The northwestern corner Lazybrook/Timbergrove extending outside of Loop 610 on both sides of US 290, includes Brookwood, a large lot subdivision, the Brookhollow business park, Northwest Mall and Houston Independent School District's (HISD) headquarters and Delmar Stadium complex.  Government  Lazybrook/Timbergrove is located in the city limits of Houston and Houston City Council District C. In October 2011, the Houston City Council officially recognized the Lazybrook/Timbergrove Super Neighborhood Council. Timbergrove Manor is divided into two distinct subdivisions, each governed by a separate homeowners association - the Timbergrove Manor Civic Club and the Timbergrove Manor Neighborhood Association. Together with the Lazybrook Civic Club, these active associations were instrumental in the city of Houston's designation of the Lazybrook/Timbergrove Super Neighborhood. Deed restrictions are enforced throughout, and the groups handle landscaping of esplanades and a Citizens on Patrol security plan.  Education  Sinclair Elementary School Lazybrook/Timbergrove is served by Houston Independent School District. The neighborhood elementary school is Sinclair Elementary, although portion of Timbergrove Manor are zoned to Love Elementary in the Houston Heights. Sinclair Elementary was named after Thomas Albert Sinclair, founder of the Heights Hospital. Middle schools that serve Lazybrook/Timbergrove are Frank Black Middle School and Hamilton Middle School. Most area students are zoned to Waltrip High School in the Oak Forest neighborhood, with a small portion of Timbergrove Manor students zoned to Reagan High School in the Houston Heights.  Parks and Recreation  Jaycee Park The City of Houston operates parks within and around the Lazybrook/Timbergrove. Parks in the area include: * West 11th Street Park * Timbergrove Manor Park * Jaycee Park * T.C. Jester Parkway The West White Oak Bayou Trail begins in Timbergrove Manor and runs along the banks of the bayou, parallel to T. C. Jester Boulevard, from 11th Street, through Lazybrook and Oak Forest. The White Oak Bayou Trail provides bicyclists and pedestrians a 7.4-mile (11.9 km) long mostly concrete and asphalt trail. Passing through several parks, the trail is lighted and includes protective railings in some areas.

To take the metric and affine connection as independent variables in the action principle was first considered by Palatini.A. Palatini (1919) Deduzione invariantiva delle equazioni gravitazionali dal principio di Hamilton, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 43, 203-212 [English translation by R.Hojman and C. Mukku in P.G. Bergmann and V. De Sabbata (eds.) Cosmology and Gravitation, Plenum Press, New York (1980)] It is called a first order formulation as the variables to vary over involve only up to first derivatives in the action and so doesn't overcomplicate the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations with terms coming from higher derivative terms. The tetradic Palatini action is another first-order formulation of the Einstein‚ÄìHilbert action in terms of a different pair of independent variables, known as frame fields and the spin connection. The use of frame fields and spin connections are essential in the formulation of a generally covariant fermionic action (see the article spin connection for more discussion of this) which couples fermions to gravity when added to the tetradic Palatini action. Not only is this needed to couple fermions to gravity and makes the tetradic action somehow more fundamental to the metric version, the Palatini action is also a stepping stone to more interesting actions like the self-dual Palatini action which can be seen as the Lagrangian basis for Ashtekar's formulation of canonical gravity (see Ashtekar's variables) or the Holst action which is the basis of the real variables version of Ashtekar's theory. Another important action is the Plebanski action (see the entry on the Barrett‚ÄìCrane model), and proving that it gives general relativity under certain conditions involves showing it reduces to the Palatini action under these conditions. Here we present definitions and calculate Einstein's equations from the Palatini action in detail. These calculations can be easily modified for the self-dual Palatini action and the Holst action.  Some definitions  We first need to introduce the notion of tetrads. A tetrad is an orthonormal vector basis in terms of which the space-time metric looks locally flat, :g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = e_\\\\alpha^I e_\\\\beta^J \\\\eta_{IJ} where \\\\eta_{IJ} = \\\\text{diag}(-1,1,1,1) is the Minkowski metric. The tetrads encode the information about the space-time metric and will be taken as one of the independent variables in the action principle. Now if one is going to operate on objects that have internal indices one needs to introduce an appropriate derivative (covariant derivative). We introduce an arbitrary covariant derivative via :\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha V_I = \\\\partial_\\\\alpha V_I + {\\\\omega_{\\\\alpha I}}^J V_J. Where {\\\\omega_{\\\\alpha I}}^J is a Lorentz connection (the derivative annihilates the Minkowski metric \\\\eta_{IJ}). We define a curvature via :{\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J V_J = (\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\beta - \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\beta\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha) V_I We obtain :{\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} = 2 \\\\partial_{[\\\\alpha} {\\\\omega_{\\\\beta]}}^{IJ} + 2{\\\\omega_{[\\\\alpha}}^{IK} {\\\\omega_{\\\\beta] K}}^J. We introduce the covariant derivative which annihilates the tetrad, : abla_\\\\alpha e_\\\\beta^I = 0. The connection is completely determined by the tetrad. The action of this on the generalized tensor V_\\\\beta^I is given by : abla_\\\\alpha V_\\\\beta^I = \\\\partial_\\\\alpha V_\\\\beta^I - \\\\Gamma_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^\\\\gamma V_\\\\gamma^I + {\\\\omega_{\\\\alpha J}}^I V_\\\\beta^J. We define a curvature {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} by :{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J V_J = ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha) V_I. This is easily related to the usual curvature defined by :{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} V_\\\\delta = ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha) V_\\\\gamma via substituting V_\\\\gamma = V_I e^I_\\\\gamma into this expression (see below for details). One obtains, :{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} = e_\\\\gamma^I {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J e_J^\\\\delta, \\\\quad R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma I}}^J e^I_\\\\beta e^\\\\gamma_J, R = {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} e_I^\\\\alpha e_J^\\\\beta for the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar respectively.  The tetradic Palatini action  The Ricci scalar of this curvature can be expressed as e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_J {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ}. The action can be written :S_{H-P} = \\\\int d^4 x \\\\; e \\\\; e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_J {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} where e = \\\\sqrt{-g} but now g is a function of the frame field. We will derive the Einstein equations by varying this action with respect to the tetrad and spin connection as independent quantities. As a shortcut to performing the calculation we introduce a connection compatible with the tetrad, abla_\\\\alpha e^I_\\\\beta = 0.A. Ashtekar \\"Lectures on non-perturbative canonical gravity\\" (with invited contributions), Bibliopolis, Naples 19988. The connection associated with this covariant derivative is completely determined by the tetrad. The difference between the two connections we have introduced is a field {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J defined by :{C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J V_J = \\\\left (D_\\\\alpha - abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_I. We can compute the difference between the curvatures of these two covariant derivatives (see below for details), :{\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ}-{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} = abla_{[\\\\alpha} {C_{\\\\beta]}}^{IJ} + {C_{[\\\\alpha}}^{IM} {C_{\\\\beta]M}}^J The reason for this intermediate calculation is that it is easier to compute the variation by reexpressing the action in terms of abla and {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} and noting that the variation with respect to {\\\\omega_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} is the same as the variation with respect to {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} (when keeping the tetrad fixed). The action becomes :S_{H-P} = \\\\int d^4x \\\\; e \\\\; e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_J \\\\left ({R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} + abla_{[\\\\alpha} {C_{\\\\beta]}}^{IJ} + {C_{[\\\\alpha}}^{IM} {C_{\\\\beta]M}}^J \\\\right ) We first vary with respect to {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ}. The first term does not depend on {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} so it does not contribute. The second term is a total derivative. The last term yields :e^{[a}_M e^{b]}_N \\\\delta^M_{[I} \\\\delta^K_{J]} {C_{bK}}^N = 0. We show below that this implies that {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} = 0 as the prefactor e^{[a}_M e^{b]}_N \\\\delta^M_{[I} \\\\delta^K_{J]} is non-degenerate. This tells us that abla coincides with D when acting on objects with only internal indices. Thus the connection D is completely determined by the tetrad and \\\\Omega coincides with R. To compute the variation with respect to the tetrad we need the variation of e = \\\\det e_\\\\alpha^I. From the standard formula :\\\\delta \\\\det (a) = \\\\det (a) \\\\left (a^{-1} \\\\right )_{ji} \\\\delta a_{ij} we have \\\\delta e = e e_I^\\\\alpha \\\\delta e_\\\\alpha^I. Or upon using \\\\delta \\\\left (e_\\\\alpha^I e_I^\\\\alpha \\\\right ) = 0, this becomes \\\\delta e = -e e_\\\\alpha^I \\\\delta e_I^\\\\alpha. We compute the second equation by varying with respect to the tetrad, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\delta S_{H-P} &= \\\\int d^4 x \\\\; e \\\\left ( \\\\left (\\\\delta e^\\\\alpha_I \\\\right ) e^\\\\beta_J {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} + e^\\\\alpha_I \\\\left (\\\\delta e^\\\\beta_J \\\\right ) {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} - e_\\\\gamma^K \\\\left ( \\\\delta e_K^\\\\gamma \\\\right ) e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_J {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 2 \\\\int d^4 x \\\\; e \\\\left ( e^\\\\beta_J {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} - {1 \\\\over 2} e_M^\\\\gamma e_N^\\\\delta e_\\\\alpha^I {\\\\Omega_{\\\\gamma \\\\delta}}^{MN} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\delta e_I^\\\\alpha \\\\right ) \\\\end{align} One gets, after substituting {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} for {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} as given by the previous equation of motion, :e_J^\\\\gamma {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma}}^{IJ} - {1 \\\\over 2} {R_{\\\\gamma \\\\delta}}^{MN} e_M^\\\\gamma e_N^\\\\delta e_\\\\alpha^I = 0 which, after multiplication by e_{I \\\\beta} just tells us that the Einstein tensor R_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}-\\\\tfrac{1}{2} R g_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} of the metric defined by the tetrads vanishes. We have therefore proved that the Palatini variation of the action in tetradic form yields the usual Einstein equations.  Generalizations of the Palatini action  We change the action by adding a term :\\\\- {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\gamma} e e_I^\\\\alpha e_J^\\\\beta {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{MN} [\\\\omega] {\\\\epsilon^{IJ}}_{MN} This modifies the Palatini action to :S = \\\\int d^4 x \\\\; e \\\\; e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_J {P^{IJ}}_{MN} {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{MN} where :{P^{IJ}}_{MN} = \\\\delta_M^{[I} \\\\delta_N^{J]} - {1 \\\\over 2 \\\\gamma} {\\\\epsilon^{IJ}}_{MN}. This action given above is the Holst action, introduced by Holst and \\\\gamma is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter whose role was recognized by Barbero and Immirizi. The self dual formulation corresponds to the choice \\\\gamma = -i. It is easy to show these actions give the same equations. However, the case corresponding to \\\\gamma = \\\\pm i must be done separately (see article self-dual Palatini action). Assume \\\\gamma ot= \\\\pm i, then {P^{IJ}}_{MN} has an inverse given by :{(P^{-1})_{IJ}}^{MN} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2}{\\\\gamma^2+1} \\\\left ( \\\\delta_I^{[M} \\\\delta_J^{N]} + \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\gamma} {\\\\epsilon_{IJ}}^{MN} \\\\right). (note this diverges for \\\\gamma = \\\\pm i). As this inverse exists the generalization of the prefactor e^{[a}_M e^{b]}_N \\\\delta^M_{[I} \\\\delta^K_{J]} will also be non-degenerate and as such equivalent conditions are obtained from variation with respect to the connection. We again obtain {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ} = 0. While variation with respect to the tetrad yields Einstein's equation plus an additional term. However, this extra term vanishes by symmetries of the Riemann tensor.  Details of calculation   Relating usual curvature to the mixed index curvature  The usual Riemann curvature tensor {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} is defined by :{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} V_\\\\delta = \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_\\\\gamma. To find the relation to the mixed index curvature tensor let us substitute V_\\\\gamma = e_\\\\gamma^I V_I :\\\\begin{align} {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} V_\\\\delta &= \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_\\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) \\\\left (e_\\\\gamma^I V_I \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e_\\\\gamma^I \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_I \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e_\\\\gamma^I {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J e_J^\\\\delta V_\\\\delta \\\\end{align} where we have used abla_\\\\alpha e_\\\\beta^I = 0. Since this is true for all V_\\\\delta we obtain :{R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\delta} = e_\\\\gamma^I {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J e_J^\\\\delta. Using this expression we find :R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} = {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma \\\\beta}}^{\\\\gamma} = {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma I}}^J e_\\\\beta^I e_J^\\\\gamma. Contracting over \\\\alpha and \\\\beta allows us write the Ricci scalar :R = {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{IJ} e_I^\\\\alpha e_J^\\\\beta.  Difference between curvatures  The derivative defined by D_\\\\alpha V_I only knows how to act on internal indices. However, we find it convenient to consider a torsion-free extension to spacetime indices. All calculations will be independent of this choice of extension. Applying \\\\mathcal{D}_a twice on V_I, :\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\beta V_I = \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha ( abla_\\\\beta V_I + {C_{\\\\beta I}}^J V_J) = abla_\\\\alpha \\\\left ( abla_\\\\beta V_I + {C_{\\\\beta I}}^J V_J \\\\right ) + {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^K \\\\left ( abla_b V_K + {C_{\\\\beta K}}^J V_J \\\\right ) + \\\\overline{\\\\Gamma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^\\\\gamma \\\\left ( abla_\\\\gamma V_I + {C_{\\\\gamma I}}^J V_J \\\\right ) where \\\\overline{\\\\Gamma}_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}^\\\\gamma is unimportant, we need only note that it is symmetric in \\\\alpha and \\\\beta as it is torsion-free. Then :\\\\begin{align} {\\\\Omega_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J V_J &= \\\\left (\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\beta - \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\beta \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_I \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha abla_\\\\beta - abla_\\\\beta abla_\\\\alpha \\\\right ) V_I + abla_\\\\alpha \\\\left ({C_{\\\\beta I}}^J V_J \\\\right ) - abla_\\\\beta \\\\left ({C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J V_J \\\\right ) +{C_{\\\\alpha I}}^K abla_\\\\beta V_K - {C_{\\\\beta I}}^K abla_\\\\alpha V_K + {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^K {C_{\\\\beta K}}^J V_J - {C_{\\\\beta I}}^K {C_{\\\\alpha K}}^J V_J \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {R_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta I}}^J V_J + \\\\left ( abla_\\\\alpha {C_{\\\\beta I}}^J - abla_\\\\beta {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J + {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^K {C_{\\\\beta K}}^J - {C_{\\\\beta_I}}^K {C_{\\\\alpha K}}^J \\\\right ) V_J \\\\end{align} Hence: :{\\\\Omega_{ab}}^{IJ} - {R_{ab}}^{IJ} = 2 abla_{[a} {C_{b]}}^{IJ} + 2{C_{[a}}^{IK} {C_{b] K}}^J  Varying the action with respect to the field {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ}  We would expect abla_a to also annihilate the Minkowski metric \\\\eta_{IJ} = e_{\\\\beta I} e^\\\\beta_J. If we also assume that the covariant derivative \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha annihilates the Minkowski metric (then said to be torsion- free) we have, :0 = (\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\alpha - abla_\\\\alpha) \\\\eta_{IJ}= {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^K \\\\eta_{KJ} + {C_{aJ}}^K \\\\eta_{IK} = C_{\\\\alpha IJ} + C_{\\\\alpha JI}.

This can be written more compactly as :e^{[\\\\alpha}_M e^{\\\\beta]}_N \\\\delta^M_{[I} \\\\delta^K_{J]} {C_{\\\\beta K}}^N = 0.  Vanishing of {C_\\\\alpha}^{IJ}  We will show following the reference \\"Geometrodynamics vs. Connection Dynamics\\" that :{C_{\\\\beta I}}^K e^{[\\\\alpha}_K e^{\\\\beta]}_J + {C_{\\\\beta J}}^K e^{[\\\\alpha}_I e^{\\\\beta]}_K = 0 \\\\quad Eq. 1 implies {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J = 0. First we define the spacetime tensor field by :S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} := C_{\\\\alpha IJ} e^I_\\\\beta e^J_\\\\gamma. Then the condition C_{\\\\alpha IJ} = C_{\\\\alpha [IJ]} is equivalent to S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} = S_{\\\\alpha [\\\\beta \\\\gamma]}. Contracting Eq. 1 with e_\\\\alpha^I e_\\\\gamma^J one calculates that :{C_{\\\\beta J}}^I e_\\\\gamma^J e_I^\\\\beta = 0. As {S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}}^{\\\\gamma} = {C_{\\\\alpha I}}^J e_\\\\beta^I e_J^\\\\gamma, we have {S_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma}}^{\\\\beta} = 0. We write it as :({C_{\\\\beta I}}^J e_J^\\\\beta) e_\\\\gamma^I = 0, and as e_\\\\alpha^I are invertible this implies :{C_{\\\\beta I}}^J e_J^\\\\beta = 0. Thus the terms {C_{\\\\beta I}}^K e^\\\\beta_K e^\\\\alpha_J, and {C_{\\\\beta J}}^K e^\\\\alpha_I e^\\\\beta_K of Eq. 1 both vanish and Eq. 1 reduces to :{C_{\\\\beta I}}^K e^\\\\alpha_K e^\\\\beta_J - {C_{\\\\beta J}}^K e^\\\\beta_I e^\\\\alpha_K = 0. If we now contract this with e^I_\\\\gamma e^J_\\\\delta, we get :\\\\begin{align} 0 &= \\\\left ( {C_{\\\\beta I}}^K e^\\\\alpha_K e^\\\\beta_J - {C_{\\\\beta J}}^K e^\\\\beta_I e^\\\\alpha_K \\\\right ) e^I_\\\\gamma e^J_\\\\delta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {C_{\\\\beta I}}^K e^\\\\alpha_K e^I_\\\\gamma \\\\delta_\\\\delta^\\\\beta - {C_{\\\\beta J}}^K \\\\delta_\\\\gamma^\\\\beta e^\\\\alpha_K e^J_\\\\delta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= {C_{\\\\delta I}}^K e^I_\\\\gamma e^\\\\alpha_K - {C_{\\\\gamma J}}^K e^J_\\\\delta e^\\\\alpha_K \\\\end{align} or :{S_{\\\\gamma \\\\delta}}^{\\\\alpha} = {S_{(\\\\gamma \\\\delta)}}^{\\\\alpha}. Since we have S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} = S_{\\\\alpha [\\\\beta \\\\gamma]} and S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} = S_{(\\\\alpha \\\\beta) \\\\gamma}, we can successively interchange the first two and then last two indices with appropriate sign change each time to obtain, :S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} = S_{\\\\beta \\\\alpha \\\\gamma} = -S_{\\\\beta \\\\gamma \\\\alpha} = -S_{\\\\gamma \\\\beta \\\\alpha} = S_{\\\\gamma \\\\alpha \\\\beta} = S_{\\\\alpha \\\\gamma \\\\beta} = -S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} Implying :S_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta \\\\gamma} = 0, or :C_{\\\\alpha IJ} e_\\\\beta^I e_\\\\gamma^J = 0, and since the e_\\\\alpha^I are invertible, we get C_{\\\\alpha IJ} = 0. This is the desired result.

Kiesler used the project to express an elaborate, personal metaphysics based on the concepts of ‚Äòconnectivity‚Äô, ‚Äòcorreality‚Äô and ‚Äòbiotechnique‚Äô. The project was an attempt to merge the spiritual and practical into a new housing typology. Although the structure was never built to scale, a miniaturized version was constructed for the ‚ÄúVisionary Architects‚Äù exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, which included Louis Kahn, Frank Lloyd Wright, Buckminster Fuller, and Le Corbusier. Kiesler departed in many ways from the modernist ideals of his contemporaries, objecting to pre-fabrication, rationalism, and orthogonal designs in favor of a curvilinear structure. Reception of the ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù was mixed, garnering the praise of such contemporaries as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, while receiving criticism for ideas that were considered to be impractical and outlandish. The ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù concept also appeared in the Japanese publication Bokubi in 1963, and Kiesler's posthumously published artistic journals, titled ‚ÄúInside the Endless House.‚Äù The Endless House model is in the collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art.\\"Frederick Kiesler 1890-1965\\". Whitney Museum of American Art.  Design  The Endless House consists of reinforced concrete over a wire, mesh frame. Its shape is roughly that of a flattened sphere. The structure was elevated on 4 broad pilotis, with two staircases leading to the ground. The layout includes a kitchen/dining room, a living room, a parent's bedroom, a children's bedroom, and a space for seclusion. Windows punctuate the design, and are made of semi-transparent plastic. Different types of flooring throughout the house include sand, grass, terra cotta tile, and pebbles. Kiesler's design is biomorphic; he intended to create an organic space, rather than a geometric, linear one.  Theory  Kiesler's Endless House was intended to communicate his personal views of metaphysics. In terms of architecture, he included abstract aspects of ‚Äòconnectivity‚Äô, ‚Äòcorealation‚Äô, and ‚Äòbiotechnique‚Äô. These terms describe abstract ideas, rather than being specific architectural terms. To show connectivity, Kiesler included curvilinear structure that is built of one material, concrete, with no structural seams in the building. Correalism, the continual interaction between man and nature, meant that Kiesler thought of the rooms of his house as extensions of the bodies of its inhabitants. He explained this in his 1940 article ‚ÄúOn Correalism and Biotechnique‚Äù, published in the Architectural Record.  MoMA  The Endless House was originally commissioned to be built in full scale in the sculpture garden of the Museum of Modern Art.\\"Review: ‚ÄòEndless House‚Äô Expands the Definition of Home\\". New York Times, By JASON FARAGOAUG. 27, 2015. However, a new wing was planned for the museum, which meant that the completed building would only have stood for one year. Instead, Arthur Drexler, director of the museum's department of architecture and design, invited Kiestler to build a scaled down version for his ‚ÄúVisionary Architects‚Äù show, which exhibited 20th century architecture that was considered ‚Äútoo revolutionary to build.\\" The exhibit, which opened on September 29, 1960, featured an 8-foot model of the ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù, a full- scale photographic mural of the house, and a series of drawings and sketches.  Artistic influences  The original plans for Endless House were presented in Vienna in 1924. At that time, Kiesler was active in the European avant- garde, and a member of the De Stijl group. ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù was influenced by Kiesler's interaction with this group, and aimed to comingle art and life by creating an environment that encouraged the occupant's natural inclination towards art. When Kiesler moved to New York City in 1926, he took part in the Surrealist movement, which strove to use art to achieve a healthier, natural mental experience. Kiesler's ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù sketches were not determined by any artistic or architectural conventions, and suggested no particular use of the space: rather, they simply attempted to convey a biomorphic shape, open to the possibilities of its inhabitant's intent.  Critique of Modernism  Kiesler, although often paired with Modernist architects, was an outspoken critic of Modernism and the International Style. He was especially critical of the Modernist invocation of functionality, which assumes a specific use for a space according to present conceptions of use and value. He considered his biomorphic design to be not only more natural than Modernists who strove for organicity, but also more practical for future use, due to its indeterminacy. Although ‚ÄúEndless House‚Äù was presented in 1960 alongside definitively Modernist architecture projects, it was an implicit critique of Modernism.  References   Sources  * Efthymios Warlamis.

He is best known as chief architect of HIV Prevention Trials Network 052, a large- scale randomized clinical trial which demonstrated proof-of-concept for ‚Äútreatment as prevention‚Äù: treating an HIV-infected person with antiviral drugs makes them less contagious and prevents transmission to their sexual partners. Cohen is J. Herbert Bate Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology, and Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is also co-chair of the National Institutes of Health's HIV Prevention Trials Network.  Education  Cohen graduated from James H. Bowen High School in Chicago, and earned a bachelor of science degree. at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, He received his M.D. degree from Rush Medical College in Chicago and did residency training in internal medicine at the University of Michigan. He completed an infectious disease fellowship at Yale University. Cohen joined the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1980.  Research  Cohen was among the first to outline the role of STD co-infections in the sexual transmission of HIV. Not long after the first FDA-approved drug treatment for HIV/AIDS, AZT, appeared in 1987, Cohen began studying the effect of this and later drugs on the amount of virus in genital secretions. This led to the idea that people taking these drugs might be less contagious. In 2005 Cohen launched a clinical study, known as HPTN 052, of 1,763 couples where only one person is HIV-infected. The results indicated that early antiviral therapy reduced sexual transmission by at least 96 percent. Michel Sidib√©, executive director of UNAIDS, called it a ‚Äúgame-changer,‚Äù The Economist speculated on ‚ÄúThe End of AIDS,‚Äù and treatment as prevention became a central part of global HIV/AIDS prevention strategy. In December 2011, Science magazine, named treatment as prevention and HPTN 052 the scientific ‚ÄòBreakthrough of the Year.‚Äô Its editor Bruce Alberts said ‚ÄúThe [HPTN 052] results have galvanized efforts to end the world‚Äôs AIDS epidemic in a way that would have been inconceivable even a year ago.‚Äù  Memberships  Cohen is a fellow of the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Society for Microbiology.

Population: 820 (2010 Census.Kaliningradstat. 2010 Census Results History Before 1945 the area belonged to Germany as part of Landkreis Bartenstein in the Province of East Prussia. German settlers arrived in the area probably during the 13th century and 1300 the Teutonic Order erected a castle (Ordensburg) to protect a crossroad here. The castle was largely destroyed probably already in 1458, but still partially inhabited in 1474 and in the 19th century its cellar vaults were discovered adjacent to the town church. The town, a so-called lischke, grew up around the castle. A church and a school existed at least from 1319, and from 1437 the town had city rights. In 1469 the town became the fief of the knight Konrad von Egloffstein, who built a palace on an island in a lake south of the town. The palace was rebuilt during the 16th century and again in 1778. Caspar Hennenberger served as a priest in the town from 1554 to 1560. The town suffered destruction from fires on several occasions: in 1520, 1571, 1659, 1681 and 1776. In addition, around 60 percent of the town was destroyed in fighting during World War I (later rebuilt). A railway connection was built to the town in 1902.

The conflict is bound in threats and hostility of Iran's leaders against Israel and their declared objective to dissolve the Jewish state, while Israel is concerned by Iran's nuclear weapons program and is seeking to downgrade Iran's allies and proxies, such as the Lebanese Hezbollah political-militant organization. The conflict gradually emerged from Iran's hostile stance toward Israel following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, into covert Iranian support of Hezbollah during the South Lebanon conflict (1985‚Äì2000) and by 2005 developed into a proxy regional conflict. In 2006, Iran was actively involved in supporting Hezbollah during the 2006 Lebanon War and in parallel began supporting Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). Israel, on the other hand, initiated a campaign to harm the Iranian nuclear program, utilizing several anti-regime militias within Iran. Upon the onset of the Syrian Civil War, the conflict escalated and by 2018 turned into direct Iranian-Israeli warfare. Key issues in the conflict include Iran's support of groups opposing Israel, Israel's support of anti- Iranian rebel groups, Iran's nuclear program, and Israel's ties with other rivals of Iran such as Saudi Arabia and the United States. The involvement of both countries in the Syrian Civil War has created additional possibilities for direct conflict between the two states. Iran has provided significant support to Hezbollah Hamas and PIJ, whereas Israel has supported the People's Mujahedin of Iran and has conducted assassinations and attacks against Iranian targets directly. Israel has also conducted cyber warfare against Iran, and has publicly advocated for international military action against Iran.New York Times, 4 Sept. 2019, \\"The Secret History of the Push to Strike Iran: Hawks in Israel and America Have Spent More than a Decade Agitating for War Against the Islamic Republic‚Äôs Nuclear Program. Will Trump Finally Deliver?\\" Israel has accused Iran of attempting to form a continuous land transport route from Iran via Iraq and Syria to Lebanon, which Israel views as a significant strategic threat. Iran views Israel as an illegitimate \\"Zionist regime\\" and its leaders have accused Israel of being an American client state hostile to Muslims. Background Ruhollah Khomeini was critical of Israel before he became Iran's Supreme Leader. He criticized the Pahlavi dynasty Iran's ties with Israel, viewing Israel as a supporter of the Pahlavi regime. Following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Khomeini's new government adopted a policy of hostility towards Israel. Iran withdrew recognition of Israel as a state, and severed all diplomatic, commercial and other ties with Israel, referring to its government as the \\"Zionist regime\\" and Israel as \\"occupied Palestine\\". The 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon resulted in the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) departure from Lebanon. The following creation of Security Zone in South Lebanon has benefited Israeli allies in Lebanon and civilian Israeli population, as Galilee suffered less violent attacks by Hezbollah, than previously by PLO in the 1970s (hundreds of Israeli civilian casualties). Despite this Israeli success in eradicating PLO bases and partial withdraw in 1985, the Israeli invasion had actually increased the severity of conflict with local Lebanese militias and resulted in the consolidation of several local Shia Muslim movements in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Amal, from a previously unorganized guerrilla movement in the south. Over the years, military casualties of both sides grew higher, as both parties used more modern weaponry, and Hezbollah progressed in its tactics. Iran supplied the militant organization Hezbollah with substantial amounts of financial, training, weapons, explosives, political, diplomatic, and organizational aid while persuading Hezbollah to take an action against Israel. Hezbollah's 1985 manifesto listed its four main goals as \\"Israel's final departure from Lebanon as a prelude to its final obliteration\\" According to reports released in February 2010, Hezbollah received $400 million from Iran. By the early 1990s, Hezbollah, with support from Syria and Iran, emerged as the leading group and military power, monopolizing the directorship of the guerrilla activity in South Lebanon. In January 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Iran's nuclear program would only be set back six weeks as a result of its interim agreement with the international community. In one of the region's oddest pairings, Israel and the Gulf Arab states led by Saudi Arabia increasingly are finding common ground ‚Äî and a common political language ‚Äî on their mutual dismay over the prospect of a nuclear deal in Geneva that could curb Tehran's atomic program but leave the main elements intact, such as uranium enrichment. In June 2017, former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon stated that \\"We and the Arabs, the same Arabs who organized in a coalition in the Six-Day War to try to destroy the Jewish state, today find themselves in the same boat with us ‚Ä¶ The Sunni Arab countries, apart from Qatar, are largely in the same boat with us since we all see a nuclear Iran as the number one threat against all of us,\\". History 2000s With the election of Iranian hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005, relations between Iran and Israel became increasingly tense as the countries engaged in a series of proxy conflicts and covert operations against each other. A RPG missile with a symbol of Iran displayed by Israel as \\"found in Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War\\". During the 2006 Lebanon War, Iranian Revolutionary Guards were believed to have directly assisted Hezbollah fighters in their attacks on Israel. Multiple sources suggested that hundreds of Revolutionary Guard operatives participated in the firing of rockets into Israel during the war, and secured Hezbollah's long-range missiles. Revolutionary Guard operatives were allegedly seen operating openly at Hezbollah outposts during the war. In addition, Revolutionary Guard operatives were alleged to have supervised Hezbollah's attack on the INS Hanit with a C-802 anti-ship missile. The attack severely damaged the warship and killed four crewmen. It is alleged that between six and nine Revolutionary Guard operatives were killed by the Israeli military during the war According to the Israeli media their bodies were transferred to Syria and from there, flown to Tehran. On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force destroyed a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria, with ten North Koreans reportedly killed. During and immediately after the Gaza War, the Israeli Air Force, with the assistance of Israeli commandos, was reported to have allegedly carried out three airstrikes against Iranian arms being smuggled to Hamas through Sudan, as Iran launched an intensive effort to supply Hamas with weapons and ammunition. Israel hinted that it was behind the attacks. Two truck convoys were destroyed, and an arms- laden ship was sunk in the Red Sea. On 4 November 2009, Israel captured a ship in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and its cargo of hundreds of tons of weapons allegedly bound from Iran to Hezbollah. 2010 In 2010, a wave of assassinations targeting Iranian nuclear scientists began. The assassinations were widely believed to be the work of Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. According to Iran and global media sources, the methods used to kill the scientists is reminiscent of the way Mossad had previously assassinated targets. The assassinations were alleged to be an attempt to stop Iran's nuclear program, or to ensure that it cannot recover following a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. In the first attack, particle physicist Masoud Alimohammadi was killed on 12 January 2010 when a booby-trapped motorcycle parked near his car exploded. On 12 October 2010, an explosion occurred at an IRGC military base near the city of Khorramabad, killing 18 soldiers. On 29 November 2010, two senior Iranian nuclear scientists, Majid Shahriari and Fereydoon Abbasi, were targeted by hitmen on motorcycles, who attached bombs to their cars and detonated them from a distance. Shahriari was killed, while Abbasi was severely wounded. On 23 July 2011, Darioush Rezaeinejad was shot dead in eastern Tehran. On 11 January 2012, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan and his driver were killed by a bomb attached to their car from a motorcycle. In June 2010 Stuxnet, an advanced computer worm was discovered. It is believed that it had been developed by US and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. In a study conducted by ISIS it is estimated that Stuxnet might have damaged as many as 1,000 centrifuges (10% of all installed) in the Natanz enrichment plant. Other computer viruses and malware, including Duqu and Flame, were reportedly related to Stuxnet. Iran claims that its adversaries regularly engineer sales of faulty equipment and attacks by computer viruses to sabotage its nuclear program. 2011 On 15 March 2011, Israel seized a ship from Syria bringing Iranian weapons to Gaza. In addition, the Mossad was also suspected of being responsible for an explosion that reportedly damaged the nuclear facility at Isfahan. Iran denied that any explosion had occurred, but The Times reported damage to the nuclear plant based on satellite images, and quoted Israeli intelligence sources as saying that the blast indeed targeted a nuclear site, and was \\"no accident\\". Hours after the blast took place, Hezbollah fired two rockets into northern Israel. The Israel Defense Forces reacted by firing four artillery shells at the area from where the launch originated. It was speculated that the attack was ordered by Iran and Syria as a warning to Israel. The Israeli attack was reported to have killed 7 people, including foreign nationals. Another 12 people were injured, of whom 7 later died in hospital. The Mossad was suspected of being behind an explosion at a Revolutionary Guard missile base in November 2011. The blast killed 17 Revolutionary Guard operatives, including General Hassan Moqaddam, described as a key figure in Iran's missile program. Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai wrote that several lower-ranked Iranian missile experts had probably been previously killed in several explosions at various sites. In response to Israeli covert operations, Iranian agents reportedly began trying to hit Israeli and Jewish targets; potential targets were then placed on high alert. Yoram Cohen, the head of Shin Bet, claimed that three planned attacks in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Thailand were thwarted at the last minute. On 11 October 2011, the United States claimed to have foiled an alleged Iranian plot that included bombing the Israeli and Saudi embassies in Washington DC and Buenos Aires. 2012 On 13 February 2012, Israeli embassy staff in Georgia and India were targeted. In Georgia, a car bomb failed to explode near the embassy and was safely detonated by Georgian police. In India, the car bomb exploded, injuring four people. Amongst the wounded was the wife of an Israeli Defense Ministry employee. Israel accused Iran of being behind the attacks. The following day, three alleged Iranian agents were uncovered in Bangkok, Thailand, thought to have been planning to kill Israeli diplomatic officials, including the ambassador, by attaching bombs to embassy cars. The cell was uncovered when one of their bombs exploded. Police responded, and the Iranian agent present at the house threw an explosive device at officers that tore his legs off, and was subsequently taken into custody. A second suspect was arrested as he tried to catch a flight out of the country, and the third escaped to Malaysia, where he was arrested by Malaysian Federal Police. Thai police subsequently arrested two people suspected of involvement. Indian police arrested a Delhi-based journalist in connection with February's car bomb, which injured four Israelis including the wife of an Israeli diplomat. Syed Mohammed Kazmi the journalist was arrested on 6 March 2012, he is said to have been in contact with a suspect police believe might have stuck a magnetic bomb to the diplomat's car. It is said Kazmi was an Indian citizen who worked for an Iranian publication. In late February 2012, WikiLeaks published confidential emails from Stratfor, a US-based private intelligence company, which were stolen by the hacking group Anonymous. Among the information released was a claim that Israeli commandos, in collaboration with Kurdish fighters, destroyed several underground Iranian facilities used for nuclear and defense research projects. On 18 July 2012, a bus carrying Israeli tourists in Bulgaria was destroyed in a bombing attack that killed five Israeli tourists and the driver, and injured 32 people. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran and Hezbollah for the attack. In July 2012, a senior Israeli defense official stated that since May 2011, more than 20 terrorist attacks planned by Iranians or suspected Hezbollah agents against Israeli targets worldwide had been foiled, including in South Africa, Azerbaijan, Kenya, Turkey, Thailand, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Nepal, Nigeria, and Peru, and that Iranian and Hezbollah operatives were incarcerated in jails throughout the world. On 6 October 2012, Israeli airplanes shot down a small UAV as it flew over northern Negev. Hezbollah confirmed it sent the drone and Nasrallah said in a televised speech that the drone's parts were manufactured in Iran. On 24 October 2012, Sudan claimed that Israel had bombed a munitions factory, allegedly belonging to Iran's Revolutionary Guard, south of Khartoum. In November 2012, Israel reported that an Iranian ship was being loaded with rockets to be exported to countries within range of Israel and that Israel \\"will attack and destroy any shipment of arms\\". 2013 In January 2013, rumors were released that the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant had been hit by an explosion. Further reports by IAEA concluded that there had been no such incident. On 25 April 2013, Israeli aircraft shot down a drone off the coast of Haifa, allegedly belonging to Hezbollah. On 7 May 2013, residents of Tehran reported hearing three blasts in an area where Iran maintains its missile research and depots. Later, an Iranian website said the blasts occurred at a privately owned chemical factory. On 10 December, Hamas announced that they have resumed ties with Iran after a brief cut off over the Syrian conflict 2014 A court in Jerusalem has sentenced an Israeli man, Yitzhak Bergel to four-and-a-half years in prison for offering to spy for Iran. Bergel belongs to the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect which is vehemently opposed to the State of Israel's existence. On 5 March 2014, the Israeli navy intercepted the Klos-C cargo ship. Israel stated Iran was using the vessel to smuggle dozens of long-range rockets to Gaza, including Syrian- manufactured M-302 rockets. The operation, named Full Disclosure and carried out by Shayetet 13 special forces, took place in the Red Sea, 1,500 kilometers away from Israel and some 160 kilometers from Port Sudan. Iranian state media reported that on 24 August 2014, IRGC had shot down an Israeli drone near Natanz fuel enrichment plant. Israeli military did not comment on the reports. Two workers were killed in an explosion that took place at a military explosives factory southeast of Tehran, near the suspected nuclear reactor in Parchin. In what seemed to be a response ordered by Iran, Hezbollah set off an explosive device on the border between Lebanon and the Israeli-controlled side of the Shebaa farms, wounding two Israeli soldiers. Israel responded with artillery fire toward two Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. During the Syrian Civil War (2013‚Äì2020) Israel and Syria have observed a truce since Israel reaffirmed its control over most of the Golan Heights in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but the Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has led to several incidents of fire exchange across the once-peaceful borders. The Israeli military is reportedly preparing itself for potential threats should there be a power vacuum in Syria. \\"After Assad and after establishing or strengthening their foothold in Syria, they are going to move and deflect their effort and attack Israel,\\" an Israeli official told The Associated Press in January 2014. Some experts say that while the encroaching militant forces on Israel's border will heighten security measures, the advancements are not likely to create significant changes to Israel's policy disengagement in the Syria crisis. In the Syrian Civil War, hoping to bolster its logistics and force projection capabilities in the area, Tehran aims to clear a path from the Iranian capital to Damascus and the Mediterranean coast. Israeli government is convinced that Iran is interested in creating territorial contiguity from Iran to the Mediterranean and in transferring military forces ‚Äì including naval vessels, fighter planes and thousands of troops ‚Äì to permanent bases in Syria and is trying to \\"Lebanonize\\" Syria and take over using Shi'ite militias, as it had done with Hezbollah in Lebanon. As Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman has warned, \\"everything possible will be done to prevent the existence of a Shi'ite corridor from Tehran to Damascus\\". In 2017, Israeli intelligence discovered an Iranian base being built in Syria just 50 km from the Israeli border. =Covert operations 2013‚Äì2017= On several occasions between 2013 and 2017 Israel reportedly carried out or supported attacks on Hezbollah and Iranian targets within Syrian territories or Lebanon. One of the first reliably reported incidents took place on 30 January 2013, when Israeli aircraft struck a Syrian convoy allegedly transporting Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. Habitually, Israel refused to comment on the incident, a stance that is believed to seek to ensure that the Syrian government did not feel obliged to retaliate. More incidents were attributed to IAF on May 2013, December 2014 and April 2015. Some of those reports were confirmed by the Syrian Arab Republic, whereas others were denied. Israel systematically refused to comment on alleged targeting of Hezbollah and Ba'athist Syrian targets in Syrian territory. In 2015, suspected Hezbollah militants launched a retaliatory attack on Israeli forces in Shebaa farms as a response to an Israeli airstrike in the Syrian Golan that killed Hezbollah and IRGC senior operatives. In March 2017, Syria launched anti- aircraft missiles towards the Israeli-controlled part of the Golan Heights, allegedly targeting Israeli IAF aircraft, which Syria claimed were on their way to attack targets in Palmyra in Syria. After the incident, the State of Israel stated it was targeting weapons shipments headed toward anti-Israeli forces, specifically Hezbollah, located in Lebanon. Israel denied Syria's claim that one jet fighter was shot down and another damaged. Israel has not reported any pilots or aircraft missing in Syria, or anywhere else in the Middle East following the incident. According to some sources, the incident was the first time Israeli officials clearly confirmed an Israeli strike on a Hezbollah convoy during the Syrian Civil War. As of September 2017, this was the only time such confirmation was issued. =Open engagement 2017‚Äì2018= Beginning in January 2017, the Israeli Air Force began flying almost daily attack missions against Iranian targets in Syria, dropping about 2,000 bombs in 2018 alone. Some Iranian targets were also attacked by Israeli surface-to- surface missiles or in raids by Israeli special forces. According to former IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, the decision to strike Iranian bases in Syria was made after Iran changed its strategy in 2016 as the US-led military intervention against ISIL was drawing to an end, planning to exploit the power vacuum to establish hegemony in Syria, building bases and bringing in foreign Shiite fighters. Although the full extent of the campaign would not be revealed until 2019, by early December 2017 the Israeli Air Force confirmed it had attacked arms convoys of Ba'athist Syria and Lebanon's Hezbollah nearly 100 times during more than six years of the conflict in Syria. In January 2019, outgoing IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot claimed that up to that point, only a few dozen Iranian military personnel had been killed in the attacks, as Israel had taken care to primarily target Iranian infrastructure while sparing personnel so as not to give Iran any pretext to retaliate. =Syria, Iraq and Lebanon 2019‚Äì2020= In July 2019, it was reported that Israel had expanded its strikes against Iranian missile shipments to Iraq, with Israeli F-35 combat planes allegedly striking Iranian targets in Iraq twice. Israeli airstrikes reportedly targeted Iran-backed militias in Iraq during 2019. On September 16, 2019, air strikes, targeting three positions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and allied Iraqi militias, killed at least 10 pro-Iranian militiamen in Albu Kamal, Syria. The strikes were allegedly blamed on Israel. According to the time, the increase of Iran-Israel tension concurs with discussion of a possible rapprochement between Iran and the U.S. Israeli aircraft or drones attacked a Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) position in Qousaya, located in the Beqaa Valley of Lebanon, close to the border with Syria on Sunday night, 26 August 2019, according to Lebanese media reports. The attack came a day after two drones exploded in the Lebanese capital Beirut. According to an official from the Palestinian position in the town three air strikes hit the PFLP-GC military position in Quasaya early morning 26 August 2019 causing only material damage. In the first half of 2020, Israel continued to target Iranian weapon depots in Syria. =Cyberwarfare and sabotage 2020= On May 9, 2020, Israel was reportedly behind a cyberattack that disrupted the Shahid Rajaee port in the Strait of Hormuz, causing traffic jams of delivery trucks and delays in shipments. It was suggested the attack was a response to a failed Iranian cyberattack on an Israeli water facility of the Sharon central region in April. In June and July, a series of explosions targeted Iran's nuclear and missile programs and various other infrastructure. There were accidents and damages reported in the Parchin military complex near Tehran on 26 June, the Sina At'har clinic in northern Tehran on 30 June, the Natanz nuclear facility on 2 July, the Shahid Medhaj power plant (Zargan) in Ahvaz and the Karun petrochemical center in the city of Mahshahr on 4 July. It has been speculated that Israel was involved, and the damage at the centrifuge plant in Natanz alone could delay the Iranian nuclear weapons program by one or two years, according to intelligence officials. On July 6, another explosion occurred at the Sepahan Boresh factory in the city of Baqershahr. On July 9, explosions were reported at a missile depot belonging to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps west of Tehran. On July 11, an explosion took place at the basement of an old two-story house containing gas cylinders in northern Tehran. On July 12, a fire broke out at the Shahid Tondgooyan Petrochemical Company in southwest Iran. On July 13, an explosion occurred at a gas condensate plant of the Kavian Fariman industrial zone in the Razavi Khorasan Province. On July 15, a large fire broke out at a shipyard in the city of Bushehr, spreading to seven wooden boats. On July 18, an oil pipeline exploded in the Ahvaz region in southern Iran. On July 19, another explosion took place in a power station in Isfahan. Later in the day, a large fire was registered at a cellophane or yarn factory near the city of Tabriz in northwest Iran. Iranian supporters and alleged proxies Syria The Iran and Syria are close strategic allies, and Iran has provided significant support for the Syrian government in the Syrian Civil War, including logistical, technical and financial support, as well as training and some combat troops. Iran sees the survival of the Syrian government as being crucial to its regional interests.Iranian Strategy in Syria , Institute for the Study of War, Executive Summary + Full report, May 2013 The Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, was reported in September 2011 to be vocally in favor of the Syrian government. When the uprising developed into the Syrian Civil War, there were increasing reports of Iranian military support, and of Iranian training of NDF (National Defence Forces) both in Syria and Iran.BBC Newsnight, report on Iranian military advisor Hadari, 28 October 2013 'Iran's Secret Army' , Iranian security and intelligence services are advising and assisting the Syrian military in order to preserve Bashar al-Assad's hold on power. Those efforts include training, technical support, and combat troops.\\"Syria's crisis: The long road to Damascus: There are signs that the Syrian regime may become still more violent\\", The Economist, 11 February 2012. Thousands of Iranian operatives - as many as 10,000 by the end of 2013Iran boosts support to Syria, telegraph, 21 February 2014 \\\\- have fought in the Syrian civil war on the pro-government side, including regular troops and militia members. In 2018, Tehran said that 2,100 Iranian soldiers have been killed in Syria and Iraq over the past seven years. Iran has also sponsored and facilitated the involvement of Shia militias from across the region to fight in Syria, including Lebanese Hezbollah, Afghan Liwa Fatemiyoun, Pakistani Liwa Zainebiyoun, Iraqi Harakat al-Nujaba, Kataib Seyyed al-Shuhada and Kataib Hezbollah, and Bahraini Saraya Al Mukhtar. Hezbollah Hezbollah has grown to an organization with seats in the Lebanese government, a radio and a satellite television-station, programs for social development and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon's borders. The organization has been called a \\"state within a state\\". Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon, in opposition to the March 14 Alliance. Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon's Shi'a population, while Sunnis have disagreed with the group's agenda. Following the end of the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon in 2000, its military strength grew significantly, such that its paramilitary wing is considered more powerful than the Lebanese Army. Hezbollah receives military training, weapons, and financial support from Iran, and political support from Syria. Hezbollah also fought against Israel in the 2006 Lebanon War. Hezbollah has been a major combatant in the Syrian Civil War, helping to ensure the survival of the Iran-backed Assad government. Active support and troop deployment began in 2012, steadily increasing thereafter. Hezbollah deployed several thousand fighters in Syria and by 2015 lost up to 1,500 fighters in combat. Hezbollah has also been very active to prevent rebel penetration from Syria to Lebanon, being one of the most active forces in the Syrian Civil War spillover in Lebanon. By March 2019, 1,677 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters had reportedly been killed in the Syria.See More than 570 thousand people were killed on the Syrian territory within 8 years of revolution demanding freedom, democracy, justice, and equality. Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Hamas (2005‚Äì2011) Between 2005 and 2011, Iran was one of the main funders and suppliers of Hamas. Israel estimates the Hamas' Brigades have a core of several hundred members, who received military training, including training in Iran and in Syria (before the Syrian Civil War). In 2011, after the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War, Hamas distanced itself from the Syrian government and its members began leaving Syria. Since 2012, Hamas ceased receiving any support from Iran due to Hamas' support of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. In a speech for the spokesman of the Qassam brigades in 2014 on Hamas's 27 anniversary he thanked Iran for aid in finance and weapons. Sudan (2005‚Äì2015) In 2008, Sudan and Iran signed a military cooperation agreement. The agreement was signed by Iran's Defense Minister Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar and his Sudanese counterpart Abdelrahim Mohamed Hussein. In 2011, however, Sudan reduced its cooperation with Iran after the start of the Syrian Civil War. In 2015, Sudan completely severed its ties with Iran, by participating in the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni Crisis on behalf of the Sunni Arab alliance. Palestinian Islamic Jihad Iran is a major financial supporter of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine (PIJ). Following the Israeli and Egyptian squeeze on Hamas in early 2014, PIJ has seen its power steadily increase with the backing of funds from Iran. Its financial backing is believed to also come from Syria. Popular Mobilization Forces Israeli supporters and alleged proxies United States Israel's closest military ally, the United States, has a long history of violence against Iran, including the August 1953 overthrow of the democratic government of Iran by U.S. and U.K. covert operatives, and the decades long U.S. support for the authoritarian rule of the Shah.Clandestine Service History: Overthrow of Premier Mossadeq of Iran, Mar. 1954: p. iii.CIA declassifies more of \\"Zendebad, Shah!\\" ‚Äì internal study of 1953 Iran coup , Danielle Siegel and Malcolm Byrne, National Security Archive, Feb. 12, 2018 The U.S. provided major military and other support to Saddam Hussein's Iraq for decades after Iraq attack Iran, and in 1988, the United States launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iran, the largest American naval combat operation since World War II.Love, Robert William.

Saudi Arabia While Iran is the world's main Shia Muslim-led power, Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. In what has been described as a cold war, the Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict, waged on multiple levels over geopolitical, economic, and sectarian influence in pursuit of regional hegemony, has been a major features of western Asia since 1979.See: * * * American support for Saudi Arabia and its allies as well as Russian and Chinese support for Iran and its allies have drawn comparisons to the dynamics of the Cold War era, and the proxy conflict has been characterized as a front in what Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has referred to as the \\"New Cold War\\". The rivalry today is primarily a political and economic struggle exacerbated by religious differences, and sectarianism in the region is exploited by both countries for geopolitical purposes as part of the conflict. Israel and Saudi Arabia do not have any official diplomatic relations. However, news reports have indicated extensive behind-the-scenes diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between the countries, in pursuit of mutual goals against regional enemy Iran. Azerbaijan People's Mujahedin of Iran * US officials confirm that MEK was financed, trained, and armed by Israel in killing Iranian nuclear scientists. * According to a New Yorker report, members of the Mujahideen-e- Khalq received training in the U.S. and Israeli funding for their operations against the Iranian government. * The MEK aligning with Israel is generally regarded as opportunism on the part of the former, rather than any genuine partnership. Jundallah Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has accused Israel of helping Jundallah to carry out attacks in Iran.

From then until July 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Putin met a total of 9 times. Prior to and immediately after the 2016 United States presidential election, Israel began lobbying the United States to strike a deal with Russia over restricting the Iranian military presence in Syria in exchange for removing U.S. sanctions against Russia. In 2019, Russia rejected an Iranian request to buy S-400 missile defense system. Ruslan Pukhov, head of the Center of Analysis of Strategies and Technologies in Moscow, said: \\"If Russia decides to provide Iran with S-400, it will be a direct challenge to Saudi Arabia and Israel, so it will be against Russia‚Äôs own national interests.\\" See also * Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict * Cold War II * List of modern conflicts in the Middle East * Arab Cold War Notes References Category:Geopolitical rivalry Category:21st-century conflicts Category:Iran‚ÄìIsrael relations Category:Proxy wars ","title":"Iran‚ÄìIsrael proxy conflict"},{"id":"39317317","text":"James Donald Milner (20 November 1874 ‚Äì 15 August 1927) was a British art executive who served as director of the National Portrait Gallery, London from 1916 until his death in 1927.‚ÄòMILNER, James Donald‚Äô, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2008; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 6 May 2013 Life Milner joined the Gallery around 1893, as a Clerk.M.

The division was part of the Soviet forces that crushed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Feskov, p. 97. On 15 December 1956, the division was reorganized as a tank division and renamed the 19th Guards Tank Division.Feskov, p. 97. The 97th Motor Rifle Regiment transferred to the division from the 27th Mechanized Division on the same day. The division's 87th Guards Heavy Tank Regiment dropped the designation \\"Self-Propelled\\", also on the same day. The 67th Separate Tank Training Battalion was disbanded in 1960. In 1961 the 99th Separate Missile Battalion was activated. The 74th Separate Equipment Maintenance and Recovery Battalion was formed on 19 February 1962. The 87th Guards Heavy Tank Regiment became a regular tank regiment around this time. In 1968, the 55th Separate Sapper Battalion became an engineer-sapper battalion. The chemical defence company was upgraded to a battalion in 1972. The 1081st Separate Material Supply Battalion formed from the 690th Separate Motor Transport Battalion in 1980. The chemical defence battalion was once again downsized to a company in 1985. On 7 September 1987, the 99th Separate Missile Battalion became part of the 459th Missile Brigade.

The 1,960-seat theater opened on April 21, 1916, on the former site of Oscar Hammerstein's Vaudeville venue the Victoria Theatre. Together with Strand Theatre, they were the most important movie theatres on Broadway at the time. It exclusively played Triangle Film Corporation films but beginning in 1919, the Rialto Theatre premiered many releases by Paramount Pictures (then known as the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation) until being supplanted by the newly built Paramount Theatre in 1926 as the movie studio's flagship theater in New York City. When Paramount sold the building in 1935, the Rialto Theatre was demolished and rebuilt on a smaller scale, with the rest of the building dedicated to shops and office space. Cat People advertisements at theater entrance in 1942 By the 1970s, the theater had become an adult movie theater. In February 1980, it abandoned adult films in lieu of legitimate theater, becoming host to live theatrical productions. The building also contained a TV studio called Times Square Studios (not related to the studio owned by ABC). It was once home to daytime talk shows hosted by Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams. The building was torn down in 2002 and a high-rise office building was erected in its place.  In popular culture  The Rialto's predecessor, the Hammerstein vaudeville venue, is featured in the 1948 film Portrait of Jennie. Jennie's parents are high- wire trapeze artists who perform at Hammerstein's until tragedy strikes. The Rialto itself also makes an appearance in the film, with a Mickey Mouse cartoon playing in the background.Portrait of Jennie (David O. Selznick, 1948).

He is the first poet to have his words launched into outer space to orbit the earth.  Author, translator, editor  He is recognized as an authority on Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, and the Proven√ßal troubadours, as well as modern Italian writers, including Alberto Moravia, Salvatore Quasimodo, Giovanni Verga, and Giambattista Vico. Bartlett Giamatti referred to him as the ‚Äúgrand statesman of Italian scholarship in America.‚Äù Among his translations are Dante's Divine Comedy (1948), which was published in three-volumes with illustrations by Leonard Baskin, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Prince (1947) and Giambattista Vico's New Science (1946) with Max Fisch. He published scholarly texts and monographs on authors and the literature of renaissance Italy, France, Spain and Proven√ßal. His biography of the Italian author Boccaccio (1981) was considered a ‚Äúnotable book‚Äù of the year by the New York Times, and was a finalist in 1981 for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Biography of Giovanni Boccaccio He edited The Taming of the Shrew for The Yale Shakespeare, and states in the introduction that his ‚Äúbasic principle was fidelity to the text‚Äù of the First Folio of 1623. This in part involved restoring many original wordings and punctuation that long editorial tradition had permitted to be altered. He was prolific; the bibliography of his works in Italian Literature: Roots and Branches (1976), lists thirty-seven books, fifteen contributions to books, fifty articles in periodicals, and almost 500 book reviews. His book Dante (1965) was published during the 700th anniversary year of the birth of the Italian poet, a busy year for Bergin, during which he created a conference at Yale on Dante, he was the editor of the conference papers, which were published in book form as From Time to Eternity, and he travelled extensively lecturing on Dante. Julius A. Molinaro, writing in \\"Forum Italicum\\", the journal of Italian studies, states that there must be few \\"who are not acquainted with some aspect of his work, for it touches many fields ranging ... from the Provencal troubadours to translations of contemporary Italian poetry. Between these limits are a Dante concordance and invaluable books on Dante, Petrarch and Vico.\\"  The Divine Comedy  Dante Alighieri painted by his contemporary Giotto Thomas G. Bergin writes that The Divine Comedy \\"is everything: a personal confession, a vast love lyric, an encyclopedia of the knowledge of the Middle Ages ... and of course quite simply an absorbing narrative.\\" The Divine Comedy is made up of 14,233 lines, divided into three parts; Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso. Thomas G. Bergin's English translation casts Dante's poem into blank verse. It begins with these lines:  Yale  The chapter written by Bergin in the book, My Harvard, My Yale, recounts how from an early age, he had a deep and abiding appreciation for Yale University. He was born in New Haven, not far from the university, he attended public high school, and was awarded the only scholarship that was given each year by the town to a local boy to attend Yale. He entered Yale as an undergraduate in 1921, just as the twenties were beginning to roar. He found there an invigorating academic environment, but also a social stratification that kept the students from more privileged backgrounds apart from the others. Thomas G. Bergin wanted to make his mark at Yale, and recognized that academic achievement was a way open to him. He describes how he \\"came to enjoy learning\\" and by his senior year, he says, \\"it became for me an unadulterated rapture\\". At this point‚Äîtwenty years old and approaching graduation‚Äî an opportunity was presented to him, that would be his life's journey, and it would begin with a required sojourn in Florence, Dante's home. But there was a parental figure who was determined to prevent him from taking this first step. The story of his escape from home, up until the gangplanks are drawn up and the ship sets sail, as he relates it in the essay, \\"Endings and Beginnings\\", is a tale of suspense. He earned his B.A. from Yale in 1925, traveled to Italy to study and live, and then returned to Yale to earn a Ph.D. in romance languages in 1929. He taught at Yale College as a teacher of Italian from 1925 until 1930. In 1949, he became head of Yale's Spanish and Italian Department, and the Benjamin Barge Professor of Romance Languages and Literature. When Bergin returned to Yale after the war, he \\"could see at once how greatly the college system had improved life under the elms.\\" The college system that was introduced in the 1930s had the effect of solving the problem of social stratification by stirring up the social order and getting students from all backgrounds and experiences to live, study and be together‚Äîa richer social life became available to everyone. Another result was that the system of fraternities diminished. Thomas G. Bergin was appointed master of Timothy Dwight College in 1953. As Master, he presided over a community of young scholars who lived in the college. As Master, he also hosted The Timothy Dwight Chubb Fellowship visits of notable people from various walks of life, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 Clement Attlee, conservative presidential candidate of 1964 Barry Goldwater, President Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, actor Fredric March, novelist Iris Murdoch, and future President Ronald Reagan. When the visit by the conservative Californian candidate, Ronald Reagan, was announced, it stirred up controversy in the political atmosphere of 1967‚Äî there were those who wanted the invitation withdrawn. William F. Buckley, Jr., who is described as a \\"life long friend\\" of Bergin, in spite of each man being on opposite ends of the political spectrum, weighed in on the controversy in his syndicated newspaper column. Buckley, writing with what the Yale Daily News described as \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" referred to Bergin as \\"a scholar aesthete of obstinate liberalism.\\" Bergin responded by saying ‚ÄúI always enjoy Buckley‚Äôs prose. For once I find it difficult to quarrel with him.‚Äù Buckley was further inspired to imagine Bergin \\"lamenting the furor over his invitation to Reagan\\" with a quote from the Divine Comedy: ‚ÄúI cannot well report how I entered it, so full was I of slumber at that moment when I abandoned the true way.‚Äù Bergin had a reputation as an impressive speaker with a striking wit. A few of the speeches that he gave as Master, along with other writings and notes posted on the bulletin board, were gathered together and published in the book Master Pieces, which was edited by Bartlett Giamatti and T. K. Seung.The Game, the Harvard-Yale Football Rivalry by Thomas G. Bergin In 1957 he became the Sterling Professor of Romance Languages and Literature, and when he retired in 1973 he became Sterling Professor Emeritus. He was an unofficial historian of Yale in his book on Yale football, Gridiron Glory (1978), and in his column, \\"Time and Change\\", which was published regularly for twenty years in the Yale Alumni Magazine. He wrote of the Harvard/Yale football rivalry in his book The Game (1984). In 1989, Yale established the Thomas Bergin scholarships for Italian majors, and the dining room of Timothy Dwight College was named in his honor.  World War II  During the war, Major Bergin was assigned to the headquarters of the Allied Control Commission in Italy, where he served as director of public relations from 1943 to 1946. For his service during the war, Bergin was decorated with the Bronze Star, the Order of Civil Merit and the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and Ordine della Corona d'Italia from Italy, and the Order of the British Empire. He was stationed in the hills that overlooked the Bay of Naples and the Isle of Capri where the sun would set every night. It was a time when the allied forces had arrived and were battling the enemy, from hill to hill, from the south to the north, leaving behind a bruised and traumatized country. His wartime experiences are expressed in verse in his book, Parco Grifeo.  Poet  The New York Times referred to him as ‚Äúa renowned Dante scholar and a wry poet in his own right‚Äù. His poems are published in books, magazines and quarterlies. His poem, \\"Space Prober\\", became, on November 15, 1961, the first poem sent to orbit in outer space. The poem was inscribed on an instrument panel, and launched on a Transit Research and Attitude Control (TRAAC) Satellite, where it continues to orbit the earth at an altitude of 600 miles, and is expected to continue orbiting for the next 800 years.  Personal life  Thomas G. Bergin, or \\"TGB\\" as he was sometimes known, was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on November 17, 1904, a child of Thomas Joseph Bergin and Irvinea Jane Frances Goddard Bergin. Thomas Joseph Bergin graduated from Yale in 1896. Thomas G. Bergin attended New Haven High School, and then Yale, where he received a B.A. in 1925 and a Ph.D. in romance languages in 1929. He married Florence Bullen of Wallasey, England on December 30, 1929. He taught at Yale College from 1925 until 1930, and was a professor of Spanish and Italian at Flora Stone Mather College of Western Reserve University from 1930 to 1935. He then moved to Albany and taught romance languages at the New York State Teachers College. He then went on to Cornell University from 1941 to 1948 where he was a professor of romance languages. In 1943, he received an appointment to teach at the United States School of Military Government at Charlottesville, Virginia. Thomas G. Bergin died on October 30, 1987, age eighty-three, at home in Madison, Connecticut. He was survived by his wife, who has since died; two daughters, Winifred Hart, of Lexington, Virginia and Jennifer von Mayrhauser of New York; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.  Honors  Thomas G. Bergin's honors include the Dante and Petrarch Medals, the Yale Medal, the Wilbur Cross Medal, Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire, and the Bronze Star for his military service to his country during the war. In recognition of his many contributions to Italian studies, the Italian government made him Commander of the Order of Civil Merit in 1969. He received honorary degrees from Hofstra College in 1958, Fairfield University in 1965, and the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1984. He was awarded the Yale College DeVane Medal in 1975. He was a member of the American Association of Teachers of Italian (president in 1947), the Medieval Academy of America, the Dante Society of America, the American Association of University Professors (president of the Yale chapter from 1951 to 1952), and PEN International.

Career Chan was born in Hong Kong and attended the La Salle College. His study was interrupted by the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong from 1941 to 1945. After the war, he began his working career at the Cable & Wireless PLC. He set up the Cable and Wireless Staff Association in 1970 and became one of its leaders until 1975. The association negotiated with the company and successfully gained the collective bargaining. In April 1973 when Chan was the chairman and deliberately demoted, the association called for work-to-rule and made the company agree to negotiate. When the negotiation broke down in October, the association called for a go-slow and sit-in and the company dismissed 53 workers which made the association going back to the negotiation table. The incident probably led to the introduction of the \\"cooling off period\\". Until the end of 1973 both sides agreed to hook the workers' wage to the civil servants. Chan began to be appointed by the government in various public offices. In 1980, he was appointed by Governor Murray MacLehose to the Legislative Council, to replace the vacant seat left by Leung Tat-shing of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union Council. Before he was appointed to the council, he was made Justice of Peace. He became the special Adviser to director for the Cable & Wireless PLC and director of the Hong Kong Telephone Co. Ltd. and Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation later on. He also held many public positions, including member of Green Mini-bus Operators Selection Board, Fish Marketing Advisory Board, Fisheries Development Loan Fund Advisory Committee, Labour Advisory Board, Public Accounts Committee, Transport Advisory Committee, Vocational Training Council, Working Group of the Transport Advisory Committee on China Motor Bus Maintenance, UMELCO Police Group.

She is known for the play and 2012 film Bachelorette and 2015 film Sleeping with Other People. She co-created the Netflix series Russian Doll, along with Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler.  Early life and education  Headland, raised in suburban Maryland, graduated in 1999 from Staples High School. She received her BFA in drama from the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University in 2002.  Career  Upon graduating college, Headland spent six years working as an assistant at Miramax, a year of which was spent as Harvey Weinstein's personal assistant. Her experience during that time is what inspired her 2012 play Assistance. As a playwright, she is best known for her Seven Deadly Sins cycle: Cinephillia (lust), Bachelorette (gluttony), Assistance (greed), Surfer Girl (sloth), Reverb (wrath), The Accidental Blonde (envy), and Cult of Love (pride). Part of the inspiration for the Seven Deadly Plays came from her Christian upbringing. Her final play in the series, Cult of Love, opened in 2018. She has also written a neo-noir style play The Layover which received mixed reviews in 2016. Headland got her first job in the television industry in 2010 as a staff writer on the FX series Terriers. She wrote and directed the 2012 film version of Bachelorette, which was her debut as a feature film director. Dramatists Play Service published Assistance in late 2013. Headland has directed episodes of the television series Heathers (for which she also served as an executive producer) and two consecutive episodes of the 2016 Starz TV series Blunt Talk, starring Patrick Stewart. She has also directed episodes for SMILF and Black Monday. Headland directed four episodes and co-wrote three episodes of Russian Doll, which she co-created for Netflix with Natasha Lyonne and Amy Poehler. Russian Doll is the first television series that Headland co- created, and she was the last of the three women to come on board for the project. The series premiered on February 1, 2019. On the female driven narrative of Russian Doll, Headland stated, \\"It was really important to explore a show about a female protagonist that asked spiritual and existential questions, as opposed to a show that was about a woman finding romance, a woman finding balance between her personal life and her love life... those are all worthy endeavors and excellent shows are made about all of those things, but we were just thinking 'What hasn't been done?'\\" In 2012, the film version of Headland's play Bachelorette premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Headland directed from her own script; the film co-starred Kirsten Dunst, Lizzy Caplan, and Isla Fisher as three troubled women who reunite for the wedding of a friend played by Rebel Wilson, who was ridiculed in high school. Assistance premiered in 2008 and was staged in 2012 at the New York theatre space Playwrights Horizons. Television rights were acquired by NBC, to be executive-produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay; Krysten Ritter of the ABC series Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 was set to both star and executive produce. Headland is the screenwriter of the 2014 remake of the film About Last Night, itself an adaptation of the 1974 David Mamet play Sexual Perversity in Chicago. In 2015, Headland directed Sleeping with Other People based on her own script, which starred Jason Sudeikis and Alison Brie. At the premier of the film, Headland said in an interview with The Wrap that her ‚Äúelevated‚Äù pitch for the movie was, ‚ÄúLike When Harry Met Sally for assholes.‚Äù The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Headland was hired by Netflix to direct the upcoming film Tell Me Everything, a thriller about marriage based on the young adult novel of the same name. She is also set to executive produce and direct a film based on the novel American Huckster: How Chuck Blazer Got Rich from-and Sold Out-the Most Powerful Cabal in World Sports for HBO Films starring Will Ferrell. She is additionally anticipated to executive produce and direct the first episode of the upcoming Fox series Sisters. Headland has alluded to being involved in a second season of Russian Doll, though no details on the season have been confirmed. On April 22, 2020 it was unofficially announced through Variety that Headland would be the showrunner and writer for an upcoming Star Wars series on the Disney+ streaming service. The series would be female-centric and would take place in a different part of the \\"Star Wars\\" timeline than other projects in the franchise. On May 4, 2020 (Star Wars Day), it was officially announced that Headland will write, executive produce, and serve as showrunner for her own Star Wars series for Disney+.  Influences and themes  Leslye Headland was brought up in a strict religious home and grew up watching the Marx Brothers and MGM musicals. Headland notes that Alfred Hitchcock's film Rear Window was the first time she saw the camera as a tool and realized what a director did. Later in life as she was completing graduate school in New York, Headland notes the difficulty and dark time faced due to the 9/11 attack and names David Fincher's Fight Club as the reason she has a lifelong artistic need to make a joke about what is truly painful. Much of Headland's work focuses on complex female characters and portraying women and women's experiences in a truthful way. Addiction is also a theme that plays heavily into her projects. Regarding her work Headland has stated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm attracted to stories about people who have created prisons for themselves and are trying to get out of them.‚Äù Personal life Headland married actress Rebecca Henderson in September 2016.

Family Born in Tabriz, Mir Sayyid Ali was the son of artist Mir Musavvir. Historian and chronicler Qazi Ahmed said that the son was more talented than his father, but the impact of Mir Musavvir did influence his work. Early works Miniature from Layla and Majnun (c. 1540) Modern research suggests that Mir Sayyid Ali took part in the illustration of the famous Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp created in 1525‚Äì48 for Shah Tahmasp I (1514‚Äì76). Two miniatures in it are attributed to Sayyid Ali's. The next step was his involvement in the creation of the lavish illustrations for the manuscript of Khamsa of Nizami (\\"Five poems\\") created by the best artists of the Shah kitabhane in 1539‚Äì43 by order of Shah Tahmasp. Of the 14 miniatures his brush is credited with four, among them \\"Layla and Majnun\\", which bears the signature of the artist. The period around 1540, contains two remarkable works of the master: a picture of the elegant young man holding a letter disclosed, and a diptych (double frontispiece) for the Khamsa of Nizami with \\"nomad camp of nomads\\" on one sheet and \\"Evening Life Palace\\" on the other. Removal from court In the 1540s, the Shah Tahmasp became increasingly orthodox and grew to reject artistic representations of living creatures. He lost interest in the book miniature, and eventually issued an edict banning secular images throughout the Persian Empire. Artists of his court, including Mir Sayyid Ali, dispersed in all directions. Most took refuge at the court of Shah Tahmasp's nephew, Sultan Ibrahim Mirza. Humayun service Meanwhile, the Mughal emperor Humayun after unsuccessful battles with Sher Shah Suri, lost his throne, and in 1543 arrived in Persia, where Shah Tahmasp gave him a warm welcome and the highest protection. Followed by countless feasts on which Tahmasp persuaded Sunni Humayun to go to the Shiite faith. While Humayun was staying in Tabriz, he became acquainted with the artists, was fascinated by their works, and two of them are invited to the service to him, wanting to create a library-like master of Tabriz. These artists were Abd al-Samad and Mir Musavvir. However, for some reason instead of Mir Musavvir, the service went to his son Mir Sayyid Ali. Humayun did not immediately regain his possessions in the Indian subcontinent. While this struggle took place, it was in a Kabul court. Mir Sayyid Ali arrived there in 1549, lived and worked there for as long as the summer of 1555 Humayun's army defeated in a battle the troops of Sikandar Shah. The Delhi gate was open, and his father Humayun regained the throne. The period of the artist's life in Kabul today carries very few works, among them \\"Portrait of a young writer\\". Mir Sayyid Ali is considered a master of the genre of portraiture, but Persian portraits were to a large extent conditioned and idealized character than were significantly different from the Mughal portrait, which was much more naturalistic. However, the \\"Portrait of a young writer\\" belongs to the best Persian portrait miniatures. Experts from the Los Angeles Museum believe that this may be a self-portrait of the artist. Akbar service The emperor Humayun was succeeded by Akbar, who was an even more passionate lover of portrait miniatures than his father. Mir Sayyid Ali, along with Abd al-Samad from childhood had taught the art of drawing to the future sultan, and between established warm relations. Sayyid Ali headed the imperial court art initiatives, and under his leadership began one of the most ambitious projects in the book of world history - \\"Hamzanama\\" a history of Amir Hamza, the uncle of the prophet Muhammad. The order, which was implemented from 1562 to 1577, was made by Emperor Akbar, and being launched under the leadership of Mir Sayyid Ali, was completed under the supervision of Abd al-Samad, who took over around 1572. Mir Sayyid Ali may have been replaced for being too slow, as at this point the commission was seven years old and only four of the volumes were complete. Under Samad's direction the remaining ten volumes were completed in another seven years.The book was divided into fourteen volumes, each of which contained one hundred illustrations, of larger than usual size, in total - 1,400 miniatures. About 140 miniatures of the work have survived, which are scattered in various museums and collections around the world. Both the heads of the imperial court workshop essentially supervised the work of others, and it is uncertain whether Samad painted any of miniatures himself,Beach, 61 though he may have done or corrected much of the underdrawing. But one miniature, of \\"Elijah the prophet rescues drowning Nur ad-Dahr,\\" is credited to Mir Sayyid Ali. Along with the portrait of his father, Mir Musavvir, and the \\"Wise men, reflecting on the book\\", this shows his late style. late master. Legacy Mir Sayyid Ali remained faithful to the end of the Persian tradition and Akbar, where he worked for an international group of artists who advocated the principles of Persian painting. In his works, one can see the influence of his father's and Sultan Muhammad. His work earned him numerous awards and praise. Vizier of Emperor Akbar I, Abu'l-Fazl, in his History of Akbar (Akbarnama) speaks of him the most enthusiastic manner. In al Fadl's the list of the best artists of the era (he counted more than a hundred) Mir Sayyid Ali tied for first place; al Fadl stating: \\"His art he learned from his father. From the moment he got to the palace, the king's favor beam shone on him. He had distinguished himself by his art ... \\". The emperor Humayun gave him the honorary title of \\"Nadir-ul- Mulk\\" (The Miracle of the kingdom). Seven years after the start of the large project for a \\"Hamzanama\\" that is, approximately in 1569, the artist left the Mughal court, and as a devout Muslim pilgrim went to Mecca. Some researchers believe that he had died during the Hajj, while others say that he returned to the court of Akbar and died in 1580.

The males of some species have evolved exaggerated adornments and mechanisms for self-defense. These traits play a role in increasing male reproductive expectations by triggering male-male competition or influencing the female mate choice,Castillo, R. C. M ES PL C E O ‚Äì PL C E O ‚Äì. VI, and can be thought of as functioning on three different levels: individuals, colonies, and populations within an area.Sturtevant, B. Y. A. H. Essays on Evolution in Social Insects. On The Effects of Selection on Social Insects. 13, 74‚Äì76 (2013)  Male mating tactics  Bee swarm The amount of space accessible and the time both male and female usually determines the site of copulation. Many hymenopteran males constantly fly around specific sites, usually the tops of tall trees, summits, or along hedges, where approachable females are found as they can also be resources visited by females for the purpose of feeding. In honey bee the queens join the mating area alone and are then pursued by a dynamic swarm of males. Those located in the front of the line usually achieve reproduction success. A queen usually mates with twelve males on an average of two mating flights and stores the sperm throughout her entire lifetime. Colonies sustain many males but only a few queens, so only very few males are able to successfully mate with the queen.Guide, T. R. Social Insects : Bees, Wasps, Ants and Termites Teacher Resource Guide. (2011)  Roles  Abedus indentatus belostomatid male with eggs on its back Males can be choosier than females. As an offering, males are capable of providing nuptial gifts secretions, which can be more expensive than female reproductive investment, parental care, where the reproductive costs in males are higher than in females because they invest large quantities of resources and time after egg fertilization, and foraging and nesting sites to the females. Moreover, these factors decrease their subsequent male reproductive opportunities, and the availability of males. An example of male parental care can be found in belostomatid water bugs, where the male, after fertilizing the eggs, allows the female to glue her eggs onto his back. He broods them until the nymphs hatch 2‚Äì4 weeks later. The eggs are large and reduce the ability of the male to fertilize other females and catch prey, and increases its predation risk.Press, C. & Sciences, B. Selection and Social Insects Social insects provide the most surprising predictions and satisfying. 48, 165‚Äì175 (2013) Females are usually in conflict over the acquisition of resources and also tend to compete for male provided resources, thus generating a sex role reversal. Females compete to monopolize parental care,Island, S. Sex Ratios in Field Populations of Reticulitermes spp. (Isoptera) and displace rivals with claspers that appear to be specialized in keeping their hold on males, avoiding takeover attempts by other females.  Characteristics  Male-to-male competition for access to females and for resources that the females require for themselves and their offspring is common and can explain the morphological phenotypic traits and behaviors, such as large body size, weapons, territoriality, and early sexual maturation that increase their possibilities of gaining access to the females.Nonacs, P. Kinship, greenbeards, and runaway social selection in the evolution of social insect cooperation. 2011, (2011) In many social insects, larger males are more competitive and tend to monopolize females or the resources that they need. In bees, females may choose males who are faster, more agile, or more persistent fliers. Sequestering of females and forced copulation may also favor large male size. Males with longer horns and mandibles can use them to fight, or for take over attempts when rivals are copulating. In beetle species, the male horns can be as long as the male‚Äôs body. Early sexually mature males can start their reproductive life before the rest of the male population. Under scramble competition to inseminate females, the early matured males are smaller but can be favored in some cases where courtship occurs on the ground and attain the highest reproductive success. Thus, in the fly Drosophila suboscura, smaller males are better than large males at tracking females during the courtship dance.Baer, B. Bumblebees as model organisms to study male sexual selection in social insects. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 54, 521‚Äì533 (2003) Green- veined white butterfly Mantis The effect of mating on female fitness may vary depending upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources to be used by females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production. A positive relationship between the amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output, as male- transferred material increases female longevity. In some insect species, males can donate some body parts to females such as the leg spurs or the fleshy hindwings of jumped-winged crickets, or they may be completely cannibalized, as occurs in mantis and some dipterous, as well as in some Arachnida scorpions and spider species.  Sexual pheromones  Queen butterfly Sexual pheromones are defined as odors and are one of the prevalent ways in which social male insects find females to mate with. They can be produced in either males or females. The central roles of pheromones are to trigger behavioral interactions between the two sexes.Couvillon, M. J. et al. Sexual selection in honey bees: colony variation and the importance of size in male mating success. Behavioral Ecology 21, 520‚Äì525 (2010) Ultimately, this brings the sexes together for mating purposes. In addition, females discriminate against mates by the judgment of their sex pheromones.Herbers, J. M. Darwin‚Äôs ‚Äúone special difficulty‚Äù: celebrating Darwin 200. Biology letters 5, 214‚Äì7 (2009) Courtship pheromones are issued in many cases by males. In the queen butterfly Danaus gilippus and the Arctic moth Utetheisa ornatrix, the chemical stimulation of the female is necessary for male mating success.  Acoustic and visual signals  Firefly In species such as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the darkness and emit a species-species specific pattern of light flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash contribute to the success in attracting females.Couvillon, M. J. et al. Sexual selection in honey bees: colony variation and the importance of size in male mating success. Behavioral Ecology 21, 520‚Äì525 (2010 Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf hoppers, and tree hoppers. In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.Tarpy, D. R., Nielsen, R. & Nielsen, D. I. A scientific note on the revised estimates of effective paternity frequency in Apis. Insectes Sociaux 51, 203‚Äì204 (2004) Female calling syndrome occurs when female social insects emit a typical call to the males in close proximity to their natal nests. Males that are attracted by the callings fly extensively in pursuit of potential mates. Their gasters raise and stings start to protrude. The venom glands are a basis of a chemical male attractant. In Xenomyrmex floridanus, the queen‚Äôs venom glands and gasters both attracted males and prompted copulation.

The Clock tower in Bitola, unlike obsolete water towers which were built by the Austro Magjar empire, is a very practical monument aiding people with the time of day. According to legend, even though the existence of the Clock Tower was mentioned before in 1664, the present Clock Tower was built in the 1830s, in the same period when the Orthodox Church of St. Demetrious was being built.The Clock Towers of Macedonia, Mirjana Dimovska, 2008, Skopje, RM It is located in the immediate center of Bitola on the northern part of the main street Sirok Sokak not far away from Magnolia Square, where there are numerous cultural and historical monuments, as well as new construction. The clock tower is 33 meters high, with sides of per 5.8 m.Bitola Tourist - Saat Kula On all four sides are entrenched special metal plates mounted to the hands and inscribed with Roman numbers from one to twelve. On the uppermost part is a small dome, which offers a beautiful panorama of the city and the wider environment. In more recent times restoration was conducted on the tower, which has not changed its original appearance.Bitola Babam Bitola - Saat Kula The clock tower was constructed with massive stone blocks. The main and also most decorative part of the Clock Tower is the part where you set the clock. The entrance to the clock tower encircled by large marble blocks is located on the north side and about a hundred stairs leads to the clock, to its peak of approximately 32 m. These steps lead to the top where in the past the big metal bells stood indicating the time. In 1927 its first clock mechanism was developed by the German company Konfage. People that were required to ring the bells were replaced with so called sajdzhii (clock keepers) who were responsible for maintaining the clock and the clock mechanism. At first there was white clock face with black numbers and hands, and was smaller than the present. This clock mechanism was replaced in 1936. 15 new bells (weighing 900 kg) were placed in the tower as a sign of gratitude for the construction of the Memorial Cemetery of German soldiers killed in the First World War. In 1962 the mechanism was restored, and in 1970 a keyboard mechanism was installed to play new songs. The Clock Tower is one of the 180 towers in the world which has embedded such a mechanism.

He practiced medicine in Woburn until 1875, in Cambridge and Boston until 1881, when he moved to New York and practiced there (1881‚Äì1901). In 1901, he retired and moved to West Falmouth, Massachusetts. Work He invented a large number of surgical instruments; contributed over 400 articles to literature on scientific subjects, including microscopic medicine, laryngology, chronic diseases and general medicine; and became a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1856, and of the American Medical Association in 1871. He was a pioneer of laryngology in the United States. He studied the morphology of raw beef from 1854, and discovered the tuberculosis cattle test in 1894. He made investigations into electrotherapeutics, in 1871 demonstrating that galvanic currents could reach deep into the body. In his later career, he took interest in nutrition as well as cancer. Personal He was deacon and clerk of the First Congregational Church in Woburn from 1864 to 1874. With his first wife, he was instrumental in organizing the Church of the Comforter in the Bronx, and was a lay member of the General Synod of the Reformed Church in the United States in 1898. He wrote much on church music. He married twice: in 1856, he married Rebecca Smith, with whom he had nine children; she died in 1899, and in 1901 he married Anna L. Davidson, who survived him. Ephraim Cutter died at his home in West Falmouth on April 25, 1917. Notes References * External links * * Written in collaboration with his son.

The Stags competed as part of Major League Ultimate (MLU) in the league's Western Conference until the league suspended operations in 2016. The team was one of the original eight teams that formed the MLU in 2013. The team saw the post-season three times and in 2016 saw its first appearance at the MLU Championship. History 2013 For their inaugural season the General Manager, Nathan Schorsch, brought on long-time ultimate player Justin Becker to lead the Stags as head coach. The first game of the Stags career began against the San Francisco Dogfish. While it was a fairly close game the Dogfish claimed victory 11-14. It wasn't until the fourth week of the season that the Stags found their first victory, playing again against the Dogfish, this time in Portland at Lewis and Clark College. Both teams played a close match with the Dogfish leading for a majority of the game, but the Stags were able to pull ahead in the final minutes. This was the Stags only victory of the season, leaving them with a 1-9 record.  2014  In their second season, the Stags looked to overhaul not only their losing but the entire team's philosophy by bringing on head coaches Danny Quarrel and Mike Knapp. Despite, or because of, little roster turnover from 2013 to 2014 there was little thought of the Stags making their way out of the MLU basement. One additional roster addition of note was the signing of Seattle Rainmaker Mark Burton, who was the second highest goal scorer in 2013. Opening the season with a 23-21 over the #2 ranked Vancouver Nighthawks turned a few heads for the Portland Stags. The Stags continued to impress with two victories over the San Francisco Dogfish and didn't see their first loss until week 4 when they dropped a game 23-25 against the Rainmakers. The Stags finished out the regular season 8-2 with losses to both the Rainmakers and the Nighthawks. With the best record in the Western Conference, the Stags saw their post-season and hosted the Vancouver Nighthawks at Lincoln High School Stadium. While the Nighthawks were able to take an early lead the Stags were able to tie up the game but never found themselves at the advantage and missed their first shot to the MLU Championship 13-14. 2015 The 2015 season brought further coaching changes for the Stags when Mike Knapp left the team. Join head coach Danny Quarrell and filling Knapp's absence were two assistant coaches, Mike Grill and former player turned player-coach John Thornton. With 20 returning players the Stags experienced little roster turnover from 2014 to 2015, with all of their top players returning. The Stags were able to roll through the conference with only a single loss, coming against the Dogfish in week six, 17-18. With the conference record, the Stags again hosted the Western Conference Championship (again at Lincoln High School Stadium) this time facing off against the second-ranked Seattle Rainmakers. The Rainmakers were able to take advantage of an early lead in the game that they never gave up, ending the Stags second post-season run 16-17. 2016 In 2016 the Stags won the Western conference final.

Kumar. The film stars Pooja Umashankar as Rekha, a prostitute trying to rescue a 12-year-old girl, played by Malavika Manikuttan, from the clutches of prostitution. The music was composed by Girishh Gopalakrishnan. Vidiyum Munn was the fifth Indian film to be released in Auro 3D 11.1 surround sound system. The film was released by PVR Pictures on 29 November 2013 to Critical acclaim but average grosser at the box office. The movie was reported to be inspired by the 2006 British movie London to Brighton.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/southern-movies-inspired- without-credit-heres-list-20556  Synopsis  The plot unfolds as a taut thriller that examines the characters' vulnerability and strengths. The subplot, however, explores a relationship between a woman & a girl; Rekha, the protagonist, is a sex worker who tries to rescue Nandhini, a twelve-year-old girl, from the clutches of prostitution. The journey takes us through the brutality and the hypocrisy that surrounds us, which we deliberately choose to ignore‚Äîbroken homes, abuse, unfulfilled dreams, manipulation, blackmail, threat, hopelessness and paranoia. It's a dog-eat-dog world where nothing is as simple as it appears. Rekha, an aging prostitute, is seen selling herself to old and low level people in order to eke out a living. During one of her sessions, she meets with her old pimp Singaram, who informs her that he needs her help to bring in a virgin, prepubescent girl for one of his major clients, Periayyah, an unnamed, wealthy liquor baron of India. She refuses in the beginning and accepts reluctantly, after he agrees to split the profits with her. Singaram takes Rekha to meet with her old pimp and ex-lover Dorasingam, who is now bedridden and furious at Rekha for leaving him. However Rekha convinces him to deliver the girl to her, on the condition that the girl be returned the very next day. After picking up the girl Nandini, Rekha travels with Singaram to get the girl ready for the night. Even though she tries to develop a bonding with the girl, Nadini shies away, avoiding to talk to Rekha. Although Rekha does not tell Nadini about what is going to happen to her, she is constantly tormented by her actions and feels responsible for the girl. Everything goes according to Singaram's plan and Rekha accompanies the girl to Periayyah's mansion. Perriayyah takes the girl upstairs and starts to tie her up. As the girl prostests, Perriayyah is seen taking up a razor blade, when suddenly Rekha breaks into the room and a struggle ensues, in which Perriayyah is killed. Rekha and Nandini escape the mansion and go on the run. Singaram is then visited by the henchmen of Chinnayyah, Periayyah's son. They question her about the girl he sent and threaten him to find them within a day. An intimidated Singaram approaches Lankesh, a rouge detective with an eye for details. Lankesh agrees to help Singaram to track down the girl for a sum. In his search of Rekha's apartment, he discovers a photo of her friend taken in Srirangam, and concludes that the two are headed there. As this happens, Dorasingam's men spot the girl and Rekha on a train. They decide to kidnap her, but their attempts are thwarted and the two escape to Srirangam and meet with Devanayagi, Rekha's old friend. While on his search Chinnaiyyah and his men kill Dorasingam while also killing a man that knew about his fathers bad habits Lankesh with Singaram tracks down the house in which Devanayagi lives, and takes Rekha and Nandini out while calling Chinnaiyah to the area, so he can have his revenge against them for killing his father. Chinnaiyah arrives with his men but orders them to kill Singaram and Lankesh instead while giving money to Rekha to live her life onwards. The reasoning behind this is when Chinnaiyah was in school, his father took a classmate of his and ended up raping and killing her. Disgusted with his fathers actions, Chinnaiyah decides to look for the person that killed his father and give them hope  Cast  * Pooja Umashankar as Rekha * Malavika Manikuttan as Nandhini * R.

The Mask of Warka (named after the modern village of Warka located close to the ancient city of Uruk), also known as the Lady of Uruk, dating from 3100 BC, is one of the earliest representations of the human face. The carved marble female face is probably a depiction of Inanna. It is approximately 20 cm (8 inches) tall, and was probably incorporated in a larger wood cult image, though it is only a presumption that a deity is represented. It is without parallels in the period.Frankfort, 31-32 It is in the National Museum of Iraq, having been recovered undamaged after being looted when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. It could depict a temple goddess. Shells may have served as the whites of the eyes, and the lapis lazuli, a beautiful, blue semi-precious gemstone, may have formed the pupils. Description The Mask of Warka is unique in that it is the first accurate depiction of the human face. Previous attempts, like the Tell Brak Head, were not anatomically accurate, and featured exaggerated noses and ears. At tall, the mask was most likely originally part of a whole, life sized statue, probably made of wood, with the exposed areas of \\"skin\\" (arms, hands, feet, and most obviously the head) being the only ones made of the much rarer white marble. The back of the head would have been covered with bitumen and then colored metal ‚Äî most likely either gold leaf or copper. This combination would have then extended over the forehead in waves. This hairpiece would have been attached to the Mask with metal studs, which could possibly have been engraved. The hollowed out eyes and eyebrows bear traces of an ancient inlay, perhaps shell and lapis lazuli. Perforations at the ears indicate that the image once wore jewelry. Parts of the eyebrows and hair were also emphasized with colored inlays. Collon, Dominique. Ancient Near Eastern Art. Illustrated ed. University of California Press, 1995. Print. The back of the head is flat, with drill holes for attachment.Frankfort, 31-32 Discovery The Mask of Warka was discovered on 22 February 1939 by the expedition of the German Archaeological Institute, led by Dr A. N√∂ldeke, in the city of Uruk south of modern Baghdad. The Mask was found in the Eanna (or Ianna) district of the city ‚Äî so named for the goddess Inanna to whom the temples are dedicated. Matthews, Roger. \\"Uruk-Warqa, Iraq.\\" Current World Archaeology 23 (2007) Print. Theft and Recovery When the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, the National Museum of Iraq (where the Mask of Warka was stored) was looted. The Mask is thought to have been taken between April 10 and 12 of that year, along with forty other pieces, including the Warka Vase and Bassetki Statue. The effort to recover these artifacts was spearheaded by Marine Reserve Colonel Matthew Bogdanos, who started an investigation with his team on April 21. However, it was the 812th Military Police Company (Combat Support) USAR, out of Orangeburg, New York, that recovered the Mask just before October. According to Bogdanos, \\"An informant, an individual, an Iraqi, walked into the museum with a tip that he knew where antiquities were being held or hidden, without identifying the mask. Acting on that information, members of the investigation who are still in Baghdad then went to that location, conducted a reconnaissance, and then conducted a raid. The results of the raid were ultimately good, but Bogdanos explains that hopes were not initially high. ‚ÄúInitially they didn't find the Mask, but they found the owner of the farm-- it's a farm in northern Baghdad-- and after interviewing the farmer, he admitted that he did in fact have an antiquity, in this case the Mask, buried in the back of his farm. The investigators went behind the farm and uncovered the Mask exactly where he had placed it, and it is intact and undamaged.\\" Brown, Jeffery. \\"Recovering History.\\" PBS Newshour (2003) Print.

He supported German expansion in Central and Eastern Europe and was involved with the planning of ethnic cleansing by the Third Reich during the Second World War. After 1945 he exploited the Cold War to promote the interests of German nationalism and chauvinism in his historical writing. Early life Keyser studied history in Freiburg, Halle and Berlin. He published his doctoral thesis in 1918, which dealt with the earliest settlement and economic history of Danzig. Interwar years Keyser publicly espoused nationalist theories and hatred towards Poles.Rocznik gda≈Ñski - Tomy 28-30 - Page 316, 1970 - W≈õr√≥d nich figuruje znany ju≈º w okresie miƒôdzywojennym z nienawi≈õci do Polak√≥w dr Erich Keyser.

In such works he included psychological study of national character traits which led him to support Rassenforschung (racial studies). He was especially interested in the \\"racial categorization of the current population of Germany and in the racial classification of psychological remains from the centuries of the past\\". He considered the Germans the only representatives of historical life in Prussia and supported the volkisch movement.The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772 - page 4 Karin Friedrich - 2006 Erich Keyser in Danzig supported the volkisch idea of history and considered the 'German people the real (and only) representative of historical life' in Prussia.

Passmore - 1999 \\"Hans Koch, Erich Keyser, Walter Kuhn, Manfred Laubert, Theodor Oberlander, Peter Heinz Seraphim and Hans Uebersberger were actively involved in planning and implementing the so- called 'repopulation' (Uinvolkung) of German, Polish, Jewish and other ethnic groups in occupied territories.\\" and contemplated ways in which Poles unsuitable for Germanization could be efficiently removed in a quick manner.PrzeglƒÖd historyczny, Volume 97, Issues 1-4 Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawn. Naukowe, 2006 page 204 Keyser was directly involved in Germanization attempts aimed at the Polish population in territories Nazi Germany annexed from Poland and formed in the so-called Danzig-West Prussia region. In autumn 1940 Keyser attended the conference on \\"History of Population\\" in Berlin, representing the Office of Regional Studies in Danzig, alongside other leading Nazi scholars such as Hermann Aubin and Theodor Schieder. Part of Keyser's report concerned a project regarding germanizing names in territories annexed from Poland which were formed into Reichsgau's, while another concerned the history of population along Vistula River with the purpose of assisting with future population policy measures. Keyser along with other Nazi researches worked on compiling the German National List (Deutsche Volksliste DVL), and calculated that approximately 30,000 Polish families should be Germanized. Despite the war, Keyser continued to expand his studies, by increasing the number of pages in his book about population history and adding in second edition in 1941 such section headings as \\"What is the Nature of the German People\\" and \\"People and Population\\". A new section called \\"People and Race\\" was introduced in third edition of 1943, while section \\"Aliens in Germany\\" discussed \\"the first appearance of the Jews\\", \\"National Socialist population policy\\" and \\"the immortality of the German people\\". In 1943, Keyser supported involvement of German historians and researchers in Nazi population policies and idea of connection between studies of \\"race\\" and demographics stating that \\"The will of the German people to cleanse itself of undesirable racial components\\" was the driving force behind such actions. In 1944 when Nazi Germany was losing the war, he praised Adolf Hitler in a Nazi magazine \\"Wille and Macht\\" (\\"Will and Power\\") stating that \\"The victory of the German troops of all Germanic tribes under the leadership of Adolf Hitler banished, in autumn 1939, the ghost of Versailles\\".Deutsch-polnische Hefte - Volume 3 - Page 653 1960Dzia≈Çalno≈õƒá naukowa i rola polityczna katedr filologicznych Politechniki Gda≈Ñskiej w latach 1925-1944 Micha≈Ç Cie≈õla (prof. nadzw. dr.) page 12 Wydawn.

He outlined new objectives of the German Ostforschung in 1952 in order to legitimize traditional German chauvinism by depicting Germans as bringers of order and development in Eastern Europe in concert with other European nations. This attempt had obvious connections to the past and tried to put Germans and Western community against an undefined \\"East\\".Michael Burleigh Cambridge University Press, Germany turns eastwards: a study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich, Volume 8, Part 1991 page 315 \\"The objectives of the new German Ostforschung were outlined by Keyser in 1952. Necessity and sense of duty had compelled them all to begin anew. The German people were duty bound to study some seven hundred years of their history in the East the decisions of Yalta and Potsdam reflected an unknowning of German history. Narrow chauvinism was to be replaced by a sense of a European community to which the peoples of the East belonged. In practice this meant that the Germans had brought Christianity, cultural improvement, political order and economical development to the East in collaboration with other European nations. This internationalizing of traditional German chauvinism barely concealed the legacy from the past.A Western community of interest, juxtaposed against an undefined 'East', was apparent in much of the historical work produced by Ostforscher(...) He became responsible for the Herder Institute placing its work into the context of Ostforschung and openly declaring that its mission was to change the map of Europe and Germany, stating \\"Germany does not end at the Elbe, Oder or at the Vistula\\"; the Institute openly and proudly demonstrated its continuity with past research under Nazi regime.The Quest for the Lost Nation: Writing History in Germany and ... - page 224 Sebastian Conrad - 2010 page 175 Erich Keyser also consciously placed the Herder institute's work into the context of the Ostforschung tradition, which after 1945 was represented as a decidedly European project Only after his death did the Herder institute gradually begin to escape from ethnocentric study of history and started studying ethnic groups in the region on a more equal basis.

The gardens feature grassed and formal bedding areas, with other facilities including a children's play area and basketball court. Background Easton Gardens' play area. The idea of transforming an area of Tophill into a public garden was first suggested in 1896, along with the transformation of another Portland site, Little Common, into Victoria Gardens. Easton Square was later chosen as Tophill's site in 1901 and plans, created by engineer Mr R. S. Henshaw, were approved in August 1903. That year saw work commence on their creation, with Messrs Stewart & Sons tasked with laying out lawns, flower beds and footpaths, along with a bandstand. The gardens were opened by Mr Henry Sansom, Chairman of the Portland Urban District Council, on 18 August 1904, in front of large audience. The day was noted for its sunshine. In 2004, locals donned costumes of the 1900s to celebrate the garden's 100th anniversary. In recent years, Easton Gardens has been awarded Green Flag status. In 1905, Sansom suggested the erecting of a clock tower within the gardens. Designed by R. Stevenson Henshaw, the clock was built by Wakeham Brothers and unveiled during a ceremony in May 1907. As a prominent feature in the square ever since, the clock tower became Grade II Listed in 1993. English Heritage's survey noted that the clock is a Jacobethan-styled structure with Gothic details.

Only one was completed and flown, its makers preferring to develop a biplane fighter. Design and development The Letov ≈†-3, originally known as the Letov ≈†.B1, was the first original fighter design from Letov, the start of a line designed by Alois ≈†molik. It had a wooden parasol wing and a metal-framed fuselage and empennage, and was powered by a six-cylinder water-cooled in-line BMW IIIa engine. The wing was only slightly tapered, being almost rectangular and with a cutout in the trailing edge over the cockpit to improve the pilot's field of view. Short-span ailerons were mounted far outboard. On each side there were two pairs of parallel struts bracing the wing to the fuselage; both pairs were mounted on the lower fuselage but one pair met the wing at about 60% span, the other at 30%. Each outer strut had a jury strut at right angles which met the top of its inboard equivalent at the wing. The ≈†-3's upright inline engine was completely enclosed within a cowling, with its top just below the pilot's eye line. It drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. The BMW was cooled with Lamblin cylindrical radiators placed between the undercarriage legs, though a diagram shows it with narrow, fuselage-hugging (cheek) radiators. The oval cross-section fuselage tapered rearwards behind the cockpit to a straight tapered tailplane and divided elevators with a cutout for rudder movement; the latter was mounted on a circular-edged fin and had its bottom cropped for elevator clearance. The ≈†-3 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts. The first prototype was destroyed late in 1921 by a factory fire before its first flight, but the second flew early the next year. It took part in the International Meeting at Zurich in 1922 with modest success but the Military Aircraft Works decided to concentrate its efforts on the biplane Letov ≈†-4, and development of the ≈†-3 ended.

CAFE is sometimes portrayed as a moderate and academic voice, particularly by members of men's movement, such as author Warren Farrell, though media reports have characterized the group as controversial,Other sources:  and various feminist, student, and anti-domestic violence groups associate CAFE with more radical men's rights organizations such as A Voice for Men.Other sources:  * CAFE spokesperson Justin Trottier has denied these allegations. CAFE hosts a regular series of speakers and talks, featuring speakers such Warren Farrell, _University_ of Ottawa English Professor Janice Fiamengo, and McGill Professors Katherine K. Young and Paul Nathanson.

History  Campus activities CAFE became the focus of mainstream media attention when they hosted controversial author and masculinist Warren Farrell to speak at the University of Toronto on November 16, 2012. The talk was met with protests from a coalition of activist groups, U of T Students United Against Sexism. The protesters accused Farrell and CAFE of \\"misogyny, and of protecting and denying male privilege.\\" The event attracted a group of about 50-100 protesters who argued that Farrell's talk was hate speech and chanted \\"No Hate Speech on Campus\\" throughout the demonstration. The event was briefly delayed after protesters blocked access to the venue, before police intervened, allowing the event to proceed. Police and campus police who were stationed at the event arrested one protester before releasing them without charge, while another was cautioned for assaulting a police officer. After the protest, several of the women who had protested against Farrell's talk were subjected to online bullying and harassment, after their pictures, names, and other identifying information were posted on the website register-her.com, which was operated by American men's rights group A Voice for Men. Follow up events in CAFE's monthly lecture series were also marked by significant protest, and required a police or campus police presence. These events included a presentation by Professor Janice Fiamengo titled \\"What's Wrong with Women's Studies,\\"See press reports:  and a panel discussion by McGill academics Professors Katherine K. Young and Paul Nathanson, authors of Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture. After protests at a CAFE event in April 2012, A Voice for Men uploaded a video of one of the protesters. The video quickly reached more than 100,000 views online, while hundreds of men's rights activists posted comments threatening to beat, rape, and murder the woman in the video. The woman told Maclean's that men's rights activists distributed her home address and personal information online, and sent her hundreds of graphic, and sexualized threats of violence - some of which included personal details such as her favourite bars and her dog's name. CAFE has faced resistance from student's unions and other activist groups in attempting to set up campus chapters. The University of Toronto Student Union rejected an application for ratification from the University of Toronto Men's Issues Awareness Society in 2012, and in March 2013 the Ryerson Students' Union (RSU) rejected the application for ratification from the Ryerson Equality Association for failing to \\"centre women's voices.\\" The Ryerson group was led by two female students. In the week prior to rejecting the group, the RSU had passed an emergency motion to oppose \\"the concept of misandry,\\" a position they then referenced to justify the group's prohibition. In January 2014 the Canadian Association for Equality announced it would sponsor events at Ryerson hosted by members of the University community, starting with a presentation by female men's activist Karen Straughan in February 2014. By 2016, CAFE was affiliated with 15 men's issues campus groups across Canadian universities. The group frequently sponsors events hosted by the University of Toronto Men's Issues Awareness Society.\\" In November 2015, the Ryerson University Men's Issues Awareness Society was denied certification. Charity application In March 2014 the Canadian Association for Equality was granted charitable status by the Canada Revenue Agency. In its application for charitable status, the group listed organizations such as the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund, Egale Canada and the Status of Women Canada as potential participants in panel discussions and other CAFE events. When informed that they had been listed as potential participants in CAFE events on the application, however, LEAF charged CAFE with being \\"very disingenuous\\" with their application, noting that \\"we absolutely are not associated with this group and what they stand for,\\" while an Egale Canada spokesman made it clear that \\"Egale is not affiliated or associated with [CAFE] in any way.\\" Queens University Professor Sarita Srivastava was \\"stunned\\" to learn that CAFE had claimed to be \\"currently\\" setting up a panel discussion with her on their charitable status form, noting that she had declined to participate in such a discussion months earlier. Several individuals and organizations listed on the application suggested that CAFE had a \\"problem with their reputation\\" and had invited listed feminist individuals and groups on the application \\"to counter criticism that they are anti-feminist and one-sided.\\" Equality Day Concert In May 2014, CAFE organized an Equality Day concert in support of men's parental rights and Conservative MP Maurice Vellacot's Bill C-560, \\"An Act to amend the Divorce Act (equal parenting),\\" which was defeated on May 28. The event was scheduled to take place at Artscape Gibraltar Point, a performance space on the Toronto Islands, but Artscape cancelled the event days before it was scheduled to place, after receiving an email which indicated that the event might be a political one, in contravention of Artscape's policies. An Artscape spokesperson suggested that the event had been presented to them as \\"a fair and equitable event that was family-friendly and a lovely music festival,\\" but that Artscape had elected to cancel the event after it \\"turned political.\\"Other sources:  Three of the musical acts which had been scheduled to perform at the event later suggested that they had been misled about the event's purpose and CAFE's platform. Musical group the Hogtown Brewers apologized for their involvement, noting that \\"we were not aware of the true nature\\" of CAFE, and suggesting that \\"we would not have knowingly supported this cause.\\" Similarly, musical group Giraffe suggested that \\"we feel that we were not fully informed about what it was that is being supported here,\\" and that CAFE had been \\"intentionally misleading to us in its effort to entice us to play this show.\\" Canadian Centre for Men and Families In 2013 the Canadian Association for Equality announced plans to build Toronto's first \\"Men's Centre,\\" to be named the Canadian Centre for Men and Families.Sources:  After a successful capital campaign, the Centre opened in downtown Toronto in November 2014, under the directorship of CAFE co-founder Justin Trottier.Sources:  * The Centre runs a variety of men's programs: counseling and peer support, a fathering group, legal services, mentorship for boys and young men, and support for male victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse and trauma. The center has worked to raise awareness of domestic violence against men, and Trottier has said that \\"We've long known that domestic violence victims span all ages, races and ethnicities. Now we're becoming aware they also span all genders and sexual orientations. Yet fathers and their children experiencing abuse often have no place to go.\\" Writing about male suicide rates, The Province writer Kent Spencer called the center \\"the country's first men's-only shelter in Toronto, which provides safe space, peer support and services for male victims of trauma and violence.\\" In August 2017 CAFE became the first organization for male survivors of domestic abuse authorized by Legal Aid Ontario to provide legal aid certificates to male victims of domestic violence.  Pride parade controversy  On June 27, 2014 Pride Toronto revoked CAFE's permit to march in the 2014 World Pride Parade, despite regulations which prohibited the cancellation of permits after June 21. Pride Toronto executive director Kevin Beaulieu explained the decision to bar CAFE from the parade by suggesting that it had been made out of concern that the CAFE's work \\"may contravene the spirit of the Mission, Vision and Values of Pride Toronto,\\"Other sources: * * and in response to public concerns \\"about the activities and purpose of CAFE and whether they actually match the intent they express\\" CAFE representatives characterized the decision to exclude their organization from the parade as \\"regrettable,\\" asserting that the organization is \\"not anti-woman\\" and is \\"absolutely inclusive.\\" Despite having their permit to march revoked, CAFE members marched in the June 29 Parade, alongside marchers from the Sherbourne Health Center, a community clinic focused on the health needs of new immigrants to Toronto, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, and the homeless or under-housed. The CAFE members initially arrived at the parade wearing CAFE T-shirts, but were asked to wear Sherbourne Health Center T-shirts instead, and they passed out CAFE buttons along the parade route. Speaking to the press after the Parade, Sherbourne Health Center's director of human resources stated that the group had been unaware of the controversy surrounding CAFE's participation in the parade. Stating that \\"Sherbourne unequivocally does not endorse or support CAFE,\\" he suggested that \\"had we had time to conduct any background research, we would have politely declined their request to join us.\\" In June 2015, CAFE was banned from all future events organized by Pride Toronto, in response to community complaints that the participation of CAFE would \\"directly undermine the participation of queer, lesbian and trans women in the Pride Parade.\\" On August 23 CAFE walked in the Ottawa Pride parade. The Ottawa Sun, which covered their participation, interviewed Tammy Dopson, chair of the community advisory committee, who explained they received \\"no complaints about CAFE participating in the parade this year\\" and went on to say \\"Unless they're practising hate speech, there's no reason to exclude them,\\" said Dopson. \\"Like many other people marching the parade, people agree and disagree.\\" Billboard Campaigns In March 2015, CAFE unveiled a billboard in downtown Toronto, which asserted that \\"half of domestic violence victims are men,\\" and that \\"no domestic violence shelters are dedicated to us.\\" The campaign coincided with International Women's Day, and took place shortly after Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne announced a three- year plan to combat sexual violence. In a news release, CAFE suggested that Wynne's violence against women initiative \\"reinforces sexist stereotypes that ignore violence against men, gays, and lesbians, and endanger children with abusive mothers.\\" In an interview with CBC, Trottier stated that while \\"initiatives to combat violence against women are necessary and praiseworthy,\\" policies \\"should be built on facts rather than bound by ideologies.\\" The National Post noted in its coverage of the campaign that CAFE's claim was based on a Statistics Canada survey from 2009, which found that roughly similar numbers of men and women experienced spousal violence in Canada. The same survey, the Post noted, had also found that women were twice as likely to be injured by spousal violence, three times more likely to be the victims of serious violence, and seven times more likely to fear for their lives. Responding to the billboard campaign, The Globe and Mail writer Leah McLaren wrote that CAFE's stance on the issue was \\"beyond ludicrous,\\" suggesting that the group had a \\"topsy-turvy world view.\\" Responding to the billboard, Todd Minerson of White Ribbon Campaign said that \\"women are more likely to experience violence in an intimate relationship [by] many, many times,\\" adding that \\"women are more likely to experience more severe and, in fact, far more likely to experience fatal violence,\\" Social worker Gary Direnfeld was also critical of the billboard. \\"The way that that is presented is misleading,\\" he said. Acknowledging that \\"there aren't shelters dedicated to men,\\" Direnfeld suggested that \\"the need is so disproportionately greater for women that that is where the bulk of the money goes.\\" Penny Krowitz, who is the executive director of Act to End Violence Against Women was also critical of the billboard. Speaking to the National Post, she said \\"If we had enough men coming forward saying, 'I need shelter from this abusive woman' or 'I need shelter from this situation,' do you not think that we would have provided those services to men?\\" and adding that \\"if service providers were finding that there was such a need for men's shelters, there would be men's shelters,\\" In November 2015, CAFE unveiled a second billboard on the theme of fatherlessness and parental alienation. The image showed a girl being pulled out of the loving arms of her father, with the text \\"I am not parental prey. Help me keep mommy AND daddy.\\"  Indigenous Boys and Men  CAFE has joined calls for Canada's Inquiry Into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women to include boys and men, based on the fact that 70% of murdered indigenous people are men. University of Saskatchewan professor Rob Innes has said that, it \\"might not be the best idea\\" for those wishing to expand the inquiry to include men to ally with CAFE, because \\"as men's rights activists do in general‚Äîthey point towards men being disadvantaged because of feminists.\\" CBC reporter Stephanie Cram, who called CAFE \\"one of the loudest and most controversial voices in so-called men's rights activism,\\" wrote that the group \\"undermined\\" the drive to include men in the inquiry. According to Cram, Trottier's claim that there had already been many inquiries into missing aboriginal women was \\"simply not true.\\" She also cited a 2016 Statistics Canada report, which found that Indigenous women experience double the rate of violent victimization of Indigenous men.  Red Pill film screening  In December 2016, CAFE organized a screening of The Red Pill, a documentary film about the men's rights movement directed by Cassie Jaye, at Ottawa's Mayfair theatre. The Mayfair cancelled the screening following community and advertiser complaints that CAFE was spreading hatred and homophobia on campus, and allegations that the group had been dishonest in its Canada Revenue charity status application. According to the Mayfair's co-owner, the cancellation was followed by a \\"48-hour avalanche of hateful insults,\\" including death threats, from supporters of CAFE and the film. Responding to the intimidation, the theatre's co-owner said \\"If there was an ounce of 'Oh, I'm sorry guys' before, that went away quickly.\\" The film was later shown at Ottawa's City Hall theatre.Other sources: * *  References   External links  * Canadian Association for Equality (Official) Category:Men's rights organizations Category:Charities based in Canada Category:Organizations established in 2010 ","title":"Canadian Association for Equality"},{"id":"39318137","title":"Snooker world rankings 2013/2014"},{"id":"39318148","text":"The name Treaty of Hanover is attached to at least two treaties: * the Treaty of Hanover (1710), an alliance between the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and the Tsardom of Russia in the Great Northern War * the Treaty of Hanover (1725), which established the Hanoverian Alliance, a coalition between the Kingdom of France, the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Habsburg Monarchy and later also several other states ","title":"Treaty of Hanover"},{"id":"39318154","text":"Facid can refer to: * Facid, a trade name for Famotidine * Faculdade Integral Diferencial, a university in Teresina ","title":"Facid"},{"id":"39318155","text":"Katera (, ) is a village in Belarus.

Background On February 11, 1990, Mike Tyson endured an upset loss to James \\"Buster\\" Douglas that cost him the undisputed Heavyweight Championship. Though he had hoped for a rematch, Douglas instead opted to face the number one contender, Evander Holyfield. As such, Tyson was forced to go down the comeback trail. His first opponent was 1984 Olympic Gold Medalist Henry Tillman, who had twice defeated Tyson as an amateur. Tyson easily defeated Tillman, knocking him out at 2:47 in the first round. Tyson's next fight in his comeback was against Alex Stewart, an up-and- coming prospect with all 26 of his wins as a professional coming by way of knockout. He was undefeated through his first 24 fights before falling to a rising Evander Holyfield. Nevertheless, Stewart came into the fight with Tyson with a 26‚Äì1 record and was taken as a more serious opponent for Tyson than the struggling Tillman. Though the fight was originally set for September 22, Tyson suffered a deep cut over his right eye due to an accidental headbutt from sparring partner Greg Page.Tyson Cut Badly in Training, and Bout Is Put Off, N.Y. Times article, 1990-09-01, Retrieved on 2013-05-06. The cut required 48 stitches, causing the fight to be rescheduled for December 8.Tyson's Match Rescheduled, Orlando Sentinel article, 1990-09-08, Retrieved on 2013-05-06. The fight As soon as the match started, Tyson went on the attack and hit Stewart with two right hands, the second of which knocked Stewart to the canvas less than 10 seconds into the fight. Stewart was able to get back up at the count of five and continue the fight, but he was met with a bevy of power punches from Tyson. At 1:05 in the round, Stewart was again knocked down by a right hand from Tyson. This time he got up at the count of eight and referee Frank Cappuccino allowed Stewart to continue. With the three knockdown rule in effect, Tyson would continue his furious assault on Stewart in an effort to get the third knockdown which would give him the automatic victory. At 2:27 in the round, Tyson hit Stewart with a short left hand the knocked Stewart down for the third time, ending the fight and giving Tyson the victory by technical knockout.Fire and Fury, Sports Illustrated article, 1990-12-17, Retrieved on 2013-05-06. Aftermath Tyson, who at the time was the number one contender, would then agree to fight the dangerous number two contender, Donovan \\"Razor\\" Ruddock, with the winner of the fight earning the right to face Holyfield for the Undisputed Heavyweight Championship. Tyson would controversially pick up the victory via 7th round technical knockout after referee Richard Steele stopped the fight despite the fact that Ruddock appeared healthy enough to continue. Because of this, Tyson and Ruddock's camps agreed to a rematch three months later. Tyson would again earn the victory, this time by unanimous decision, but before his planned match with Holyfield could happen, he was charged and subsequently sentenced to six years in prison for rape.

Art unions Art unions were organisations created to function as patrons of art. Members would pay a small annual subscription. The union would spend the subscriptions on works of contemporary art, which were distributed among its members by means of a lottery. The idea emerged in Switzerland at the beginning of the 19th century, and was imitated in various German territories. It was introduced to England in the late 1830s on the recommendation of a House of Commons Select Committee on the Arts and Manufactures in the United Kingdom. Foundation The Art Union of London was established in 1837, following the establishment of similar organisations in Edinburgh and Liverpool. It described its aim as being \\"to aid in extending the love of the Arts of Design, and to give Encouragement to Artists beyond that afforded by the patronage of individuals.\\" Its first meeting was led by four young social radicals: Edward Edwards, Henry Hayward, George Godwin and Lewis Pocock. By the end of the year a formal management committee had been formed, which included the architect Charles Barry, William Ewart MP, chairman of the 1835 select committee, N.W. Ridley Colborne MP, who had also been a member of the select committee and Lord Prudhoe, later Duke of Northumberland. The committee was to prove stable, with nine of the original members were still serving in 1857. In its first year, 1837, the union raised only ¬£480; by 1842, however, annual subscription revenue stood at almost ¬£13,000 a figure that would remain fairly stable for twenty years. By 1876 there were more than 20,000 members. The Union persuaded Samuel Carter Hall, editor of The Art Journal, to publish the Union's documents and reports in his magazine, and to promote the annual exhibition of its prizes. Membership and its benefits Each member paid a subscription of one guinea a year. In return they all received a large engraving annually, said to be at least equal in value to their subscription. In addition they had the chance of winning a prize at a yearly draw, initially either a proof copy of that year's print, or a painting. The committees of earlier art unions had selected the prize works for their members, but the winners of Art Union of London prizes had a free choice of any painting, up to a given value, shown at any of the London exhibitions that year. At a draw held early on in the Union's history, in 1839, there were 62 prizes. They consisted of 20 proof impressions of the annual engraving, twenty impressions on India paper; nine pictures valued at ¬£10, two at ¬£30, four at ¬£50, one at ¬£100 and one at ¬£150. At that year's meeting George Godwin announced the Committee's intention to hold the draw at an earlier date in the future, to allow the winners' selections to be made before most of the best pictures had been sold. The annual engraving was, at least in the early years, selected from amongst the paintings chosen by the prize-winners. As the number of subscribers increased, so did the value of the prizes, totalling about ¬£9,000 annually at the peak of the Union's success. From the 1840s there were yearly exhibitions of the prize selections. In addition to paintings and proof engravings the Art Union of London began to offer various specially manufactured \\"art objects\\" as prizes. In 1842 it launched a series of medals illustrating the history of British art. Thirty of each were cast in silver as prizes, and bronze versions were offered as an alternative to the annual print. In the same year the Union began to offer bronze statuettes as prizes. As a cheaper alternative they developed the idea of issuing sculptures in the unglazed porcelain known as \\"Parian Ware\\"; the first to be issued was John Gibson's Narcissus, produced by Copeland and Garrett in an edition of fifty in 1845 and offered in the following year's draw. The success of the venture led the Union to organise a competition for works that could be reproduced on a small scale in Parian. Dissolution By 1895 the number of subscribers had fallen to below 5,000. The Union was wound up following a resolution passed in 1912.

History The tomb of Ugaas Samatar in Harirad (died: 1812), Ugaas of the Gadabuursi clan. The tomb of Dudub Osman, ancestor of the Reer Dudub (Jibriil Yoonis), Gadabuursi in Harirad. According to legend, the present-day territory of Harirad was covered by trees and a wadi. On their way to Zeila, nomadic pastoralists sometimes stopped in the town to water their flock. The town houses the burial sites for many of the historical figures of the town, among them Ugaas Samatar (died: 1812), of the Reer Ugaas subclan of the Makayl- Dheere, who was the chief of the Gadabuursi clan. Also, buried in the town is Dudub Osman, who is the ancestor of the Reer Dudub branch of the Jibriil Yoonis subclan of the Gadabuursi. The town also hosts a shrine dedicated to the memory of Sheekh Issa, the ancestor of the Issa (clan) clan. Demographics Shrine to commemorate the ancestor of the Issa (clan) clan in Harirad. As of 2012, the population of Harirad has been estimated to be 678. The town inhabitants belong to various mainly Afro-Asiatic-speaking ethnic groups. The town is inhabited by the Reer Dudub subclan of the Jibriil Yoonis and the Bahabar 'Eli subclan of the Mahad 'Ase, both branches of the Gadabuursi Dir clan. The town is also inhabited by the Reer Geedi subclan of the Issa Dir clan. The FSAU Monthly Food Security Report March (2003) states that the Gadabuursi clan are the main local inhabitants of Harirad whilst Issa pastoralists migrate to the region seasonally from Ethiopia: > \\"Following discussions with the Issa (from Ethiopia) and Gadabursi (local > inhabitants) livestock owners and local leaders in Gerissa, Xariradd, Jidhi, > Karuure, Ceel Gal, Zeyla, Lughaye, Kalalwe and Osooli.\\" Geography Harirad is situated in a mountainous area, in an enclosed valley of the highlands. One can also take in the local wildlife, such as the black- backed jackal, dorcas gazelle, caracal, hamadryas baboon and various bird species. Climate The weather in Harirad is semi-arid (K√∂ppen climate classification: BSk). It has a mountain climate, with hot and dry summers and cold winters. This is attributed to the fact that Harirad is located on a plain surrounded by mountains as well as near the sea. The town sits at an altitude of 972 meters above sea level, in low-shrouded mountains and hills.

Its first appearance was in Japan in 1935 and since then, it has appeared in other parts of the world such as the east coast of the USA, Norway, and the English Channel. Description Karenia mikimotoi has yellow-brown chloroplasts and, like other species in its genus, is able to activate photosynthetically. It lacks thecal plates, and is more ovular. Blooms usually form during warmer months. The toxicity of Karenia mikimotoi is not fully understood, whereas other species in Karenia have identified toxins that are shown to kill marine life. For example, Karenia brevis has brevetoxins. It is believed that its killing effects are due to a combination of the creation of an anoxic environment by the physical bloom itself in addition to some sort of toxin. New toxins called gymnocin A and B were recently discovered,Silke, J., et al. Karenia mikimotoi: An exceptional dinoflagellate bloom in western Irish waters, summer 2005. Marine Institute. Marine Environment and Food Safety Services, Galway. November, 2005. Accessed 9 May 2013. but their low toxicity is inconsistent with the high number of deaths Karenia mikimotoi causes. It is believed that in red tides, Karenia mikimotoi fills in the fish‚Äôs gills, thereby allowing direct contact with toxins. This is a more likely approach to the toxin‚Äôs mechanisms. Major appearances In August, 1978, a bloom stretched 100 km eastwards in Roaringwater Bay from Fastnet Rock to Kinsale Harbor in Irish waters. The next year at around the same time, a similar bloom appeared, and again in 1984. These blooms resulted in the deaths of benthic organisms as well as farmed culture and their consistency suggests the water zone between the upwelling open ocean and the more stratified inner bay might be favorable conditions for phytoplankton growth. The English Channel experienced a major bloom in 2003 that traveled from the western English Channel at end of June to the French coast of Brittany at the beginning of August. The density of this bloom was up to 100 mg/m3 whereas it usually only takes 10 mg/m3 to cause noticeable discoloration. In 2005, a major bloom appeared off the west coast of Ireland. Deaths due to the bloom persisted throughout that entire summer. In August, deaths were still being reported. There were reports of dead lugworms and cockles washing up on beaches, as well as unoxygenated sediment beginning to appear due to eliminations in other parts of the ecosystem.

Early life Carroll Pratt was born April 19, 1921, in Hollywood, California to Carroll, Sr., a sound engineer during the early years of sound in films and television, and Edith Pratt (n√©e Holmes), a housewife and homemaker. The Pratt family relocated to Sydney, Australia, where Pratt's father worked on Australia's first film with sound, before returning to the U.S. The junior Pratt soon took an interest in sound engineering as well. After serving in the United States Air Force during World War II, Pratt began working as a sound engineer at MGM Studios. Charley Douglass and Northridge Electronics Pratt met Charley Douglass, inventor of the laugh track while at MGM. Pratt regularly helped Douglass transport the bulky \\"laff box\\" into studios and was eventually added to the payroll of Northridge Electronics, Douglass's company. Douglass trained Pratt in his methods of adding laughter to existing soundtracks. Pratt spent his first two years under Douglass' guidance, laughing up the integrated commercials that television programs used to include, in which the actors of the shows would promote the shows' products sponsors; afterwards, Pratt was assigned to laughing entire programs when Northridge Electronics worked on the Screen Gems shows Bachelor Father (CBS, 1957‚Äì59; NBC, 1959‚Äì61; ABC, 1961-62), Leave it to Beaver (CBS, 1957‚Äì58; ABC, 1958‚Äì63), and Dennis the Menace (CBS, 1959‚Äì63), among others. Due to a spike in business, Douglass hired Pratt's brother, John, as well. Because different editors would react to certain jokes and situations in different ways, producers would put in bids for specific editors to laugh their shows; next to Douglass, the Pratt brothers were the most prolific editors working for Northridge Electronics. Sound One In addition to regular laugh track editing, the Pratt brothers worked in Douglass' workshop during summer hiatuses, building and rebuilding machines. \\"Charley was a great machinist\\", Carroll commented, \\"we were sort of the nuts- and-bolts guys.\\" Carroll and John worked faithfully and devotedly for Douglass, whose technology had become outdated by the mid-1970s. Pratt commented that after years of constant use, Douglass' tapes were beginning to wear out; as a result, hissing sounds were audible, and they knew a laugh was about to be heard by the increase of hissing. Despite efforts to convince Douglass to advance his technology, Douglass himself, while not stubborn, was quite fond of his invention and felt no urge to advance. Pratt constructed a new computerized \\"laff box\\"; the innovative new machine was smaller, simpler to use, and could store recordings on cassette tapes, as opposed to Douglass' 32 magnetic tape loops. The Pratt brothers parted ways with Douglass in 1977, and formed a new company, Sound One. The new company had an immediate edge over Douglass offering stereo recordings that matched the sound quality of stereo programs. Douglass tried to convert previous mono analog recordings to stereo, with mediocre results. Producers were enthused by the ingenuity of Pratt's laugh track, that by 1978, most producers shifted from Douglass' track to Pratt's track for both utilizing and sweetening.Carroll Pratt (June 12, 2003). Emmy TV Legends: Carroll Pratt Interview (Interview with Karen Herman). Philo, California: Archive for American Television. Later years While Douglass' laugh track had been boisterous and hearty, Pratt's laugh track was more subtle and subdued, reflecting a shift in the mindset of viewing audiences. Pratt commented, \\"A joke is a joke, but I've noticed that the public is more sophisticated now. They don't seem to be hand-fed as they were in the early days. Now, we take the light approach as far as trying to drive home a joke with audience reaction. I think that it's okay to back off a little bit especially on a live-audience show. Go with the show and let them tell you.\\" Pratt carried on the audience reaction legacy pioneered by Douglass on not only sitcoms, but live programs such as award shows, game shows, sports programs, specials and pageants. Much like his mentor's company, Sound One was a mostly family business; John continued working with Carroll until 1980, while his wife, Carole, served as the company's accountant. Like Douglass, Pratt also hired additional editors, mentoring and training them on laugh machines, and how to edit laugh tracks on programs. Pratt overheard the writers whispering to one another, \\"Isn't he too old to understand today's humor?\\", which made him realize that writers and producers were getting steadily younger, and as such, the production industry as a whole was also in the hands of younger professionals; because of this, Pratt decided that it was time for him to turn Sound One over to the hands of his younger proteges. Pratt officially retired from managing Sound One in 1989, but continued to consult with other editors, and occasionally laugh up programs until 1995. Death Pratt died of natural causes on November 11, 2010 in Santa Rosa, California at age 89. Personal life While Pratt was working on M*A*S*H, a woman wrote in to producer Gene Reynolds, begging him to stop using a laugh track on the show. Ironically, the woman was Pratt's girlfriend, Carole. The two later married and lived in Malibu, California.

A graduate of George Washington University, Pevner began his literary career in 1991, founding Stephen Pevner, Inc. He quickly began representing some of the most culturally relevant writers/filmmakers of his generation including Gregg Araki, Tom DiCillo, Karen Salmansohn, Richard Linklater and Todd Solondz. In 1995, a then unknown Eve Ensler came to Stephen with a manuscript for what would become known as The Vagina Monologues. Originally created as a book, Pevner helped develop it into a reading. The one-woman play (starring Ensler) opened at Fez Under Time Cafe and then transferred to HERE Arts Center before becoming a global phenomenon. Pevner's success continued later that year when he met Neil LaBute and produced his writing/directing film debut, In The Company of Men starring Aaron Eckhart. Originally made on a budget of $25,000, it went on to gross over $2.8 million. This film won the Filmmaker's Trophy at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival, Independent Spirit Award and New York Film Critics Award for Best First Feature Film. Pevner and LaBute then signed a three-picture deal, with LaBute directing Your Friends & Neighbors starring Ben Stiller, Nurse Betty starring Renee Zellweger, and Possession starring Gwyneth Paltrow. Pevner served as executive producer on all three. Pevner then relocated to New York City in 2003, taking over the reins as impresario behind New York's longest-running and largest underground dance parties via his company The Saint at Large(c). At the helm of these storied and celebrated dance parties, Pevner continues to work with and introduce a stable of the highest caliber musical talent to New York audiences. In 1999, Pevner introduced theater audiences to LaBute as Lead Producer of Bash: Latter-Day Plays (Off-Broadway, LA London). Starring Calista Flockhart, Paul Rudd, Ron Eldard and directed by Joe Mantello, the play was filmed live as a Showtime Presentation (winner of Jury Award for Best Television Movie at Canadian BANFF Awards) and named in the Top 5 Shows of the Year by Time Magazine. In 2003, Pevner produced the smash hit Hollywood send-up, Matt & Ben, written by and starring Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers. With seated productions Off-Broadway, Los Angeles, Chicago and a national tour, the play made Time's Top 10 for 2003. In 2004, Pevner commissioned an original screenplay from a young Columbia Univ. politico, Beau Willimon, on which the play Farragut North is based. Staged to much acclaim at The Atlantic Theater Company and The Geffen Playhouse with Chris Noth and Chris Pine, the production was included in Time's Top 10 for 2008 and has been adapted as a motion picture: The Ides of March with George Clooney directing and starring alongside Ryan Gosling, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Giamatti. Marissa Tomei and Evan Rachael Wood of which Pevner, along with Leonardo DiCaprio, serves as executive producer. The film was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay of 2011 at the 84th Academy Awards. In 2005, Pevner produced the New York City concert debut of Jennifer Hudson at Hammerstein Ballroom. Three years later, he produced the American debut of Euro-pop glamour girl Roisin Murphy. In 2007, Pevner conceived Schwarzwald ‚Äì The Movie You Can Dance To, a motion picture incorporating multi-screen projection, live performance and a continuous dance mix. The film installation continues to screen in film and art festivals and nightclubs around the world. In 2011, Pevner produced Caligula Maximus ‚Äì featuring Kayvon Zand, a musical disco circus showcasing a host of New York's most celebrated nightlife talent. Subsequently, Pevner produced Black Rose Tango, a short film about Rose Wood, called the Sally Bowles of New York's underground cabaret scene. In 2013, Pevner, through his production company The Saint At Large, produced the critically acclaimed Off-Broadway premiere of Nutcracker Rouge, a Baroque, burlesque ballet, at the Minetta Lane Theater which garnered a Drama Desk Nomination for the 2013-2014 Season in the category of Unique Theatrical Experience.

The diary, presented in a special pull-out section of the magazine, drew widespread messages of support and confirmation of the problem, which were printed in the following issue. The messages came not only from teachers, but from pupils too. In the Shropshire Star, it was revealed that the teacher was from Telford, although he wanted to remain anonymous to protect the children at the school. Within weeks, the teacher's identity, Stuart Williams, was discovered by the UK press, with stories in the Sunday People and the Daily Mail, and the school was identified as Lord Silkin School.Sarah Harris, 'My diary of despair', Daily Mail (27 April 2004), 25. He was subsequently interviewed by the Sunday TelegraphIt's parents who make children unteachable, Max Davidson, The Sunday Telegraph review section page 2, 2 May 2004 and Radio Shropshire. Name changes On 1 April 2013 The Lord Silkin School converted to academy status and was renamed \\"Lakeside Academy\\". The school became part of the Telford Co-operative Multi-Academy Trust. The New Academy also came in with a change of uniform, that went into place September 2012. In April 2015, the school failed its Ofsted inspection, and was placed in special measures. Starting in September 2015, the school had a new academy sponsor, the Community Academies Trust, and was renamed \\"Telford Park School\\". The new school buildings (which were started in mid-2013) were opened in September 2015. They include a sports centre, sixth form facility, and a post 16 centre. The old building was demolished in 2015 after the opening of the new Telford Park School.  Anti-bullying policy  Following the April 2014 death at his residence of a 12-year-old pupil whose parents alleged that he had been the victim of bullying, the school stated that it had \\"an anti-bullying policy which includes generic sections for both staff and students [with] the section for students put together by the students themselves\\", and further stated that there are well established procedures for supporting young people at the school.\\" Weekend education The Telford Japanese School („ÉÜ„É´„Éï„Ç©„Éº„ÉâË£úÁøíÊéàÊ•≠Ê†° Teruf≈çdo Hosh≈´ Jugy≈ç K≈ç), a weekend Japanese educational programme, is held at Telford Park School.\\"Home.\\" Telford Japanese School.

Early career Dust Muhammad was born in Herat in the late 15th century, although the date is not known. He was a disciple of KamƒÅl ud-Dƒ´n BehzƒÅd, working with teachers in Herat. Prince Bahram Mirza first spotted his talent and invited him to work in his studio. By early 1520 Doust Muhammad with Behzad moved from Herat to Tabriz. After the death of Shah Ismail I, he remained in the service of Shah Tahmasp I, taking part in the illustration of the famous Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, however his contribution is much more modest than that of Sultan Mohammed or Mir Musavvir. After the death of his teacher, the painter Behzad, he left the Tahmasp court. According to some researchers, by nature Doust Muhammad was a nomad and he could no longer sit in the same spot. In the late 1530s he worked at the court of the ruler of Kabul, Kamran Mirza, brother of the Mughal emperor Humayun. India In 1555, and at the invitation of the Emperor, he traveled to India. By about 1550 he created a miniature on a separate sheet, created by order of the Mughal emperor - \\"The Emperor Humayun and his brothers in a landscape\\". The interior is styled Turkmen Sultan Muhammad, a lot of it taking the form of grotesque mountain elephant and other animals (such grotesque especially loved Shah Tahmasp). The emperor Humayun sitting on some stone likeness of the throne, and in the distance under the trees playing three boys, one of whom the future Emperor Akbar I. Restless nature Doust Muhammad gave him root and in the court of the Mughal emperors - in the early 1560s, is already under Emperor Akbar I, Dust Muhammad left India and returned to Iran, where he lived out the last days in Qazvin. The exact date of his death is unknown. Calligraphy Dust Muhammad learned the art of calligraphy from a master Shadishaha Qasim, a student of the famous calligrapher of Herat Sultan Ali Mashhadi. From the pen of Dust Muhammad came out excellent artistic calligraphic manuscripts and samples. Some of them are presented in the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. For a long time Doust Muhammad was the head of the Safavid royal court of Prince Bahram Mirza, a famous patron of the arts, but also the master of calligraphy, artist, musician and poet. Dust Muhammad also worked for his brother Bahram Mirza - Shah Tahmasp I, and enjoyed the title of \\"Royal calligrapher\\". Dust Muhammad in the first chapter is known as the author of an essay on Persian painting. In the years 1544‚Äì45. He wrote a treatise on calligraphers and artists. This work is extant in the muraqqa of calligraphic designs and miniatures, known as the \\"Album of Bahram Mirza\\", which is stored in the library of the Topkapƒ± Palace Museum in Istanbul. The first nineteen sheets album as a preface is a treatise Dust Muhammad, written by beautiful handwriting, probably belonging to the author. In addition to the Treaty on the album are three more works Dust Muhammad - two miniatures with the caption \\"Master Dust\\" and calligraphic passage, signed \\"Douste-Muhammad Musavvir\\" (the artist). Treatise written in the Persian language, includes an introduction to the origin of the letter, the head of the masters of handwriting \\"ta øliq\\" and \\"nasta ølƒ´q\\", a section on the history of art and its masters, and especially - the information about the court artists and calligraphers of Bahram Mirza. Despite the confusion of mythical and historical names, the history of painting the picture painted by Dust Muhammad, is of considerable interest. His writing provides a clear allusion to the existence of a religious ban images of living beings, and at the same time on the relativity of this prohibition. In his treatise Dust Muhammad does not touch any problems the art of painting, nor any of its equipment. The value of this work lies in the extensive knowledge of the life and work of Persian artists of the 14th to 16th centuries.

His father was a business man. Mworeko was born in Kagonge but attended boarding school from the age of 7 in the district. Mworeko also lived with his father in Ishaka. His father died when Mworeko was finishing elementary school, and his mother when he was 15 years old in junior school; both of his parents died from AIDS‚Äìrelated illnesses. Outing and asylum In October 2009, around the same time Ugandan politician David Bahati was introducing his \\"Kill the Gays\\" Bill, Mworeko, who usually goes by his middle name \\"Moses\\", made his first trip to the United States. The official purpose of his visit was to participate in an HIV/AIDS conference on South Padre Island, Texas. Although that conference was the official purpose given for such a visit, Mworeko had also hoped of \\"finding a U.S. port to shelter him from the homophobic storm back in Uganda.\\" As a gay Ugandan living in the closet in his home country, he was unable to disclose that fact from his country of origin in-light of the political and social climate in Uganda relating to LGBT issues. In November of that year, Mworeko's visa ran-out, but he chose to remain in the U.S. in fear of going back home. From Texas, Mworeko traveled to Washington, D.C., where he participated in a press conference organised by LGBT rights campaign groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, Truth Wins Out, GLAAD, Americans United and others in order to oppose the February 2010 National Prayer Breakfast organised by the Christian organisation The Fellowship Foundation. According to the U.S. based LGBT Magazine Metro Weekly: \\"The Fellowship\\" (aka \\"The Family\\"), are reported to have ties to Bahati and other homophobic elements in Uganda. Bahati was even initially invited to the breakfast.\\" As a result of that, Mworeko joined forces with Truth Wins Out and others in their event \\"The American Prayer\\" in order to protest the ties between The Fellowship and the supporters of the \\"draconian\\" Kill the Gays Bill introduced to Uganda's House of Parliament by Bahati.

In that 2010 interview, Mworeko told O‚ÄôBryan that he was in the United States to attend a HIV/AIDS conference - the same time the \\"Kill the Gays Bill\\" was being introduced in Uganda. He also relayed to O‚ÄôBryan that, in-light of the political and social climate in his country pertaining to LGBT issues, he feared for his life and decided to overstay his visa and sought political asylum in the United States.

History At some point during the Middle Ages, the first H√ºnigen castle was built in Niederh√ºnigen village. A Villa H√ºnigen is mentioned as a settlement in the 12th century in a document from Pope Eugene III, which might include the castle. The Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Senn von M√ºnsingen ruled over the surrounding territory from this castle. Over the following centuries, the village and castle were owned by a number of noble families. However, in the 16th century the medieval water castle outside the village was destroyed in a fire. In 1554, Niklaus von Scharnachtal had a new H√ºnigen Castle built near the mill at Stalden (in what is now Konolfingen). He had the original stones moved from the old castle site to the new site.H√ºnigen Castle website accessed 6 May 2013 In 1588, the Bernese patrician von May family acquired the village and castle, which they occupied until 1922. The von May family also ruled the village until the 1798 French invasion and the creation of the Helvetic Republic. In 1892 C√©sar Ritz acquired a piece of land near the castle from the von May family and founded the Berner Alpen Milchgesellschaft. The factory processed milk from the surrounding fields and sold their products throughout the world. In 1922 the castle was sold to the Evangelisch Gesellschaft des Kantones Bern (Protestant Society of the Canton of Bern) for 193,000 CHF. Under the Gesellschaft, the castle was converted into a spa and hotel. In 1961 a total of 19,546 guests stayed at the hotel. In 1997/98 it was renovated and reopened as the Parkhotel Schloss H√ºnigen. On 1 January 2011 the Gesellschaft sold the castle to the Thurgauer Immobilienunternehmen Lark Hill AG company, who renovated it again. In May 2013 the hotel and conference rooms reopened.

Previously subject to large-scale debate whether the subfamily deserved the familial status, it is now considered one of the largest subfamilies of rove beetles.Newton, A. F., Jr., M. K. Thayer, J.

CRC Press; Boca Raton, Florida. ix + 443 p.James S. Ashe (1947‚Äì2005) Tree of life University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas, USA  Description  The Aleocharinae are generally small to minute beetles, as they can reach a maximum length of about , but usually they are long, with a few species of , among the smallest of beetles. The body is usually slender, often densely and finely punctured; the head is more or less round and the color may be light or dark brown, reddish-brown, or black, sometimes with contrasting colors of red, yellow, and black. Anatomy Because of the size of the subfamily, their anatomy is extremely variable. However, a few key features are shared by all rove beetles. All members have antennae with 10 or 11 segments. The antennal insertion is posterior to a line drawn between the anterior margins of the eyes or anterior to a line drawn between the anterior margins of the eyes. The tarsal segments vary from 2-2-2 to 4-5-5. Distribution and habitat Rove beetles belonging to this subfamily are distributed throughout the world in almost all terrestrial habitats. They are commonly predators in soil communities and leaf litter, frequently inquilines in ant and termite nests or associated with mushrooms and fungi. Ecology This subfamily is common on all terrestrial habitats. It is collected through several methods, including the use of UV light, emergence chambers, sifting, using Berlese organic material, and pitfall traps. The biology of the subfamily is complex. Many species are highly specialized, thus are prone to extinction. Free-living, parasitic, herbivorous, carnivorous, fungivorous, flying, walking, running, swimming, social, and solitary forms are known, but their life histories are almost unknown at the species level. Systematics This subfamily is one of the largest rove beetle subfamilies, containing 52 tribes, over 1000 genera, and over 12000 described species (about 1385 known from North America). This subfamily is a taxonomically difficult groups of beetles.

He became Chief Architect of the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad, later the Erie Railroad, in 1886, where he was responsible for planning and supervising the construction of stations, docks, piers and other structures for the railroad between New York and Chicago. Several stations built in the late 19th century in New Jersey and Upstate New York are attributed to him. As a young man Archer was educated at Amesbury, Massachusetts, and later graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After working in a variety of jobs ‚Äì as an architect apprentice, florist, and woodcarver ‚Äì he moved to New Albany, Indiana, as a bookkeeper for a lumber company. He returned to the east in the early 1880s and worked for the Chief Engineer of the New York & New England Railroad. Later he worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad at Columbus, Ohio. He then worked for the Wilmington & Northern Railroad, until moving to the Erie. Personal life Archer was born in New York City, the son of Stephen Durkee Archer and Mary Magray.

Career Born in Limerick to an Irish father and an English mother, Kelly studied at Limerick CBS, cousin to former Norwich City and Republic of Ireland footballer Phil Kelly. Des Kelly joined hometown club Limerick following youth spells with Hyde Rovers, Fairview and Drogheda United, before joining his cousin Phil's former club Norwich in 1970, where he had spent time on trial. He joined Southend United on trial in October 1971 whilst with Norwich, but never made a first-team appearance for the club. Following his release from Norwich, Kelly joined Colchester United on trial. Kelly signed for Colchester in June 1972 and would go on to make a single Football League appearance for the club. The club's manager at the time was Jim Smith, who had been watching Kelly during a reserve-team game and discovered from the club doctor that Kelly was blind in one eye. An injury to U's first-choice keeper Barry Smith allowed Kelly an opportunity into the first-team. His only league game for Colchester came in a 3‚Äì0 away defeat to Bradford City on 4 November 1972. He would only play once more for Colchester in an FA Cup first round 6‚Äì0 win against Bognor Regis Town on 18 November. Following his release from Colchester, Kelly joined another of his cousin's former clubs, Lowestoft Town. He would later start coaching football at St Benedict's Catholic College in Colchester. From here, he trained to become a teacher in London and landed a job at St John Payne Catholic Comprehensive School in Chelmsford, becoming head of physical education. He taught at St John Payne for 34 years, 20 of those as deputy head teacher, also teaching religious education alongside P.E. In 2010, Kelly was awarded the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice by Pope Benedict XVI for his work in Catholic Education, evangelisation and bereavement in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brentwood.

They are diverse in size and coloration. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The entire family used to be included in the Timaliidae. Characteristics They are small to medium-sized birds. They have strong legs, and many are quite terrestrial. They typically have generalised bills, similar to those of a thrush. Most have predominantly brown plumage, with minimal difference between the sexes, but many more brightly coloured species also exist. This group is not strongly migratory, and most species have short rounded wings, and a weak flight. They live in lightly wooded or scrubland environments, ranging from swamp to near-desert. They are primarily insectivorous, although many will also take berries, and the larger species will even eat small lizards and other vertebrates. Taxonomy The family Leiothrichidae was introduced (as a subfamily Leiotrichanae) by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1832. The title page bears the year 1831 but the volume did not appear until 1832. A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the family published in 2018 led to substantial revision of the taxonomic classification. The laughingthrushes in the genus Garrulax were found to belong to three separate clades that had diverged in the Miocene 7-9 million year ago. The genus was therefore split with Garrulax restricted to one clade and the genera Pterorhinus and Ianthocincla resurrected for the other two clades. The genus Turdoides was also split and species moved into the resurrected genus Argya. In a separate change, the crocias were moved to the genus Laniellus Swainson, 1832 which has priority over Crocias Temminck, 1836. List of genera The family contains 133 species divided into 16 genera: * Grammatoptila ‚Äì monotypic, Striated laughingthrush * Cutia (2 species) ‚Äì cutias * Laniellus (2 species) ‚Äì crocias * Trochalopteron (19 species) ‚Äì laughingthrushes * Actinodura (9 species) ‚Äì barwings and minlas * Montecincla (4 species) ‚Äì laughingthrushes * Minla ‚Äì monotypic, Red-tailed minla * Leioptila ‚Äì monotypic, Rufous-backed sibia * Leiothrix (2 species) * Liocichla (5 species) - liocichlas * Heterophasia (7 species) - sibias * Argya (16 species) ‚Äì species previous placed in Turdoides ‚Äì mainly babblers * Turdoides (19 species) ‚Äì babblers * Garrulax (14 species) ‚Äì laughingthrushes * Ianthocincla (8 species) ‚Äì species previously placed in Garrulax ‚Äì laughingthrushes * Pterorhinus (23 species) ‚Äì species previously placed in Garrulax ‚Äì laughingthrushes and babaxes References Further reading * * Collar, N.

For his work, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in 1999. Life Kingery was born on July 27, 1926 in White Plains, New York, one of four children. His father was a doctor in private practice. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he majored in inorganic chemistry, receiving his BSc in 1948. A professor at MIT, Frederick Harwood Norton, gave Kingery a stipend to remain at MIT and work on his PhD. Norton had been at MIT since 1939. He was a specialist in refractory materials, materials that retain their strength at high temperatures. He had published the standard textbook on the subject, Refractories. Kingery later described him as a \\"gifted ceramic sculptor\\" and also credited him with creating, in the Metallurgy Department at MIT, \\"the first interdisciplinary ceramic science program anywhere.\\" Kingery took two years to complete a thesis on the chemical phosphate bonding of refractories and obtained his PhD in 1950. In 1951, he became a member of the faculty at MIT. When Kingery began working on ceramics, it was a collection of technologies that he later described as \\"akin to a craft industry\\". Each type of ceramic - including heavy clays (used for building), refractories, glass, pottery and porcelain - had its own subculture and empirical methods. Kingery built a theoretical foundation for ceramics on solid state physics and crystallography, creating a new field called physical ceramics. He developed quantitative models for the properties of ceramics; and to test them, made advances in the methods of measuring properties such as thermal conductivity. He contributed greatly to methods for processing ceramics, particularly sintering, a method for creating objects out of powders by heating them until they bond. He wrote a series of books on ceramics, culminating in Introduction to Ceramics, a book that became the \\"founding treatise\\" for ceramics. Kingery became a full professor in 1962. In 1987 he left MIT for The Johns Hopkins University, and in 1988 joined the University of Arizona as Professor of Anthropology and Materials Science. In the departments of Anthropology and Materials Science and Engineering, he established an interdisciplinary program in Culture, Science and Technology. Among the students he advised was W. Patrick McCray (Ph.D., 1996) who is now a professor of the history of science and technology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Kingery and his wife renovated an 18th-century cottage in Rhode Island, which they used as a summer home. An active ocean sailor, he made a single-handed voyage to Bermuda in 1975, and subsequently organized the Marion-Bermuda Yacht Race, an event that has occurred every two years since 1977. He also sailed across the Atlantic for a sabbatical in France and across the Pacific to Tahiti and to the Marquesas Islands, the site of Herman Melville's book Typee. Other interests included horse riding and flying a Piper aircraft. Kingery died of a heart attack at the age of 73. Awards In 1975, Kingery became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. In 1980 he gave the Edward Orton Jr. Memorial Lecture, \\"Social needs and ceramic technology\\", to the American Ceramic Society. In 1983 he became a Distinguished Life Member of the society. In 1984 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. From 1989 to 1993, he was chairman of the Board of Trustees for the Academy of Ceramics. In 1992 the society gave him the Outstanding Ceramic Educator Award; and in 1998 it established the W. David Kingery Prize, with him as the first recipient. In 1999 the Inamori Foundation awarded him the Kyoto Prize for ‚ÄúFundamental Contribution to Development of the Ceramics Science and Technology Based on the Physicochemical Theory‚Äù. The prize came with $400,000. In the citation for the prize, he was called the \\"father of modern ceramics\\".

Career The son of Count Tullio Ginanni Corradini (who was also mayor of Ravenna) and brother of Arnaldo Ginna (the names Corra and Ginna were suggested by Giacomo Balla by assonance with the words running and gymnastics), he spent his childhood and most of the youth in the hometown, adding to the more regular studies work with anarchists, dealing with all the learning, literature, art, philosophy, theosophy. At the end of 1912 he founded with Mario Carli and Emilio Settimelli the magazine The Centaur, which aimed at the expression of a non-dogmatic conception of art. In 1916, he participated in the making of the film Futurist Life, in collaboration with Balla and Marinetti, a film produced and directed by Ginna (now for this film there are only a few frames). In 1915 he published the novel Sam Dunn is dead, (Sam Dunn √® Morto). He left Futurism a few years after the end of the First World War, publishing novels and escapist comedies that got a decent success with the public, such as The Island of Kisses of 1918, written in cooperation with Marinetti, or The Passatore of 1929 (on Stefano Pelloni).

It is the fourteenth core product in the Tales series and was developed and published by Bandai Namco Games. The game was localized for North America and Europe in August 2014. The game takes place after Tales of Xillia and follows Ludger Will Kresnik; the Kresnik family has the ability to infiltrate and destroy parallel dimensions. Since the spirit Origin is unable to support the abundance of souls, a famous company hires Ludger to destroy these dimensions to keep the world in balance. The game's central theme is . Gameplay Tales of Xillia 2 consists primarily of two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed in the form of a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs. During battle sequences, the game uses the Cross Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System, a similar system to the prequel. Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand. The enemy mob's number, appearances and behavior vary and are dependent on the mob's avatar. Both sides' objective is to deplete the other side's health points (HP) using attacks and skills. When a party member's health falls to zero, the party member faints until revived with items, by a healer, or resting at an inn on the field map; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena. Killing all the mobs will yield experience points, items, and allows the player to return to the field map. If all four participating party members are defeated, a game over will occur. Battles take place in real-time. Player actions include moving, dashing, standard attacks, and artes; artes are special attacks which consume \\"Technical Points\\" (TP), the in-game synonym for magic points. Dashing, standard attacks, and artes usage are also restricted by the \\"Assault Counter\\" (AC), a synonym for action points. Party members are able to link to each other to perform unified attacks called linked artes. While linked, the supporting partner provides unique abilities to the character, while also increasing the Linked Artes Gauge. When the Linked Artes Gauge is full, the player character can enter Over Limit which gives them immunity to stagger, unlimited AC, and allows them to use linked artes in succession. Plot The game takes place a year after Tales of Xillia. Under orders from her father to find the mystical Land of Canaan, Elle Mel Marta boards a train which is hijacked before its departure. Ludger Will Kresnik follows her onboard and works with Jude Mathis to retake the train. The train crashes and the resulting medical treatment from Spirius Corporation puts Ludger in debt. Aware of the Kresnik family's ability to destroy parallel dimensions, Spirius CEO, Bisley Karscy Bakur, hires Ludger for this purpose since the spirit Origin can no longer sustain the abundance of souls in the worlds. At the same time, Ludger searches for his brother, Julius Will Kresnik, who has been declared the train hijacking's instigator. As Ludger works for Spirius, he is joined by the protagonists from Tales of Xillia in addition to Gaius and Muz√©t. It is slowly revealed that the world's current predicament is a millennia aged trial arranged by the spirits Origin, Maxwell, and Chronos, as a test on whether humanity was worth preserving. The first person to reach the Land of Canaan will have a wish granted by Origin. As part of the trial, Chronos gave the Kresnik their powers called Chromatus; overusing the Chromatus turns the user into a divergence catalyst which is the core of a parallel dimension. If the number of dimensions reach a million, Origin will release a miasma which will kill everything but spirits. In addition, a special Kresnik is born every generation with the power to take items from parallel dimensions and is dubbed the Key of Kresnik. To reach Canaan, a Key of Kresnik must obtain five objects, called Waymarkers, from parallel dimension. Having used Elle's Key of Kresnik powers, Ludger is able to gather four Waymarkers. In search of the final Waymarker, the party learns that Elle originates from a parallel dimension and her father, Victor, is a Waymarker and that dimension's Ludger. Victor tries to kill Ludger to replace him in the prime dimension but is killed instead. With all five Waymarkers gathered, the entrance to Canaan is revealed. Bisley takes Elle with him to Canaan, intending to use Origin's wish to enslave spirits. With Julius' sacrifice, the party follows and defeats Bisley. The party uses Origin's wish to destroy all parallel dimensions and Ludger is given a choice resulting in two endings: If Ludger does nothing, Elle's transformation into a divergence catalyst causes her to disappear with the other dimensions. Years later, Ludger is the CEO of Spirius and meets Lara Mel Marta during a business deal. If Ludger offers his life to save Elle's, Ludger disappears with the other dimensions. Years later, an adult Elle highlights the party's accomplishments. Development and release On May 9, 2012, Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump announced a Tales game will be revealed on June 2, 2012. On May 14, 2012, Bandai Namco Games opened a website counting down to the reveal. Hideo Baba described the game as more modernized than past games and the phrase \\"Are you prepared to destroy the world for the girl?\\" as a tie to the game's plot. On the reveal date, Tales of Xillia 2 was revealed along with its new characters and battle system. The game will also have a bundle with a specially designed DualShock 3. The day after, the official site revealed the game's central theme is revealed to be . On June 27, 2012, Baba announced the game's release date for November 1, 2012 during a live broadcast. On July 18, 2012, Baba stated there were no Western localization plans at the time but expressed interest in localizing the game to complement with the prequel's English localization. Between August 1 and 7, Bandai Namco Games hosted a survey on Famitsu to determine which version of the game's demo will be playable at an event. On September 23, 2012, the games theme song is revealed to be \\"Song 4 U\\" by Ayumi Hamasaki. On July 6, 2013, a localization for North America and Europe was announced. The localization was announced to be released on August 19 and 22 in North America and Europe, respectively. Conception The concept for Tales of Xillia 2 originated during the development of the original Xillia, but did not enter active development, instead undergoing extensive conceptual work in preparation for production should it be called for. Active development began in 2011, after Xillia was completed. The game was the first mainline Tales title to be developed by Bandai Namco Studio, a studio founded as an in- house development environment after Namco Tales Studio was absorbed into its parent company in 2011. Baba conceived the game's plot while thinking about Tales of Xillias plot and imagined what the history and aftermath of Xillia was like. Because a large proportion of the world and lore of Xillia had only been referred to in speech or text, the decision was made to create a sequel, with a central theme inspired by the choices that must be made by people in both casual and dire situations. A choice mechanic was implemented to help players form a deeper connection with Ludger. Several concepts for alternate timelines went unused, and the original plot differed substantially from that in the final product. The script was handled by multiple writers: Naoki Yamamoto, who had handled Xillias side events, wrote the main scenario. Daisuke Kiga, Xillias main scenario writer, handled the character scenarios. Other writers also contributed to add to the variety of the script. A silent protagonist was chosen so the main character would feel like a full extension of the player. Ludger's transforming abilities and debt needed to be created through cooperation between the writers and designers. Downloadable content Tales of Xillias downloadable content is usable in Tales of Xillia 2. Aside from the prequel's content, Tales of Xillia 2 offers new costumes for the playable characters. A preorder bonus for the game is a costume of Emil Castagnier for Ludger. The first print of the game contains a Yuri Lowell costume for Jude and an Asbel Lhant costume for Milla. On the game's release date, a Code Geass costume set was made available. On November 8, a hairstyle and a sports theme set were made available. On November 15 there were four sets of DLC released: a Puella Magi Madoka Magica costume set for Milla, Elize, and Leia; A school themed set and a swimsuit set were released for Ludger, Gaius, and Muz√©t; and a set of doll attachments were released. On November 22, a Tales set for Ludger, Gaius, and Muz√©t were released to make them resemble other characters from the Tales series. On the same day, a hat set and an additional set of doll attachments were released. Media adaptations Manga Tales of Xillia 2 spawned four manga adaptions: two anthology series and two traditional manga series. The first anthology series is by Ichijinsha with two volumes released in February 2013 and January 2014. The second is by DNA Media Comics which released a volume in March 2013. The Tales of Xillia 2 manga series is an adaption of the game's storyline. Its prelude was published in the December 2012 issue of Viva Tales of Magazine. It began serialization in Dengeki Maoh beginning January 2013. The series is published by ASCII Media Works. It takes place between the first and second Xillia games and follows Jude and Alvin. Books Tales of Xillia 2 had three different strategy guides published; one each from Yamashita Books, Shueisha, and Enterbrain. The book was released by Yamashita Books and details the in-universe information of the game. It was released on March 2, 2013. was published by Bandai Namco Games and Yamashita Books. It details the in-game plot and acts as a guide. Audio CDs A drama CD called by Frontier Works was released in January 2014. was released by Avex Group on November 2, 2012 in a regular and limited edition. It peaked 87th on Oricon's charts. Reception Tales of Xillia 2 was received with generally positive reviews, albeit usually lower than its precessor. It sold half a million copies in Japan and failed to meet Namco Bandai Game's target sales. Famitsu's review of the game was positive and commented on how the game will meet expectations of fans of the series. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, calling it a \\"well- designed RPG bursting with content.\\" It was also well received in western releases.

Lentivirus are a family of viruses that are responsible for notable diseases like AIDS, which infect by inserting DNA into their host cells' genome. Many such viruses have been the basis of research using viruses in gene therapy, but the lentivirus is unique in its ability to infect non-dividing cells, and therefore has a wider range of potential applications. Lentiviruses can become endogenous (ERV), integrating their genome into the host germline genome, so that the virus is henceforth inherited by the host's descendants. To be effective in gene therapy, there must be insertion, alteration and/or removal of host cell genes. To do this scientists use the lentivirus' mechanisms of infection to achieve a desired outcome to gene therapy.  Lentivirus  Structure of a virion of HIV, a type of lentivirus. A membrane with protruding glycoproteins surrounds a capsid containing enzymes and the viral RNA genome. To understand the capabilities of a lentiviral vector, one has to consider the biology of the infection process. The lentivirus is a retrovirus, meaning it has a single stranded RNA genome with a reverse transcriptase enzyme. Lentiviruses also have a viral envelope with protruding glycoproteins that aid in attachment to the host cell's outer membrane. The virus contains a reverse transcriptase molecule found to perform transcription of the viral genetic material upon entering the cell. Within the viral genome are RNA sequences that code for specific proteins that facilitate the incorporation of the viral sequences into the host cell genome. The \\"gag\\" gene codes for the structural components of the viral nucleocapsid proteins: the matrix (MA/p17), the capsid (CA/p24) and the nucleocapsid (NC/p7) proteins. The \\"pol\\" domain codes for the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. Lastly, the \\"env\\" domain of the viral genome encodes for the glycoproteins and envelope on the surface of the virus. There are multiple steps involved in the infection and replication of a lentivirus in a host cell. In the first step the virus uses its surface glycoproteins for attachment to the outer surface of a cell. More specifically, lentiviruses attach to the CD4 glycoproteins on the surface of a host's target cell. The viral material is then injected into the host cell's cytoplasm. Within the cytoplasm, the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme performs reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome to create a viral DNA genome. The viral DNA is then sent into the nucleus of the host cell where it is incorporated into the host cell's genome with the help of the viral enzyme integrase. From now on, the host cell starts to transcribe the entire viral RNA and express the structural viral proteins, in particular those that form the viral capsid and the envelope. The lentiviral RNA and the viral proteins then assemble and the newly formed virions leave the host cell when enough are made.  Use as a vector  One method of gene therapy involves modifying a virus to act as a vector to insert beneficial genes into cells. Unlike other retroviruses, which cannot penetrate the nuclear envelope and can therefore only act on cells while they are undergoing mitosis, lentiviruses can infect cells whether or not they are dividing. Many cell types, like neurons, do not divide in adult organisms, so lentiviral gene therapy is a good candidate for treating conditions that affect those cell types. Some experimental applications of lentiviral vectors have been done in gene therapy in order to cure diseases like Diabetes mellitus, Murine haemophilia A, prostate cancer, chronic granulomatous disease, and vascular diseases. Therapy requires manipulation of the lentivirus genes and structure for delivery of specific genes to alter the course of the disease. Parts of the viral genome must be removed so that the virus can't replicate itself. It is replaced with a gene to permanently incorporate into the host cell's genome using genetically modified virus. HIV-derived lentiviral vectors have been used for introducing libraries of complementary DNAs, short hairpin RNAs, and cis-regulatory elements into many targets, including embryonic stem cells.  Applications   Vascular transplants  In a study designed to enhance the outcomes of vascular transplant through vascular endothelial cell gene therapy, the third generation of Lentivirus showed to be effective in the delivery of genes to moderate venous grafts and transplants in procedures like coronary artery bypass. Because the virus has been adapted to lose most of its genome, the virus becomes safer and more effective in transplanting the required genes into the host cell. A drawback to this therapy is explained in the study that long-term gene expression may require the use of promoters and can aid in a greater trans-gene expression. The researchers accomplished this by the addition of self-inactivating plasmids and creating a more universal tropism by pseudotyping a vesicular stomatis virus glycoprotein.  Chronic Granulomatous Disease In chronic granulomatous disease immune functioning is deficient as a result of the loss of nicotinomide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH_oxidase) in phagocyte cells, which catalyzes the production of superoxide free radicals. If this becomes deficient, the phagocytes can't kill effectively the engulfed bacrteria, so granulomas can be formed. Study performed in mice emphasizes the use of lineage-specific lentiviral vectors for the production of NADP. Scientists developed this strain of lentivirus by transinfecting 293T cells with pseudotyped virus with the vesicular stomatitis G protein. The viral vector's responsibility was to increase the gene synthesis and production of NADP in these phagocytic cells. They did this to create an affinity for myeloid cells.  Prostate cancer  With prostate cancer, the Lentivirus is transformed by being bound to trastuzumab to attach to androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant C4-2 human prostate cancer cell lines. These two cells are primarily responsible for secretion of excess human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), which is a hormone linked to prostate cancer. By attaching to these cells and changing their genomes, the Lentivirus can slow down, and even kill, the cancer-causing cells. Researchers caused the specificity of the vector by manipulating the Fab region of the viral genome and pseudotyped it with the Sindbis virus.  Haemophilia A  Haemophilia A has also been studied in gene therapy with a lentiviral vector in mice. The vector targets the haematopoietic cells in order to increase the amount of factor VIII, which is affected in haemophilia A. But this continues to be a subject of study as the lentivirus vector was not completely successful in achieving this goal. They did this by trans-infecting the virus in a 293T cell, creating a virus known as 2bF8 expressing generation of viral vectors.  Rheumatoid arthritis  Studies have also found that injection of a lentiviral vector with IL-10 expressing genes in utero in mice can suppress, and prevent, rheumatoid arthritis and create new cells with constant gene expression. This contributes to the data on stem cells and in utero inoculation of viral vectors for gene therapy. The target for the viral vector in this study, were the synovial cells. Normally functioning synovial cells produce TNFŒ± and IL-1.  Diabetes mellitus  Like many of the in utero studies, the lentiviral vector gene therapy for diabetes mellitus is more effective in utero as the stem cells that become affected by the gene therapy create new cells with the new gene created by the actual viral intervention. The vector targets the cells within the pancreas to add insulin secreting genes to help control diabetes mellitus. Vectors were cloned using a cytomegalovirus promoter and then cotransinfected in the 293T cell.

He was born in Ravenna, 7 May 1890; he died in Rome, 26 September 1982. Biography The son of Count Tullio Ginanni Corradini (who was also mayor of Ravenna) and brother of Bruno Corra (Ginna and Corra names were suggested by Giacomo Balla by assonance with the words gym and run), studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Ravenna, and graduated in Florence. He focused on the occult sciences, theosophy and Eastern philosophies. In 1910 he published a book with his brother entitled Method and New Life. He theorized about a future non-figurative painting with chromatic music, i.e. translation of feelings and moods in sound and color. An important moment in his artistic research was the early meeting with the Futurist group. This occurred in Milan, in the house of Tommaso Marinetti. This Futurist group included Boccioni, Carr√† and Russolo. Unlike that group, which was interested in the dynamic aspect of painting, he developed a propensity to a painting of pure color, with strong spiritualistic inflections. Between 1910 and 1912 he worked with Corra on some short abstract films, using the color directly on the untreated film. These cinepitture, consisting of overlapping colorful dots, were a commentary on the musical works of Mendelssohn symphonies and abstract compositions to avant-garde. He participated in the Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture in 1912 at the company's Belle Arti in Florence, showing the works Neurasthenia (1908) and Romantic walk (1909). In April 1914, he participated in the Free Futurist International Exhibition, held at the Galleria Sprovieri in Rome. In 1915 he published the text painting of the future and with Corra, the synthesis theatrical Alternation of character in the Futurist Synthetic Theatre of Marinetti, Corra and Settimelli. Up residence in Florence, in addition to true artistic, tried her hand in both theoretical writing treatises on the costume and the occult, political texts and narrative. In 1916 he produced and directed the film Futurist Life, in collaboration with Corra, Balla and Marinetti. However, there now exist only a few frames of this film. In 1919 he published the presurrealista The locomotives with stockings, with a preface by Corra and designs proprietary and pink rose. In the same year he participated in the Great National Exhibition of Futurist Milan, Genoa and Florence. From 1918 to 1920 he collaborated with the magazine Futurist Rome. In the 1920s and 1930s he collaborated with Empire and with Today and Tomorrow. In 1927 he directed the magazine of natural medicine The New. Later he collaborated with the magazine Futurism of Somenzi, which was published in his book pointing Man future. In 1937 he published The idea presentista. In 1938 he signed the manifesto with Marinetti Cinematography. When the futurist period ended, he continued to paint in his abstract genre-occultist, continuing to devote himself to painting until the 1960s. He also collaborated in numerous publications as an art critic and film.

In 2000, just before the dot-com bubble burst, Ager-Hanssen chose to divest his shares in the joint venture with the Pension Fund. The profit from the divestment was used to fuel his investment activities. The National Pension Fund was not so lucky with the timing and lost more than MSEK 350 on the investment. Their lack of competence was criticized lengthily in the Swedish press. The Fund tried to escape the spotlight by blaming Ager-Hanssen. The story was front-page news in all major Swedish newspapers. Later the same year, NetSys Technology Group was valued to more than MUSD 388. Cognition In 1998, Ager-Hanssen founded a Venture Capital company called Cognition where he organized most of his internet- related investment. He employed several high profile individuals. Employees included Ulf Sundqvist, former trade minister in Finland and Gillian Nott, a former financial service authority director, among others. As non-executive chairman he appointed Ron Sandler who was the former Lloyd's of London chief executive and also a former NatWest executive. Sandler commented on the appointment in Financial Times: \\"When I went to NatWest six months ago, the world looked like a certain world. Now it has changed substantially,\\" he said. \\"In contrast to companies like Cognition, old financial services megaliths appear very slow-moving and quite bureaucratic.\\" Cognition was valued by HSBC in beginning of 2000 at approximately 1 Billion GBP and planned for an initial public offering (IPO) on London Stock Exchange. The company never floated because of the dot-com bubble., Financial Times.

Swedish Metro was the original disrupter in the media Industry and the world‚Äôs first free newspaper launched as early as 1995. Metro is today the biggest newspaper in Sweden. The company has interests in music, fashion, recruitment, health, E-sport, and loyalty programs. At the time of the acquisition, Ager-Hanssen was quoted \\"All of Metro‚Äôs business culture is based on surprising the market and doing business that shake up the industry, this fits perfectly with our ambitions in the media sector\\" = Johnston Press Plc = In August 2017 it was reported that Ager-Hanssen had acquired a strategic stake in the 250-year-old publisher Johnston Press plc with the plans to use their digital assets in the same way as Metro, bartering exposure online for equity in startups.thumb Johnston Press plc owns titles such as I (The I newspaper is a national newspaper in United Kingdom. It represents 20% of the quality news in the country.), The Yorkshire Post and The Scotsman. Johnston Press is a leading multimedia business in UK with news brands that reach national, regional, and local audiences. The Group have a portfolio of hundreds of publications and websites. Ager-Hanssen revealed his plan to use Johnston Press' audience of more than 32 million people to help kick-start new ventures. In October 2017 it was reported that activist investor Ager-Hanssen had become the biggest shareholder in Johnston Press plc and that he planned to oust the board and the CEO. Alex Salmond former first minister in Scotland was, according to the press, lined up to become chairman of Johnston Press in an audacious plan to shake up its board. Ager-Hanssen demanded new management, more investment in journalism and a revamped digital strategy.  Dead hand proxy  The attempted boardroom coup at Johnston Press was thwarted by a controversial ‚Äúpoison pill‚Äù defense. Ager-Hanssen branded Johnston Press‚Äô dead hand proxy as ‚Äúa grotesque abuse of fiduciary duty.‚Äù Johnston Press is believed to be the first example of an activist coming up against such a poison pill in the UK. Ager-Hanssen commented on the poison pill in The Telegraph: 'The poison pill cynically deprives shareholders of their fundamental right to change the board as they see fit. That power has been stolen from them. This is nothing short of corporate theft of power in which only the directors can decide who replaces them. The board seeks to play shareholder and bondholder interests off of one another in the hope that the balance of power can remain in the hands of a few cozy fat cats.\\" In the beginning of May 2018, the CEO of Johnston Press, Ashley Highfield stepped down and Ager-Hanssen declared that he now would increase his stake in the 250-year-old publisher. Airline and leisure industry In 2005 Ager- Hanssen and Porter invested together in the airline and travel industry. They acquired, among others, a controlling stake in the close-to-bankrupt publicly listed company FlyMe Europe AB (FLY-B.SK). FlyMe Europe was a low-cost carrier based in Gothenburg with an aim to become one of the leading low-cost carriers in Europe. , GP - Sterling-och-Maersk-nya-partners?., Dagens N√¶ringsliv - Ager-Hanssen flyr igjen, Dagens Industri - Kuppmakere, Hegnar.no - Fly med Ager-Hanssen FlyMe Boeing 737‚Äì500. = FlyMe Europe = Ager-Hanssen and Porters first step in achieving their goal to become a leading low-cost carrier in Europe were to convince the owner of the biggest Danish carrier Sterling European Airlines A/S and Maersk Air, Icelandic Billionaire Palmi Haraldsson, to join their plan. Haraldsson agreed and acquired a strategic holding in FlyMe Europe. Haraldsson had already invested MDKK 500 in Sterling European Airlines and an undisclosed amount in Maersk Air and Iceland Express and saw an opportunity to bring it all together in a listed holding company such as FlyMe Europe. Having together secured a majority stake and voting control in FlyMe they changed the board and raised MSEK 272 to fuel FlyMe Europe's international expansion and to position the company for the consolidation in the airline industry., Dagens Industri - Islansk Milijard√¶r med smak f√∂r svenska f√∂retag , Nettavisen - FlyMe to the moon = Low-cost Carrier Consolidation = In late 2005, Haraldsson accepted an offer from FL Group to divest his holding in Sterling Airlines (the merged entity of Sterling European Airlines and Maersk) for DKK 1.5 Billion.

Easyjet, Airbus. Global Supply Systems Boeing 747‚Äì400. The decision not to acquire Sterling disturbed Haraldsson and Sm√°rason's take-over plan and they got terribly upset. The decision not to acquire Sterling made it impossible for Ager-Hanssen/Porter to continue a business relationship with Haraldsson and in September 2006 they acquired Haraldsson's shares in FlyMe Europe. This led to a battle between the airlines with no winners. The battle was described in detail in the press. , E24, Nordman i svensk fykamp, Hegnar.no - Nordman vant svensk flykamp, Privataaffarer - √Ñgarturbulens-s√§nkte-Flyme , Dagens N√¶ringsliv - G√•r for Jumbo, Sydsvenskan - Norrman ny huvud√§gare i Flyme, Helsingborgs Blad - Norrman ny huvud√§gare i Flyme Both airlines later went bankrupt because the owners would not support the companies with additional capital. = Global Supply Systems = Ager-Hanssen and Porter also had a controlling stake in the English-based freight operator Global Supply Systems (GSS). GSS was launched in 2001 as a British all-cargo carrier whose principal business was providing aircraft on long-term leases to other airlines on an ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, Insurance) basis. Global Supply Systems was a joint venture with Atlas Air Worldwide. Atlas Air operates the world's largest fleet of modern Boeing 747 all-cargo aircraft and was a 49% partner in GSS. In 2007 Porter and Ager-Hanssen's GSS signed a 5-year contract with British Airways (BA) which at the time was described as the largest-ever freighter investment made by BA with total operating costs of over $1 billion.

OSIRIS is one of two instruments on the Odin satellite, launched February, 2001 (the other instrument being a sub-mm radiometer) into a sun-synchronous, 6 pm/6 am local time orbit at 600 km. This restricts OSIRIS sunlit observations to the Northern hemisphere in May, June, July August and the Southern hemisphere in November, December, January and February. Global coverage from 82¬∞S to 82¬∞N occurs on the months adjoining the equinoxes. OSIRIS measurements began November, 2001 and continue to the present. Objectives *Stratospheric ozone science: To elucidate the geographical extent of, and mechanisms responsible for, ozone depletion in the \\"ozone hole\\" region and to study dilution effects and possible heterogeneous chemistry even outside of the polar regions due to sulphate aerosols. *Coupling of atmospheric regions: To study some of the mechanisms that provide coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere, e.g., downward transport of NO with its effects on ozone photochemistry and the vertical exchange of minor species such as odd oxygen, CO, and H2O. Instrument The OSIRIS spectrograph measures from 274 nm to 810 nm with a single line of sight that is scanned through a range of tangent altitudes. Each scan typically ranges from 7 km to 65 km and takes 40 seconds to acquire. The measurements are used to produce height profiles of O3, NO2, and stratospheric aerosols. The Odin satellite was operated until June 2007 as a joint mission between astronomy and aeronomy disciplines. 50% of the total observation time was dedicated to each discipline where time was split into 1 day segments. Odin has operated as a purely aeronomy mission since June, 2007, and continues to the present, with almost complete coverage. OSIRIS is a Canadian instrument, operated by the Canadian Space Agency. The mission PI is Dr. Doug Degenstein, University of Saskatchewan. Odin is operated by the Swedish Space Corporation, with funds from the European Space Agency as a Third Party Mission.

In this painting over 4 meters wide, nineteen men are portrayed, each wearing a sash in the color of his \\"rot\\", or brigade. All three brigades of the St George militia are represented, with their flag-bearers carrying flags in the colours orange, white or blue. These officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the commander's staff situated third from lower left with the orange sash and orange feather in his hat is the Colonel Johan Claesz Loo, who heads the militia. The other officers are carrying partisans with tassles (captains), spontoons (lieutenants) or halberds (sergeants). The men featured in the foreground are from left to right Ensign Lambert Woutersz (with orange flag), Sergeant Gabriel Loreyn, Colonel Johan Claesz Loo, Lieutenant Francois Woutersz, Captain Michiel de Wael, Lieutenant Cornelis Coning, Captain Florens van der Hoeff, Captain Nicolaes Grisz Grauwert, Sergeant Lucas van Tetterode, Captain Quirijn Jansz Damast, Ensign Dirck Dicx (with blue flag), and Ensign Pieter Schout (with white flag). The men in the background are from upper left, Sergeant Pieter de Jong, Frans Hals (self-portrait), Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn, Lieutenant Hendrik Gerritsz Pot, Sergeant Nicolaes van Loo, Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken, and Lieutenant Hendrick Coning. Though a member of the militia, Frans Hals was never assigned the rank of an officer, though he was clearly admired as an important local artist, as was his fellow portraitist Pot, also portrayed in the rear lineup (and who features in two schutterstukken for the other militia in town - the St Adriansdoelen, or Cluveniers). Historians have speculated whether the self-portrait is indeed Hals, or another absent officer (none of the schutterstukken Hals painted were complete representations of all officers; the men paid for their portraits and some men \\"skipped\\" a painting). By the time Hals painted this painting, he had been a soldier of the guard for 25 years, and it had been 23 years since he completed his first schutterstuk for this militia, a highly unusual length of time between commissions for any artist of his time. Artist lineup? Besides showing local painters Hals and Pot, two other men in the rear lineup were relatives of local painters; Lieutenant Cornelis Coning was an engraver, Ensign Jacob Druyvesteyn was the son of Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn, and Sergeant Abraham Cornelisz van der Schalcken was the father of Cornelis Symonsz van der Schalcke, who some say painted the original landscape in this painting, though this was partially overpainted in 1702. This was done by local artist Dirk Maas, whose overpainting may have been meant to honor the local artist- architect Pieter Post. Another artist featured in this painting in the foreground is Quirijn Jansz Damast, a respected designer of fine-woven linen, whose work also featured in the tablecloth of Hals' first work for the militia, The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1616. St. Jorisdoelen View of the rear entrance to the garden of the St. Jorisdoelen.

The building in this painting has puzzled historians, because the St. Jorisdoelen do not look like this building. Instead, the building portrayed looks like Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg. In 1706, the colonel of the St. Jorisdoelen at that time was Pieter Schatter, who was also member of the board of the Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland.

Possibly the size of this painting meant that some of them had to be moved to the narrow rear entrance, which is perhaps how some of them were damaged. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the Frans Hals Museum.

History Gandhi Bookstores were founded in June 1971, by Mauricio Achar. He created the bookstore in the belief that a great amount of the country's problems were due to the lack of reading by its population. The name of the bookstore is because of Mahatma Gandhi and his influence; Achar wanted to do the same. The original store occupied 150 square meters, and was located at Miguel √Ångel de Quevedo 128, south of Mexico City. Even though it was small, the store had a cafeteria of its own, where people would gather not just to read, but to have cultural activities like watching movies, theatre plays, listen to music, etc. These were the basic things that interested people into going more often to the bookstore. Stores Today, there are 34 different Gandhi Bookstores; 17 are located within Mexico City and 17 in other parts of the country. One store is located inside El Palacio de Hierro in the country's capital, and more exist in select Walmart Supercenters.

The only remaining store in operation is a Giant Eagle supermarket. In 2016, the entirety of the mall was demolished, except for the Giant Eagle/Kmart building. History Kossman Development opened Parkway Center Mall on November 4, 1982. Original anchor stores included Gold Circle, Giant Eagle, Zayre, Thrift Drug, and a David Weis catalog showroom. Other major tenants included Chi-Chi's, Kay-Bee Toys, Radio Shack, Payless ShoeSource, and Jo-Ann Fabrics. An exit from Interstate 376 was built specifically to service the mall. Gold Circle became Kmart in 1986, and shortly thereafter, the foundation shifted resulting a crack in the floor that ran the length of the store. 8 inch wide steel plates were used to cover it. Zayre closed in 1989 along with three other stores in the area. David Weis closed in 1990, and its space became Phar-Mor a year later. Also in 1990, the former Zayre became a Kaufmann's clearance center. By 1992, the clearance store was closed, and one- third of its space was converted to CompUSA. The rest later became Syms Corporation. In 1997, Thrift Drug became Eckerd when the latter bought out the chain. In 1999, the arcade and food court were closed, with the latter later converted to a dance studio and a drivers' license office. Syms and Phar-Mor both closed in 2002, and CompUSA moved to Robinson Town Centre. By 2006, the center was largely vacant, with all tenants consolidated to the second floor after the first and third floors were closed to traffic. The mall building also had foundation issues that caused it to shake as the building settled on the fill dirt on which it was built. Some of the vibrations were caused by truck traffic passing by on the nearby Interstate. Kmart announced its closure in late 2012, with its last day of operation January 6, 2013. After this closure, the last remaining tenants were shuttered or relocated within the month, including GNC, a sports apparel store, a nail salon, a martial arts studio, and an optician. The mall began to undergo demolition in August 2016. As of February 2019, The mall has been completely demolished except the Giant Eagle/Former Kmart building. Small hollow chunks of the mall still remain on the back and side of the building.

Lighthouses were built on both rocks; the West Maiden was abandoned in 1903 and the East Maiden was automated in 1977. Establishment of lighthouses After receiving requests from Larne merchants and Admiral Benjamin Hallowell Carew for a lighthouse to be placed on The Maidens, George Halpin, the Ballast Board's Inspector of Works and Inspector of Lighthouses, inspected the rocks in 1819. He recommended the placement of two lighthouses. The plans were approved in 1824 and Halpin designed the lighthouses and supervised their construction. Building was completed and the lights switched on by 5 January 1829. The towers were 800 yards apart: the West Tower, on the northern rock, rose 84 feet above sea level and could be seen 13 miles away; the East Tower, on the southern rock, reached 94 feet and was visible from a distance of 14 miles. The keepers of the lighthouses and their families originally lived on site for the whole year. In one case, this led to romance when, in the 1830s, the Assistant Keeper of one lighthouse fell in love with daughter of the keeper of the other, often visiting her by boat; after the families fell out and her father forbade them to meet, they eloped to Carrickfergus on the mainland. Abandonment of West Tower The inactive West Maidens Lighthouse An extra light, to illuminate the Highland Rocks, was built into a window in the East Tower in 1889. However, the Engineer to the Commissioners of Irish Lights, William Douglass, in December 1898 recommended the establishment of a lightvessel north of the Highland Rocks. It would house a more powerful light and a fog siren, and coupled with increasing the light and addition of a siren to the East Tower would allow the abandonment of the West Tower. This plan, and a further suggestion in 1899, of a light being built on the Highland Rocks came to nothing. However, the light on the East Tower was improved and put into operation on 12 March 1903; the West Tower was abandoned. The solitary working lighthouse was now known as Maidens. The buildings of the old West Tower are still standing; the lighthouse remains intact and the internal stairs and external walkway to the living quarters can still be used. However, the living quarters have decayed into a ruined state. The structures can be seen from the shore. In 1906, the Maiden was combined with the operation of Ferris Point lighthouse, under the supervision of the Ferris Point keeper. New accommodation for four Assistant Keepers was built at Ferris Point; three assistants now worked on the Maidens at any one time, serving 30 days at the lighthouse followed by 10 days with their family at Ferris Point, when he also assisted the Principal Keeper. The Principal Keeper was also responsible for inspecting the Maidens. However, in 1951, the Maidens was separated from Ferris Point, and once more had its own Principal Keeper. Early in the 1970s, the Commissioners of Irish Lights began a modernisation programme, with the intention of automating the Maidens and passing control to Ferris Point. The accommodation at Ferris Point was demolished and additional Keepers were added to improve the ratio of days spent working at the lighthouse. Automation By October 1977, an electric light was added to the lighthouse and by 31 October of that year, the Keepers were withdrawn as the Maidens became an automatic operation and control passed to Ferris Point. Currently, the station is monitored by an Attendant as well as from the headquarters of the Commissioners of Irish Lights at D√∫n Laoghaire. A racon showing Morse code \\"M\\" (--) was added in 1996. The light's nominal range was reduced from 24 to 23 nautical miles in September 2010 and the light characteristic was set at three white flashes every 15 seconds (Fl (3) W 15s). The lighthouse buildings remain in good repair.

Prolonged breeders, the majority of frog species, have breeding seasons at regular intervals where male-male competition occurs with males arriving at the waters edge first in large number and producing a wide range of vocalizations, with variations in depth of calls the speed of callsTungara Frog Study‚Äôs Findings Counter Sexual Selection Theory Published 29 August 2015, by Matt Towns and other complex behaviours to attract mates. The fittest males will have the deepest croaks and the best territories, with females known to make their mate choices at least partly based on the males depth of croaking. This has led to sexual dimorphism, with females being larger than males in 90% of species, males in 10% and males fighting for groups of females. There is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with. Some species store sperm through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.  Selection in salamanders  Smooth newt Italian crested newt Red-backed salamander Important aspects of courtship displays include male alert posture, approach and pursuit, the marking of the substrate trail, and tail undulations. Once a male has the attention of the female, he may release pheromones, which are used for individual recognition, mate recognition, and mate choice decisions, and generally increase female receptivity towards the male's spermatophore and improve his chances of reproductive success with her. In the red-legged salamander (Plethodon shermani), males directly apply pheromones onto the female's nares. In the aquatic smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris), the pheromones are delivered indirectly; the male wafts them towards the female with his tail. In some species, it has been shown that the size a larger, more elaborate male's tail has played a role in the female's decision to mate. In the newt species of the Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), males that possessed large mid-dorsal body crests were more favorable to the females looking to mate. Female choice is the final step in the males attempt to reproduce; if the female does not find the male's traits desirable, reproduction will not be successful. As it is in most species, body size is an important and most common desired trait amongst females. Body size is indicative of fitness and/or genetic quality; and because it is easily observable, it can be an indicator for how a female will pick her mate. A larger body size positively correlates to higher paternity; thus larger males are more successful in siring more offspring than smaller males. Male salamanders also prefer larger females because they produce more ova than smaller females. In sexual coercion, a form of male sexual intimidation which includes forced copulations, repeated mating attempts with the same female, and punishing resisting females. males forcibly mate with females; an example is the red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). It has also been proposed as a third form of sexual selection, along with intersexual selection and intrasexual selection, even though prevailing scientific opinion is that sexual coercion is a manifestation of sexual conflict, stemming out of the natural discord between males and females. In some species of salamanders, females that are territorial and aggressive also intimidate males. Plethodon cinereus females aggressively punish males who are exhibiting social polygyny. Males have been shown to punish females that partake in mating polyandry, forcing them into mating monogamously. Populations of salamanders tend to be heavily male-biased, which results in a higher number of males vying for access to the lesser number of females. Males will use different tactics in an effort to keep other males away from the female of interest and ensure their own paternity and reproductive success, such as sexual defense, which is used to steal other males spermatophore, which may have already deposited into the female, and sexual interference, when a male pushes the female away from another courting male, such as sperm capping, whereby a competing male lays his spermatophore directly on top of those previously deposited by another male. Females also participate in sexual interference: a rival female places herself between the courting male and the female he is courting, and attempts to engage the male in their own courtship dance, a tactic for avoiding sperm competition. The male removes the sperm from a female who had mated with a previous male: many species of salamanders will remove the spermatophore from the previous male and insert his own; thus, ensuring his paternity. Sperm storage is a method by which females can control the sperm that fertilizes their eggs. Female salamanders and newts, most notably Triturus vulgaris, possess sperm-storage glands called spermathecae in the walls of their cloacae. Sperm storage has evolved independently to control reproduction in response to the environment. Females have the ability to store multiple spermatophores until they are needed for fertilization. Sperm storage leads to the post-copulatory sexual selection process of cryptic female choice, which occurs when a female removes the deposited sperm or favors one set of spermatophore over another, during or after copulation. Spermatophores are composed of a cap containing the spermatozoa and a gelatinous support arrangement which fastens the spermatophore to a substrate. Spermatophores are very central to reproductive success; therefore, they are handled carefully. Mating success has a direct correlation to favorable phenotypic traits such as tail loss, adult body size, and age.  Vocal signaling in frogs  Gray tree frog Glass frog Northern cricket frog Boophis madagascariensis The vocalizations that male frogs use to call for females are crucial for reproductive success in frogs. Initially, male frogs will produce advertisement calls, considered a pre-mating isolating mechanism because females use them to isolate conspecific males,Gerhardt, H. & Huber, F. Acoustic Communication in Insects and Anurans: Common Problems and Diverse Solutions. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press.: 2002). as cited in which convey information about species, sexual readiness, and size,Wells, K. & Schwartz, J. The behavioral ecology of anuran communication. Hearing and sound communication in amphibians. 28, 44‚Äì86 (2007). with females moving towards the call they find most attractive. In Hyla versicolor, females favor long calls rather than short callsWells, K. D. & Ryan, M. \\"The energetics of calling in frogs.\\" Anuran communication. 45‚Äì60 (2001). while in Dendropsophus microcephalus they are attracted to short and high rate calling. isolated spring peeper call. If a female shows interest male frogs will switch to courtship calls, some of which are simply an increase in rate, as cited by Wells and Schwartz, which can contain fifty percent more notes than advertisement calls, and can become more complex when a male is at a specific oviposition site. as cited by The glass frog (Hyalinobatrachium fleischmanni) from Panama gives long calls when a female frog is first seen and will switch to multiple staccato chirps once a female indicates interest. as cited by Since anurans are highly sensitive to motion, females use conspicuous movements to communicate interest. A female frog may also send vocal signals of her own to males, motivating copulation and competitive behaviors. Female Iberian midwife toads (Alytes cisternasii) use courtship calls to distinguish themselves from other male competitors. The African common platanna (Xenopus laevis) uses duet calling when males are not visible, allowing females to distinguish territorial males from satellite males. The Emei music frog (Babina daunchina) female calling stimulates male movement towards sound or phonotaxis. sophisticated call of Brazilian Torrent Frog. Calling is an energetically expensive activity, requiring high levels of aerobic respiration. Selection favors the most efficient call production, a good quality call that does not require high levels of energy. allowing a male frog to be able to call continuously for females. Dendropsophus microcephalus, a small tree frog, will produce 100 notes per minute for several hours, requiring up to 25 times more oxygen. Some frogs produce less energetic calls and remain in chorus for longer periods of time with the ability to remain active longer being better for mating success than a higher energy vocal display. The morphological and biochemical processes of call production are influenced by sexual selection. as cited by Male frogs have developed vocal sacs that enable louder calls, with the larger tympanum increasing the radiation of the vocal signal. as cited by Males also have larger trunk muscles with highly aerobic muscle fibers, many mitochondria, and fat storage. The sensory exploitation hypothesis states that females have natural preexisting preferences for sexual signals that have been favored by sexual selection, with males producing calls that are known to be favorable for females. A recent study of advertisement calls from 72 species of anurans has indicated that most call features in males show phylogenetic correlation, indicating that species-specific evolution of calls might be constrained by a lack of genetic variation or because female preferences for call features have diverged to only a limited extent. Male anurans will often alter the rate of calling in order to intimidate other males though females tend to favor advertisement and courtship calls over aggressive ones, indicating that aggressive vocalizations are a form of male- male competition. as cited by Advertisement and aggressive calls are usually similar in frequency but produced at different rates. Geocrinia victoriana, an eastern Australian smooth frog, has a long aggressive note to ward off competitors and shorter notes to attract females. In Northern cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) male aggressive calls serve a dual purpose of attracting females and intimidating other male callers. The Madagascar bright eyed frog (Boophis madagascariensis) is able to produce 28 different types of aggressive calls by modifying pulse rate and notes. as cited by Males can intercept vocal signals that were not meant for them in a tactic known as eavesdropping. The Hyla versicolor male increases calling rate and duration once a female is in vicinity. Eavesdroppers will intercept these increased signals and begin to call for the female in a more aggressive manner, which generally leads to escalated conflicts. Eavesdropping also allows male frogs to assess the body size of their competitors. The frequency of vocal signals is dependent on the mass of the laryngeal apparatus, and a large one will produce lower frequency calls, positively correlated to overall body size. Male frogs will use eavesdropping to decide whether or not to initiate aggressive conflicts. Male anurans are more likely to attack a frog with higher frequency calls. It can also inform frogs when the competition has become too intense, where it can reduce or stop calling altogether and move to a different location outside of the chorus. In order to save energy they attempt to call females where there is less competition and a better chance to court a female. Once a satellite male hears a change in vocalizations of other males he will begin courtship calling in an attempt to steal a female, with some males now invests more energy into a competitive courtship call which may sway the female's interest. Satellite males may contribute 20% of sexual reproduction in a populations. as cited by  Polygynandry in frogs  Allobates femoralis Bibron's toadlet Anuran mating systems are promiscuous: females and males breed with multiple mates and females exhibit sequential polyandry when one female is fertilized by more than one male at different times. Anurans are external fertilizers so there is no sperm competition. Polyandry has benefits for females such as fertility insurance, paternal care insurance and dispersal of mortality risk. Female anurans have a high risk of mating with sperm depleted males due to frequent mating and tend to select the same few males displaying fitness qualities. The requirement for successful copulation is that the male and female gametes have to be released at the same time and at the right orientation. as cited by In anurans, 70% of polyandrous species exhibit paternal care. In Allobates femoralis the female's offspring survival depends on the male's carrying abilities, as they are responsible for carrying tadpoles from terrestrial to aquatic sites. If a female only mates with one male and he is a poor parent, she may lose all of her offspring. Females reduce the risk of losing all of their offspring because it is likely that some of the males they mated with make good parents. Sequential polyandry will allow females to have a multiple clutches in different nest sites, reducing the risk of abiotic factors, such as temperature, or biotic factors like predators affecting development of the offspring. as cited by Some male behaviors that may have led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing that insurance against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry. Dimorphism and morphology Small male and large female Fleay's barred frog (Mixophyes fleayi) in amplexus Male tusked frog Sexual dimorphism is seen as size difference between sexes in salamanders and in 90% of anuran species. Larger females is a result of selection for fecundity, including egg size or clutch size as they can store more energy and produce more offspring.Andersson, M. Sexual Selection. Princeton University Press (1994) as cited by Females are never more than twice the size of males. Size is important in male-male competition, with larger males having an advantage, due to the \\"male combat hypothesis\\" which suggests that male combative behavior is positively related to male body size. Males in the tusked frog (Adelotus brevis) and the fanged frog (Limnonectes kuhlii) use fangs and tusks as weapons to defend their calling sites. Larger body size and larger weaponry leads to higher reproductive rates. as cited by However, data suggest that this male mechanism only operates in superfamily Dentrobatoidea, possibly due to alternative mating techniques that reduce selection pressure on body size. Large African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus adspersus) males defend territories while small intimidated males move away and become satellite males. These smaller males use eavesdropping techniques and mate with females who are in range of their satellite location.  Sexual role reversal in Dendrobates auratus  Poison dart frog Dendrobates auratus Initial observation of mating in the green poison-dart frog Dendrobates auratus shows convincing evidence of sex- role reversal. Small female clutch size, female-female competition, and large parental care investment by males are characteristic of sexual role reversal. as cited by To test whether this sexual role reversal was true, two hypotheses were tested; the sexual role reversal hypothesis and the parental quality hypothesis. For the sexual role reversal hypothesis to be true, females would compete for as many males as possible, and this was not supported because male-male competition for mates was as common as female-female competition. In sexual role reversal males usually become more selective; however, in Dendrobates auratus females were more selective when choosing males, supporting the parental quality hypothesis, which predicted that females would compete for the parental care of particular males. Females were defensive of their mating partners and used courtship techniques to prevent males from mating with other females and destroyed rivals' eggs. These observations support the parental quality hypothesis. Summers weakens the sexual role reversal hypothesis and strengthens the case parental quality selection.

About the reach capacities of electric automobiles, Woods explained: Electric automobile, 1900Woods, 1900, p. 20Electric automobile, 1900Woods, 1900, p. 156 :Manufacturers of electric automobiles are often asked the question: \\"Will not a battery sometime be made to run a vehicle one hundred or more miles on one charge?\\" While this may be possible, the writer hardly thinks it will ever be probable, and his experience with the public is that it is wholly unnecessary, speaking generally and from a practical point of view. Improvements now being made in batteries, in the attempt to make them stand more rapid charges and discharges are much more important than one which will give them a larger mile-age capacity...Woods, 1900, p. 13 About speeding with electric automobile, Woods further explained: :Manufacturers of automobiles in the United States are confining themselves, without exception almost, to a maximum speed within the limits cited, and as very few accidents have occurred in the use of electric automobiles from fast driving, it is safe to say that when city councils do take up the question, all of these things will be considered, and a reasonably fast speed allowed automobile users. Surely twelve to sixteen miles an hour is fast enough when we consider that in city work it is practically double the speed and one-half the time made by the horse. On the first introduction of motor vehicles, a great deal of stress was laid on speed, articles appearing in many papers advocating extremely high speeds, and in some of the tests and races given in this country, nearly fifty per cent of the value of an automobile as a prize v/inner was placed in its speed. The absurdity of this, however, is already proven. Almost any speed desired can be obtained from an electric automobile. It is simply a question of power application and gearing, and those who wish to ride at breakneck speed should only be allowed to do so in places provided for the use of high-speed and racing machines, as roadways or racing tracks set aside for their exclusive use, which will no doubt in time come in the same way that they have been provided for horses.Woods, 1900, p. 47-8 The book further focussed on the elementary conditions of the electric automobile, its construction and rules concerning care and skillful operation. Woods stipulated that \\"the automobile is not a single item produced like the bicycle and sewing-machine,\\" but comes with \\"a wide range of application in its utility and design,... a wide range of prices in its cost of production and marketing,... [and] a multitude of different elements to cater to by the various demands for its usage.\\"Woods, 1900, p. 40  Organizing a factory: an analysis of the elements in factory organization  In 1905 Woods published his first book on management and organization, entitled \\"Organizing a factory: an analysis of the elements in factory organization,\\" which second edition was published in 1907. In this work Woods aimed to present an analysis of the elements in factory organization, the fundamental principles of factory management, and the methods to be used in every department of factory operation. In the Preface (1905) he further explained: :American business men hold that the only way to learn to do things is to do them. This opinion has had much truth and fact to justify it, but it has been undergoing a marked transformation in the past decade. For men are coming to realize that, although no one can learn to do a thing by merely being told how it is done, such precious knowledge greatly facilitates his learning how to do it when once he gets into practical work. It affords him a strong foundation, barren and useless in itself, but a firm basis upon which to build the structure of business experience.Woods (1905, p. 3) Woods visualized the fundamental principles of factory management in a series of four diagrams, showing organization elements (I); authorities (II); segregation of authority (III); and expenditure divisions of a factory (IV). This visualisation is an early example of resp. a flow diagram; a business process modeling or even a business reference model; an organization chart; and a visualization of management accounting: About the segregation of an industrial body into authorities and departments Woods further explains: :Figure III shows the segregation of an industrial body into authorities and departments. This chart shows the absolute division between the commercial and manufacturing ends of the business emphasized in the accompanying discussion and the authority lines connect the various departments in these two divisions with the governing authorities. In each case the number and formal name of each department is in the apex of its triangle, the various detailed duties that come under it are grouped beyond; the productive departments in the manufacturing section are left empty, because their work will vary with the kind of factory under consideration‚Äîeach factory carries the same non- productive departments.Woods (1905, p. 20) The third picture was five years later republished in Parsons' Business Administration (1909). He commented, that the diagram \\"represents in detail the various branches of a large manufacturing concern. First the origin, elective power and executive heads of the company; then the producing, accounting and sales departments... with all their miscellaneous duties.\\"Carl Copeland Parsons. Business Administration, (1909), p. 27.

The school is operated by Academica, an education management organization, on behalf of Somerset Academy Inc., a charter management organization. Overview The school was established in September, 1997. This makes it one of the oldest Somerset schools established in South Florida. The school offers a variety of honors courses. Each honors class awards five points for an A, four points for a B, three points for a C, one point for a D, or zero points for an F to the student's weighted GPA per quarter. Students can opt to take honors courses for their core classes (English, math, science, and social studies), which typically include biology, chemistry, algebra, geometry, geography, and history courses. Also, many higher-leveled elective courses give students the opportunity to earn honors credit. There are also advanced placement courses that students can take. These courses can take the place of core subjects and/or electives. The advanced placement courses also require the students to take a test created by College Board close to the end of the school year. The test grades the student based on a five-point system with three being the least that the student must have in order to pass the test and obtain the college credits for the course he/she has taken. The sports offered at the school include baseball, soccer, tennis and wrestling (Boys and Girls). The school also has a club that sponsors a Pembroke Pines all-male rugby team that is not affiliated with the sports program at Somerset. The school has a TV production course, which the course requires students to run a newscast/video production show on YouTube. It is called the Panther Report, and the class uploads a new video every Friday.

After the eggs hatch, the young stay in the maternal tube for a little time to finish developing before swimming off. A young Floscularia ringens has a cone-shaped body, short foot, little corona, and mastax with trophi, but it still seems to not be able to eat. In less than one day, the young Floscularia ringens makes a lasting connection to a substrate. Its corona now has four lobes, and the foot lengthens. After the corona develops the Floscularia ringens starts to eat through making currents, and it also begins to create its tube. Moment of fame A close-up image of Floscularia ringens came first place in the 2011 Olympus BioScapes Digital Imaging Competition that presents movies and photographs of life science images.\\"Tiny critter becomes a big wheel\\" The photograph depicts Floscularia ringens' feeding method, showing its quickly moving cilia which pulls in water consisting food.

Probably from Hellenized Alexandria, Egypt, c. 250‚Äì300. Diameter 4.2 cm (1 5/8 inches)Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B. Rather roughly trimmed Christian piece with Jonah and the Whale, 10.5 cm across, 4th century Gold sandwich glass was also used for the gold tesserae used in Late Antique, Byzantine and medieval mosaics, as here in Hagia Sophia Gold glass or gold sandwich glass is a luxury form of glass where a decorative design in gold leaf is fused between two layers of glass. First found in Hellenistic Greece, it is especially characteristic of the Roman glass of the Late Empire in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often cut out of the piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the catacombs of Rome as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried. About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered.Grig, 204-5; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also); 8‚Äì9 Corning video Complete vessels are far rarer. Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional Greco-Roman religion and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. Others show portraits of their owners, and the finest are \\"among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity\\".Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, \\"The Catacombs\\" at illustration 7.7 From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in mosaics. Various different techniques may sometimes also be described as \\"gold glass\\". Zwischengoldglas is very similar but the two layers of glass are cemented, not fused. It mostly comes from Germany and Bohemia from the 18th and 19th centuries. Verre √©glomis√© properly covers a single layer of glass which is gilded (or coated with other types of metal leaf) on the back, as used in 19th century shop signs and the like. One process was revived by Jean-Baptise Glomy (1711‚Äì1786), hence the name. Both of these processes were also used in ancient times, and the German and French languages often use their native terms for what is called \\"gold glass\\" in English. Gold ruby glass or \\"cranberry glass\\" is actually red, coloured by the addition of gold oxide.See the Corning Museum \\"Glass glossary\\" entries for all these terms Gold-band glass is another ancient technique covered below. Technique The manufacturing process for gold glass was difficult and required great skill. For a Late Roman glass, first a small round flat disc, typically about three to five inches across, was cut away from a blown sphere with a flattened bottom, either made of coloured or plain glass. A piece of gold leaf was then glued to this with gum arabic. The design was created by scraping away gold leaf. The main vessel, a cup or bowl, was formed by blowing and cutting, with a flat bottom the same size as the first disc. This was then heated again and carefully lowered onto the disc with the design, superimposing the flat bottom with the disc with the design so that they fused together. The complete vessel was then heated a final time to complete the fusing. Different accounts of different periods vary somewhat as to the precise sequence of stages and other details, but the process is essentially the same.Corning video; see also the Corning Museum \\"Glass glossary\\", which appears to somewhat contradict the video. The larger Hellenistic glass bowls are thought to have been formed using moulding rather than blown, as the whole bowl is doubled and the inner and outer vessels must fit together exactly.Williams, 190 Some of the finer later medallions seem to have been made as such from the start, and some contain pigments other than the gold.Example from the Corning Museum of Glass showing both features; also Gennadios and the Brescia portrait These smoother- edged medallions exploited the medium of glass as a matrix for portrait miniatures, and it has proved to be a very effective one, outlasting all alternatives except for precious metal and engraved gems. They were probably initially made to be hung for display, or set in jewellery in smaller examples like that of Gennadios, but were also used for funerary purposes, and often use a base of blue glass. They are a few Roman examples of vessels from Cologne of a different style where several of what have been called \\"sidewall blobs\\", small gold glass medallions about 2‚Äì3 cm across, with images, are fused into the walls of a vessel.Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3‚Äì4 and note, now British Museum; Vickers, 612‚Äì613 has the best photos of \\"blobs\\" Roman bowl with gold band glass Apart from roundels with figurative images the fused sandwich technique was used to create the tesserae for gold in mosaics, and for beads and the like. Gold glass tesserae, at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. Tesserae were made in blocks or \\"cakes\\" and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large in the case of gold backgrounds. Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or yellow ochre backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect. Most colours of tesserae seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones. In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of Kiev seems to have used gold tesserae made in Constantinople.Cormack, 388‚Äì391; Grove, 124 Roman gold glass beads were made by using an inner tube or rod to which the gold leaf was stuck. A larger tube was slid over that and the beads crimped off. Easily transported and very attractive, Roman gold glass beads have been found as far outside the Empire as the Wari-Bateshwar ruins in Bangladesh, and sites in China, Korea, Thailand and Malaysia.Francis, 91‚Äì93 Gold-band glass is a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, sandwiched between colourless glass, are used as part of the marbling effect in onyx glass. It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.Trentinella, Rosemarie. \\"Roman Gold-Band Glass\\", Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2003 Grave-markers Dougga banquet scene, 3rd century (see text) The most common form of vessel in late Roman examples was a bowl or drinking cup, which are thought to have been originally family gifts for weddings, anniversaries, New Year, the various religious festivals and the like, in some cases perhaps presented at birth or Christian baptism.Beckwith, 25; Weitzmann no. 396; Rudgers, 85 None of the type of gold glass vessels cut down as grave-markers has survived complete, though about 500 of the cut-off bottoms are known,Grig, 204; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also), 8‚Äì9 but since so many have inscriptions encouraging the owner to drink, they are usually referred to as \\"cups\\" or \\"glasses\\". However Roman drinking cups and glasses were often very wide and shallow, though tall straight-sided or slightly flared shapes like modern tumblers are also found. A mosaic in the North African ruins of Dougga shows two hefty slaves pouring wine from amphorae into two shallow bowls held by slaves waiting on the banquet. The two amphorae are inscribed with \\"Œ†ŒôŒï\\" and \\"Œ£ŒóœπŒóœπ\\" the Greek originals of the toasting formulae \\"pie zeses\\" (\\"Drink, may you live\\", discussed below) so common on Roman glasses, and it has been suggested that the mosaic shows the shape a complete cup would have had.by Smith, see Lutraan, 75 and note 197 4th century married couple, inscribed \\"PIE ZESES\\" (\\"Drink, may you live\\") 3rd-century quality portrait of a couple At what was probably a much later date, perhaps after decades of use, on the death of the owner the main vessel of undecorated glass was cut away and trimmed to leave only the gold glass roundel, which was then used in the catacombs as a grave marker. Presumably in many cases the cup had already broken in the normal course of use, and the thick bottom with the decoration had been preserved for later use in this way. Bodies were buried in the catacombs in small recesses called loculi, stacked one above another mostly along narrow corridors hollowed out from the soft rock, and no doubt some form of marker was necessary for visitors to locate the right spot. They may also have functioned as a seal on the grave, as they were pressed into the mortar or stucco forming the final surface of the wall of the loculus; other classes of small decorative objects were also used in the same way. They may also have been regarded as capable of warding off evil spirits, especially in the later part of the period, when portraits of saints become most common.Rutgers, 84‚Äì85; Grig, 204‚Äì209, and throughout; Beckwith, 25; Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, \\"The Catacombs\\" at illustration 7.6; Lutraan, 4‚Äì5 The very untidy trimming of many examples may be explained by this; an example in the Metropolitan Museum of Art is still attached to a chunk of mortar round much of its edge, showing that the mortar overlapped the edge of the glass. Rough edges would mostly have been hidden by the mortar and also provided a firmer key for the mortar to hold the glass in place (as it happens the edges of the New York piece are unusually neatly trimmed).Bowl Base with Christ Giving Martyrs‚Äô Crowns to Saints Peter and Paul, MMA online, accn. 11.91.4; see also Lutraan, 5 and note 7 Many pieces of gold glass had portraits of private individuals, mostly married couples, who may have included the deceased, while others had portraits of religious figures such as saints, or religious symbols. This custom was followed by Christian, Jewish (13 identifiably Jewish examples are known) and pagan Romans. The different sets of imagery, apart from the increased number of private portraits, are typical of the paintings also found in the catacombs and other Early Christian art and its Jewish equivalent from the period.Beckwith, 25‚Äì26; For Jewish material, Rudgers, 81‚Äì85 (13 examples on 81); Weitzmann p. 371 and numbers 347 ff.; Lutraan, 12 and throughout As Christian art developed in the late 4th and 5th centuries, its changes are reflected in the subjects and their treatment in gold glass, before the catacombs ceased to be used and the supply of examples ends.Weitzmann nos. 503, 507‚Äì8, 510 are late examples Hellenistic period The technique was used in Hellenistic times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry.Gold-glass skyphos (drinking cup) fragment, Metropolitan Museum of Art (23.160.76) The British Museum has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3 cm wide and 11.4 cm high, one of two from a tomb in Canosa in Apulia dating to around 270‚Äì160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with lotus and acanthus motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures. There are a handful of other near complete examples, and rather more fragments. These pieces are usually assigned to Alexandria in Egypt, which is often seen as the originating centre for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century satirist Martial and other sources; one seems to show a Nilotic landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere. However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on Rhodes.Rotroff, 333 A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer Athenaeus) mentions two vessels that are diachysa (\\"with gold in it\\") and very likely made by this technique.\\"Sandwich gold-glass bowl\\", British Museum online highlights; Williams, 190. Though textually very similar, these differ over the dating, with the book (2009) saying 210‚Äì160 BC and the website (in May 2013) 270‚Äì200 BC. Further photos here Roman period Detail of a gold glass medallion with a portrait of a family, from Alexandria (Roman Egypt), 3rd‚Äì4th century (Brescia, Museo di Santa Giulia) Gold glass mosaic tesserae begin to be used in domestic mosaics in the 1st century AD, with Rome apparently the first location. They continued to be used throughout the ancient and medieval periods into the modern day. By around 400 gold began to be used as the background colour for Christian religious mosaics, as it was throughout the Byzantine period.Conventi, 1‚Äì3; specifically, \\"the earliest known use of gold tesserae was in 55 AD, in the Gardens of Lucullus by the Spanish Steps in Rome The decorated late Roman pieces are usually assumed to have been made in and around Rome, especially in the case of portraits of residents there, but also in the Rhineland around Cologne and Augusta Treverorum, modern Trier, which was a centre for other luxury glass products like cage cups. Alexandria is still thought to have been a major centre, and from linguistic analysis of the inscriptions it has been suggested that the technique, and perhaps the actual artists and craftsmen, reached Rome and Germany from there. Yet it may just be a coincidence of survival that the other large body of \\"middle-class\\" portraiture from the period is the Fayum mummy portraits from Egypt.Beckwith, 25; Hennig, 215 Apart from the Rhineland finds discussed below, small numbers of cut-off vessel bases have been found in northern Italy and modern Hungary and Croatia.Lutraan, 5 The Gennadios medallion in New York, illustrated above, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local dialect features. He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios, Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image. One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an Early Medieval crux gemmata in Brescia, in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and Gothic queen Galla Placida (died 450) and her children;Boardman, 338‚Äì340; Beckwith, 25 in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of Isis.Vickers, 611 The portrait in the Brescia medallion also shares clear stylistic features with the Fayum mummy portraits of Roman Egypt, in addition to a Greek inscription in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt.For a description of scholarly research on the Brescia Medallion, see Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). \\"A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).\\" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council), p. 7. Accessed 2 October 2016.). \\"Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‚ÄòFonds de coupes‚Äô in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq‚Äôs comprehensive Dictionnaire d‚Äôarch√©ologie chr√©tienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel‚Äôs catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de M√©ly challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de M√©ly‚Äôs hypothesis was supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion‚Äôs authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci‚Äôs dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum‚Äôs assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De M√©ly noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.\\" \\"Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de M√©ly himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue- backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‚Äòbrushed technique‚Äô to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter‚Äôs precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.\\" This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.Grig, 207 Yet J√°s Elsner (2007) contends that the Brescia medallion, likely depicting a family from Alexandria since the inscription is in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek, has a range of possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century Christian cross.J√°s Elsner (2007). \\"The Changing Nature of Roman Art and the Art Historical Problem of Style,\\" in Eva R. Hoffman (ed), Late Antique and Medieval Art of the Medieval World, 11‚Äì18. Oxford, Malden & Carlton: Blackwell Publishing. , p. 17, Figure 1.3 on p. 18. It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using lenses.Sines and Sakellarakis, 194‚Äì195 Where the refined \\"Alexandrian\\" medallions, wherever they were actually produced, mostly have a simple thin gold line framing the subject, the Roman examples have a variety of heavier frames, often using two round borders, the style of which forms part of efforts to group them by workshop.Rutgers, 83 The level of portraiture is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.Grig, 207; Lutraan, 29‚Äì45 goes into considerable detail Two Christian saints, 4th century An \\"Alexander plate with hunting scene\\" in the Cleveland Museum of Art is, if genuine,Presumably the piece described by Vickers (p. 610) as \\"widely suspected to be a modern forgery\\" a very rare example of a complete vessel decorated with gold glass, and comes from the upper elite of Roman society. It is a shallow bowl or plate 25.7 cm (10 1/8 inches) in diameter and 4.5 cm (1 3/4 inches) high. The decorated flat roundel in the centre takes about two thirds of the whole diameter. It shows a mounted huntsman with a spear pursuing two elk, while beneath his horse a huntsman on foot with a hound on a leash confronts a wild boar. The Latin inscription \\"\\" means \\"Alexander fortunate man, drink, may you live, together with yours\\". The identity of \\"Alexander\\" has been the subject of discussion, but he is on the whole though to be an unknown aristocrat rather than Alexander the Great or the Emperor Alexander Severus (reigned 232‚Äì235). The dish is perhaps slightly later than his reign and at least during his reign he could never be addressed as merely a \\"man\\".Weitzmann, no. 79, entry by R.B., which translates the inscription \\"Alexander, fortunate man, may you live [long] with your family and friends in affection\\" ‚Äì a more literal version is given here; Cleveland Museum of Art, online collection image. The object was not on display in May 2013. It was intact in about 1900 but broken in 1968, then repaired. The image from Cleveland show large areas of the undecorated glass missing, that are present in Weitzmann's black-and-white photo. The Greek drinking toast ZHCAIC given in Latin letters as ZESES, meaning \\"live!\\" or \\"may you live\\", is a very common part of inscriptions on gold glass,Weitzmann nos. 388, and 347‚Äì348 etc; Lutraan, 53 and sometimes the only inscription.Bowl Base with Miracle Scenes, Metropolitan Museum of Art (16.174.2) It is more common than the Latin equivalent VIVAS, probably because it was considered more refined, somewhat like the modern \\"bon app√©tit\\" used in English. Two glasses including images of Jesus \\"misspell\\" \\"ZESES\\" as \\"ZESUS\\", managing to achieve wordplay between a drinking toast and the name of the Christian saviour.Lutraan, 55‚Äì56 Gladiator in gold glass Such secular \\"blessings\\" are typical, and on roundels made from cups they often urge the owner to drink, even when the iconography is religious. One Jewish example has the usual array of symbols and the inscription \\"Drink, [so] you may live, Elares\\". The Wedding at Cana is a popular Christian subject, with one example inscribed \\"Worthy of your friends, may you live in the peace of God, drink\\".Weitzmann nos. 347 and 396 respectively Another popular phrase is DIGNITAS AMICORUM or \\"[you are] the honour of your friends\\".Lutraan, 57‚Äì58 The majority of inscriptions are made up of either names or such conventional expressions, or the two combined. An example inscribed \\"DIGNITAS AMICORVM PIE ZESES VIVAS\\" typifies the tendency to pile together the common phrases.Lutraan, 60‚Äì61 The convivial dedications found on so many examples are paralleled by several of the far more luxurious cage cups or diatreta. One round bottom from a larger bowl found in the catacombs is 10.8 cm across, and now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. It has five abbreviated scenes from the Old and New Testaments surrounding a married couple in a roundel, with the feet of the outer figures to the centre.Newby, 24‚Äì25 (with photo); Vickers, 610‚Äì611 A large and complex bowl from Cologne was decorated all over with Christian scenes and Imperial portraits, but presumably because of its size (height 8.6, diameter 11.4 cm) no second layer of glass was fused on, so the gold has now all been lost, though the shapes of the design can be seen. The portraits of the sons of Constantine I allow an unusually precise probable dating to 326, his vicennalia, or the 25th anniversary of his reign.Weitzmann nos. 377. Made, found and still in Cologne, now R√∂misch-Germanisches Museum Another complete piece is a paten from the Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne, founded in the 4th century. This is decorated with roundels containing Old Testament scenes and floral motifs. According to the Liber Pontificalis, Pope Zephyrinus, in office from 199‚Äì217, had approved the use of glass patens, and ones in other glass techniques survive.Milburn, 270 A variant technique is only known from vessels from Cologne with what have been called \\"sidewall blobs\\", where small gold glass medallions with images are fused into the walls of a vessel; one of the few examples was found in the cemetery of St Severin.Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3‚Äì4 and note, now British Museum Iconography of the vessel bottoms Saint Peter, Virgin Mary in orant pose, Saint Paul, 4th century Almost all the Roman vessel bottoms have imagery of some sort, and around 240 have legible inscriptions as well. Of these, about half of the total number of gold glasses known,As catalogued by Lutraan; most of this section uses her for quantitative statements portraits are most common, but there are small narrative scenes, mainly Christian but a few pagan. Portraits of Christian sacred figures are on about half the full corpus.Grig, 215 There are a small number of depictions of sports, animals, wreaths and the like, and a single example with a central image of a plant. No Imperial portraits are recorded, nor military scenes; unlike so much Roman public art the glasses concentrate on the private interests of individuals. Apart from a single near-naked Venus and some figures of erotes,Lutraan, 25‚Äì26 sexual themes are another notable absence compared to much Roman art. Most glasses feature a single image occupying most of the round space within the border, but some have a number of small scenes, usually arranged in small circular frames around a central image. Most portraits are between bust and half-length.Lutraan, Chapter 2; Milburn, 270‚Äì272 The small number of glasses with Jewish iconography are covered separately below. Either portraits or inscriptions naming private individuals are very common, though other examples have no personalizing aspect and were perhaps just bought from a dealer's stock.Lutraan, 29‚Äì31 Portraits of married couples are at first most the common, but saints were more numerous towards the end of the period; the two are also often combined.Grig, reported by Lutraan, 11, 14, 17 It is not always possible to distinguish the two confidently, despite tituli inscriptions and a convention of using contemporary dress for owners and a conventional out of date costume for sacred figures, even recent male ones such as Pope Damasus I (r. 366‚Äì384). Damasus, exceptionally for a contemporary cleric, appears on at least four glasses, or at least it is thought he is who \\"DAMAS\\" refers to.\\"DAMAS\\" on 4 glasses per Grig, 5 per Lutraan; Grig, 208‚Äì215 and ff.; Lutraan, 31‚Äì32 and pages following, page 39 on female sacred figures who dress in more contemporary styles. Saints Peter and Paul together are very common, usually facing each other in profile, but sometimes with other figures. Both were martyred in Rome, and especially popular there;Lutraan, 40‚Äì42; Milburn, 270‚Äì272; Grig, 216‚Äì217 other local martyrs such as Agnes are depicted several times,Lutraan, 44‚Äì45, Grig, 220‚Äì221 and according to Lucy Grig \\"the Roman-ness of the saints portrayed on the Roman glasses is striking\\", and five popes from the 3rd and 4th centuries are probably depicted.Grig, 215‚Äì216, 215 quoted, 219‚Äì220 on popes Christ is shown in a number of examples, usually as clean- shaven and youthful, as well as figures such as the Good Shepherd which may symbolize him, or in some cases Orpheus or general bucolic imagery. A small Christ may stand between the heads of a married couple, blessing them.Lutraan, 42‚Äì44 Orants perhaps representing the soul of an owner when not identified as a saint, and as in the catacombs always shown as female, appear a number of times, and female saints and the Virgin are always shown in the orant pose.Lutraan, 44‚Äì45; Grig, 220‚Äì221 Christian Raising of Lazarus, 4th century Narrative scenes from the Old Testament are more common than miracles of Christ, as in the catacomb paintings, and the same \\"abbreviated representations\\" of scenes of deliverance feature: the story of Jonah, Daniel in the lions' den, the three youths in the Fiery Furnace.Lutraan, 21‚Äì23 The most common scenes in later Christian art, centred around the liturgical calendar, are very rare. There are really only two non-Christian narrative scenes: one labour of Hercules (two more are shown in \\"sidewall blobs\\"), and one of Achilles, but a number of \\"portrait\\" figures, as with Christian sacred figures often combined with owners.Lutraan, 20‚Äì21 There are a small number of \\"agonistic\\" or sporting scenes, with wrestlers, boxers, one gladiator, and several racing chariot teams. Several of these, like others seeming to represent victory in a musical or dramatic context, feature palms and crowns and may well have been presented to celebrate victory in these fields in some amateur or professional setting, like the Alexandrian Gennadios portrait. Two identical glasses featuring two boxers with a trainer, all named, suggest that the glasses may sometimes have been ordered in sets; one may speculate that this may have been common.Lutraan, 24‚Äì25 Single examples show Athena presiding over shipbuilders, a pair of personifications of Rome and Constantinople, and female figures representing the monetae or mints, which are often shown on coins. A number have animals that may carry symbolic meaning, or objects such as scrolls or wreaths.Lutraan, 26‚Äì28 The short inscriptions tend to be similar regardless of the content of the image, with names and the \\"convivial formulae\\" described above together or separately predominating. A religious implication (as may be intended in vivas or zeses for example) is relatively rarely explicitly stated.Lutraan's chapter 3 analyses these, and chapter 4 discusses relations between the images and their accompanying inscriptions. The names are in the single cognomen form which is hard to relate to such records as survive,Lutraan, 62 but three glasses can possibly be related to known individuals who were potential owners, and one to a family (that of the poet Ausonius).Lutraan, 67‚Äì69 These persons are rather grand, and one might think belonged to the classes buried in sarcophagi rather than loculi; the glasses perhaps belonged to \\"amici\\", clients or dependents, or had passed as gifts or legacies by the subjects.Grig, 211‚Äì212 One glass in the British Museum is unusual in a number of respects: between a named couple is a smaller figure of Hercules, and the inscription: \\"ORFITVS ET CONSTANTIA IN NOMINE HERCVLlS ACERENTINO FELICES BIBATIS\\" or \\"Orfitus and Constantia, may you live/drink in happiness in the name of Hercules of Acerentia\\". This may well represent Memmius Vitruvius Orfitus, prefect of Rome, and his wife. Acerentia in southern Italy had a local cult of Hercules.\\"Gold-glass medallion showing Herakles\\"; Lutraan, 67‚Äì70 For some historians Orfitus was \\"notorious as the propaganda mastermind of the 'pagan revival'\\" of his day.Grig, 208 Jewish glasses Probably 4th century, open Torah ark, Lions of Judah, peacocks and ritual objects Jewish ritual objects, Rome, 2nd century AD Only 13 of the more than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to represent \\"the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity\\".Rutgers, 81. What Rudgers' figure includes is not absolutely clear (for example glasses with non-Jewish imagery found in Jewish catacombs). They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact find spot and context of the great majority is unrecorded. Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography,Rutgers, 82; Grig, 228 and show that \\"some Jews felt no qualm in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs\\".Rutgers, 85; Elsner's article casts doubt on the whole notion of separate arts for Jews and Christians in the period Identifiably Jewish roundels do not feature portraits but with one exception have a fairly standard array of religious symbols. The most common arrangement is on two levels, with two Lions of Judah flanking a Torah ark above, and below two menarot, a shofar (rams horn), etrog, lulav and perhaps others of the four Species, scrolls and vases. Not all the tiny symbols can be confidently identified.Weitzmann nos. 347‚Äì348; Rutgers, 82. One finely painted example in the Israel Museum mentioned by Rutgers, 83 and with an image at the external link at the end of the article has two birds flanking the Torah ark and the lions with a single Menorah below. Alternatively, the objects are all in the top tier, above a banqueting scene.Bowl Fragments with Menorah, Shofar, and Torah Ark, Metropolitan Museum of Art (18.145.1a, b), also in Weitzmann as no. 348; for another variant on this theme in the Vatican, see Elsner, 115‚Äì116 The single exception to such compositions has what is thought to be a representation of the Temple of Jerusalem, perhaps representing the feat of Purim.Rutgers, 82‚Äì83 Most scholars are confident that Jewish customers used the same workshops as those of the other religions, who presumably kept patterns for designs for all religions, or were provided with sketches. Some of the attempts to group glasses by workshop attribute Jewish glasses and those of other religions to the same workshop. Apart from the use of symbols rather than human figures, the Jewish glasses seem to have been used in very much the same way as those from other religious groups, which is also characteristic of other classes of Jewish artefacts from Rome at this time, where the Jewish community adopted many aspects of the general Roman way of life. Of the 13 known, five have inscriptions including the phrase \\"pie zeses\\" (see above) and two \\"anima dulcis\\" (literally \\"sweet soul\\", equating to \\"sweetheart\\"), both very common phrases in Christian and pagan inscriptions. The rarer phrase \\"vivas cum ...\\" (\\"live with ...\\") is also found on Jewish and non-Jewish glasses. They would seem to have been given as gifts on the same sort of occasions, and there is evidence that Roman Jews shared the general Roman custom of New Year present-giving.Rutgers, 83‚Äì85, and more generally for shared artistic and cultural practices: 81, 85, 88 and throughout; Grig, 205 and note; Elsner, throughout Later uses and collections 4th-century portrait, now in Bologna The technique continued to be used for mosaic tesserae, and at times for pieces that remained relatively large, for example in a small tile in New York with a pattern forming a cross, perhaps from a Syrian church of the 9th to 12th centuries.Metropolitan Museum of Art (46.174) A small group of Islamic vessels are decorated with mostly simplified vegetal motifs and probably date to the 10th century from Syria; the most complete ones are decorated over a large curved area and must have been made by using a \\"double vessel\\" method. In both respects these are closer to the Hellenistic vessels than most Roman ones.Wenzel, summary on p. 45 From at least the 17th century the Roman glasses attracted antiquarian interest and they began to be removed from the catacombs, in a largely disorganized and unrecorded fashion; now only a \\"handful\\" remain in their original position in the catacomb walls.Lutraan, 4 The first significant publication on them was by Filippo Buonarroti in 1716, Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma (\\"Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome\\"), in which he made the extraordinary, almost proto- Romantic assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for primitive art.Rudoes, 307 and note; James Hall, \\"Michelangelo and the Etruscans\\", New York Review of Books 53.17 ¬∑ 2 November 2006 After other studies, the Italian Jesuit Raffaele Garrucci published the first illustrated survey in 1858, with an expanded second edition in 1864.Rudoes, 307 In the 19th century a number of imitations, copies and downright forgeries of Roman pieces were made, mostly in Murano off Venice, by firms such as Salviati.Rudoes, throughout; for example, no. 1043 in the catalogue of Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass: volume three, Part 2, ed. David B. Whitehouse, 2004, Hudson Hills, , 9780872901551, google books; Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection The first major public exhibition of these seems to have been at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, by Italian firms.Rudoes, 305 A number of museums around the world have examples of Roman vessel bottoms.Apart from the Vatican, a blurb for Morey's catalogue mentions collections in: \\"Ostia Antica, Arezzo, Parma, Brescia, Turin, Catania, Florence, Bologna, Verona, Pesaro, Naples, London, Oxford, Barcelona, Tel-Aviv, Paris, Cologne, Bonn, Frankfurt, Wurzburg, Munich, Vienna and New York\\". (Abebooks) The largest collection is in the Vatican Museums, with the 60 pieces of Late Antique glass in the British Museum the second largest. A research project on their collection was due to finish in 2010 (see further reading below).Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection; see External links for many photos of the Vatican's collection The Wilshere Collection in the Ashmolean is the third largest, with some 34 pieces.Vickers describes the whole collection, on loan to the museum from Pusey House until bought in 2007. The glass is described at 609‚Äì613 The Corning Museum of Glass has 18 examples and the Metropolitan Museum in New York nearly as many. The most recent of many catalogues since the 18th century are by C.R. Morey in 1959, with 460 Roman vessel bases, against 426 in S. Smith's thesis of 2000.

Construction and commissioning Vega was ordered on 30 June 1916 as part of the 9th Order of the 1916‚Äì17 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 11 December 1916 by William Doxford & Sons at Sunderland, England, and launched on 1 September 1917. She was completed on 12 December 1917 and commissioned into service on 14 December 1917. Her original pennant number, F4A, was changed to F92 in January 1918 and to F09 in April 1918. It became D52 during the interwar period.Naval History: SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY, 1914‚Äì1919 ‚Äì in ALPHABETICAL ORDER (Part 2 of 2) Service history World War I Vega was assigned to the Grand Fleet or Harwich Force and saw service in the last year of World War I, suffering damage while operating with the fleet in 1918. Interwar years Vega was among the ships which accompanied the battlecruisers and during their visit to Scandinavian ports in June 1920. During the voyage, she and the destroyer tested the Royal Navys High Speed Mine Sweep, which the British Admiralty hoped to use in the shallow waters of the Baltic in the event of a war with Bolshevik Russia (soon to become the Soviet Union). In a blow to the Admiraltys plans, both destroyers lost their minesweeping apparatus, demonstrating the High Speed Mine Sweep to be impractical in shallow water.Moretz, Joseph, The Royal Navy and the Capital Ship in the Interwar Period: An Operational Perspective, New York: Routledge, 2002, page not numbered., In 1921, Vega was part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She later was placed in reserve and assigned to the Reserve Fleet. Under the 1939 Rearmament Programme, Vega was selected for conversion to an antiaircraft escort. In May 1939, she entered Chatham Dockyard to begin conversion. World War II =1939‚Äì1941= Vega was still undergoing conversion when the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, but in October 1939 she underwent her post-conversion acceptance trials and was selected for service escorting convoys in the North Sea. She reported to the Rosyth Escort Force in Scotland in November 1939 and began convoy duty in December 1939. Her pennant number became L41 when she reentered service in 1939. In May 1940, Vega was detached from her normal duties for operations in the English Channel related to requirements to evacuate Allied troops from Belgium and France and prevent the use of French ports by German forces, and she assisted in the evacuation of troops from Ostend and Zeebrugge, Belgium. On 26 May 1940, she served as the flagship for Operation Lyster, the sinking of two blockships at Zeebrugge. The following day, she joined the Polish Navy destroyer in a night reconnaissance of the harbor at Dunkirk, France, to determine whether Allied troops could be evacuated there; although two German aircraft attacked them and there were many wrecks in the harbor, they found it navigable, and the Royal Navy decided to send ships there to evacuate troops. On 10 June 1940 she escorted blockships to Dieppe, France, and, after they sank themselves to block the harbor there, supported the evacuation of Allied personnel from Le Havre, France. On 17 June 1940, she deployed to support Operation Aerial, the evacuation of Allied personnel from Saint-Nazaire, France, and other French ports on the Bay of Biscay. In July 1940, Vega returned to convoy duty in the North Sea. This came to an end on 11 November 1940, when she struck a naval mine off Sunk Head, Harwich, England, and suffered heavy damage. While still under repair in December 1941, she was \\"adopted\\" by the civil community of Godalming, Surrey, in a Warship Week fundraising campaign. =1942‚Äì1945= Vegas repairs were not completed until 14 November 1942. She emerged from them with Type 285 fire-control radar installed for her main guns, as well as a Type 286 air search radar to warn of the approach of aircraft. She returned to her convoy escort duties in the North Sea for the rest of World War II, and later had a Type 271 radar installed for the detection of submarines and motor torpedo boats. In 1943 she had radio telephone equipment installed to allow her to communicate with Royal Air Force aircraft during combat against German aircraft and S-boats (the motor torpedo boats known to the Allies as \\"E-boats\\"), as well as \\"Headache\\" (also known as \\"Y Outfit\\") radio receivers for the interception of E-boat communications. After the surrender of Germany in early May 1945, Vega operated in support of Allied reoccupation forces in Europe during the summer of 1945. Decommissioning and disposal After the armistice with Japan brought World War II to an end on 15 August 1945, Vega was decommissioned and placed in reserve. She was sold on 4 March 1947 to BISCO for scrapping by Clayton and Davies at Dunston on Tyne and arrived at the shipbreakers yard on 26 March 1947.

His official title is Founding Chairman of BETC and Global Chief Creative Officer of Havas. He is also the author of the book \\"BETC Paris ‚Äì Global Advertising Agency\\".  Career  Babinet's advertising career began in the late 1980s with internships at Saatchi & Saatchi, Y&R; and BDDP (now TBWA Paris). In 1986 BDDP hired him as a copywriter and he eventually rose to the position of Creative Director. During that period, and alongside art director partner Philippe Pollet-Villard, he produced campaigns for Polaroid, Virgin Megastore, BMW, McCain, Le Monde, Wonderbra, Galeries Lafayette and Canal+. In 1995, Babinet founded agency Babinet Tong Cuong alongside associate Eric Tong Cuong. Mercedes Erra joined them in 1995 and the agency was renamed Babinet Erra Tong Cuong Euro RSCG. Tong Cuong left the company in 2002. In July 2005, Babinet was made Chief Creative Officer of Euro RSCG Worldwide (today known as Havas Worldwide). From 2003 to 2007, Babinet was President of the French Art Directors Club and in June 2014, he will preside over the Press Jury at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. In May 2016, Forbes Magazine selected R√©mi Babinet as one of the world's 10 Best Creative Directors.  BETC  BETC, a French advertising agency, was co-founded by Babinet in 1995. Babinet has spoken extensively about what he believes sets BETC apart from other agencies. In an interview with Brazil's Meio & Mensagem publication, he claims the difference stems from two things: \\"The first is that we do not have a creative process formalized: No rules, no preconceived ideas.\\" The second is that they \\"do not believe in the culture of globalization, a mold that fits all. We believe that a strong brand globally needs to have powerful roots.\\" Building on that last idea, Babinet has said BETC makes a conscious effort to separate itself from how people perceive the French, a culture he calls \\"unique\\" but something people either \\"love or hate\\". He considers BETC an \\"international brand\\" that retains a French identity because of its work with renowned French brands, such as Air France, Evian and Lacoste. On advertising in general, Babinet has said he finds \\"simplicity is the most difficult of all to achieve.\\" He believes that advertising should engage with the world around it, creating new ways with which to interact with society and consumers. He has consistently challenged the traditional limits of advertising, opening up his agency to new creative fields and emerging talents: organisation of the mythic Panik parties with BETC POP, creation of the label POP Records, publishing of the book Graffiti General, programming of new spaces such as the gallery Passage du D√©sir and soon a new creative space open to the public in the Magasins g√©n√©raux in Pantin,With his influence,BETC has pushed the boundaries of advertising and has become a cultural and artistic driver. Creative Review defined it as ‚Äúalso an ad agency‚Äù. In 2008, Babinet wrote the book ‚ÄòBETC Paris‚Äô, distributed by BIS Publishers. The book is an overview of BETC's trajectory, work and agency culture, with a special focus on its efforts in music, fashion, design and photography. BETC London was opened in 2011, beginning the process of expansion of BETC Network. In 2014 BETC S√£o Paulo was opened, meeting the expectations of success in the local market. Babinet continues to act as Global Creative Director for several of BETC's largest clients, including Air France and Evian, whose ‚ÄúRollerbabies‚Äù campaign was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most-viewed online ad to date (45,166,109 views at the time of its 2009 distinction). In July 2016 BETC moved to Les Magasins g√©n√©raux in Pantin, a building dedicated to creation and innovation. BETC and in particular R√©mi will take a major role in the rehabilitation of the city with a great involvement in cultural and social activities for the inhabitants of its new Greater Paris area.  Personal life  R√©mi Babinet was born in 1957 in the Paris suburb of Suresnes. His father is a university law professor and his mother operates an independent children's bookstore in Strasbourg.

He is a practising Muslim, with outspoken views in favour of women's rights and against forced marriage, female genital mutilation and honour killings. Afzal spent most of his career in the Crown Prosecution Service, rising to be Chief Crown Prosecutor for North West England in 2011, a role he held until leaving the CPS in 2015. In April 2016 he was appointed chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, a post which comes with media restrictions; he resigned immediately after the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing so that he could comment freely on the attack. Since October 2017, he has been a member of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) Complaints Committee. In 2018, he became the Chair of the Corporation Board at Hopwood Hall College in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Early life and background Nazir Afzal was born in Birmingham, his parents having recently emigrated from Pakistan. His father and his father's family worked for generations in catering for the British Army, and one of his relatives was killed by the IRA at the height of The Troubles in Northern Ireland. His family is of Pashtun ethnicity. He grew up with seven siblings in a two-up two-down in Small Heath, Birmingham. He was bullied and racially abused throughout his childhood, those around him saw no point in reporting the incidents to the police. Following a racially-motivated attack, aged 13, his father told him \\"The Police are not interested in you [...] there is no justice\\". Afzal states that with this incident came the realization that racism \\"wasn't something I had to put up with. And I certainly wasn't going to spend the rest of my life running from abusers\\". Afzal obtained his law degree from the University of Birmingham before attending The College of Law in Guildford, where he developed his interest in criminal law. Career with the Crown Prosecution Service Afzal worked as a solicitor in Birmingham from 1988 until moving to London in 1991, where he became a Crown Prosecutor. In 2001, he became the youngest person, and first Muslim, to be appointed as assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor. In 2011, he was appointed North West Chief Crown Prosecutor covering Greater Manchester, Cumbria and Lancashire. At that point in his career, he made it clear that prosecutors are public figures and should be out there engaging with the people, explaining themselves via the media.\\" As one of the 13 chief crown prosecutors that cover England and Wales, he was responsible for over 100,000 prosecutions a year and managed 800 lawyers and paralegals. Afzal addressing Salford University in 2012 The first time one of Afzal's cases reached the national news was in August 1992, when the culprits were two supermarket employees who, following a works trip to the seaside, had sex in a crowded train back to London, and then lit up cigarettes in a no-smoking carriage. Afzal successfully prosecuted them for committing an indecent act and for smoking where not permitted to do so. This case was cited by an American academic in attempting to understand the British culture of tact. Another notable prosecution in his early career was that of serial killer Colin Ireland.> When he was promoted and moved to Manchester in 2011 he faced several high-profile cases, one involving a man killed while committing an aggravated burglary in which Afzal decided that the householder acted in reasonable self-defence. Afzal's team were responsible for the swift prosecution of that summer's looters, a judicial response described by an academic as \\"shock and awe\\". The Stepping Hill Hospital poisoning incident occurred that autumn, and 2011 closed with the unprovoked murder of a student from India. In 2012 he successfully prosecuted Dale Cregan, who was convicted of four murders (including that of two police officers) and three attempted murders, for which he was sentenced to a whole life order.  Violence, control, and gender  Afzal is best known for tackling cases involving violence against women and the sexual exploitation of children; the New York Times called him \\"Britain‚Äôs go-to prosecutor\\" for these areas. Until 2004, he had not been aware of forced marriages and honour crimes happening in the UK, but he was approached by a group of women with compelling testimony. They asked him to use his position to investigate, so he held a conference on the issues and set up a national database, cataloguing dozens of instances of potential crimes. 2005 saw the honour killing of Samaira Nazir; as area director for the CPS, Afzal was responsible for the prosecution of her relatives, and described the beliefs that led to her murder as \\"tragic and outdated\\". He thought that such traditional attitudes would die out with the older immigrant generation, but by 2008, by which time he was the CPS's lead on honour-based violence, he realised that young men held the same controlling beliefs about family honour and purity, and that education needed to start with primary school children to challenge this. \\"I have talked to loads of Muslim women and I can tell you that the greatest fear they have is not Islamophobia or being attacked by racists or being arrested on suspicion of terrorism. It is from within their own family.\\" One of his first decisions on becoming a chief crown prosecutor was to initiate prosecutions in the case of the Rochdale sex trafficking gang, overturning an earlier decision by the CPS. He suggested that \\"white professionals' over-sensitivity to political correctness and fear of appearing racist may well have contributed to justice being stalled\\". He said \\"I do feel that there's a deficit of leadership in some parts of the Muslim community. They could be much more challenging of certain behaviours\\". He attributed the attacks to \\"evil men\\", saying that the key driver was \\"male power\\". A New York Times profile said: Afzal's work against grooming gangs led to criticism from \\"members of the Asian community\\" and a campaign to have him sacked and deported by the far right. Despite his actions being the catalyst for the successful prosecution of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring, he was targeted by the English Defence League and door- stepped by Nick Griffin, resulting in him needing Police protection. Regarding far-right campaigns to deport Afzal, he reiterated \\"I was born in Birmingham. They can deport me to Birmingham if they want to\\", and said \\"I think if you are getting it from both sides, you are probably getting something right.\\" He used his position to stress that abusers were found in all communities, and that the vast majority of paedophiles in Britain are white. In May 2013, he was responsible for the prosecution of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall, who was convicted of multiple sexual offences against girls and women. He promised to turn the attention of the CPS to forced marriage in the Traveller community, which he claimed was rife. Afzal put forward the theory, also proposed by Rochdale's then-MP Simon Danczuk, that one explanation for the profile of the town's abusers was the prevalence of Pakistani-origin men in the night-time economy, i.e. as taxi drivers and workers in take-away shops. In March 2015 it was reported that Afzal was leaving the CPS. A CPS spokesman said \\"Nazir Afzal is leaving the service as part of [an] on-going drive for efficiency\\" and that \\"there has been no impropriety on the part of Mr Afzal\\". Career After Leaving the CPS Once he left the CPS, Afzal began to speak even more widely, and found a large audience for his messages, that violence against women infects all communities, that authorities are still unwilling to believe the victims, and that there is a deficit of leadership in the British Muslim community. \\"Having prosecuted perpetrators from more than 60 countries and [dealt with] victims from more than 50 countries, I know there isn't any community where women and girls are safe. It's a power thing and power sadly infects every community and therefore our responsibility has to begin with listening to victims and survivors.\\" He draws parallels between the way gangs groom children for sexual exploitation and the way Islamists lure young people into radicalisation. Both prey on young people who feel unwanted, unloved and are more likely to be open to manipulation, Afzal argued. He explained that strategies to target radicalisation had to appeal more to young people and called for more community-led efforts to combat the forces of radicalisation. Afzal became chief executive of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners in 2016. He resigned from this post, which restricted his political expression, after the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017 in order to express his views on the topical BBC television programme Question Time. In 2017 he joined the Complaints Committee of the Independent Press Standards Organisation as its first BAME member. In January 2018 he was appointed, alongside Yasmin Khan of the Halo Project, as an advisor to the Welsh government on issues around violence against women. He \\"has pledged to make Wales one of the safest places in Europe to be a woman.\\" He often speaks and writes about how much depends on the undervalued leadership of women in small charities, working to combat gender-based problems and extremism in their own communities. In September 2018 he became Chair of the Corporation Board of Hopwood Hall College. Previous education positions included a Pro- Vice Chancellorship of the University of West London. He is Honorary Lecturer in law at University of Manchester and Pro-Chancellor at Brunel University, London. In December 2018, Afzal reported Tommy Robinson, the founder of English Defence League, after Robinson had interviewed the 16-year-old suspect related to assault on Syrian refugees at Almondbury Community School. Afzal suggested posting material naming the boy was unlawful.  Critical of Government Cuts  Afzal has been an outspoken critic of government cuts to the Crown Prosecution Service and Ministry of Justice. He stated that a tipping point had been reached in 2015: cuts would lead to a reduction in the number of senior staff, which would force the junior staff members to do more and more with less resources while being under increasing scrutiny. He claimed the cuts were one of the reasons that he decided to leave the CPS. In 2019, he said the cuts and other lack of resources were responsible for a drastic fall in rape prosecutions and convictions, leading to him to conclude that rape has \\"effectively been decriminalised.\\" In 2019, Afzal revealed that he met with Boris Johnson (who was then not yet Prime Minister) in 2016. Afzal warned Johnson that government cutbacks meant that incarcerated terrorists were being released early; however, these individuals remained radicalized and thus were likely to commit acts of terror again. Afzal urged Johnson to increased funding for efforts to de-radicalize these prisoners, but he was told that such funding would not be available. Afzal revealed the conversation after Johnson, then as Prime Minister, criticized the policy of early release for terrorists in August of 2019.  Mediation of LGBT Education in Schools  In 2019, Parkfield Community School near Birmingham asked Afzal to mediate the issue on LGBT inclusive education. Some parents began protesting over the inclusion, fearing that adding lessons that include gay people were \\"promoting LGBT ways of life.\\" The school argued that such education prevented homophobia. After analyzing the issue in depth, Afzal concluded that removing LGBT inclusion from education did ‚Äúno service at all and no good at all.\\" He also stated that school environments should be used ‚Äúas somewhere they can learn things that they wouldn‚Äôt learn anywhere else‚Äù. He also warned that failing to teach children properly about sex and relationships could possibly lead to them being exploited by grooming gangs. Afzal stated that he feared some parents were being manipulated by outsiders with a different agenda. He said, \\"I have examined the curriculum myself and there is no specific LGBT content, no reference to gay sex, none at all - there is reference, as there should be, to equality.\\" Memoir Afzal's memoir \\"The Prosecutor\\", published in April 2020, was described by Richard Scorer in the New Law Journal as \\"an inspiring account of the career of an outstanding public servant\\". Writing in The Sunday Times' Rosamund Urwin called it a \\"fast-paced memoir\\" which \\"explores what led him to become a champion of the ignored\\". Representations in popular culture When he was director of the Crown Prosecution Service for London West, the TV police procedural Law & Order: UK used him \\"for guidance on plot lines and realism\\" and designed the set to mimic his office. The BBC three-part drama Three Girls, based on the Rochdale scandal, was broadcast on consecutive nights 16‚Äì18 May 2017 and featured the actor Ace Bhatti playing Afzal. Honours and awards Afzal was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2005 New Year Honours. The Manchester Evening News reported that Afzal had \\"received the CPS Public Servant of the Year award, the UK Government's Justice Award and the Daily Mirror newspaper 'People‚Äôs Award'... the Law Society/Bar Council Mentoring award and was selected for the Asian Power 100 along with the Muslim Power 100 list.\\" He was made a Fellow of the University of Central Lancashire in 2013 for \\"raising public awareness of domestic violence, forced marriage and 'honour' based crimes\\". In January 2013, Afzal was awarded the Services to Law award at the British Muslim Awards. He was named Legal Personality of the Year by the Society of Asian Lawyers. He received honorary doctorates in Law from the University of Birmingham in 2014, from the University of Manchester in 2017 and the University of Leicester in 2019. Personal life Afzal has been married three times, which he describes humorously as \\"multifaith engagement\\": \\"First to an Irish Catholic, then to an Indian Hindu and then to a British Sikh.\\" He has one daughter and three sons and is a practising Muslim. In June 2020, Afzal's brother died due to COVID-19, and Afzal was unable to go to the funeral. This experience led him to call for the CPS, the Metropolitan Police and Durham Constabulary reopen and fully investigate claims that the prime minister's adviser Dominic Cummings may have broken laws during the pandemic lockdown.

The three girls were imprisoned until May 6, 2013, when Berry escaped with her six-year-old daughter, to whom she had given birth while imprisoned, and contacted the police. Police rescued Knight and DeJesus and arrested Castro within hours. On May 8, 2013, Castro was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. He pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison without the possibility of parole. On September 3, 2013, one month into his sentence, Castro died by suicide after hanging himself with bed sheets in his prison cell. Perpetrator background Ariel Castro (July 10, 1960 - September 3, 2013) was born in Duey, Yauco, Puerto Rico, the son of Pedro Castro (1938‚Äì2004) and Lillian Rodriguez (born 1942). Castro's parents divorced when he was a child, and he moved to mainland United States with his mother and three full siblings. They settled in Reading, Pennsylvania, and then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where Castro's father and other family members were living. Castro had nine siblings (both full and half) and graduated from Cleveland's Lincoln-West High School in 1979. Castro met his girlfriend Grimilda Figueroa when his family moved into a house across the street from hers in the 1980s. They lived with both sets of parents, but moved into their own home at 2207 Seymour Avenue in 1992. Their home was a two-story, , four-bedroom, one- bathroom house with a unfinished basement built in 1890 and remodeled in 1956. Figueroa's sister Elida Caraballo said that \\"all hell started breaking loose\\" when the couple moved into their new home. Caraballo and her husband Frank claim that Castro beat Figueroa, breaking her nose, ribs, and arms and causing a blood clot on her brain that resulted in an inoperable tumor. He also threw her down a flight of stairs, cracking her skull. In 1993, Castro was arrested for domestic violence but was not indicted by a grand jury. Figueroa moved out of the home in 1996 and secured custody of her four children. Police assisted in the move and detained Castro, but they did not press charges. Castro continued to threaten and attack Figueroa after she left him, according to Caraballo. Figueroa filed charges in 2005 in Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court accusing him of inflicting multiple severe injuries on her and of \\"frequently\\" abducting their daughters. The court granted her a temporary restraining order against Castro, but it was dismissed a few months later. Figueroa died in April 2012 due to complications from her brain tumor. Friends and relatives gathered on Denison Avenue on April 29, 2012, for memorial services in her honor. Before his arrest at age 52, Castro worked as a bus driver for the Cleveland Metropolitan School District until he was fired for \\"bad judgment\\", including making an illegal U-turn with children on his bus, using his bus to go grocery shopping, leaving a child on the bus while he went for lunch, and leaving the bus unattended while he took a nap at home. He was earning $18.91 per hour when he was discharged. At the time of his arrest, Castro's home was in foreclosure after three years of unpaid real estate taxes. Kidnappings Castro's home at 2207 Seymour Avenue; it was demolished on August 7, 2013, as part of Castro's plea bargain Castro kidnapped his victims by offering them a ride; he drove each to his home, lured them inside, took them to the basement, and restrained them Also published by the Chicago Tribune as . in his house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, located in Cleveland's residential Tremont neighborhood. The house has since been demolished. Michelle Knight Michelle Knight (born April 23, 1981) disappeared on August 23, 2002, after leaving a cousin's house. She was 21 years old at the time. On the day of her disappearance, she was scheduled to appear in court for a child custody case involving her son Joey, who was in the custody of the state. Following Knight's rescue, police acknowledged that limited resources had been spent on investigating her disappearance, in part because she was an adult. Authorities believed that she had run away voluntarily due to anger over losing custody of her son. According to Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba, she was \\"the focus of very few tips\\". Some have criticized her removal from the National Crime Information Center database. This event happened 15 months after she disappeared, so she was largely unknown prior to her rescue. Cleveland Police and the FBI maintain that her inclusion or exclusion had no bearing on her rescue. Amanda Berry Amanda Marie Berry (born April 22, 1986) disappeared on April 21, 2003, the day before her 17th birthday. She was last heard from around 8 p.m. when she called her sister to tell her that she was getting a ride home from her job at a Burger King at West 110th Street and Lorain Avenue. The FBI initially considered her a runaway until a week after her disappearance, when an unidentified male used her cell phone to call her mother. He said: \\"I have Amanda. She's fine and will be coming home in a couple of days\\". Berry was featured in a 2004 segment of Fox's America's Most Wanted (re-aired in 2005 and 2006), which linked her to Gina DeJesus, who by that point had also gone missing in Cleveland. Berry and DeJesus were profiled on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Montel Williams Show, where self-proclaimed psychic Sylvia Browne told Berry's mother Louwana Miller in 2004 that her daughter was dead and that she was \\"in water\\". This pronouncement devastated her mother, causing her to take down pictures and give away Berry's computer. However, Miller continued to search for Berry before dying from heart failure in early March 2006. Later that year, on December 25, 2006, Berry gave birth to a daughter. DNA evidence has confirmed that Castro was the father of the child. Robert Wolford was a prison inmate who had lived in Tremont, and he claimed in July 2012 that he had information about the location of Berry's body. He led police to an empty lot on Cleveland's West Side, where they conducted a fruitless search. He was sentenced in January 2013 to 4¬Ω years in prison for obstruction of justice, making a false report, and making a false alarm. Gina DeJesus 2004 FBI sketch of a suspect in DeJesus' disappearance Georgina \\"Gina\\" Lynn DeJesus (born February 13, 1990) went missing at age 14. She was last seen at a payphone around 3 p.m. on April 2, 2004, on the way home from her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain Avenue. Figueroa and Castro's daughter Arlene had called Figueroa for permission to have a sleepover at DeJesus's house, but Figueroa replied that they could not and the two girls parted ways. Arlene was the last person to see DeJesus before her disappearance. DeJesus was under the impression that Castro was picking her up to drop her off at home, and she trusted Castro because she was friends with his teenage daughter. No one witnessed her abduction, and an AMBER Alert was not issued, which angered her father. He said in 2006, \\"The Amber Alert should work for any missing child. ... Whether it's an abduction or a runaway, a child needs to be found. We need to change this law\\". A year after her disappearance, the FBI released a composite sketch and description of a male suspect, described as \\"Latino, 25 to 35 years of age, , , with green eyes, a goatee, and possibly a pencil-thin beard\\". According to court records, Castro was , , with brown eyes and a goatee. DeJesus was featured in the America's Most Wanted segment which linked her to Berry. The disappearances received regular media attention into 2012, while the families held public vigils. Castro attended at least two of these vigils, reportedly participated in a search party, and tried to get close to the DeJesus family. Castro's son Anthony was a journalism student in 2004, and he interviewed DeJesus's mother for an article about the disappearances in the Plain Press. Police kept the investigation open and offered a $25,000 reward for information. According to Castro's uncle, his family knew the DeJesus family and had lived in the same West Cleveland neighborhood. Castro eventually claimed that he was not aware that DeJesus was a member of that family when he abducted her. Captivity Castro kidnapped Knight, took her upstairs, tied her hands and feet together, and pulled her up using her hands, feet, and neck. He left her there for three days without food. Prosecutors at Castro's sentencing wrote that diaries kept by the women \\"speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war, of missing the lives they once enjoyed, of emotional abuse, of his threats to kill, of being treated like an animal, of continuous abuse, and of desiring freedom\\". The women were kept in locked upstairs bedrooms, where they were forced to use plastic toilets that were \\"emptied infrequently\\". They were fed one meal a day and allowed to shower twice a week at most. Knight told police that Castro had impregnated her at least five times and had induced miscarriages each time through beatings, hitting her with dumbbells, punching her, and slamming her against walls. He also starved her. Knight's grandmother told reporters that she would require facial reconstruction surgery due to the beatings that she endured, and she lost hearing in one ear. At one point, she had a pet dog while in captivity, but Castro killed it by snapping its neck after it bit him while trying to protect Knight. DeJesus told law enforcement that she was raped but did not believe that she was ever impregnated. On Christmas Day 2006, Castro allegedly ordered Knight to assist in the birth of Berry's child, which took place in a small inflatable swimming pool, and he threatened to kill her if the baby did not survive. At one point, the baby stopped breathing, but Knight was able to resuscitate her. Castro occasionally took her out of the house, including to visit his mother; she called him \\"daddy\\" and Castro's mother \\"grandmother\\". In 2013, he showed one of his adult daughters a picture of her and said that she was his girlfriend's daughter from a previous relationship. He had told others that she was his granddaughter. Berry taught her daughter how to read and write. According to a statement from Cleveland Police, officers visited Castro's home only once following the kidnappings to discuss an unrelated incident. Castro did not appear to be home at the time and was later interviewed elsewhere. Neighbors claimed to have called the police about suspicious activity observed at the home, but police have said that they have no record of any such calls. Also published by WHNT as \\"Ariel Castro Charged with Kidnapping, Rape; Brothers Pedro and Onil Released \\". Castro's son Anthony reported that there were certain areas of the house that were inaccessible due to being locked. Also published by NewsNet5.com (WEWS-TV) as \\"Family friend: Kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro was friends with Gina DeJesus' father, helped search \\" He also mentioned an occasion three weeks before the women's escape when Castro asked him if Berry would ever be found. Anthony said that he told Castro that Berry was likely dead, to which Castro responded: \\"Really? You think so?\\" NBC affiliate WKYC reported that Castro recalled each of the three abductions in great detail during his interrogation and indicated that they were unplanned crimes of opportunity. According to WKYC's sources, Castro did not have an \\"exit plan\\" and believed that he would eventually be caught. He referred to himself as \\"coldblooded\\" and a sex addict. Police found a suicide note in his home in which he discussed the abductions and wrote that his money and possessions should be given to the kidnapped women if he were caught. Escape and rescue On May 6, 2013, Berry was finally able to make contact with Castro's neighbors, leading to her escape with her 6-year-old daughter and the rescue of DeJesus and Knight by authorities. According to police, Castro left the house that day and Berry realized that he failed to lock the \\"big inside door\\", although the exterior storm door was bolted. She did not attempt to break through the outer door because she thought that Castro \\"was testing her\\", according to the police report. Previously, Castro had tested the women by leaving the house partially unlocked and exits unsecured. If they attempted to escape, he beat them. Instead, Berry screamed for help when she saw neighbors through the screen. Neighbor Angel Cordero responded to the screaming but was unable to communicate with Berry because he spoke little English. Neighbor Charles Ramsey joined Cordero at the house's front door during the rescue. They kicked a hole through the bottom of the storm door and Berry crawled through, carrying her daughter. Ramsey said that Berry told him that she and her child were being kept inside the house against her will. Upon being freed, she went to the house of another Spanish-speaking neighbor and, with Ramsey's assistance, called 9-1-1, saying \\"Help me, I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for ten years. And I'm here. I'm free now!\\" Responding police officers entered Castro's house. They walked through an upstairs hallway with guns drawn, announcing themselves as Cleveland Police. After peeking out from a slightly opened bedroom door, Knight entered the hallway and leaped into an officer's arms, repeatedly saying, \\"You saved me.\\" Soon afterward, DeJesus entered the hallway from another room. Knight and DeJesus walked out of the home, and all three women, plus the child, were taken to MetroHealth Medical Center. Berry and DeJesus were released from the hospital the next day, and Knight was discharged four days later on May 10. The rescue of the women also reignited hope for the family of Ashley Summers, another young woman who disappeared in the Cleveland area in early July 2007. after leaving her home after a dispute with her parents. Police initially believed that there could be other captives in the Seymour Avenue home, but found none. , Summers is still missing. Arrest and legal proceedings Screenshot showing Castro's interrogation by the FBI Castro was arrested on May 6, 2013. He was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape on May 8, which carry prison sentences of ten years to life in Ohio. Two of Castro's brothers were also initially taken into custody, but were released on May 9 after police announced that they had no involvement in the kidnappings. Castro made his first court appearance at the Cleveland Municipal Court on May 9, where bail was set at $2 million per kidnapping charge, adding to a total of $8 million. Additional charges were reported to be pending, including aggravated murder (for intentional induction of miscarriages), attempted murder, assault, a charge for each instance of rape, and a kidnapping charge for each day each captive was held. On May 14, Castro's attorneys said he would plead \\"not guilty\\" to all charges if indicted for kidnapping and rape. A Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment against Castro on June 7. It contained 329 counts, including two counts of aggravated murder (under different sections of the Ohio criminal code) for his role in the termination of one of the women's pregnancies. The indictments covered only the period from August 2002 to February 2007. The county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, stated that the investigation was ongoing, and that any further findings would be presented to the grand jury. McGinty said that pursuing a death penalty specification would be considered following completion of indictment proceedings. After entering a not guilty plea for Castro on June 12, one of his attorneys, Craig Weintraub, said that although some of the charges against Castro were indisputable, \\"it is our hope that we can continue to work toward a resolution to avoid having an unnecessary trial about aggravated murder and the death penalty\\". He noted, \\"We are very sensitive to the emotional strain and impact that a trial would have on the women, their families and this community\\". Castro was found competent to stand trial on July 3. On July 12, a Cuyahoga County grand jury returned a true bill of indictment for the remainder of the period after February 2007. It brought the total to 977 counts: 512 counts of kidnapping, 446 of rape, seven of gross sexual imposition, six of felonious assault, three of child endangerment, two of aggravated murder, and one of possession of criminal tools. On July 17, Castro pleaded not guilty to the expanded indictment. Castro pleaded guilty on July 26 to 937 of the 977 charges against him, including charges of kidnapping, rape, and aggravated murder, as part of a plea bargain which called for consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 1,000 years, all without parole. Under the plea deal, Castro forfeited his right to appeal, and could not profit in any way due to his crimes. He also forfeited his assets, including his home, which prosecutors said would be demolished. Castro was told by Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Michael Russo, \\"You will not be getting out. Is that clear?\\" to which Castro responded, \\"I do understand that, your honor.\\" Castro also made comments about his \\"addiction to pornography\\" and \\"sexual problem\\", but was cut off by Judge Russo, who said such issues could be discussed at the August 1 sentencing hearing. A law firm representing Berry, DeJesus, and Knight released a statement that the three women were \\"relieved by today's plea. They are satisfied by this resolution to the case, and are looking forward to having these legal proceedings draw to a final close in the near future\\". At the sentencing hearing on August 1, Castro was sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison, plus 1,000 years, all without any possibility of parole. He was also fined $100,000. The court forfeited all of his property and assets to the Cuyahoga County government. Before his sentencing, Castro addressed the court for nearly twenty minutes, in which he said he was \\"a good person\\" and \\"not a monster\\", but that he was addicted to sex and pornography, and had \\"practiced the art of masturbation\\" from a young age. He claimed that he had never beaten or tortured the women, and insisted that \\"most\\" of the sex he had with them \\"was consensual\\". He shifted between apologizing and blaming the FBI for failing to catch him, as well as blaming his victims themselves for getting in a car with a stranger, along with insisting to the court that when he had sex with them he discovered they were not virgins. He would alternatively shift back into apologetic comments, saying: \\"I hope they can find in their hearts to forgive me because we had a lot of harmony going on in that home\\". The sentencing judge also heard from Knight and family members of Berry and DeJesus. Knight told Castro: \\"You took eleven years of my life away. I spent eleven years in hell, now your hell is just beginning. I will overcome all that has happened, but you will face hell for eternity. I will live on, you will die a little every day as you think of the eleven years of atrocities that you inflicted on us ... I can forgive you, but I will never forget.\\" Aftermath Survivors Knight, Berry, and DeJesus released a video statement on July 9, 2013, thanking the public for their support. An attorney for Berry and DeJesus said that the women \\"still have a strong desire for privacy\\" and did not wish to speak to the media about their ordeal. The Cleveland Courage Fund is a bank account set up to help the women in their transition to independent life which had collected approximately $1.05 million at the time of the video's release. Before Berry's disappearance, her grandfather had promised to give her a classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo, built in the year when she was born. He kept the car after her kidnapping in case she was still found alive. He still had it for her when she was released, although it was in need of restoration from having been unused. Several automotive shops offered to perform the restoration for free. Knight discussed some of her ordeals in an interview with People Magazine one year after her release, as well as her life leading up to her abduction. Since her rescue, she legally changed her name to Lily Rose Lee, and began to get several tattoos as her way of coping with the healing process. She also revealed that her son was adopted by his foster parents while she was in captivity and that she wanted to see him, but she does not want to bring him into the ordeal which she has had to deal with, and planned to see him after he becomes an adult. She planned to open a restaurant and dreamed of getting married, which she did in 2016, and hopes to adopt children, as her years of abuse and torture have made it unlikely for her to ever be able to give birth again. She also planned to reunite with Berry and DeJesus in the future, but began focusing on getting her own life back on track. Berry and DeJesus received honorary diplomas from John Marshall High School in 2015. In an interview with WKYC-TV, DeJesus says that she is currently volunteering for the Amber Alert committee, offering comfort to families of abducted children. She remains in touch with Berry and her family. In February 2017, Berry joined the staff of WJW (Fox 8) in Cleveland, where she hosts short recurring segments in which she reports missing person cases. She does this to help families reunite with missing family members. In April 2019, Berry reunited with Charles Ramsey, six years since her rescue, at an interview that was broadcast by Fox 8. House demolition The site on Seymour Avenue in June 2014. As part of the plea bargain, the house where Castro had lived and held the women captive was demolished on August 7, 2013. Knight was present and handed out yellow balloons to spectators, which she said represented missing children. The balloons were released before DeJesus's aunt began the demolition with a swing of a crane. The house has been completely blurred out on the street view of Google Maps.  Castro's death  Castro was found hanging from a bed sheet in his detention cell at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, Ohio, on the evening of September 3, 2013, one month into his life sentence. He was 53 at the time of his death. Prison staff performed CPR on him before he was taken to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, where he was pronounced dead shortly after. The following day, Franklin County coroner Jan Gorniak announced that a preliminary autopsy had found the cause of Castro's death to be suicide by hanging. On October 10, 2013, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction released a report which suggested that Castro may have died accidentally from auto-erotic asphyxiation rather than suicide. Gorniak rejected the possibility, standing by her ruling of suicide. The report also said that two prison guards had falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro hours before he was found dead. Castro was not on suicide watch at the time of his death but had been subjected to routine checks every 30 minutes due to his notoriety. A consultant's report was released on December 3, and officially concluded that \\"all available evidence pointed to suicide, including a shrine-like arrangement of family pictures and a Bible in Castro's cell, an increasing tone of frustration in his prison journal and the reality of spending the rest of his life in prison while subject to constant harassment.\\" The Ohio State Highway Patrol also reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion.

Although geographically distant from the main theaters of war, Colombia played an important role in World War II because of its strategic location near the Panama Canal, and its access to both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Colombia also experienced major changes to its military and society, due to increased influence from the United States, but it was also able to maintain its sovereignty throughout the war, as well as avoid sending troops into battle. Colombia ceased diplomatic relations with the Axis powers in December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, it allowed the U.S. to station troops in the country and finally entered the war on the Allies' side on November 26, 1943, after a series of German U-boat attacks on Colombian ships. Despite the declaration, Colombia did not send an army overseas, but its navy was active in countering U-boat operations in the Caribbean. History Economics The economic dislocation created by World War II impacted Colombia significantly. Firstly, Colombia was cut off from European and Asian markets, leaving the United States as its primary market for exports. Secondly, Colombia's imports were also dramatically affected, and again the United States was the sole source of many goods, such as rayon yarn, steel, machinery, graphite, and lead. One of the primary concerns was the price of coffee, Colombia's largest export and the main source of its foreign exchange. The American Office of Price Administration (OPA) attempted to have the maximum price of coffee frozen at the level existing on December 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, Colombia objected on the basis that the cost of producing and transporting coffee had increased due to wartime conditions, and, if the price was not adjusted to factor in these conditions, the economy would decline. The OPA relented, and agreed to raise prices immediately and to adjust them in the future based on increased production and transportation costs. Colombia's source of platinum was another important issue. Colombia was the only source of platinum for the German and Japanese war industries, and the United States moved quickly to buy out the entire supply through the Metals Reserve Company, which was an agency of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Since the United States also needed additional supplies of platinum for its war effort, it assisted Colombia with technical advice on increasing production through the Foreign Economic Administration. Because platinum was so valuable, even in small amounts, and Axis agents were willing to pay premium prices, smuggling became a problem. Accordingly, Colombia attempted to control the export of platinum by requiring all producers to sell their product to the Central Bank only. However, producers in remote areas were able to circumvent government control by selling their product on the black market in Argentina. The smuggling of platinum out of Colombia remained a problem for most of the war, but it was reduced to a \\"trickle\\" by late 1944. Immigrants from Axis countries At the beginning of the war, Colombia was home to a German colony - estimated by the United States government in December 1941 to consist of about 4,000 people - and a small village of Japanese farmers in Cauca. The Americans were concerned about the possibility of a \\"fifth column\\" of subversives forming in Colombia and carrying out sabotage and the like against the nearby Panama Canal Zone. However, this view, in most instances, was not shared by the Colombian government. To be sure, there were some Axis agitators, such as the businessman Emil Prufert in Barranquilla, but the Colombian government was not convinced that all immigrants from Axis countries were enemy agents. Even though the Colombian government was mostly in doubt about the presence of enemy agents operating in their country, the United States through Lend-Lease was providing the former with economic assistance to counter enemy agent activity, and constantly had to remind the Colombian government that the aid would be cut off if it did not acknowledge the threat. The benefits of American economic assistance, and threats to cut it off, were irresistible, however, and as result, Colombia monitored, interned, or deported hundreds of people from Germany, Japan, and Italy, during the war. ;SCADTA One example of American pressure to \\"crack down\\" on immigrants from Axis countries was the SCADTA case. SCADTA was founded in 1919 by three German settlers and five Colombians, and by World War II was an important part of the transportation network of Colombia. In 1931, after the American-owned Pan American World Airways acquired a controlling interest in SCADTA, it was discovered that many of the airline's pilots, technicians, and key administrators were German or Austrian, even though most had lived in Colombia for several years. Some of the pilots had even retained reserve commissions in the Luftwaffe. The United States was afraid that the SCADTA pilots were engaged in espionage, and could be plotting to convert civilian aircraft into bombers, in order to attack the Panama Canal. The Colombian government was not concerned about SCADTA, though, and did not question the loyalty of the German pilots. However, in order to comply with the United States, Colombia passed laws requiring airlines to hire more Colombian citizens, and for 51% of the stock of these companies to be Colombian-held. Restrictions were also placed on German pilots on how they could be utilized by an airline. For example, at least one pilot on every plane had to be Colombian, and positioning devices were placed on all of SCADTA's planes so that the government could monitor their location. The Military Forces of Colombia In 1939, the average numerical strength of the Colombian Army stood at 16,000 men. It was made up of six mixed brigades, with each mixed brigade consisting of three battalions, one cavalry group of three squadrons, one artillery group of three batteries, one engineer battalion, and two service battalions. The army's air force component consisted of one service squadron and one training squadron of fifteen aircraft. The police numbered 5,053 officers, and by 1944 the number had increased to 5,500. Colombia nominally had a compulsory military service but it was never fully enforced. Active service lasted for a period of one year. In 1939, the Colombian Navy had a total of approximately 1,850 personnel, including naval infantry. It possessed two modern destroyers, both of which had been purchased in Portugal, four river gunboats, one seagoing gunboat, three coastguard patrol vessels, and several customs service motor launches. In the 1930s, the Colombian Air Force was only in initial stages of development; in 1935 the very first flight was created, but it was only during World War II that shipments of aircraft from the United States allowed for a more significant development of the air force, eventually transforming it into a separate branch of the armed forces. Three air force groups were formed in 1943. ;Cooperation with the United States Close cooperation between the United States military and the Military Forces of Colombia began during World War II. Prior to the beginning of the war in 1939, Switzerland and the United Kingdom provided Colombia with military aviation and naval support. However, the Swiss aviation equipment was expensive and obsolete by 1939, and the Colombian government recognized the possibility that the British would most likely not be able to continue their naval assistance due to their own defense needs. Conveniently, American naval and military aviation missions arrived in Colombia in January 1939. The United States and Colombia also began a series of consultations on the defense of the Panama Canal. After the Fall of France in 1940, the need for cooperation became more urgent. In September, the two countries began to work out agreements for a military alliance. Colombia agreed to prevent any attack on the Panama Canal or the United States from its territory, and if Colombia came under attack by a non-American power, the United States would respond accordingly, but only if requested by the Colombian government. If the United States supported another American republic in time of war, as result of an inter-American agreement, Colombia would allow the United States use of its military facilities. Other points of the agreement included the exchange of technical advisers, cooperation on coastal patrols, and the aerial photographing of strategic areas within Colombia. On the issue of aerial photography, Colombia made it clear that it would only be accomplished by Colombian aircraft and American cameramen. Colombia also made it clear that, although it was fully supportive of the fight against the Axis, it would do everything possible to limit the amount of American military activity taking place on or from its territory. The Colombians did not invite the United States to build its own military bases within their country, as Ecuador and other South American countries did. They felt that the defense of Colombia should be carried out by Colombians, and the United States did not object. As result of the alliance, Colombia was able to modernize both its military and society at large. In addition to the naval and aviation missions established in the early years of the war, Colombia later participated in the Lend-Lease program. On March 17, 1942, Colombia and the United States signed an agreement that granted the former $16.5 million in military assistance. The terms of the agreement were most favorable, because Colombia was able to purchase military equipment at half the regular cost, and also did not have to pay interest on its purchases. Other favorable loans and grants soon followed. For example, the Export-Import Bank provided $20 million for highway construction, $10.3 million for agricultural programs, and another $3.5 million to build a hydroelectric plant. It also issued a loan for low-cost housing construction. In addition, American private investment soared to more than $200 million by 1943. The Battle of the Caribbean Map of Colombia ;Attacks on Colombian ships German U-boats sank at least four Colombian ships during World War II, all of which were small sailing vessels. The first victim was the SS Resolute, a 35-ton schooner with a crew of ten men. On June 23, 1942, the Resolute was stopped near San Andres and Old Providence by 20-mm gunfire from the . Shortly thereafter, the Colombians abandoned ship, and the Germans boarded to sink the little schooner with hand grenades. Six of the Colombians were killed as result, and the four survivors claimed that the Germans shot at them with machine guns before sailing away. The SS Roamar was the next to be sunk. A 110-ton schooner, the Roamar belonged to a Colombian diplomat, and her sinking off San Andres by on July 21, 1942, gave Colombia the political grounds to declare war on Germany. The Germans knew that Colombia was still neutral at this time, so they opted to sink the Roamar quickly, before anybody could find out. Accordingly, the Germans fired only two shots before the ship was reduced to \\"nothing but splintered debris.\\" U-505s engineer, Hans Goebeler, said the following about the incident: \\"We couldn't leave the evidence [of attacking a neutral ship] floating around, so we sank her with the deck gun.\\" This was not the last ship sunk by the Germans during Colombia's neutrality period. On the very next day, the U-505 sank the 153-ton Urious in the same area, killing thirteen of the Colombian sailors on board. Another Colombian ship sunk by the Germans was the SS Ruby, a 39-ton schooner with a complement of eleven men. On the morning of November 18, 1943, Ruby was north of Col√≥n and on course between San Andres and Cartagena, when she was fired on by the deck gun of . Thirty rounds later, the Ruby was sinking, and four men had been killed. ;The U-154 Incident Colombia's only notable engagement with Axis forces during the war was a brief incident in the Caribbean Sea between the destroyer ARC Caldas and the . On the night of March 29, 1944, at 20:25, a lookout aboard the Caldas sighted a periscope off the portside. After closing the distance, in the darkness the Colombians found U-154 sailing on the surface. The Germans were completely surprised by the sudden appearance of the enemy destroyer, so they were unable to get their deck gun into action in time, and instead had to dive to prevent being hit by Colombian gunfire. According to the Colombian Navy's report of the incident, the men aboard Caldas struck the U-boat twice with 105-mm gunfire before it dived, and then finished it off with depth charges. An oil slick and some wreckage were spotted, and it seemed to confirm the sinking. Overall, the engagement lasted no longer than three minutes, and afterward the Caldas sailed back to port, without looking for survivors. When the Caldas arrived back at port at 03:30 the next morning, news of the \\"victory\\" had already spread. However, the U-154 escaped without damage. Using spare oil and some damaged torpedo tubes, the Germans were able to fake the oil slick and wreckage the Colombians saw the night before, and slip away unscathed. Newspapers were quick to produce inaccurate reports of the engagement. An article in TIME, for example, claimed that the sunken submarine was not German, but in fact an American vessel. Others spread news of how the Caldas avenged those who had died aboard the sunken schooners. Ultimately, U-154 met her end off Madeira, on July 3, 1944, when she was sunk with all hands lost by the American destroyer escorts and . The Pasto Coup In the early 1940s, politically motivated violence was again on the rise in Colombia, and was described as \\"intense\\" in the country's eastern plains region. Although the Liberal Party (PL), under the leadership of President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo, retained control of the government until 1946, the party and, in particular, its rural supporters had become the targets for increasingly violent attacks by adherents of the Conservative Party (PC). Much of the violence was motivated by the perceived threat posed to the minority PC and the vested interests of its members by the PL's reformist agenda. The situation came to a head in July 1944 when a group of disgruntled officers stationed in the southern Colombian town of Pasto, near the Ecuadoran border, attempted to end Pumarejo's presidency. Pumarejo, who had gone to the area to observe army exercises, was briefly held hostage, as were several cabinet ministers who had accompanied him. After the military leadership in the capital refused to support the rebels, the leader of the failed coup - Pasto garrison commander Colonel Diogenes Gil - was arrested, and the president and his ministers were freed. Although the military continued to respect its constitutional mandate to support the government, the incident suggested that the long-standing constraints against political involvement by the military were being broken down by the deteriorating national situation. Moreover, as one Colombian scholar noted in 1955, at the time of the coup the army was beginning to be perceived by Colombians as the only national force that could \\"shield the nation from anarchy and blood-letting.\\" Even though the coup had failed, the Conservatives eventually gained control of the Colombian government in 1946, leading to a decade of civil war known as The Violence.

The PingER' Project uses a simple tool‚Äîthe ping command‚Äîto get valuable insights into performance of the Internet backbone.Stanford University High energy particle physicists began the project in 1995, because they needed to access large amounts of data at laboratories sometimes as far away as across an ocean. They needed to know how the Internet was performing, identify problems, and apply solutions. At U.S.Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, PingER let researcher Les Cottrell \\"keep tabs on how parts of the network were performing and root out any problems.\\" PingER is one of several collaborative projects having measurement infrastructures for monitoring Internet Traffic. How PingER works Using the ping command, monitoring nodes initiate transmissions to remote nodes, then measure and record the response times, or the lack of responses. Each combination of monitoring node-remote node is called a pair. PingER is easy to implement, because little special software must be installed to make measurements. Almost any networked computer will respond to a ping, and require nothing added. Monitoring nodes require only a script to issue ping commands and record results. In September 1999 there were 1977 pairs, consisting of 511 remote nodes in 54 countries. PingER uses the data to determine latency (round-trip_time), jitter (variability of round- trip_time), and loss (percentage of packets that never return). The results of the PingER Project, including source code, are made available to the public at no cost. This collection of data shows long term world-wide Internet performance trends, covering over 750 sites in over 165 countries. Researchers at the National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan, have been dealing with increasingly large amounts of PingER data by using a relational database. From a vantage point between Europe and Africa, researchers at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Italy used PingER to reveal the slow progress of improving Africa's connections to the rest of the world. Poor results for Africa Analysis of some of the PingER data reveal that: * Africa's internet was lagging 16 years behind Europe in 2009. * The World Soccer Cup in South Africa in 2010 led to new submarine cables, resulting in much shorter return times. * Angola, Zimbabia, Tanzania, Uganda have shown improvements as they converted from satellite to terrestrial links.

The team currently competes in Montenegrin Basketball League and regional ABA League. The club won the Montenegrin Cup in 2014. History KK Sutjeska was established in 1948. The first basic basketball elements given to the youth of Nik≈°iƒá were brought by Vojislav Spasojeviƒá, a basketball coach from Belgrade. Immediately after the initiative was taken, Vule Vukaloviƒá joined the team's administrative team along with the help of international referee Dragan Jak≈°iƒá‚Äîand a serious basketball team began to take form. The first competition in which KK Sutjeska participated in was in 1950, in a Montenegro-wide championship held in Cetinje, where Sutjeska beat Jedinstvo 24‚Äì20. In 1955, KK Sutjeska changed its name to KK Nik≈°iƒá. The name didn't last long‚Äîin 1957 the name was changed yet again, this time to KK Partizan Nik≈°iƒá. In 1962 the name was changed to KK Mladost. That year in the regional championship of Montenegro, six teams competed and in the end, it was actually KK Mladost who became champions‚Äîwithout a single lost match. The players that represented KK Mladost in 1962 included names such as Buriƒá, Plamenac, Gvozdenoviƒá, ≈†turanoviƒá, Krstajiƒá, Jovoviƒá, Zekoviƒá, Mijatoviƒá, Baletiƒá, Filipovski, Vu≈°uroviƒá and Nikoliƒá. In 1966 KK Mladost changed its name back to KK Sutjeska, but in 1970 the name was changed again to KK Partizan. Finally, in 1974, the team changed its name from Partizan to KK Sutjeska without taking away the Sutjeska name until 2003, when the club was known under a couple of names up until 2010. In 2010 the club was registered back to the traditional name of KK Sutjeska. On February 9, 2013, in the final match of the Montenegrin Basketball Cup, KK Sutjeska beat long-time rivals KK Buduƒánost Podgorica, 64‚Äì55. It was the first time, since Montenegro independence in 2006, that KK Buduƒánost failed to win. Vijesti: Senzacija: Ko≈°arka≈°i Sutjeske osvojili Kup!

The unit was commanded by Colonel John Wentworth, the lieutenant-governor of the colony, throughout its existence. The Royal Nova Scotia Regiment (RNSR) had an undistinguished history through most of its existence, and saw very limited action, mostly in the role of marines, but did play an important role in the defense of Nova Scotia during these wars.  Formation  Brenton Halliburton - only know portrait of someone in the regiment As tensions rose between the governments of Britain and Revolutionary France in early 1793, the British secretary of state for the colonies, Henry Dundas, wrote to Wentworth that the question of raising a provincial regiment for the defense of Nova Scotia was under consideration.Piers, Harry; \\"The Fortieth Regiment, Raised at Annapolis Royal in 1717; and Five Regiments Subsequently Raised in Nova Scotia\\"; Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, vol. XXI, Halifax, NS, 1927, p 164 In April, word arrived in Halifax, also from Dundas, that war had been declared, that all but 200 men of the British garrison were to be sent to the West Indies, that the militia was to be called out, and that Wentworth was to commence raising a provincial regiment of six companies (600 men). In spite of having no military experience, Wentworth was to be colonel of the regiment.Cuthbertson, Brian C., The Loyalist Governor, Petheric Press, Halifax, 1983, p. 62 The regiment was to serve as a Fencible unit, for local defense only. The men were to be paid and equipped like regular soldiers; they would be, in effect, a full-time home guard. In October Wentworth was directed to raise the establishment to eight companies (800 men), although the regiment would not, in the event, ever reach this strength, and further ordered that the regiment might be called on to serve in the other North American colonies, to which the men assented.Piers, pp. 165‚Äì66 Wentworth went to work on this project with enthusiasm. Winckworth Tonge, Jr., formerly adjutant of the 60th Reg't. of Foot as well as an officer of the Royal Fencible Americans and the 22nd Reg't. of Foot, was appointed as adjutant, and recruiting began on April 14. By May 28, 350 men had been enlisted. Wentworth was keen to have his regiment given the prefix \\"Royal\\" (probably based on the precedent of the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteer Regiment of the Revolutionary War), and in October Dundas granted this, but \\"without special sanction\\".Piers, p. 165 Many of the officers of the RNSR were veterans of the earlier war, or sons of veterans. For example, Samuel Bayard, named as lieutenant colonel en second, had served as a captain in the King's Orange Rangers. Major George H. Monk and Captains Jones Fawson and John Solomon had held the same ranks in the Royal Nova Scotia Volunteers, while Captain Hector Maclean had served with the 84th Highlanders.Piers, p. 167 There was a labour shortage in Nova Scotia at that time, and many Halifax merchants, led by John Butler Butler, began to protest to Wentworth that his recruiting efforts were driving up wages. This opposition soon collapsed when the merchants began to realize the lucrative contracts that the war effort was bringing; Butler even had the effrontery to apply to Dundas for a contract to supply the regiment.Cuthbertson, p. 63 Wentworth also faced difficulties from Major General Ogilvie, the commander of the regular garrison, who refused his requests for barrack space, clothing and provisions, while at the same time using Wentworth's men for three-quarters of the garrison's duties and as a source of recruits for his own 4th Reg't. of Foot.Cuthbertson, pp. 63‚Äì64 This state of affairs was finally ended in May 1794 with the arrival of Prince Edward, the Duke of Kent, to take over as commander-in-chief of the King's Forces in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Wentworth and the Prince were to form a friendship over the coming years, much to the benefit of the RNSR.Cuthbertson, pp. 70‚Äì71  Service  Monument to Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Bayard, RNSR, Middleton Park, Middleton, Nova Scotia, Canada During its existence the RNSR had its headquarters in Halifax, where it assisted in doing garrison duty, and had small parties in all of the outposts in the neighbourhood and in other parts of the province. A fairly large detachment, successively under command of Captain Maclean, Captain Aldridge, and Lieutenant Van Cortlandt, was at St. John's, Newfoundland from August 1794 until November 1795, assisting in the raising and the training of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. Other detachments were at Annapolis Royal, Windsor, and Sydney. For a short while a guard was posted at Parrsboro, to protect the north end of the ferry link across Minas Basin from Windsor to Partridge Island, the fastest route at the time from Halifax to New Brunswick.Piers, p. 170 As of July 1, 1797, the officers and men of the RNSR were distributed as follows: * At Halifax (Citadel Hill and HQ) ‚Äì 66 * At Prince Edward's quarters at Birch Cove ‚Äì 42 * At Eastern Battery ‚Äì 96 * At George's Island ‚Äì 77 * At Point Sandwich (York Battery) ‚Äì 91 * At Point Pleasant Battery ‚Äì 50 * At Northwest Arm Battery ‚Äì 23 * At Kavenaugh's (Melville) Island ‚Äì 16 * At Fort Sackville ‚Äì 34 * At Windsor (Fort Edward) ‚Äì 31 * At Annapolis Royal (Fort Anne) ‚Äì 31 * Aboard the Earl of Moira, as marines ‚Äì 36 * At Duncan's Cove (Chebucto Head) ‚Äì 7 * At Sambro Lighthouse ‚Äì 4 * On leave ‚Äì 2 * Orderlies at Regimental Hospital ‚Äì 2 * Telegraph (semaphore) men on Citadel Hill ‚Äì 2 * King's workmen at Halifax ‚Äì 5 for a total of 618, of which 527 were other ranks. There were wanting 273 to complete the establishment.Piers, p 171 A detachment of 40‚Äì50 men was always stationed the Prince's residence as a sort of guard of honour. The men posted at Sambro, Duncan's Cove, and the two men at the Citadel operated the semaphore telegraph that the Prince established to relay messages from the mouth of the harbour to his headquarters; it was the first of its kind in North America. The men at Kavenaugh's Island guarded French prisoners from La Felix, a ship captured at St. Domingo in 1794; the island was renamed in honour of Dundas (Lord Melville) after the war. A rotation of men, from 14 to 36 at a time, served as marines aboard His Majesty's armed snow Earl of Moira, a vessel of 14 guns in the pay of the province, commanded by Captain Fawson. These were probably the only men of the Regiment to see combat.Piers, p. 171 Lt. Benjamin James, Royal Nova Scotia Regiment, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia), died while trying to rescue those who died in in 1797; commemorated by Prince EdwardHistory of the county of Annapolis. p. 350 Prince Edward took almost as much pride in the regiment as Wentworth did. However, he also saw it as a source of recruits for his own 7th Reg't. of Foot (Royal Fusileers). Already in 1795 he had persuaded several officers of the RNSR to take up commissions in the 7th of Foot,Piers, p. 168 and he later decided on a plan to draft into his own regiment the best men of the RNSR in exchange for some poor-quality recruits he had received from Britain. Wentworth was horrified, in part because the Prince was known as a very severe disciplinarian. He wrote in protest to the Duke of Portland, who sent a mild reprimand to the Prince ordering him not to use the RNSR as a \\"nursery or recruiting fund,\\" because the men had enlisted as fencibles. Fear of being drafted into the Fusileers caused recruiting to dry up for several months. The Prince did throw his influence behind Wentworth's persistent efforts to have the regiment placed on the British Army's regular establishment, which would have, among other things, secured a colonel's salary for Wentworth, but these efforts came to nothing.Cuthbertson, p 77 On November 16, 1797, the frigate was wrecked during a southerly gale off Herring Cove. Lieutenant Benjamin James, Sergeants William Mullens and Sniffen Baker, and Privates Michael Brown, Cornelius Kenrick, John Bush and William Barry, all of the RNSR, were drowned attempting to rescue the crew of Tribune. It is said that the Prince, in referring to Lieutenant James, stated that \\"the flower of my regiment is gone.\\"Piers, pp. 171‚Äì72  Disbandment  The Royal Nova Scotia Regiment was disbanded at Halifax on August 24, 1802, following the Treaty of Amiens.Piers, p 172 Wentworth's biographer, Brian C. Cuthbertson, sums up the regiment's service as follows: > At a time when Nova Scotians needed patriotic symbols and reassurance in the > face of threatened attack, the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment filled a vital > need and did so most commendably. It was a fine body of men, well officered, > and one in which Wentworth and all Nova Scotians took pride.Cuthbertson, p. > 77 By the end of October, those men who wished had been given land grants in various districts of the province. Many of the officers and men would go on to do further service in the Nova Scotia Regiment of Fencible Infantry, which was raised in July 1803, after the renewal of the war with France.Piers, p. 173  Uniforms  Royal Nova Scotia Regiment uniform coatee At the time of their enlistment, the men of the RNSR mostly wore civilian clothing, essentially, whatever they were wearing when enlisted. Wentworth's difficulties with Ogilvie delayed the outfitting of the regiment with proper uniforms, although Wentworth had ordered them from England in May 1793, asking Captain Stewart of the Life Guards to advise and aid \\"in the fashion and selection of them.\\"Piers, p. 165 With the arrival of Prince Edward in 1794, the regiment was soon fully clothed.Piers, p. 166 Remarkably, a uniform coatee of a man of the RNSR still exists. This coatee is one of the earliest surviving military uniforms known to exist in Canada, and is currently held at the Army Museum at the Halifax Citadel. It confirms that the RNSR wore red coats with royal blue facings, with plain white lace for other ranks, and buttons in pairs. Given the wings on the shoulders, this would have been the coatee of a man of the grenadier or the light infantry company. This uniform would have been worn circa 1798.

The story follows the life of Omakayas and her Ojibwe community beginning in 1847 near present-day Lake Superior. The Birchbark House has received rave reviews and was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for young people's fiction. After the prologue, the novel continues through the eyes of a seven-year-old young girl, Omakayas (\\"her name means \\"little frog\\" because her first step was a hop). The circular motion of the Ojibwa culture is represented through the motions of the four seasons, Neebin (summer), Dagwaging (fall). Biboon (winter), and Zeegwun (spring). The community in each season works together to hunt, build, gather, and survive. Omakayas cares for her family because she knew that with the winter comes a smallpox epidemic. She learns about her connection to all nature, and discovers her gift of dreams. The most important thing Omakayas learns about herself is why she didn't get smallpox when most everyone in the community did. She has three siblings, Neewo (Who dies from the disease smallpox), Little Pinch(later changed to Big Pinch) and Angeline. The novel includes decorative pencil drawings, as well as a map of the Ojibwa community, and a glossary of Ojibwa language translations.Erdrich, Louise. The Birchbark House, 1999. Characters One of the central themes of Erdrich's novel is community. There are many characters in The Birchbark House. The following are the characters most of the novel is centered on. Omakayas is one of the main characters of 'The Birchbark House'. She is usually very calm and not scared easily. She is a gentle, friendly girl, but only if somebody else is friendly to her. She seems very active, but inside her heart, she is hiding her painful mind. Omakayas is very friendly and has a connection to animals. Nokomis ‚Äì The maternal grandmother of Omakayas. She lives with Omakayas and her family. She is very talented and knowledgeable about healing. She lends her knowledge of the land to Omakayas through mentoring her as well as through magnificent storytelling. Yellow Kettle ‚Äì Omakayas's mother is a strong woman who does not often display her anger, but at times her anger pours out. She is the one who keeps the family structure intact while Deydey is traveling. Deydey ‚Äì Omakayas's father is mixed race, half white and half Ojibwa. He is a trader who is gone trading during some of the novel. He has a strong personality tempered by moments of tenderness and care. Neewo - Omakayas's baby brother who Omakayas loves very much. She often pretends that Neewo is her own baby. Neewo prefers Omakayas to his other siblings. Dies in the smallpox epidemic. Angeline ‚Äì Omakayas's sister whom Omakayas loves and sees as a role model. She is known in the community for her beauty and her excellent skills in beading. Pinch ‚Äì Omakayas's younger brother whom Omakayas loves. As his sister, Omakayas sees the flaws in his character, such as his laziness. Pinch is also something of a trickster, often using his wits to get out of undesirable tasks. Omakayas does not enjoy Pinch. Fishtail - Ten Snow's husband and Deydey's friend. He also is one of the members in the community who is learning to read the tracks of the whites. In other words, he is attempting to learn the English alphabet to better aid communication and treaty negotiations with the whites. Ten Snow ‚Äì Friend of the family, Angeline's best friend, dies in the smallpox epidemic. Wife of Fishtail. Old Tallow ‚Äì Woman of great authority in the community. Omakayas understands she is one of the only children Old Tallow respects. When the family and community are suffering through the smallpox epidemic she steps up to help the community survive the rough winter. Also, she has a love for her dogs as much as her community but is able to punish the dogs when they behave poorly. Andeg ‚Äì Omakayas's pet crow that she discovers as injured and nurtures back to health. Andeg provides much of the humor throughout the novel. Through Andeg, readers have a sense of the connection Omakayas has with animals. Andeg is the Ojibwe word for crow. LaPautre Themes Culture- The Birchbark House provides a lot of information Ojibwe cultural practices, as seen in the description of Omakayas working, stretching, and cleaning a buffalo hide: She struggles with the task at first, but uses her emotions to help her continue the work and ends up with one of the best hides she has ever worked with. Through the rest of the novel this very special hide is used to make things, like moccasins. Language- Language is a second prevalent theme within this novel. The language is either conveyed through direct translation or inserted within a sentence. An example of this is the storytelling. Nokomis and Deydey are two of the characters who tell stories. According to Sabra McIntosh, ‚ÄúThey pass on family history, folklore, superstitions and customs. Nokomis tells stories in the cold of winter.

The book was published in November 2006 by Delacorte Press. The romantic fantasy novel tells the story of the main characters journey into the supernatural world of fairies after she travels across the world to find her sister's murderer. The story is set in Dublin, Ireland and involves Celtic mythology. Plot summary The novel tells the story of MacKayla Lane or \\"Mac\\", the daughter of Jack and Rainey Lane, who works as a bartender in Georgia. After learning about her sister's death Mac travels to Ireland in hopes of finding her sister's murderer when the local police close the case. Soon after arriving in Ireland, Mac is spending the evening in a local pub when she sees an inhumanly beautiful man. As she stares, her vision starts to change and she sees a man in decay with a foul odor, who she terms the Gray Man, preying on a victim. No one else notices the sight except an elderly woman who startles her by hitting her in the head and telling her not to stare because that jeopardizes them all. The old woman continues to call Mac an O'Connor, which she does not understand. Days later Mac visits a local store by the name of Barrons Books and Baubles where she meets a mysterious man by the name of Jerricho Z. Barrons who informs her of a supernatural world of the Fae and the oncoming and unknown- to-humans war between their world and humankind's. He also teaches Mac that she is a sidhe-seer, as was her sister. Mac comes to believe that her sister was killed by a former Fae, who calls himself the Lord Master, who was using her in his search for the Sinsar Dubh (pronounced shee-sa-du), a Dark Hallow authored by the Dark King of the Unseelie, and which is said to hold all the deadliest magic in its pages. Fever glossary Darkfever includes a glossary of twenty three terms that Mac keeps in her journal. The glossary is included to help readers follow along with the terminology included in the book. # #Tuatha De Danaan or Tuatha D√© ‚Äì A highly advanced race that came to Earth from another world # #Seelie ‚Äì the \\"light\\" or \\"fairer\\" court of the Tuatha D√© Danaan governed by the Seelie Queen, Aoibheal. # #Unseelie ‚Äì the \\"dark\\" court of the Tuatha D√© Danaan. According to Tuatha D√© Danaan legend, the Unseelie have been confined for hundreds of thousands of years in an inescapable prison. # #Sidhe-Seer ‚Äì a person Fae magic doesn't work on, capable of seeing past the illusions or \\"glamour\\" cast by the Fae to the true nature that lies beneath. Some can also see Tabh'rs, hidden portals # #Null ‚Äì a sidhe-seer with the power to freeze a Fae with the touch of his or her hands. The higher and more powerful the caste of Fae, the shorter the length of time it stays frozen. # #Hallow ‚Äì eight ancient relics of immense power: four light and four dark. The Light Hallows are the stone, the spear, the sword, and the cauldron. The Dark are the mirror, the box, the amulet, and the book (Sinsar Dubh or Dark Book) # #Sinsar Dubh ‚Äì a dark hallow belonging to the Tuatha D√© Danaan. Written in a language known only to the most ancient of their kind, it is said to hold the deadliest of all magic within its encrypted pages. Brought to Ireland by the Tuatha D√© during the invasions written of in the pseudo-history Leabhar Gabhala, it was stolen along with the other Dark Hallows, and rumored to have found its way into the world of Man. Allegedly authored over a million years ago by the Dark King of the Unseelie. # #The Four Stones ‚Äì translucent blue-black stones covered with raised rune-like lettering. The key to deciphering the ancient language and breaking the code of the Sinsar Dubh is hidden in these four mystical stones. An individual stone can be used to shed light on the small portion of the text, but only if the four are reassembled into one will the true text in its entirety be revealed. # #OOP (Object of Power) ‚Äì a Fae relic imbued with mystical properties. # #Glamour ‚Äì illusion cast by the Fae to camouflage their true appearance. The more powerful the Fae, the more difficult it is to penetrate its disguise. The average human sees only what the Fae wants them to see, and is subtly repelled from bumping into or brushing against it by a small perimeter of spatial distortion that is part of the Fae glamour. # #Gray Man ‚Äì Approximately 9 foot tall, monstrously ugly, leprous Unseelie that feeds by stealing beauty from human women. Can kill but prefers to leave its victim hideously disfigured and alive to suffer. # #The Many Mouthed Thing ‚Äì repulsive Unseelie with myriad leech-like mouths, dozens of eyes, and overdeveloped sex organs. # #Royal Hunters ‚Äì a mid-level caste of Unseelie. Militantly sentient, they resemble the classic depiction of the devil, with cloven hooves, horns, long satyr-like faces, leathery wings, fiery orange eyes, and tails. Seven to ten feet tall, they are capable of extraordinary speed on both hoof and wing. Their primary function is to exterminate sidhe-seers. # #Rhino Boys ‚Äì lower mid-level caste Unseelie thugs dispatch primarily as watchdogs for high-ranking Fae. # #Shades ‚Äì one of the lowest caste of the Unseelie. Sentient but barely. They cannot bear direct light and hunt only at night. They steal life in the manner the Gray Man steals beauty, draining their victims with vampiric swiftness, leaving behind a pile of clothing and a husk of dehydrated human matter. # #Dark Zone ‚Äì an area that has been taken over by the Shades. During the day it looks like your everyday abandoned, rundown neighborhood. Once night falls, it's a death trap. # #Pri-Ya ‚Äì a human addicted to Fae sex. # #Sifting ‚Äì Fae method of transportation. Occurs at the speed of thought. # #Sifting Silvers ‚Äì an elaborate maze of mirrors once used as the primary method of Fae travel between realms, until Cruce cast the forbidden curse into the silvered corridors. Now no Fae dares enter the Silvers. # #Spear of Luisne ‚Äì a.k.a. Spear of Luin, Holy Lance, Spear of Longuins, Spear of Destiny, and the Flaming Spear. The spear used to pierce Jesus Christ's right side at his crucifixion. Not of human origin; it is a Tuatha D√© Danaan Light Hallow, and one of the few items capable of killing a Fae-regardless of rank or power. # #Tabh'rs ‚Äì Fae doorways or portals between realms, often hidden in everyday human objects. # #Cuff of Cruce ‚Äì A gold arm cuff; It was made long ago for one of his prized human concubines. It permits a shield of sorts against many Unseelie. # #The Compact ‚Äì The treaty governing cohabitation of the races (Fae and Man). The terms of the Compact are secret from all mortals but the MacKeltar, a highland clan of ancient bloodline descended form the Druids, and sole keepers of Man's end of the treaty.

It was originally created in 1989 by Jeff Knurek although the equipment he created for the game became outdated and lost popularity in 1995. The sport experienced a revival in 2018 when Spikeball Inc. began promoting it. The company manufactures equipment for the sport, and so \\"spikeball\\" became a common name for the sport. There are multiple ways to play roundnet. Most games consist of four players, but there are also two- and six-player variants. Differences include where the players line up and infraction penalties, among others. The materials used in roundnet include a small trampoline-like object with string netting, a small bouncing ball with a 12-inch circumference, and four players. Players initially line up directly across from one another, forming an even diamond around the net at the start of a point. In all versions, the game starts with a serve from one team to another, continues as long as the ball is being hit by players back to the net, and ends when an infraction occurs between either the players or the ball. The game is constantly evolving, with new defensive strategies, serving stances, and playstyles being developed every season. The first ever Roundnet World Championship is scheduled for September 2020 in Belgium. Roundnet basics Roundnet features elements from many other sports such as volleyball and four square. The game is played between two teams of two people. Players are positioned at 4 points around the net, with partners located at neighboring positions. One player serves the ball across the net to the opposing team member. The opposing team then has 3 hits to return the ball to the net. After the serve, there are no boundaries of play. Participants are free to run, set, and spike the ball from anywhere around the net. Play continues until a team fails to return the ball or the ball hits a rim piece, at which point the point ends, and the other team receives 1 point. Rules Source:https://tournaments.spikeball.com/pages/official-rules-1 alt=  Setup  Materials needed for roundnet include a trampoline-like net, and a small ball with a 12-inch circumference. Players line up in a square around the net with their partner to one side, and a member of the opposing team on the other. Each partner is ninety degrees away from the next player. Before the point starts, players will always be across the net from an opponent and next to their teammate. Each point begins with a serve, usually done by the team who won the previous point. To determine who serves first in the match, teams will play a game of rock paper scissors with the winner of the rock paper scissors game receiving the option to serve first or receive first. During the serve, all players who are not receiving the serve have to line up in their designated positions outside of 6 feet from their section of the rim. The returner can stand wherever they want prior to the serve. Once the ball is served, all players on both teams can move wherever they may like. After the ball is served, the possession is assumed by the returning team. Once the ball is hit and returned by the non-serving team and hits the net, the possession is flipped. This continues throughout the point, as possession changes whenever the ball hits the net. During each possession, teams have three hits but do not have to use all of their hits. To account for harsh sunlight, wind, or any other condition outside of the game; players will rotate serving positions ninety degrees every five points. Only a maximum of 3 touches are permitted.  Serving  The first serve starts the game, and the setup is dictated by the first receiver. The server then stands directly across from the receiver, and only the designated receiver may receive the serve. To serve, the server must throw the ball at least 4 inches away from the release point to begin the serve. The ball is not allowed to be interfered with during the serve. For each point, the server is allowed two serves to complete a legal serve. If they catch, swing at and miss, or drop the tossed ball, it results in a service fault. Servers must be behind the six-foot line away from the net to be eligible for the play. The server cannot lean over the line in order to get closer to the net, and their feet and entire body must be behind the line until the ball is contacted. The server is allowed to take a pivot step, but cannot move further than a pivot. The server can hit the ball at any speed and direction including drop shots. For the serve to be eligible, the ball must not go any higher than the receiver's raised hand. If the ball does this, the receivers must call fault before a second touch occurs or the ball hits the ground. The serving team will have one more try to serve it correctly, or they lose the point. When serving, if the ball hits what is known as a \\"pocket\\" (the area of the net that is right next to the rim) then the receiving team can call a fault and the server can attempt another serve. If a fault is not called, then the play continues. If two faults occur back to back, the receiving team is awarded the point and possession switches sides. If the serving team wins the point, the server must switch places with their teammate to serve to the other receiver. If the receiving team wins the point, they get to serve the next point.  Contacting the ball  Rules and regulations exist when the ball is in play. When a team has possession, they must alternate touches, so no double hits happen. The ball must be hit; it cannot be lifted, caught or thrown. Players must use one hand to hit the ball; two-hand hits result in an infraction and loss of point. Any part of the body may be used to hit the ball. However, if the ball hits any part of the body (even if not the hands), then it may not be hit a second time. In other words, a player cannot hit the ball twice in a row no matter what part of the body the ball touches, including if the ball touches elsewhere than the hands. If the ball hits the ground or the rim at any point during the rally, the play ends and a point is given to the other team. If the teams could not determine whether the ball hit the rim or a pocket, the play is replayed. When the ball hits the net, it must clear the rim for the play to be continued. If the ball hits the net again, a double bounce is called and point given to the assuming receiving team. If during a rally the ball hits the pocket, the rally continues. Pockets are only a fault during serves. If the ball makes contact with the net and then proceeds to roll up into the rim, this is known as a \\"roll-up\\". If this occurs during a serve, the receiving team may call a fault and the serve is tried again. If a roll-up occurs during a rally, it is treated as a pocket, and the rally continues. Infractions exist even if a team does not have assumed possession, these are called hinders. These include if a defensive player gets in the way of the team going for the ball. It is required that defensive players make an effort to get out of the way to avoid interference. If a player gets in the way of the play, the opposing team must call \\"hinder\\". They will then be able to replay the point. The offensive team must have a legitimate reason to call \\"hinder\\". If the defensive player makes an attempt to play at the ball if they do not have possession, they lose the point. If a player hits a shot that hits off the net and hits either themselves or their teammate, they lose the point. If a player makes contact with the set, it results in the loss of the point. Even if the player hit a \\"kill shot\\", they will lose the point if they touch the set before the ball makes contact with the ground.  Scoring  An amateur player shows off the eponymous \\"spike\\" of Spikeball Scoring in roundnet is dictated by \\"rally scoring\\", meaning that a team may earn a point whether they are serving or not. Games are usually played to 21 points, but the tournament organizer can change that at his/her discretion. As is common with similar games such as ping-pong, tennis, and volleyball, teams can only win by two points. This can lead to deuces and point-advantages until a team wins by 2 points. Points can be scored in these ways: * When the ball doesn't hit the net within three hits during a possession * The ball hits the ground * The ball hits the rim. (This includes during serves) * The ball does not bounce off the net on a single bounce, also known as a double hit. The ball must clear the rim of the net completely. * There are two illegal serves in a row. * The player hits themselves or their teammate with the ball after it makes contact with the net  Skills  Many competitive teams and players master these 4 fundamental skills: serve, pass/dig/set, attack (spike), and the body block. These skills are standard practice for high-level advanced, premier, or pro division players.  Serve  The server stands behind the 6 foot serving line, in attempt to hit the ball onto the net. The servers main goal is to hit a clean serve that will result in a bad touch or a possible \\"ace\\". A serve is called an \\"ace\\" when the server hits the ball onto the net, bounces off clean, and the ball goes untouched by the receiver and hits the ground, or the ball hits the ground before the receiver can touch it, or the receiver has a bad touch and the ball goes off in a different direction, resulting in the ball hitting the ground. In present-day roundnet, several types of serves are implemented: * Basic serve: Used by most beginners. When a player hits the ball with a flat hand giving the ball little to no spin. The basic serve is rarely used in high-level games and tournaments, because of how easy the serve is to receive. Can be performed in any serving stance * Topspin/Jam/Backdoor serve: The most commonly used serve in the sport of roundnet. It's when the player tosses the ball and hits the ball with top spin, which makes the ball go shooting forward at the receiver. When hit hard this serve can be extremely difficult to receive. This serve can be performed in multiple serving stances. * Drop serve: Another very commonly used serve in the sport of roundnet. When the player tosses the ball and hits the ball with a bit of back spin, which results in the ball dropping in-front of the receiver. When the serve is placed properly it can be extremely difficult to defend if the opposing player is further back while receiving the hard driven serves. This serve can be performed in multiple serving stances. * Cut serve: Used by advanced-level players, the server tosses the ball and hits the ball with side spin and top spin, making the ball bounce off the net wider than expected by the receiver. When this serve is placed on the net with tons of power and spin it can be extremely hard for the receiver to get a touch. This serve can be used in most stances, may be more difficult for certain stances.  Pass/dig/set  A pass or a dig is used to properly receive the opponents serve or any type of hit. To properly handle the serve or hit, the player not only has to prevent it from hitting the ground, but also wants to give their partner a good pass to allow them to create a good set. There are two different techniques used to pass the ball, they can be used in different circumstances: * Under hand pass: When the player makes a platform with their hand for the ball to bounce off the palm of their hand. Most commonly used for setting for a partner. * Over head pass: Essentially the same contact with the under hand pass, but pushing the ball over head. Most commonly used when receiving the serve and hard driven hits, long distance setting, or when the ball is traveling over head.  Attack (spiking)  A hit/flick/chip/drop is used when a player is attacking the ball; its an attempt to give their opponent a hard hit to defend so they are unable to get the ball back onto the net. Players usually use a combination of wrist snap, arm swing and rotation to deliver certain types of attacks. The main goal of the hitter is to get a \\"kill\\". A \\"kill\\" is a term used when ball is hit and bounces off the net, and the opposing team could not dig the ball, resulting in a point. In present-day roundnet there are many different ways to attack the ball: * Hit(spike): A hard driven hit usually performed with topspin. * Flick: A very low trajectory shot to place the ball where the defender is not. This is a placement shot. * Chip: A high and far trajectory shot to place the ball overhead of the defender, being unreachable then landing very far away from the net. * Drop: A low trajectory shot placed in front of the defender. This attack is used with minimal amounts of force.  Body block  A body block is a common tactic for defence. Where the player defending a hard driven shot, gets hit with ball, passing the ball up to his partner for a set. Body blocks can also be used to block the ball back onto the net, this is referred to a \\"God-(hand, body, knee, or block etc)\\". A \\"God-block\\" is when a player uses any part of their body, for example their hand, to deflect the ball back onto the net in one touch usually resulting in a \\"kill\\", in this case it would be called a \\"God-hand\\".

K-25 runs from Oklahoma State Highway 136 (SH-136) at the Oklahoma State Line to Nebraska Highway 25 (N-25) at the Nebraska border, running through Leoti, Colby, and Atwood plus many more towns along the way. K-25 was first designated as a state highway in 1927 and at that time began at K-45 west of Moscow, and ran north to the Nebraska border and continued as N-25. In 1959, the highway was extended south from, US-56 and K-51 to the Oklahoma border. Route description K-25 as it passes through Lakin K-25 enters Kansas from Oklahoma, acting as a continuation of SH-136. K-25 continues relatively due north through flat land until it meets U.S. Route 56 (US-56) and K-51. K-25 turns northeast on the two routes, which K-25 is concurrent with until Hugoton, when K-25 and K-51 split off of US-51. North of town, K-25 splits off of K-51, and K-25 continues in the same fashion as it did, passing through Ulysses, where US-160 is intersected, Lakin, where K-25 junctions US-50 and US-400 at the same time, and Leoti, where K-96 is intersected. K-25 where it intersects US-50 and US-400 After leaving Leoti, K-25 continues due north for about 20 miles, until the route turns east for about 8 miles, until turning back north, immediately passing through Russell Springs. North of Russell Springs, US-40 is intersected, sharing an overlap for about ten miles. After turning onto US-40, the road starts to become hillier. K-25 separates just west of Baker. From there, it goes north to Colby, traveling through lightly rolling hills. Just south of Colby, I-70 is junctioned, with a good number of services near the interchange. K-25 then becomes a 4 lane divided highway until it enters Colby, where it changes back into a surface street. Within the Colby city limits, US-24 is intersected. K-25 continues out of Colby, alternating between flat and rolling land. In Atwood, US-36 is intersected. K-25 leaves Atwood traveling through rolling hills at first, but flattens out as it continues north. K-25 exits Kansas into Nebraska where N-25 continues toward Trenton, Nebraska. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 230 vehicles south of Russell Springs, 2400 vehicles south of Lakin, to between 2500 and 5000 vehicles in Ulysses. K-25 is not included in the National Highway System, a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-25 does connect to the National Highway System at its junction with US-50 and US-400 in Lakin, and at I-70 in Colby. History Establishment and extensions K-25 southbound at K-96 K-25 was first designated as a state highway in 1927. At that time it began at K-45 west of Moscow, and ran north to K-46 in New Ulysses. It then continued to Leoti, where it intersected K-96. From here it continued northward through Russell Springs to US-40S east of Winona. The two routes then overlapped to Oakley, where it left US-40S and joined K-22 northward. The two routes continued northward to US-40N, where K-25 left the overlap and joined US-40N westbound. The two routes then continued west to Colby, where K-25 left the overlap amd headed north. It soon crossed K-2 the crossed into Nebraska and continued as N-25. In a July 22, 1959 resolution, the section of highway had been brought up to state highway standards from the Oklahoma border to US-56 and K-51, and it became a southward extension of K-25. Realignments In a June 6, 1936 resolution, K-25 was slightly to eliminate two sharp curves, north of Lakin along the Kearny-Wichita county line. Between February 1937 and January 1938, US-270 was extended into Kansas, and overlapped K-25 from the Hugoton to Ulysses. Then in a May 18, 1981 resolution, the US-270 designation was removed.http://www.ksdot.org/Assets/wwwksdotorg/bureaus/burTransPlan/maps/HistoricStateMaps/1981-82Mapside.pdf In a September 12, 1938 resolution, a section of K-25 was realigned southwest of Lakin to eliminate four sharp curves. In a November 12, 1947 resolution, K-25 was realigned in and east of Leoti. In a March 30, 1950 resolution, K-25 and US-270 was realigned slightly east where it crosses the South Fork Cimarron River, just north of the Grant-Stevens county line. In a February 13, 1952 resolution, it was slightly realigned, southwest of Russell Springs. Also a new bridge was built across the Smoky Hill River. In two separate August 11, 1954 resolutions, Logan and Thomas counties had finished bringing the section of roadway, from west of Monument north to Colby, up to state highway standards. The section then became a realignment of K-25. In a March 9, 1955 resolution, the highway was realigned south of Atwood to eliminate four sharp curves.

A set of m positive rational numbers with the similar property that the product of any two is one less than a rational square is known as a rational diophantine m-tuple.  Diophantine m-tuples  The first diophantine quadruple was found by Fermat: \\\\\\\\{1,3, 8, 120\\\\\\\\}. It was proved in 1969 by Baker and Davenport that a fifth positive integer cannot be added to this set. However, Euler was able to extend this set by adding the rational number \\\\frac{777480}{8288641}. The question of existence of (integer) diophantine quintuples was one of the oldest outstanding unsolved problems in Number Theory. In 2004 Andrej Dujella showed that at most a finite number of diophantine quintuples exist. In 2016 it was shown that no such quintuples exist by He, Togb√© and Ziegler. As Euler proved, every Diophantine pair can be extended to a Diophantine quadruple. The same is true for every Diophantine triple. In both of these types of extension, as for Fermat's quadruple, it is possible to add a fifth rational number rather than an integer.  The rational case  Diophantus himself found the rational diophantine quadruple \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac1{16}, \\\\frac{33}{16}, \\\\frac{17}4, \\\\frac{105}{16}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. More recently, Philip Gibbs found sets of six positive rationals with the property. It is not known whether any larger rational diophantine m-tuples exist or even if there is an upper bound, but it is known that no infinite set of rationals with the property exists.

Gilmore, 216 F.3d 401 (4th Cir. 2000), is a case decided before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which concerned the matter of professors challenging constitutionality of Virginia law restricting access to sexually explicit material on work computers. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) joined the professors in the case against the state of Virginia. A three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit overturned an earlier ruling by the District Court, and upheld the Virginia law. The ACLU then requested an en banc hearing of the entire Fourth Circuit, which determined that university instructors do not have a right guaranteed by the United States Constitution to view sexually explicit material on facility computers. The ACLU then appealed this decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, and the ruling by the Fourth Circuit remained in effect. Background Six university instructors in Virginia sued contesting a state regulation which prohibited them as state employees from viewing sexually explicit material on work computers. The six professors' research included an academic study of Internet pornography. Professor Melvin Urofsky of Virginia Commonwealth University was the lead plaintiff. They asserted that this prohibition violated their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The legislation challenged was originally passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1996, and then later amended in 1999. The six college instructors argued that the legislation resulted in chilled speech leading to a limited role and decreased capacity for them to teach and perform academic research. The university professors were joined in their case against the state by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The academic specialties of the professors included poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, and the subject of human sexuality. One of the plaintiffs was a professor who focused her research in queer studies, women's studies, and gender studies. She told The Virginian-Pilot that she was not sure whether she was able to study the topic of human sexuality online due to the Virginia law. Another professor in the case said he chose not to give his class an assignment studying indecency law on the Internet due to his concern he could not confirm their research online. Case history District Court The representative for the Virginia Attorney General was quoted in The Virginian-Pilot: \\"This case is not about censorship or regulating the Internet. The issue is about appropriate use of taxpayer funds. The taxpayers of Virginia should not be forced to pay for the use of state computers‚Äîon state time‚Äîby state employees for downloading pornography off the Internet.\\" In 1998, a ruling by the District Court in the case invalidated the Virginia law. Fourth Circuit =Panel ruling= In February 1999 a judgment by a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit overturned the District Court ruling, and upheld the law. The ACLU then requested an en banc hearing before the entire Fourth Circuit. The executive director of the ACLU of Virginia commented on the Fourth Circuit's decision, \\"In many ways this ushers in a new era in which college professors will have to seek permission for what they do.\\" =En Banc hearing= On October 25, 1999, en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reheard the case before the court. =Decision= The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued their decision from the full circuit panel of judges on June 23, 2000. The Fourth Circuit determined that university instructors do not have a right guaranteed by the United States Constitution to view sexually explicit on facility computers. In its ruling, the court upheld Virginia legislation which disallowed state workers from viewing such material on state computers unless it was part of a study project previously sanctioned. The court decided that because these employees were workers for the state, their study was not a form of protected speech. The Fourth Circuit ruled that the legal challenge, \\"amounts to a claim that academic freedom of professors is not only a professional norm, but also a constitutional right. We disagree.\\" Supreme Court In July 2000, the Virginia chapter of the ACLU decided to appeal the decision of the full Fourth Circuit to the Supreme Court of the United States. The executive director of the ACLU of Virginia stated to The Virginian-Pilot, \\"This decision has so thoroughly eviscerated the free-speech rights of public employees that we believe the U.S. Supreme Court will be willing to review this case and reverse the decision. Worst of all is that the 4th Circuit has essentially ruled there is no such thing as academic freedom. The Supreme Court may not go along with that.\\" The Supreme Court refused to hear the case further, and the thus the decision of the Fourth Circuit remained in effect. Impact After the District Court struck down the Virginia law but before the case was heard by the first three-judge panel in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Virginia House of Delegates moved to pass legislation which would effectively repeal the law. The proposed bill, HB2343, gained support from the Virginia House of Delegates' Committee on Science and Technology on February 5, 1999. HB2343 was intended to replace the prior Virginia law, and instead provide more lenient rules that necessitated state government groups form appropriate guidelines including harsh sanctions for downloading or watching sexually explicit material in the workplace. The bill moved to the entire Virginia House of Delegates in February 1999. After realizing the judicial system had not completed analyzing the law, the Virginia General Assembly ceased deliberation over whether to repeal the original bill. Analysis Writing in the Journal of Personnel Evaluation in Education, authors Kevin Kinser and Richard Fossey commented: \\"With the U.S. Supreme Court having declined review of the Fourth Circuit's opinion, the ruling in Urofsky diminishes the significance of academic freedom as a constraint on personnel decisions by academic administrators whose responsibility include the supervision of professors.\\" See also *Academic freedom * Freedom of speech * Network for Education and Academic Rights * Politicization of science * Scholars at Risk * Scientific freedom * Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship * Speech code References Further reading * External links *Urofsky v.

Wolf was born in Dresden, the seventh and youngest child of an attorney of family law. After serving in the military, he studied philosophy, art history and literature, and completed a doctorate in philosophy. In 1927, he joined the foreign ministry and was posted to Rome at the time Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. He was first invited to join the Nazi Party that year, but he declined and did not join until 1 March 1939, after it became clear that his diplomatic work would be impossible otherwise. Between 1940 and 1944, Wolf was the German consul in Florence. After the German occupation of Italy in 1943, he worked to save many Jews from the Holocaust, including the famous art historian Bernard Berenson, who testified to that effect in 1946. In his efforts, he was supported by Rudolf Rahn, the deputy ambassador at Rome. Wolf, along with Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich, director of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz, also saved many artworks from being spirited off to Germany. He also prevented the Ponte Vecchio from being destroyed. In 1955, Wolf was made an honorary citizen of Florence. Ten years after his retirement, he died in Munich. In 2007, a marble plaque in his honour was unveiled on the Ponte Vecchio by the acting mayor of Dresden. Further reading *Tutaev, David. Der Konsul von Florenz: Die Rettung einer Stadt.

Better known as The Weapon, Robinson is notable for his intense training methods which were criticised following a spate of soft- tissue injuries at Essendon in the second half of the 2012 AFL season. Prior to his work as a professional fitness coach, Robinson showed a passion for rodeo. Acting the position of both a steer wrestler and a rodeo clown, Robinson proved a versatile competitor and went all the way to the World Steer Wrestling Association titles in 1997. He also spent several years training other rodeo athletes, before later branching out into additional sports. Before his association with a long string of clubs, Robinson worked at the NSW Institute of Sport. His subsequent transition into the NRL was sparked by his brother Trent Robinson, who had been employed in a variety of coaching roles at several clubs. Beginning in 2005, Robinson worked with the Manly Sea Eagles. Spending two years at the club, Robinson implemented a far more scientific approach to training than was previously in place. Robinson‚Äôs contribution to the club‚Äôs improved performance did not go unnoticed, and in 2006 AFL clubs also began to express interest in his services. This soon culminated in the Geelong Football Club hiring him for the 2007 season. Robinson left Geelong to join the new Gold Coast Football Club in their inaugural season. After a year there, he moved back to Melbourne and began working for the Essendon Football Club. There he was reunited with Mark Thompson, who was head coach at Geelong during Robinson's time. In February 2013, Essendon announced that they had reported themselves to Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) to investigate the possible use of banned substances. Robinson, as the club's fitness boss, was stood down from his position pending the results of the enquiry. His link to Stephen Dank, a controversial sports scientist who was introduced to Essendon by Robinson, was investigated by the AFL. Hinting at further revelations, former ASADA head Richard Ings said \\"this is not a black day in Australian sport, this is the blackest day.\\" Following the uproar, a chorus of accredited individuals leap to the defence of the newly embattled fitness coach. Central among these was three-time Geelong premiership player and Norm Smith medalist Paul Chapman. Chapman, shocked at the claims involving Robinson, was highly supportive of the man to whom he attributed much of his own personal success. Speaking highly of his former mentor, Chapman said Robinson was a true \\"family man\\" and suggested he had been shamed \\"simply by association\\". Denouncing the press gallery, Chapman maintained that a trial by media had left Robinson guilty until proven innocent. Geelong captain Joel Selwood expressed similar admiration for the man, describing Robinson as a \\"legend of a bloke\\", while football chief Neil Balme and current Gold Coast captain Gary Ablett also lent their support. Former Essendon vice-captain Mark McVeigh was similarly forthright in his praise, claiming Robinson's knowledge of the club's fitness program was \\"squeaky clean\\". \\"I can honestly tell you that everything I took I knew 100 per cent that it was within the WADA and AFL doping regulations,\\" McVeigh continued, affirming his belief that Robinson had done nothing wrong. Following his sacking Robinson began a legal campaign against the club, on the grounds of unfair dismissal. On Thursday 2 October, Essendon reached a $1 million settlement with Robinson to end his unfair dismissal claim. A trial had previously been set for 10 November and several high profile figures, such as Andrew Demetriou and Gillon McLachlan, were expected to testify. In court documents Robinson claimed that an Essendon public relations strategy had been formulated to portray himself and Stephen Dank as \\"rogue operators\\" during their tenure.

The Mission Hill School is a member of the Coalition of Essential Schools. The school has a diverse student body of approximately 220 students, with democratic decision-making at the school and classroom levels, a curricular focus on five democratic \\"Habits of Mind\\", school-wide thematic units, a strong emphasis on the arts, and graduation from the school upon creating and defending portfolios of student work for a panel of evaluators. Students are admitted to the school based on a lottery, within the choice system of the Boston Public Schools (with consideration given to whether families live within the \\"walk zone\\" and whether a sibling already attends the school, among other factors). Graduates have been found to achieve academic success in high school and college at high rates. In 2002, Meier's book In Schools We Trust included substantial attention to the Mission Hill School.

He was a regular in the side that year, playing at either prop or second row. The next year he made just 4 appearances, all losses. With the threat of Wests being kicked out of the competition, Freeman spent the 1985 season playing with Cooma in the country Group 16 league. Returning to Wests, he was often the starting prop in 1986, and again in 1987 when he made 22 appearances for the season. In 1986 he captained the Magpies when they had a surprise 30-20 victory over Manly Freeman missed the first 4 games of the 1988 season due to a suspension imposed after a head-high tackle in a pre-season National- Panasonic Cup match. Freeman denied the charge, saying, \\"He went down fairly easily and when I slung him to the ground his head hit hard. I thought my tackle was hard but it was fair.\\" On-ground officials disagreed, saying the opposing player had been unconscious before he hit the ground. Freeman received a reduced sentence because of his previously clean record. Freeman spent two more years with Wests, before playing for Barrow in the 1989/90 English season. After retiring, Freeman spent a season coaching Junee. Freeman was honoured as a bench player in the Western Suburbs Magpies' Team of the Eighties.

The site is located in Gunnison, Colorado on a low ridge that extends west from Tenderfoot Mountain overlooking the joining of the Gunnison and Tomichi River. First recorded in 1986 by the Complete Archaeological Service Associates (CASA) of Cortez, Colorado site 5GN1835 was originally described as a small lithic scatter with little scientific significance.Stiger, M. (2001). Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology of the Colorado High Country. Boulder, Colorado: University Press of Colorado.. During the spring of 1991 Western State Colorado University was requested to survey on the site by the City of Gunnison who wanted to place a tree disposal area on the seventy-four acre parcel of land. Mark Stiger and two undergraduate students surveyed the land and found several areas of concentrated archeological material along with a proper area without archeological material for the tree dump. After the initial survey results a proposal for research was requested by the city of Gunnison. Funding for the site came from several different sources including: Colorado Historical Society (Historic Fund Projects), The City of Gunnison (Challenge Grant Program), the Western State Colorado University Foundation, Western State Colorado University, and private donors. Fieldwork began in 1991 and lasted through 1998 and was successful in recovering significant archaeological information and presenting it to the public. The site was excavated with a Total Mapping Station (TMS). The weather of the Gunnison basin restricted the fieldwork to June, July, and August. Standard excavation methods were employed using archeological tools on 1x1 meter squares. The soil was then carried to a 1/8-inch screen mesh and sifted. The seven-year excavation was conducted in a 428 square meter block that contains ninety features and yielded 24,621 artifacts. The first surface collection yielded 24,149 flake stone artifacts, the second surface collection yielded 4,420 flaked-stone artifacts, and the third collection yielded 5,215 artifacts. The stone tools found were classified into: bi-faces, uni-faces, hafted bi-faces, cores, hammer stones, choppers, used edges, and ground stone artifacts (manos, metates and abraders).  Site  The site includes over 85 features with lined and unlined rock fire pits and storage pits, post holes, fire cracked rock features, and a structure. Archaic structures have been found that date to the earliest Archaic and maybe to late Paleoindian periods. These earliest structures are round or oval, shallow, basin-shaped features about in diameter. Some have postholes. The best-preserved structures have interior hearths, bell-shaped storage features, and other pits in the floors. Residential houses were identified by floor features (fire pit, bell shaped storage pit and post holes) the pattern of outside features (hearth, storage pits and trash dump) the presence of certain artifacts (ground stone, bone needle, and stone knives) and the similarity to several other archaic features. A wide range of structure types is represented in this time period. A cribbed-log structure covered with brush and daub has been excavated and reported. Daub structures are reported, as well as basin-shaped structures. Test excavations in the trash deposit of one village site showed almost two meters' accumulation of charcoal, ash, bone, and stone tool debris. This evidence shows that these structures were occupied throughout the winter season. The post-Pleistocene soil deposits were shallow reaching the hard calcareous soil within or less. Surrounding pits were dug to check for deposits and only a few sites with additional cultural material were found in 1994. Radiocarbon samples were taken from 4 features on the edge of the site. Over 24,621 lithic artifacts mainly consisting of quartzites, cherts, and obsidian were recovered during excavation with analysis that designed to answer several questions about prehistoric technology. This type of analysis attempts to treat each artifact is recorded as a group of measurements. Variables that were measured to inform lithic technology included raw material, platform type, cortex on dorsal surface, condition, form and termination. All contents of features at Tenderfoot underwent flotation analysis using a standard water/aerator process. This process was interrupted by an unknown mineral within Gunnison soil that prevented some of the organic material from floating to the surface for analysis. After conducting several experiments the lead archaeologists on site found that floating a soil sample twice (double flotation) with complete drying between flotation‚Äôs solved the problem. Double flotation coupled with heavy fraction processing became the standard procedure at the site and increased the recovery of organic material. During the digs in 1991 several hundred visitors along with the Gunnison county public schools toured the site. From 1991-1999 Western State College has given tours, and gave presentations to K-12 students, civic groups and public forums.

The dialect is spoken in the Central Hu√°nuco region of Per√∫, primarily in the Hu√°nuco Province districts of Hu√°nuco, Churubamba, Santa Mar√≠a del Valle, San Francisco de Cayr√°n, and Conchamarca.Weber, D. J. (1989). A Grammar of Huallaga (Hu√°nuco) Quechua. Berkeley: University of California Press  Speakers' influences  As of 1993, Huallaga Quechua was spoken monolingually by 66% of the population of its native speakers, the remainder of whom are bilingual primarily in Spanish. While communication in Quechua still maintains its cultural value within communities, Spanish is preferred for inter-community use. Because of the widespread bilingualism, a portion of Spanish vocabulary (mostly consisting of terms for recently developed technology) has become incorporated in Huallaga Quechua, and conversely the local Spanish has also loaned words from the Quechua dialect. According to David Weber, the UCLA linguist who published the 1989 grammar of Huallaga Quechua, some now-common phones in Huallaga Quechua are only present in Spanish loanwords and sound-symbolic words, but the language seems to have had no structural influence from Spanish beyond phones and vocabulary.  Orthography  Having had no written language until after the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire, Quechua languages throughout South America now use characters from the Latin alphabet. The system was standardized by the Peruvian government in the 1970s and 1980s, and David Weber chooses to adhere to the Peruvian Ministry of Education's standards (4023-75) in his grammar. Recent publications in Huallaga Quechua, however, conform to a new standard (0151-84). The Latin symbols for Huallaga Quechua consonants are as follows (cross-reference with phonemic consonants):  Orthographic symbols  { \\"IPA wikitable\\" - ! colspan=2 ! Bilabial ! Alveolar ! Postalveolar ! Retroflex ! Palatal ! Velar ! Uvular ! Glottal !

Vowels are , corresponding to their IPA values. The orthography for a long vowel in the Ministry (4023-75) standard is by doubling the vowel: ‚Üí , and the newer (0151-84) regulations apply a diaeresis ‚Üí .  Phonology   Phonemic Consonants  { \\"IPA wikitable\\" - ! colspan=2 ! Bilabial ! Alveolar ! Postalveolar ! Retroflex ! Palatal ! Velar ! Uvular ! Glottal !

Huallaga Quechua notably lacks the ejectives and contrastive aspiration of stops present in other Quechua dialects, such as the Cuzco dialect. The presence of voiced stops primarily in loanwords seems to be common across dialects.  Vowels  { \\"IPA wikitable\\" - ! colspan=2 ! Front ! Central ! Back - align=center ! colspan=2 High i u - align=center ! colspan=2 Mid (e) (o) - align=center ! colspan=2 Low a } Both mid vowels in Huallaga Quechua are also Spanish loans. The original three-vowel inventory, contrasting only height and backness, is typical across Quechua dialects. = Length = Length is contrasted phonemically in Huallaga Quechua. Though phonetically length is a vocalic feature, the phonological system treats vowel length as a consonant. This becomes especially important in the limitations on syllable structure. See segmentation rules. Fine semantic differences may be expressed by vowel length: */kawa-ra-:-tÕ° Éu/ ‚Üí [kawara:tÕ° Éu] 'I did not live' :live-PST-1-NEG */kawa-:-raq-tÕ° Éu/ ‚Üí [kawa:ra:tÕ° Éu] 'I still don't live' :live-1-yet-NEG In Spanish loanwords, Huallaga Quechua often renders accented syllable stress as vowel length, even if the stress does not fall on the penult.  Segmentation  The maximal syllable structure of Huallaga Quechua is CVC, with V, VC, and CV all being permissible as well. CCC, CC#, #CC, and VV are impermissible. * [huk] 'one' * [tan.ta] 'bread' * [pa.qas.raq] 'yet night' * [ka:. êu] 'truck' When segmenting a word in Huallaga Quechua for syllables, the process is systematic and straightforward. Begin from the end of the word, working backwards - all vowels become syllable nuclei. If the word ends in a consonant, that consonant is the coda to the word's final syllable. Any single consonant preceding a vowel is the onset to that syllable. Any two consonants in a row will be spanning a syllable boundary. It is important to keep in mind that consonants in this case include length; a CV: syllable is not an open syllable, but a bimoraic closed syllable. = -ni- Insertion = The addition of morphological affixation complicates the derivation of felicitous syllables. Certain suffixes begin with consonant clusters or consist of single consonants, including vocalic length. The only environment in which these suffixes would not produce impermissible syllables is following a non-lengthened vowel at the end of a root. The category of possessive suffixes in particular undergoes a syllable insertion process in order to prevent the affixation of these suffixes to bimoraic roots from producing illegal structures. The meaningless syllable -ni- is inserted at the morpheme boundary where a bimoraic-final root meets a possessive suffix with a consonant that appears before a syllable boundary. *Infelicitous syllables without -ni- insertion :/hatun- + -:/ ‚Üí *[hatun:] 'my big one' :/maqa-ma-q- + -n.tÕ° Éi:/ ‚Üí *[maqamaqntÕ° Éi:] 'the one who hit us' :/…≤atin- + -j.naq/ ‚Üí *[…≤atinjnaq] 'not having a liver' :/papa:- + -n/ ‚Üí *[papa:n] 'his father' *Felicitous syllables with -ni- insertion :/hatun- + -:/ ‚Üí [ha.tun.ni:] 'my big one' :/maqa-ma-q- + -n.tÕ° Éi:/ ‚Üí [ma.qa.maq.nin.tÕ° Éi:] 'the one who hit us' :/…≤atin- + -j.naq/ ‚Üí […≤a.tin.nij.naq] 'not having a liver' :/papa:- + -n/ ‚Üí [pa.pa:.nin] 'his father' An interesting outlier in this process is the possessive suffix [-joq], whose affixation provokes -ni insertion optionally. This evidence speaks to the generalization of the morpho-phonological -ni- insertion rule across the entire morphological category of possessive suffixes rather than truly being a phonologically-determined rule. :/atoq- + -joq/ ‚Üí [a.toq.ni.joq] :/atoq- + -joq/ ‚Üí [a.toq.joq] Two processes, related diachronically, may be hypothesized to explain the development of -ni- insertion and its potential eventual generalization: ::Ia. /'NounRoot'- + -'PossessiveSuffix'/ ‚Üí ['NounRoot-PossessiveSuffix'] ::IIa. √∏ ‚Üí [-ni-] / {NounRoot [bimoraic œÉ]}- ___ -{[-syl or (+long)] #œÉ PosSuffix} In Ia, A noun root gains a possessive suffix at the lexical level, feeding IIa, in which -ni- is inserted between each bimoraic-final root and pre-syllable-boundary consonant-initial possessive suffix. ::Ib. /'NounRoot'- + -'PossessiveSuffix'/ ‚Üí ['NounRoot-PossessiveSuffix'] ::IIb. √∏ ‚Üí [-ni-] / {NounRoot}- ___ -{PosSuffix} Over time, process a may have generalized into process b, in which Ib feeds IIb, allowing a -ni- to optionally be inserted between any noun root and any possessive suffix.

Ata is the common name given to the long skeletal remains of a human fetusOrigin of 'six-inch mummy' confirmed. BBC News. 22 March 2018. found in 2003 in a deserted Chilean town in the Atacama Desert. DNA analysis done in 2018 on the premature human fetus identified unusual mutations associated with dwarfism and scoliosis, though these findings were later disputed. The remains were found by Oscar Mu√±oz, who later sold them; the current owner is Ram√≥n Navia-Osorio, a Spanish businessman.  Overview  DNA analysis on the premature human fetus identified unusual mutations associated with dwarfism and scoliosis, although other research contested genetic abnormalities, finding that the skeleton showed normal fetal development. There is unfounded speculation by people such as UFO theorist Steven M. Greer that Ata is an extraterrestrial. Such speculation led to Ata's inclusion in the 2013 UFO movie Sirius and captured the attention of Stanford University geneticist Garry P. Nolan, who contacted the production team and analyzed the remains of the skeleton. The results of his DNA analysis are inconsistent with the aforementioned speculations that the skeleton could be of extraterrestrial origin. Analysis Although initially thought to be older, the fetal remains have been dated to as recently as the late 1970s, and have been found to contain high-quality DNA, suitable for scientific analysis. The remains have an irregularly shaped skull and a total of 10 ribs (as opposed to 12 for adult humans), and potential signs of oxycephaly. Considering that the frontal suture of the skull is very open and the hands and feet not fully ossified, anatomist and paleoanthropologist William Jungers has suggested that it was a human fetus that was born prematurely and died before or shortly after birth. An alternative hypothesis by Nolan is that Ata had a combination of genetic disorders that led to the fetus being aborted before term, and pediatric radiologist Ralph Lachman has said that dwarfism alone could not account for all the features found in the fetus. During the DNA analysis by Nolan, the B2 mtDNA haplotype group was found in the remains. Haplogroups identify human genetic populations that often are associated distinctly with particular geographic regions around the globe. Combined with the alleles found in the mitochondrial DNA contained in the remains, the findings suggested that Ata is indigenous to the western region of South America. In March 2018, Nolan published additional results, stating that the fetus had a rare bone aging disorder, as well as other genetic mutations in genes associated with dwarfism, scoliosis, and abnormalities in the muscles and skeleton.No, It's Not an Alien ‚Äî Here's What That Tiny, Pointy-Headed Skeleton Really Is.

The researchers identified 64 unusual mutations in 7 genes linked to the skeletal system,This strange 'alien' skeleton is actually a human fetus with genetic bone defects. Warren, Matt. Science, 22 March 22 2018. and they noted that finding so many mutations that specifically affect skeletal development has never been reported before.  Controversy  A subsequent study by an international research team, led by University of Otago bioarchaeologist Associate Professor Sian Halcrow, questioned the study published in March 2018 by Nolan, stating: \\"As experts in human anatomy and skeletal development, we find no evidence for any of the skeletal anomalies claimed by the authors. Their observations of ‚Äòanomalies‚Äô represent normal skeletal development in the fetus, cranial moulding from delivery, and potential post-mortem taphonomic effects\\" and that the team was \\"sceptical\\" concerning the genomic results. The authors also raised ethical concerns about the work by Nolan, saying \\"...studies such as these that do not address ethical considerations of the deceased and their descendant communities threaten to undo the decades of work anthropologists and others have put in to correct past colonialist tendencies.\\" The publisher of the earlier study, Genome Research, responded by stating that the ethical standards did not cover work on \\"...specimens of uncertain biological origins, such as the Atacama skeleton,\\" but also stated their intention to review their own policies on such studies. The authors of the Genome Research article published a response acknowledging the ethical concerns and calling for the repatriation of the remains. They distanced themselves from possible ethical missteps by largely claiming ignorance about the handling of the remains and the circumstances of the discovery, and noting that they were presented with roughly a cubic millimeter of bone to analyze.

They are minerals in the beryl group of silicates. For more than 4,000 years, emeralds have been among the most valuable of all jewels on Earth. Colombia, located on the continent of South America, is the country that mines and produces the most emeralds for the global market. It is estimated that Colombia accounts for 70-90% of the world's emerald market. While commercial grade emeralds are quite plentiful, fine and extra fine quality emeralds are extremely rare. Colombian emeralds over 50 carat can cost much more than diamonds of the same size. The Colombian departments of Boyac√° and Cundinamarca, both in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, are the locations where most of the emerald mining takes place. Although the Colombian emerald trade has a rich history that dates as far back as the pre-Columbian era, the increase in worldwide demand for the industry of the gemstones in the early 20th century has led prices for emeralds to nearly double on the global market. Until 2016, the Colombian emerald trade was at the center of Colombia's civil conflict, which has plagued the country since the 1950s.  History of emerald extraction   Pre-Colombian period  For thousands of years, emeralds have been mined and considered one of the world's most valuable jewels. The first ever recorded emeralds date back to ancient Egypt, where they were particularly admired by Queen Cleopatra. In addition to their aesthetic value, emeralds were highly valued in ancient times because they were believed to increase intelligence, protect marriages, ease childbirth, and thought to enable its possessor the power of predicting future events.  Ancient emerald myths  An ancient Colombian legend exists of two immortal human beings, a man and a woman‚Äînamed Fura and Tena‚Äîcreated by the Muisca god Are in order to populate the earth. The only stipulation by Are was that these two human beings had to remain faithful to each other in order to retain their eternal youth. Fura, the woman, however, did not remain faithful. As a consequence, their immortality was taken away from them. Both soon aged rapidly, and they eventually died. Are later took pity on the unfortunate beings and turned them into two crags protected from storms and serpents and in whose depths Fura's tears became emeralds. Today, the Fura and Tena peaks, rising approximately 840 and 500 meters, respectively, above the valley of the Minero River, are the official guardians of Colombia's emerald zone. They are located roughly 30 km north of the mines of Muzo, the location of the largest emerald mines in Colombia.  Colonial and independence periods  Historians believe the indigenous Indians of Colombia mastered the art of mining as early as 500 AD. But Spanish Conquistadors are the ones who are credited with discovering and marketing globally what we now call Colombian emeralds. Colombia, during pre-colonial times, was occupied by Muzo indigenous people, who were overpowered by Spain in the mid 1500s. It took Spain five decades to overpower the Muzo Indians who occupied this entire mining area. Once in control, the Spanish forced this native, indigenous population to work the mining fields that it previously held for many centuries. Monarchs and the gem-loving royalty in India, Turkey, and Persia eventually sought the New World treasures once the gems arrived in Europe. These new emerald owners expanded their private collections with spectacular artifacts bedazzled with emeralds between 1600 and 1820, the time frame of Spain's control over the Colombian mines. After Colombia's independence from Spain in 1819, the new government and other private mining companies assumed mining operations. Over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, these mines were periodically shut down numerous times because of political situations within the country.  Geology   Western belt  The western emerald belt of Colombia stretches across northwestern Cundinamarca and southwestern Boyac√° to the extreme south of Santander, from La Palma and Topaip√≠ in the southwest to La Belleza and Flori√°n in the northeast.Reyes et al., 2006, p.105 The main municipalities of the western belt are: * Muzo * San Pablo de Borbur * Pauna * Otanche * Qu√≠pama * Marip√≠ * Coper * Brice√±o * Yacop√≠ * El Pe√±√≥n The emeralds occur mainly in hydrothermal mineralizations in the Rosablanca, Paja, Muzo and Furatena Formations,Reyes et al., 2006, p.106 the latter named after the mythical cacica Furatena. Furatena was the owner of the finest emeralds of the Muzo territories before the Spanish conquest.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, p.98 Major mines of this area are: * Muzo mine * Coscuez mine * Las Pavas * La Pita * Pe√±as Blancas mine * La Palma mine * Yacop√≠ mine * Quipama mine Small airports serving the western belt are Furatena Airport and Muzo Airport.  Eastern belt  The eastern belt of the emerald region of the Eastern Ranges is located in the east of Cundinamarca and southeast of Boyac√°, at around distance from the western belt.Rodr√≠guez & Solano, 2000, p.86 Main areas are:Acosta & Ulloa, 2002, p.76 * Chivor * Somondoco * Gachal√° * Almeida * Guateque * Macanal * Ubal√° The emeralds occur mostly in the Macanal, Las Juntas and Guavio Formations. Major mines are: * Chivor mine * Somondoco mine * Gual√≠ mine * La Vega de San Juan * Las Cruces * El Diamante * La Estrella * El Perro * La Mula * El Toro  Regional geology  Characteristics of 'Colombian' emeralds Emerald, Muzo Mine, Vasquez-Yacop√≠ Mining District, Colombia Geologically speaking, Colombian emeralds are said to be the purest emeralds in the world because Colombian emerald deposits are the only ones on earth found in sedimentary host rock rather than in Igneous rock. The tectonic movements that created the Andes Mountains force the raw materials of emeralds‚Äîberyllium, chromium, and vanadium‚Äîfound in the ground into liquid and gaseous states. These materials, in such states, find their way into cracks in the already sedimentary medium surrounding them and then eventually cool and crystallize. A saline solution found in the sedimentary rock eventually washes out impurities such as iron that cloud other beryls from forming onto the crystallizing stone. This intricate process produces the emeralds found in the mines of Colombia. An emerald is actually a beryllium stone that owes its special color to beryllium, chromium, and vanadium, all of which are chemical elements that are very scarce, and the reason for the color of an emerald. Colombian emeralds are much sought after, and not just because of their superb quality and color. A gem's value depends upon its size, purity, color and brilliance. Even when they are mined in the same area, each individual emerald has its own unique look that sets it apart from the rest. Dark green is considered to be the most beautiful, scarce, and valuable color for emeralds. An emerald of this color is considered rare and is only found in the deepest mines of Colombia.  Mining areas in Colombia  Emerald, Muzo Mine, Vasquez- Yacop√≠ Mining District, Boyac√° Department The eastern portion of the Andes, between the Boyac√° and Cundinamarca departments, is where most Colombian emeralds are mined. The three major mines in Colombia are Muzo, Coscuez, and Chivor. Muzo and Coscuez are on long-term leases from the government to two Colombian companies, while Chivor is a privately owned mine. Muzo remains the most important emerald mine in the world to this date. The terms Muzo and Chivor do not always refer to the particular mines that carry the same name. Instead, the two terms, originating from the local indigenous language, often describe the quality and color of emeralds. Muzo refers to a warm, grassy- green emerald, with hints of yellow. Chivor, on the other hand, describes a deeper green color. There are also many other smaller emerald mines in Colombia which produce emeralds of all different grades, but these emeralds are usually of lower quality than the ones extracted from any of the three major mining areas.  Negative by-products of the Colombian emerald trade: The Green War  Colombia has dealt with a civil war starting from the mid-1950s that is still taking place in the country today. This sixty-year conflict between left-wing guerrilla groups, right-wing paramilitary groups, Colombian drug cartels, and the government, has displaced millions and has killed thousands of people. The emerald trade is at the center of funding this ongoing civil conflict in Colombia. Emeralds have helped fund many of the armed non-state actors (NSAs) involved in the Colombian internal conflict through means of emerald smuggling and the selling of these precious stones on the international black market. The international demand for emeralds is currently at an all-time high, which secures the continued funneling of millions of dollars annually to illicit organizations in Colombia that acquire and sell emeralds on illegal premise in order to fund their existences.  Dangers of the Colombian emerald trade  Because of their value on the international market, Colombian emeralds create a large illicit trade. Emerald smugglers, called guaqueros, poach on the mines, particularly along the Itoco River in the Muzo valley. During the day they scour the river beds and scavenge the mining fields for overlooked emeralds in private mines. By night, these smugglers try to rob safe houses that store the rough emeralds before they are able to be transported to safer areas. Guaqueros often compete with other guaqueros for the same loots, most of which return a large profit on the black market. This illegal mining activity is monitored by the National Police, but arrests are infrequent and jail sentences are usually short.

History The Goulburn Chronicle and Southern Advertiser, made its debut appearance on Saturday 7 July 1855. At this time, it joined the Southern District's only other newspaper, The Goulburn Herald and County of Argyle Advertiser. The Chronicle was an 8-page liberal paper published weekly, with a particular interest in land issues.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article703348 The Chronicle continued until 1864, at which time it ceased independent publication when it was taken over by rival newspaper, the Goulburn Herald. With the merger of the two papers, the first issue of the newly incorporated Goulburn Herald and Chronicle appeared on 1 April 1864. Editors and apprentices Founders of The Chronicle in 1855 were William Edward Vernon and Ludolf Theodore Mellin, who had begun their working relationship as printers of the Illustrated Sydney News. On announcing the cessation of their \\"part-proprietorship\\" with that journal in March 1854, they then approached Goulburn solicitor and political activist Daniel Deniehy to offer him an editorial share in their new venture, The Goulburn Chronicle. Deniehy declined the offer, being unable to afford two hundred pounds for the third share. By July 1855, after some initial setup difficulties, Vernon and Mellins' new paper, The Goulburn Chronicle and Southern Advertiser, was in production. Notice of the indenture of Patrick Meehan as an apprentice in 1857 to the Goulburn Chronicle and Southern Advertiser In 1857, at the age of 14, Patrick Meehan was taken on for a five- year apprenticeship in letterpress printing at The Chronicle. His indenture continued for two years, until Mellin was charged with Meehan's assault. The case was dismissed, but Meehan's indentures were subsequently cancelled by a court order. Alfred Ellis, former sub-editor of the Empire (newspaper), joined The Chronicle in 1860, building its circulation almost equal to that of the Herald. Ellis left The Chronicle in 1863 due to ill health, retiring to nearby Jerrara Creek. On 2 January 1862, at age 35, Chronicle founder William Edward Vernon died after a lengthy period of suffering from facial cancer in the lower lip. Surviving him were his pregnant wife Margaret, and five children. The sale of Vernon's interests and property from The Chronicle partnership were announced in June 1863. Mellin continued in proprietorship of The Chronicle for a short period following Vernon's death. Shortly thereafter The Chronicle was bought out by rival publishers, William Russell Riley and John W Chisholm of The Goulburn Herald. Subsequently, Ludolf Mellin returned to Sydney where he progressively took over the control of his father-in-law's printing business, F Cunninghame & Co, which he ran until his death aged 69 in 1895.http://oa.anu.edu.au/obituary/mellin-ludolph-theodore-16672 Digitisation The only surviving issues of The Goulburn Chronicle are from 1860 and 1861.

Their anatomy and ecology resemble many rove beetles. Ecology and anatomy The Empelinae are small beetles under 2 mm long. They have 11 antennae with loose trisegmented clubs. Their elytra nearly cover the whole of their abdomen. The tarsi, according to scientists, is 5-5-5. Some scientists theorize this is a result of their secluded habitats - forest leaf litter, fungi, and moss at a stream's edge. This makes collecting the subfamily's species hard. Due to the seclusion of the Empelinae, like many rove beetles, (see Aleocharinae), the subfamily's biology is nearly unknown. Systematics The subfamily is small, with its type genus being monotypic; the only species is Empelus brunipennis, discovered Mannerheim in 1852. One species in the subfamily is restricted to North America. However, it has been very successful there, ranging from southern Alaska to California.

She is a white wolf based on the Japanese goddess, , in Japanese mythology. Amaterasu also appears in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. Since debuting in ≈åkami, Amaterasu has garnered mostly positive reception from both video game publications and fans, often included among the top Capcom characters, best canine characters in games, and one of the best video game protagonists overall. Appearances ≈åkami According to the character's backstory, Amaterasu originally existed in the Celestial Plains, ruling over the Celestials and the mortal world as a protector deity. Alongside Waka, she battled Orochi, the eight-headed serpent who attacked and wreaked havoc upon the Celestial Plain. Waka told Amaterasu that Orochi could only be defeated by the Chosen One, a human named Nagi. Hearing this, she dragged Orochi down to the human world to wait for Nagi's birth. Meanwhile, Waka and the remaining Celestials fled into the Ark of Yamato, where all except Waka perished to an ambush of demons led by Yami, the Emperor of Eternal Darkness. With each passing year, Orochi dined on another maiden from Kamiki Village on the annual festival. Before every festival, Amaterasu appeared around the village in the form of a white wolf. The villagers assumed her to be Orochi's familiar, naming her Shiranui. Eventually, Nagi fought Orochi, and through his combined efforts with Shiranui, he was able to seal Orochi away. Shiranui, however, died from both poisoned wounds inflicted during the battle and protecting Nagi from a falling rock. Taken back to the village, she was hailed as a hero, and a statue was built in her honor. However, after her death, her Celestial Brush powers had scattered, leaving her drastically weakened, with only her original ability, Sunrise. Furthermore, the peoples' faith in the gods had dwindled, leaving her even weaker. The main story of the ≈åkami begins one hundred years after Shiranui's death. When Nagi's descendant, Susano, removes the sword Tsukuyomi that had sealed Orochi away, Orochi wastes no time in taking over Nippon (Japan) once again. Sakuya, the wood sprite, revived Amaterasu within the statue of Shiranui, giving her the Reflector Divine Retribution. Together with Issun, a loudmouth Poncle found within Sakuya's robe, Amaterasu sets off to revive the Guardian Saplings scattered across Nippon and restore the lands to their original beauty and rid them from evil's hold. Throughout her journey, Amaterasu is reunited with many of her powers, and regains people's faith in the form of Praise. Eventually, Amaterasu, with the help of Susano, manages to destroy Orochi. She then continues her journey through Nippon, regaining more of her brush techniques, and further restoring people's faith and the lands. Finally, she finds herself in Kamui at the Ark of Yamato. Boarding it with Waka, she finds herself fighting previously defeated demons, including Orochi. Having vanquished them all once again, she finally faces off against Yami. During the battle, Yami manages to strip Amaterasu of all of her powers, but she gradually regains her techniques back, until Yami destroys the Celestial Gods themselves, which destroys her powers, leaving her severely weakened and hovering towards death. With the aid of Issun, who takes up his role as the Celestial Envoy, and all the people she met, who send her praise and prayers, her power is fully restored and she is able to vanquish the evil demon once and for all. She and Waka then return to the Celestial Plain to restore it, and finally bring peace and harmony back to the world. Other video games Outside of ≈åkami, Amaterasu appears as a playable character in the fighting game Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and its update Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3. A Palico costume for Capcom's Monster Hunter Generations based on Amaterasu was offered as part of the game's downloadable content. To coincide with the PC release of ≈åkami HD, Capcom created and got approval for an Amaterasu \\"courier\\" for Valve's Dota 2, given free to those who had pre-ordered ≈åkami HD on Steam. In 2020, Amaterasu was announced as a playable hero in Teppen who would be added on October of the same year. Other media Amaterasu also appears in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover between its Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog titles, where she is one of many Capcom and Sega heroes recruited by Wood Man and Princess Sally Acorn to battle Sigma. Creation and design ≈åkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. Amaterasu's initial designs were aimed to avoid having the character look like \\"your pet wearing clothing\\". The developers had considered having Amaterasu change into a dolphin when in the water and a falcon when jumping off a cliff, but dropped these ideas. Reception The character was very well received by fans and critics alike. IGN's Cam Shea said Amaterasu \\"has a delightful duality. At once a powerful goddess, capable of making sweeping changes to the world, she's also in turn a wolf pup, digging into the earth in search of treasure.\\" Opposing her to the game clich√© of \\"The Animal with Attitude\\", GamesRadar stated she \\"doesn't need 'attitude.' She has majesty, wisdom and grace instead.\\" In 2010, readers of the Japanese magazine Famitsu voted Amaterasu into eighth place in a poll for the best video game character of all time. In the same year, in a Dengeki poll, she was voted fourth as a character readers wanted to befriend. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked her as the 49th \\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in games. Amaterasu ranked as the fifth best PlayStation dog according to PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, as \\"rarely has a dog been as beautiful as the glorious work of art;\\" a similar list by Joystick Division in 2011 declared her \\"the most brilliant canine protagonist of any video game\\"; the same happened in UGO Networks' \\"Top 10 Video Game Dogs\\".

Lung cancer is a disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in the lung tissue. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lungs in a process called metastasis, into nearby tissues or other parts of the body.  Lung cancer and genetics  Lung cancer is one of the most lethal and common forms of cancer worldwide. Pollution, smoking (active and passive), radiation (in the form of x-rays or gamma rays) and asbestos are risk factors for lung cancer. Symptoms may include persistent cough, chest pain, coughing up blood, fatigue, and swelling of the neck and face. There are different types of lung cancers, which can metastasize. Treatments include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. The treatment aimed at killing the cancer can also eliminate functioning lung cells (leukocytes). Specific genetic factors can add to the risk of developing lung cancer. There are regions on chromosomes which are highly susceptible to mutation and, if present, increase the risk of developing lung cancer. These loci are the specific locations of a gene or a DNA sequence on a chromosome. Several loci are associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Approximately 26 different genes can mutate into one type of lung cancer, known as carcinoma. An example is the MAP pathway, which is inhibited by ME (a lung cancer treatment). The risk of developing lung cancer is higher for those with a family history of the disease. A second way the risk could go up is if the individual lives with a smoker.  Chromosomes involved  Many chromosomes are involved in the development of lung cancer, but those that greatly increase one's susceptibility to developing lung cancer are loci 15q25, 5p15, and 6p21. The locus 5p15 spans about 181 million base pairs on the short arm of chromosome 5, which is the largest chromosome. The locus 15q25 on chromosome 15 has genetic variants such as the CHRNA5-CHRNA3 locus, which also increases lung cancer susceptibility. Smoke is one of these risk factors: rs12914385, and rs8042374 are treated in cases where smoking is the known cause of lung cancer.  Gene expression, carcinogenic mechanisms, susceptibility chromosomes  Abnormal gene expression in chromosome loci, such as 5p15 and 15q25, is strongly linked with the risk for developing lung cancer. Gene expression, or the \\"turning on\\" of the gene, can directly affect the chromosome by changing the coding system. The process of lung cancer development transforms healthy cells into cancer cells, which can then metastasize to different parts of the body.  Susceptibility loci at chromosomes, disease markers and genes  In a large number of cases, the locus in chromosome region 15q25, which is strongly associated with lung cancer risk, was found to account for 14% (attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or of one's propensity for smoking tobacco. The associated region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary endocrine cells, and lung cancer cell lines, and they bind to N'-nitroglycerine and potential lung carcinogens. A non-synonymous variant of CHRNA5, which induces an amino acid substitution (D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein, is among the markers with the strongest disease associations.

Each Rubber Duck is recreated anew locally, as his public art is intended to be temporary. Artist Rubber Duck was created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman. In a 2013 interview, Hofman stated that his initial inspiration came from a 2001 museum visit combined with a popular yoghurt advertisement in the Netherlands in 2000 or 2001. He searched to find what he considered the perfect toy duck and settled on a design by a Hong Kong company called Tolo Toys. The yoghurt company Yogho!Yogho! financed the work. Sculpture Design The size of the rubber duck varies. His largest rubber duck, in Saint-Nazaire, France, measured, width, length, height of . The rubber duck in Beijing was , and the rubber duck in Seokchon lake was with a weight of . The rubber duck was constructed with more than 200 pieces of PVC. All the pieces of PVC are connected by hand with sewing machines. In order to enhance the duck's durability, they added another piece on top of one layer. On the rubber duck, there is an opening at the back of the body so that architects and staff can perform a body check of the rubber duck. In addition, there is an electric propeller fan in its body so that it can be inflated at any time, in either good or bad weather. The loops that are in the pontoon edges of the rubber duck are connected to the fence of the lake by 16 ropes that are designed to hold the rubber duck still without it floating away by the waves of the lake water. On the bottom of the rubber duck, there is a waterproof cable that gets the energy from a power distribution board near the lake to make the electric propeller fan work.Avenuel Art Hall, Lotte Gallery.

It was on display in Pittsburgh as its first U.S. destination, from 27 September 2013 through 20 October 2013. Over 1,000,000 people are reported to have visited the duck in Pittsburgh. Its second United States appearance was in Norfolk, Virginia, from 17‚Äì26 May 2014, floating in The Hague Inlet in front of the Chrysler Museum of Art. In October 2014, South Korea's Lotte group asked for the giant rubber duck to celebrate the opening of the new Lotte World Mall, the country's largest shopping mall that also has a skyscraper, Lotte World Tower. The tower is located between the Han River and Seokchon Lake, where the giant rubber duck was placed. However, the duck deflated during the exhibition. In 2009, while it was on display in Belgium, vandals stabbed Rubber Duck 42 times. While on display in Hong Kong in 2013, it deflated on 15 May. It was re-inflated and was again on exhibition on 20 May. It was damaged and deflated again in Taiwan on 2 November after an earthquake, before bursting at Keelung, Taiwan, on 31 December 2013. The duck was reported as having been swept away in recent floods in China. On 30 September 2017, during its exhibition in Santiago, the duck accidentally crashed into a sign, which tore a hole on its structure and caused it to deflate. A \\"counterfeit\\" version of the duck went on tour around Canada in 2017 for Canada's sesquicentennial. The tour drew some controversy as it was seen by some as a waste of government spending;https://www.blogto.com/arts/2017/05/people-upset-about-200k-cost- giant-rubber-duck-ontario/ however reports later found that the sculpture generated profits for the events it attended.https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/10/12/giant-rubber-duck- was-all-it-was-quacked-up-to-be-after-all.html This version was not approved by Studio Florentijn Hofman.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBPoPByXYAA3-g0.jpg  Censorship  On 4 June 2013, Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, blocked the terms \\"Today\\", \\"Tonight\\", \\"June 4\\", and \\"Big Yellow Duck\\", because Chinese activists were photoshopping the Rubber Duck sculpture into the Tank Man photo of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

He was a member of the late 1960s English group the Marbles, whose biggest hit was the UK No. 5 \\"Only One Woman\\". Early life Gordon was born in Blackpool, Lancashire, England as Trevor Gordon Grunnill He emigrated to Sydney, Australia with his family in the late 1950s. Career While still in high school, Gordon found work as a boy singer on the popular \\"Johnny O'Keefe\\" TV show leading to an exclusive contract with ABC, the Australian Television Network. This led to many live and TV appearances and Gordon was eventually made the host of his own Saturday afternoon kid's television program. During this time he met and befriended Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb who were finding their own success in Australia as the Bee Gees. Gordon played lead guitar on several early Bees Gees tracks that appeared on the Bee Gees first album, The Bee Gees Sing and Play 14 Barry Gibb Songs. Gordon secured a record contract with Leedon Records and released the singles, \\"House Without Windows\\" and \\"And I'll Be Happy\\" (both songs written by Barry Gibb and credited to 'Trevor Gordon and the Bee Gees'), In 1965, Gordon recorded other Barry Gibb compositions: \\"Little Miss Rhythm and Blues\\" and \\"Here I Am\\". After returning to London in 1967, Gordon teamed up musically with his first cousin Graham Bonnet and eventually the pair became a musical duo called the Marbles. Not long after Gordon reconnected with his old mates, the Bee Gees, by now also in London and fast becoming international recording stars. The Gibbs helped Gordon and Bonnet secure a recording contract with the Australian record impresario, Robert Stigwood. Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb wrote six songs for the Marbles and also provided some background vocals on their recordings, the most successful being the hit, \\"Only One Woman\\". With Bonnet's powerful vocals taking over the Marbles sound, Gordon felt under utilized and the duo soon disbanded. Gordon secured a contract with Polydor Records in London and released one album called Alphabet. Gordon was also a cast member of the Billy Cotton TV program in the UK before giving up performing and becoming a music teacher. The Marbles were typical one-hit wonders because \\"Only One Woman\\" became their one and only major hit. It reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1968, Following the release of the group's debut single, Bonnet made a remark to a reporter as to \\"Only One Woman\\" being a bit boring, angering Barry. Their second single \\"The Walls Fell Down\\" only reached Number 28 in the same chart. But in the Netherlands it was more successful, where it reached Number 3 in their Top 40 in April 1969. Later years and death In 1970, Gordon released his first and only solo album Alphabet on Polydor Records. He later became a high school music teacher. On 9 January 2013, after not being heard from for several weeks, Gordon was found dead in his London flat. His high school friend, singer/film director, Peter Foldy, called London police from Los Angeles, asking them to check up on Gordon. Says Foldy in a press release: \\"Trevor was a sweet funny guy with tons of talent. He will be missed.\\" Before his death, Gordon had published a book called Caged for Jazz Guitar - a Chord Shaped Approach to Jazz Mastery. The cause of death has not been announced pending an autopsy by the West London coroner's office in Fulham, but Gordon's death was thought to be from natural causes.

Early life and education Burditt was born at St. Anthony's Hospital on the West Side of Chicago, but grew up in La Grange, Illinois. He attended Lyons Township High School in Lagrange, starring on the basketball team (and later being inducted into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame), and serving as valedictorian upon his graduation in 1940. Burditt went on to attend Harvard, completing his degree in 1944 while also serving as a pilot in the Air Force from 1943 to 1945. He followed this with a degree from Harvard Law School after the war, graduating in 1948. Legal career After his graduation from Harvard Law, Burditt entered legal practice in Chicago, first at the firm of Chadwell, Keck, Kayser, Ruggles & McLaren, and later at Swift & Co. In 1969, Burditt started his own law firm, Burditt & Calkins. This firm later became part of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd, which was later acquired by K&L; Gates. Burditt continued practicing law, later at his daughter's firm, until the final months of his life at age 90. He was recognized as \\"the dean of attorneys in the United States practicing food and drug law.\\" In addition to his legal practice and political and charity work, Burditt taught as an adjunct member of the faculty at Northwestern University Law School for thirty years, from 1967 to 1997. Political career Burditt took to political life quickly in the 1950s, chairing the Young Republicans of Cook County from 1952 to 1953. He served as state vice-chair of the Eisenhower reelection campaign in 1956, and in numerous other capacities. In 1964, Burditt was elected as a Republican member of the Illinois House of Representatives, in an unprecedented statewide at-large election. In subsequently elections, he ran in the 9th state legislative district; he held this seat until 1972. In the 77th General Assembly of Illinois, 1971‚Äì1972, Burditt served as Assistant Majority Leader. During his career, he sponsored numerous reforms of food and drug safety and environmental law; he was the chief sponsor of the 1970 Illinois Environmental Protection Act and the Illinois Endangered Species Act. In 1974, Burditt ran against Adlai Stevenson III for the US Senate, but lost due to a nationwide wave of anti-Republican sentiment following the Ford pardon of Nixon. He did not run for office again after this, although he remained active behind the scenes. Charitable work Burditt was highly active in the nonprofit sphere, serving as trustee and donor to numerous Chicago-area institutions, including the Newberry Library. Organizations he chaired at one point or another included the Chicago Bar Association, Harvard Law School Association, Citizens of Greater Chicago, Chicago Civic Association, and the Junior Association of Commerce and Industry. In addition, from 1964 to January 1967, Burditt served as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Shimer College, then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois; he had joined the board in 1956. His tenure as chairman overlapped with the period in this tiny school's history known as the \\"Grotesque Internecine Struggle\\", a bitter political fight between younger faculty and students on the one hand and older faculty and the administration on the other. Although he was not directly involved, a letter sent by Burditt played a galvanizing role in the struggle: > A week long campaign by the Apathy Committee climaxed on December with a > panel discussion featuring students, faculty, and administrators. Three days > later Dr. David Weiser received a letter from George Burditt, chairman of > the Board of Trustees, suggesting that he resign. Apathy hasn't been > mentioned since.

Notable for its unique action even among soft lures, wacky style is used to heighten the chance at catching finicky fish on harsh days, although at the expense of lowering the chances of very large fish, because the size of the bait is very small, allowing bass of all sizes to take the bait. Unlike the Texas rig and Carolina rig, both sides of the wacky rig flutter, creating a more natural action.Unusual Action Makes Wacky Rigs Top Choice for Spring Bass  Pro Bass Fishing Class The name comes from its unusual style of attaching a plastic worm through the middle of the body instead of on one end.Events Calendar  Yamaha Outboards  Set Up  The wacky rig is considered a simple but effective way to fish. Worms between four and six inches are generally used, but some use creature baits resembling crayfish and small fishes. Stick worms, those that have the same diameter throughout the length and a straight tail, are the most used, although tapered worms and tailed worms can be used. Stick worms are heavier, giving a more erratic action on the dive. Almost any hook can be used, as long as it's generally smaller than hooks used for Texas rig and Carolina rig, as large hooks may scare away potential bites from smaller fish. The hook is inserted through the middle of the plastic, leaving the end of the hook exposed. A thinner line than usual, from six to ten pound test, is used. Both monofilament fishing line and fluorocarbon may be used. These tackle heighten the chances of a bite. The two kinds of weights used are nail weights and ring weights. Nail weights are inserted through the head of the worm for different action and deeper fishing. With a nail as a weight, the lure will have an irregular action while gliding to the bottom. Ring weights are also used to fish at deeper depths, and they have the advantage of inserting the hook both through the worm and the ring simultaneously. Although fishing companies produce nail weights specifically for wacky rigging, one may use nails commonly found in tool boxes to save money. The weights allow for fishing at deeper depths, from ten up to forty feet. Any rods in general may be used. Longer rods allow for longer casts, but shorter rods give accuracy to the cast. Some anglers even use braid with a fluorocarbon leader.The Wacky Rig Is The Height Of Simplicity And Effectiveness  Usage and Technique  The wacky rig can be used all year round, but is not considered to be as effective during winter months due to the sluggish nature of basses, although large winter bass have been caught using it. Clearer waters are generally thought to be better conditions for wacky styling than stained and murky waters.Finesse's Wacky tips  Bassmaster The lure can be used anywhere, from cover to vegetation to open waters to skipping under docks.Wacky Rigging Soft Baits  Berkley Fishing One would cast the rig out into targeted areas where bass may be, enticing a reaction bite. While letting the 'Senko' bait fall on slack line, one may also lift the rod to give the worm a moving look and keep it above ground longer. If left for up to a minute and still no bite, one should shake the line to give the appearance of a moving organism, or lift up the rod and let the lure fall to the ground again.

The company creates software and hardware products in the B2B emerging education technology space. The company organizes the Academy of Play, and trains Adult Educators, Teachers and HR professionals on the use of AR/VR, Serious Games and Simulations for Training and Education.  History  Playware Studios Pte Ltd was founded in 2005. The company started as a serious games company creating games for the Ministry of Education in Singapore and has focused on using information communication technology to deliver education to students. From 2005 to 2008, the company developed over 50 serious games titles. Since 2008, Playware has moved towards the education technology space, focusing on game based learning products, with some of the most notable being FutureSchools@Singapore and Classroom of the Future projects with the Singapore Ministry of Education, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore and the National Institute of Education of Singapore. The company introduced the concept of \\"Hiving\\", an emergent game play and user-generated media that can be used by teachers and students through the 3DHive platform to bring engaged learning into the classroom. Since Hiving was introduced through the FutureSchools@Singapore programme, the opportunity for the development of infocomm-enabled pedagogies has been possible. Schools are also able to re-design curriculum and assessment tools by incorporating them into the platform; changing their effective administration practices. Canberra Primary School was the first school to incorporate CanberraLIVE, an integrated virtual learning environment incorporating immersive virtual reality gaming, multi-modal digital media and mobile learning application. For schools in Singapore, 3DHive is SSOE compliant and can be installed on all Ministry of Education devices. It is also part of an approved list of software for Singapore schools to be used in their Infocomm Clubs programme sponsored by the Infocomm Development Authority. Playware Studios was a finalist in Microsoft‚Äôs 2013 Partner of the Year awards under the category for Public Sector Partner of the Year ‚Äì Education. In December 2014 Playware Studios‚Äô 3DHive was selected as the Singapore winner of the first Bett Asia & IDA EdTech Excellence Award. Playware Studios was one of 10 companies ‚Äì five from Singapore and five international ‚Äì which were shortlisted to pitch at the Bett Asia & IDA EdTech Excellence Award jointly organised by Bett Asia and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA). Under the Innovative Learning 2020 (iN.Learn 2020), launched by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), Jurong Health, partnered with Playware to train their nurses using virtual reality games. Nurses can use these games to practise the steps to resuscitate a patient or learn about post-operation care. Ms Prema Balan, senior assistant director in nursing education at Jurong Health Services, said the virtual reality game it uses has helped to alleviate constraints in booking training facilities. \\"With this, you can just use it anywhere,\\" she said. Playware Studios was one of the multiple award winners for Brandan Hall group's Excellence in Technology awards 2015.  Products   3DHive  Launched at the end of 2012, 3DHive was originally built for the FutureSchools@Singapore project in a 4-year collaboration with the Ministry Of Education, National Research Foundation and Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore. Playware Studios collaborated with the team at Canberra Primary School to create 3DHive, an integrated, holistic, pervasive games for learning platform built from the ground up for use in the classroom.[8] Integrated into Microsoft‚Äôs Azure platform, the software is for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Kinect-for-Windows.‚Äù 3DHive is used as an educational games platform to classrooms and more than 500 teachers from 100 K-12 schools and institutions of higher learning in Singapore have been trained to use the platform and students, ranging from primary to secondary school, have learnt and built their own games. The platform is now being used by schools for game-based and scenario-based learning, integrated project work and for co-curricular activities. It has been used for diverse subjects such as Mathematics, History, Chinese and Character Education. Through the platform‚Äôs point-and- click game editor software, educators and students are able to input User- Generated-Content; allowing users to learn whilst playing a serious game. It is cloud-hosted without any setup or overhead costs and has built-in tools for collaboration, classroom management and assessment. In 2012, the Supreme Court of Singapore used 3DHive to build ‚ÄòThe Learning Court‚Äô, a game to showcase a virtual version of the Supreme Court. The Workforce Development Agency of Singapore also used it to create a role-play game called ‚ÄòExplore CI WSQ Virtual World‚Äô for an exhibition on creative industries. 3DHive was originally built for the FutureSchools@Singapore project in a 4-year collaboration with Ministry Of Education, National Research Foundation and Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore. Playware Studios collaborated with the team at Canberra Primary School to create 3DHive, an integrated, holistic, pervasive games for learning platform built from the ground up for use in the classroom. In 2014, The 'Every Door is Right Door' Simulation Training Programme, built on 3DHive and developed for the Civil Service College, Singapore won the Brandon Hall Group Excellence in Learning Awards (Bronze) for the Best Use of Games and Simulations for Learning. In 2015 3DHive won two Brandon Hall Excellence in Technology awards; a Silver for Best Advance in Gaming or Simulation Technology as well as a Bronze for Best Advance in Mobile Learning Technology. In the annual National Primary Game Creation Competition (NPGCC) organised by Wellington Primary School 3DHive is one of the platforms used by primary school students in Singapore to create games about financial literacy.

The platform has been demonstrated at various conferences including EXCELFest, Games Convention Asia 2009 and ICTLT 2008. The platform allows many people to interact with it (and through it with each other) in one location at the same time. A new concept was coined to describe 4DI's development, called PM3. It describes the platform experience as polyvalent, multimodal and multimedia. The 4Di system has a panoramic projection that can be scaled to a very wide view of the virtual world and wrapped around a room, including its floor and roof. Its 3D audio effects allow positional sound to add to the immersion. The first version was built for Canberra Primary School for the purpose of supporting learning through play, one of the core thrusts of the school's FutureSchool@Singapore programme. Dubbed Canberra Live!, the programme lets pupils interact with various immersive learning environments such as 'Historical Singapore', 'Rainforest' and 'Shanghai Expo'. A \\"lite\\" version of the 4Di system exists. More compact, it uses 3 projector screens connected to two PCs pre-loaded with 3DHive.

It is made from superhydrophobic (ultrahydrophobicity) materials. Droplets hitting this kind of coating can fully rebound.Richard, Denis, Christophe Clanet, and David Qu√©r√©. \\"Surface phenomena: Contact time of a bouncing drop.\\" Nature 417.6891 (2002): 811-811Yahua Liu, Lisa Moevius, Xinpeng Xu,Tiezheng Qian, Julia M Yeomans, Zuankai Wang. \\"Pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic surfaces.\\" Nature Physics, 10, 515-519 (2014) Generally speaking, superhydrophobic coatings are made from composite materials where one component provides the roughness and the other provides low surface energy. This image shows highly absorbent filter paper coated with a super-hydrophobic paint developed at University College London. This repels water (which has been dyed orange for greater contrast) Material used Superhydrophobic coatings can be made from many different materials. The following are known possible bases for the coating: * Manganese oxide polystyrene (MnO2/PS) nano- composite * Zinc oxide polystyrene (ZnO/PS) nano-composite * Precipitated calcium carbonate * Carbon nano-tube structures * Silica nano-coating * Fluorinated silanes and Fluoropolymer coatings. The silica-based coatings are perhaps the most cost effective to use. They are gel-based and can be easily applied either by dipping the object into the gel or via aerosol spray. In contrast, the oxide polystyrene composites are more durable than the gel-based coatings, however the process of applying the coating is much more involved and costly. Carbon nano-tubes are also expensive and difficult to produce with current technology. Thus, the silica-based gels remain the most economically viable option at present. Types of superhydrophobic coatings * Durable water repellent This being used for fabrics in order to protect them from water. * Rain repellent This is made for car windshield for repelling rain water during rain in order to improve driving visibility. Industrial uses In industry, super-hydrophobic coatings are used in ultra-dry surface applications. The coating causes an almost imperceptibly thin layer of air to form on top of a surface. Super-hydrophobic coatings are also found in nature; they appear on plant leaves, such as the Lotus leaf, and some insect wings. The coating can be sprayed onto objects to make them waterproof. The spray is anti-corrosive and anti-icing; has cleaning capabilities; and can be used to protect circuits and grids. Superhydrophobic coatings have important applications in maritime industry. They can yield skin friction drag reduction for ships' hulls, thus increasing fuel efficiency. Such a coating would allow ships to increase their speed or range while reducing fuel costs. They can also reduce corrosion and prevent marine organisms from growing on a ship's hull. In addition to these industrial applications, superhydrophobic coatings have potential uses in vehicle windshields to prevent rain droplets from clinging to the glass. The coatings also make removal of salt deposits possible without using fresh water. Furthermore, superhydrophobic coatings have the ability to harvest other minerals from seawater brine with ease. Despite the coating's many applications, safety for the environment and for workers is an issue. The International Maritime Organization has many regulations and policies about keeping water safe from potentially dangerous additives. Superhydrophobic coatings rely on a delicate micro or nano structure for their repellence--this structure is easily damaged by abrasion or cleaning; therefore, the coatings are most used on things such as electronic components, which are not prone to wear. Objects subject to constant friction like boats hulls would require constant re-application of such a coating to maintain a high degree of performance. Applications:- Due to the extreme repellence and in some cases bacterial resistance of hydrophobic coatings, there is much enthusiasm for their wide potential uses with surgical tools, medical equipment, textiles, and all sorts of surfaces and substrates. However, the current state of the art for this technology is hindered in terms of the weak durability of the coating making it unsuitable for most applications. Newer engineered surface textures on stainless steel are extremely durable and permanently hydrophobic. Optically these surfaces appear as a uniform matte surface but microscopically they consist of rounded depressions one to two microns deep over 25% to 50% of the surface. These surfaces are produced for buildings which will never need cleaning.McGuire, Michael F., \\"Stainless Steel for Design Engineers\\", ASM International, 2008. There are many non-chemical companies on the Internet offering super hydrophobic coatings for various unsuitable applications. It is important to understand the science of these coatings before attempting to use this technology: * Instead of using fluorine atoms for repellence like many successful hydrophobic penetrating sealers (not super hydrophobic), superhydrophobic products are a coating--they work by creating a micro- or nano-sized structure on a surface which has super-repellent properties. * These very tiny structures are by their nature very delicate and very easily damaged by wear, cleaning or any sort of friction; if the structure is damaged even slightly it loses its superhydrophobic properties. This technology is based on the microstructure of the hairs of a lily pad which make water just roll off. Rub a lily leaf a little and it will no longer be superhydrophobic. Unlike a lily leaf, which can heal and grow new hairs, a coating will not do this. * As a result, unless advancements can resolve the identified weakness of this technology its applications are limited. It is used mainly in sealed environments which are not exposed to wear or cleaning, such as electronic components (like the inside of smart phones) and air conditioning heat transfer fins, to protect from moisture and prevent corrosion. Surfaces can be made hydrophobic without the use of coating through the altering of their surface microscopic contours, as well. The basis of hydrophobicity is the creation of recessed areas on a surface whose wetting expends more energy than bridging the recesses expends. This so-called Wenzel-effect surface or lotus effect surface has less contact area by an amount proportional to the recessed area, giving it a high contact angle. The recessed surface has a proportionately diminished attraction foreign liquids or solids and permanently stays cleaner. This has been effectively used for roofs and curtain walls of structures that benefit from low or no maintenance.McGuire, Michael F., \\"Stainless Steel for Design Engineers\\", ASM International, 2008.

It was originally developed by Reinhard Buchaly (RB) in 1996 for the cave exploration dives conducted by the European Karst Plain Project (EKPP). About 1/10 of the respired volume of breathing gas in the circuit is discharged during each breathing cycle by a concentric bellows counterlung system, which reduces the loop volume and is replenished by internal valves, triggered by low loop volume, similar to the function of the demand valve of a scuba regulator. The Halcyon RB80 was introduced as a replacement for the much bulkier and more mechanically complex PVR-BASC, which was depth-compensated and used a ballasted bellows counterlung. Specifications *5.6 lbs (2.54 kg) scrubber absorbent load provides approximately eight hours of scrubber endurance *10:1 counterlung volume ratio provides substantial gas extension, with a loop oxygen fraction lower than the feed gas composition. The decrease in oxygen fraction depends on the supply gas oxygen concentration and the operating depth. The difference is less at greater depth, but can be quite large at shallow depths. *The inner bellows automatically vents water from the loop *Semi-closed operation eliminates the risk of unit-induced oxygen toxicity (max PPO2 is that of the supply gas connected) *Full access to on- board gas supply in either semi-closed circuit or open circuit bailout *Cylinder volume to user's choice. Large cylinders can be carried. Breathing cycle Schematic diagram of the breathing gas circuit of a passive addition semi-closed circuit rebreather. Inhalation closes the mouthpiece exhalation non-return valve and draws gas through the inhalation non-return valve. The pressure drop draws the contents of the outer bellows through the scrubber, inhalation hose, non-return valve and mouthpiece to the diver. As the concentric bellows contract, the pressure in the inner bellows increases and first closes the internal non-return valve, then pushes its contents through the outer non-return valve, discharging to the surroundings. When the bellows is fully contracted, the bottom cover triggers the gas addition valves which inject gas until the diver stops inhaling and the bottom cover no longer presses against the addition valve actuator. If the gas in the breathing circuit has been compressed by an increase in depth, the gas volume will be even less and the addition valves will be triggered for longer, bringing the volume back to the appropriate level. The RB80 uses two addition valves in parallel, so that if one fails, the other will provide the required gas. Exhalation closes the mouthpiece non-return valve in the inhalation hose and pushes gas through the exhalation hose to the bellows counterlungs which will expand to accommodate the exhaled volume. If there is an excess beyond the capacity of the fully expanded bellows, as will occur if the gas expands due to a decrease in ambient pressure during ascent, the excess gas will simply pass out through the inner counterlung's non-return valves to the surroundings. The design of internal ducting leads water in the exhalation side of the loop into the inner counterlung bellows, and from there it is discharged to the surroundings along with the gas during the inhalation stage of the cycle. Safety If the breathing gas supply is depleted, the dose of fresh breathing gas decreases until the breathing supply is used up. The diver will notice the decreasing volume of gas available which signals the need to switch to an independent open-circuit bailout system, which is integrated into the rebreather mouthpiece as a bailout valve, or to connect another supply cylinder to the rebreather. Water which leaks into, or accumulates in the breathing loop drains into the inner bellows from which it is automatically discharged into the environment along with the discharged air when the inner bellows is emptied during each inhalation. Configuration The RB80 is usually carried between a set of back mounted isolation manifolded double cylinders, supported on a backplate and wing harness. Dives in shallow open water could be done using a small single tank mounted to one side of the RB80. It can also be side-mounted for tight restrictions. Occasionally extreme dive profiles require the use of a rebreather for bailout, and the RB80 can be carried as a back mounted pair, as one back mount and one side mount, or both side mounted for those occasions. The appropriate tank size depends on the dive activity and environment. In most cases the volume of gas should be sufficient that at any time during the dive the gas remaining in the cylinders is sufficient to reach the surface on open circuit, after completing all required decompression. Gas selection is basically to use the gas that would be appropriate for an open circuit dive of the same profile. The RB80 has a dual-inlet gas manifold that allows divers to change gas mixtures during the dive to suit the depth or for decompression.  Loop gas calculation  Oxygen partial pressure in a passive addition system is controlled by the breathing rate of the diver. Feed gas is added by a valve which is equivalent to an open circuit demand valve in function, which opens to supply gas when the counterlung is empty - the moving top plate of the counterlung works like the diaphragm of a demand valve to operate the lever opening the valve when the counterlung volume is low. The volume may be low because the internal bellows has discharged a part of the previous breath to the environment, or because an increase in depth has caused the contents to be compressed, or a combination of these causes. The oxygen used by the diver also slowly decreases the volume of gas in the loop. The steady state partial pressure, F_{O_2loop}, in a passive addition loop can be calculated from the formula: :F_{O_2loop}=\\\\frac{(P_{amb}*K_{bellows}*K_E+1)F_{O_2feed}-1}{P_{amb}*K_{bellows}*K_E} Where: :P_{amb} = Ambient pressure, :K_{bellows} = Bellows ratio - the ratio between the volume of expired air in the counterlungs and the amount dumped, :K_E = Extraction ratio (ratio of minute ventilation and oxygen uptake), which usually falls in the range of 17 to 25 with a normal value of about 20 for healthy humans. Values as low as 10 and as high as 30 have been measured. Variations may be caused by the diet of the diver, the dead space of the diver and equipment, raised levels of carbon dioxide, or raised work of breathing and tolerance to carbon dioxide. :F_{O_2feed} = Oxygen fraction of the supply gas, in a consistent system of units. Oxygen consumption and feed rate are strongly related, and the steady state oxygen concentration in the loop is independent of oxygen uptake and is likely to remain within fairly close tolerances of the calculated value for a given depth. The oxygen fraction of the gas in the circuit will approximate the feed gas more closely for greater depth. The deficit between inhaled FO2 and feed gas FO2 is a function of the bellows ratio and depth. It is large near the surface and decreases with increase in depth. The inhaled FO2 remains fairly steady at any depth for a considerable range of workload, although supply gas will be used more quickly at higher workloads. The deficit will vary at constant depth with the ratio of respiratory minute ventilation to rate of oxygen consumption, as will occur in hyper- or hypoventilation. This deficit can reduce the partial pressure of oxygen in the loop to levels that will not support life, particularly at shallow depths, and there is a risk that the diver may ascend to a depth where the mix will be hypoxic. The variation in oxygen deficit means that the range of depth at which the rebreather is safe to dive is significantly less than for the same supply gas on open circuit.

The crew of the visiting American sealing brig , under the command of Capt. Isaac Pendleton, built her between April and August 1803 at what is now known as American River on Kangaroo Island. Daniel Wright, the ship's carpenter, was in charge of the construction of the Independence at the mouth of Ship Creek, 800m west of the present-day American River oval. On 15 June 1805, Independence set sail from Sydney for the Antipodes Islands (860 km south east of Dunedin New Zealand) and was never seen again. The Sydney Gazette reported the loss on 16 March 1806. Prehistory In 1802, Capt. Isaac Pendleton of Stonington, Connecticut was commissioned by Fanning & Coles of New York to sail Union to the waters of New Holland in search of seal skins. \\"Her commander (Captain Isaac Pendleton) was ‚Ä¶left unrestricted, and at perfect liberty to act on all occasions as his judgment should direct, to make the most profitable voyage he could of it for his owners.\\"Fanning 1989:230-231 quoted in Dappert & Moffatt 2007 In early 1803, whilst sealing in King George Sound near what is now Albany, Western Australia Pendleton met the French explorer, Nicolas Baudin, who recommended Kangaroo Island as a place where seals could be found in plenitude. Arriving in what is now known as Eastern Cove on the north coast of Kangaroo Island, Pendleton took the decision to winter here and, presumably to increase the quantity of skins that could be taken to Sydney, construct a smaller vessel to work alongside Union in its sealing activities. Construction and Use As was common practice at the time, Union carried the frame of a small schooner. This, possibly with the addition of some locally sourced timber, was used to build a smaller vessel. It appearsDappert & Moffat 2007 that Baudin had lost a longboat whilst surveying the coastline of Kangaroo Island and his carpenters had found suitable timber to rebuild the longboat near what is now the town of American River. As the new vessel was to be smaller than Union, it would have better access to shallow waters. Thus was born Independence. No original plans of Independence are known to exist. In fact, it is possible the original Independence was built without plans. The two ships sealed together, working around southern Australia and then shipped their seal furs to buyers including some in China, ‚ÄúThe ship Union, and schooner Independence are expected to sail this day for China.‚Äú from the Sydney Gazette 1804.

He designed some 500 residences and various public and private buildings in Sarasota, as well as commercial buildings. His Florida buildings are located from Tampa to Fort Myers with many in Nokomis. He drew the original sketches for the home of Mable and John Ringling, but the design by Dwight James Baum was selected by Mable Ringling and built by Owen Burns after Martin declined a fee reduction proposed by John Ringling. Many of Martin's buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). He was listed as a Great Floridian in 2000. History Martin was the son of William Davidson Martin and Myra Martin. His family was part of the construction business for generations. He graduated from high school in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, he moved with his family to Chicago in 1883. Thomas married Sadie W. Coffin on February 19, 1890. They had three sons and a daughter. Martin was first employed as a draftsman with Global Machinery Co. in Chicago. He apprenticed with the architectural firm of Holabird and Roche in Chicago. At that firm, Martin met Chicago socialite and art patron, Bertha Palmer, the widow of Chicago real estate developer Potter Palmer. Palmer commissioned Holabird and Roche to design her large winter home in Sarasota. Sketches for the house bear Martin's trademark signature. She soon would become one of the largest landholders in Florida and she also became renowned for her real estate developments and the introduction of revolutionary agricultural and ranching practices in Florida. At the age of forty-four, Martin came to the Sarasota area from Chicago to work for Palmer in the fall of 1910. He was joined by his wife and children in 1911. He set up his own practice, which flourished throughout the Florida land boom of the 1920s. Among the five hundred homes Martin designed in the Sarasota area, many are considered \\"Floridian\\" style homes which use glass block and formed concrete embellished with Mediterranean Revival features. In the 1930s he and his son, Clarence, were the architects for the Sarasota Municipal Auditorium. It was a federal economic stimulus project. Some Florida designs * William J.

He entered Saint Petersburg State University, Russia, in 1912 aged 20, in the Section of Biology, specializing in zoology from his second year. He graduated in 1917, and the British Consulate called him up for military service. He was exempted on medical grounds, as chronic otitis media had cause deafness in one ear since childhood. Career Soon after graduating, Hoare was appointed a Research Fellow at the University of Petrograd. He studied under the tutelage of the Professor of Zoology Valentin Dogiel. Hoare left Russia in 1920 for England. With the help of professional contacts he quickly gained a position at the National Institute for Medical Research where he began to publish a series of academic papers. He continued to correspond with his mentor, Dogiel in St Petersburg in these early years, correspondence which reveals a desire to have his Russian text books sent to England and his difficulties settling into life in England.Differing Fates by S I Fokin (in Russian) http://www.rbcu.ru/PDF/DifferFates-1.pdf In 1923, he joined the Wellcome Bureau of Scientific Research in London, under Charles Morley Wenyon. Hoare was appointed Protozoologist, and in later Head of the Department of Protozoology, a post he held for 34 years until his retirement in 1957. In 1927, Hoare left for an extended secondment to the Uganda Medical Service in Entebbe, Uganda, where he spent two years investigating the lifecycle of the crocodile trypanosomes, Trypanosome Grayi.The Wellcome Laboratories of tropical medicine [electronic resource] : 1913-1963 (1963) https://archive.org/details/b2045840x Following the Second World War, Hoare continued to publish prolifically, and undertook a number of extended visits in support of his research and colleagues around the world, visiting the United States in 1948, Lisbon, Portugal in 1958 and received a very warm welcome as a native Russian speaker when he visited the Soviet Union in 1959. Selected publications Awards and honours He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society on 16 March 1950. Family and Personal life In 1915, Hoare married his first wife, Alexandra Marti, born in Malans, Switzerland, but brought up in Russia. She was a professional pianist and taught at the Petrograd Institute of Music. Their marriage was not a happy one, and they broke up when they left Russia. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the Russian Civil War that followed, Hoare was interned along with other aliens in 1919 in a military prison, likely to have been the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg. With the help of the British Government he left Russia in 1920 for England. He was joined in England by his mother, and his sister Catherine. He stayed initially with the English family of his father, before establishing himself in Chiswick, London. Shortly after their arrival in England, Hoare's elder sister Catherine emigrated to the US, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 1928 following her marriage to a Russian emigre, Boris Speshneff-Stafford. Upon his return from Uganda, around 1930, Hoare met Marie Leserson, who was to become his second wife. They became partners and lived together in the Leserson family home in Chiswick, where Hoare was to spend most of the remainder of his life. Although living as man and wife for many years, the marriage was only formalised in 1954, a few weeks after the death of his first wife Alexandra in April 1954. Hoare's mother, Luboff, died of rectal cancer in 1931 at the Chelsea Cancer hospital, now known as The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.
