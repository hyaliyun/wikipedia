Club career Born in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Barreiro was a Valencia CF youth graduate. He made his debut as a senior with the reserves in the 2004–05 season, in Tercera División. After prolific lower league spells at CD Lalín and Algeciras CF, Barreiro joined Cádiz CF on 31 January 2008. Initially assigned to the B side, he made his first-team debut on 20 April 2008, coming on as a late substitute for Natalio in a 1–0 away win against CD Numancia for the Segunda División. Barreiro scored his first professional goal on 18 May 2008, but in a 2–5 loss at RC Celta de Vigo. After the club's relegation to Segunda División B, he was definitely promoted to the main squad. Released by Cádiz in the summer of 2009, Barreiro subsequently represented Jerez Industrial CF, Zamora CF, CCD Cerceda, Pontevedra CF and Racing de Ferrol. With the latter, he scored a career-best 21 goals in two consecutive seasons, as his team achieved promotion to the third level and missed out another in the play-offs. On 27 June 2014, Barreiro returned to division two after six years, signing for Deportivo Alavés. He scored 11 goals for the Basques during his debut campaign, including braces against CA Osasuna and CD Lugo, and added a further five in the following as they returned to La Liga after ten years. After making no league appearances during the first half of the season, Barreiro terminated his contract on 22 December 2016 and joined second tier club Gimnàstic de Tarragona just hours later. He was sent off for two bookable offenses on his debut – a 1–1 home draw to CD Tenerife – the latter for not wearing the obligatory shinpads. On 28 January 2019, Barreiro signed a three- and-a-half-year deal with Lugo.

It may find an origin in the apocryphal Apocalypse of Thomas and is found in many post-millennials s manuscripts in Latin and in the vernacular. References to it occur in a great multitude and variety of literary works, and via the Cursor Mundi it may have found its way even into the early modern period, in the works of William Shakespeare. Origin The Fifteen Signs derives from the Apocalypse of Thomas, an apocryphal apocalyptic text composed in Greek (and subsequently translated in Latin) between the second and fourth century. It exists in two versions, the second, longer one treating fifth-century events as contemporary. The first version includes a list of seven signs announcing the end of the world. The longer version, however, has an appended section which brings the list of signs up to fifteen. This version was taken up and reshaped by Irish, after which it became a source for many European visions of the end of days. Remaining versions One of its many versions can be found in the Asega-bôk. Another version can be found in the Saltair na Rann. One of the earliest versions is De quindecim signis (PL XCIV.555) written in the 8th century by Pseudo-Bede. Manuscripts *Corpus Christi College, Oxford MS 36 (fragment, 125 verses in French in octosyllabic rhyming couplets) *Bodleian Library, Oxford MS. Douce 134 (Livre de la Vigne nostre Seigneur, with miniatures of all fifteen signs): fully digitized Types The Fifteen Signs are organized in three general types: the Voragine type, the Pseudo-Bede type, and the Comestor type. The Welsh prose versions edited by William Heist are each based on any of the three; the Asega-bôk is based on both Pseudo-Bede and Comestor's Historia scholastica. Signs The fifteen signs are shown over fifteen days, though in many different varieties. According to the Welsh prose version: #The earth's waters rise above the mountains #The waters sink so low they cannot be seen anymore #The waters return to their original position #All sea animals gather on the surface and bellow unintelligibly #The waters burn from east to west #Plants and trees fill with dew and blood #Earth is divided into two parts #All buildings are destroyed #The stones fight each other #Great earthquakes occur #All mountains and valleys are leveled to a plain #Men come out from their hiding places but can no longer understand each other #The stars and constellations fall out of the sky (in the Comestor variant only stars fall) #The bones of the dead come out of their graves #All men die, the earth burns #Judgment Day Influence References to the fifteen signs are ubiquitous in medieval Western literature. In the fifteenth century, prints detailing the life of the Antichrist usually included the fifteen signs. An Anglo-Norman version was included in the fourteenth-century Cursor Mundi, and C. H. Conley argued that William Shakespeare used a reading knowledge of that poem or one like it for various details in Act 1 of Hamlet and Act 2 of Julius Caesar, details he couldn't have found in Holinshed's Chronicles. Harry Morris contends that those details could have come to Shakespeare via John Daye's A Book of Christian Prayer (1578) or the Holkham Bible (14th century). The signs also occur in the shearmen's Prophets of Antichrist, part of the fifteenth-century Chester Mystery Plays.

The species was originally thought to be a part of the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis) population until 2013, when a study of museum specimens and photographs identified distinct facial markings, which helped to differentiate it. It is distinguished by the high contrast of its black and white facial features, as well as the shape and width of the stripes of its facial markings. The species is named after the Kayan River, which runs through its native habitat. As with other slow lorises, this arboreal and nocturnal species primarily eats insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit and has a toxic bite, a unique feature among primates. Although not yet evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it is likely to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" or placed in a higher-risk category when its conservation status is assessed. It is primarily threatened by habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade. Taxonomy and phylogeny N. kayan is a strepsirrhine primate and a species of slow loris (known collectively as the genus Nycticebus), within the loris family (Lorisidae). Prior to 2013, museum specimens of this animal had been identified as the Bornean slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis), which had first been described by the English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1893 as Lemur menagensis. However, in 1939 Reginald Innes Pocock consolidated all slow lorises into a single species, N. coucang, and in his influential 1953 book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, primatologist William Charles Osman Hill also followed this course. In 1971, that view was refined by Colin Groves, who recognized the pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) as a separate species, and divided N. coucang into four subspecies, – one of those being N. coucang menagensis, the Bornean slow loris. The subspecies N. c. menagensis was elevated to the species level (as N. menagensis) in 2006, when molecular analysis showed it to be genetically distinct from N. coucang. A 2013 review of all museum specimens and photographs attributed to N. menagensis showed that they in fact comprised a species complex. First, two former subspecies of N. menagensis were elevated to the two distinct species N. bancanus and N. borneanus. Further, N. kayan was recognized as a new species that is also distinct from the nominate subspecies, N. menagensis. All newly recognized or elevated species showed significant differences in their \\"facemask\\"—the coloration patterns on their face. Analysis of the facemask patterns suggests that N. kayan diverged from N. menagensis and N. borneanus through sympatric speciation (divergent evolution of organisms living in the same geographic region), while geographic barriers may account for its divergence with N. bancanus (allopatric speciation). N. kayan is named after the Kayan River, which runs through its native habitat and near Peleben, the type locality of the original specimen. The holotype, AMNH 106012, was originally collected on 8 October 1935 by Baron V. von Plessen near Peleben in the province of East Kalimantan in Borneo and is housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It consists of a male skin and skull, with a head-body length of . Physical description Like other slow lorises, it has a vestigial tail, round head, and short ears. It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes. Like N. menagensis, this and all other Bornean species lack a second upper incisor, which distinguishes them from other slow lorises. On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved grooming claw that it uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight. It also possesses a specialized arrangement of lower front teeth, called a toothcomb, which is also used for grooming, as with other lemuriform primates. On the ventral side of its elbow, it has a small swelling called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The face mask of N. kayan differs from those of other Bornean lorises in several ways. First, the top of the dark ring around its eyes is either rounded or pointed (not diffuse at the edges) and the bottom stretches below the zygomatic arch, and sometimes extends as far down as the jaw. Second, the stripe between the eyes is occasionally bulb-shaped, compared to the rectangular stripe seen in the neighboring species. Also, a light band of fur in front of the ears is usually intermediate in width compared to the narrow and wide bands seen in the other Bornean species. Compared to N. menagensis, the facemask of N. kayan has more contrast between its dark black and white features, and its ears are always covered in hair, whereas those of N. menagensis are generally naked. Overall, its fur is generally longer and fluffier compared to N. menagensis. Based on a limited number of specimens, the species is about long, and weighs about . Distribution N. kayan is found in central and northern Borneo. Its range extends south to the Mahakam and Rajang Rivers in the Indonesian province of East Kalimantan and the Malaysian province of Sarawak, respectively, and north to southern side of Mount Kinabalu in the Malaysian province of Sabah. Although it is not found along the coast, its range spans Borneo from east to west. Its range overlaps that of N. menagensis in East Kalimantan and Sabah, and N. borneanus is a neighboring species. Habitat and ecology Like other slow lorises, N. kayan is arboreal, nocturnal, and omnivorous, eating primarily insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit. Likewise, this species has a toxic bite, a unique feature found only in slow lorises among primates. The toxin is produced by licking a brachial gland (a gland by its elbow), and the secretion mixes with its saliva to activate. The toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for infants. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite the aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wound. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. The face mask may help the species identify potential mates by distinguishing species, and may serve as an anti-predator strategy by making its eyes appear larger than they really are. Conservation While Nycticebus kayan has yet to be assessed by the IUCN, N. menagensis was listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" as of 2012. Because that species has been divided into four distinct species, each of the new species faces a higher risk of extinction. Accordingly, each of them are expected to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" at least, with some of them likely to be assigned to a higher-risk category. Between 1987 and 2012, one- third of Borneo's forests were lost, making habitat loss one of the greatest threats to the survival of N. kayan. The illegal wildlife trade is also a major factor, with loris parts commonly sold for traditional medicine. Further, viral videos on YouTube promote the exotic pet trade. However, all slow loris species are protected from commercial trade under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The cemetery is the burial place for thousands of mainly American veterans and Filipino Scouts who served in the United States Army, and who died in conflicts other than World War II or on military bases in the Philippines. History The origins of the Clark Veterans Cemetery can be traced to 1900 after the conclusion of the Spanish–American War. As a result of the war, the United States acquired the Philippines from Spain and established a number of US Army posts throughout the islands. These included a large Army base in Manila named Fort William McKinley and an even larger US Cavalry base 50 miles north of Manila called Fort Stotsenburg (now Clark). Similarly the US Navy, after Rear Admiral George Dewey defeated the Spanish Navy in the Battle of Manila Bay, created naval bases including one at Sangley Point in Cavite. Many of these military installations had post cemeteries. The largest was the cemetery at Fort William McKinley in Manila. During World War II, the Fort McKinley military post cemetery was the scene of heavy fighting because it was strategically situated on a hill that overlooked the city and Manila Bay. During the battle to liberate Manila in early 1945, thousands of graves and cemetery records were lost or damaged, including a large marble obelisk Monument to the Unknown Dead. Remains moved to Clark After World War II, in 1946, the US and Philippine governments determined that this site would be the best location for a new cemetery and memorial to honor those who died throughout Southeast Asia during World War II. However, in order to accommodate as many as 17,000 World War II remains, the US Government had to find a new home for the thousands of non-World War II dead already buried there. That new home was to be at Fort Stotsenburg (now Clark). From January to May 1948, all the non-World War II dead at the Fort McKinley cemetery were disinterred and relocated to the newly created military post cemetery at Fort Stotsenburg, which became known as the Clark Veterans Cemetery. Three other older US military post cemeteries were also moved and relocated to this new consolidated non World War II military post cemetery at Fort Stotsenburg. These three cemeteries were the US Navy Sangley Point Military Cemetery and two smaller and older military cemeteries that had previously existed at Fort Stotsenburg called Stotsenburg I and II. Later, in 1949, Fort Stotsenburg itself was transferred from the U.S. Army to the United States Air Force and renamed Clark Air Force Base. This is the site of the Clark Veterans Cemetery. The Clark Veterans Cemetery is located just inside the main gate of the former base and consists of with room for 12,000 plots. Work began on preparation of the new site in 1947 with the first batch of graves used for burial of remains arriving from Fort McKinley in January 1948. By December 1950 all of the non- World War II dead from Fort McKinley, Sangley Point and Stotsenburg I and II were consolidated in the new Clark Veterans Cemetery, with 5,056 remains having been relocated. This then enabled construction of the new Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in Taguig City for the burial of the World War II dead. Mount Pinatubo damage and restoration efforts The 1991 volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Pinatubo spewed volcanic ash for miles and covered everything with to of ash. Later a soft weedy and spongy surface where vegetation grew on top of the ash and an undulating ground surface created when the ash was removed from the flat horizontal stones which now often becomes covered with debris can also be seen. The ash damage is most evident with the lower half of all vertical epitaphs totally hidden from view. In 1994, veterans from Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 2485 stepped forward to help halt the decay. After 3 years of neglect, members of the Post volunteered to remove overgrown vegetation and removing ash. Since then, VFW Post 2485 members have administered and maintained the cemetery in a ‘state of arrested decay’. A not for profit organization, the Clark Veterans Restoration Association, was created to promote the cemetery's history, to educate the public and advocate for the US Government to reassume its responsibility to administer the cemetery.History of the Cemetery'Additional information on the cemetery may be found at the VFW cemetery page and Clark Veterans Cemetery Restoration Association (CVCRA) page. In 2011, an American small business, Peregrine Development International, operating at Clark in conjunction with the Kuwaiti sponsored Global Gateway Logistics City Project, collaborated with the VFW Post 2485 to donate and construct a new perimeter fence and gate. Present status Today, the Clark Veterans Cemetery contains the remains of almost 8,600 individuals with the earliest recorded burial being Private Santiago Belona, a Philippine Scout who served in the US Army and died on January 13, 1900. While there are no remaining records, it is believed he was moved from one of the two old Fort Stotsenburg post cemeteries. In addition to the 650 Philippine Scouts, there are thousands of U.S. veterans from the US Army, US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Air Force and US Coast Guard and their dependents, which comprise the preponderance of the burials. There are veterans interred at Clark who served in every American conflict since the Spanish–American War, including the Philippine–American War, World War I, World War II (survivors who died after the war), the Korean War, Vietnam War and Iraq War. There are also over 2,100 unknowns buried at Clark. While the majority of all burials are American veterans, Philippine Scouts and their dependents, there are some exceptions authorized by the US Government for burial. For example, there are several hundred civilians who served in the US Army Quartermaster Department as teamsters, farriers, wheelwrights, blacksmiths and packers with the majority of these having served in the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War. They died in the early 1900s when the Army relied solely on civilians to drive the wagons and tend the horses. A female civilian trumpeter who was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Regiment (United States) who died in 1916, and civilian Ordnance Specialists and the Chief Engineer of a US revenue cutter, a customs vessel, who died in 1906, are buried at the cemetery. There are a few foreign nationals buried in the cemetery. All such burials are directly approved and authorized by the US Government. These persons died on the various military posts and include nine Vietnamese who were among the 30,082 boat people/refugees repatriated by the US Government in 1975 and processed through the Clark Air Force Base processing center and one French Navy Commander who died in 1905 and one Third Class Petty Officer of Chinese descent who was serving in the Royal Canadian Navy and died in 1956. From the cemetery’s initial inception and existence on the various military posts from as early as 1900, through the consolidation and moves to Fort Stotsenburg in 1948, the cemeteries had been solely administered by the US Army and US Navy. In 1949 when the US Air Force assumed responsibility for Fort Stotsenburg and it was officially renamed Clark Field, the US Air Force assumed sole responsibility for managing the Clark cemetery. This was attested by the Commander, United States 13th Air Force when on July 4, 1984 he dedicated a memorial to the \\"last active USAF Cemetery outside the United States.\\" By special agreement with the Philippine Government, the cemetery remains open for burials of American Veterans and Philippine Scouts. The VFW Post provides full military honors. There are an average of 40 burials a year, exclusively veterans, including many World War II and Vietnam era warriors. In 2004, a young soldier serving in Iraq was killed in an IED incident and is buried in the cemetery. He was the first Iraq War fatality to be interred in Clark Veterans Cemetery. There are several monuments and commemorative memorials in the cemetery. The largest is a six and a half foot obelisk marble Monument to Unknown Dead. This monument was constructed of Vermont marble imported in 1907 and erected in the Fort McKinley cemetery and dedicated in 1908 by the Ladies Memorial Association of Manila. The monument was damaged during the fighting to liberate Manila in 1945 and later moved to the new Clark cemetery site in May 1948. A second smaller stone monument was dedicated on July 4, 1984 by the Commander of 13th Air Force honoring the cemetery at Clark as \\"The last USAF cemetery outside the continental United States\\". A third monument exists adjacent to the main entrance of the cemetery. It is a Bataan Death March monument dedicated to fellow Elks, both American and Filipino, who passed within of the cemetery on the Death March trains that carried them from the City of San Fernando in Pampanga to Capas in Tarlac and on to their final imprisonment at the Imperial Japanese Camp O'Donnell prisoner of war facility. In January 2013, the United States authorized $5 million to restore the cemetery, and placed the cemetery under the American Battle Monuments Commission, who will assume responsibility for cemetery maintenance. In February 2013, retired U.S. Navy Captain Dennis Wright said that an agreement still needs to be made between the United States and the Philippines in order for it to operate the cemetery which is seen as being a tourist attraction by the Clark Development Corporation. In December 2013 it was announced that Clark Cemetery would be taken over by the American Battle Monuments CommissionClark Veterans Cemetery News December 13, 2013 Following the resumption of American maintenance of the cemetery, there was a dispute between the American and Philippine governments about who shall be authorized to buried at the cemetery in the future. In December 2016, it was recommended that the cemetery name be changed to \\"Clark American Cemetery\\" and that it be negotiated with the Philippine government that the operation of the cemetery be changed to \\"in perpetuity\\". By 2019, restoration of the cemetery, at the cost of several million dollars, was completed. Increasingly, the cemetery has become surrounded by Chinese-led new developments.

Originally considered a subspecies or synonym of the Bornean slow loris (N. menagensis), it was promoted to full species status in 2013 when a study of museum specimens and photographs identified distinct facial markings, which helped to differentiate it as a separate species. It is distinguished by the crimson red fur on its back, light-colored facial features, as well as the shape and width of the stripes of its facial markings. As with other slow lorises, this arboreal and nocturnal species primarily eats insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit and has a toxic bite, a unique feature among primates. Although not yet evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it is likely to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" or placed in a higher-risk category when its conservation status is assessed. It is primarily threatened by habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade. Taxonomy and phylogeny N. bancanus is a strepsirrhine primate, and species of slow loris (genus Nycticebus) within the family Lorisidae. Museum specimens of this animal had previously been identified as the Bornean slow loris (Nycticebus menagensis), first described by the English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1893 as Lemur menagensis. In 1906, Marcus Ward Lyon, Jr. first described N. bancanus, noting that it was a \\"well-marked offshoot of N. borneanus, which he also first described in the same publication. By 1953, all of the slow lorises were lumped together into a single species, the Sunda slow loris (Nycticebus coucang). In 1971, that view was updated by distinguishing the pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) as a species, and by further recognizing four subspecies, including N. coucang menagensis, the Bornean slow loris. From then until 2005, N. bancanus was considered a synonym of the Bornean slow loris, which was elevated to the species level (as N. menagensis) in 2006, when molecular analysis showed it to be genetically distinct from N. coucang. A 2013 review of museum specimens and photographs attributed to N. menagensis resulted in elevating two of its former subspecies to the species N. bancanus and N. borneanus. Additionally, N. kayan emerged as a new species, which had previously been overlooked. All newly recognized or elevated species showed significant differences in their \\"face mask\\"—the coloration patterns on their face. Physical description Like other slow lorises, it has a vestigial tail, round head, and short ears. It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes. Like N. menagensis, this and all other Bornean species lack a second upper incisor, which distinguishes them from other slow lorises. On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved grooming claw that it uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight. It also possesses a specialized arrangement of lower front teeth, called a toothcomb, which is also used for grooming, as with other lemuriform primates. On the ventral side of its elbow, it has a small swelling called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. N. bancanus has distinct crimson red fur on its back, the facial markings (facemask) are light in color, and the upper edges of the dark rings around the eyes (circumocular patch) are diffuse, and not rounded or pointed like some of the other slow lorises from Borneo. The circumocular patch does not extend below the zygomatic arch, and the stripe between its eyes is wide. The colored patched on the top of the head is diffused, the band of hair in front of the ears is narrow, and the ears are covered in hair. The body length averages . Distribution N. bancanus is found in southwestern Borneo, in the Indonesian provinces of West and South Kalimantan, as well as the island of Bangka. On Borneo, its range extends south of the Kapuas River and east towards—but not reaching—the Barito River. The Bangka population is allopatric with the other Bornean species, but the population on Borneo may exhibit some sympatry with N. borneanus in the province of West Kalimantan. Habitat and ecology Like other slow lorises, N. bancanus is arboreal, nocturnal, and omnivorous, eating primarily insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit. Likewise, this species has a toxic bite, a unique feature found only in slow lorises among primates. The toxin is produced by licking a brachial gland (a gland by their elbow), and the secretion mixes with its saliva to activate. Their toxic bite is a deterrent to predators, and the toxin is also applied to the fur during grooming as a form of protection for their infants. When threatened, slow lorises may also lick their brachial glands and bite their aggressors, delivering the toxin into the wounds. Slow lorises can be reluctant to release their bite, which is likely to maximize the transfer of toxins. The face mask may help the species identify potential mates by distinguishing species, and may serve as an anti-predator strategy by making its eyes appear larger than they really are. Conservation While this new species has yet to be assessed by the IUCN, N. menagensis was listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" as of 2012. Because that species has been divided into four distinct species, each of the new species faces a higher risk of extinction. Accordingly, each of them are expected to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" at the least, with some of them likely to be assigned to a higher-risk category. Between 1987 and 2012, one-third of Borneo's forests have been lost, making habitat loss one of the greatest threats to the survival of N. bancanus. The illegal wildlife trade is also a major factor, with loris parts commonly sold in traditional medicine and viral videos on YouTube promoting the exotic pet trade. However, all slow loris species are protected from commercial trade under Appendix I of CITES.

Formerly considered a subspecies or synonym of N. menagensis, it was promoted to full species status in 2013 when a study of museum specimens and photographs identified distinct facial markings, which helped to differentiate it as a separate species. It is distinguished by its dark, contrasting facial features, as well as the shape and width of the stripes of its facial markings. As with other slow lorises, this arboreal and nocturnal species primarily eats insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit and has a toxic bite, a unique feature among primates. Although not yet evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), it is likely to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" or placed in a higher-risk category when its conservation status is assessed. It is primarily threatened by habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade. Taxonomy and phylogeny N. borneanus is a strepsirrhine primate, and species of slow loris (genus Nycticebus) within the family Lorisidae. Museum specimens of this animal had previously been identified as the Bornean slow loris using the scientific name Nycticebus menagensis – first described by the English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1893 as Lemur menagensis, – a scientific name now assigned exclusively to the Philippine slow loris. In 1906, Marcus Ward Lyon, Jr. first described N. borneanus from western Borneo. By 1953, all of the slow lorises were lumped together into a single species, the Sunda slow loris (Nycticebus coucang). In 1971, that view was updated by distinguishing the pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) as a species, and by further recognizing four subspecies, including N. coucang menagensis. From then until 2005, N. borneanus was considered a synonym of N. menagensis. The latter was elevated to the species level in 2006, when molecular analysis showed it to be genetically distinct from N. coucang. A 2013 review of museum specimens and photographs attributed to N. menagensis resulted in elevating two of its former subspecies to species: N. bancanus and N. borneanus. Additionally, N. kayan emerged as a new species, which had previously been overlooked. All newly recognized or elevated species showed significant differences in their \\"face mask\\"—the coloration patterns on their face. Physical description Female, from Nanga Tayap, Ketapang Regency Like other slow lorises, it has a vestigial tail, round head, and short ears. It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes. Like N. menagensis, this and all other Bornean species lack a second upper incisor, which distinguishes them from other slow lorises. On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved grooming claw that it uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight. It also possesses a specialized arrangement of lower front teeth, called a toothcomb, which is also used for grooming, as with other lemuriform primates. On the ventral side of its elbow, it has a small swelling called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The facial markings of N. borneanus are dark and contrasting. The dark rings around its eyes are usually rounded on top, though sometimes diffuse-edged, and they never reach below the zygomatic arch. The stripe between the eyes often varies in width, the ears are covered in hair, and the band of hair in front of the ears is wide. The colored patch on the top of the head is usually round, but is sometimes a narrower band. The body length averages for the species. Distribution N. borneanus is found in central south Borneo, in the Indonesian provinces of West, South, and Central Kalimantan. Its range extends south of the Kapuas River and east to the Barito River. However, N. borneanus is not found in the extreme southwest of the island. It may be sympatric with N. bancanus in the province of West Kalimantan. Habitat and ecology Like other slow lorises, N. borneanus is arboreal, nocturnal, and omnivorous, eating primarily insects, tree gum, nectar, and fruit. Likewise, this species has a toxic bite, a unique feature found only in slow lorises among primates. The toxin is produced by licking a brachial gland (a gland by their elbow), and the secretion mixes with its saliva to activate.

It was established by historian Raphael Samuel in 1958 in the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and the Soviet invasion of Hungary. It closed in 1962, victim of a \\"business model\\" that was hospitable to the penniless intellectuals who patronised it, but wholly unrealistic. The building is now utilised as office space. Foundation The group that founded the Partisan initially came together in Oxford, as editors and contributors of the Universities & Left Review magazine (ULR) before it merged with The New Reasoner to form New Left Review.Universities & Left Review magazine. In addition to Raphael Samuel, the group included the late Stuart Hall and Eric Hobsbawm. Funds to buy the Carlisle Street property were raised by soliciting donations and loans from political sympathisers. The Partisan was initially intended to raise funds for the ULR, and it was partly conceived as an alternative to the Italian-style coffee bars which had mushroomed in London in the 1950s. Major investors included: * Michael Redgrave, actor * Ken Tynan, theatre critic * John Calder, publisher * Lewis Casson, actor and producer * Wolf Mankowitz, screenwriter * Naomi Mitchison, novelist * Doris Lessing, author Layout The main coffee house, where food was served, was on the ground floor. Tables, mostly communal, were at the back of the building. At the front a few armchairs were provided. The business failure of the venture was largely attributable to its firm policy of allowing patrons to occupy tables indefinitely without ordering anything. The basement was furnished with more tables, and chess sets were available. Talks, poetry readings, film screenings and informal concerts were a fairly frequent feature of the basement area.BBC Radio 4 documentary by historian Mike Berlin, 4 December 2008 20:00-20:30 The coffee house was open from 10:30 to midnight daily. Above the coffee house were the library, and the private offices of the ULR. Food and drink For most of its life, the Partisan sold cappuccino and croissants for 9d each. Food served included farmhouse soup, borscht, mutton stew, liver dumplings and Whitechapel cheesecake. The menus and some posters were designed by graphic designer Desmond Jeffery. No alcoholic drinks were served, but they were readily available at any of several nearby pubs, notably The Highlander (now the Nellie Dean) just a few steps away on the corner of Dean Street. Patronage The Partisan attracted students, intellectuals, writers, musicians, actors and other theatrical types, all having left-wing sympathies. Among the clientele who were, or became, celebrities were: * Doris Lessing, author * Marghanita Laski, journalist * Karel Reisz, film director * Lindsay Anderson, theatre and film director * Arnold Wesker, playwright, and the Centre 42 activists * Peggy Seeger, folk singer * Raymond Williams, novelist and critic * Derek Marlowe, novelist and screenwriter * Quentin Crisp, \\"The Naked Civil Servant\\" * John Hurt, actor who famously portrayed Crisp in a 1975 made-for television film * John Malcolm, actor * John Berger, art critic and author * Richard Hoggart, author and sociologist * Christopher Logue, poet and pacifist * Rod Stewart, entertainer It was also visited by Special Branch officers who monitored conversations there. The early Aldermaston Marches (1958–60) were partly planned in the basement of the Partisan, and the membership of the Committee of 100 was also drawn up at the coffee house. The coffee house was the subject of an edition of the BBC television current affairs series Panorama, presented by Christopher Chataway. In 2017 the Four Corners Gallery in Bethnal Green, London held an exhibition of memorabilia, documents and film of the cafe.

He left New Orleans in 1816 after having been raised for a time by an aunt, and began working in the lower-Missouri fur trade in 1819. He later became involved in the Missouri Fur Company. He married Bright Sun, also known as Me- um-bane, a daughter of the Omaha Chief Big Elk. Among their children was Logan Fontenelle. Early in his career Fontenelle was involved in fur trading into the Rocky Mountains. However starting in the late 1820s he was in command at Fontenelle's Post in what would become Bellevue, Nebraska, along the Missouri River. In 1831 he led a trading expedition to the Cache Valley of Utah and Idaho with Andrew Drips.

A natural lake at this spot had only a south outlet. In the early 20th century, the lake was enlarged and its flow altered by a high dam near the south end of the lake. The dam's purpose was to store additional water and to deflect it north for irrigation of farms in the Lostine Valley. It is said that minam is a word that evolved in the mid-19th century from the native word e-mi-ne-mah.

It started operation on 30 December 2015. The 344-km long rail line runs along the western half of the island's coastline, from Haikou Railway Station in the north to Sanya Railway Station. At its two end points, it connects with the existing Hainan eastern ring high-speed railway (opened in 2010), thus forming a high-speed railway ring around the entire island. Unlike the Hainan eastern ring high- speed railway, which runs along the coast previously not served by railway (other than at its end points, Haikou and Sanya), the Western Ring Railway roughly parallels the \\"conventional\\" Hainan Western Ring Railway, which has connected Haikou and Sanya since 2005. History The Hainan western ring railway has been constructed in two stages. The first short section connects the existing Sanya Railway Station with the new Sanya Phoenix Airport Railway Station, to the west. The section has one intermediate station, the Sanya West Railway Station (). The construction work on this section () was completed by the end of 2014, but that apparently did not happen. On the rest of the railway - the much longer section from Sanya Phoenix Airport to Haikou - progress as of 2012 was still in its preliminary phase. Property was acquired, and demolition was conducted. According to the construction plans, 22,300 mu () of land will be permanently used by the railway and associated facilities, and another 8,800 mu () was temporary used during construction.

It belongs to a class of compounds known as manganates in which the manganese resides in a +6 oxidation state. Manganate should not to be confused with permanganate in which contains manganese(VII). Barium manganate is a powerful oxidant, popular in organic synthesis and can be used in a wide variety of oxidation reactions. Properties The manganate(VI) ion is a d1 ion and is tetrahedral with bond angles of approximately 109.5°. The Mn-O bond lengths in BaMnO4 and K2MnO4 are identical at 1.66 Å. In comparison, the Mn-O bond length in MnO4 2- is longer than in MnO4− of 1.56 Å and shorter than the Mn-O bond found in MnO2, 1.89 Å.Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1984).

The series follows \\"Lebanon Levi\\", along with three of his assistants, who are purported to be a \\"mafia\\" in an Amish community. Although portrayed by Discovery Channel as documentary \\"reality\\" television, the authenticity of the series has been refuted by scholars, local newspapers, and law-enforcement. The supposed secret organization within the Amish is known to be an entirely fictional creation for entertainment purposes only. There have also been accusations of the series being bigoted toward and defaming the Amish people. Storyline The series follows members of the \\"Amish Mafia\\" in their efforts to keep the peace within the Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and protect it from outsiders (usually referred to as the \\"English\\"), as they deal with internal struggles for power as to who will lead the Mafia. Cast * Lebanon Levi: \\"Lebanon\\" is the nickname of Levi King Stoltzfus. Levi is the powerful boss of the Lancaster Amish Aid syndicate, which provides protection and relief to the largest Amish community in America. Having staved off power grabs from fierce rivals, Levi walked away from the \\"English world\\" and spurned the cameras from his organization in an attempt to avoid the limelight. Levi has been arrested three times between 2000 and 2007 for drunk driving and drunk and disorderly conduct. He is also a member of the local volunteer fire department. Throughout the series, Levi mentions that he was never officially baptized into the Amish church. * Alvin: Alvin Stoltzfus Lantz is Levi's \\"main assistant\\", who is soft-spoken but has a loud personality. He has an arrest record for drunk and disorderly conduct and fleeing police to avoid arrest where he was put on probation for six months and paid a $500 fine. * Jolin: Jolin Zimmerman is a loyal member of Levi's crew who is portrayed as a Mennonite, and he can therefore accomplish certain tasks that the crew cannot, due to the restrictions by which Amish people must abide. He has a criminal record for marijuana possession, hit-and-run, and disorderly conduct. * John: John Freeman Schmucker is Esther's brother and a former member of Levi's group. He is mischievous and the son of the former leader of the alleged Amish mafia. He has a criminal record for five counts of driving under suspension and a misdemeanor hit-and-run since 2008. * Esther: Esther Freeman Schmucker, knows Levi sees her as more than a friend, and she uses this knowledge to lead Levi on, to the benefit of her brother, John. She has an arrest record for two disorderly conducts. * Wayne: Merlin's former enforcer. * Alan: Alan Beiler is known as \\"Schwarze Amish\\" or black Amish. * Caleb: Caleb is a member Levi's crew and is a from a Brethren community. * Freeman: Freeman Schmucker is Esther and John's brother and is rumored to be possessed by the devil. * Crazy Dave: Dave is a member of Levi's crew. * Big Steve: Steve is an associate of Levi's. Episodes Series overview Season 1 (2012-13) 2013 specials Season 2 (2013) 2013 Christmas special Season 3 (2014) Season 4 (2015) Authenticity and criticism The veracity of the events depicted on the series has been widely questioned, with The New York Times noting that \\"An early credit warns of 'select re-enactments', and since we're never later told whether we're watching staged scenes, it's fairly safe to assume that everything is staged.\\" Additionally, \\"A closing credit clarifies that 're- creations are based on eyewitness accounts, testimonials and the legend of the Amish Mafia'.\\" It is not publicly known which scenes are based on accounts and testimonials and which are based on legend. The series has been strongly criticized by scholars of the Amish. Donald Kraybill, an Elizabethtown College professor and prominent researcher of and author about the Anabaptist lifestyle, commented about Levi allegedly being an unbaptized Amish: \\"Baptism is essential in the Amish faith: Either you're in or you're out.\\" Also, Kraybill and others observed that genuine Amish people wouldn't appear on camera, as their faith forbids it. Such criticisms include: \\"To call these shows documentaries is a fraudulent lie,\\" and \\"[the show] is just sort of an example of the foolishness and stupidity and lies—misrepresentations I should say—that are promoted [about the Amish] in television...These production crews should be ashamed of trying to say that represents Amish life.\\" These views are echoed by Donald Weaver-Zercher, Messiah College Professor and authority on the Amish, who stated that upon initially seeing the trailer for the show, \\"I thought maybe it was a Saturday Night Live skit on reality television because it was so far fetched\\". \\"My sense is this Amish mafia is about as real as the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in The Office.\\" Several sources agreed that the Amish themselves are unlikely to respond about the show's credibility because they value their privacy and usually do not interact with the media. Jeffrey Conrad, a former prosecutor in Lancaster County, stated that his office was not aware of an \\"Amish mafia\\", and if there were they would have been prosecuted. Several factual errors have been highlighted by local press: during one episode the narrator states that Lebanon Levi was arrested by the Lancaster County Police, which does not exist. There is a Lancaster City Bureau of Police, but no county-wide force. The owners of one store portrayed as paying protection money to Lebanon Levi have denied having any relationship with him. A scene purported to be shot in the \\"heart\\" of Amish country – south-central Lancaster County – turned out to have been shot in a riverside park in Columbia on the county's western edge. Lebanon Levi often states that he earned the money to pay for his luxury car through his construction business. The vehicle however, has markings and stickers on it that would indicate that it is an Enterprise rental car. The series has been controversial both locally and in the US media as a result of its alleged bigoted and inaccurate portrayal of the Amish. Churches and Lancaster County residents have banded together in opposing the show. Additionally, former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett called for the show's cancellation and said it was \\"bigoted\\" and \\"an affront to all people of faith and all secular people with moral principles\\".

Followers of the religion, known as Mumboites, were most active in the Nyanza region of Kenya near Lake Victoria. The movement had anti-imperial teachings and was suppressed by the colonial government of Kenya. Origins Mumboism began during the British colonial era in Kenya, when Christian missionaries were active in the region. In 1913, Onyango Dunde began to preach that he had been swallowed by a serpent in Lake Victoria. The serpent spit him out, and gave him a prophecy that he would spread to his followers: > I am the God Mumbo whose two homes are in the sun and in the lake. I have > chosen you to be my mouthpiece. Go and tell all the Africans.... that from > henceforth I am their God. Those whom I choose personally and those who > acknowledge me, will live forever in plenty.... the Christian religion is > rotten.... All Europeans are your enemies, but the time is shortly coming > when they will all disappear from the country.\\"George F. Pickens, African > Christian God-Talk: Matthew Ajuoga's Johera Narrative. University Press of > America, 2004; pp. 133-134. Quoted in Oeching (1992, 1997). History In keeping with the prophecy, Dunde condemned European culture, Christianity, and the influence of colonialism. He also prophesied a golden age that would arrive with the end of the European presence in the region. Mumboism was popular among the Luo and Kisii people, but its influence spread beyond Africans who were formally followers of Dunde. Mumboism's teachings have been characterized as a strain of millennialism, anticipating a golden age, perhaps influenced by Christian teachings of a cataclysmic end to the current world's existence. Some teachings were that \\"water would turn into blood, and only Mumboites would have drinking water, all white people would disappear leaving only Africans as sole survivors, or the Germans would come and cut off the arms of those in clothes (i.e., Europeans and Westernized Africans). [...] The projected utopia would be a time of role reversal, healing, and plenty that could only be effected by traditional sacrifices and rituals\\". In the years following the end of World War I, many of the Kisii (AbaGusii) became followers of Mumboism in growing numbers. Some factors contributing to this were frustration with the colonial government due to deteriorating agricultural, trade and health conditions among the Kisii people, fluctuating currency value, and the colonial administration's increasingly burdensome demands concerning taxation, labour owed to the colonial government, and requirements for registration. The golden age prophecy of an end to European government appealed to the Kisii, who had openly revolted against the colonial administration in 1905, 1908 and 1914, only to be defeated by the Europeans. Its appeal among the Kisii people was small during times of prosperity, when meeting the colonial administration's demands was easier. During times of economic hardship, its religious and political appeal grew among the Kisii. The Bogonko clan, the wealthiest and most influential among the Kisii, were adherents of Mumboism. Their position had been undermined by the European presence, and they were leaders of Mumboism particularly among the Kitutu subclan.Godwin R. Murunga and W. Nasong'o Shadrack, Kenya: The Struggle for Democracy. Zed Books, 2007; pg. 64. . Suppression The colonial administration was threatened by the anti- European message of Mumboism. The colonial government ultimately banned Mumboism in 1954. Much earlier in 1921, it had exiled Dunde and other Mumbo leaders to the holy Islamic island of Lamu in the Indian Ocean. A 1919 government report had listed important leaders of the movement, some of whom were openly opposed to the colonial government: Mosi Auma of Kabondo, Nyakundi of Kitutu, Omwenga of Wanjare. The colonial administration had a tendency to conflate Mumboism with other indigenous religious beliefs, such as the cult around the late prophet Sakawa (Zakawa), who it was said had prophesied European rule, the building of the railroad and the site of Kisii. Mumboism was not the sole religious movement in Central or Eastern Africa to reflect anti-European sentiment. The Kamba people around Machakos, Kenya, had a millennial cult that developed in the interwar years around the prophet Ndonye wa Kauti, which had parallels with Mumboism. Dini ya Msambwa or Nsambwa (DYM), \\"religion of the ancestral spirits\\", was another rejection of Christianity that developed during the early 20th century in Kenya. It was founded by Elijah Masinde, among the Babukusu.Murunga and Shadrack, Kenya, pp. 64-65. Yet another new religious movement was the Karing'a movement, influenced by Agikuyu religious ideal concepts similar to democracy.Murunga and Shadrack, Kenya, pg. 66.

He primarily performed with the Los Angeles Lakers and was a staple of their Showtime era. Richards made his Dancing Barry debut for the Houston Rockets in 1975, and he performed in Houston for a few years. Starting in 1983, he was a paid performer for the Lakers for seven full seasons. He later performed for the Charlotte Hornets for five seasons as Magic Barry, a name he also uses for his entertainment company, corporate game shows and magic act. Early start Richards graduated from the University of Houston. He first danced at a Houston Rockets game in the 1975 NBA Playoffs. Richards had recently graduated from a Fred Astaire dance studio, where he received a deal for five lessons for $5. The Rockets' opponent was the New York Knicks, whose home games at Madison Square Garden featured Dancing Harry placing a whammy on the opposing team. Richards' friends encouraged him to be Harry's counterpart. In the first game of the series, the Knicks were being routed in the fourth quarter and called timeout; the band started to play. Avoiding security guards, Richards put on a swing-dance spin move and continued dancing and avoiding security through the entire song. After the song ended, he ripped open his shirt to display \\"DANCING BARRY\\" where Superman wears his \\"S\\". Dancing Barry became a mainstay at Houston Rockets games for the next four seasons. Los Angeles career The Forum. Two years later, in 1982, Richards moved to Los Angeles and became a real estate mortgage broker, as well as a part-time magician. A friend, who believed the Los Angeles Lakers's home crowd at The Forum was \\"laid back\\", convinced Richards to revive his Dancing Barry routine. On March 20, 1983, the Lakers called a timeout in the fourth quarter after a 17-point lead over the Dallas Mavericks had been reduced to one point. The band was playing \\"When the Saints Go Marching In\\", when Richards got up and danced. Lakers announcer Chick Hearn took notice of his performance, and the Lakers scored eight points in a row and won the game, 117–110. Dancing Barry sometimes performed with then-Laker Girl Paula Abdul. For the following seven- plus seasons, Dancing Barry was a regular at Lakers games, always performing during the fourth quarter. He was a staple of their Showtime Era, and his tenure with the team included six NBA Finals appearances and championships in 1985, 1987 and 1988 for the Lakers. He no longer had to pay for tickets, and he was paid $35 a game during his first season with the Lakers, the same rate as the Laker Girls were paid. When the Los Angeles Clippers offered to pay him $200 a game, the Lakers matched the offer. He was perturbed that he never received another raise. Although he came up with new comedy dance routines that required people to help, Dancing Barry had to pay them out of his own pocket. Dancing Barry usually performed wearing stylized sunglasses, and wore either an all-white or custom-made purple-and-gold tuxedo. Barry's high-level energy frequently worked a quiet Forum crowd into a frenzy. During some broadcasts, Chick Hearn credited him with firing up the crowd and the Lakers. Barry sometimes joined then-Laker Girl Paula Abdul in an on-court skit. Dancing Barry performed again in Houston in a 1986 Finals game between the Rockets and the Boston Celtics, where he said he was accosted by a fan who called him a \\"traitor\\". Barry recalled his last appearance for the Lakers being a 15-point victory against the Chicago Bulls in January 1990. The games grew less fun for him, and he simply stopped going. Barry left with a bitter taste in his mouth, as the Lakers never said goodbye to him or thanked him for seven seasons of great memories for the fans. In 2007, he refused an invitation to attend a 20-year reunion of the Lakers 1987 championship when the Lakers denied his request for $2,000 and an airplane ticket, even though he would have had to fly across the country. Later years Richards married and moved to Charlotte, North Carolina. He became a territorial sales representative and trainer for a veterinary laboratory, selling lab services and training vets on promoting their business. On the side he performed as Magic Barry, producing corporate game shows and performing close-up magic at both corporate and family events. He also danced at Charlotte Hornets games for five years, performing his Lakers' act under the name Magic Barry, before the team moved to New Orleans.

In 2000 he was awarded the S.E.A. Write Award for his novel อมตะ (Amata, or Immortal). Wimon Sainimnuan was born near Phra Pin Klao Bridge on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya River. His parents moved to Nakhon Pathom province two years later to grow rice; here he was exposed to a \\"traditional rural environment,\\" which would inform much of his later writing, especially in terms of religious beliefs. At age 11, his parents moved the family back to \\"a tiny room in a wooden shack in the Huay Khuang slum.\\" His father delivered coal and gambled; his mother made desserts for a street merchant. Around age 12, he began to suffer from migraines and ulcers. This period of Wimon's life was described in his 1987 novel, คนจน (Khon Chon, The Poor). In 1975, at age seventeen, he published his first short story.Based on Barang's given date of birth. Around the same time, he began three years of training at teacher colleges in Bangkok and Ayutthaya. He became a teacher and married a woman named Arunee, also a teacher. He started his career in Nakhon Pathom, but transferred to Ayutthaya after three years because of differences with the administration. In 1982,All sources agree on this date. he published his first novel, แมงมุมอ้วน (Maengmum Ouan, The Fat Spider), a novel for children. That same year, he entered Srinakharinwirot University. In 1983, Wimon's first collection of short stories appeared. Around the same time, using borrowed money, he started his own printing press, Tharntawan,. Barang does not make it clear if Tharntawan (or Thantawan), the press Wimon owned in 1994, is the same press he started in 1983 or not. \\"2000 S.E.A. Write Award\\" contradicts this, saying instead that Wimon was n editor for the press and an associate editor for Ton Or Publishing House (32) to print translations that he commissioned from friends. In 1984, at age 26 he wrote in just 26 days his breakout novel, งู (Ngu, Snakes). งู, reportedly inspired by The Grapes of Wrath, \\"denounces the evil of power seekers hiding in monks' robes and the connivance between monks and politicians.\\" He would continue as a teacher for a few more years before leaving to write full-time. Other novels include คนทรงเจ้า (Khon Songchao, The Medium, 1988, which was made into a film), โคกพระนาง (Khok Phranang, The Princess Mound, 1989), and จ้าวแผ่นดิน (Chawphaendin, Lord of the Earth, 1996), which form a series with Snakes, and Amata (2000). Many of his books explore Buddhist themes and the dichotomy of an individual's will versus societal forces. Amata, for example, involves a wealthy businessman who has himself cloned with the intention of using the clones as organ donors. The plot revolves around the eventual transplantation of the businessman's brain into his clone's younger body. Since in Buddhism the heart is where the \\"mind\\" lives, the clone's mind can take control of the businessman's brain, thus freeing him from the older man's rule when the now unused body is committed to cryogenic storage. Wimon's works are populated by \\"bogus and genuine monks,\\" murderers, kidnappers, rapists (and other sexual taboos), and good guys who are still \\"violent, ill-tempered, and foul-mouthed,\\" and touch on themes that include the exploitation of farmers, women's liberation, the education system, and political problems of all kinds. Although some of his characters are \\"excessively black-and-white,\\" he writes with a righteous anger and is bent on exposing fraud and \\"human failings.\\"  References  Bibliography * * Wimon Sainimnuan Category:Living people Category:S.E.A.

The park occupies land known as the Social flatlands where textile mills operated along the banks of the Mill River until the early years of the 20th century. Since 1979, the park has hosted the three-day Autumnfest celebration held annually on Columbus Day Weekend. Redevelopment In 2012, the city and state governments were embroiled in a controversy over who should take responsibility for future maintenance of the park. The director of the Department of Environmental Management announced that a $2.6 million plan to refurbish the park, which had fallen into a state of disrepair, would be put on hold until a long-term agreement regarding park maintenance and staffing could be reached with the city. In 2014, the state legislature budgeted moneys for the park's redevelopment and maintenance over a five-year period beginning in 2015 with the aim of allowing \\"the state ... to turn the land over to the city so it can take charge of its maintenance.\\" The agreement ultimately reached saw the Department of Environmental Management providing an improvement grant of $2.6 million with the city making an in-kind contribution of preparation work done by the Public Works Department. Improvements under the project saw redesigned grounds with splash park, playground and outdoor activities area, basketball courts, and the new little league baseball field near Social Street. A reopening ceremony for the city-owned and -operated park was scheduled for early 2016. Activities and amenities The park offers a splash park, baseball field, basketball courts, playground, picnic tables, walking paths, performance stage, and veterans monument.

When he was nine, Pitruzzella began taking drum lessons from Brady Fishler, where he was taught to read sheet music, play jazz, rock, and all the drum rudiments. His drum lessons continued until he was 13, at which point Pitruzzella's passion for metal was born after hearing his first blast beat. On his 14th birthday, Pitruzzella received his first double bass pedal. Pitruzzella practiced for several hours every day after school, playing to his favourite death metal drummers. He was also active in his school's drumline and orchestra all throughout his schooling career.

Later that year, he also released his \\"home made\\" instructional DVD titled \\"Lord of the Blast\\". In 2009, Jeff Hughell and Pitruzzella released a drum-and-bass death metal EP, titled I Came to Hate.

Early life O'Callaghan was born on 11 April 1845 near Windsor along the Hawkesbury River in New South Wales. He was the eldest son of servant and grazier Jeremiah Callaghan and his wife Margaret (née Quinn), he attended Todd's Academy in Sydney and spent much of his childhood in Britain and North America. Back in Australia, the family established a form on the Mortnington Peninsula, before relocating to Melbourne in 1860. O'Callaghan joined the Victoria Police Force on 16 November 1887, starting off as a Detective, Third Class. Prior to joining the police, he spent some time mining for gold, in what was ultimately a luckless endeavour. Career Although O'Callaghan quickly established himself as a successful crime-buster, he was also notorious for self-destructive behaviour. For instance, in 1871, he was demoted for giving alcohol to a prisoner, and in 1882 he was suspended from duty for \\"disrespectful demeanour towards the Royal Commission on Police\\". Nevertheless, he was promoted to Officer in 1886; Inspector in 1892; Superintendent in 1895; and Chief Commissioner on 1 July 1902. O'Callaghan authored the Victorian Police Code in 1906. He retired from the police force on 31 March 1913. O'Callaghan was also an active member of the Australian Natives' Association. Having joined in 1876, he was elected as foundation chief president in 1877, serving in the position till 1878. He also edited the inaugural issue of the foundation's journal, the National Journal. O'Callaghan was the President of the Royal Historical Society of Victoria from 1925 to 1927. Later years and personal life O'Callaghan was a Catholic and a member of the Melbourne Cricket Club. On 20 June 1882, he married schoolteacher Mary McDonald at St Francis' Church in Melbourne. They had seven sons and five daughters, including three sets of twins. McDonald died in 1914 and two of their children also predeceased him. Having been in poor health for several months, O'Callaghan died on 1 September 1931 at his North Carlton residence, aged 86.

Levasseur built the aircraft in 1927, specifically for pilots Charles Nungesser and François Coli for a transatlantic attempt to win the Orteig Prize. Only two examples of the type were built, with the first PL.8-01 named L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), that gained fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft. Design and development At the Pierre Levasseur Company in Paris, Nungesser and Coli, working closely with Chief Engineer Émile Farret and production manager Albert Longelot, assisted in the design of the new Levasseur PL.8 biplane. Based on the PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional single-bay wood and fabric-covered biplane that carried a crew of two in a side-by-side open cockpit. Major modifications included the reinforcement of the plywood fuselage, removing two of the forward cockpits with the main cockpit widened to allow Nungesser and Coli to sit side-by-side. The wingspan was also increased to approximately . In adding two additional fuel tanks mounted aft of the firewall, the three fuel tanks held a total of 4,025 litres (1,056 gallons) of gasoline.McDonaugh 1966, p. 29. The PL.8 also incorporated several safety features in case of ditching at sea. Apart from small floats attached directly to the undersides of the lower wing, the main units of the fixed tailskid undercarriage could be jettisoned on takeoff in order to reduce the aircraft's weight. The underside of the fuselage was given a boat-like shape and made watertight for a water landing. Nungesser and Coli's plan was to make a water landing in New York in front of the Statue of LibertyO'Mara, Richard. \\"Surviving Amelia.\\" The Sun, 10 January 1999. A single W-12ED Lorraine-Dietrich engine was used with the cylinders set in three banks spaced 60° apart from one another, similar to the arrangement used in Napier engines. The engine was tested to ensure it would last the entire flight and was run for over 40 hours while still in the Parisian factory.Godspeed, Charles and Francois. \\"The Secret of The White Bird.\\" aero-news.net, 9 May 2006. Retrieved: 16 January 2009. The aircraft christened L'Oiseau Blanc was painted white and had the French tricolor markings, with Nungesser's personal World War I flying ace logo: a skull and crossbones, candles and a coffin, on a black heart.Wiggens, Bill. \\"Mystery of the White Bird.\\" Air Classics, July 1999. The biplane carried no radio and relied only on celestial navigation, a specialty of Coli from his previous flights around the Mediterranean. In 1928, a second PL.8 was built, equipped with a Hispano-Suiza 12M 375 kW (500 hp) engine. Flown in 1928, the PL.8-02 was intended as a long-range record breaker but modified as an air mail carrier. On 20 December 1929, the second PL.8-02, registered F-AJKP to Cie Generale Aeropostale and based at Dakar while flown by pilot Henry Delaunay, was badly damaged when it hit a pothole on landing at Istres and not repaired.\\"Project Midnight Ghost .\\" tighar.org, 2006. Retrieved: 18 January 2009. Operational history In April 1927, the first PL.8 was shipped from the factory for Nungesser to begin a series of proving tests to determine aircraft performance. Most of the flights were conducted around Villacoublay and Chartres. Although full fuel loads were never carried, during one flight, he reached a speed of and flight elevation of . Once the tests were complete, L'Oiseau Blanc was prepared for its record flight. Transatlantic flight 'L'Oiseau Blanc during the flight tests, in April 1927 L'Oiseau Blanc took off at 5:17 a.m. 8 May 1927 from Le Bourget Field in Paris, heading for New York.Berg 1999, p. 105. The biplane weighed on takeoff, extremely heavy for a single-engined aircraft. The intended flight path was a great circle route, which would have taken them across the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, across the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.Farrell, John Aloysius. \\"Unraveling the mystery of White Bird's flight.\\" Boston Globe, 8 March 1987.Will 2008, pp. 21–22. L'Oiseau Blanc had been carrying a sizable load of fuel, , which would have given them approximately 42 hours of flight time. Crowds of people gathered in New York to witness the historic arrival, with tens of thousands of people crowding Battery Park in Manhattan to have a good view of the Statue of Liberty, where the aircraft was scheduled to touch down. After their estimated time of arrival had passed, with no word as to the aircraft's fate, it was realized that the aircraft had been lost.Mosley 2000, p. 86. Rumors circulated that L'Oiseau Blanc had been sighted along its route, in Newfoundland, or over Long Island, and despite the launch of an international search, after two weeks, further search efforts were abandoned.Clayton, John. \\"The White Bird: Tracking an aviation mystery to NH.\\" New Hampshire Sunday News, 28 May 2006.Wohl 2007, p. 10.

On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion international bailout by the Eurogroup, European Commission (EC), European Central Bank (ECB) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) was announced, in return for Cyprus agreeing to close the country's second-largest bank, the Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), imposing a one-time bank deposit levy on all uninsured deposits there, and possibly around 48% of uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus (the island's largest commercial bank). A minority proportion of it held by citizens of other countries (many of whom from Russia), who preferred Cypriot banks because of their higher interest on bank account deposits, relatively low corporate tax, and easier access to the rest of the European banking sector. This resulted in numerous insinuations by US and European media, which presented Cyprus as a 'tax haven' and suggested that the prospective bailout loans were meant for saving the accounts of Russian depositors. No insured deposit of €100,000 or less would be affected, though 47.5% of all bank deposits above €100,000 were seized. Nearly one-third of Rossiya Bank's cash ($1 billion) was frozen in Cypriot accounts during this crisis. Context Cyprus's debt-to-GDP percentage compared to Eurozone average since 1999 The United States' subprime mortgage crisis in 2007–2008 led to a domino effect of negative consequences in the global economy including the European Union. The Cypriot economy went into recession in 2009, as the economy shrank by 1.67%, with large falls specifically in the tourism and shipping sectors which caused rising unemployment. Economic growth between 2010 and 2012 was weak and failed to reach its pre-2009 levels. Commercial property values declined by approximately 30%. Non-performing loans rose to a reported 6.1% in 2011, increasing pressure on the banking system. With a small population and modest economy, Cyprus had a large offshore banking industry. Compared to a nominal GDP of €19.5bn ($24bn) the banks had amassed €22 billion of Greek private- sector debt with bank deposits $120bn, including $60bn from Russia business corporations. Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev owned a 10% shareholding of Bank of Cyprus. Cyprus banks first came under severe financial pressure as bad debt ratios rose. Former Laiki CEO Efthimios Bouloutas admitted that his bank was probably insolvent as early as 2008, even before Cyprus entered the Eurozone. The banks were then exposed to a haircut of upwards of 50% in 2011 during the Greek government-debt crisis, leading to fears of a collapse of the Cypriot banks. The Cypriot state, unable to raise liquidity from the markets to support its financial sector, requested a bailout from the European Union. Progress on fiscal and structural reforms was slow and following a serious, accidental explosion in July 2011 at the Evangelos Florakis Naval Base the major credit rating agencies downgraded the country's rating in September. Yields on its long-term bonds rose above 12% and there was concern that the country would be unable to stabilize its banks. Response Emergency loan (2012) Since January 2012, Cyprus had been relying on a €2.5bn (US$3.236 billion) emergency loan from Russia to cover its budget deficit and refinance maturing debt. The loan has an interest rate of 4.5%, with no amortization/repayment until its maturity ends after 4.5 years, and no penalty if repayment at that point of time will be delayed, in the event of a persisting lack of access for Cyprus to cover its financial needs through the normal funding markets. The received loan was expected to cover all refinancing of maturing government debt and the amount needed for the government's continued budget deficits, until the first quarter of 2013. But the received loan did not include any funds for the recapitalization of the Cypriot financial sector. Looking further ahead, it was generally expected Cyprus would need to apply for an additional bailout loan. Economic Adjustment Programme for Cyprus Criticism * Irish MEP Nessa Childers, daughter of the country's former President Erskine H. Childers, painted a bleak picture. She described the efforts of the EU-IMF as an \\"incompetent mess\\" and said the Eurozone was more destabilised as a result. * In its Schumpeter blog, The Economist called the Cyprus bail-out unfair, short- sighted and self-defeating. Specifically, the article says * Dr. Jeffrey Stacey wrote in Germany's Der Spiegel, under the headline \\"'Abject Error': How the Cyprus Deal Hurts EU Strategic Interests\\": *Economist Richard D. Wolff commented in an interview in relation to the Cyprus bailout agreement as follows: Local reaction House of Representatives in Nicosia Cyprus has seen a number of reactions and responses towards the austerity measures of the bailout plan. On 8 November 2012, the Cypriot far-left party Committee for a Radical Left Rally (ERAS) organized the first protest against austerity while the Troika negotiations were still taking place. Protesters were gathered outside the House of Representatives holding banners and shouting slogans against austerity. Leaflets with alternative proposals for the economy were distributed in the protest, with proposals including the nationalization of banking, the reduction of the army and the freezing of the army budget, and the increase of the corporate tax. Members of the New Internationalist Left (NEDA) also participated in the protest. On 14 November the New Internationalist Left organised an anti-austerity protest outside the Ministry of Finance in Nicosia together with the Alliance Against the Memorandum. In the protest NEDA gave out leaflets, which expressed the view that \\"the EU is trying to burden the workers with the debts from the collapse of the bankers\\" and that \\"if this happens, the Cypriot economy and the future of the new generations will then be mortgaged to local and foreign profiteers and usurious bankers\\". Contract teachers protested outside the House of Representatives on 29 November against austerity measures that would leave 992 of them without a job next year. The teachers stormed the building and bypassed the policemen, entering the parliament. The teachers shouted against the banks and poverty. A protest by investors was staged on the morning of 11 December outside the House of Representatives, with protesters again storming parliament and bypassing the police. The storming of the parliament led to the interruption of the discussions of the parliamentary committee of customs. The protesters were asked to leave so that the committee could continue its work, and the protesters left half an hour later. A number of protests took place on 12 December. Members of large families protested outside the House of Representatives against cuts in the benefits given by the state to support large families. Protesters threw eggs and stones at the main entrance of the parliament, and a number of protesters tried to enter the building, but were blocked by the police force that arrived to handle the protest. It was reported that a woman fainted during the incidents. The protesters shouted for the MPs to come out but no response was given. The protesters were joined by members of KISOA (Cypriot Confederation of Organisations of the Disabled, Κυπριακή Συνομοσπονδία Οργανώσεων Αναπήρων), who marched from the Ministry of Finance to the House of Representatives to protest against cuts in benefits for people with disabilities. Later in the day members of public school teachers' trade unions protested outside the Ministry of Finance against the cuts in education spending which could result in the firing of teachers. The unions staged another protest the next day near the House of Representatives. Haravgi, a far left-wing newspaper reported that just before bank deposits were blocked a number of companies belonging to family of president Nikos Anastasiadis have transferred over $21m outside of Cyprus. Anastasiadis has denied these allegations. Also a number of loans issued to members of political parties or public administration officers were fully or partially written off. Non-EU bank depositors Non-resident investors who held deposits prior to 15 March 2013 when the plan to impose losses on savers was first formulated, and who lost at least three million euros would be eligible to apply for Cypriot citizenship. Cyprus's existing \\"citizenship by investment\\" program would be revised to reduce the amount of investment required to be eligible for the program to three million euros from the previous ten million euros. \\"These decisions will be deployed in a fast-track manner\\", Anastasiades said in an address to Russian business people in the port city of Limassol in 2013. Other measures were also under consideration, he said, including offering tax incentives for existing or new companies doing business in Cyprus. Distressed investing Frozen deposits in Cyprus banks attracted interest from specialized distressed assets investors and brokers. Among firms reported to be dealing in Cyprus bank debt was London-based Exito Partners (formerly Éxito Capital) and Swiss-based Black Eagle Litigation Fund.

It is located in the Brensholmen area on the western part of the island of Kvaløya. It is the church for the Hillesøy parish which is part of the Tromsø domprosti (arch- deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1889 by the architect D.G. Evjen. The church seats about 300 people. History Originally, Hillesøy Church was located on the island of Hillesøya, just west of Sommarøy. The church had been located there for several hundred years. The church was located there before the first church was built on the nearby island of Tromsøya in the 1200s. Several churches had been built over the centuries on that spot. In the 1800s, the church seated about 150 people, but as time went on, the church became too small for the parish and it was decided to move the church to another location that was more central in the parish. A site at Brensholmen on the western coast of Kvaløya was chosen and the new, larger church was built there in 1889.

It declared itself a political party in 2013 and was registered as such in 2014. Ideology Hayazn had stated its opposition to Armenia's possible integration into the European Union or to the Eurasian Customs Union that included at the time a customs union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia. Hayazn had also called on the Armenian government to opt out of the European Neighbourhood Policy in the past. Hayazn also opposes any official recognition by Armenia of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Instead Hayazn supports the actual unification of the Nagorno-Karabakh areas as an integral part of Armenia, turning Karabakh into an additional Armenian province within the borders of an expanded Armenian Republic. Hayazn also advocates in case of a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, to \\"liberate\\" historical Armenian provinces of Gandzak and Nakhitchevan, presently within the territorial areas of Azerbaijan. In internal affairs, Hayazn is opposed to Serzh Sargsyan's government and has condemned its internal and foreign policies, in particular the way it handles the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict within the OSCE Minsk Group. The party called for a \\"no\\" vote in the 2015 constitutional referendum Activities Although Hayazn was not registered as a political party, and couldn't legally participate in the 2012 parliamentary election, but nonetheless it refused to participate. It blamed mainstream opposition parties (Armenian Revolutionary Federation, Armenian National Congress, Heritage) for not being \\"pro-people\\", and the government for electoral fraud which resulted in the formation of, what they call, an illegitimate government. In June 2011, the union started to collect signatures for the citizenship of Jirair Sefilian, a Lebanese-born Armenian military commander of the Nagorno-Karabakh War. More than 4,000 signatures were gathered. However, the relationship with Sefilian deteriorated, when on September 2, 2013 Hayazn members reportedly attacked and beat-up Varuszhan Avetisyan, the press secretary and member of the Pre-Parliament.Ըստ «Նախախորհրդարանի»՝ «Հայազն» կուսակցության անդամները հարձակվել են իրենց մամուլի խոսնակի վրա On September 1, 2012, Hayazn organized a protest during which several of its members burnt the Hungarian flag as an act of protest against Ramil Safarov's release to Azerbaijan. They also demanded the resignation of the Foreign Minister Eduard Nalbandyan. On May 21, 2012 Hayazn organized a parallel march in opposition to the first of its kind \\"Diversity march\\" organized by the LGBT community of Armenia. The march was stopped prematurely, because LGBT activists were afraid of their safety.Բռնության սպառնալիքների պատճառով «Բազմազանության շաբաթը» չի կայանա On October 10, 2012, Hayazn organized a protest in front of Germany's embassy in Yerevan by the union against the presentation of the film The Parade about gay activism in Serbia. The union stated that they would not tolerate \\"propaganda of immorality\\". During anti-Putin protests on December 2, 2013, several members of Hayazn attacked LGBT rights activist and demanded that they do not fly the Rainbow flag during the protests.Lala Aslikyan. “The rights of homosexuals are violated in CU member countries.” (Video) Throughout spring 2013, Hayazn was a vocal opponent of leasing land in Syunik Province for Iranian pastures.

The corporations sponsor child care as it may increase employee loyalty, decrease maternity leaves and improve on-job concentration.  Scope  Companies have started corporate child care schemes for the young Generation Y employees, many of whom aspire to establish a work- life balance while pursuing a career and gaining money. Many working parents face challenges such as lack of free places in public pre-schools, inappropriate schedule, expensive services of private child care and preschools, low quality of services or little time spending with a child. The corporate child care programs intend to address these issues. Such a program may cover the following: * The company provides new child care places for children * Timetable is adjusted to parents working hours * The company can cover all the expenses or share them with parents * Better quality (due to recruitment system, ongoing education, teachers’ development) * More time to spend with children (during the transfer time) Realization Model Each program provides children with appropriative development environment and education model designed by high-qualified teachers * Nido environment from 0 up to 1 year old * Corporate child center for children 0–3 years old * Corporate kindergarten/center for children 3–6 years old * Back-up care for children 0–3 и 3–6 years old * Corporate children camp for children of different ages (from 3 up to 14) for holidays  Possible benefits  * Increased loyalty of all employees * Qualification maintenance of employees during the maternity leave * Reduced employee absenteeism * Decreased healthcare costs * Increased employee productivity * Strengthened image of caring and responsible employer * Developed family-oriented corporate culture * Cost saved on recruiting and training new employees  References  Category:Child care Category:Employee benefits ","title":"Corporate child care"},{"id":"37925386","text":"Fairgarden is a census-designated place in Sevier County, Tennessee, United States.

It is split between the cities of Fuchu and Koganei within the Tokyo Metropolis. First established in April 1923 as , it was redesignated Tama Cemetery in 1935. It is one of the largest green areas in Tokyo. People interred at Tama Cemetery include: Gensui The Marquis Saigō, the famous Meiji politician and naval commander; Gensui The Marquis Tōgō, the famous naval commander at the Battle of Tsushima; Gensui Yamamoto Isoroku, commander-in-chief of Japan's Combined Fleet during World War II; noted author, playwright, nationalist, and right-wing thinker Mishima Yukio; and General Baron Araki, a military commander who became one of the principal right-wing political theorists of the later Japanese Empire.  History  Around 1900, Tokyo had five public cemeteries - Aoyama, Somei, Yanaka, Zoshigaya and Kameido. As the population of Tokyo grew, and cemetery space grew scarce, there was a need to build a cemetery outside of the city limits of Tokyo. In 1919, city park manager Kiyoshi Inoshita issued a plan to establish a large park/cemetery to the north, east and west of Tokyo. Tama, to the west of Tokyo, was selected in 1920, with construction started two years later. It was said that the site was chosen because of access to transportation infrastructure, such as the Kōshū Kaidō, Keiō Line, Seibu Tamagawa Line, and Chūō Main Line. The cemetery was opened in 1923. The planned northern and eastern cemeteries are Sodaira and Yahashira, respectively. In 1934, Gensui The Marquis Tōgō, the naval war hero, was buried in Tama Cemetery, spreading the popularity of the cemetery. During World War II, Kawasaki Ki-61 from nearby Chofu Airfield were hidden and repaired in the cemetery. Some facilities in the cemetery still have bullet holes from U.S. strafing. Use of the cemetery increased, with the last open spot used in 1963. Since 1963, only reburials and other such uses have opened up new spaces. In 1962 a green lawn-type cemetery was added, and in 1993, Mitama Hall, a columbarium, was added.

A cyberattack is any type of offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal computer devices. An attacker is a person or process that attempts to access data, functions or other restricted areas of the system without authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on context, cyberattacks can be part of cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism. A cyberattack can be employed by sovereign states, individuals, groups, society or organizations, and it may originate from an anonymous source. A product that facilitates a cyberattack is sometimes called a cyberweapon. A cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system. Cyberattacks can range from installing spyware on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations. Legal experts are seeking to limit the use of the term to incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine data breaches and broader hacking activities. Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous.S. Karnouskos: Stuxnet Worm Impact on Industrial Cyber-Physical System Security. In:37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society (IECON 2011), Melbourne, Australia, 7-10 Nov 2011. Retrieved 20 April 2014. User behavior analytics and SIEM can be used to help prevent these attacks.  Definitions  Since the late 1980s cyberattacks have evolved several times to use innovations in information technology as vectors for committing cybercrimes. In recent years, the scale and robustness of cyberattacks has increased rapidly, as observed by the World Economic Forum in its 2018 report: \\"Offensive cyber capabilities are developing more rapidly than our ability to deal with hostile incidents.\\" Alt URL) In May 2000, the Internet Engineering Task Force defined attack in RFC 2828 as: :an assault on system security that derives from an intelligent threat, i.e., an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services and violate the security policy of a system. CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by Committee on National Security Systems of the United States of AmericaCNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 defines an attack as: :Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself. The increasing dependency of modern society on information and computer networks (both in private and public sectors, including the military) has led to new terms like cyber attack and cyberwarfare. CNSS Instruction No. 4009 define a cyber attack as: :An attack, via cyberspace, targeting an enterprise’s use of cyberspace for the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling a computing environment/infrastructure; or destroying the integrity of the data or stealing controlled information. As cars begin to adopt more technology, cyber attacks are becoming a security threat to automobiles.  Prevalence  In the first six months of 2017, two billion data records were stolen or impacted by cyber attacks, and ransomware payments reached , double that in 2016.  Cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism  Cyberwarfare utilizes techniques of defending and attacking information and computer networks that inhabit cyberspace, often through a prolonged cyber campaign or series of related campaigns. It denies an opponent's ability to do the same, while employing technological instruments of war to attack an opponent's critical computer systems. Cyberterrorism, on the other hand, is \\"the use of computer network tools to shut down critical national infrastructures (such as energy, transportation, government operations) or to coerce or intimidate a government or civilian population\\".Lewis, James. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Assessing the Risks of Cyber Terrorism, Cyber War and Other Cyber Threats. Washington, D.C.:, 2002. Web. That means the end result of both cyberwarfare and cyberterrorism is the same, to damage critical infrastructures and computer systems linked together within the confines of cyberspace. The financial crime expert Veit Buetterlin explained that organizations, including state actors, which cannot finance themselves through trade because of imposed sanctions, conduct cyber attacks on banks to generate funds.https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/living- markets/videos/fighting-war-against-terrorist-financing  Factors  Three factors contribute to why cyberattacks are launched against a state or an individual: the fear factor, spectacularity factor, and vulnerability factor.  Spectacularity factor  The spectacularity factor is a measure of the actual damage achieved by an attack, meaning that the attack creates direct losses (usually loss of availability or loss of income) and garners negative publicity. On 8 February 2000, a Denial of Service attack severely reduced traffic to many major sites, including Amazon, Buy.com, CNN, and eBay (the attack continued to affect still other sites the next day). Amazon reportedly estimated the loss of business at $600,000.  Vulnerability factor  Vulnerability factor exploits how vulnerable an organization or government establishment is to cyberattacks. Organizations without maintenance systems might be running on old servers which are more vulnerable than updated systems. An organization can be vulnerable to a denial of service attack and a government establishment can be defaced on a web page. A computer network attack disrupts the integrity or authenticity of data, usually through malicious code that alters program logic that controls data, leading to errors in output.Linden, Edward. Focus on Terrorism. New York: Nova Science Publishers, Inc., 2007. Web.  Professional hackers to cyberterrorists  Professional hackers, either working on their own or employed by government agencies or the military, can find computer systems with vulnerabilities lacking the appropriate security software. Once those vulnerabilities are found, they can infect systems with malicious code and then remotely control the system or computer by sending commands to view content or to disrupt other computers. There needs to be a pre-existing system flaw within the computer such as no antivirus protection or faulty system configuration for the viral code to work. Many professional hackers will promote themselves to cyberterrorists, where a new set of rules govern their actions. Cyberterrorists have premeditated plans and their attacks are not born of rage. They need to develop their plans step-by-step and acquire the appropriate software to carry out an attack. They usually have political agendas, targeting political structures. Cyberterrorists are hackers with a political motivation, their attacks can impact political structure through this corruption and destruction.Prichard, Janet, and Laurie MacDonald. \\"Cyber Terrorism: A Study of the Extent of Coverage in Computer Security Textbooks.\\" Journal of Information Technology Education. 3. (2004): n. page. Web. They also target civilians, civilian interests and civilian installations. As previously stated cyberterrorists attack persons or property and cause enough harm to generate fear.  Types of attack  An attack can be active or passive. : An \\"active attack\\" attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation. : A \\"passive attack\\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources (e.g., wiretapping). An attack can be perpetrated by an insider or from outside the organization; : An \\"inside attack\\" is an attack initiated by an entity inside the security perimeter (an \\"insider\\"), i.e., an entity that is authorized to access system resources but uses them in a way not approved by those who granted the authorization. : An \\"outside attack\\" is initiated from outside the perimeter, by an unauthorized or illegitimate user of the system (an \\"outsider\\"). In the Internet, potential outside attackers range from amateur pranksters to organized criminals, international terrorists, and hostile governments. : Passive vs active attack A resource (both physical or logical), called an asset, can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat agent in a threat action. As a result, the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources may be compromised. Potentially, the damage may extend to resources in addition to the one initially identified as vulnerable, including further resources of the organization, and the resources of other involved parties (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is the basis of information security. The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A \\"passive attack\\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality. A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either \\"intentional\\" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or \\"accidental\\" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an \\"act of God\\" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado). A set of policies concerned with information security management, the information security management systems (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to risk management principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country. An attack should led to a security incident i.e. a security event that involves a security violation. In other words, a security- relevant system event in which the system's security policy is disobeyed or otherwise breached. The overall picture represents the risk factors of the risk scenario. An organization should make steps to detect, classify and manage security incidents. The first logical step is to set up an incident response plan and eventually a computer emergency response team. In order to detect attacks, a number of countermeasures can be set up at organizational, procedural and technical levels. Computer emergency response team, information technology security audit and intrusion detection system are examples of these. An attack usually is perpetrated by someone with bad intentions: black hatted attacks falls in this category, while other perform penetration testing on an organization information system to find out if all foreseen controls are in place. The attacks can be classified according to their origin: i.e. if it is conducted using one or more computers: in the last case is called a distributed attack. Botnets are used to conduct distributed attacks. Other classifications are according to the procedures used or the type of vulnerabilities exploited: attacks can be concentrated on network mechanisms or host features. Some attacks are physical: i.e. theft or damage of computers and other equipment. Others are attempts to force changes in the logic used by computers or network protocols in order to achieve unforeseen (by the original designer) result but useful for the attacker. Software used to for logical attacks on computers is called malware. The following is a partial short list of attacks: * Passive ** Computer and network surveillance ** Network *** Wiretapping *** Fiber tapping *** Port scan *** Idle scan ** Host *** Keystroke logging *** Data scraping *** Backdoor * Active **Denial-of-service attack ***DDos or Distributed Denial of service attack is an attempt made by the hacker to block access to a server or a website that is connected to the Internet. This is achieved using multiple computerized systems, which overloads the target system with requests, making it incapable of responding to any query. ** Spoofing ** Mixed threat attack ** Network *** Man-in-the- middle *** Man-in-the-browser *** ARP poisoning *** Ping flood *** Ping of death *** Smurf attack ** Host *** Buffer overflow *** Heap overflow *** Stack overflow *** Format string attack Intrusion kill chain for information security In detail, there are a number of techniques to utilize in cyberattacks and a variety of ways to administer them to individuals or establishments on a broader scale. Attacks are broken down into two categories: syntactic attacks and semantic attacks. Syntactic attacks are straightforward; it is considered malicious software which includes viruses, worms, and Trojan horses.  Syntactic attacks  = Viruses = A virus is a self-replicating program that can attach itself to another program or file in order to reproduce. The virus can hide in unlikely locations in the memory of a computer system and attach itself to whatever file it sees fit to execute its code. It can also change its digital footprint each time it replicates making it harder to track down in the computer. = Worms = A worm does not need another file or program to copy itself; it is a self- sustaining running program. Worms replicate over a network using protocols. The latest incarnation of worms make use of known vulnerabilities in systems to penetrate, execute their code, and replicate to other systems such as the Code Red II worm that infected more than 259 000 systems in less than 14 hours.Janczewski, Lech, and Andrew Colarik. Cyber Warfare and Cyber Terrorism. Hershey, New York: Information Science Reference, 2008. Web. On a much larger scale, worms can be designed for industrial espionage to monitor and collect server and traffic activities then transmit it back to its creator. = Trojan horses = A Trojan horse is designed to perform legitimate tasks but it also performs unknown and unwanted activity. It can be the basis of many viruses and worms installing onto the computer as keyboard loggers and backdoor software. In a commercial sense, Trojans can be imbedded in trial versions of software and can gather additional intelligence about the target without the person even knowing it happening. All three of these are likely to attack an individual and establishment through emails, web browsers, chat clients, remote software, and updates.  Semantic attacks  Semantic attack is the modification and dissemination of correct and incorrect information. Information modified could have been done without the use of computers even though new opportunities can be found by using them. To set someone into the wrong direction or to cover your tracks, the dissemination of incorrect information can be utilized. = India and Pakistan = There were two such instances between India and Pakistan that involved cyberspace conflicts, started in 1990s. Earlier cyber attacks came to known as early as in 1999. Since then, India and Pakistan were engaged in a long-term dispute over Kashmir which moved into cyberspace. Historical accounts indicated that each country's hackers have been repeatedly involved in attacking each other's computing database system. The number of attacks has grown yearly: 45 in 1999, 133 in 2000, 275 by the end of August 2001. In 2010, Indian hackers laid a cyber attack at least 36 government database websites going by the name \\"Indian Cyber Army\\". In 2013, Indian hackers hacked the official website of Election Commission of Pakistan in an attempt to retrieve sensitive database information. In retaliation, Pakistani hackers, calling themselves \\"True Cyber Army\\" hacked and defaced ~1,059 websites of Indian election bodies. In 2013, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) which was then known as Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY), unveiled a cybersecurity policy framework called National Cyber Security Policy 2013 which officially came into effect on July 1, 2013. According to the media, Pakistan's has been working on effective cyber security system, in a program called the \\"Cyber Secure Pakistan\\" (CSP). The program was launched in April 2013 by Pakistan Information Security Association and the program has expanded to country's universities. In 2020, according to the Media reports, Pakistan Army confirms the series of Cyber Attacks that has been identified on Pakistani Government and private websites by the Indian Intelligence. ISPR also advised the government and private institutions to enhance cyber security measures.  Cyberattacks by and against countries  Within cyberwarfare, the individual must recognize the state actors involved in committing these cyberattacks against one another. The two predominant players that will be discussed is the age-old comparison of East versus West, China's cyber capabilities compared to United States' capabilities. There are many other state and non-state actors involved in cyberwarfare, such as Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Al Qaeda; since China and the U.S. are leading the foreground in cyberwarfare capabilities, they will be the only two state actors discussed. But in Q2 2013, Akamai Technologies reported that Indonesia toppled China with portion 38 percent of cyber attack, a high increase from 21 percent portion in previous quarter. China set 33 percent and US set at 6.9 percent. 79 percent of attack came from Asia Pacific region. Indonesia dominated the attacking to ports 80 and 443 by about 90 percent.  China  China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has developed a strategy called \\"Integrated Network Electronic Warfare\\" which guides computer network operations and cyberwarfare tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance. The Science of Military and The Science of Campaigns both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyberattacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success.Krekel, Bryan. People's Republic of China. The US- China Economic and Security Review Commission.Capability of the People's Republic of China to Conduct Cyber Warfare and Computer Network Exploitation . Virginia: Northrop Grumman, 2009. Web. Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, electronic deception and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all in the hopes of destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's Science of Campaigns noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of \\"blindness\\", \\"deafness\\" or \\"paralysis\\" created by cyberattacks. That is one of the main focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success. The PLA conduct regular training exercises in a variety of environments emphasizing the use of cyberwarfare tactics and techniques in countering such tactics if it is employed against them. Faculty research has been focusing on designs for rootkit usage and detection for their Kylin Operating System which helps to further train these individuals' cyberwarfare techniques. China perceives cyberwarfare as a deterrent to nuclear weapons, possessing the ability for greater precision, leaving fewer casualties, and allowing for long ranged attacks.  Estonia  The 2007 cyberattacks on Estonia were a series of cyberattacks which began on 27 April 2007 and targeted websites of Estonian organizations, including Estonian parliament, banks, ministries, newspapers and broadcasters, amid the country's disagreement with Russia about the relocation of the Bronze Soldier of Tallinn, an elaborate Soviet-era grave marker, as well as war graves in Tallinn. The attacks triggered a number of military organizations around the world to reconsider the importance of network security to modern military doctrine. The direct result of the cyberattacks was the creation of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in Tallinn.  Ethiopia  In an extension of a bilateral dispute between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, Ethiopian government websites have been hacked by the Egypt-based hackers in June 2020.  Iran  On 8 February 2020, the telecommunication network of Iran witnessed extensive disruptions at 11:44 a.m. local time, which lasted for about an hour. The Ministry of Information and Communications Technology of Iran confirmed it as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The Iranian authorities activated the \\"Digital Fortress\\" cyber-defense mechanism to repel. Also known as DZHAFA, it led to a drop of 75 percent in the national internet connectivity.  Israel  In April 2020, there were attempts to hack into Israel's water infrastructure of the Sharon central region by Iran, which was thwarted by Israeli cyber defenses. The cyberattack intended to introduce dangerous levels of chlorine into the Israeli water supply.  North Korea   Norway  In August 2020 the Norwegian parliament Stortinget suffered a cyber-attack on the email system belonging to several officials, and some information had been downloaded. But the full extent of damage caused by the hack has not been made public. The Norwegian government issued a public statement in October 2020 announcing Russia as the culprit. Norway's foreign minister Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide called it a serious incident affecting the country's «most important democratic institution». Moscow rejected the claim, calling it a «serious and wilful provocation». The attack is still under investigation by Norwegian Police Security Service as of October 2020.https://www.lifeinnorway.net/norway-blames-russia-for-parliament-email- hack/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54518106  Russia  During the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Russia countered and stopped around 25 million cyber attacks on IT Infrastructure. In June 2019, Russia has conceded that it is \\"possible\\" its electrical grid is under cyberattack by the United States. The New York Times reported that American hackers from the United States Cyber Command planted malware potentially capable of disrupting the Russian electrical grid.  Ukraine  A series of powerful cyber attacks began 27 June 2017 that swamped websites of Ukrainian organizations, including banks, ministries, newspapers and electricity firms.  United Arab Emirates  In 2019, Reuters reported that United Arab Emirates launched a series of cyberattacks on its political opponents, journalists, and human rights activists under Project Raven, on an espionage platform namely Karma. The team included ex-US intelligence agents. Project Raven commenced in 2009 and was planned to be continued for the coming ten years.  United States  In the West, the United States provides a different \\"tone of voice\\" when cyberwarfare is on the tip of everyone's tongue. The United States provides security plans strictly in the response to cyberwarfare, basically going on the defensive when they are being attacked by devious cyber methods. In the U.S., the responsibility of cybersecurity is divided between the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Defense. In recent years, a new department was created to specifically tend to cyber threats, this department is known as Cyber Command. Cyber Command is a military subcommand under US Strategic Command and is responsible for dealing with threats to the military cyber infrastructure. Cyber Command's service elements include Army Forces Cyber Command, the Twenty-fourth Air Force, Fleet Cyber Command and Marine Forces Cyber Command.Lewis, James, and Katrina Timlin. United States. Center for Strategic and International Studies. Cybersecurity and Cyberwarfare: Preliminary Assessment of National Doctrine and Organization. Washington, D.C.:, 2011. Web. It ensures that the President can navigate and control information systems and that he also has military options available when defense of the nation needs to be enacted in cyberspace. Individuals at Cyber Command must pay attention to state and non- state actors who are developing cyberwarfare capabilities in conducting cyber espionage and other cyberattacks against the nation and its allies. Cyber Command seeks to be a deterrence factor to dissuade potential adversaries from attacking the U.S., while being a multi-faceted department in conducting cyber operations of its own. Three prominent events took place which may have been catalysts in the creation of the idea of Cyber Command. There was a failure of critical infrastructure reported by the CIA where malicious activities against information technology systems disrupted electrical power capabilities overseas. This resulted in multi-city power outages across multiple regions. The second event was the exploitation of global financial services. In November 2008, an international bank had a compromised payment processor that allowed fraudulent transactions to be made at more than 130 automated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period.United States. Review Team of Government Cybersecurity Experts. Cyberspace Policy Review: Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information and Communications Infrastructure. Washington, D.C.:, Web. The last event was the systemic loss of U.S. economic value when an industry in 2008 estimated $1 trillion in losses of intellectual property to data theft. Even though all these events were internal catastrophes, they were very real in nature, meaning nothing can stop state or non-state actors to do the same thing on an even grander scale. Other initiatives like the Cyber Training Advisory Council were created to improve the quality, efficiency, and sufficiency of training for computer network defense, attack, and exploitation of enemy cyber operations. On both ends of the spectrum, East and West nations show a \\"sword and shield\\" contrast in ideals. The Chinese have a more offensive minded idea for cyberwarfare, trying to get the pre- emptive strike in the early stages of conflict to gain the upper-hand. In the U.S. there are more reactionary measures being taken at creating systems with impenetrable barriers to protect the nation and its civilians from cyberattacks. According to Homeland Preparedness News, many mid-sized U.S. companies have a difficult time defending their systems against cyber attacks. Around 80 percent of assets vulnerable to a cyber attack are owned by private companies and organizations. Former New York State Deputy Secretary for Public Safety Michael Balboni said that private entities \\"do not have the type of capability, bandwidth, interest or experience to develop a proactive cyber analysis.\\" In response to cyberattacks on 1 April 2015, President Obama issued an Executive Order establishing the first-ever economic sanctions. The Executive Order will impact individuals and entities (\\"designees\\") responsible for cyberattacks that threaten the national security, foreign policy, economic health, or financial stability of the US. Specifically, the Executive Order authorizes the Treasury Department to freeze designees' assets. According to Ted Koppel's book, in 2008, the United States in collaboration with Israel, ran a cyberattack on Iran's nuclear program, becoming \\"the first to use a digital weapon as an instrument of policy\\".  Consequence of a potential attack  A whole industry is working trying to minimize the likelihood and the consequence of an information attack. For a partial list see: Computer security software companies. They offer different products and services, aimed at: * study all possible attacks category * publish books and articles about the subject * discovering vulnerabilities * evaluating the risks * fixing vulnerabilities * invent, design and deploy countermeasures * set up contingency plan in order to be ready to respond Many organizations are trying to classify vulnerability and their consequence: the most famous vulnerability database is the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Computer emergency response teams are set up by government and large organization to handle computer security incidents.  Infrastructures as targets  Once a cyberattack has been initiated, there are certain targets that need to be attacked to cripple the opponent. Certain infrastructures as targets have been highlighted as critical infrastructures in times of conflict that can severely cripple a nation. Control systems, energy resources, finance, telecommunications, transportation, and water facilities are seen as critical infrastructure targets during conflict. A new report on the industrial cybersecurity problems, produced by the British Columbia Institute of Technology, and the PA Consulting Group, using data from as far back as 1981, reportedly has found a 10-fold increase in the number of successful cyberattacks on infrastructure Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems since 2000. Cyberattacks that have an adverse physical effect are known as cyber-physical attacks.  Control systems  Control systems are responsible for activating and monitoring industrial or mechanical controls. Many devices are integrated with computer platforms to control valves and gates to certain physical infrastructures. Control systems are usually designed as remote telemetry devices that link to other physical devices through internet access or modems. Little security can be offered when dealing with these devices, enabling many hackers or cyberterrorists to seek out systematic vulnerabilities. Paul Blomgren, manager of sales engineering at cybersecurity firm explained how his people drove to a remote substation, saw a wireless network antenna and immediately plugged in their wireless LAN cards. They took out their laptops and connected to the system because it wasn't using passwords. \\"Within 10 minutes, they had mapped every piece of equipment in the facility,\\" Blomgren said. \\"Within 15 minutes, they mapped every piece of equipment in the operational control network. Within 20 minutes, they were talking to the business network and had pulled off several business reports. They never even left the vehicle.\\"Lyons, Marty. United States. Homeland Security. Threat Assessment of Cyber Warfare. Washington, D.C.:, 2005. Web.  Energy  Energy is seen as the second infrastructure that could be attacked. It is broken down into two categories, electricity and natural gas. Electricity also known as electric grids power cities, regions, and households; it powers machines and other mechanisms used in day-to-day life. Using US as an example, in a conflict cyberterrorists can access data through the Daily Report of System Status that shows power flows throughout the system and can pinpoint the busiest sections of the grid. By shutting those grids down, they can cause mass hysteria, backlog, and confusion; also being able to locate critical areas of operation to further attacks in a more direct method. Cyberterrorists can access instructions on how to connect to the Bonneville Power Administration which helps direct them on how to not fault the system in the process. This is a major advantage that can be utilized when cyberattacks are being made because foreign attackers with no prior knowledge of the system can attack with the highest accuracy without drawbacks. Cyberattacks on natural gas installations go much the same way as it would with attacks on electrical grids. Cyberterrorists can shutdown these installations stopping the flow or they can even reroute gas flows to another section that can be occupied by one of their allies. There was a case in Russia with a gas supplier known as Gazprom, they lost control of their central switchboard which routes gas flow, after an inside operator and Trojan horse program bypassed security.  Finance  Financial infrastructures could be hit hard by cyberattacks as the financial system is linked by computer systems. Money is constantly being exchanged in these institutions and if cyberterrorists were to attack and if transactions were rerouted and large amounts of money stolen, financial industries would collapse and civilians would be without jobs and security. Operations would stall from region to region causing nationwide economic degradation. In the U.S. alone, the average daily volume of transactions hit $3 trillion and 99% of it is non- cash flow. To be able to disrupt that amount of money for one day or for a period of days can cause lasting damage making investors pull out of funding and erode public confidence. A cyberattack on a financial institution or transactions may be referred to as a cyberheist. These attacks may start with phishing that targets employees, using social engineering to coax information from them. They may allow attackers to hack into the network and put keyloggers on the accounting systems. In time, the cybercriminals are able to obtain password and keys information. An organization's bank accounts can then be accessed via the information they have stolen using the keyloggers. In May 2013, a gang carried out a US$40 million cyberheist from the Bank of Muscat.  Telecommunications  Cyberattacking telecommunication infrastructures have straightforward results. Telecommunication integration is becoming common practice, systems such as voice and IP networks are merging. Everything is being run through the internet because the speeds and storage capabilities are endless. Denial-of-service attacks can be administered as previously mentioned, but more complex attacks can be made on BGP routing protocols or DNS infrastructures. It is less likely that an attack would target or compromise the traditional telephony network of SS7 switches, or an attempted attack on physical devices such as microwave stations or satellite facilities. The ability would still be there to shut down those physical facilities to disrupt telephony networks. The whole idea on these cyberattacks is to cut people off from one another, to disrupt communication, and by doing so, to impede critical information being sent and received. In cyberwarfare, this is a critical way of gaining the upper-hand in a conflict. By controlling the flow of information and communication, a nation can plan more accurate strikes and enact better counter-attack measures on their enemies.  Transportation  Transportation infrastructure mirrors telecommunication facilities; by impeding transportation for individuals in a city or region, the economy will slightly degrade over time. Successful cyberattacks can impact scheduling and accessibility, creating a disruption in the economic chain. Carrying methods will be impacted, making it hard for cargo to be sent from one place to another. In January 2003 during the \\"slammer\\" virus, Continental Airlines was forced to shut down flights due to computer problems. Cyberterrorists can target railroads by disrupting switches, target flight software to impede airplanes, and target road usage to impede more conventional transportation methods. In May 2015, a man, Chris Roberts, who was a cyberconsultant, revealed to the FBI that he had repeatedly, from 2011 to 2014, managed to hack into Boeing and Airbus flights' controls via the onboard entertainment system, allegedly, and had at least once ordered a flight to climb. The FBI, after detaining him in April 2015 in Syracuse, had interviewed him about the allegations.  Water  Water as an infrastructure could be one of the most critical infrastructures to be attacked. It is seen as one of the greatest security hazards among all of the computer-controlled systems. There is the potential to have massive amounts of water unleashed into an area which could be unprotected causing loss of life and property damage. It is not even water supplies that could be attacked; sewer systems can be compromised too. There was no calculation given to the cost of damages, but the estimated cost to replace critical water systems could be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Most of these water infrastructures are well developed making it hard for cyberattacks to cause any significant damage, at most, equipment failure can occur causing power outlets to be disrupted for a short time.  Hospitals  Hospital as an infrastructure is one of the major assets to have been impacted by cyberattacks. These attacks could \\"directly lead to deaths.\\" The cyberattacks are designed to deny hospital workers access to critical care systems. Recently, there has been a major increase of cyberattacks against hospitals amid covid-19 pandemic. Hackers lock up a network and demand ransom to return access to these systems. The ICRC and other human rights group have urged law enforcement to take “immediate and decisive action” to punish such cyberattackers.

Michigan Newell played college football for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. As a junior, he was the leading tackler for the 1969 Michigan Wolverines football team with a total of 70 tackles.(To retrieve 1969 team statistics, enter \\"1969\\" in the space for \\"Enter year.\\") The 1969 team was the first Michigan team to be coached by Bo Schembechler. It defeated the No. 1 ranked Ohio State Buckeyes to advance to the 1970 Rose Bowl. Newell had 14 tackles in the Rose Bowl, tied for second most on the team. Newell was politically active while at Michigan. During the fall of 1969, he was faced with a choice between traveling with the Michigan football team to Iowa for a football game scheduled for November 15, 1969, or traveling to Washington, D.C., to be part of the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, an antiwar protest that attracted over 500,000 demonstrators on the same day.

Professional football In January 1971, Newell was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round (125th overall pick) of the 1971 NFL Draft. However, he did not appear in any regular season NFL games. In September 1971, the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League announced that they were giving Newell a five-day tryout. After the trial period, he was activated by the Lions. He appeared in one game for the Lions and was released on September 24, 1971. Later years After retiring from football, Newell returned to the Chicago area. He worked for 32 years in the financial services field for Smith Barney/Citigroup Global Markets, and he also served as the president of the Chicago Bond Club, the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the University of Michigan Club of Chicago.

It comprises 200 local unions nationwide with a mass membership of over 100,000 laborers. Founded in 1993 as a result of the split in Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), about 70 percent of KMU's membership left the organization to form BMP as a counterpose to its sectarian politics that failed to unite Filipino workers and advance the Philippine labor movement. Campaigns In 1993, BMP initiated the formation of Labor Alliance for Wage Increase (LAWIN), a broad alliance of labor organizations campaigning for a P35 across-the-board increase in the minimum wage. The government yielded and gave workers a P25 wage increase. Together with Sanlakas, BMP was instrumental in creating the Kilusang Roll Back (Roll Back Movement or KRB), which campaigned for the rollback of fuel prices in the Philippines. Then Philippine President Fidel Ramos was forced to lower the prices of oil by an average of one peso per liter. In 1995, together with at least 80,000 people, BMP campaigned against the creation of the Expanded Value Added Tax (E-VAT) during President Ramos' State of the Nation Address (SONA). With the help of Sanlakas and other labor organizations, BMP sponsored the biggest Anti-Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Conference and biggest Anti-APEC protest caravan from Manila to Subic during the 1996 APEC Summit at Subic Bay in Central Luzon, Philippines.Mass anti-APEC movement in the Philippines  Green Left Weekly In 1997, BMP, with the help of the Federation of Free Workers, organized a unified labor support to the struggle of the dismissed workers of the German- owned Telefunken Microelectronics (TEMIC).

Newcomer actor Ryan Phillippe played the role from April 1992 until May 1993. The character is the first openly gay teenager featured in a television series, and Phillippe's breakthrough role is considered groundbreaking in daytime television. Creation Casting and background In 1992, One Life to Live executive producer Linda Gottlieb hired a fresh-faced 17-year-old Ryan Phillippe to play the newly created role. Phillippe said he was warned against playing the \\"risky\\" role at the height of the AIDS crisis in the United States. Phillippe said that when he auditioned to play the character, he \\"had no idea Billy was gay.\\" He initially expressed reservation to pursue the opportunity, telling Entertainment Weekly in 1992, \\"I thought, 'What is my family going to think? What about my friends?' But I realized that for [the character] Billy, the torment is a hundred times that.\\" Ryan Phillippe (pictured here in 2010) portrayed Billy Douglas from 1992 to 1993. Show head writer Michael Malone developed Billy Douglas as a popular but closeted high school junior who is a jock that becomes class president. At the time, the role was regarded as \\"one of the longest and complex narratives to deal with a lesbian or gay character.\\" When playing the role, Phillippe said that he hoped to leave a positive impact, saying, \\"Maybe some kids will see that there are ways to deal with this positively.\\" Years after leaving soap operas and starting his film career, Phillippe said of playing the character, \\"I felt lucky playing the first gay teenager on television—not just daytime, but television, period.\\" Characterization The role was portrayed as a heroic figure, displaying traits of courage in spite of facing homophobia from his father Walter (Jonathan Hogan), high school classmates, and members of the fictional Llanview community. Storyline Homophobia is stirred in fictional Llanview in early 1992 with new arrivals to town Reverend Andrew Carpenter (Wortham Krimmer), and Andrew's father and retired army general Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes). Sloan is newly diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and had come to town to make peace with his son Andrew. Andrew then seeks out to make peace with his father about his gay brother, William, who dies of the HIV/AIDS virus off-screen and for whom Sloan is ashamed. Billy (Phillippe) arrives in the Philadelphia Main Line suburb in April 1992. A junior at Llanview High School, he befriends Joey Buchanan (Chris McKenna), the son of town heroine and series protagonist Victoria Lord Buchanan (Erika Slezak). Closeted Billy comes out to Joey, who is shocked but accepting of his friend's sexual orientation, choosing to stay friends. Conflicted, Billy seeks counseling from Reverend Carpenter about coming out to his parents. Andrew encourages Billy to embrace his sexuality and to do what he feels is right. Town pariah Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) eavesdrops on Billy and Andrew's counseling session. Marty seeks a romantic relationship with Andrew, but her advances are rebuffed. Angry, Marty goes to Billy's parents and tells them Andrew is a homosexual and molesting Billy. Billy's parents, Walter (Hogan) and Virginia Douglas (Susan Pellegrino), proceed to wage a campaign against the moral character of Reverend Carpenter and his Saint James Church. Andrew's girlfriend Cassie Callison (Laura Koffman) receives an anonymous letter calling her a \\"fag lover.\\" The church is vandalized with hate speech, leading its vestry to ask the priest to come out, but he refuses, avowing a right to privacy. Andrew campaigns to bring the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt to Llanview and place a patch on it in honor of his brother, which angers Sloan. Prejudice takes hold in Llanview in June 1992, and new police lieutenant Maggie Vega (Yvette Lawrence) takes names of gay officers on her police squad. Andrew implores Marty to retract her accusation, but she refuses. When the AIDS quilt arrives in Llanview, Andrew is beaten in a hate crime and parishioners bar him from returning to the church. At the church, Billy defends Andrew to a protest led by his parents to allow Andrew into the church. At the pulpit, Andrew delivers a stirring sermon on privacy and tolerance, swaying all of his congregation but Billy's father, who encourages parishioners to rebuke the priest. Billy comes out to his father, who rejects him. His mother Virginia espouses her support in spite of hatred from some townspeople, some of whom begin to accept him. The reputation of Reverend Carpenter is restored, as he succeeds in winning hearts and minds. Billy is paired in a romantic relationship with waiter Rick Mitchell (Joe Fiske) in December 1992. The role is written out of the show as leaving Llanview to start college at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut in the spring of 1993. The character is rarely, if ever, mentioned again. Reception The character of Billy, created by Michael Malone, is considered one of the first serious attempts at portraying young gay characters on American television. The portrayal of the role by newcomer actor Ryan Phillippe was well received. Authors Robin Anderson and Jonathan Gray say, \\"Billy's story was an important TV milestone in that he was depicted as a well-adjusted and functional gay teen.\\" Hundreds to thousands of pieces of fan mail arrived at the show's Lincoln Square, New York City studios at ABC due to both Phillippe and character's popularity. The actor called the fan response in the letters \\"amazing,\\" and said, \\"Kids who'd never seen themselves represented on TV or in movies would write to say what a huge support they found it to be.\\" Interestingly, gay teenagers were not the audience for which the story was targeted, but rather prejudiced viewers, in the style of series creator and original head writer Agnes Nixon and her Carla Gray character played actress Ellen Holly. GLAAD lauded Ryan Phillippe for his work in playing Billy. The program began receiving negative fan mail amid pairing Billy in a romantic relationship with Rick Mitchell (Joe Fiske) in December 1992, and wrote the character out with Phillippe leaving the series in 1993, with one show writer remarking that it was \\"difficult to maintain a homosexual character as a hero.\\" In spite of any difficulty with showcasing the role, a viewer expressed disappointment with the \\"well-researched, well-written\\" character being written off the show to Soap Opera Digest, continuing that \\"[Michael] Malone is doing a great disservice by not opening up the next chapter in this character's life.\\" References External links * Billy Douglas on IMDb *Billy Douglas profile – SoapCentral.com Category:One Life to Live characters Category:Fictional gay males Category:Television characters introduced in 1992 Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television Category:Fictional college students ","title":"Billy Douglas (One Life to Live)"},{"id":"37925785","text":"Flat Top Mountain is a census-designated place in Hamilton County, Tennessee, United States.

Founded in 2001 as Kryptiq Corporation, the company specializes in electronic medical records and secure communications between physicians and patients. The 125-employee company was purchased by Surescripts in 2012, which was a previous investor in the company. Annual revenues at the time of the sale were approximately $25 million. In January 2015, the company announced that it was splitting from Surescripts and becoming independent again. History The company was founded in 2001 by Luis Machuca, Jeff Sponaugle, and Murali Karamchedu, with the company first housed in Machuca’s home. Kryptiq opened its first office in Beaverton, Oregon, in October 2001 after securing $2 million in capital. Kryptiq was founded largely by former employees of Intel Corporation as well as those from eFusion looking to use their encryption experience and expertise to provide secure email for the health care field. By September 2002, the company had grown to 15 employees and had a board of directors heavy on those with Intel ties, such as Andy Bryant. The company’s original production was a subscription-based email add-on that allowed physicians to securely communicate with patients and others and data protected by HIPAA. In July 2003, the company purchased software company RosettaMed, with plans to incorporate their software into Kryptiq’s existing programs. In August of that year, Kryptiq finished raising $7.9 million in venture capital from investors such as Voyager Capital and SmartForest Ventures. The company continued with acquisitions in November when it purchased MedShape LLC, allowing Kryptiq to expand into the medical records field. Kryptiq retained all six employees who had developed DocuTrak and RosettaStone. By December 2003 the company had grown to 50 employees and projected to be cash flow positive by the end of 2004. Former headquarters at the Rock Creek Corporate Center Kryptiq launched CareManager in 2004, a disease management software program. CareManager was developed with Providence Health System, and the program was awarded the e-Health Leadership Award in 2004 by the Disease Management Association of America. Then in January 2004, Kryptiq acquired This Computer Solution Inc. in an all-stock deal. The Vancouver, Washington, company had developed software for managing contracts for health insurers. In January 2005, the company moved from Beaverton to Hillsboro and finished the prior year with 200% growth. By February of that year, Kryptiq had expanded to 60 employees, become a member of the Center for Health Transformation, and added GE Healthcare as a partner. The company raised $7.1 million in capital in 2005, with investors including SmartForest Ventures, Voyager Capital, and Shelter Capital Partners, with the round closing in April. At the time, Kryptiq was then 65 percent owned by investors. In July 2005, the company announced they would move from the AmberGlen Business Center to a space in the Rock Creek Corporate Center along U.S. 26, both in Hillsboro. Shelter Capital Partners, SmartForest Ventures, the Oregon Investment Fund, and others invested another combined $6.6 million in Kryptiq in September 2006. Company headquarters from 2010 to mid-2016 In March 2007, Kryptiq licensed their Choreo medical records system to The Regence Group in an effort to further penetrate the BlueCross and BlueShied marketplace, with implementation starting in June 2007. Microsoft teamed up with Kryptiq later in 2007 to launch HealthVault, a Microsoft product the later was using to enter the consumer healthcare market. The company sold off its software division that focused on health plan management to Porticio Systems in April 2009. * * In August 2008, the company bought Secure Network Solutions. The company announced in June 2010 they would move to the AmberGlen business park into a space. In October 2010, Surescripts invested in Kryptiq and signed-on to use Kryptiq’s secure technology in Surescripts’ products. At the time, Kryptiq had climbed to 90 employees, and the next month secured an $8 million investment related to the Surescripts deal. Growth from the Surescripts deal led to an increase of employees to 120 and a need to add of office space. Headquarters in 2019, in Beaverton, Oregon Surescripts acquired all of Kryptiq in August 2012, which exercised such an option from the prior deal that brought Surescripts in with a 21% ownership stake. At the time of the purchase, Kryptiq had revenues of about $25 million annually and 125 employees. In January 2015, the company announced that it was splitting from Surescripts and becoming independent again. The company changed its name to Enli Health Intelligence in September 2015. In August 2016, Enli was still headquartered on Amberglen Parkway, in eastern Hillsboro, but by October 2016 it had relocated its corporate headquarters to NW 167th Avenue, in northern Beaverton (a little more than one mile to the east). Products Kryptiq licenses a variety of healthcare related software to both healthcare providers and health insurers. These products include CareManager, DocuSign for Patients, Secure Messaging, Automated Clinical Messaging, Patient Portal, ePrescribing, and others that provide services such as document management. The Secure Messaging program is the backbone of the network utilized by parent company Surescripts, which is used by doctors to share patient records and information electronically. Kryptiq’s Patient Portal allows providers to accept payments from patients over the internet, which totaled almost $10 million in 2011. Customers include Providence Health System, MeritCare Health System, GE Healthcare, and MedStar Health, among others.

Criminal records are compiled and updated on local, state, and federal levels by government agencies, most often law enforcement agencies. Their primary purpose is to present a comprehensive criminal history for a specific individual. Criminal records may be used for many purposes, including for background checks for purposes of employment, security clearance, adoption, immigration to the United States, and licensing. Criminal records may be useful for identifying suspects within the course of a criminal investigation. They may be used for enhanced sentencing in criminal prosecutions. Background investigations Criminal history information is generally available to the public, and criminal history information for a specific state can typically be obtained from the state agency that maintains the record. States normally charge a fee for a copy of a person's criminal history. Private individuals can typically obtain copies of their own records, but may need a release in order to obtain the record of another person. In the United States, any person, including a private investigator, criminal research or background check company, may go to a county courthouse and search an index of criminal records by name and date of birth or have a county clerk search for records on an individual. Such a search may produce information about criminal and non-criminal charges that do not otherwise appear on a state criminal history abstract. For employment screening purposes, unless state law provides otherwise, criminal convictions may be reported to a potential employer within a 7-year time range from the date of conviction. State records State criminal histories are maintained by government agencies, most often by law enforcement agencies. In addition to statewide records, local police departments, sheriffs' offices, and specialty police agencies may maintain their own internal databases. Records are also maintained by state departments of correction, in relation to offenders who have been sentenced to prison or a similar disposition that falls under their jurisdiction. Law enforcement agencies often share criminal history information with other enforcement agencies, and criminal history information is normally also available to the public.See, e.g., All states have official \\"statewide repositories\\" that contain criminal history information contributed by the various county and municipal courts within the state. In some states, minor criminal offenses are not included in the statewide record, or are included only if voluntarily reported by the court in which a conviction occurs. Juvenile records Most states provide some level of protection to juvenile criminal proceedings, and records of adjudication that result from the prosecution of a minor. The extent to which juvenile records are protected varies significantly by state. Sex offender registries Registered sex offenders have information about their crimes or misdemeanors readily available, and Department of Correctional Services in many states disseminate sex offender to the public, through media such as the Internet. The U.S. Department of Justice maintains a national sex offender database. Some states exclude juveniles from sex offender registries.See, e.g., Adults may be able to petition for exclusion from the registry under state law.See, e.g., Texas In Texas, the Department of Public Safety maintains the Computerized Criminal History System (CCH) and Texas Public Sex Offender Registry. The criteria for inclusion in the CCH is outlined as being convictions and deferred adjudications that are \\"reported to the Department on an offense.\\" Federal records The federal government maintains extensive criminal histories and acts as a central repository for all agencies to report their own data. Department of Justice =National Crime Information Center= The NCIC (National Crime Information Center) is a repository of criminal history information that has been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The NCIC stores information regarding open arrest warrants, arrests, stolen property, missing persons, and dispositions regarding felonies and misdemeanors. With a very few exceptions, the records compiled by the federal government within the NCIC are not made available to the private sector. The FBI's compilation of an individual's criminal identification, arrest, conviction, and incarceration information is known as the Interstate Identification Index, or \\"Triple-I\\" for short. This is basically the FBI's rap sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution). It contains information voluntarily reported by law enforcement agencies across the country, as well as information provided by other federal agencies. It contains information on felonies and misdemeanors, and may also contain municipal and traffic offenses if reported by the individual agencies. Each individual who has an entry in the Interstate Identification Index has a unique \\"FBI number\\" that is used to identify a specific individual. It compensates for the fact that an individual may provide several false names, or aliases, to a law enforcement agency when he or she is booked. An individual may also lie about his or her date of birth or social security number as well, making an independent, unique identification key necessary. It is important to note that the information provided by the Interstate Information Index may come from the agency who \\"booked\\" the individual and not necessarily the agency who arrested the individual. Therefore, there may be discrepancies between the arrest date, location, and arresting agency listed in the database and the actual date, location, and agency who made the arrest. The Interstate Information Index may also contain incarceration information as well, listing each time an inmate is transferred from one correctional institution to another as a separate \\"arrest.\\" The Interstate Information Index is only as accurate as the information reported to it by individual agencies, and frequently lacks comprehensive information on the dispositions of the various arrests it lists. It is best used as a guide on where to find more comprehensive information on the individual. =National Instant Criminal Background Check System= Mandated by the Brady Bill, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is used by the FBI to screen potential firearms buyers. Citizens who are currently ineligible to own a firearm under current laws may have the opportunity to have their firearms rights restored. Eligibility largely depends on state laws. In addition to searching the NCIC databases, NICS maintains its own index to search for additional disqualifiers from gun ownership. Private companies are not allowed access to this system for background checks. =Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System= The FBI maintains the largest biometric database in the world with the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS). Criminal submissions from arrests and civil submissions from authorized background checks are stored in IAFIS. Currently, IAFIS has more than 47 million submissions in its repository. =Combined DNA Index System= The Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) stores DNA profiles for both convicted felons in the Offender Index as well as unidentified DNA found at crime scenes in the Forensic Index. CODIS was originally piloted in 1990 as a project among 14 states. Currently, all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the United States Government participate in CODIS. Department of Transportation =National Driver Register= While not officially a criminal history repository, the National Driver Register (NDR), operated by the Department of Transportation, maintains information on drivers regarding suspended licenses. The NDR maintains a database of information posted by individual states as mandated by federal law. All drivers who have had their licenses suspended for any reason (including suspensions resulting from several successive minor traffic violations: Massachusetts suspends for three separate speeding tickets over a six-month period) have that information posted by state Registry of Motor Vehicles offices to the NDR. Also, the NDR records information concerning convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, failing to render aid at an accident involving death or injury, and knowingly making a false affidavit or committing perjury to officials about an activity governed by a law or regulation on the operation of a motor vehicle. Additionally, the NDR contains information on traffic violations resulting from a fatal automobile accident. =Secure Flight= Secure Flight, operated by the Transportation Security Administration, screens United States airline passengers to see if they are on terrorism watch lists. Unlike the predecessors Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) & CAPPS II, Secure Flight does not scan passengers for outstanding warrants nor does Secure Flight use computer algorithms to search for links to flagged terrorists. Obtaining copies of federal criminal records It is possible to obtain copies of criminal records maintained by Federal agencies under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act. In general, you may only obtain records concerning yourself, deceased individuals, or living individuals who have given you their permission to obtain their records. Interstate records Most states have a statewide agency that acts as a clearinghouse for all statewide arrest information. These so-called \\"state rap sheets\\" are usually much more detailed than the Interstate Identification Index; usually listing not only the arrest information, but the subsequent court action following that arrest. National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System The National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) is an interface to search each state's criminal and driver records as well as the License Plate Reader (LPR) records going back one year maintained by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Thus through NLETS, a law enforcement agency in one state could search for someone's criminal and driver records in another state. NLETS potentially serves as a better tool to search for minor misdemeanors and traffic violations that would not be in the NCIC. Expungement In the United States, criminal records may be expunged, though laws vary by state. Many types of offenses may be expunged, ranging from parking fines to felonies. In general, once sealed or expunged, all records of an arrest and/or subsequent court case are removed from the public record, and the individual may legally deny or fail to acknowledge ever having been arrested for or charged with any crime which has been expunged. However, when applicants for a state professional license or job that is considered a public office or high security (such as security guard, law enforcement, or related to national security) must confess if they have an expunged conviction or else be denied clearance by the DOJ. With few exceptions, there is no post-conviction relief available in the federal system other than a presidential pardon.

The film is an interpretation of the Book of Revelation and the End Times and centers around a secret human cloning project which attempts to reproduce the Second Coming of Christ, but the child is born without a soul and is, instead, the Antichrist. Plot This sci-fi thriller concerns Dr. Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath), a seemingly infertile young woman who will do virtually anything in her power to conceive a child. Through the miracle of modern science, she inherits a cloned son named David (Rocko Hale). For a time, all appears well, until David reaches his seventh birthday, and disasters suddenly begin to plague the earth—disasters that seem to be emanating from the young boy himself. Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell) turns up and admits a long-buried secret: the DNA used to clone David came from the Shroud of Turin, the clean linen cloth in which Joseph of Arimathea wrapped the body of Jesus Christ that bears His image. Cast * Bridget McGrath (Credited also Shar Stephanie) as Dr. Kimberly Gabriel * Charles Hubbell as Dr. Roger Gibson * Rocco Hale as David * Joseph Andrew Schneider as Bruce Related works The April 5, 2004 issue of New York Magazine credits the 1988 novel, Children of the Shroud, as being the first to feature a story about cloned Jesuses. The novel was written by Garfield Reeves-Stevens, one half of the New York Times bestselling husband- and-wife writer/producer team of Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Subsequent novels in the \\"Jesus cloned from the Shroud of Turin\\" subgenre include The Blood of the Lamb, by Thomas F. Monteleone (1993), The Christ Clone Trilogy, by James BeauSeigneur (2001), and The Jesus Thief Series, by J.R. Lankford (2003).

Most fish exchange gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide using gills that are protected under gill covers (operculum) on both sides of the pharynx (throat). Gills are tissues that are like short threads, protein structures called filaments. These filaments have many functions including the transfer of ions and water, as well as the exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, acids and ammonia.Hoar WS and Randall DJ (1984) Fish Physiology: Gills: Part A – Anatomy, gas transfer and acid-base regulation Academic Press. .Hoar WS and Randall DJ (1984) Fish Physiology: Gills: Part B – Ion and water transfer Academic Press. . Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen- rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their gills. In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing counter- current exchange. The gills push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called the operculum. Juvenile bichirs have external gills, a very primitive feature that they share with larval amphibians. Previously, the evolution of gills was thought to have occurred through two diverging lines: gills formed from the endoderm, as seen in jawless fish species, or those form by the ectoderm, as seen in jawed fish. However, recent studies on gill formation of the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea) has shown potential evidence supporting the claim that gills from all current fish species have in fact evolved from a common ancestor. Breathing with gills Air breathing fish can be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, are obligated to breathe air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only breathe air if they need to and can otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators. All basal vertebrates breathe with gills. The gills are carried right behind the head, bordering the posterior margins of a series of openings from the esophagus to the exterior. Each gill is supported by a cartilaginous or bony gill arch. The gills of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx, along a series of gill slits opening to the exterior. Most species employ a counter-current exchange system to enhance the diffusion of substances in and out of the gill, with blood and water flowing in opposite directions to each other. The gills are composed of comb- like filaments, the gill lamellae, which help increase their surface area for oxygen exchange. When a fish breathes, it draws in a mouthful of water at regular intervals. Then it draws the sides of its throat together, forcing the water through the gill openings, so that it passes over the gills to the outside. The bony fish have three pairs of arches, cartilaginous fish have five to seven pairs, while the primitive jawless fish have seven. The vertebrate ancestor no doubt had more arches, as some of their chordate relatives have more than 50 pairs of gills. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes that have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. The high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only a small fraction of the dissolved oxygen that air does. A cubic meter of air contains about 250 grams of oxygen at STP. The concentration of oxygen in water is lower than air and it diffuses more slowly. In a litre of freshwater the oxygen content is 8 cm3 per litre compared to 210 in the same volume of air. Water is 777 times more dense than air and is 100 times more viscous. Oxygen has a diffusion rate in air 10,000 times greater than in water. The use of sac-like lungs to remove oxygen from water would not be efficient enough to sustain life. Rather than using lungs \\"Gaseous exchange takes place across the surface of highly vascularised gills over which a one-way current of water is kept flowing by a specialised pumping mechanism. The density of the water prevents the gills from collapsing and lying on top of each other, which is what happens when a fish is taken out of water.\\" Higher vertebrates do not develop gills, the gill arches form during fetal development, and lay the basis of essential structures such as jaws, the thyroid gland, the larynx, the columella (corresponding to the stapes in mammals) and in mammals the malleus and incus. Fish gill slits may be the evolutionary ancestors of the tonsils, thymus gland, and Eustachian tubes, as well as many other structures derived from the embryonic branchial pouches. Bony fish File:Fish gill respiration.jpgFish gill respiration File:Fish gill structure.jpgFish gill structure In bony fish, the gills lie in a branchial chamber covered by a bony operculum (branchia is an Ancient Greek word for gills). The great majority of bony fish species have five pairs of gills, although a few have lost some over the course of evolution. The operculum can be important in adjusting the pressure of water inside of the pharynx to allow proper ventilation of the gills, so that bony fish do not have to rely on ram ventilation (and hence near constant motion) to breathe. Valves inside the mouth keep the water from escaping. The gill arches of bony fish typically have no septum, so that the gills alone project from the arch, supported by individual gill rays. Some species retain gill rakers. Though all but the most primitive bony fish lack a spiracle, the pseudobranch associated with it often remains, being located at the base of the operculum. This is, however, often greatly reduced, consisting of a small mass of cells without any remaining gill-like structure. Fish transfer oxygen from the sea water to their blood using a highly efficient mechanism called countercurrent exchange. Countercurrent exchange means the flow of water over the gills is in the opposite direction to the flow of blood through the capillaries in the lamellae. The effect of this is that the blood flowing in the capillaries always encounters water with a higher oxygen concentration, allowing diffusion to occur all the way along the lamellae. As a result the gills can extract over 80% of the oxygen available in the water. Marine teleosts also use their gills to excrete osmolytes (e.g. Na⁺, Cl−). The gills' large surface area tends to create a problem for fish that seek to regulate the osmolarity of their internal fluids. Seawater contains more osmolytes than the fish's internal fluids, so marine fishes naturally lose water through their gills via osmosis. To regain the water, marine fishes drink large amounts of sea water while simultaneously expend energy to excrete salt through the Na+/K+-ATPase ionocytes (formerly known as mitochondrion-rich cells and chloride cells). Conversely, fresh water less osmolytes than the fish's internal fluids. Therefore, freshwater fishes must utilize their gill ionocytes to attain ions from their environment to maintain optimal blood osmolarity. In some primitive bony fishes and amphibians, the larvae bear external gills, branching off from the gill arches. These are reduced in adulthood, their function taken over by the gills proper in fishes and by lungs in most amphibians. Some amphibians retain the external larval gills in adulthood, the complex internal gill system as seen in fish apparently being irrevocably lost very early in the evolution of tetrapods.Clack, J. A. (2002): Gaining ground: the origin and evolution of tetrapods. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana. 369 pp Cartilaginous fish Six gill slits in a bigeyed sixgill shark; most sharks have only five Sharks and rays typically have five pairs of gill slits that open directly to the outside of the body, though some more primitive sharks have six or seven pairs. Adjacent slits are separated by a cartilaginous gill arch from which projects a long sheet-like septum, partly supported by a further piece of cartilage called the gill ray. The individual lamellae of the gills lie on either side of the septum. The base of the arch may also support gill rakers, small projecting elements that help to filter food from the water. A smaller opening, the spiracle, lies in the back of the first gill slit. This bears a small pseudobranch that resembles a gill in structure, but only receives blood already oxygenated by the true gills. The spiracle is thought to be homologous to the ear opening in higher vertebrates.Laurin M. (1998): The importance of global parsimony and historical bias in understanding tetrapod evolution. Part I-systematics, middle ear evolution, and jaw suspension. Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Zoologie, Paris, 13e Série 19: pp 1-42. Most sharks rely on ram ventilation, forcing water into the mouth and over the gills by rapidly swimming forward. In slow-moving or bottom dwelling species, especially among skates and rays, the spiracle may be enlarged, and the fish breathes by sucking water through this opening, instead of through the mouth. Chimaeras differ from other cartilagenous fish, having lost both the spiracle and the fifth gill slit. The remaining slits are covered by an operculum, developed from the septum of the gill arch in front of the first gill. The shared trait of breathing via gills in bony fish and cartilaginous fish is a famous example of symplesiomorphy. Bony fish are more closely related to terrestrial vertebrates, which evolved out of a clade of bony fishes that breathe through their skin or lungs, than they are to the sharks, rays, and the other cartilaginous fish. Their kind of gill respiration is shared by the \\"fishes\\" because it was present in their common ancestor and lost in the other living vertebrates. But based on this shared trait, we cannot infer that bony fish are more closely related to sharks and rays than they are to terrestrial vertebrates. Lampreys and hagfish Outline of a hagfish, showing above the two ventral openings (h) by which the water escapes from the gills, and in the dissection below the spherical pouches which contain the gills Lampreys and hagfish do not have gill slits as such. Instead, the gills are contained in spherical pouches, with a circular opening to the outside. Like the gill slits of higher fish, each pouch contains two gills. In some cases, the openings may be fused together, effectively forming an operculum. Lampreys have seven pairs of pouches, while hagfishes may have six to fourteen, depending on the species. In the hagfish, the pouches connect with the pharynx internally. In adult lampreys, a separate respiratory tube develops beneath the pharynx proper, separating food and water from respiration by closing a valve at its anterior end. Breathing without gills Although most fish respire primarily using gills, some fishes can at least partially respire using mechanisms that do not require gills. In some species cutaneous respiration accounts for 5 to 40 percent of the total respiration, depending on temperature. Cutaneous respiration is more important in species that breathe air, such as mudskippers and reedfish, and in such species can account for nearly half the total respiration. Fish from multiple groups can live out of the water for extended time periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, with the exception of the Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family. Breathing air is primarily of use to fish that inhabit shallow, seasonally variable waters where the water's oxygen concentration may seasonally decline. Fish dependent solely on dissolved oxygen, such as perch and cichlids, quickly suffocate, while air-breathers survive for much longer, in some cases in water that is little more than wet mud. At the most extreme, some air-breathing fish are able to survive in damp burrows for weeks without water, entering a state of aestivation (summertime hibernation) until water returns. Parasites on gills Monogenean parasite on the gill of a grouper Fish gills are the preferred habitat of many ectoparasites (parasites attached to the gill but living out of it); the most commons are monogeneans and certain groups of parasitic copepods, which can be extremely numerous.Kearn, G. C. (2004). Leeches, Lice and Lampreys. A natural history of skin and gill parasites of fishes. Dordrecht: Springer. Other ectoparasites found on gills are leeches and, in seawater, larvae of gnathiid isopods. Endoparasites (parasites living inside the gills) include encysted adult didymozoid trematodes,Pozdnyakov, S. E. & Gibson, D. I. (2008). Family Didymozoidae Monticelli, 1888. In R. A. Bray, D. I. Gibson & A. Jones (Eds.), Keys to the Trematoda, Vol. 3 (pp. 631-734). London: CAB International and The Natural History Museum. a few trichosomoidid nematodes of the genus Huffmanela, including Huffmanela ossicola which lives within the gill bone, and the encysted parasitic turbellarian Paravortex. Various protists and Myxosporea are also parasitic on gills, where they form cysts.

This film is remake of Tamil successful film Ko. The music directors of the film are Indradeep Dasgupta and Rishi Chanda.  Plot  The film begins with Abir (Ankush Hazra), a young, energetic photojournalist working for the private newspaper Anandabazar Patrika (ABP), witnessing Naxalites robbing a local bank. He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Naina (Srabanti Chatterjee) who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, Abir manages to secure the memory card of the camera. The cops catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer he shows the photos to them. The cops identify everyone in the photos except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, Abir again meets Nayana, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Payel (Sayani Ghosh) also works in his office and has feelings for Abir. However, Abir does not reciprocate her feelings and treats her only as a friend. Settled in her new job, Naina writes a cover story about the leader of the opposition Tarakeshwar Dutta (Supriyo Dutta), describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Tarakeshwar barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Naina. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Tarakeshwar), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Abir later risks his life to capture the pictures of Tarakeshwar who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Naina to fall in love with him, which Abir reciprocates. Payel is initially jealous of the love between Abir and Nayana, but later accepts it and gets over Abir. Meanwhile, Abhimanyu (Abir Chatterjee), a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to provide education and spread awareness to the poor people. He and his team of graduates try to contest against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No one cares about Abhimanyu and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is 'Borno Porichoy' (Grammar Introduction). One day, Abhimanyu gets attacked by some miscreants on the streets and he rushes towards the ABP office to get help. The attackers are thrown away by the office staffs and security. Abhimanyu tells the staff that those miscreants are from the ruling party and they have been sent by the Chief Minister Surojit Sarkar (Rajatava Dutta). Abir and Naina find out about Abhimanyu's election campaign, and they and the entire ABP team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Tarakeshwar and the Chief Minister. One night, Abhimanyu's party organises an election campaign meeting. Abir, photographing the event, receives a text message from Payel that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Abhimanyu is speaking. Abir manages to save Abhimanyu just before the bomb explodes. Later, Abir finds Payel fatally wounded near the blast site. Payel struggles to tell something to Abir and Naina before she dies. Abir, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, finds out that Payel was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robber and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Payel. A few days later, Naina notices that Abhimanyu's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Abir is also present. Confronted by Naina, Abir tells her that he and Abhimanyu studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Abhimanyu's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign. In the election, Abhimanyu's party wins by a huge majority and Abhimanyu becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 10 naxals on Republic Day, citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Abir rushes to the secretariat to meet Abhimanyu. In Abhimanyu's office, Abir notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Payel is sitting there, talking to Abhimanyu. Abir airs his grievances to Abhimanyu, who ignores him. Abir then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Abhimanyu orders the Kolkata Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place and start firing at the Naxalites. The Naxalite leader gets shot during the shooting and his group take hold of some people (including children) as hostage. Abir, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Shankar and finds out from him that Abhimanyu had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the child of a woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) in order to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Abhimanyu was speaking during his meeting. Payel had found out the truth about Abhimanyu, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Abir realises that Payel had tried to warn him and Naina about Abhimanyu's true character before dying and also that now Abhimanyu is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Abir records the confession of Shankar using his mobile phone camera sends it to Naina, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Abhimanyu then arrives outside the hideout and asks the police personnel to let him go inside alone and try to reason with the Naxalites. Abhimanyu goes inside and asks Shankar to kill Abir. Shankar refuses as Abir has saved his life by getting a Doctor for him to cure his wounds. Abhimanyu then kills Shankar. He also tries to kill Abir. However, Abir triggers a bomb there which explodes, killing Abhimanyu, while Abir manages to escape. Meanwhile, Abhimanyu's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Abhimanyu had died. Seeing their innocence, Abir forces Naina not to reveal the truth about Abhimanyu because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Abhimanyu. They did not know about Abhimanyu's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a 'healthy government'. Instead Naina publishes an article saying that Abhimanyu had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a martyr. The film ends with Abir and Nayana submitting their resignations to the Chief Editor for falsified reporting, but he rejects their resignations and tells them to cover the upcoming election.

Background Built in 1645, the church was constructed by wish of the Queen Regent Christine Marie of France to remember the miraculous rescue from the previous year of a girl from the river. The miracle was attributed to the intervention of an image of the Virgin of the Annunciation, which was placed on a votive pillar. The painting became such an item of devotion, that this church was built at the site, enlarged in 1779, and furnished with a baptistery in 1807. Repeated reconstructions have altered the interior, and the church retains only some of the original decoration consisting of the stuccoes attributed to Giovanni Andrea Casella and the cupola frescoes by Bartolomeo Guidobono. The main altar houses the miraculous icon dating from 1587, now thoroughly restored. Miracle The miracle for which the church was built recalls that the riverbank nearby once housed a number of mills. A flour miller's daughter fell into the river at dusk. Her Mother, hearing her cries, but unable to see where she was to rescue her, knelt before a nearby shrine built next to the mill, depicting the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin. Legend holds a miraculous shaft of light illuminated the spot where her daughter was, and allowed her to be rescued by neighbors. News of the miracle led to the erection of a church by 1645, which became a Parish church March 2, 1807. The picture of the Madonna behind the main altar recalls the event.

Life  thumb Heranush Arshagian was born in the Besiktas district of Constantinople in 1887. Her father Hagop, who died when she was 3, was a prominent social activist in the Armenian community. When Arshagian turned 10 years old, she entered the Bakirkoy French girls school. After studying there for a year and a half, Arshagian continued her studies at the Makruhian Armenian School in the Besiktas district. Arshagian's teachers were highly impressed by her essays and writings, but her days as a student were interrupted when her doctors suggested that she lived outside of the city. Arshagian moved to a farm on the outskirts of Yedikule, where she derived inspiration from the natural setting. It was during those years that Arshagian began to write poetry. She writes in her memoirs, \\"The fields are green. Afar I can see Constantinople with her ever-flowing suburbs. Beyond that are the hills and mountains covered in fog and the Marmara sea so very beautiful, so very trembling under the fiery rays of the sun...\\" Arshagian died in 1905 at the age of 18.  Poetry  She wrote a series of lyrical poems, novels, and short stories which were published after the author's death in Hayganush Mark's Tsaghig (Flower) newspaper.

Early life Miller was born in Derry, Ireland, the son of Captain Henry Miller, of H.M.'s 40th Regiment of Foot, who served with distinction in the Peninsular War, and was at the battle of Waterloo, and his wife Jane, née Morpeth. In 1823 Miller senior proceeded with a detachment of his regiment in charge of a batch of convicts to Sydney, his family accompanying him. Early career Shortly afterwards Miller senior was appointed commandant at Moreton Bay, where he spent eighteen months, and was then transferred to Van Diemen's Land, where he died at Hobart in 1866. After the arrival of the family in what was afterwards Tasmania, Miller junior obtained an appointment as an accountant in the audit office at Hobart, and at the age of twenty-four married Eliza, second daughter of the late Captain Mattinson of the Merchant Service. In 1839 Miller visited the Port Phillip District, and subsequently resigned his appointment in Tasmania, and came to Melbourne, where he settled at Richmond. He was one of the promoters of the Bank of Victoria, which was incorporated in October 1852, and was elected as the first chairman of directors, a post which he continued to occupy up till his death. He also originated a number of Insurance Companies and Building Societies. Political career On the separation of Port Phillip from New South Wales in 1851, Mr. Miller was elected to represent South Bourke, Evelyn and Mornington, in the original unicameral Victorian Legislative Council. In July 1852 Miller induced the Legislative Council to petition the Queen to authorise the establishment of a branch of the Royal mint in Melbourne. Miller supported the ballot, and on the inauguration of the constitution in 1856 he was returned to the Upper House for the Central province. On the formation of the first O'Shanassy Administration, in March 1858, Mr. Miller became Minister of Trade and Customs, and was sworn of the Executive Council, and elected to the Legislative Council for the Western province. In July 1866 he joined the first MᶜCulloch Ministry as Commissioner of Railways, but on going before his constituents he was defeated, and resigned office in January 1867, retiring thenceforward from public life. Miller was a most successful speculator in Melbourne property, and having conducted his investments with marvellous prudence, died on 7 February 1888, at his property Findon (built by Stephen Henty) in Kew, Melbourne, leaving enormous wealth. Family Henry Miller married Eliza Mattinson (died 5 April 1892), daughter of Captain Mattinson, on 11 November 1834. Their children included: *William Henry Miller (c. 1839 – 20 September 1915) was a noted businessman; he was connected with the Bank of Victoria and a director of the AMP Society. He married; they had four sons and five daughters. *Albert Miller (c. 1845 – 27 May 1915) *Sir Edward Miller (1848-1932), was a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for South Yarra Province 1892–1912. *Septimus Miller (1850 – 7 June 1925) The Miller brothers were famous horsemen, known for hunting and steeplechasing, closely associated with their property Mill Park and the horse Redleap.

It is often a complication in diabetes mellitus and other conditions affecting the nerves. Presentation A 47-year-old diabetic patient with profound peripheral neuropathy developed a blister on the plantar aspect of her right heel that became recalcitrant to conservative treatment. These ulcers have punched-out edge and slough in floor, resembling gummatous ulcer. Surrounding area might have loss of sensation. Cause This condition results from denervation of areas exposed to day-to-day friction of bony prominences. The denervation may be result of any of the following diseases: * Spinal injuries * Leprosy * Peripheral nerve injury * Diabetic neuropathy * Tabes dorsalis * Transverse myelitis * Meningomyelocele Pathophysiology Normal pressure and pain sensations are essential for protecting the foot from excessive and prolonged pressures over bony prominences. In insensitive foot, such as in diabetic neuropathy, soft tissues are exposed to excessive pressures without knowledge of the individual. In other words, by nerve damage in the feet, the patients get no feedback on the impact of the feet when walking. These ulcers start with callosity under which suppuration takes place. The pus comes out and a hole forms under which the lesion grows deeper. This leads to punched-out, painless ulcers usually under metatarsal heads, tip of toe, proximal interphalangeal joint of a hammertoe or on the heel. In non-ambulatory patients, these ulcers are found on buttocks and back of heel. Diagnosis Diagnosis is clinical. Sensation is tested using graded monofilament. Treatment Underlying cause of neuropathy is first treated. Necrotic portions of the wound are removed and wound is kept moist at all occasions. Infected ulcers are administered antibiotics. Skin grafting is one of the options. It has been shown that ultrasound may increase the acceptance of graft at trophic ulcer sites.

Façade History A church here is documented since the 14th century with the name of Sancti Ioannis de insula, and also Sancti Ioannis Cantofiume. But it is likely a church was established over the site of the temple of Iuppiter Iurarius. Armellini says the first church here was raised by the soldiers of Genseric and rebuilt in 464 by Peter, bishop of Porto, who held the jurisdiction of the Isola Tiberina. However the oldest documentary annotation of this church is found in a 1018 bull by Pope Benedict VIII. For centuries it was attached to the nearby Benedictine monastery. The present church was begun in 1584, atop the ruins of the older church. During this latter construction, the remains of the saint Giovanni Calibita, were putatively found under the main altar. The church was reconstructed in 1640, with the façade completed in 1711, and the rich interior painted decoration completed by 1742 by Corrado Giaquinto. The church contains an icon of the Madonna della lampada from the 13th century. This image traditionally was associated with a miracle: it was once at the river's edge with a votive lamp, however during the flood of 1557, while submerged, the fire in the lamp was not extinguished.

Founded by Dayle Gloria, the \\"Queen of the Sunset Strip\\" and Michael Stewart, Scream hosted many of the larger rock bands, such as Guns N' Roses, Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sisters of Mercy, 45 Grave, TSOL (True Sounds of Liberty) and Human Drama. It was considered one of the more influential clubs/outlets in L.A./Hollywood due to the signing of many of its of local musical group bookings to major label record companies and its hosting of many of the larger touring acts of the goth/industrial scene. Scream started in the fall of 1985 on Monday nights at the Seven Seas nightclub in Hollywood, where Mike Stewart and Dayle Gloria were DJ's. It then moved to Friday nights at the Berwin Entertainment Complex (now the site of the Hollywood Athletic Club) at 6525 Sunset Blvd, featuring two rooms: a dance floor with DJ on the left and a bar on the right featuring horror films projected on the wall. The décor in the dance room featured black toulle netting with images of Spanish Inquisition monks inspired by the 1961 Roger Corman film The Pit and the Pendulum, rendered with UV paints that glowed under the black lights. Fans blowing the netting made the images waver in a ghostly manner. These were created by Cleve Hall, subsequently known for the 2012 television show Monster Man on Syfy channel. Hall also coordinated the horror films projected in the bar area (as well as performed with his band Exquisite Corpse, featuring Sean Brennen of London After Midnight). Club owner Michael Stewart came up with the name based on the famous Edvard Munch painting and his best friend Steve Elkins created the logo. Advertising was largely based on unique illustrated flyers produced by \\"Mad\\" Marc Rude left on store counters throughout Hollywood. After being shut down by the Fire Marshal for being over capacity, Scream relocated in 1986 to the Embassy Hotel in downtown Los Angeles at 9th Street and Grand Avenue. While there it encompassed three floors of the building, including the basement, where it featured a stage with live bands in one room and horror films in the other. There was a long, narrow staircase which led to the basement, walls and stairs painted black which, due to the high probability of someone pitching headfirst down the stairs in darkness, was dubbed \\"The Descent into Hell\\" by clubgoers. The upper floors featured rooms with DJs and dance floors and a room where underground videos were projected. In the summer of 1987 Scream was kicked out of the Embassy Hotel, gathering around 4,000 \\"mourners\\" on closing night, and re-opened later the same year at the Park Plaza Hotel in the Wilshire District. Other acts to play Scream included Faith No More, Revolting Cocks, The Sugarcubes, Wiseblood, Lydia Lunch, Sea Hags, The Nymphs, Caterwaul, Living Colour, Specimen, and Christian Death. Scream was used as a shooting location for several 80s films, including the club scene in Less Than Zero and the club where Dr. & the Medics perform in Maid to Order, both 1987 releases. In 1987, Geffen Records released Scream: The Compilation, a collection of bands that had become staples at the club, including Jane's Addiction, Human Drama, and Kommunity FK.

Many states allow for criminal records to be sealed or expunged, although laws vary by state. Some states do not permit expungement, or allow expungement under very limited circumstances. In general, once sealed or expunged, all records of an arrest and of any subsequent court proceedings are removed from the public record, and the individual may legally deny or fail to acknowledge ever having been arrested for or charged with any crime which has been expunged. Federal Federal offenses are difficult to obtain expungement and vary based upon the federal circuit. Some federal circuits have upheld the inherent right of judges to order expungement while others have held the opposite.http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1163&context;=student_scholarship Most persons who have been convicted of federal offenses and who want relief from the consequences of the conviction are limited to seeking a pardon, but pardons are rarely granted. Legislation A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that would allow expungement of a federal criminal record, but none have become law. =Second Chance Act= U.S. Representative Charles B. Rangel (D-NY15) proposed the Second Chance Act in 2007, 2009, and 2011, which was intended to \\"[amend] the federal criminal code to allow an individual to file a petition for expungement of a record of conviction for a nonviolent criminal offense\\". =Fresh Start Act= U.S. Representative Steve Cohen (D-TN9) introduced H.R. 2449 or The Fresh Start Act of 2011 during the 112th Congress, which would have allowed certain non- violent offenders to seek expungement of otherwise lifelong felonies. =REDEEM Act= In July 2014, Senators Rand Paul and Cory Booker introduced the Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment (REDEEM) Act, a bi- partisan bill in an effort to reform the criminal justice system which would, in part, allow for the expungement of Federal criminal records for one time, non-violent offenses. State Expungement laws are different for each state. States do not necessarily have to give full effect to orders of expungement or record sealing from other states, provided that they treat all persons equally when considering the effect of a person's criminal history.  Alabama  Alabama passed expungement legislation in 2014. The law allows for expungement for multiple situations, with applications fees, court fees, and lawyers fees to be paid by the applicant. However, convictions are not eligible for expungement.  Arizona  Arizona's expungement equivalent is \\"setting aside\\" a conviction. Arizona's setting aside statuteArizona Revised Statutes (ARS) Section 13-907 allows a defendant to petition the court to have a conviction set aside after the terms of the sentence are met. If the court grants the petition, the defendant is \\"released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the conviction other than those imposed by the Department of Transportation.\\" The conviction can be used in any subsequent criminal prosecution.  California  California has several post- conviction remedies that are sometimes called expungement. For misdemeanor and felony crimes (not involving a sentence in state prison), a petition for expungement is filed in the court of conviction, seeking to have the conviction dismissed pursuant to Penal Code section 1203.4. For crimes involving a prison sentence, a petition for a Certificate of Rehabilitation (CR) is issued by the courts and filed with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Unlike an expungement, which is filed in the court of conviction, a petition for a Certificate of Rehabilitation is filed in the current county of residence. If the Certificate of Rehabilitation is granted, it automatically becomes an application for a pardon by the California Governor. Further, Penal Code 851.8 provides that defendants whose cases have been dismissed or who were never charged after arrest may petition for a Declaration of Factual Innocence. If granted, all records of arrest and prosecution are to be sealed for three years, then permanently obliterated. Copies of this order are sent to both the CA Department of Justice and the FBI. Those granted this remedy may legally deny being arrested in all instances as the arrest is deemed \\"never to have occurred\\" in the first place.  Colorado  Colorado law has recently been changed via Colorado HB 11-1167, which allows drug conviction to be sealed. This requires strict conditions to be met concerning the original violation and the time and behavior since the conviction. This is part of a greater movement by the Colorado Criminal Justic Reform Coalition (ccjrc.org) to create a way for forgiveness and redemption for people who have been convicted based on past drug convictions. Connecticut In the State of Connecticut, individuals within a certain age group are defined as \\"Youthful Offenders\\" and the majority of those convicted within the defined age limitations may have their criminal record erased under Sec. 54-76o of CHAPTER 960a.  Florida  Florida law allows for expungement of criminal records where the criminal case resulted in a dismissal by the court, a nolle prosequi (charges dropped) by the state attorney, or an acquittal by the judge or jury. Criminal records associated with cases receiving a final disposition of adjudication withheld are eligible for sealing in most but not all situations.Florida Department of Law Enforcement Seal and Expunge Process To be eligible for sealing or expungement, the defendant must not have been adjudicated guilty of any criminal offense, must not have previously received an expungement or sealing, and must not be in the process of obtaining another sealing or expungement in another court. =Eligibility= A Certificate of Eligibility from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is required prior to petitioning the court for an order to seal or expunge a record. An application to the FDLE must be completed and be accompanied with a certified disposition of the charge(s) seeking to be sealed or expunged. If an expungement is sought, the application to the FDLE must also be signed by the State Attorney attesting to the fact that the charges were dropped, dismissed, or that the person was found not guilty after trial. There is a $75.00 charge for the Certificate of Eligibility. After obtaining the required certificate of eligibility, the person then must file a petition to seal or expunge and attach the FDLE certificate of eligibility, an affidavit indicating that they are eligible for sealing or expungement, and a proposed order for the judge to sign if the petition is granted.Florida Department of Law Enforcement Seal and Expunge Process =Effect= The person who is the subject of a criminal history record that is expunged or sealed may lawfully deny or fail to acknowledge the arrests covered by the expunged record, except when the subject of the record: #Is a candidate for employment with a criminal justice agency; #Is a defendant in a criminal prosecution; #Concurrently or subsequently petitions for relief under the record sealing or expungement statutes; #Is a candidate for admission to The Florida Bar; #Is seeking to be employed or licensed by or to contract with the Department of Children and Families, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation within the Department of Education, the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Health, the Department of Elderly Affairs, or the Department of Juvenile Justice or to be employed or used by such contractor or licensee in a sensitive position having direct contact with children, the disabled, or the elderly; #Is seeking to be employed or licensed by the Department of Education, any district school board, any university laboratory school, any charter school, any private or parochial school, or any local governmental entity that licenses child care facilities; #Is seeking to be licensed by the Division of Insurance Agent and Agency Services within the Department of Financial Services; or #Is seeking to be appointed as a guardian pursuant to Florida Statute Section 744.3125.Florida Statute 943.0585  Georgia  Georgia law allows for \\"records restriction\\" which allows for the record of an incident to be restricted from the publicly available criminal records that the public are able to view. It does not allow for expungement in the traditional sense.  Illinois  Illinois law allows the sealing or expungement of parts of the records of a conviction.20 Illinois Compiled Statutes 2630 § 5 Sealing a conviction prevents the public, including employers, from gaining access to that record. To be eligible for sealing of a conviction record in Illinois one must have been sentenced to supervision. A waiting period of four years also is required, beginning at the time of discharge from supervision, where no convictions were entered. Some misdemeanors are ineligible for sealing. Effective January 1, 2014, many class 3 and 4 felonies are eligible for sealing.  Indiana  Indiana's Second Chance law, sponsored by Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, allows for the expungement of certain misdemeanor and felony offenses. Indiana Code 35-38-9-2 through 35-38-9-6 allows for the expungement of misdemeanors, and non-violent felonies. Crimes of a sexual nature are excluded from the law. A waiting period of 5 years is required for misdemeanors, as well as 8 years for a lesser felony. Ten years must have passed for more serious felonies. No charges must be pending against the individual and a fee must be paid to the clerk of the court. The individual's driver's license must not currently be suspended and they may not have a pending suspension. The person must have successfully completed their sentence, including any term of supervised release, and satisfied all other obligations placed on the person as part of the sentence. More serious felonies may require consent of the prosecutor.  Kentucky  Kentucky allows for the limited expungement of misdemeanor charges. For cases that were dismissed, or acquitted, an application for expungement can be made 60 days after the dismissal – KRS 431.076. The expungement of a misdemeanor conviction is permitted after five years after the completion of the sentence / probation if there have no further convictions during that time period, and certain other conditions have been met – KRS 431.078. Sex offenses, and crimes against children are not eligible for expungement. Kentucky requires that each person seeking an expungement obtain a certificate of eligibility from the Kentucky Court of Justice prior to petitioning for the expungement in the local court where the case was filed.  Missouri  Missouri has two forms of expungement, one generally applicable to criminal cases and a unique one for the crime of being a minor in possession of alcohol. If certain requirements are met, Missouri law allows a person to have an arrest record expunged, which the law of Missouri defines as the process of legally destroying, obliterating or striking out records or information in files, computers and other depositories relating to criminal charges.Chapter 610, Revised Statutes of Missouri (R.S.Mo.) Records expunged under this provision still may be opened to law enforcement if the person is charged with a subsequent offense or if any of the requirements of expungement no longer are met. In 2005, the Missouri General Assembly enacted a special new section in the state's Liquor Control Law allowing for the complete and total expungement for the offense of being a minor in possession of alcohol.Section 311.326, R.S.Mo. Unlike ordinary expungement, the MIP expungement exists with the explicit legislative mandate that the effect of an order of expungement under it \\"shall be to restore such person to the status occupied prior to such arrest, plea or conviction, as if such event had never happened.\\" Starting in 2018, Missouri will allow for the expungement of all non-Class A felonies and all misdemeanors, subject to exceptions for violent offenses, sex offenses, and other serious crimes, and for driving offenses involving liquor and commercial drivers licenses.  New Hampshire  New Hampshire statutes allow any person whose arrest has resulted in a finding of not guilty, or whose case was dismissed or not prosecuted, to petition for annulment of the arrest record at any time, free of charge. Any person who has been convicted may petition for annulment after he/she has completed all requirements of their sentence, including probation, and paid a $100 fee to the department of corrections to cover the cost of an investigation into the criminal history of the petitioner: * For a violation, one year, unless the underlying conviction was for an offense specified under habitual offender law. * For a class A or B misdemeanor excluding sexual assault, 3 years. * For a class B felony other than incest or endangering the welfare of a child by solicitation, 5 years. * For a class A felony, 10 years. * For sexual assault, 10 years. * For felony indecent exposure or lewdness, 10 years. The person whose record is annulled shall be treated in all respects as if he had never been arrested, convicted or sentenced, except that, upon conviction of any crime committed after the order of annulment has been entered, the prior conviction may be considered by the court in determining the sentence to be imposed, and may be counted toward habitual offender status. In any application for employment, license or other civil right or privilege, or in any appearance as a witness in any proceeding or hearing, a person may be questioned about a previous criminal record only in terms such as \\"\\"Have you ever been arrested for or convicted of a crime that has not been annulled by a court?''  New Jersey  New Jersey statutes allow expungement of conviction of many indictable offenses, disorderly persons offenses, municipal ordinances, and juvenile adjudications. With the exception of applicants who have graduated from a \\"special drug probation,\\" the statutes disallow expungement for convictions if the applicant has been convicted of two or more indictable offenses,N.J.S. 2C:52-2 or four or more disorderly persons offenses.N.J.S. 2C:52-3 Effective October 1, 2018, however, different crimes all reflected on a single judgment of conviction, or that occurred close in time and are related or interdependent can be grouped and counted as a single crime for expungement purposes. If the applicant has a combination of one criminal conviction and up to three disorderly persons convictions, both the criminal conviction and disorderly persons convictions can be expunged after the waiting period has been satisfied. An unlimited number of disorderly persons convictions can be expunged provided that there are no criminal convictions, and the convictions for all of the disorderly persons offenses occurred on the same day. Until October 1, 2018, persons who had an indictable charge dismissed on account of a diversion could not thereafter have a criminal or disorderly persons conviction expunged.N.J.S. 2C:52-14(f) Effective October 1, 2018, that bar vanished. No number-of-conviction limitations are imposed for persons who have satisfied drug court \\"special probation\\" provided that they have had no subsequent criminal, disorderly persons, or petty disorderly persons convictions. Those who enter a Pre-Trial Intervention (PTI) or Conditional Discharge are eligible to apply to have the indictment and program record expunged six months after completion of the program. The ″normal″ waiting period before an indictable conviction can be expunged is six years, five years for disorderly offenses, and two years for municipal ordinances. In 2010, the waiting period on indictable convictions was lowered to five years. On April 18, 2016, the waiting period for disorderly persons offenses was lowered to three years. However, applicants who have not waited the full six years for indictable offenses, or the full five years for disorderly persons offenses, must satisfy the judge that granting the expungement is in the public interest. No such showing need be made once the full six (or five) years have elapsed. N.J.S.A. 2C:52-7 states that under certain circumstances some individuals may qualify for an early pathway expungement. An early pathway expungement allows a person to isolate part or all of their record in less time: five years for a felony, three years for a disorderly person’s offense. However, an early expungement has stricter criteria, not the least of which is that the defendant must prove that the early expungement is in the public interest. Waiting periods begin to run on the date of sentencing, the date all fines are paid, or the completion date of probation or parole, whichever occurs last. Expungements can be granted when not all fines have been paid provided that the failure to pay was not willful. There is no waiting period for most dismissals and acquittals.N.J.S. 2C:52-6(a) However, if the dismissal arose on account of a diversion, there is a six-month waiting period.N.J.S. 2C:52-6b If the acquittal resulted from a finding of insanity or lack of mental capacity, records of the arrest cannot be expunged.N.J.S. 2C:52-6(c) Traffic offenses cannot be expunged.N.J.S. 2C:52-28 However, records of arrests and convictions for disorderly persons offenses that are defined in Title 39 (traffic statutes) can be expunged. Expungements give the person the legal right to state, even under oath, that the event never occurred. Civil disabilities associated with the conviction are eliminated. However, expunged records must still be recited in certain situations. These situations include applications for employment with a law enforcement agency, applications for employment in the judicial system, applications for admission to the bar, and applications for a subsequent expungement. Moreover, jurisdictions outside New Jersey are not required to recognize the relief granted by a New Jersey expungement White v. Thomas, 660 F.2d 680, 685 (5th Cir., 1981), cert. den., 455 U.S. 1027 (1982). Records expunged after completion of \\"Special Probation\\" (see first paragraph, above) can be unexpunged if the person is thereafter convicted of another criminal, disorderly persons, or petty disorderly persons offense.  New York  New York Criminal Procedure Law 160.50 permits the \\"sealing\\" of cases where charges were dismissed, vacated, set-aside, not filed, or otherwise terminated. Otherwise, New York does not allow expungements, or \\"sealings,\\" of cases where a conviction was entered, except for some older controlled substance, marijuana, and loitering offenses. Sealing a record under 160.50 will prevent the public from having access or seeing the records, including fingerprint cards, photographs, court entries, and other information related to the case. The record may still be made available to some entities, such as courts and law enforcement. New York also permits the expungements of non- criminal dispositions (violations and traffic infractions, such as disorderly conduct) through New York Criminal Procedure Law 160.55. Misdemeanor and felony adjudications are not eligible. Pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure § 160.58, a petitioner convicted of most felony drug, marijuana, or Willard non-drug eligible crimes may request to have their records for those crimes sealed if they successfully complete DIVERSION, DTAP, or a similar substance abuse treatment program recognized by the court. The sealing will also extend to up to three of the petitioners misdemeanor drug convictions. Under New York Criminal Procedure § 160.59, subject to exceptions for sex offenses, Class A felonies and violent felonies, following a ten year waiting period that begins on the later of a defendant's date of conviction or release from prison, courts have discretion to seal up to two convictions, only one of which may be a felony. Sealed records remain available to law enforcement and some licensing agencies are not available to the public. The law prohibits all employers and public licensing agencies from asking about convictions sealed under this law, or from taking adverse action based upon a sealed conviction. The 2010 amendment to New York Criminal Procedure Law Article 440 creates a specific mechanism for survivors of trafficking to vacate prior prostitution convictions if the acts were committed as a result of having been trafficked. The law now provides, in relevant part, that a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction may be granted where: \\"...the arresting charge was under section 240.37 (loitering for the purpose of engaging in a prostitution offense, provided that the defendant was not alleged to be loitering for the purpose of patronizing a prostitute or promoting prostitution) or section 230.00 (prostitution) of the penal law, and the defendant’s participation in the offense was a result of having been a victim of sex trafficking under section § 230.34 of the New York Penal Law or trafficking in persons under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\\" C.P.L. § 440.10(i) (2009) (effective Aug. 13, 2010). See http://www.sexworkersproject.org/downloads/2012/20120422-memo- vacating-convictions.pdf  North Carolina  North Carolina's expungement statute, allows for one adult expungement per lifetime. Cases in which there was a dismissal of charges or a finding of not guilty can be expungement once the judgement is entered. Non-violent Class H and I felonies and non-violent misdemeanors can be expunged 15 years after completion of sentence. Exceptions are for drug related charges that involve methamphetamines or heroin, or possession with intent to sell and deliver or sell or deliver cocaine. Offenses that include inclusion of a registry such as the sex offender registry are non-expungible.  Ohio  Ohio is a \\"sealing\\" stateOhio Revised Code 2953.32 Sealing allows eligible offenders to petition the court for the sealing of a conviction record, or the record of a case resulting in an acquittal, no-bill, or dismissal of the criminal charges.Ohio Revised Code 2953.52 To be eligible to have a conviction sealed, one must have no pending criminal charges, and have been convicted of not more than one felony, two misdemeanors, or one felony and one misdemeanor, other than multiple offenses which arose from the same act, or that were adjudicated in the same proceeding where the criminal acts occurred within a three month period of each other.Ohio Revised Code 2953.31 Minor misdemeanor convictions are not considered for purposes of determining who is an eligible offender, nor are traffic convictions except for those offenses specifically included by statute, examples of which include as driving under suspension and operating a vehicle while intoxicated.Ohio Revised Code 2953.31 (A) To seal the records of a conviction, a defendant must first complete all terms of the sentence imposed in the case sought to be sealed, including the payment of all fines, but exclusive of court costs and restitution obligations, and the completion of all terms of incarceration, probation, and other sanctions imposed as part of the sentence in the case. A convicted offender is eligible to petition the sentencing court for the sealing of the records of the case after one year has passed from the date the defendant completed their sentence in a misdemeanor case or three years in cases that resulted in a felony conviction. There is no waiting period in the case of criminal proceedings that resulted in an acquittal or dismissal with prejudice, however; where a no bill is returned by a grand jury as to an individual, or the proceedings against them are dismissed without prejudice, they are ineligible to petition for the records of the case to be sealed until two years have passed from the date it was returned. Convictions for certain offenses are ineligible for sealing, including many sexual offenses, crimes against children, felonies of the first and second degree, and offenses for which a mandatory term of imprisonment applies,Ohio Revised Code 2953.36 however; proceedings terminated by acquittal or dismissal with prejudice are not subject to this limitation.Id. cf. Ohio Revised Code 2953.36 Where a prosecution is terminated by a dismissal without prejudice, but the statute of limitations has not yet expired for every dismissed charge, the Ohio Courts of Appeal are in conflict as to whether the defendant is eligible to have the case sealed. While the plain language of the statutes does not require the expiration of the statute of limitations prior to entry of an order sealing the records of a dismissed case, as recognized by several Ohio Courts of Appeal, at least one Appellate Court has ruled otherwise.State v. Dye, 2016-Ohio-5065, 2016 Ohio App. LEXIS 2871 (Ohio Ct. App., Fairfield County July 21, 2016) This case has been certified as creating a conflict among the Ohio Courts of Appeal which will be resolved by the Ohio Supreme Court.State v. Dye, 147 Ohio St. 3d 1436, 2016-Ohio-7677, 63 N.E.3d 155 (Nov. 9, 2016)  Oklahoma  Oklahoma allows for four different types of criminal records expungement under Oklahoma Statue Title 22 – Criminal Procedure. Section 18 Expungement allows for the sealing of certain nonviolent felonies and misdemeanors. These records are still accessible by court order but are sealed from the public. Expungement under Section 19a allows for the expungement of criminal history if a person was the victim of identity theft and used that stolen identity to commit a crime. Section 60.18 Expungement allows for the expungement of Victim Protective Orders. Section 991(c) Expungement is available if a person has been given a deferred sentence and the conditions of the deferred sentence have been met. Immediate court records will be sealed under Section 991(c) but the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation will show that a person \\"plead not guilty, case dismissed.\\"  Oregon  A person who has been arrested may petition for the set-aside of non-conviction records one year after the date of arrest, or any time following an acquittal or dismissal of charges. For adult offenders, a conviction for a less serious, nonviolent misdemeanor or felony offense may be set aside after a waiting period of between one and twenty years, provided that the person seeking relief from the conviction has no other convictions within the most recent ten years, or arrests within the past three years. Oregon has more generous expungement policies for convictions for marijuana offenses. An order setting aside a conviction restores all rights, relieves all disabilities, and also seals records of the conviction. Expungement and sealing of juvenile records is possible following the juvenile offender's reaching the age of 18, after a five year waiting period.  Tennessee  TCA 40-32-101 is the statute and provides some expungements at no cost. TCA 40-32-101(a)(1)(A) All public records of a person who has been charged with a misdemeanor or a felony shall, upon petition by that person to the court having jurisdiction in the previous action, be removed and destroyed without cost to the person, if: The charge has been dismissed, a no true bill was returned by a grand jury, a verdict of not guilty was returned, whether by the judge following a bench trial or by a jury, the person was arrested and released without being charged. TCA 40-32-101(a)(1)(B) A person applying for the expunction of records because the charge or warrant was dismissed in any court as a result of the successful completion of a pretrial diversion program pursuant to §§ 40-15-102 — 40-15-107, shall be charged the appropriate court clerk's fee pursuant to § 8-21-401 for destroying such records. TCA 40-32-101(a)(3) Upon petition by a defendant in the court that entered a nolle prosequi in the defendant's case, the court shall order all public records expunged. TCA 40-32-101(a)(5) All public records concerning an order of protection [ex-parte, exparte] authorized by title 36, chapter 3, part 6, which was successfully defended and denied by the court following a hearing conducted pursuant to § 36-3-605, shall, upon petition by that person to the court denying the order, be removed and destroyed without cost to the person.  Texas  Texas expungement law allows expungement of arrests which did not lead to a finding of guilt, and class C misdemeanors if the defendant received deferred adjudication, and completed community supervision.TCCP Chapter 55 If the defendant was found guilty, pleaded guilty, or pleaded no contest to any offense other than a class \\"C\\" misdemeanor, it is not eligible for expungement; however, it may be eligible for non-disclosure if deferred adjudication was granted.  Utah  Utah's expungement is set forth in Utah Statute 77-18-2. In essence, first degree crimes cannot be expunged. Second degree forceable crimes cannot be expunged. Crimes other than those can.  Washington  Washington's expungement equivalent is called \\"vacating a judgment.\\" It allows the court to vacate certain felony convictions which occurred after July 1, 1984.Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 9.94A.640 Revised Code of Washington (RCW) Chapter 9.94A.640 allows the court to withdraw the finding of guilt and vacate a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor.RCW Chapter 9.96 Once vacated, or expunged, the person's criminal record will not include that case. State law gives the person the right to state to anyone, including prospective employers, that the person was not convicted of that offense, after a vacate motion has been granted. Caveats Immigration  For purposes of immigration, unless a pardon or an expungement was granted on the basis of factual innocence, the USCIS will continue to treat an expunged or sealed record as a criminal conviction. In reviewing the character and fitness of an immigrant along the different steps from permanent residency to citizenship, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services looks to see if the petitioner has ever been convicted of a crime.Immigration Consequences Manual, chapter 4, prepared by the North Carolina Office of Indigent Defense Services, http://www.ncids.org/Other%20Manuals/Immigration%20Manual/Text.htm Even if the immigrant was convicted, made restitution, and as part of a plea agreement had the court record expunged, that initial conviction will still appear on the immigrant's record and the immigrant may well find him/herself in deportation proceedings (as was the case of Padilla v. Kentucky (2010)). In Padilla, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Padilla has received ineffective assistance of counsel because he had not been warned of the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea.https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-651.pdf Security clearance When applying for a state professional license or job that is considered a public office or high security (such as security guard, law enforcement, or related to national security), you may be required to disclose that you have an expunged conviction. A false denial may result in the denial of a license or security clearance.

This initial system amounted to binding over some first-time offenders, without supervision by probation staff, and applied chiefly to young offenders. Reforms and extension to adult offenders were considered but not implemented under British rule, although a form of \\"probational release\\" or parole from longer prison sentences was introduced in the then province of Punjab in 1926. The current probation system originates from legislation introduced in independent Pakistan in 1960. This provides two alternatives to a prison sentence: conditional discharge or a probation order. Probation may apply to convicts of any age, but is excluded in the case of specified serious offences. The court's decision on the suitability of probation is informed by reports from the police and probation service. The probation order requires that the subject is bound-over not to re-offend, and places him or her under the supervision of a probation officer for between one and three years, sometimes with extra conditions on place of residence and other behaviours. Further legislation in 2000 expands the role of the probation service in investigating the cases of young offenders. Parole continues as a separate system.  British India  Prior to Pakistan's Independence in August 1947, Pakistan was part of British India. As the system of probation was established in Europe, the British colonial rulers amended the Code of Criminal Procedure (India) 1898 (Act V) in 1923 by the insertion of sections 380 and 562 to 564, introducing the concept of probation to the Indian Subcontinent.The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 1923 (18 of 1923) These new sections provided for the release of offenders \\"on probation of good conduct\\" but failed to make provision for any system of supervision. The insertions were also restricted to the first-offenders and confined to some extent with respect to the legal character of the offense, provision being made for more liberal application of the measure in respect of minors and women.Section 380, and Sections 562 to 564, The Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (No V) The procedure provided by the amending legislation in 1923 involved the release of offenders on their entering into a bond, without sureties; to appear for sentence when called upon during a period, not exceeding three years, as determined by the court; and \\"in the meantime to keep the peace and be of good behavior\\".Section 380, The Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 (No V) The Code's section 562, which now stands repealed under the Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960,Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV). provided the Court with various alternatives while dealing with a juvenile offender. These options included whipping; imposition of fine or security; treatment under section 31 of the Reformatory Schools Act 1897 (No VIII);British Probation of Offenders Act 1907 detention in a reformatory school; or ordering imprisonment. Some High Courts recommended to the concerned magistrates that if the offender was not convicted of murder or any other flagrant offense and did not show any marked criminal tendencies, then the courts should make free use of the section 562 provisions. The magistrates were asked to refrain from sending boys of tender age to the Borstal institutions or Reformatory Schools. Young boys were considered out of place in Borstal institutions because they are likely to interact with older boys up to the age of 21 years in such institutions. During the years following the amendments of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1923,Anees Jillani, “Cries Unheard”. the introduction of probation legislation for adult offenders on the lines of the British Probation of Offenders Act 1907, Good Conduct Prisoners Probationer Release Act by Government of Punjab in 1926. also repeatedly came under consideration. Ultimately in 1930, the Government of British India announced its intention to do so. In 1931 an All-India Probation Bill was drafted by the British and circulated to the Provincial Governments for their review. However, the bill never became a law partly due to lack of interest on the part of the rulers and partially due to the political upheaval that the whole country was undergoing at that time. Nevertheless, during the period 1930 to 1940, several Provinces of British India like Bengal, Bombay, Punjab, Madras, Nagpur, and the United Provinces, perhaps inspired by this draft bill, made statutory provisions for the probation system on Provincial basis.  The Good Conduct Prisoners Probational Release Act  The Government of the Punjab in 1926 passed the Good Conduct Prisoners Probational Release Act. It provided protection as well as guidance to the prisoner for his readjustment and rehabilitation in a free life. This system worked well and was adopted by the Government of West Pakistan in 1957. But its provision had a limited scope in that it failed to apply to cases involving short-term sentences, ranging from one month or less to one year. Secondly, the provisions of the Act could be availed of only by those convicted persons who had already gone through the rigors of prison life and thus had already been tainted with the stigma of spending time in prison. The Reclamation and Probation Department of the then West Pakistan Province prepared two draft legislations on an all-Pakistan basis to introduce the concept of probation in the country but could not introduce these laws in the Parliament for reasons best known to the then Governments.  The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV)  Eventually, it was the martial law government of Ayub Khan that introduced Pakistan's first probation law in the shape of the Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) at the Federal level. The law extended to the whole of Pakistan; and was notified to come into force effective July 1, 1961 for the Province of West Pakistan.Section 1 The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV), Section 1. The law was the first of its kind in Pakistan, and is still in force. The 1960 Ordinance provides for two kinds of relief for the offenders which covers juveniles as well. In the first instance, the offender could be conditionally discharged or alternatively, he or she could be released on probation.  Conditional Discharge  An order for conditional discharge could be given either after a simple due admonition, or by making an order discharging him or her subject to the condition that the offender enters into a bond, with or without sureties,section 4 The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) for committing no offense and observing good behavior during such period not exceeding one year from the date of the order.section 4(b), The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) Such an order could be made in respect of a person who had not been previously convicted, and is now convicted by the court for an offense punishable with imprisonment not exceeding two years. The court in this regard is required to look into the offender's age, character, antecedents and physical or mental condition; and the nature of the offense or any extenuating circumstances attending the commission of the offense. Before making an order for conditional discharge, the court should also explain to the offender in ordinary language that if he or she commits any offense or does not remain of good behavior during the period of conditional discharge he or she could be liable to be sentenced for the original offense. Where a person who is conditionally discharged is sentenced for the offense in respect of which the order for conditional discharge was made, that order ceases to have effect. This provision relating to conditional discharge is useful in offenses of trivial nature or where the offense is committed under peculiar circumstances where no punishment is warranted or the crime involved is such that it is not expedient to place the person on probation or the court is of the opinion that probation would unnecessarily burden the work of a probation officer, particularly at the cost of the other probationers who deserve such handling.Section 5, The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) While this provision permits in suitable cases the absolute discharge with admonition of an offender, it provides for other cases where the court may consider necessary in view of the circumstances of the case to bind the offender with a bond, with or without sureties, not to commit any offense and to be of good behavior during such period not exceeding a year. If the offender fails to observe any of the conditions of his or her bond, the court can issue a warrant for his or her arrest and can also summon the offender and the sureties.Section 7 The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) Upon the offender appearing in the court, the court can either remand the offender to judicial custody until the case is heard or admit him or her to bail. After hearing the case, the court can sentence the offender for the original offense; or impose upon the offender a fine not exceeding Rs 1,000.  Supervision of a Probation Officer  A court is also empowered under this law to make a probation order in certain cases. Instead of sentencing the person, the court can, for reasons recorded in writing, can place him or her under the supervision of a probation officer for a maximum period of three years and for a minimum period of one year.Section 5(b)The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) However, malesSection 5(a) The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) convicted of an offense under chapters VI or VII of the Pakistan Penal Code 1860 (No XLV), or under certain specified sections of the PPCSection 216-A, 328, 382, 386, 387, 388, 389, 392, 393, 397, 398, 399, 401, 402, 455 , 458 or an offense punishable with death or transportation for life; or females. convicted of an offense punishable with death are not entitled to probation under the 1960 Ordinance. The court, however, cannot pass a probation order unless the offender enters into a bond, with or without sureties, pledging not to commit an offense and to keep the peace and be of good behavior during the period of the bond; and to appear and receive sentence if called upon to do so during that period. The court also should not pass a probation order unless it is satisfied that the offender or one of his sureties, if any, has a fixed place of abode or a regular occupation within the local limits of its jurisdiction and is likely to continue in such place of abode or such occupation, during the period of the bond. The court can also direct that the bond should contain such conditions, as in its opinion, are necessary for securing supervision of the offender by the probation officer; and also such additional conditions with respect to residence, environment, abstention from intoxicants and any other matter which the court may, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, consider necessary for preventing a repetition of the same offense or a commission of other offenses by the offender and for rehabilitating him as an honest, industrious and law-abiding citizen.Section 5(2) The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) If an offender is sentenced for the offense in respect of which a probation order was made, then the probation order ceases to have effect.Section 5(3) The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV)  Age and health considerations  The provisions of the 1960 Ordinance do not take into consideration factors like age and health. It does not, however, mean that juvenile offenders are not entitled to probation. It simply implies that the court is not expected to take this account as a factor justifying grant of probation. Health is excluded as a category firstly, because the lawmakers were of the opinion that the probation itself is hardly suitable to cases involving ill-health, physical or mental; and secondly because proper and elaborate medical facilities may not be available to the machinery of the probation administration in Pakistan for some time to come. However, these factors can be taken into account at the time of discharging a criminal. In addition to discharging an offender or making a probation order the court can order the offender to pay compensation or damages for losses caused to any person by the offender. However, the amount of compensation or damages and costs so awarded should not exceed the amount of the fine which the court could have imposed in respect of the original offense committed by the offender.Section 6 The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV)  Grave offenses not entitled to probation  Male persons convicted of grave offenses are not entitled to probation., like those punishable with the penalty of death or transportation for life or of heinous offenses of the nature, as described in the PPC under sections 216-A (penalty for harboring robbers or dacoits), 311 (for being a thug), 328 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 386-389 (putting a person in fear of injury or death in order to commit extortion, etc.), 392-402 (commitment of robbery, dacoity or belonging to gang of thieves), 413 (habitual dealing in stolen property), 455 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking after preparation for hurt or assault, etc.), 460 (all persons jointly concerned in lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night punishable where death or grievous hurt caused by one of them), or of serious offenses under Chapters VI (Offenses against the State) and VII (offenses relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force). This bar is introduced in the 1960 Ordinance more or less on the lines of the Good Conduct Prisoners Probational Release Act 1926, which was already in force in Pakistan when the 1960 law was introduced. A total bar with regard to section 302 and 303 and partial bar with regard to section 307 of the PPC is also provided, as section 5 restricts the application of the Ordinance in respect of a male person convicted of an offense punishable with death or transportation for life. In fact, in the matter of offense, the scope of the Ordinance is limited to a greater degree than that of the 1926 Act in that it precludes wholesale the offenses punishable with transportation of life against the latter law which covered offenses under certain sections such as 304, 305 and 326 of the PPC. With regard to females, no restriction is made with regard to offenses other than an offense punishable with death for availing the benefits under the Ordinance.  Investigation by Probation Officer  While considering the use of probation, the 1960 Ordinance enjoins the court to take into consideration all the pros and cons of a case and consider the version of the prosecuting agency as well as go into the report of the probation officer before taking any final decision. The reports made by the police in this respect can be a valuable guide to the court, particularly on the question of previous offenses. However, investigation done by the probation officer is more helpful since it is expected to cover the circumstances or home surroundings of any offender with a view to assisting the court in determining the suitable methods of dealing with the offender. The probation officer's report should inform the court about the offender as an individual; about offender's family and home background, his work and capabilities, his interests and associates, his character and disposition, and his health and mental outlook. The information collected by the probation officer, however, is made available to the court only after the establishment of the guilt of the offender and cannot, therefore, affect offender's conviction; it is expected to only influence court's disposition with respect to grant of probation. The whole purpose of the investigation conducted by the officer is to strengthen the hands of the court in dealing with the individual offender, and to enable the court to know something of the offender's personality and relation to society, to consider his needs and potentialities and thus be in a position to decide as to whether it would in the offender's interest and the community's interest if the concerned individual is placed on probation. If the court decides that a particular case is fit for probation and passes a probation order, the offender is then placed under the supervision of a probation officer.Section 12 Appointment of a Probation officer, The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) It is then for the officer to undertake the task of helping the probationer to make a success of his probation. It then becomes the concerned officer's duty to advise, assist and befriend the probationer. The officer is expected to look into the probationer's immediate material needs, such as searching for employment and accommodation for the offender. Even while the officer is attending to these needs, however, he or she should try to decide in what ways and for what reasons the probationer is maladjusted in the society. It is important for probation to succeed that the change instead of being imposed from outside come from the probationer. During the probation period the probation officer is expected to develop a relationship with the probationer,section 13 Duties of a Probation Officer, The Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1960 (No XLV) with a view to enabling the offender to differentiate between right and wrong and to lead a useful and law-abiding life. The technique of building the relationship between the two is mainly based on the probation officer's precept and example, reinforced with his or her dynamic personality. Success consists in making the probationer look at things from a perspective which he or she was unlikely to do without the probation officer's help. The probationer may be kept in his home during the period of probation or elsewhere in a better and healthier environment as required by the court on the merits of each case. If there are no definite directions to this effect in a particular case, this matter can be left to the discretion of the probation officer and the Probation Department. The question of engaging or employing the probationer on any congenial work or useful trade can be left to the advice and discretion of the probation officer and the Probation Department. Breach of conditions If a probationer breaches any of the conditions of his or her probation, but is not involved in the commission of fresh offense, three ways are open to the court: \\\\- It can amend the probation order, insert new requirements, but not extend it beyond the statutory maximum limit of three years. \\\\- It can punish the offender for breach of probation order by levying a fine of up to Rs 1,000; or \\\\- If the fine is not paid within such period as fixed by the court, the offender may be sentenced for the original offense. If the offender also commits a fresh offense, then the court, apart from sentencing the offender for the new offense, should also punish the offender for the original offense. The 1960 Ordinance envisages that normally a probation officer should be able to report to court in about 2,000 cases a year and also to be able to supervise about 50 cases of probationers at a time and sometimes even more. When the work of any particular court is not reasonably sufficient to justify the appointment of a full-time officer, one officer can be entrusted with the task to cover two or more courts. A probation officer is expected to investigate and report about the offense and the circumstances under which it took place together with the general conduct and character of the offender including his or her socio-economic background. This will, however, be done by the court only in the few chosen cases which will be selected for the purpose by the court.  The Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000  This Ordinance was introduced by the General Musharraf regime on July 1, 2000 which was repleaed by virtue of Act No.XXII of 2018 namely Juvenile Justice System Act 2018 and was a pioneer law in protecting the rights of juveniles coming into conflict with law in more than one ways. Like previous law i.e JJSO 2000 this law also extends to the whole of Pakistan.  Parole  In addition to the system of conditional discharge and probation envisaged under the 1960 Ordinance, there also exists the system of parole in Pakistan's judicial system. It is different from probation in that the parolees are first sent to prison and then given early release. Parolees are those who in the opinion of the jail authorities are likely to refrain from crime and lead an enterprising life. In this way they are categorized as falling into the category of those prisoners who have not formed definite criminal tendencies. They are thus placed under the supervision of a parole officer, and sent as servants to influential officers and paid meager salaries by them. In many ways, the whole system smacks of bonded labor. Generally, the parolees are seldom taught any skills to get better jobs. Like everything associated with the prison system in the country, the system of parole and probation is in a pathetic state in Pakistan. They are run by Directors in Punjab and Sindh while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, they are headed by IG Prisons and by the Home Secretary respectively. More attention needs to be paid to this community based rehabilitation because it will prove to be less expensive. According to one estimate, Pakistan presently is spending around Rs 800 million on prisons annually. If the probation and parole system is used constructively then the expenditure could be reduced to about Rs 70 million per year. Figures In 2012, the numbers of prisoners released on probation were as follows: Punjab: Juveniles - 164 Females - 350 Adult Males - 22,235 Sindh: Juveniles - 44 Females - 2 Adult Males - 695 In 2012, the numbers released on parole were as follows: Punjab: Juveniles - 0 Females - 0 Adult Males - 327 Sindh: Juveniles - 0 Females - 0 Adult Males - 29  References  Category:Pakistani law Category:Punishments by country Pakistan ","title":"Probation in Pakistan"},{"id":"37926475","text":"Harry Hall was an English footballer who played as an inside-forward for Southampton in the Southern League in 1915.

It was founded in 1971 as a college for technology, business and social work. Today the university is one of the largest institutions of applied sciences in Bavaria. Its eight faculties offer 24 Bachelor's degree programs, 13 Master's degree studies as well as five postgraduate courses. Emphasis is laid on Engineering Science (incl. Computer Science) and Law, Economic and Social Sciences.https://ranking.zeit.de/che/en/hochschule/402 History Beginnings The history of Regensburg University of Applied Sciences goes back to the middle of 19th century, when the private drawing teacher Johann Dörner founded a private school for construction and plan drawing in 1846. In 1868 this school was united with the \\"königlich bayerische Realschule\\" in Regensburg which can be translated as Royal Bavarian Highschool to offer education in construction professions beyond regular school education. A few decades later in 1953 it was transformed and renamed into the so-called \\"Bauschule für Hoch- und Tiefbau\\" (). Birth of Johannes-Kepler- Polytechnikum Because of raising numbers of students in Regensburg, the government of Oberpfalz decided to expand the educational offers of the Bauschule in Regensburg. As a result of this the faculties of mechanical engineering and electrical engineering were founded in 1958. From now on the school was known as Johannes-Kepler-Polytechnikum, named after the famous German mathematician Johannes Kepler. Foundation of the Fachhochschule Regensburg The campus In 1964 the responsibility for the Johannes-Kepler- Polytechnikum was given from the government of Oberpfalz to the government of Bavaria. The government of Bavaria decidet in 1971 to create another typ of university beside the already existing one. So the model of Fachhochschule was developed. In this process the Johannes-Kepler-Polytechnikum was merged with some smaller schools for business and engineering around Regensburg and the Fachhochschule Regensburg was finally founded. As a result of this more studies could be offered and business studies, computer sciences and social sciences were added to the catalogue of subjects. The Fachhochschule Regensburg was and still is the only university of applied sciences in Bavaria which offers mathematics as a major course.

It consists of a process on the backside of the vertebrae, the hyposphene, that fits in a depression in the front side of the next vertebrae, the hypantrum. Hyposphene-hypantrum articulations occur in the dorsal vertebrae and sometimes also in the posteriormost cervical and anteriormost caudal vertebrae. In most tetrapods including the human, the vertebrae are connected with each other only via the centrum and the zygapophysis joints. Additional joints like the hyposphene-hypantrum articulations, which add rigidity to the vertebral column, are found in several different reptile lineages; a known example are the zygosphene-zygantrum articulations found in snakes. Hyposphene-hypantrum articulations are found in several unrelated groups within the Archosauromorpha. They occur especially in large forms, for example in rauisuchids and in silesaurids and – within the Dinosauria – in saurischians. They evolved to make the vertebral column more rigid and stable and probably had supported the gigantism in sauropod dinosaurs. Early Dinosauromorphs (early ancestors of dinosaurs) like Marasuchus, Lagosuchus and Euparkeria as well as ornithischian dinosaurs lack hyposphene-hypantrum articulations. Because these articulations are absent in both saurischian ancestors and all non-saurischian dinosaurs, they are considered a synapomorphy (a distinctive feature) of the Saurischia, as proposed by Gauthier (1986). Hyposphene- hypantrum articulations are found in all the basal members of the Saurischia. However, they became lost in several saurischian lineages. They were present in the derived and birdlike dromaeosaurid Rahonavis, but are lost in modern day's birds, probably due to their highly modified vertebrae. Within the Sauropodomorpha, they were present in prosauropods and most sauropods, but became independently lost in two cretaceous sauropod lineages, the Titanosauria and the Rebbachisauridae. The hyposphene usually consists of a vertical ridge and is situated below the postzygapophysis, whereas the hypantrum is situated between the prezygapophysis. In sauropods, this joint is extremely variable.

It had both secular and religious implications, Constantine having unified the Roman Empire of his time, and made Christianity a state religion. Constantine was associated also, through the work Oratio ad sanctorum coetum (\\"Oration of Constantine\\" or \\"sermon of Constantine\\"), with the Christian reading of the fourth Eclogue of Virgil. Here a Sybilline oracle is invoked as a supposed source of Virgil. The Christian interpretation is Messianic, an idea grafted onto Virgil's original praise of a coming Golden Age of empire.Virgil's Messianic eclogue, its meaning, occasion & sources; three studies by Joseph B. Mayor, W. Warde Fowler [and] R.S. Conway. With the text of the Eclogue, and a verse translation by R.S. Conway (1907), p. 23; archive.org. Background Constantine III of Britain (6th century) was one of the legendary kings of Britain, having a slender historical basis; Constantine I of Scotland (5th century) was a mythical figure from the king- list of George Buchanan. Constantine I of the Picts (9th century) was a real historical figure. The main historical reference of the \\"British Constantine\\", however, from the 12th century to the 18th century, was the Roman Emperor Constantine I. This was the period in which the legend that Constantine was a British native was taken seriously, and had significance for politics. It was bound up with completely unattested stories about the British origin of his mother, Helena of Constantinople, important in Christian tradition. While Constantine was at York in 306 with his father Constantius Chlorus, and was declared Augustus on his father's death in that year, there is no historical evidence to connect Helena with Britain.Mulligan, pp. 260–1. Traditions The chroniclers William of Malmesbury and Henry of Huntingdon mention the \\"British Constantine\\" myth as factual, the former being presumed to have priority by a few years (by 1125), the latter making King Coel of Colchester Constantine's maternal grandfather in his Historia Anglorum.Mulligan, p. 261. A few years later Geoffrey of Monmouth embroidered the tale, making Coel father of Helena rebel against King Asclepiodotus in his Historia regum Britanniae, and Constantine an ancestor of King Arthur. In this form Constantine was a supporting figure in the \\"British myth\\" (see list of legendary kings of Britain). Ralph de Diceto adhered to the classical history of Constantine's origins, to be found in Eutropius, but otherwise English historians accepted Geoffrey's account; and Helena's British origins were alluded to in the Golden Legend.Mulligan, p. 262–4. Ralph Higden in his Polychronicon emphasized the Christian role of Constantine.Mulligan, p. 264. The 15th-century chronicle of Adam Usk asserted that the Greeks of his time considered that they descended from a \\"British Constantine\\". John Capgrave and John Lydgate lauded Constantine.Mulligan, p. 265. In international relations, the British Constantine was deployed at the Council of Constance to argue assertively for separate English representation, as distinct from the \\"German nation\\" in which it had been traditionally included.Mulligan, p. 266–7. Henry VIII, Arthur and Constantine The early Tudor concern with traditional history was Arthurian, as evidenced by the name chosen for Arthur, Prince of Wales. Henry VIII made a conscious political decision of 1533 to identify instead with the Constantine figure. The Constantine connection with the Tudors had been laid out by John Rous, in work taken up by Robert Fabyan and then John Rastell. As a consequence Polydore Vergil was allowed to publish his Historia Anglicana in 1534, a work dismissive of the Arthurian matter, but supporting the British origins of Helena. He also imported a tradition linking Claudius Gothicus with the Constantinian dynasty, significant for Tudor hereditary claims.Mulligan, p. 268 (note 41)–71. Elizabeth compared with Constantine The casting of Elizabeth I as a \\"British Constantine\\" (rather than English) depended on foreign policy towards Scotland, and therefore was problematic. John Foxe in dedicating his Actes and Monuments to Elizabeth compared her to Constantine, and a woodcut from the 1563 edition portrayed her as a \\"second Constantine\\". Elizabeth I as Constantine, from John Foxe's Actes and Monuments James compared with Constantine James I in a medal struck for his 1603 accession to the English throne claimed by means of the Latin inscription to be \\"emperor of the whole island of Britain\\". Because of English parliamentary resistance to such a title, James backed away from further assertions of imperium; but comparisons persisted to Roman emperors, Emperor Augustus as well as Constantine. Ten years later, Joseph Hall preached for the anniversary to the king and elaborated the Constantine parallel. John Gordon preached on Constantine's British birth: it was still widely believed that his mother Helena was a Briton. William Symonds picked up on the legendary descent of the House of Stuart from Constantine. James Maxwell projected a genealogical work that would demonstrate the descent of the heir apparent Prince Charles from 49 emperors, hinting at a role as Last World Emperor. This implication contrasts with Foxe on Elizabeth, who did not imply a role for her as Last Emperor. Maxwell and Sir William Alexander promoted ideas of a British restoration of Constantine's eastern empire. Constantine was associated with the holding of the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Since James was following a conciliarist strategy to reunite Christendom, the comparison was flattering to him. It also, however, could attract criticism from the Puritan flank. Richard Stock, for example, contrasted Biblical inerrancy with the possibility of doubting the outcomes of councils. Later developments Religious critique Some Protestants took a less favourable view of Constantine, as the 17th century proceeded. By the time of John Milton's first publication Of Reformation of 1641, the orthodox Church of England attitude to Constantine, of John Jewell and Foxe, had parted company with radical Protestants, who took his reign to be the beginning of the \\"apostasy\\" of the Christian church. In parallel, Thomas Brightman began a process of decoupling \\"imperial\\" and \\"apocalyptic\\" themes of the end times. Patrick Forbes considered that Constantine bore responsibility for bishops becoming ambitious. In fact there was ambivalence about the historical figure of Constantine, because his appeal in religious terms was to Erastianism (for example to John Foxe); while Puritans preferred to keep the state out of the church, and also might distance themselves from Rome in any form. Later usage Inigo Jones planned at Temple Bar a structure based on the Arch of Constantine, with an equestrian statue of Charles I on top. It was, however, never built. Henry Stubbe as a courtier used the comparison of Charles II of England with Constantine. Pierre Jurieu invoked the title for William III of England. John Whittel in 1693 used the title Constantinus redivivus for his book on William's military successes.

Tyler and Huo (2002) is based on surveys of people in different ethnic groups to understand their concepts of justice. They found that minority African-Americans and Hispanics have essentially the same concept of justice as majority whites but different experiences. They describe two alternative strategies for effective law enforcement: * Deterrence: effective but inefficient * Process-based: efficient and effective The difference in efficiency follows, because people who perceive that they may be victimized unfairly by law enforcement are less likely to cooperate. Tyler and Huo's analyses suggests that biased, unprofessional behavior of police, prosecutors and judges not only produces concerns of injustice, it cripples law enforcement efforts by making it more difficult for police and prosecutors to obtain the evidence needed to convict guilty parties.

He is notable for being second in command of the deception organisation 'A' Force and well as head of Ops. B (the department responsible for part of the Operation Bodyguard planning). He was educated at Eton College.Daily Telegraph obituary as above Wild joined the Territorial Army in 1924 and obtained a transfer, via the influence of his uncle at the War Office, to the 11th Hussars the following year. He served with the 11th in England and Egypt (from 1933) before being posted home - first for training and then to teach at Bovington camp. Wild spent some time trying to return to his regiment, but was unsuccessful. Upon his eventual return to Egypt (where the 11th Hussars were still based) he was posted as a staff officer at GHQ Middle East Command. Whilst in Cairo, disheartened by his situation, Wild ran into Dudley Clarke, an old friend. Clarke was head of 'A' Force, the department in charge of deception for the entire region. After renewing their acquaintance Clarke, in April 1942, asked Wild to join him at 'A' Force as his deputy and head of the \\"Operations\\" section. Wild spent around eighteen months at 'A' Force, and was appointed an OBE for his work, before Clarke volunteered him to head a similar department in England. Ops (B) was a section of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force charged with deception along the Western Front. Wild accepted the position in December 1943 and was briefed on Operation Bodyguard, the cover plan for the impending Allied invasion of Europe. Theoretically Wild held a lot of power in this new role, but a combination of his own limitations and clashes with David Strangeways (head of 'R' Force and also widely influential) made his contribution smaller than it could have been. Following the end of the Second World War, deception was scaled back. However, Wild remained involved in secret work until the 1970s (he retired from the Army in 1950). In 1971 he became embroiled in a plagiarism dispute between Roger Fleetwood- Hesketh and Sefton Delmer, Wild appears to have provided the former's report on Operation Bodyguard to Delmer whilst the latter was writing a book about deception during the war. Wild died in 1995. Early career Wild joined the army in 1924. His uncle, Herbert Uniacke, helped him avoid the usual entrance exam. Wild joined the Territorial Army Royal East Kent Regiment as a second lieutenant, before being transferred to the 11th Hussars (via the influence of his uncle at the War Office). In 1933 the 11th was posted to Egypt, where Wild was appointed Technical Adjutant. After a tour of duty across Western Africa and Palestine he was sent back to England for a course at the Royal Military Academy. Before he could return to his unit, Wild was sent posted to Bovington Camp as one of the first instructors on a new cavalry wing. Wild was disappointed by this turn of events, wishing to serve active duty with the 11th Hussars. He spent some time trying to return to his regiment, taking courses and eventually transferring to the Staff College at Camberley. All this was to no avail; upon finally arriving in Egypt in August 1941 the Hussars had a new commanding officer who was not interested in Wild's return. Instead he was posted to GHQ Middle East Command as a staff officer to Major General Richard McCreery. This was a huge disappointment to Wild: writing in 1980, David Mure notes that Wild considered all of his later Army career \\"a poor second to service with the 11th Hussars\\". 'A' Force Despite his disappointment in his new role, Wild was pleased to find Dudley Clarke was in Cairo. The pair had become acquainted in Morocco and Palestine during the 1930s. They shared a love of the cinema, and would meet for dinner before going on to see a film or two. Wild was unsure of Clarke's secretive role at Middle East Command, but in April Clarke offered Wild a promotion and the chance to work for him. Despite being told nothing of the role Wild accepted and in May joined 'A' Force, the department charged with planning military deception in the region, as head of the Operations section and Clarke's deputy. In late 1942, Clarke departed for England to discuss cover plans for Operation Torch. Wild was left in charge of 'A' Force in his stead and oversaw Operation Treatment, part of the cover for the Second Battle of El Alamein. Treatment's \\"story\\" was that a planned assault by Allied forces would be on 6 November, two weeks later than the real date, and complimented various physical deceptions (used to mask troop movements). On 14 October 1943 Wild was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The citation, written by Clarke, made reference the Wild's work at 'A' Force - in particular during late 1942 and his work in south and east Africa in 1942–43. Ops (B) and Plan Bodyguard Ops (B) was a special department of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) dedicated to deception planning (the \\"normal\\" operation planning department was called Ops (A)). It was set up in early 1943 to help organise Operation Bodyguard, the deception plan intended to cover the Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944. By November it was realised that an experienced leader was required to head the section, and Clarke secretly volunteered Wild. Wild thought he had been given some leave when, on 17 December, he was sent home to England. However, it was merely an opportunity to be assessed by senior members of SHAEF. Shortly after Christmas, Wild was appointed the new head of Ops (B) and promoted to full colonel. John Bevan, head of the London Controlling Section, briefed Wild on the Bodyguard deception and introduced him to the Twenty Committee. Bodyguard was a broad strategic deception intended to lead the Germans into thinking that the Allied invasion target was Calais. One of the plan's main avenues of disinformation were double agents, controlled by the Twenty Committee. Wild joined the committee and was tasked with coordinating all of the information disseminated by the agents. Wild organised Ops (B) along the lines of 'A' Force (two sections, covering intelligence and operations) and began planning Operation Fortitude, the key segment of the Bodyguard Plan. By January a formal structure for deception planning had been established; Ops (B) would be responsible for planning within the SHAEF umbrella and direct the information to be sent by double agent channels while the London Controlling Section would have overall strategic control of deception. In practice, Wild, Bevan and the other planners communicated informally - a situation that worked well but left very little written record. Although the position had a lot of authority, Wild struggled to make an impact, partly due to being \\"useless\\" (as a colleague put it) but also because of clashes with Colonel David Strangeways. Strangeways was another 'A' Force graduate, and former commander of the 21st Army Group. For Bodyguard he was commanding R Force, and did not approve of the plan or of Wild and took every opportunity to criticize both. In the end he succeeded in removing a lot of the operational control from Ops (B). Wild was left in charge of the \\"special means\\"; double agents and propaganda. However, in the aftermath of D-Day, Wild regained control of deception planning, particularly the use of double agents, for the campaign in France. He responded by dispatching a contingent of his staff across the Channel. During this time Wild's relationship with the armed forces was tense. He refused to use any agent captured on the continent for deception, and often failed to communicate the content of deceptive messages to the affected units. Wild also took steps to limit Strangeways (and other deceptive units), often refusing the use of fictional units. Postwar Following the end of the Second World War, deception planning was scaled back. The London Controlling Section became a three-man committee with little of its wartime power. By 1947 Wild was one of the remaining members, representing the security services and the army. Wild retired from the army on 12 June 1950, although he continued to be involved in deception work into the next decade. In 1971, Wild became involved in a plagiarism dispute centred on Sefton Delmer's book The Counterfeit Spy, an account of Operation Fortitude. Much of the material was taken from a government report by Roger Fleetwood-Hesketh; it appeared that Wild had passed Hesketh's work on to Delmer. After a threat to sue (in which the government intervened to point out Hesketh's work was under Crown Copyright), Delmer published a second edition which credited Hesketh. In 1980, Wild wrote an introduction to David Mure's Master of Deception. He died in 1995. According to his obituary, Wild was \\"a useful cricketer, golfer and horseman ... patriotic and devoted to reforming what he described as the malaise affecting British society in the 1970s. He held that this stemmed from a lack of leadership in the Church and an anarchist attitude in the media. He was particularly concerned about the slanted versions of the news he thought that the BBC broadcast.\\" Personality Wild was not well liked by many within the services. He was considered \\"humourless and arrogant\\". He appears to have been anti-American. Jack Corbett, who met him in 1947 during a trip to London to examine British deception in the postwar era, found Wild to be a reluctant collaborator. Although Corbett opined that Wild was \\"cordial and socially friendly\\", he described him as \\"a slippery customer\\". Wild's decree that no agents captured in Europe could be used for deception caused considerable resentment amongst the Allied establishment. The Americans, in particular, perceived it as a slight and indication that Wild did not trust men on the ground. This, and other restrictions on agent use, caused friction between Wild and the armed forces.

This barge is designed to function as a \\"novel engineering solution\\" which they refer to as an Arctic Containment System to respond should a blowout event occur at drilling sites in the Beaufort or Chukchi Seas. According to testimony provided to Senator Mark Begich on 11 October 2012, Coast Guard Rear Admiral Thomas Ostebo said the certification for the Shell spill barge Arctic Challenger to operate in Alaska was given on the 10th of October at the Bellingham, Washington shipyard where it was constructed. Ostebo is commander of the Coast Guard’s 17th district, which covers Alaska. The US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) reported that the vessel was able to meet their requirement for processing 2000 gallons of seawater per minute during testing in March, 2013. Greenberry Industrial has been contracted to provide fabrication and construction services at the Port of Bellingham in Washington state. Shell Oil Company intends Arctic Challenger and it's onboard systems to serve as their \\"fourth line of defense\\" against a blow out in their drilling operations in the Arctic that could result in a seafloor oil gusher. The major component of the project is the containment dome which is designed to be lowered over the blowout to vacuum up the spewing crude oil and natural gas and to deliver those products to the equipment on the ship for separation and processing to ameliorate the damage otherwise expected from a submarine blowout resulting from a drilling catastrophe such as occurred with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and other offshore blowouts. The first line of defense is pouring drilling mud down the well. The second line is activating a blowout preventer, which for Shell Oil in the Arctic involves a double shear ram for redundancy. The third line defense is a capping stack such as was used to try to contain the Macondo Well blowout from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010. The fourth line is the containment dome. There is experience with such technology on the BP Macondo Well in 2010. That attempt failed ultimately because \\"methane gas escaping from the well would come into contact with cold sea water and form slushy hydrates, essentially clogging the cofferdam with hydrocarbon ice.\\" Shell Oil Company has stated via their spokesperson Kelly op de Weegh “We are committed to having the Arctic containment system in place before drilling through liquid hydrocarbon zones, and that commitment will not change. We are nearing completion of this first- of-its-kind Arctic containment system, which houses response, containment and separation processes in one vessel. While it’s a fourth line of defense in the unlikely event of a loss of well control, it will not be deployed until it meets our high standards.” From the report on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling: > Industry’s responsibilities do not end with efforts to prevent blowouts like > that at the Macondo well. They extend to efforts to contain any such > incidents as quickly as possible and to mitigate the harm caused by spills > through effective response efforts. The oil and gas industry needs to > develop large-scale rescue, response, and containment capabilities. To be > successful—and to gain the trust of the industry, government, insurers and > the public—these new efforts by industry must include extensive planning and > preparations; developing scenarios of new types of potential accidents; and > conducting full-scale drills and training exercises that involve both people > and equipment, and industry must do all of these things continually.

Little is known about it and it no longer exists. The castle was built by the Clan Murray in the late 13th to early 14th century, after it had extended its holdings south from its heartland in Morayshire. The castle predates the nearby chapel, which is dated to 1446. The castle was dismantled in 1747, following the Jacobite rebellion, and was completely demolished in 1833.Tullibardine Castle at stravalging.com; retrieved 10 May 2017 Tullibardine Chapel Tullibardine Chapel () was built in the 1446 by David Murray of Tullibardine as a family chapel and burial site, and members of the Murray family were buried there until 1900.

The station, which opened in 1856 was closed in 1964. The name is now used by the Tullibardine distillery in nearby Blackford, which opened in 1949, and to several of their brands of whisky.

Background German invasion Punch in 1914 depicting \\"little\\" Belgium barring \\"big\\" Germany's path When World War I began, Germany invaded neutral Belgium and Luxembourg as part of the Schlieffen Plan, in an attempt to capture Paris quickly by catching the French off guard by invading through neutral countries. It was this action that technically caused the British to enter the war, as they were still bound by the 1839 agreement to protect Belgium in the event of war. On 2 August 1914, the German government demanded that German armies be given free passage through Belgian territory, although this was refused by the Belgian government on 3 August. The King Albert I addressed his Parliament on 4 August, saying \\"Never since 1830 has a graver hour sounded for Belgium. The strength of our right and the need of Europe for our autonomous existence make us still hope that the dreaded events will not occur.\\" The same day German troops invaded Belgium crossing the frontier at dawn. Liège was attacked on 4 August and fell on 7 August. It is widely claimed that the Belgian Army’s resistance during the early days of the war, with the army – around a tenth the size of the German Army – holding up the German offensive for nearly a month, gave the French and British forces time to prepare for the Marne counteroffensive later in the year.Barbara W. Tuchman, The Guns of August (1962) pp 191–214 In fact, the German advance on Paris was almost exactly on schedule.Donnell, C. (2013). Breaking the Fortress Line 1914. Pen and Sword, pp196-200. The German invaders treated any resistance—such as demolition of bridges and rail lines—as illegal and subversive, shooting the offenders and burning buildings in retaliation.Spencer Tucker, ed., The European Powers in the First World War (1999) pp 114–20 Flanders was the main base of the British Army and it saw some of the greatest loss of life on both sides of the Western Front. German occupation 1914–18 German stamp, overprinted with Belgien (Belgium) for use in the occupied country The Germans governed the occupied areas of Belgium (over 95% of the country) while a small area around Ypres remained under Belgian control. An occupation authority, known as the General Government, was given control over the majority of the territory although the two provinces of East and West Flanders were given separate status as a war zone under the direct control of the German army. Elsewhere martial law prevailed. For the majority of the occupation, the German military governor was Moritz von Bissing (1914–17). Beneath the governor was a network of regional and local German kommandanturen and each locality was under the ultimate control of a German officer.Léon van der Essen, A short history of Belgium (1920) pp 174–5 Many civilians fled the war zones to safer parts of Belgium. Many refugees from all over the country went to the Netherlands (which was neutral) and about 300,000 to France. Over 200,000 went to Britain, where they resettled in London and found war jobs. The British and French governments set up the War Refugees Committee (WRC) and the Secours National, to provide relief and support; there were an additional 1,500 local WRC committees in Britain. The high visibility of the refugees underscored the role of Belgium in the minds of the French and British.Pierre Purseigle, \\"'A Wave on to Our Shores': The Exile and Resettlement of Refugees from the Western Front, 1914–1918,\\" Contemporary European History (2007): 16#4 pp 427–444, [online at Proquest]Peter Cahalan, Belgian Refugee Relief in England during the Great War (New York: Garland, 1982); In the spring of 1915, German authorities started construction on the Wire of Death, a lethal electric fence along the Belgian- Dutch border which would claim the lives of between 2,000 and 3,000 Belgian refugees trying to escape the occupied country. On the advice of the Belgian government in exile, civil servants remained in their posts for the duration of the conflict, carrying out the day-to-day functions of government. All political activity was suspended and Parliament shut down. While farmers and coal miners kept up their routines, many larger businesses largely shut down, as did the universities. The Germans helped set up the first solely Dutch- speaking university in Ghent. The Germans sent in managers to operate factories that were underperforming. Lack of effort was a form of passive resistance; Kossmann says that for many Belgians the war years were \\"a long and extremely dull vacation.\\"E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries: 1780–1940(1978) p 525, 528–9 Belgian workers were conscripted into forced labour projects; by 1918, the Germans had deported 120,000 Belgian workers to Germany.Bernard A. Cook, Belgium: a history (2002) pp. 102–7 The Rape of Belgium The Germans Arrive by the American artist George Bellows depicting the 1914 German atrocities in Belgium. The German Army was outraged at how Belgium had frustrated the Schlieffen Plan to capture Paris. From top to bottom there was a firm belief that the Belgians had unleashed illegal saboteurs (called \\"francs-tireurs\\") and that civilians had tortured and maltreated German soldiers. The response was a series of multiple large-scale attacks on civilians and the destruction of historic buildings and cultural centers. The German army executed between 5,500 and 6,500John Horne and Alan Kramer, German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial (Yale U.P. 2001) French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. Individuals suspected of partisan activities were summarily shot. Historians researching German Army records have discovered 101 \\"major\\" incidents—where ten or more civilians were killed—with a total of 4,421 executed. Historians have also discovered 383 \\"minor\\" incidents that led to the deaths of another 1,100 Belgians. Almost all were claimed by Germany to be responses to guerrilla attacks. In addition some high-profile Belgian figures, including politician Adolphe Max and historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The German position was that widespread sabotage and guerrilla activities by Belgian civilians were wholly illegal and deserved immediate harsh collective punishment. Recent research that systematically studied German Army sources has demonstrated that they in fact encountered no irregular forces in Belgium during the first two and a half months of the invasion. The Germans were responding instead to a phantom fear they had unconsciously created themselves. =Bryce Report and international response= The British were quick to tell the world about German atrocities. Britain sponsored the \\"Committee on Alleged German Outrages\\" known as the Bryce Report. Published in May 1915, the Report provided elaborate details and first-hand accounts, including excerpts from diaries and letters found on captured German soldiers. The Report was a major factor in changing public opinion in neutral countries, especially the United States. After Britain shipped 41,000 copies to the US, the Germans responded with their own report on atrocities against German soldiers by Belgian civilians. The Bryce Report was ridiculed in the 1920s and 1930s and afterwards as highly exaggerated wartime propaganda. It relied too heavily on unproven allegations of refugees and distorted interpretations of diaries of German soldiers.Trevor Wilson, \\"Lord Bryce's Investigation into Alleged German Atrocities in Belgium, 1914–1915,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1979) 14#3 pp 369–383. Recent scholarship has not tried to validate the statements in the Bryce Report. Instead research has gone into the official German records and have confirmed that the Germans committed large-scale deliberate atrocities in Belgium.John Horne and Alan Kramer, German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial (Yale University Press, 2002); Larry Zuckerman, The Rape of Belgium: The Untold Story of World War I (NYU Press, 2004); Jeff Lipkes, Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914 (Leuven University Press, 2007) International relief Cardinal Mercier became a hero; his visits to the US inspired American Catholics and strengthened Belgian pride Belgium faced a food crisis and an international response was organized by an American engineer based in London, Herbert Hoover, on the request of Émile Francqui, whose Comité National de Secours et d'Alimentation (CNSA) realized that the only way to avoid a famine in Belgium was through imports from overseas.George H. Nash, The Life of Herbert Hoover: The Humanitarian, 1914–1917 (1988) Hoover's Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB) received the permission of both Germany and the Allies for their activities.David Burner, Herbert Hoover: A Public Life (1996) p. 74. As chairman of the CRB, Hoover worked with Francqui to raise money and support overseas, transporting food and aid to Belgium which was then distributed by the CNSA. The CRB purchased and imported millions of tons of foodstuffs for the CN to distribute, and watched over the CN to make sure the Germans did not appropriate the food. The CRB became a veritable independent republic of relief, with its own flag, navy, factories, mills, and railroads. Private donations and government grants (78%) supplied an $11-million-a-month budget.Burner, Herbert Hoover p. 79. At its peak, the American arm, the American Relief Administration (ARA) fed 10.5 million people daily. Great Britain became reluctant to support the CRB, preferring instead to emphasize Germany's obligation to supply the relief; Winston Churchill led a military faction that considered the Belgian relief effort \\"a positive military disaster.\\"Burner, p. 82. Internal politics The prewar Catholic ministry remained in office as a government in exile with Charles de Broqueville continuing as prime minister and also taking on the war portfolio. Viscount Julien Davignon continued as foreign minister until 1917, when de Broqueville gave up the war ministry and took over foreign affairs. The government was broadened to include all parties, as politics were suspended for the duration; of course, no elections were possible. The two main opposition leaders, Paul Hymans of the Liberals and Emile Vandervelde of the Labour party, became ministers without portfolio in 1914. In a cabinet shakeup in May 1918, de Broqueville was excluded altogether. The government was based in the French city of Le Havre, but communications with the people behind German lines were difficult and roundabout. The government in exile did not govern Belgium, and so its politicians instead squabbled endlessly, and plotted unrealistic foreign policy moves, such as the annexation of Luxembourg or a slice of the Netherlands after the war.Sally Marks, Innocent Abroad p 21-35 Belgium was not officially one of the Allies. In turn they did not consult with Belgium, but Britain, France and Russia formally pledged in 1916 that \\"when the moment comes, the Belgian government will be called to participate in the peace negotiations and that they will not put an end to the hostilities unless Belgium is re-established in its political and economic independence and largely indemnified for the damage which she has undergone. They will lend their aid to Belgium to assure her commercial and financial rehabilitation.\\"Sally Marks, Innocent Abroad p 24 =Flemish identity= Flemish consciousness of their national identity grew through the events and experiences of war. The German occupying authorities, under Von Bissing and influenced by pre-war Pan-Germanism, viewed the Flemish as an oppressed people and launched a policy to appeal to the demands of the Flemish Movement which had emerged in the late 19th century. These measures were collectively known as the Flamenpolitik (\\"Flemish Policy\\"). From 1916, the Germans sponsored the creation of \\"Von Bissing University\\" which was the first university that taught in the Dutch language. Dutch was also introduced as the language of instruction in all state-supported schools in Flanders in 1918. The German measures split the Movement between the \\"activists\\" or \\"maximalists\\", who believed that using German support was their only chance to realize their objectives, and the \\"passivists\\" who opposed German involvement. In 1917, the Germans created the Raad van Vlaanderen (\\"Council of Flanders\\") as a quasi- autonomous government in Flanders composed of \\"activists\\". In December 1917, the council attempted to achieve Flemish independence from Belgium but the defeat of Germany in the war meant that they never achieved success. After the war, many \\"activists\\" were arrested for collaboration. Independently, among the Belgian soldiers on the Yser Front, the Flemish Frontbeweging (\\"Front Movement\\") was formed from Flemish soldiers in the Belgian Army to campaign for greater use of the Dutch language in education and government, although it was not separatist.Cook, Belgium: a history pp. 104–5 Several soldiers that were involved with the Flemish movement were send to a penal military unit in Orne, Normandy called woodchoppers of the Orne.Dr. J. Goossenaertskring reikt voor het eerst Alfons De Schepperprijs uit Geert Herman, Nieuwsblad, 7 juli 2014, article in DutchPeter Verplancke, VRT, 15 juli 2018, article in Dutch Tom Simoens, CHTP-BEG - n° 23 / 2011, article in Dutch Van arrangeren tot renseigneren. Smaad en geweld Van militairen Tegen hun oversten tijdens de eerste wereldoorlog Kossmann concludes that the German policy of fostering separatism in Flanders was a failure because it did not win popular support.Kossmann, The Low Countries: 1780–1940 (1978) p 528 Belgian military operations Belgian soldier at the front line, 1918 Belgium was poorly prepared for war. Strict neutrality meant there was no coordination of any kind with anyone. It had a new, inexperienced general staff. It started compulsory service in 1909; the plan was to have an army of 340,000 men by 1926. In 1914 the old system had been abandoned and the new one was unready, lacking trained officers and sergeants, as well as modern equipment. The army had 102 machine guns and no heavy artillery. The strategy was to concentrate near Brussels and delay a German invasion as long as possible—a strategy that in the event proved highly effective as it disrupted the German timetable. For example, the German timetable required the capture of the railway center of Liège in two days; it took 11.Hew Strachen, The First World War: Volume I: To Arms (2001) 1:208-12, 216Emile Joseph Galet and Ernest Swinton, Albert King of the Belgians in the Great War (1931), pp 73–106 Much of the small army was captured early on as the frontier forts surrendered. In late 1914 the King had only 60,000 soldiers left.Kossmann, Low Countries(1978) pp 523–4 During the war a few young men volunteered to serve, so by 1918 the total force had returned to 170,000. That was far too few to launch a major offensive. The Germans had nothing to gain from an attack, so the short Belgian front was an island of relative calm as gigantic battles raged elsewhere on the Western Front. The total of Belgian soldiers killed came to about 2.0% of its eligible young men (compared to 13.3% in France and 12.5% in Germany).Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War (1999) p 299 Yser Front The ruins of Ypres, after its three battles. King Albert I stayed in the Yser as commander of the military to lead the army while the Belgian government, under Charles de Broqueville withdrew to Le Havre in France. Belgian soldiers fought a number of significant delaying actions in 1914 during the initial invasion. At the Battle of Liège, the town's fortifications held off the invaders for over a week, buying valuable time for Allied troops to arrive in the area. Additionally, the German \\"Race to the Sea\\" was stopped dead by exhausted Belgian forces at the Battle of the Yser. The dual significance of the battle was that the Germans were unable to complete their occupation of the entire country, and the Yser area remained unoccupied. The success was a propaganda coup for Belgium.Spencer Tucker, ed., The European Powers in the First World War (1999) pp 116–8 Belgian troops continued to hold the same sector of frontline, known as the Yser Front and by now a part of the main Western Front, until 1918, a fact that provided a propaganda coup to the Belgian forces on the Western Front for the duration of the war.  Final Offensive (Autumn 1918)  By 28 September 1918, the Belgian Army had been reorganized in 12 infantry divisions. They formed part of the Belgian-French-British Army Group Flanders under command of King Albert I of Belgium and his French Chief of Staff General Jean Degoutte. They played an important part in the Fifth Battle of Ypres, in which they breached the German lines at Houthulst and conquered Passchendaele, Langemark and Zonnebeke. After a pause between 2 and 14 October, the Belgian Army also participated in the Battle of Courtai, in which it liberated Bruges and Ostend. Between 20 October and 11 November, it fought in the Battle of the Lys and the Escaut and reached the outskirts of Ghent by 11 November. The Final Offensive had been very costly for the Belgian Army. It lost one- fifth of its forces in casualties, one-third of all the losses it sustained throughout the whole War.Osprey Publishing, The Belgian Army in World War I (2009) pp 36–37 Belgian Congo and the East Africa Campaign Native soldiers from the Belgian Congo ford a river during the African Campaign, 1916 German presence in Africa posed no direct threat to the Belgian Congo; however, in 1914 a German gunboat sank a number of Belgian vessels on Lake Tanganyika. Congolese forces, under Belgian officers, fought German colonial forces in the Cameroons and seized control of the western third of German East Africa, advancing as far as the town at Tabora. The League of Nations in 1925 made Belgium the trustee of this territory (modern Rwanda and Burundi) as the mandate of Ruanda-Urundi. Eastern Front The Belgian Expeditionary Corps was a small armoured car unit; it was sent to Russia in 1915 and fought on the Eastern Front. The Minerva armoured car was used for reconnaissance, long distance messaging and carrying out raids and small scale engagements. Sixteen Belgians were killed in action in the east. Aftermath Postwar settlements King Albert I went to the Paris Peace Conference in April 1919, where he met with the Big Four and the other leaders of France, Italy, Britain and the United States. He had four strategic goals: 1) to restore and expand the Belgian economy, using cash reparations from Germany; 2) to assure Belgium's security by the creation of a new buffer state on the left bank of the Rhine; 3) to revise the obsolete treaty of 1839; and 4) to promote a 'rapprochement' between Belgium and the Grand duchy of Luxembourg. A typical municipal war memorial in Poperinge, Flanders. The words on it translate to English as \\"To our heroes in 1914–1918 and 1940–1945\\" He strongly advised against a harsh, punitive treaty against Germany that would eventually provoke German revenge.Vincent Dujardin, Mark van den Wijngaert, et al. Léopold III He also considered that the dethronement of the princes of Central Europe and, in particular, the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire would constitute a serious menace to peace and stability on the continent.Charles d'Ydewalle. Albert and the Belgians: Portrait of a King. The Allies considered Belgium to be the chief victim of the war, and it aroused enormous popular sympathy, but the King's advice played a small role in Paris.Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919 (2003) pp 106, 272 Belgium was given much less than it wanted, with a total payment of three billion German gold marks ($500 million in 1919; in ); the money did not stimulate the lethargic Belgian economy of the 1920s. Belgium also received a small slice of territory in the east of the country (known as Eupen-Malmedy) from Germany, which remains part of the country to this day. Its demands for a slice of Zeeland in the Netherlands (which had remained neutral during the conflict), were rejected and led to ill-will. Britain was willing to guarantee Belgian borders only if it committed to neutrality, which Albert rejected. Instead, Belgium became a junior partner with France in an occupation of part of Germany under a 1920 Treaty. As outlined in the Treaty of Versailles, Belgium was also given a League of Nations mandate over the former German colonies in Africa of Rwanda and Burundi.Sally Marks, Innocent Abroad: Belgium at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 (1991) On the whole, Belgian diplomacy was poorly handled and ineffective.Kossmann, The Low Countries pp 575–8, 649 Between 1923 and 1925, Belgian and French soldiers occupied the Ruhr to force the Weimar government to maintain payment of reparations. Commemoration Typical Belgian war graves at Houthulst, near the former Yser Front Due to the hundreds of thousands of British and Canadian casualties, the blood-red red poppies that sprang up in no man's land when fields were torn up by artillery were immortalized in the 1915 poem In Flanders Fields. In the British Empire and America, poppies became a symbol of human life lost in war and were adopted as an emblem of remembrance from 1921. The suffering of Flanders is still remembered by Flemish organizations during the yearly Yser pilgrimage and \\"Wake of the Yser\\" in Diksmuide at the monument of The Yser tower. British veterans and civilians in the 1920s created a shrine of sacrifice in Belgium. The city of Ypres was made the symbol of all Britain was fighting for and was given an almost sacred aura. The Ypres League transformed the horrors of trench warfare into a spiritual quest in which British and Imperial troops were purified by their sacrifice. After the war Ypres became a pilgrimage destination for Britons to imagine and share the sufferings of their men and gain a spiritual benefit.Mark Connelly, \\"The Ypres League and the Commemoration of the Ypres Salient, 1914–1940,\\" War in History (2009) 16#1 pp 51–76, online See also * Dodengang * History of Belgium * Belgium in World War II Notes Further reading * Den Hertog, Johan. \\"The Commission for Relief in Belgium and the Political Diplomatic History of the First World War,\\" Diplomacy and Statecraft (2010) 21#4 pp 593–613. * Fox, Sir Frank.

Robert Fleming Life The son of Rev Robert Fleming, he was born in Cambuslang in Lanarkshire in 1660.https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiaesc00scot/fastiecclesiaesc00scot_djvu.txt His early education was at the school of his uncle Rev John Sinclair, minister of Ormiston, Haddingtonshire. In 1679 his father took him to Holland, where he studied at the universities of Leyden and Utrecht. On 9 February 1688 he was privately ordained by Scottish ministers in Holland, without special charge. Fleming moved to England, and was domestic chaplain in a private family for about four years. In 1692 he accepted a call to the pastorate of the English presbyterian congregation at Leyden. On his father's death he was invited to succeed him in the Scots Church at Rotterdam, to which he was inducted in 1695. In 1698 Fleming received a call to the Scots Church, Founders' Hall, Lothbury, supported by William Carstares and William III, who had known him in Holland. Fleming began his ministry there on 19 June 1698. The meeting-house was rebuilt for him about 1700. His position was influential: William III consulted him on the ecclesiastical affairs of Scotland, and he had good relations with Archbishop Thomas Tenison. Through the influence of a kinsman, John, Lord Carmichael, secretary of state for Scotland, he had the offer of the principalship of Glasgow University, but he declined. On 15 May 1701 Fleming succeeded Vincent Alsop as one of the Tuesday lecturers at Salters' Hall, a lectureship which represented the liberal side in the Calvinistic controversy. On 7 May 1707 he was the spokesman of the London ministers of the \\"three denominations\\" in presenting an address of congratulation to Queen Anne on the union with Scotland. A serious illness laid Fleming aside for a time. On his recovery he paid a visit to Holland, where he took part in political negotiations in the Protestant interest. He returned, shortly before the accession of George I of England. He died on 21 May 1716. Joshua Oldfield preached his funeral sermon. He left a widow and several children. Works His Christology (1705–8) shows that while Fleming himself orthodox on the person of Christ, he was opposed to any form of subscription. He held the tenet of the pre-existence of Christ's human soul. To the speculations in his Apocalyptical Key (1701) Fleming chiefly owes his posthumous fame. In 1793, and again in 1848, attention was directed to the apparent historical verification of some of his conjectures. He predicted the fall of the French monarchy by 1794 at latest, and fixed on a period around 1848 as the date at which the papacy would receive an ultimately fatal blow. Fleming follows Joseph Mede, but set the beginning of Antichrist at 768 AD. Fleming published: * The Mirror of Divine Love … a poetical Paraphrase on the .., Song of Solomon … other Poems, &c.;, 1691.

The platforms of Interlaken West station are at a higher level to the right. Canal connecting lake Thun with the Interlaken quay / railway station. BLS passenger ship Stadt Thun alongside the quay. The Interlaken ship canal () is a long canal in the Swiss canton of Bern. It connects Lake Thun with a quay in the town of Interlaken adjacent to Interlaken West railway station, thus allowing shipping services on the lake to serve the town and connect with railway services. It is still in regular use by the Lake Thun passenger ships of the BLS AG. The canal parallels the Aar river throughout its length. It has no locks and maintains the same water level as Lake Thun throughout. As a consequence, the water level of the canal at Interlaken West is significantly lower than that of the adjacent river and surrounding land. At the other side of Interlaken, the uppermost reach of the Interlaken section of the Aar river is used by the Lake Brienz passenger ships of the BLS AG to reach Interlaken Ost railway station. However there is no navigable connection between the two lakes, and in the between them the Aar river drops some , passing over several weirs.  History  Shipping services on Lake Thun date back to at least 1834, when the first steamship was introduced to connect the towns of Thun and Interlaken, at each end of the lake. Interlaken is actually situated on an unnavigable section of the Aar river between Lake Brienz and Lake Thun, and initially services docked at Neuhaus, some away. In 1872, the Bödelibahn railway was constructed from Därligen, on Lake Thun, to Interlaken, and the Interlaken terminus of the Lake Brienz shipping services was moved to Därligen. However by the 1890s the railway was being extended to connect with Thun and the rest of the Swiss railway network, threatening the shipping services, and the United Steam Navigation Company for Lakes Thun and Brienz (VDG) who operated those services responded by constructing the Interlaken ship canal to allow their vessels to reach the centre of Interlaken. The canal was built between 1890 and 1892. The VDG merged with the Thunersee railway in 1912. In turn, this new company was taken over by the Bern-Lötschberg-Simplon railway, which eventually became part of BLS AG, the current operators of the lake shipping.

He started his career in the reserve team but soon impressed new manager Jimmy McIntyre who selected him for the third match of the 1912–13 season on 12 September 1912. Blackmore replaced Sid Kimpton at outside-right, while Kimpton moved to centre-forward to replace the amateur player, Leonard Dawe. The match at Northampton Town was won 2–1 and Blackmore retained his place for the next match before Joe Blake replaced him. Blackmore returned to the side on Christmas Day and played seven further matches (including two in the First Round of the FA Cup against Bury). Of Blackmore's nine first-team appearances in a side that struggled to produce any consistency, five matches ended in defeats, including his final match, against local rivals Portsmouth on 25 January 1913. In September 1913, Blackmore left the club and reverted to local football with Woolston but returned following the start of World War I. He remained with the \\"Saints\\" throughout the war, making 44 appearances in the wartime competitions, scoring seven goals, and spent the 1919–20 season assisting the reserve team, before retiring in the 1920 close season, after which he found employment with the Harland & Wolff shipyard, turning out for the works team.

Bernstein in 2012, in response to a spate of \\"hash flooding\\" denial-of-service attacks in late 2011. Although designed for use as a hash function in the computer science sense, SipHash is fundamentally different from cryptographic hash functions like SHA in that it is only suitable as a message authentication code: a keyed hash function like HMAC. That is, SHA is designed so that it is difficult for an attacker to find two messages X and Y such that SHA(X) = SHA(Y), even though anyone may compute SHA(X). SipHash instead guarantees that, having seen Xi and SipHash(Xi, k), an attacker who does not know the key k cannot find (any information about) k or SipHash(Y, k) for any message Y ∉ {Xi} which they have not seen before. Overview SipHash computes 64-bit message authentication code from a variable-length message and 128-bit secret key. It was designed to be efficient even for short inputs, with performance comparable to non- cryptographic hash functions, such as CityHash, thus can be used to prevent denial-of-service attacks against hash tables (\\"hash flooding\\"), or to authenticate network packets. A variant was later added which produces a 128-bit result. An unkeyed hash function such as SHA is only collision- resistant if the entire output is used. If used to generate a small output, such as an index into a hash table of practical size, then no algorithm can prevent collisions; an attacker need only make as many attempts as there are possible outputs. For example, suppose a network server is designed to be able to handle up to a million requests at once. It keeps track of incoming requests in a hash table with two million entries, using a hash function to map identifying information from each request to one of the two million possible table entries. An attacker who knows the hash function need only feed it arbitrary inputs; one out of two million will have a specific hash value. If the attacker now sends a few hundred requests all chosen to have the same hash value to the server, that will produce a large number of hash collisions, slowing (or possibly stopping) the server with an effect similar to a packet flood of many million requests. By using a key unknown to the attacker, a keyed hash function like SipHash prevents this sort of attack. While it is possible to add a key to an unkeyed hash function (HMAC is a popular technique), SipHash is much more efficient. Functions in SipHash family are specified as SipHash-c-d, where c is the number of rounds per message block and d is the number of finalization rounds. The recommended parameters are SipHash-2-4 for best performance, and SipHash-4-8 for conservative security. The reference implementation was released as public domain software under the CC0. Usage SipHash is used in hash table implementations of various software: * Perl 5 (available as compile-time option) * Python (starting in version 3.4) * Raku * Ruby * Rust * systemd * OpenDNS * Haskell * OpenBSD * Swift * Bitcoin for short transaction IDs * Bloomberg BDE as a C++ object hasherbslh_siphashalgorithm.h Implementations * C (Public domain reference implementation) * Rust * Crypto++ * C# * Haskell * JavaScript * VHDL * Verilog * Go * Swift * PicoLisp See also * Bloom filter (application for fast hashes) * Cryptographic hash function * Hash function * Message authentication code * List of hash functions References External links  Category:Hash functions Category:Public-domain software with source code Category:Creative Commons-licensed works ","title":"SipHash"},{"id":"37927152","text":"Lucie Ignace is a French karateka born December 16, 1992 in Saint-Denis, Réunion.

It is classified as an ataxite. Mineralogy The Dronino meteorite is a classified as an ataxite (iron meteorite). Most of the meteoric iron is kamacite with minor amounts of taenite. The kamacite chemistry contains 7.0% Ni and 0.75% Co, whereas the taenite has 26.5% Ni and 0.35% Co (% of total mass). About 10% of the volume of the meteorite are sulfides. Accessory minerals include chromite and an iron-phosphate, which could possibly be graftonite. Impact Because there are no historical descriptions of the impact event of the Meteorite it has been estimated that the fall would have to have occurred before the earliest settlements formed in that region in 1200. From the distribution of the meteorite fragments it has been estimated that the meteorite formed a crater with a diameter of 30 m. Naming and discovery The meteorite is named after the village Dronino where it was found. The meteorite was discovered by Oleg Gus’kov in July 2000 on his way home from mushroom collecting near the village of Dronino (). He noticed a rusty piece of iron protruding from the ground. Suspecting it to be a meteorite but unable to exhume it, he returned the next day with a shovel and wheelbarrow. He brought the meteorite to his house, where it lay in his garden for the next two years. In this time the meteorite broke into three pieces. Gus’kov sawed one of the pieces apart upon which he realized that it was definitely a meteorite. After that he alerted different experts of his discovery. In early 2003, a piece was identified as a meteorite in Vernad (Vernad on Russian wikipedia). Suspecting that Gus’kov had only found a fragment of a larger meteorite different search parties went to Dronino in summer 2003 and discovered more than 600 fragments with a total mass of about , the largest being .

The game was first released for the iPhone iOS platform on January 11, 2012, with ports later being released for the Microsoft Windows, OS X and Android platforms. In the game, players take turns moving units on a board and attacking enemy units with the objective of being the first to destroy the other player's crystal or eliminate all of the other player's units. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. In his review for Ars Technica, Andrew Webster noted that the gameplay was simple and easy to learn, but that the game also offered a satisfying depth within each turn. The game also features cross platform play across all installed platforms. A sequel to the game was launched in January 2018. On January 9, 2019, Robot Entertainment announced in a blog post that Hero Academy and its sequel would cease operations on April 8, 2019 as one had been long defunct and its sequel had been operating at a financial loss for several months. Gameplay The game is turn-based and focuses on strategy, requiring players to carefully plan out each step of their turn. Each player has one or many crystals and the objective is to be the first player to either eliminate all of the other player's units or destroy the other player's crystal(s). Each turn grants players five moves in the game. Units are played from a hand which is replenished at the end of each round with random new units. In addition to units, a player's hand can also contain spells and healing potions as well as weapons and armor which can be equipped to units. Ars Technica writer Andrew Webster noted that the gameplay was simple for a strategy game, which would \\"make it easy to pick up and play.\\" Factions The game currently contains six factions known as Heroic Teams. * Council is a team made up of human units, and is the default team of the game. * Dark Elves is an expansion team made up of mystical elvish creatures who are known for dark magic. * Dwarves is an expansion team that consists of dwarf characters known for explosive attacks and bonuses to specialty squares. * The Tribe is an expansion team made up of orc-related units, known for aggression. * Team Fortress 2 is a team available exclusively to Steam users, but can be played on all platforms; the team is known for its adaptability and gameplay referencing the Team Fortress 2 title. * Shaolin is an expansion team previously exclusive to the Chinese version of the game; the human team is known for its conversion powers and combination attacks. Development The game was first announced by the developer Robot Entertainment on November 17, 2011, for the iOS platform. The company was founded by Tony Goodman and its first employees were predominantly taken from the recently bankrupt Ensemble Studios, a studio that had previously worked on strategy games including the Age of Empires series and Halo Wars. The new company's first mobile game, Hero Academy was released on January 11, 2012, with an adware version offered for free or an ad-free version available for purchase. At the time of the release, additional downloadable content was made available for purchase including extra avatars, heroic teams, and visual and animation style changes. The purchasable content is primarily visual cosmetic changes and does not offer better units or items which would give a player an advantage. In addition to the cosmetic offerings, the Dark Elves faction includes a new set of skills which Ars Technica writer Andrew Webster called \\"different but not necessarily stronger\\" and likened to purchasing an expansion pack. In a bid to bring western mobile games to China, the Chinese publisher Yodo1 partnered with the developers in June 2012. The untranslated English version of the game was already receiving more downloads from China than any other country except the United States. Beyond translating the game, the Chinese Yodo1 version also has a new race to play in the game, Shaolin monks, as well as other new characters exclusive to the localized version. The company announced in June 2012 that it would port the game to Microsoft Windows with a planned release date set for August 8, 2012, via the Steam digital distribution platform. After missing their target, the company released a statement saying that some players were having issues with the game that needed to be resolved before it could be released, and they planned to make the game available for the platform on August 16 at the latest. The developers beat their deadline, releasing the game onto Steam on August 10. On December 11, 2012, a port of the game to the OS X platform was released via Steam. On October 10, 2013, a port of the game for Android has been released on Google Play. Reception The game received predominantly positive reviews upon release, garnering a 77% rating on the review aggregation website Metacritic. Ars Technica reviewer Andrew Webster wrote that the gameplay was simple compared to other strategy games which made it easy to learn the rules, and he recommended the game stating, \\"there's enough depth to make each quick round surprisingly satisfying.\\" Webster also noted that the game was best played with friends rather than anonymous players since this would ensure turns would finish without delay. Sequel Hero Academy 2 was soft launched in Canada on October 23, 2017. The official launch was January 16, 2018. The sequel was nominated for \\"Best Multiplayer/Competitive Game\\" at the 2018 Webby Awards.

His epithet arabacı means \\"charioteer\\" in Turkish, an allusion to his practice of sending his political enemies to death or exile in a certain tumbrel.  Early years  He was born in Ohrid (; in modern North Macedonia) of Albanian ethnicity. After serving in various government offices, he became a subordinate of Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha, who was appointed as a grand vizier. The empire was engaged in Great Turkish War. Fazıl Mustafa Pasha temporarily halted Austrian advance but was killed in action during the Battle of Slankamen. Five days later, Ahmet II, the sultan appointed Ali Pasha as the new grand vizier.  As grand vizier  Ali Pasha was expected to command the army like his predecessor and mentor Köprülü Fazıl Mustafa Pasha had done. However, Ali Pasha preferred to stay in the capital, contributing to the Ottoman defeats. His inattentiveness to military affairs and harsh methods (including death sentences) towards his potential opponents caused him to lose the support of the sultan. On 21 March 1692, he was deposed. Final days and death Ali Pasha was first exiled to Gelibolu (a port on the Dardanelles strait, in modern Turkey) and then to the island of Rhodes (in modern Greece). However, when a rumor reached the sultan in Istanbul that he had plans return (or revolt), he was executed in Rhodes in 1693.

It was the first of the independently built BTC-T cars to race, being ready in time for the first round of the season. Despite originally intending to run 4 BTC-T spec and 2 Production spec cars, only 2 BTC-T cars were ever entered in one event, and no Production spec car was ever built. The team had 4 different drivers across the season: the experienced David Pinkney (rounds 1-4) and Tim Harvey (rounds 3-4 and 9-13) sharing drives with the younger Mark Blair (rounds 10-11) and Tom Ferrier (rounds 2, 7-9 and 12-13). Darren Malkin had been announced, before the season started, as one of the drivers; however, he never made an appearance. The 147 proved to be unreliable, racking up 16 DNFs across the season, failing to start seven other races, and a multitude of other reliability gremlins. Despite this, the car was reasonably competitive - Harvey taking a surprise podium at the feature race at Oulton Park, albeit in a race marred by attrition, and Ferrier was running in a fine second place at Donington Park until engine failure ended his race. Harvey was the most successful driver, finishing 8th in the Driver's championship, whilst JS Motorsport's 4th place in the Team's championship was more a reflection of the small grid than anything else. The team did not reappear for 2002, and the 147s were not raced again.

The farm was sold the site was unoccupied until 1860 when the college architect, William Wilkinson, was commissioned to lay out the northern part of the estate. The street was named after William Juxon, who was President of St John's College from 1621 to 1633. He was also the Bishop of London and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Building began in Juxon Street in 1876. The houses were designed to provide small homes for middle- class families. Much of the north side of the street was bought by Lucy's Eagle Ironworks also just to the north to house its staff. Many of the houses have also been for rented to students. Some houses at the west end of the street were demolished and flats was constructed in their place. It is now a popular inner-city residential street with high prices and rents in the area.

Understanding the theory and practice of PSM is important in determining the motivations of individuals who choose careers in the government and non-profit sectors despite the potential for more financially lucrative careers in the private sector.  Common Models   How Public Service Motivation (PSM) is Used  PSM helps employees get the most out of their job experience and is rapidly evolving to work towards employee goals and organizational needs effectively. Efforts to manage employee behavior within government organizations by focusing on financial rewards may not have the desired effect and could potentially have a negative impact on employee motivation and performance seeing as how those that do work in the public sector are usually not motivated by financial gain. According to Perry, PSM in today's society is more about focusing on employee commitment to an organization rather than benefits of a higher salary. One way PSM output can be measured is by team performance which encourages individuals to engage in behaviors that are best for the team's success and productivity. Performance can be measured in different categories and various outcomes can be utilized in order to help the organization set goals and interpret the results to tweak their motivational techniques. One area or aspect of management that relies heavily on motivation is when an organization or company determines how to distribute rewards to employees. Gottfredson emphasized that rewards may be the most important tool that business leaders have to coordinate and motivate team members with the idea that rewards can be monetary or promotional, but motivation plays a key part in how hard employees will work to receive rewards.  Perry’s Public Service Motivation Scale  Public Service Motivation serves to provide the general public with an idea of what motivates individuals to choose career paths within the public sector as opposed to the private. Previous research emphasized that PSM was influenced by various social and political factors that ultimately drive employees to take an interest in the public sector. The history and concept of public service motivation has been studied by authors who contributed to the understanding of the practice itself such as Perry and Wise who coined the term PSM in 1990, and other political figures such as Woodrow Wilson who founded the field of Public Administration. Perry and Wise stated that PSM is often influenced by various social, political, and institutional factors and failure on the organization's part to recognize the motivation of its employees could lead to the discouragement of such individuals from the public sector.  Mission Valence  Mission Valence can be viewed as an employee's perception of the attractiveness or salience of an organization's purpose or social contribution. Mission Valence is a concept formulated by Rainey and Steinbauer in 1999 that serves to provide a better understanding of what compels an employee to uphold and achieve goals within their organization. Mission Valence enhances the satisfaction that an individual experiences or anticipates to receive from advancing the organizational mission, and in turn, it has the \\"potential to influence the ability of the organization to recruit, retain, and motivate its employees.\\" Ultimately, linking the organization's mission to the values and characteristics of the employee can increase the potential effects of PSM as members of the organization become committed to its success. Rainey and Steinbauer attribute mission valence to enhancing the satisfaction of an employee when the organization's mission or goal is achieved thus giving the employer the ability to motivate his or her employees and seek their retention. With the desire to help others, public employees are more likely to seek employment within a public organization because the particular mission of that organization often aligns with their own personal values. Previous studies enhance the notion that leadership along with effective management can increase employee mission valence through its ability to promote public service motivation.  Transformational Leadership  Transformational leadership moves away from a traditional management perspective that is based on self-interest and the exchanging of rewards for positive performance, and instead proposes the ideology of value based leadership to inspire and thus motivate employees. Although value based leadership is not new to the scope of public management, it is important to understand the evolution of how employers communicate the vision of the organization's purpose to their employees. Transformational leadership can motivate employees by appealing to their ideals and moral values, which in turn leads to a more effective and meaningful work environment. Transformational leaders create shared organizational value through \\"inspirational communication, ongoing practices, setting meaningful goals and designating significant work.\\" Paarlberg and Lavigna exclaim that linking transformational leadership and public service motivation to human resource management strategies will not radically improve the outcome of the workplace, but rather steadily transform management practices to garner the best organizational outcome to better motivate public sector employees.  The Role of Organizations in Promoting PSM  The impact of organizational institutions can either have a positive or negative ramifications on the motivational attitude of employees. According to Perry and Wise, whose theories contributed to the understanding of the ongoing relationship between one's overall motivation and the public interest, provided the widely accepted definition of PSM as an individual's \\"predisposition to respond to motives grounded primarily or uniquely in public institutions and organizations.\\" Under this definition, organizations have the duty and responsibility to foster an environment that allows employees to feel as if they are able to contribute to the general welfare of the public and can achieve their goals. Various scholars and researchers emphasize the role of organizations as an important aspect of PSM and indicate several factors that face employees on a regular basis that could either promote or hinder PSM. Perry and Wise specify those factors of an organization that influence PSM to include culture within an organization which can negatively be associated with PSM as hierarchical cultures tend to emphasize rule-based control of employees and bureaucratic personality, employees that experience red tape who often are characterized with lower levels of PSM as red tape includes rules regulations, and procedures that remain in force and entail a compliance burden, but do not advance the legitimate purposes the rules were intended to serve. Employees who had a lower level of job satisfaction were reported as more willing to tolerate red tape as opposed to those employees characterized with higher levels of PSM who were frustrated with the limitations of such constrictions. Educational level of organizational members reportedly had a positive relationship on the overall level of PSM of the individual. Wright, Pandey, and Moynihan emphasize that it is vital that organizational leaders understand the various factors that affect PSM in order help employees achieve their goals within the organization and provide for a better work environment.  Studies   Fields  Early authors in the field of public administration described differences between public and private employees and concerns over motivating public sector employees. citing de Tocqueville, Alexis (1856) L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution and Weber, Max (1922) Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Paul Van Riper described the issue in his 1952 history of the U.S. civil service system. Even Woodrow Wilson's seminal 1887 essay that founded the field of Public Administration expressed concern over the performance of civil servants. Much of Max Weber's work on bureaucracy focused on similar issues. Kaufman's The Forest Ranger introduced the idea of an organizational culture unique to government employees in the 1960s, which contributed significantly to the field of study., reprinted in 2006  Formulation  The concept of Public Service Motivation was formalized in the late 1970s and early 1980s by authors like Buchanan, Mosher, Perry, Porter, and Rainey; but the term was officially coined by Perry and Wise in 1990. Since then, PSM has gained international prominence from various scholars and researchers. PSM varies between employees, making it difficult to generalize the motivations of each individual who works in the public sector. Studies by Homberg, McCarthy, and Tabvuma attribute PSM to the positive impact on job satisfaction in the public sector because public employment helps satisfy individuals’ pro-social needs.Homberg, F., McCarthy, D. and Tabvuma, V. (2015), A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between Public Service Motivation and Job Satisfaction. Public Administration Review, 75: 711–722 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/puar.12423/abstract Previous authors that are familiar with motivational factors associated with the public sector suggests that many employees tend to characterize themselves with pro- social identities such as caring and compassionate. Researchers of motivational theory and management emphasize that individuals will go above and beyond to be viewed as \\"moral\\" or good by their peers and fellow employees, so finding pro-social ways to motivate individuals can be beneficial. Crewson argued that a responsive and cost-effective government should acknowledge that a failure to properly understand the motivations of public employees may have undesirable short term effects such as low job performance which may lead to long term effects such as the permanent displacement of the public service ethic. Rosenblatt noted that there is a surprising link between PSM and motivation. After closely observing employees in the public section, material indicated that when PSM encourages individuals it can spark innovation. When employees are rewarded for previous accomplishments in the workplace, they are motivated to do even more, although that motivation is not necessarily coming from a genuine place and instead comes from the desire to receive more rewards. Rosenblatt reaffirms the notion that individuals aren't to concern themselves with what their driving force for may be, whether they are making accomplishments because they want to be innovative or because they want to receive a bonus, the ends will ultimately justify the means.  Factors  Mann conducted a study among non profit employees and came to the conclusion that although there is a dichotomy within the public and private sectors, if an employee is working for a non profit organization he or she would be satisfied regardless of PSM or not. The reason behind this behavior is because employees who work for non profits already have a passion for the work that they do. According to Mann's study, even if these individuals didn't receive compensation, they would return to work the next day and work just as hard because they have intrinsic motivation that doesn't need to be externalized. Previous scholars and researchers warn that PSM can also be influenced by negative factors such as institutionalized values, routinization of behaviors, later republished in a modifies form in 1967 by Little, Brown and Company. and skepticism about the value of the particular bureaucracy's effectiveness in promoting the public good. Budget maximization and \\"empire building\\" were also scrutinized by Downs and Niskanen., reprinted in 2007 by Aldine Transaction.  Criticism and Alternatives   Leadership Practices  The agency's mission, goals, and objectives can help improve employee performance and motivation. Many employees who hold jobs within the public sector and non-profit organizations do not receive large salaries. It is important for an organization to motivate its employees and align their values and characteristics with the mission and values of the agency rather than subject employees to a stressful and hostile work environment motivated by financial gain. Leadership practices should emphasize to employees the importance of motivation and involvement which can ultimately help the agency or organization in the hiring and retention process if they are aware of the motives of their employees.  Surface Acting  Studies performed by various researchers attribute an individual's motivation with the individual level of stress and job dissatisfaction. These factors can lead to surface acting which is characterized by adjusting observable emotional expressions to mask true feelings, pretending to feel a desired emotion, and faking emotional displays. It is hard to evaluate the motivation of each individual working in the public sector when they exhibit a false persona. Representing an agency or organization in the public sector often requires one to display and act in a certain behavior and attitude. This behavior often leads to surface acting.  Emotional Labor  Situational factors such as the frequency of customer interactions, the duration of such interactions, career fields, customer hostility, and organizational expectations can all contribute to one's emotional labor. Emotional labor is the act of behaving or displaying specific emotions and behaviors within one's job profession. Employees are constantly under the influence of interactions between other employees and customers. Many citizens expect a certain level of satisfaction from each level of government which often burdens the employee with an immense amount of pressure to fulfill those expectations and who in turn will often face backlash and harsh criticism when citizens feel they are not satisfied.  Employment Relationship  If an employee finds themselves in a hostile, stressful work environment this can deter motivation and counteract productivity which can ultimately effect the individuals goals, expectations, and disrupt the balance of the workplace. Motivation stems from an individuals desire to satisfy the needs for automaton, direct communication between employees, and asocial inclusions. Having an open approach in the workplace can help new less experienced employees feel a sense of involvement and value which an ultimately increase their motivation to succeed and continue with the organization and vie for its success. As generational changes continue to occur and public sector employees rotate between positions, it is vital to understand how employment relationships can be improved in order to increase public service motivation. Nonprofit employees are becoming more similar to public employees based on motivational aspects such as intrinsic rewards.

It is the second capital city (after Guwahati, Assam) in Northeast India to be connected to the country's railway map, moreover Agartala is the first state capital of independent India to be connected with a rail network. Before 2015 the route was connected to Lumding with a meter gauge track, but after the gauge conversion in 2016, the track connected directly to Guwahati and the rest of India. From Agartala an under- construction track has been on the way for a connection towards the extreme Southern end point of the state at Sabroom, which has been completed on 3rd October, 2019. A total of 21 constructed stations and few under-construction stations in the state, with Churaibari being the last one through the Northern side and Sabroom (functioning & completed) in the Southern side. The total length of track from the capital towards the North region's last station is approx. , after which the territory of Assam starts. There are a lot of transportation modes available to reach the city from the station.  History  The northeastern state capital came on India's railmap with the advent of the railways in the subcontinent in 1853. The foundation stone of the Kumarghat-Agartala railway project was laid in 1996 by the former Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda, and during the laying of rail lines, provisions were kept for swiftly converting it to broad gauge. 40 years time was taken by the Government since then to connect Agartala by rail.

He had a long a successful career spanning from 1885 to 1928, which peaked in 1903 when he won the UCI Motor-paced World Championships. He competed internationally and married twice, to an Australian and to a German. Consequently, while he lived most of his life in Amsterdam, he also spent years in Germany and Australia. Biography He was born in Amsterdam to Pieter Casper Dikkentman, a carpenter, and Sophia Diederica Boekstal. After finishing school he trained as mechanical engineer. He began competing in cycling at the age 16 and specialized in sprint. He was noticed by Jan Mulder, who made him a member of his quint, a type of tandem bicycle ridden by a team of five cyclists. In this discipline Dikkentman won a world title in 1898, and set a new world record (500 meters in 28.6 seconds) in 1899. Around that time he became professionally involved in motor-paced racing. This event was difficult for him, as he had 10 crashed during his career as well as a strong rivalry with the German cyclist Thaddäus Robl; this rivalry, however, made him famous in Germany. Especially difficult was for him the 1904 season when he had a long recovery after being hit by a pacer. Nevertheless, he won three medals at the UCI Motor-paced World Championships, in 1901, 1903 and 1905, including a gold medal in 1903, as well as five European medals (in 1900, 1901, 1903, 1904 and 1907). After these successes, Dikkentman, who was a self-managing professional cyclist, became a wealthy man. Yet, for many years he kept a strict daily routine of training and diet. He also followed all technical developments in the design of bicycles and pacing motorcycles. However, his career declined in the late 1900s due to the lack of a good pacer, and he eventually retired in 1913. Dikkentman competed all around the world, including Japan and Australia. On 27 February 1908 he married Lilian Brasker, an Australian. The couple had a daughter, Edna Victoria (b. 1909 in South Yarra, Victoria), and divorced on 11 July 1917. On 14 March 1918 he married again, to Emilie Agnes Minna Zöphel, a German. They had one son and three daughters. While working at his bicycle shop, Dikkentman could not stand the retirement and returned to cycling in the 1920s, finishing in second-third place in the national motor-paced championships in 1921–1923. In 1927, he won a race in Amsterdam in a record time. He retired from active cycling after a race in Szczecin, Poland, on 28 October 1928, aged 49. He continued competing as a pacer, but without much success. In his late years he ran a bicycle shop in his native Amsterdam, where he died in 1950.

It ended with the Polish victory when, after a two- month siege, the Prussian and Russian army ended the siege and withdrew from Warsaw. Background Warsaw, the capital of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was one of the key strategic areas for all sides in the Kościuszko Uprising. Secured by the Poles during the Warsaw Uprising in April, it was threatened by the forces of the Imperial Russia and Kingdom of Prussia. The leader of the Uprising, Tadeusz Kościuszko, gathered forces to defend Warsaw, and around 7 to 11 July fought a delaying battle at Raszyn. Opposing forces Kościuszko was able to gain some time to finish preparation for the upcoming siege, dividing his forces into the field army (23,000), garrison (3,000) and city militia (18,000). Another estimate gave him 35,000 men and 200 guns. The field army had a line of field fortifications and trenches prepared outside the main city walls and fortifications. The besieging forces were commanded by King Frederick William II of Prussia, whose army numbered about 25,000 and 179 guns, with a Russian army of about 65,000 and 74 guns under Johann Hermann von Fersen. Another estimate gives the Prussian size at 30,000 and the Russian, at 13,000. Siege The attackers decided to delay their assault, waiting for heavy artillery. They launched their first attack on July 27 in the direction of Wola, but were pushed back by a division under Prince Józef Poniatowski. To relieve the pressure of the siege, Kościuszko ordered the Uprising in Greater Poland, which succeeded in disrupting the Prussian forces. Kościuszko became more radical in his political influence, endorsing the Polish Jacobins to gather more popular support. The second assault by the besieging Prussian and Russian armies on 26 to 28 August was also defeated, and with the spreading of unrest in Greater Poland, Frederick William II ordered his forces to end the siege and withdraw. The Prussians would retreat to the Bzura river, while the Russians, under von Fersen, would camp near the southern Pilica river region. The Polish victory at Warsaw is seen as one of the major accomplishments of Kościuszko, and one of the two greatest Polish victories in the Uprising, second to the success of the Greater Poland Uprising itself, which was inspired by the siege. Aftermath Despite this victory, the Uprising would soon end with Kościuszko's defeat at the battle of Maciejowice in October followed by the bloody taking of Warsaw in November.

Location The residence is located in Kangdong-gun, a suburban county of Pyongyang, around northeast of Kim Il-sung Square. Taedong River is just to the north. The size of the whole leadership complex is around . According to Kim Jong-il’s former bodyguard Lee Young-kuk there are at least eight North Korean leader’s residences outside Pyongyang.  Description The compound was constructed in the 1980s and expanded in the 1990s under the order of Kim Jong-il. It contains buildings for Kim Jong-il, his late wife Ko Yong-hui, his sister Kim Kyong-hui and his brother-in-law Jang Sung-taek. The area is mostly used as summer residence, to spend holidays or for parties with close officials. The estate has an elaborate garden, set around many lakes. There are numerous guest houses, and a banqueting hall. The whole compound is a maximum security area, surrounded by two armored fence lines with guards huts and checkpoints, clearly visible on satellite pictures. Kim Jong-il’s former cook Kenji Fujimoto worked and lived in a guest house within the compound and provided some photographs dated 1989. Analysis of satellite pictures showed that the area changed significantly since then and even after 2006 new buildings and a new railway station were established. Defectors reported that in Hyangmok-ri, not far from the residence and from the Mausoleum of Tangun, Kim Jong-un’s birthplace is being built, though he was actually born in Changsong, North Pyongan Province.

Life In 1850, still a student, Isachsen briefly edited the student-society newspaper Samfundsbladet alongside the future playwright Henrik Ibsen. On 18 January 1852 he made his debut as an actor at Det norske Theater in Bergen as Ruy Gomez in the one act play Man kan hvad man vil (One can what one wants). He was employed in Bergen until 1858, when he left the stage for a time. On 10 November 1853, in Bergen, he married the actress Janny Grip (1835-1894). He resumed acting in 1860 at the Christiania Norwegian Theatre, then under Ibsen's artistic direction. He remained in that company until the theatre went bankrupt in 1862, on which he moved to the theatre in Trondheim. In 1865 he returned to the Christiania Theatre, but joined Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's walkout to the Folketheater at Møllergaten, where he acted from September 1870 to February 1872. From 1872 until his retirement from the stage in 1894, Isachsen remained at the Christiania Theatre. Isachsen was known as a character actor with a particular talent for comedic roles. Isachsen argued with Ibsen over an 1873 play reading of Emperor and Galilean held at Christiania on his own initiative. He had previously held readings of lyric poems by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Moe, receiving praise for them from Asbjørnsen himself. Relations between Isachsen and Ibsen remained soured for the rest of Isachsen's career - Ibsen wrote a letter to the theatre's management specifically demanding that \\"the terrible Isachsen\\" would not be given any parts, since Ibsen felt he had a tendency towards over-acting and caricaturing roles.

Background Texas expungement lawTexas Code of Criminal Procedure, Chapter 55 allows expungement (referred to as \\"expunction\\" Texas statutes) of criminal records which did not lead to a finding of guilt, certain class C misdemeanors when the defendant successfully completed deferred adjudication, successful completion of deferred prosecution agreements. If the defendant was found guilty, pleaded guilty, or pleaded no contest, they will not be eligible for expungement; however, it may be eligible for non-disclosure (more commonly referred to as record sealing) in the circumstances outlined below. The Texas Young Lawyers Association and State Bar of Texas provide an informational packet about expungement as a service to the public. Juvenile offenses Juvenile offenses potentially eligible for expungement include \\"misdemeanor[s] punishable by fine committed prior to the age of 17, [offenses] committed by [minors] under the Alcoholic Beverage Code and [convictions] for Failure to Attend School\\" under the Education Code. Disqualifying factors can include multiple convictions and insufficient age. Release, dissemination, and admissibility The release, dissemination or use of expunged records by any agency is prohibited. Unless being questioned under oath, the defendant may deny the occurrence of the arrest and expungement order. If questioned under oath, the witness may only respond the matter was expunged. Legislation The 76th Texas Legislature rejected a bill that would have expanded access to expungement. The 78th Texas Legislature failed to gain consensus for HB-384, which would have granted automatic expungement in the cases of acquittal, pardoning, or upon dropping of charges. The 82nd Texas Legislature's passing of HB-351 and SB-462 reformed the expungement code to include relief for those convicted but later determined to be innocent. Alternative remedies Those ineligible for expungement may still seek an Order of Nondisclosure under some circumstances. Texas Record Sealing (also known as Orders of Nondisclosure) Petitioning the court for an Order of NonDisclosure is often the best option for those that are not eligible for an expungement/expunction in Texas, and typically used in situations where a sentence of deferred adjudication was imposed by the court.https://www.txcourts.gov/media/1439434/overview-of-orders-of- nondisclosure-2017.pdf With some exception, expungements are typically intended for situations where there was no finding of guilt. In other words, expungements are for when you've been found not guilty, your charges have been dismissed, your conviction was overturned on appeal, or you were arrested but never charged.https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CR/htm/CR.55.htm The exceptions to this general rule are for when you've successfully completed deferred prosecution, or when you've successfully completed deferred adjudication for a Class C Misdemeanor. An Order of Non-Disclosure does not completely eradicate your record like an Order for Expunction, but seals and generally removes it from the public domain. Your record may be visible to certain government agencies listed below, but it will be removed from the public domain and not appear in most background checks. After Tex. Gov't Code Section 411.0765 was amended in 2017, Texas law specifically allows for the disclosure of sealed records to most criminal justice agencies and these noncriminal justices agencies: * The State Board for Educator Certification; * School districts, charter school, private school, regional education service center, commercial transportation company, or education shared service arrangement; * The Texas Medical Board; * The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired; * The Board of Law Examiners; * The State Bar of Texas; * A district court regarding a petition for name change under Subchapter B, Chapter 45, Family Code; * The Texas School for the Deaf; * The Department of Family and Protective Services; * The Texas Juvenile Justice Department; * The Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services; * The Department of State Health Services, a local mental health service, a local intellectual and developmental disability authority, or a community center providing services to persons with mental illness or intellectual or developmental disabilities; * The Texas Private Security Board; * Municipal or volunteer fire departments; * The Texas Board of Nursing; * Safe houses providing shelter to children in harmful situations; * Public or nonprofit hospital or hospital district, or a facility as defined by Section 250.001, Health and Safety Code; * The securities commissioner, the banking commissioner, the savings and mortgage lending commissioner, the consumer credit commissioner, or the credit union commissioner; * The Texas State Board of Public Accountancy; * The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation; * The Health and Human Services Commission; * The Department of Aging and Disability Services; * The Texas Education Agency; * The Judicial Branch Certification Commission; * A county clerk’s office in relation to a proceeding for the appointment of a guardian under Title 3, Estates Code; * The Department of Information Resources but only regarding an employee, an applicant for employment, contractor, subcontractor, intern, or volunteer who provides network security services under Chapter 2059 to:(A) * The Department of Information Resources; or(B) a contractor or subcontractor of the Department of Information Resources; * The Texas Department of Insurance; * The Teacher Retirement System of Texas; * The Texas State Board of Pharmacy; * The Texas Civil Commitment Office; * A bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, or mortgage banker, a subsidiary or affiliate of those entities, or another financial institution regulated by a state regulatory entity listed in Subdivision (18) or by a corresponding federal regulatory entity, but only regarding an employee, contractor, subcontractor, intern, or volunteer of or an applicant for employment by that bank, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, mortgage banker, subsidiary or affiliate, or financial institution; and * An employer that has a facility that handles or has the capability of handling, transporting, storing, processing, manufacturing, or controlling hazardous, explosive, combustible, or flammable materials, if:(A) the facility is critical infrastructure, as defined by 42 U.S.C.

Their morphology is variable and ranges from small, simple, hill- like elevations to large, complex, winglike projections. Epipophyses provided large attachment areas for several neck muscles; large epipophyses are therefore indicative of a strong neck musculature. The presence of epipophyses is a synapomorphy (distinguishing feature) of the group Dinosauria. Epipophyses were present in the basal-most dinosaurs, but absent in the closest relatives of the group, such as Marasuchus and Silesaurus. They were typical for most dinosaur lineages; however, they became lost in several derived theropod lineages in the wake of an increasingly S-shaped curvature of the neck. Several scientific papers have observed that epipophyses were present in various non-dinosaur archosauromorphs. These include several pseudosuchians (Batrachotomus, Revueltosaurus, Xilousuchus, Effigia, Hesperosuchus), basal avemetatarsalians (aphanosaurs) non-archosaur archosauriforms (Vancleavea, Halazhaisuchus), rhynchosaurs, several tanystropheids, and allokotosaurs. Sauropod-oriented paleontologist Mike Taylor has informally suggested that epipophyses were also present in the vertebrae of certain pterosaurs.

History Standing on a hill to the south of the village, the grain mill dates back to c. 1650. Hans Mortensen acquired it in 1726, operating it for the next 44 years. In 1743, he rebuilt the mill, recording the date on an interior beam around a heart containing his initials (HMSM) together with those of his wife (AMPD) Anna Margrethe Pedersdatter. Mortensen must have been a thrifty individual. On his death at the age of 65, in addition to a chiming clock, an iron stove, a four-poster bed, a Bible and a German prayerbook, he left an amount of over 793 rigsdaler, an exceptionally high amount of money for a farmer of his day.

The client is guided to analyse and reflect on video clips of their own interactions.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRVaL_ZlxHs Applications include a caregiver and infant (often used in attachment-based therapy), and other education and care home interactions.http://www.nspcc.org.uk/news-and- views/our-campaigns/current-campaigns/neglect/olwen-prince/olwen-prince-video- interaction- guidance_wda95063.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKaDMreSlb0#t=219 VIG is used in more than 15 countries and by at least 4000 practitioners. Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. History Colwyn Trevarthen, a Professor at Edinburgh University, studied successful interactions between infants and their primary care givers, and found that the mother's responsiveness to her baby's initiatives supported and developed intersubjectivity (shared understanding), which he regarded as the basis of all effective communication, interaction and learning. In the 1980s Harry Biemans, in the Netherlands, applied this research using video clips, creating VIG. Research results Research results include that VIG enhances positive parenting skills, decreases/alleviates parental stress, increases parenting enjoyment, improves parental attitudes to parenting, and is related to more positive development of the children, although the effect at child-level is reduced in high-risk families.http://spinusa.net/Video%20feedback.pdf One study found an increase in sensitivity of mothers but no impact on infant attachment.Velderman, K. et al. (2006) Effects of Attachment-Based Interventions on Maternal Sensitivity and Infant Attachment: Differential Susceptibility of Highly Reactive Infants. Journal of Family Psychology, 20, 266-274, referred to in VIG has also been found to increase the child sensitivity of teachers.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479867_Effects_of_Video_Interaction_Guidance_on_early_childhood_teachers The limitations of the experimental studies undertaken so far, such as their small number of subjects, are acknowledged, and more research is needed.Video Interaction Guidance, Kennedy et al, published JKP 2011 Research linking VIG use to better subsequent long-term mental health of the child has not been published, but parenting is a causal risk factor for mental illness, and some mental health NGO's are pursuing programmes on expectation of a positive link. Video Interaction Guidance has been used where concerns have been expressed over possible parental neglect in cases where the focus child is aged 2–12, and where the child is not the subject of a child protection plan. Am evaluation of the project demonstrated that VIG produced a significant change in the emotional and behavioural difficulties of the population of children who received the service, and improvement in reported level of parenting and reported parental relationship with their children in the population of parents whose children received the service. The data excludes to parents who failed to complete the programme, parents who completed the programme but decided not to complete evaluation measures, and on some measures parents who completed measures but whose feedback was adjudged to have been positively biased. Parents also reported developing a better understanding of the following aspects of good parenting: · Giving each of their children one-to- one time. · Giving children space to make choices and develop skills. · Listening to children and not interrupting. · Making eye contact when talking to children. · Taking children out to parks and finding activities for them to do. · The importance of good relationships between separated parents. Theories of effectiveness Theories of why VIG is effective includes that the use of video clips enables a shared space to be created, where positive sensitivity and attunement moments can be seen. This allows clients to improve their relationship attunement skills, by developing their ability to mentalise about their own and their infants mental states, and by encouraging mind- minded interactions.http://videonet.fi/mll/20130315/2/kennedy.pdf (Trevarthen focuses particularly on how babies seek companionship, rather than using the term attachment, and has said \\"I think the ideal companion... is a familiar person who really treats the baby with playful human respect.\\")  Understanding the mechanisms through which Video Interaction Guidance works  Qualitative research studies have also illuminated some of the ways in which Video Interaction Guidance can help individual parents.  Social learning theory in action  Evaluations have demonstrated that in certain cases parents have learned to improve their parenting in the way described by social learning theory. Social Learning Theory suggests people learn by observing positive desired outcomes resulting from the observed behaviour.Churchill, G. (2015) Safecare: Evidence from a Home Based Parenting Programme for Neglect, London, NSPCC. https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research- reports/safecare-evidence-evaluation-report.pdf Parents, with several children, who traditionally spent all their time with the children with the children together in the group, started spending one-to-one time with individual children, after having been required by Video Interaction Guidance, to do one-on-one activities with a particular child, for the first time. Some parents started to do activities with their children, which involved a small element of risk, after having agreed to do them for the first time as part of Video Interaction Guidance. Similar findings are reported in an evaluation of the Triple P intervention.Whalley, P. (2015) Child neglect and Pathways Triple P: An Evaluation of an NSPCC services offered to parents where initial concerns of neglect have been noted, https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/pathways- triple-p-evaluation-report.pdf  The importance of the relationship between the practitioner and the parent  A principal factor which influences parents' engagement and perception is the quality of the relationship that they are able to build up with the practitioner delivering the programme. Key factors in helping practitioners engage parents into the intervention include: * Establishing a sense that the practitioner will support the family beyond what is necessary to complete the intervention. * Giving family members time to talk about their problems both during and out of appointments. * Advocating for the family on issues with which the intervention is not directly concerned. * Ensuring that fun forms a part of the interaction. * Making family members feel cared for through the provision of clothes, food and gifts. * Giving parents a lead in analysing family functioning and parenting. * Carrying out the intervention in the home of the parent. * Practitioners working on weekday evenings. In the case of Video Interaction Guidance, when parents were asked about their experience of the intervention, parents invariably referred to the care and support provided by the practitioner. Effectively the intervention is experienced as an aspect of the overall relationship of care. Recommendations and use VIG is recommended in the UK by NICE (the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) and is one of two interventions recommended by the NSPCC to improve parenting. It is also recommended for health visitors.http://www.journalofhealthvisiting.com/cgi- bin/go.pl/library/abstract.html?uid=103247 The European Union DataPrev database also recommends VIG. VIG is used by NHS and other health services providers.http://www.whatsthedealwith.co.uk/great- yarmouth/professionals/video-interactive-guidance- vighttp://thekneehighproject.com/2014/03/11/team-update-new-moments/ In 2014 the UK NGO Mental Health Foundation and partners began to use VIG in an early years intervention to prevent mental illness in later life. Training AVIGuk, a UK 'association of supervisors', manages 18 month training programmes in the UK. Most research results have involved guiders who have undertaken such training. In the United States, SPINUSA, the national training institute for VIG trains agency staff and supervisors in applying the model for parent education, family therapy, staff training and development and leadership development. Criticisms VIG has been criticised for only focusing on positive factors, but this criticism has not been substantiated in terms of making VIG ineffective.https://www.theguardian.com/social-care- network/2011/nov/30/benefits-video-interactions-social-work The length and cost of the VIG training that AVIGuk provides has been criticised, on the grounds that this limits scalability and prevents wider use of VIG. This is shown in the emergence of similar video feedback interventions with much shorter training, such as Video Enhanced Reflective Practice (VERP), a particular application of VIG,http://www.verp.uk.com/VERP.php and Video- feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD),http://www.leidenattachmentresearchprogram.eu/vipp/en and other 'introductory' VIG courses.http://www.nscap.org.uk/assets/news/38-na_link_file- VIG%20Training%20Flyer%20and%20Application.pdf See also * Attachment-based therapy * Attachment theory * Attachment measures * Attachment in children * Child psychotherapy * Mental health * Colwyn Trevarthen * Mental illness References Category:Parenting Category:Infancy Category:Interpersonal relationships Category:Relationship counseling ","title":"Video interaction guidance"},{"id":"37928743","title":"Love and War (Tamar Braxton song)"},{"id":"37928757","text":"The term Nyönpa ( \\"mad one(s)\\"; Sanskrit avadhūta) may refer to a group of Tibetan Buddhist yogis or a single individual belonging to this group. They were mainly known for their unusual style of teaching, to which they owed their names. Spiritual practices of the Nyönpa Recent scholarship has helped to illuminate many distinguishing features of the religious practices the Nyönpa; these practices are sometimes referred to in the literature as The Practice of Observance.See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015) The Practice of Observance takes as its foundation the philosophy of tulshuk or chöpa or even tulshuk chöpa.See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015) This religious philosophy is the common thread in the following spiritual practices of the Nyönpa:See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015) The Nyönpa is essentially a free spirit who follows the rule of spontaneity and intuition, not subject to any external book of rules....he is one dedicated to renunciation and the path of enlightenment who does not fit within the disciplines and practises of the formal orders. *wandering homeless and taking on a new style of dress and a new mental attitude towards the world; *consuming substances considered impure; *drinking alcohol and eating meat; *singing and dancing; *behaving fearlessly; *engaging in sexual relations. * None of the practises listed above should be taken as mandatory. Practices that a Nyönpa may avoid include: *reading spiritual texts; *reciting prayers in the usual ways. Some Nyönpa were also famous for the practice of Chöd. List of some known Nyönpa There are some recorded historical descriptions of those exhibiting the behavior and spiritual practice of the nyönpa in both Tibet and India including: *Drukpa Kunley *Gendün Gyatso, the Second Dalai Lama *Kalapa, the \\"Handsome Madman\\", one of the 84 Mahasiddas *Mekhala and Kankhala, often called the \\"Two Headless Sisters\\", also part of the group of the 84 Mahasiddas *Thang Tong Gyalpo *Tsangnyön Herukahttps://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Tsangnyon- Heruka/6856 *Ü Nyön Kunga ZangpoSee DiValerio (2015) and DiValerio (2016) Women and the path of the Nyönpa There is evidence that women also took inspiration from the spiritual practices and ways of conduct of the Nyönpa. The most famous Tibetan woman exhibiting signs of the path of the Nyönpa would be the Tibetan female saint Sönam Peldren who probably lived in the 14th century.See Bessenger, 2016 Sönam Peldren was eventually understood as an emanation of Vajravārāhī in the female tulku incarnation lineage of the Samding Dorje Phagmo.Bessenger (2016) and Diemberger (2007) Before this, in India, there were three women in the grouping of the 84 Mahasidda whose spiritual behavior would indicate that they practiced according to this spiritual path. They are Lakṣmīṅkarā, the \\"Crazy Princess\\", and the \\"Two Headless Sisters\\" Mekhala and Kanakhala. Further reading *Ardussi, J. & Epstein, L.

Football career Browning was born in Kettering and played his early football for his home-town club before joining Queens Park Rangers in the 1910 close season, although he did not sign a full-time contract until 8 October that year. At Q.P.R., he was a regular scorer during his first season and was the club's top-scorer in the 1910–11 season with 18 goals. His scoring dropped off during his second season with the club, where he only scored once in ten games played, in a draw against Watford on 22 January 1912. However, he would form part of the Q.P.R. team which won the Southern Football League during 1911–12. He did not play in Ranger's subsequent FA Charity Shield loss against Blackburn Rovers. The following season, he again scored only once for Rangers in twelve games. In February 1913, his previous goalscoring form attracted him to fellow Southern League club, Southampton who were having difficulty filling the inside-left position, having used eight different players so far that season. Browning was immediately drafted into the first-team, making his Southampton debut at West Ham United on 15 February. Although match reports described him as \\"a clever forward with an accurate shot\\", Browning was unable to reproduce his previous goalscoring form and after six matches, with only one victory, he was dropped in favour of Bill Sanders, a soldier on loan from the Royal Artillery at Portsmouth. In the summer of 1913, Browning was released and returned to West London to join Brentford, for whom he failed to make an appearance. Later career During the First World War, Browning served in the Middlesex Regiment and later the Agricultural Labour Corps. He then settled in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, where he worked as a coal-miner, playing as a permit player for Bream Amateurs.

Career Born to a Kyoto family that ran a long-standing wagashi store, Inabata attended the Kyoto-fu Shihan Gakkō (now the Kyoto University of Education) and in 1877 earned a scholarship to attend the La Martinière technical school in Lyon. One of his classmates there was Auguste Lumière, who was later one of the inventors of the cinematographe. After studying weaving and dying technology for eight years, Inabata returned to Japan in 1885 and, after teaching others about what he learned, started his own company, Inabata Senryōten (later Inabata & Co., Ltd.), in 1890. He later moved the company to Osaka and focused his business on dying military uniforms. Achieving success, Inabata later served as president of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OCCI) from 1922 to 1934, and became a member of the House of Peers. A bronze statue of him still stands in front of the OCCI. Inabata was also instrumental in the founding of the Institut Franco-Japon du Kansai (currently l’Institut français du Japon – Kansai) in 1926. Film business When Inabata returned to France in 1896, he met Lumière again and learned about the motion picture apparatus that he and his brother Louis had developed. Interested in the business opportunity, Inabata returned to Japan with a cinematographe, fifty reels of film, and François-Constant Girel, a Lumière technician. They then offered \\"the first paid exhibition of what was then called 'jido shashin' [moving pictures]\\" at the Nanchi Theater in Osaka on 15 February 1897. Although Thomas Edison's kinetoscope had been presented in Kobe the previous year, that was not a device for projecting motion pictures, so Inabata's screening is regarded as Japan's \\"first projected film programme\\". Since the cinematographe could both project and shoot motion pictures, Inabata was also the first Japanese to be involved in the shooting of films, some of which featured him and his family. He soon found the film business distasteful, however, and handed it over to Einosuke Yokota, who later founded Yokota Shōkai, one of Japan's first film studios.
