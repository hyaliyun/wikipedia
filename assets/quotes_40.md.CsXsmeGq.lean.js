In : . It is a muted chord that marks the off-beats or upbeats. As a rhythm guitar and mandolin technique, it is accomplished through chucking, in which the chord is muted by lifting the fretting fingers immediately after strumming, producing a percussive effect. Traditional bluegrass bands typically do not have a drummer, and the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments. The upright bass generally plays the on- beats, while the banjo keeps a steady eighth-note rhythm. The mandolin plays chop chords on the off-beats or upbeats. (see: boom-chick) By partially relaxing the fingers of the left hand soon after strumming, the strings are allowed to rise off the frets, and their oscillations are damped by the fingers. All strings are stopped (fingered); open strings are not played in chop chords. Guitar The \\"chuck\\" usually consists of a downward strum on the up beat notes. Alternatively, the bass note can be played and allowed to ring, with the remainder of the chord being \\"chucked\\" on the up beat.Dziuba, Mark (1997). Blues Guitar, . Alfred Music Publishing. . This technique is usually used in a rhythmically simple manner, such as chucking on every beat, or bass notes on down beats and chucking on up beats. Freddie Green and Django Reinhardt are known for this technique. Mandolin Mandolin \\"chunks\\", or more commonly known as \\"chops\\", rarely include a down-beat strum. When a mandolin is playing rhythm it is most often in conjunction with other instruments, such as guitar and bass, which produce the main beat. The mandolin contributes to the rhythm by producing a sharp \\"chunk\\" on the upbeat notes.\\"Bluegrass Instruments: Mandolins\\", PlayBetterBluegrass.com. Accessed August 7, 2014.

Career Williamson, representing the North Carolina Tar Heels, was the 1934 Southern Conference champion at both 880 yards and the mile. At the NCAA championships he placed fourth in the mile; as an upcoming talent, he was viewed as one of America's brightest hopes for the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1935 he placed second in the NCAA championship mile, losing by inches to Emporia State's Archie San Romani as both were timed in 4:19.1. At the 1936 Olympic Trials, however, Williamson opted for the 800 meters. He was up against world record holder and world leader Ben Eastman, NCAA and national champion Charles Beetham, returning Olympian Chuck Hornbostel and the eventual Olympic champion, John Woodruff. Woodruff ran a very fast 1:49.9 in the semi- finals and was followed home by Abraham Rosenkrantz and Eastman; Williamson qualified as third from the other, slower semi-final, won by Ross Bush. In the final, Williamson and Bush led the way for the first lap. Early in the second lap, Beetham collided with Marmaduke Hobbs, losing his chances; at almost exactly the same time, Rosenkrantz moved to the front. He was then passed by Woodruff and Hornbostel. Williamson closed with a fast sprint; while he failed to catch Woodruff or Hornbostel, he overtook Rosenkrantz at the very end, clinching the third and final Olympic spot in a time of 1:51.4. At the Olympics in Berlin Williamson won his heat. He also won in his semi-final, making his move in the backstretch to pass 1932 bronze medalist Phil Edwards of Canada.

It was his defection from Later Liang to Later Tang in 923 and subsequent offering of intelligence to Later Tang's emperor Li Cunxu that persuaded Li Cunxu to launch a surprise attack on the Later Liang capital Daliang that resulted in the fall of Later Liang, for which Kang was rewarded and given the imperially-bestowed name of Li Shaochen. He subsequently had major contributions in Later Tang's conquest of Former Shu as well. After Former Shu's fall, however, with Li Cunxu killing the major generals Guo Chongtao and Li Jilin (Zhu Youqian), Li Shaochen became apprehensive and decided to rebel, but was subsequently defeated and executed.  Background and defection to Later Liang  Kang Yangxiao was said to be a tribesman from the Daibei region (‰ª£Âåó, i.e., the region north of modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), who served as a soldier at Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). At one point, he was guilty of a crime, and he fled to Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 44. (While the accounts do not give a date for his defection, the fact that the History of the Five Dynasties referred to Xuanwu as \\"Bian Liang\\" () by its prefectural and regional designations, suggests that this occurred in the very late Tang Dynasty, when Hedong and Xuanwu were respectively ruled by powerful rival warlords Li Keyong and Zhu Quanzhong.) After Zhu Quanzhong seized the throne and established Later Liang as its founding emperor, Kang was gradually promoted in the soldier ranks. He had further military accomplishments during the reign of Zhu Quanzhong's son and successor Zhu Zhen.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 74.  Redefection to Later Tang  In 923, Zhu Zhen commissioned his general Duan Ning to prepare to launch a major attack on Later Liang's archrival Later Tang ‚Äî i.e., the successor state of what was the power bloc centered around Hedong, by this point ruled by Li Keyong's son Li Cunxu, who had just recently declared himself emperor. Kang Yanxiao was assigned as an army commander under Duan. Kang believed that Zhu was then overly trusting of his corrupt inner circle of officials, which would soon lead to destruction, and therefore secretly send letters to Li Cunxu's major general and adoptive brother Li Siyuan, offering to defect. In fall 923, he carried out his offer, taking some 100 of his cavalry soldiers and surrendered to Later Tang,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. rendezvousing with the Later Tang emperor at Chaocheng (ÊúùÂüé, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong). Li Cunxu took off his own silk robe and jade belt and awarded them to Kang, making him a commander in his own army against Later Liang, as well as the prefect of Bo Prefecture (ÂçöÂ∑û, in modern Liaocheng). Kang revealed that the Later Liang government was then highly influenced by Zhu's close associates, his brother-in-law Zhao Yan and four relatives of Zhu's deceased wife Consort Zhang. He further revealed to Li Cunxu that Duan had an ambitious four-prong plan to attack Later Tang, to be launched in winter 923, to try to reverse years of Later Liang losses at the hands of Later Tang's predecessor state Jin: # Dong Zhang would head toward Taiyuan. # Huo Yanwei would head toward Zhen Prefecture (ÈéÆÂ∑û, in modern Baoding, Hebei). # Wang Yanzhang and Zhang Hanjie (ÂºµÊº¢ÂÇë, Consort Zhang's brother) would head toward Yun Prefecture (ÈÑÜÂ∑û, in modern Tai'an, Shandong, which Li Siyuan had captured earlier in the year). # Duan himself, along with Du Yanqiu, would confront Li Cunxu himself. Kang pointed out the weakness of the plan ‚Äî that it divided up the Later Liang troops, making, in particular, Wang's and Zhang's army vulnerable. He advocated that, as Later Liang would be about to implement this plan, for Li Cunxu to rendezvous with Li Siyuan at Yun, and then head directly toward Later Liang's defenseless capital Daliang. With the concurrence of his chief of staff Guo Chongtao, Li Cunxu agreed. In winter 923, as Later Liang began to launch its attacks, Li Cunxu moved across the Yellow River and joined Li Siyuan at Yun. They then confronted Wang and Zhang at Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ, in modern Jining, Shandong), defeating and capturing them. Li Cunxu initially hesitated at heading toward Daliang directly, with most of his generals advocating by this point that he first capture Later Liang's coastal circuits. However, Kang insisted on the original plan of attacking Daliang, and with Li Siyuan concurring with him, Li Cunxu agreed, and headed toward Daliang. This caught Zhu by surprise, as Duan's four-prong attack plan left Daliang defenseless. As Later Tang forces approached, he, seeing the situation as hopeless, committed suicide, ending Later Liang. All of Later Liang territory surrendered to Later Tang, allowing Later Tang to absorb it. To reward Kang, Li Cunxu made him the defender of Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and bestowed on him both the imperial surname Li and a new personal name of Shaochen. In 924, Li Cunxu made him the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan).  Participation in the Former Shu campaign  In fall 925, Li Cunxu launched a major campaign against Later Tang's southwestern neighbor Former Shu, with his son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei in titular command, but with Guo Chongtao in actual command. Li Shaochen served as Guo's forward commander, commanding 3,000 cavalry and 10,000 infantry soldiers, joined by Li Yan ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. Li Shaochen quickly attacked the Former Shu city of Weiwu (Â®ÅÊ≠¶, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and forcing its surrender; he then advanced and captured Feng (È≥≥Â∑û, in modern Baoji) and Xing (ËààÂ∑û, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). When a major Former Shu counterattack force, under the commands of the generals Wang Zongxun (), Wang Zongyan (), and Wang Zongyu (), engaged him, he crushed them, forcing them to flee. He then headed directly for the major Former Shu city of Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan); the Former Shu major general Wang Zongbi abandoned the city and fled. He advanced further to Mian Prefecture (Á∂øÂ∑û, in modern Mianyang, Sichuan), and encountered an obstacle there ‚Äî that, while Former Shu forces had abandoned the city, they destroyed all the food supplies there, as well as the bridge over the Mian River (), which Mian Prefecture sat on. He chose to take only his cavalry soldiers, fording on their horses, across the river, at the great loss of life from drowning, believing that he needed to quickly advance toward the Former Shu capital Chengdu in order to give the Former Shu emperor Wang Zongyan no chance to rest and think. He then captured Han Prefecture (Êº¢Â∑û, in modern Deyang, Sichuan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 274. By this point, Wang Zongbi had become intent on surrendering to Later Tang, to save himself. He forcibly seized Wang Yan and the rest of the imperial household at Chengdu, and then made an overture to surrender on Wang Yan's behalf, addressed to Li Yan. Li Yan went to Chengdu, ascertained that in fact a surrender was forthcoming, and advised Guo and Li Jiji of the same. Li Shaochen thus stopped at Han to wait for Li Jiji and Guo. Wang Zongbi also arrived there to express his intent to surrender. They then headed toward Chengdu together, where Wang Yan formally surrendered, ending Former Shu. Later Tang took control of its territory.  Rebellion and death  Guo Chongtao, however, was closer to Dong Zhang, who also served in the campaign, than he was to Li Shaochen, and, despite Li Shaochen's great accomplishments in the campaign and higher rank than Dong, he consulted Dong on more decisions on the subsequent pacification of the Former Shu territory. Li Shaochen, in displeasure, publicly rebuked Dong several times and at one point threatened to find a reason to put Dong to death under military law. When Dong informed Guo this, Guo decided to exercise imperial authority Li Cunxu delegated to him and commission Dong as the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang) and relieve Dong's military responsibilities (so that Li Shaochen would not have any excuse to use military law against Dong). Further angered (believing that his military accomplishments entitled him to Dongchuan), Li Shaochen went to see Guo, ostensibly to recommend Ren Huan instead. Guo, instead, angrily responded, \\"Are you, Li Shaochen, rebelling? How dare you resist my decision?\\" Li Shaochen, in fear, withdrew from his presence. However, shortly after, Guo himself fell under deep suspicion by Li Cunxu and his wife Empress Liu (that he would rebel and take over the Former Shu lands), and even though Li Cunxu was hesitant to act against Guo without proof, Empress Liu herself issued an order to Li Jiji that he put Guo to death. Li Jiji did so, and subsequently, Li Cunxu also put Guo's allies, the major general Li Jilin (previously named Zhu Youqian) and Li Cunxu's own brother Li Cun'ai () the Prince of Mu, to death. The deaths of Guo and Li Jilin caused the army morale to plummet, and Li Shaochen himself, while not close to Guo, was shocked. He was further shocked when, as part of the order to slaughter Li Jilin's family, Li Cunxu ordered Dong, not Li Shaochen, to kill Li Jilin's son Zhu Lingde () the military governor of Wuxin Circuit (Ê≠¶‰ø°, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan). Further, many of Li Shaochen's subordinates were old subordinates of Li Jilin's, and they mourned his death and feared their own deaths (as a number of their colleagues still serving under Li Jilin were killed as well when Li Jilin was killed). They thus urged Li Shaochen to take action. Li Shaochen, who was then serving as the rearguard for Li Jiji on his journey back to the Later Tang capital Luoyang, thus decided to rebel. When he reached Jian Prefecture (ÂäçÂ∑û, in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan), he declared himself the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered at Chengdu), claiming to be displacing Meng Zhixiang, whom Li Cunxu had commissioned and who was already at Chengdu by that point. He was quickly able to get some 50,000 people of Shu to join him. Hearing of Li Shaochen's betrayal, Li Jiji stopped at Li Prefecture (Âà©Â∑û, in modern Guangyuan) and ordered Ren to attack Li Shaochen. Meng also sent his officers Li Renhan and Li Yanhou () against Li Shaochen. Li Shaochen looked at these forces lightly, particularly not taking Ren seriously in that Ren was a civilian official. However, Ren defeated him, forcing him into retreating to Han Prefecture and trying to defend it. Han, however, did not have heavy fortifications and was only protected by wooden fences, which Ren was then able to burn. Li Shaochen engaged him again and was again defeated. Li Shaochen fled, but was captured at Mianzhu (Á∂øÁ´π, in modern Deyang). He was delivered to Han, where Meng went to meet Dong and Ren and held a feast. He had Li Shaochen brought to the feast table in his jail wagon (i.e., a mobile jail cell mounted on the wagon), stating to Li Shaochen, \\"You, Lord, already held the staff and flag of a military governor, and also had great accomplishment in conquering Shu. Why do you fear that you were not going to be honored, and instead got yourself into this jail wagon?\\" Li Shaochen responded, \\"Chancellor Guo had the highest accomplishments, including conquering the two Chuans [(i.e., Dongchuan and Xichuan)] without dirtying his sword. But even he was killed even though he was sinless. How can someone like I, Li Shaochen, be assured that I would still have my head? That was why I did not dare to return to the imperial government.\\" Li Shaochen was subsequently delivered to Li Jiji, who continued his march back toward Luoyang. While Li Cunxu was himself shortly after killed in a mutiny at Luoyang, prior to his death, he dispatched the eunuch Xiang Yansi () to Li Jiji, ordering Li Shaochen's death, which was then carried out at Fengxiang (È≥≥Áøî, in modern Baoji).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275.

Indeed, the paucity of galleries in Douala in the 1990s prevented emerging artists from gaining visibility and experience. The first Squat‚Äôart took place in Bali in January 2001 and involved more than twenty artists. The second edition, which was a tribute to the artist Kuoh Eyango, was organised in De√Ødo from the 4th to 17 February. The organising committee, led by Kom√©gn√©, Essoukan and Viking invited over forty artists who produced and exhibited original works. Degrando Boutique, De√Ødo, Douala, Cameroon. * Espace Cr√©ateur.

The first served during the French Revolutionary Wars, capturing five privateers and several merchant vessels. The second served briefly at the start of the Napoleonic Wars. Both vessels operated in the Channel. The two cutters may have been the same vessel; at this juncture it is impossible to know. French records report that the French captured the second Lion in 1808 and that she served in the French Navy until 1809. First hired armed cutter Lion This vessel served on a contract from 30 March 1793 to 27 January 1801. She was of 85 tons (bm) and was armed with ten 3-pounder guns.Winfield (2008), p. 387. She may have been built in 1789. She was commissioned under Lieutenant W.R. Davies. In late 1793 Lion served in a small squadron under the command of Sir James Saumarez in the frigate , together with the frigate and the brig . They convoyed some transports with troops for Jersey and Guernsey, and their picked up pilots for Rear-Admiral MacBride. On 28 November Saumarez detached Lion to take the pilots to MacBride.Ross (1838), Vol. 1, p.119. Lieutenant Thomas Baker was appointed acting commander from December or perhaps January 1794. He served on her in the Channel as part of the forces under MacBride, before moving into the lugger Valiant on 20 May 1794. On 8 March 1795 Lion, while under the command of Nick Simmons (or Simmonds, or Symonds) captured the ship Apparencen. On 16 August 1796, Lion and the revenue cutter Swallow were four leagues ‚Äî ‚Äî west-southwest of Beachy Head when they observed a signal from the signal post alerting them to the presence of an enemy vessel. They set out in pursuit and captured a privateer lugger and her prize, a sloop. The privateer was armed with swivel guns and small arms, and had a crew of 17 men. She was three days out of St Valory and had only captured the sloop. The next month, on 12 September at 6a.m., Lion was three leagues ‚Äî ‚Äî southeast of Beachy Head when she spotted a French privateer cutter. Lion, under the command of her master, Nick Simmonds, immediately gave chase, but at 7a.m., the privateer, seeing that Lion was going to persist, came up, exchanges several shots with Lion, and the struck. The privateer was the Turot, of four 4-pounder guns, some swivel guns, and small arms, and 25 men under the command of Bernard Emanuel Turat. She was four days out of Havre de Grace and had not yet taken any prizes. (The name of the privateer was later corrected to Turo.) Three months later, on 15 December, Lion, still under the command of Nick Simmonds, captured a French privateer off the Owers after a four-hour chase. The privateer was the cutter Hazard. She was armed with two carriage guns, two swivel guns, and small arms, and had a crew of 17 men. She was two days out of F√©camp but had captured nothing. Then in the evening of 2 (or 3) February 1797, Lion, was off Dungeness Point, when she took possession of a French privateer sloop. Captor and prey were astern of a convoy that ranged to eastward. The privateer was the Requin, of Dieppe, armed only with muskets, and having a crew of 20 men. Lion was in company with the Dolphin, but it was Commander Bazely of who wrote the letter describing the incident, Harpy having arrived as Lion was taking possession of Requin. In late 1797 or early 1798, Lion was in company with the hired armed cutters Telemachus and Peggy when they captured the Ledia. On 18 May 1798 Home Riggs Popham led an expedition to Ostend to attack the sluice gates of the Bruge Canal. The expedition landed 1,300 troops under Major General Coote. The army blew up the locks and gates on the Bruges canal but was then forced to surrender. Lion, under the command of Lieutenant S. Bevel (or Bevill) was part of the naval portion of the operation. Lion carried some soldiers from the 23rd Regiment of Foot, which she landed, together with 15 of her crew. They carried some of the mines (explosives) used for blowing up the locks and gates.Corbett (1914), Vol. 2, p.346. On 16 November a French privateer appeared off Hastings. Captain Edward Henry Columbine was the commander of the Sea Fencibles for the area,Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.84. and Mr. Wexham, master of the Lion, volunteered his vessel to go after the privateer. Columbine put a number of Sea Fencibles aboard Lion, which set out in chase. Lion had to fire on the privateer before she would strike, which cost the life of one Frenchman. The privateer was the Success, of Cherbourg. She was armed with four guns and carried a crew of 24 men under the command of Nicholas Dubois, master. She had been out four days without having made any captures. Lion, and the hired armed cutters Dolphin and Lord Duncan were in company on 26 March 1799 when they recaptured the brigs Triton and Search. On 11 October Lion, under the command of Lieutenant William Yawkins, and the hired armed cutter Ann recaptured three small vessels. One of the three was the Elizabeth, of Whitby, Thomas Smith, master. Shortly after he was brought on shore at Deal, Captain Smith died of wounds he sustained when the privateer captured the Elizabeth. Smith's wife, who was on board at the time of the capture, arrived safely.WHITBY SHIPPING 1790 to 1799. ‚Äì Accessed 21 May 2013. Late in 1799, Lion was at Goeree-Overflakkee. Three Dutch vessels had taken refuge there and an overage merchant vessel, the Overyssel, was to be sunk at the mouth of the harbour to impede their escape. A sudden gale overturned the Overyssel, but a boat from Lion saved some of the crew.O'Brien (1902), p. x. At the end of December or in early January 1800, Lion took up station at Newhaven, at the behest of the merchants of Lewes, for the \\"protection of ships trading to and from that port\\".London Chronicle, (7‚Äì9 January 1800), p.30. In February 1800, Lieutenant W. Tatham, the former first lieutenant of , which was being decommissioned, was appointed to command Lion.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.231. In April Lion captured, off Scaford, Sussex, a smuggling vessel from Folkestone, with 500 pieces of contraband.London Chronicle, (8‚Äì10 April 1800) Vol. 87, p.342. In April, Lion captured the French fishing boats Julie and Recompense. Then on 17 June Lion and the sloop sailed from The Downs with a large number of merchant ships.London Chronicle, (26‚Äì28 June 1800) Vol. 87, p.613. Lion was anchored in St Aubin's Bay, Jersey in November 1800 when a severe gale came up on 9 November, which drove her onshore. Although several other vessels in the bay such as ,Lloyd's List, ‚Äì accessed 20 December 2013. suffered similarly, they were refloated. The schooner and the hired armed brig Telegraph got safely out to sea, though Telegraph had to cut away her mainmast.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, P.436. Havick, however, was so badly damaged that she was abandoned as a wreck.Hepper (1994), p.96. Neither Havick nor Pelican suffered any casualties, though the crews were subject to waves breaking over them for six hours until the tide, which had risen (perpendicular), providentially receded.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.518. Second hired armed cutter Lion This vessel served between 15 June 1804 and 23 August 1805. She was of 86 tons (bm) and carried eight 12-pounder carronades.Winfield (2008), p. 394. On 17 September 1804 Lion came into Portsmouth with a vessel with a cargo of salt that she had detained, and then immediately left again on a cruise.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 12, p.340. Lion arrived at Portsmouth on 22 January 1805 and reported that off Havre she had come upon a sloop floating keel uppermost. Lion had left the sloop Isle of Wight towing the vessel.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 13, p.162. French records report that French peniches captured Lion ca. 15 May 1808 off the Sables d'Olonne. The records describe her as having a displacement of 90 tons (French), and being armed with eight 12-pounder carronades. Lloyd's List of 27 May reported that several gunboats had captured the privateer Lion, of Plymouth, off the French coast.Lloyd's List, no. 4526 ‚Äì accessed 18 April 2015. (Readily available records of letters of marque do not show any contemporary one issued to any vessel matching Lions description.) The French navy employed Lion as a cutter and sold her c.1809.

Biography  Groombridge was born in Sarnia, Ontario in 1953. He attended Sheridan College in 1972, and continued at the Ontario College of Art (O.C.A., now OCAD University) from 1974 to 1978. In 1977 he became part of O.C.A.'s New York Off-Campus Study Program. Groombridge works in various media including screen-print, letterpress and sculpture. His work has been presented across Canada and abroad at venues including Het Apollohuis, Eindhoven, Netherlands; Cold City Gallery, Toronto; Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax; Plug In ICA, Winnipeg; and The Power Plant, Toronto.YYZ Artists' Outlet.

Art Practice  Brian Groombridge's internationally exhibited work is characterized by a reductive, minimalist style with subject matter inspired by historical sources such as facts, data and measurements that usually pertain to the art world. As Jen Hutton writes in her 2013 essay Galileo's Finger, \\"[Groombridge's] sculptures, installations, and wall works employ a strict rationality: hard edges, cool metals, and bright, smooth finishes. If there is decoration, it is austere. If there is text, it is extremely concise or merely a label.\\"Hutton, Jen. Galileo's Finger. Exhibition brochure, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Toronto, 2013 Groombridge's work often refers to the transient nature of things, and plays with the idea of fluctuation by presenting meaning and perception as flexible, not fixed. In a 2008 Globe and Mail article by Gary Michael Dault, Groombridge is quoted as saying \\"\\"I love the arrested moment. Meaning that moment when just to look at something stops it in its tracks‚Äîlike slicing one frame from a film.\\"Gary Michael Dault. Could this be a radio? Maybe just for today. The Globe and Mail, 8 November 2008 Groombridge's work combines poetic and literal elements to comment on select moments of history and life that are worthy of contemplation and respect.Lau, Yam. ‚Ä¶the wing span of an owl, enabling flight‚Ä¶ (rumination on the lives of two birds and a man). Exhibition brochure, YYZ Artists' Outlet, Toronto, 2013 In his work Groombridge also often refers to systems of knowledge such as measurement, geography and cosmology. As E. C. Woodley states in a 2013 review in Art in America, \\"Signs of engagement with the cosmos appear frequently in Brian Groombridge's work, representing a hunger for knowledge beyond ourselves and a faith in such knowledge even if it is minuscule compared with what we don't know.\\"Woodley, E.

It was constructed by the British military during World War II inside the Rock of Gibraltar and remains property of the Ministry of Defence to this day. The road allowed lorries to travel from the north to the south of Gibraltar entirely within the Rock. The tunnel still contains the remains of World War II buildings such as Nissen huts, kitchens, offices as well as a generating station and period anti-submarine nets. Background During World War II the British military constructed an underground bombproof city for 16,000 troops with enough supplies to last sixteen months, entirely within the Rock of Gibraltar. Facilities included a telephone exchange, a generating station, a water desalination plant, a hospital, a frozen food store, a bakery, ammunition magazines, a vast Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) shed where damaged vehicles and equipment could be repaired and roads. The road was built within a tunnel started when the 180 Tunneling Company of the Royal Engineers was created in 1940. The following year the 180 Company was joined by the 170 and 178 Companies. The road tunnel Map A Brigade Headquarters B Doncaster Adit C Calpe Hole Generating Station. North is to the left The tunnel starts at Maida Vale behind the old Casino at Europa Road and travels north behind the Rock Hotel to Brigade Headquarters and Doncaster Adit. At this point the road forks into several other minor tunnels dug to house kitchens and an ammunition magazine. The entrance to Wilson's Cave is also located here having been discovered while carrying out blasting the rock during the magazine's construction. The wide road continues north where it joins the Raglan Battery Shelter. The tunnel would allow military lorries to travel within the Rock. The Great North Road ends at the now abandoned Calpe Hole Generating station however, the tunnel system continues all the way to the north face of Gibraltar where the World War II tunnels join the Galleries dug out during the latter part of the 18th century, now known as the Great Siege Tunnels. With the addition of Fosse Way in 1944 it was also possible to travel from the tunnel system within the Northern Defences down the complete length of the Rock to emerge on the south east side of Gibraltar. After 1941 much of the spoil from mining was used for land reclamation into the Bay of Gibraltar to extend the runway of what is now Gibraltar International Airport to long and later to in length with a width of . Tunnelling created about 7,500 tons of spoil a day and the surplus was used for other land reclamation projects. The runway was required in order to carry out Operation Torch, the allied attack on French North Africa, from Gibraltar. In November 1942, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower set up his headquarters within the Admiralty Tunnel to plan the Allied invasion of North Africa which would lead with the help of Montgomery's 8th Army to capturing the whole of North Africa. After World War II The 1956 plaque commemorating the Royal Engineers centenary dinner at the tunnel In 1956 a dinner was served within one of the Great North Road's large side chambers to celebrate the centenary of the formation of the Royal Engineers. It was an apt celebration as the Royal Engineers can trace their history back to the Soldier Artificer Company which was formed on the Rock to dig Gibraltar‚Äôs first tunnels during its Great Siege. Today the tunnel system remains Ministry of Defence property and they are used to train troops for subterranean work. Guided tours can be arranged to view the remains of the World War II installations such as the kitchens, Nissen huts, the abandoned generating station and anti-submarine nets which would have been used to close off Gibraltar Harbour to protect the Allied ships berthed there. The approximately two-hour tour normally starts at Maida Vale, at an entrance behind the old casino on Europa Road, and proceeds through several large chambers visiting Brigade Headquarters and continues for almost arriving at the Calpe Hole Generating Station.

Keyboard amplifiers are distinct from other types of amplification systems such as guitar amplifiers due to the particular challenges associated with making keyboards sound louder on stage; namely, to provide solid low-frequency sound reproduction for the deep basslines which keyboards can play and crisp high-frequency sound for the high-register notes. Another difference between keyboard amplifiers and guitar/bass amplifiers is that keyboard amps are usually designed with a relatively flat frequency response and low distortion. In contrast, many guitar and bass amp designers purposely make their amplifiers modify the frequency response, typically to \\"roll off\\" very high frequencies, and most rock and blues guitar amps, and since the 1980s and 1990s, even many bass amps are designed to add distortion or overdrive to the instrument tone (for bass, this is called \\"fuzz bass\\"). Keyboard amplifiers differ from guitar amplifiers and bass amplifiers in that whereas guitar and bass amps are usually designed for use with one guitar at a time, keyboard amplifiers almost always have a mixer with inputs for two, three, or four keyboards, because many performers often use multiple keyboards. For example, a single player may perform with a stage piano, a keytar and a synthesizer keyboard. Each channel input typically has its own pre-amplifier and volume knob. Keyboards amps in the lower cost range and power output range may only provide equalization controls (for modifying the bass and treble response) for the overall mix. Higher-priced, higher power output keyboard amps designed for professionals may have equalizer controls for each channel. Keyboard amplifiers also differ from guitar amps and bass amps in that whereas many guitar and bass amplifier companies often sell standalone amplifier units (which contain a preamplifier and power amplifier) for use with one or more separate speaker enclosures, keyboard amplifiers are almost always combination (or \\"combo\\") amplifiers, so-named because they combine a preamplifier, power amplifier, full-range speaker, and a horn-loaded tweeter, all in a single wooden speaker cabinet. Two notable exceptions to the \\"low distortion\\" rule are keyboard amplifiers designed for the Hammond organ or clonewheel organs and amps used with electric pianos such as the Fender Rhodes. With organs used in blues or hard rock, performers often use the vintage Leslie speaker cabinet and modern recreations, which have a tube amplifier which is often turned up to add a warm, \\"growling\\" overdrive to the organ sound. With electric pianos used in a rock or funk band, natural tube overdrive is often added to the sound. Design A US Navy keyboardist playing his Yamaha keyboard through a large Roland keyboard amp. Since keyboards have a very wide range of pitches, from deep bass notes to very high treble notes, keyboard amplifiers have to provide solid low-frequency sound reproduction and crisp high-frequency sound reproduction. This distinction affects the design of the loudspeakers, the speaker cabinet and the preamplifier and amplifier. They usually include tuned bass reflex ports or vents for increased efficiency at low frequencies. Since keyboard amplifiers have to be able to reproduce very high notes, they are often equipped with a tweeter, which may be mounted in a horn. Comparison with guitar and bass amplifiers While electric guitar amplifiers are typically designed to modify the tone of the guitar (e.g., by adding distortion and rolling off high frequencies), keyboard amplifiers intended for general use for a range of keyboard applications usually have very low distortion and extended, flat frequency response in both directions. Electric guitar amp combos and amps are usually designed to add colouration to the guitar tone or \\"sweeten\\" the tone. Keyboard amp combos are usually designed to just reproduce the input signals. The exception to this rule is keyboard amplifiers designed for the Hammond organ, such as the vintage Leslie speaker cabinet and modern recreations, which have a tube amplifier which is often turned up to add a warm, \\"growling\\" overdrive to the organ sound. Electric piano players in rock and funk also often seek to add natural tube overdrive to their sound. Unlike bass amplifiers and electric guitar amplifiers, keyboard amplifiers are rarely used in the \\"amplifier head\\" and separate speaker cabinets configuration. Instead, most keyboard amplifiers are \\"combo\\" amplifiers that integrate the amplifier, tone controls, and speaker into a single wooden cabinet. Another unusual aspect of keyboard amplifiers is that they are often designed with a \\"wedge\\" shape, as used with monitor speakers. This permits them to be used as monitor speakers (with the amplifier in front of the seated keyboardist, aiming up at them) which is more suitable for a seated keyboardist. Design features BOSS micro-cube keyboard amp being used with a MIDI keyboard. Keyboard amplifiers often have an onboard three or four-channel mixer, so that multiple keyboards (e.g., a stage piano, synthesizer, and clonewheel organ) can be plugged into one amplifier and so that keyboardists can control the tone and level of several keyboards. In some genres, such as progressive rock, for example, keyboardists may perform with several synthesizers, electric pianos, and electro-mechanical keyboards. Keyboard amplifiers often have onboard reverb effects. Most inexpensive to mid-priced amplifiers currently produced are based on semiconductor (solid- state) circuits. Solid-state amplifiers vary in output power, functionality, size, price, and sound quality in a wide range, from practice amplifiers to professional models. The smallest, most inexpensive practice amplifiers may have only two channels with volume controls and one or two tone controls. Home practice amps have from 20 to 30 watts of power, often through an 8\\" or 10\\" speaker. Small keyboard amplifiers designed for small band rehearsals have 50 to 75 watts, a 12-inch speaker, and possibly a tweeter. Large keyboard amplifiers designed for shows in large clubs or halls have 200 to 300 watts of power, a 12-inch or 15-inch speaker (or two 12-inch speakers), and a horn- loaded tweeter. Some keyboard amps may be equipped with a compressor or limiter to protect the speaker from damage when the amplifier is being used at high volume levels. Some keyboard amps (e.g., Yorkville's 200 watt keyboard amp and Peavey's KB-4) have an extension speaker jack, which enables the amp to be connected to a second speaker cabinet for more volume. Use in performances In small venues such as a coffeehouse or small bar, a keyboardist might not connect the keyboard amp up to the PA system, and just use the sound of the keyboard amp to provide the keyboard sound for the venue. At most mid-sized venues and all large venues, such as stadiums, the signal from the keyboard amp's pre-amp out jack, DI out jack and/or the microphoned sound from the speaker and horn are fed to the mixing board and then amplified with the PA system or sound reinforcement system. In cases where a keyboardist has a rotating Leslie speaker, microphones are always used to pick up the sound, rather than taking an electronic signal from the amp, because only a mic can capture the unique sound of the Leslie's rotating horns and speaker drum. Comparison with PA systems In the 2010s, there is some convergence between the functionality of keyboard combo amplifiers and small PA systems. Some keyboard amplifiers have an XLR input for a microphone and a microphone preamplifier. To use a microphone, a preamp is generally needed to boost the power of the sigal, because mic's only output a tiny, weak signal. This input's inclusion of a preamp means that it could also be used to plug in an acoustic guitar's piezoelectric pickup. This type of keyboard amplifier could be used as a PA system by a singer-songwriter who is accompanying herself or himself on guitar and keyboards in a very small venue, such as a coffeehouse. Keyboard amps with an XLR mic input, preamplifier and a multichannel mixer are in effect small combo PA systems. While small combo keyboard amps with mic inputs became widely available on the market in the 2000s (decade), and were promoted as an innovation, in fact, the first portable PA systems sold in the 1920s and 1930s were \\"combo\\" systems, in which a power amplifier and speaker were combined in a single wooden cabinet. Instrument amplifiers from the 1950s and 1960s still sometimes included inputs for microphones, as few portable PA systems were available for garage bands during this era. By the 1970s and 1980s, though, portable PA systems were typically sold as three-piece sets: an amp-mixer containing a small mixer (with four to six channels) and a power amplifier integrated into a single amp head-style chassis with a handle, and two separate PA speakers. The speakers were typically connected to the amp- mixer with speaker cables. By providing separate speakers, this enabled bands to elevate the speakers and place them at either side of the stage, which improved sound dispersion over the former approach of using instrument amplifiers to boost both instrument and vocal sounds. There are several limitations on using a combo keyboard amp as a small PA system. First, it is hard to elevate a keyboard amp's speaker the way most PA speakers can be raised up, using PA system speaker stands with a pole onto which most small- to mid-sized PA speaker enclosures can be mounted using their base-mounted metal socket (a hole in a metal plate). Elevating a PA speaker above the audience helps to ensure that the sound is dispersed to the whole audience; if a combo keyboard amp is used as a small PA, the keyboard amp is typically placed on the floor or raised a bit by placing it on a table. In this scenario, the sound produced by the keyboard amp would be absorbed by the first several rows of audience members, and people in the back of the venue might not be able to hear the performance. Second, most small, low-wattage keyboard amps do not produce enough volume to clearly project the lead vocals into the venue so that they are at the \\"front of the mix\\", a sound preferred in many pop genres. For example, whereas a small PA system for a coffeehouse would typically have 100 watts, a small keyboard combo amp may only be rated at 20 watts. Third, while the vast majority of small PA systems come with two speaker cabinets, most combo keyboard amps have a single speaker cabinet. With two speaker cabinets, even if both are pointing straight out at the audience, this provides better coverage of the room; moreover, the two speaker cabinets can be angled outwards a bit, increasing the arc of coverage better for wide rooms. Stereo models While most keyboard amplifiers produce monophonic sound, a small number of higher-priced, higher wattage keyboard combo amps have two speakers and two horns and can produce stereophonic sound. When a stereo keyboard amp is used with a stereo chorus effect or Leslie speaker simulator pedal, this can produce a spacious, full sound. Some keyboard amp combos have a stereo link output, which can be connected to a second keyboard amp combo to provide stereo sound onstage. Use of subwoofer Keyboardists who want powerful low end may use a powered subwoofer cabinet designed for use in a PA system. Some keyboard combo amps have a \\"sub out\\" jack, so that the amp can be plugged into an external powered subwoofer cabinet for extra bass. Subwoofers can only produce deep bass frequencies up to about 150 or 200 Hz, so a subwoofer cabinet must be paired with a full range speaker to obtain the full tonal range of an electric piano or organ. Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on-stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards (which go down to a low \\"C\\" which is about 33 Hz) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub-bass parts that go as low as 18 Hz. Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage, synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches, because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ, which have as their lowest notes a low \\"A\\" and a low \\"C\\", respectively, a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave. A synth player can add lower octaves to a patch by pressing an \\"octave down\\" button, which can produce pitches that are at the limits of human hearing. Several concert sound subwoofer manufacturers suggest that their subs can be used for instrument amplification. Meyer Sound suggests that its 650-R2 Concert Series Subwoofer, a enclosure with two drivers, can be used for bass instrument amplification. While performers who use concert sound subwoofers for onstage monitoring may like the powerful sub-bass sound that they get onstage, sound engineers may find the use of large subwoofers (e.g., two 18‚Ä≥ drivers) for onstage instrument monitoring to be problematic, because it may interfere with the ‚ÄúFront of House‚Äù sub-bass sound. Rotating speakers A keyboardist playing a live show with a big Leslie cabinet (visible to his right). The Leslie speaker is a specially constructed amplifier/loudspeaker cabinet used to create special audio effects such as vibrato, chorus and tremolo. The Leslie creates these effects by rotating the tweeters or horns or a spinning a sound-directing duct around the bass woofer speaker, which causes the Doppler effect. Named after its inventor, Donald Leslie, it is particularly associated with the Hammond organ, but is used with a variety of instruments (notably electric guitar) and sometimes with vocals. The Hammond/Leslie combination has become a key element of the sound in many genres of music, including early heavy metal music (e.g., Deep Purple), blues, jazz organ trios and some rock genres. The Leslie Speaker and the Hammond Organ brands are currently owned by Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation. Due to the large size and heavy weight of the Leslie Speaker cabinet, some keyboardists use a small effects unit, such as the Uni-vibe, instead, and plug the unit into a regular keyboard amp. The most expensive rotating speaker effect units use digital modelling and digital signal-processing to produce a realistic-sounding recreation of the real Leslie speaker system. Other approaches Not all keyboard players use keyboard amplifiers to make their instruments audible on stage. Some keyboard players use a combo guitar amplifier, with a power amplifier and a speaker in a single wooden cabinet. The potential challenge with using guitar amps with keyboards is that a guitar amp is only designed to go down to about 82 Hz, the lowest note on an electric guitar, while an electric piano or Hammond organ may go down as low as 30 Hz. Playing these low keyboard pitches through a guitar amp may damage the speaker. Some keyboardists use bass amplifier combos for their stage sound. While bass amps can easily handle the low pitches of a keyboard instrument, bass combo amps from the 1970s and 1980s are less likely than post-1990s bass combo amps to have a speaker and a high-register horn. Horn-less vintage combo bass amps may not provide crisp, accurate reproduction of high-pitched keyboard sounds. A keyboardist using a Trace Elliot bass amplifier combo for her onstage sound. Another approach used by some keyboard players is to use a small PA system for their keyboards. This approach can work well, because small PA systems typically have four to eight inputs, which can accommodate a large keyboard setup with multiple keyboards (electric piano, Hammond organ, synth, etc.). The other benefit of using a PA system is that they use full-range speakers which contain a woofer and a tweeter, which are designed to reproduce the full range of sounds, from rumbling bass notes to piercing high notes. Some keyboard players use powered PA speakers (also called \\"active speakers\\") with their keyboards. Powered PA speakers are speaker enclosures with a built-in power amplifier and, in some cases, other electronic components. In the 2010s, there is a convergence between the functionality of powered speakers and small PA systems, because some powered PA speakers include a small mixer, an XLR input for a microphone, and a microphone pre-amp. While these powered PA speakers have full-range capability (as they contain woofers and tweeters) and they are robust enough for high- volume live music, some models are not designed to be portable, and so they lack carrying handles and metal-protected corners. These types of powered monitor speakers are more suitable for a fixed keyboard setup in a home studio, recording studio or music school. Selected brands Below the keyboard amplifier lineups of three mainstream brands are described. These lineups are described to give readers a sense of the range in size, speaker types and power (in watts) of standard keyboard combo amplifiers. These brands were chosen because they are widely available. Peavey Peavey's smallest keyboard amp is the KB 1. It has 20 watts, an 8\\" speaker, and \\"2 separate channels with a 2-band EQ per channel and a headphone out.\\" This amp would be suitable for in-home practice.

The theorem is named after Pat Moran, who stated it in a paper on the dynamics of the Canadian lynx populations. It has been used to explain the synchronization of widely dispersed populations. It has the important consequence for conservation ecology that viability of spatially structured populations is lower than one would expect from the local populations: it increases the probability that several local populations go extinct simultaneously.J√∂rgen Ripa, Theoretical Population Ecology and Evolution Group, Equation of the month: the Moran effect In its original form it stated: If the two populations have population dynamics given by :N_1(t+1)=f(N_1(t))+\\\\epsilon_1(t) :N_2(t+1)=f(N_2(t))+\\\\epsilon_2(t) where N_i is the population size of population i, f is a linear renewal function updating the populations in the same way, and \\\\epsilon_i the environmental variabilities. Then \\\\rho_{N_1,N_2}=\\\\rho_{\\\\epsilon_1,\\\\epsilon_2}. The original form assumed a strictly linear structure, but this assumption can be weakened to allow for non-linear functions. It has been suggested that the term \\"Moran effect\\" should be used for systems that do not strictly follow the original description.Esa Ranta, Veijo Kaitala, Per Lundberg, Ecology of Populations, Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 78 In the general case the correlations will be lower, and the accuracy of the Moran description depends on whether the populations tend to converge to an equilibrium state (good accuracy for low variance variability) or tend to oscillate (eventual breakdown of the correlation). It has been tested experimentally in a number of cases, such as variation of fruit production, acorn production, bird populations and coral reef fishes.

Its discovery made Montserrat into a pilgrimage destination, and led to the founding of the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey. The sanctuary of the Santa Cova is accessed by a path, called the Cam√≠ de la Santa Cova, carved along the ridge of the mountain. It was built between 1691 and 1704, thanks to the patronage of Gertrudis de Camporrell, marquess of Tamarit. Between 1896 and 1916, a series of sculptures were placed along the cam√≠, dedicated to the rosary and the 15 mysteries of the Virgin, including works by Antoni Gaud√≠, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and other modernista artists. Legend According to legend, on a Saturday evening in 880, two young shepherds observed a great light descend from heaven and settle halfway up the mountain of Montserrat. The light was accompanied by a beautiful melody. The following week, accompanied by their parents, they saw the same vision again. The vision continued to repeat in later weeks, even when the boys brought the rector of Olesa de Montserrat. In response, the priest alerted the Bishop of Manresa, and a cave was found which contained the icon of the Virgin Mary. But when a procession tried to move the Virgin down the mountain to Manresa, it became too heavy to carry. This was interpreted as a divine signal that the Virgin should be venerated on Montserrat. Chapel of the Santa Cova Cloister of the Santa Cova de Montserrat A chapel was built at the cave between 1696 and 1705, thanks again to the patronage of Gertrudis de Camporrell. Of note is the chapel's vertical orientation atop a steep slope, which serves to emphasize its precipitous location. The chapel is located just beneath the grotto where the original icon was found, and it was built in the form of a Latin cross. At the crossing is a small dome with a lantern to let in light. Since the original icon is located at the larger abbey, the altar has a reproduction of the Virgin. Adjacent to the chapel proper is a small cloister, as well as another structure, of three bays, which includes an ex-voto, sacristy, a room for visiting pilgrims, and room for the monk who lives at the sanctuary and welcomes visitors. Over time, the chapel has been attacked or damaged on numerous occasions. During the Peninsular War (1811‚Äì1812), invading French soldiers severely damaged both the monastery and chapel, though the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano restored the chapel, whose walls were still standing, between 1857‚Äì1859. In 1994, a forest fire destroyed the roofs of all of the chapel's dependencies and cloister, provoking a partial collapse that destroyed much of the interior flooring and furniture. The situation was worsened the following autumn, when heavy rains caused a mudslide and further damaged the chapel and access trail. While repairs were undertaken that winter, a heavy downpour in the autumn of 1995 caused the lantern to collapse into the dome, both of which fell into the chapel. A full restoration was finally finished in march of 1997, when the chapel was reopened to pilgrims.

Early career Juan Ferm√≠n de Huidobro was born in La Asunci√≥n, Isla Margarita, and joined the royal army at an early age. He was of criolla descent. In 1664 he was sent to serve in Trinidad, then in 1668 to New Granada. From there he was appointed to Guayana as lieutenant governor. He returned from Guayana to Margarita, holding various military positions and amassing considerable wealth. Ferm√≠n was appointed maese de campo (military commander) of Margarita in 1677. Governor Juan Mu√±oz Gadea commissioned him to start construction of the Santa Rosa de la Eminencia castle in La Asunci√≥n, on the site of the old San Bernardo fortress. The two men fell out, and work stopped until 1680. Ferm√≠n visited Spain, and on 15 June 1680 was authorized to return to Margarita. That year the Council of the Indies ordered him to build a fort with four bastions and a watchtower in Puerto de la Mar, now Porlamar. Governor of Margarita Mu√±oz Gadea antagonized the local people with his demands, including restrictions on trade, and a group led by Ferm√≠n arranged to suspend him from office. Mu√±oz remained on the island, but Ferm√≠n took over control. Ferm√≠n was appointed Governor of Margarita on 17 May 1681. As governor, Ferm√≠n inspected the defenses of the island and the coast of Cuman√°. He suggested demolishing and relocating the tower of Porlamar, and demolishing the castle and the main church of Cuman√°, as being cheaper than repairing them. He continued to work on the Santa Rosa castle, contributing some of his own money to the effort. On 6 February 1683 Ferm√≠n reported the completion of the Castillo de Santa Rosa. He then asked for a transfer to another location. He was about to complete the tower at Porlamar when he was arrested on 19 September 1683 by Mu√±oz de Gadea, whom the Council of the Indies had restored as governor. Later career Ferm√≠n appealed to the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo. They sent judge Gregorio San Mill√°n to the island, but Mu√±oz forced him to leave. A letter arrived from Spain on 28 March 1684 in which Mu√±oz Gadea was formally confirmed as governor. The Real Audiencia sent judge Fernando Araujo y Rivera to Margarita, who arrived on 5 July 1688 with a body of troops. Araujo arrested Mu√±oz and wanted to restore Ferm√≠n, but was opposed by the people of the island, who had many complaints with his behavior while in office. Araujo now started a trial of Ferm√≠n, who died the next year.

Hooley was also a member of the Lyric Trio, which initially comprised himself, John C. Havens and Estella Mann, and later, after 1901, consisted of Hooley, Harry Macdonough and Grace Spencer. Hooley also recorded as a member of The American Quartet. This was formed in 1909 by Victor Records to provide a new showcase for their star singer, Billy Murray, who took the lead role. The other group members, with Murray and Hooley, were John Bieling and Steve Porter. The group's recordings again became popular, their early successes including \\"Casey Jones\\" (1910), \\"Call Me Up Some Rainy Afternoon\\" (with Ada Jones, 1910), \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" (1911), and \\"Moonlight Bay\\" (1912).Whitburn, Pop Memories 1890-1954, pp.23-24 From 1914, Hooley also recorded as part of the Orpheus Quartet, which included Harry Macdonough, Reinald Werrenrath, and Lambert Murphy; and as a member of the Heidelberg Quintet, which comprised the four members of the American Quartet together with counter-tenor Will Oakland. Hooley made his final recordings in August 1918. He died later that year, \\"suddenly and inexplicably\\". at the age of 57. References External links * * William F.

United Fruit had a sister ship, , built in the same year by Workman, Clark of Belfast, Northern Ireland. Platano had turbo-electric transmission built by British Thomson- Houston of Rugby, Warwickshire. Her oil-fired boilers supplied steam to a turbo generator that fed current to a propulsion motor on her single propeller shaft. Career Platano was owned by a United Fruit subsidiary, Balboa Shipping Co, Inc, which registered her under the Panamanian flag of convenience. In the Second World War the US War Shipping Administration allocated Platano and Musa to the United States Army Transportation Corps. On 18 February 1943 the Director of the Naval Transportation Service approved acquiring the two ships as United States Navy auxiliary ships and on 1 March the Auxiliary Vessels Board endorsed the decision. On 16 March the Naval Transportation Service requested that Platano be assigned to the Navy and on 24 March the Auxiliary Vessels Board confirmed this had been done. Soon the plan was changed, with an older banana boat, SS Ulua being substituted for Musa. On 22 April 1943 the Vice Chief of Naval Operations assigned Platano and Ulua the names and classifications and USS Pictor (AF-27). Ulua was duly acquired, renamed and commissioned into the Navy but Platano was not. The Auxiliary Vessels Board decided on 22 May 1944 to cancel Platanos acquisition, and the cancellation was executed on 26 May. In 1947 United Fruit reflagged Platano from Panama to the Honduran flag of convenience. By 1964 the company had transferred her from Balboa Shipping to another subsidiary, Empressa Hondurena de Vapores. She kept her original name until 1965, when she was renamed El Toro.

He drew national attention during his tenure for cutting expenses in part by privatizing city services, and for refunding residents' property taxes for more than a decade. He was also known as a colorful character with outspoken views on political and social issues, sometimes using a town billboard to express his beliefs. Stranczek was born in Cook County, Illinois, on November 19, 1929. He was the first of eight children born to Polish immigrants Josephine & Kanty Stranczek.Ancestry.com. Cook County, Illinois Birth Index, 1916-1935 Only Polish was spoken at home, and Stranczek began to speak English in first grade. He died in 2015. Baseball career Stranczek worked on his family's farm until graduation from high school in 1949, when he joined the Salina Blue Jays as a pitcher in the Kansas Oklahoma Missouri League. In 1951, he was drafted into the Army. During the Korean War, Stranczek spent 17 months on the Army's baseball team, which was headquartered in Tokyo and toured the Far East. He returned to minor league baseball in , playing with the Burlington Bees before joining the Baton Rouge Red Sticks. In 1955, Stranczek tore the ligament in his right knee, which ended his baseball career. Business and political career After his injury, Stranczek returned to Illinois, and worked for a trucking company before starting his own business, Crest Fuel & Materials, in May 1959. He married Diane Buksa in 1961 and they had two sons, Michael (born 1961) and Robert (born 1964). In 1969, Stranczek ran as a Republican for mayor of the village of Crestwood. It was a post he would hold until his retirement in 2007. He declared his intention to run the town like a business, and through a series of privatizations raised enough business revenue for residential property tax rebates. Those began in 1993 with a total $1 million rebate which increased annually until 2009, when city officials were sued for providing drinking water from a contaminated well. It was found that since the early 1980s the mayor and other officials had opted to tap water from a contaminated source rather than fix a leaky water main. Stranczek retired mid-term in 2007, at age 78. He was succeeded as mayor by his son, Robert Stranczek. Chester lived in Florida until his death in 2015; at the time of the water contamination issue, he was found \\"not competent\\" to testify or face appropriate charges in the poisoning scandal. Water contamination scandal In April 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that for 40 years the city had been drawing drinking water from a well contaminated with toxic chemicals. By secretly drawing water from their contaminated well, Crestwood officials saved $380,000 a year that otherwise would have been spent maintaining the water system, and avoided routine testing that would have alerted authorities to toxic chemicals in the village's drinking water. In April 2013, Crestwood police chief Theresa Neubauer, who was also the city's water commissioner, and certified water operator Frank Scaccia were both found guilty of lying to environmental regulators about water quality. Chester Stranczek had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, and was found not competent to testify about the pollution charges.

Predicate logic can be represented as a vector space of the same type in which the axes represent the predicate letters S and P.Westphal, J (2010). The Application of Vector Theory to Syllogistic Logic. New Perspectives on the Square of Opposition, Bern, Peter Lang. In the vector space for propositional logic the origin represents the false, F, and the infinite periphery represents the true, T, whereas in the space for predicate logic the origin represents \\"nothing\\" and the periphery represents the flight from nothing, or \\"something\\".  Overview  Classic binary logic is represented by a small set of mathematical functions depending on one (monadic) or two (dyadic) variables. In the binary set, the value 1 corresponds to true and the value 0 to false. A two-valued vector logic requires a correspondence between the truth-values true (t) and false (f), and two q-dimensional normalized real- valued column vectors s and n, hence: : t\\\\mapsto s and f\\\\mapsto n (where q \\\\geq 2 is an arbitrary natural number, and \\"normalized\\" means that the length of the vector is 1; usually s and n are orthogonal vectors). This correspondence generates a space of vector truth-values: V2 = {s,n}. The basic logical operations defined using this set of vectors lead to matrix operators. The operations of vector logic are based on the scalar product between q-dimensional column vectors: u^Tv=\\\\langle u,v\\\\rangle: the orthonormality between vectors s and n implies that \\\\langle u,v\\\\rangle=1 if u = v, and \\\\langle u,v\\\\rangle=0 if u e v, where u, v \\\\in \\\\\\\\{s, n\\\\\\\\}. Monadic operators The monadic operators result from the application Mon: V_2 \\\\to V_2, and the associated matrices have q rows and q columns. The two basic monadic operators for this two-valued vector logic are the identity and the negation: * Identity: A logical identity ID(p) is represented by matrix I=ss^T + nn^T, where the juxtapositions are Kronecker products. This matrix operates as follows: Ip = p, p ‚àà V2; due to the orthogonality of s respect to n, we have Is=ss^Ts+nn^Ts=s\\\\langle s,s\\\\rangle+n\\\\langle n,s\\\\rangle=s, and conversely In=n. It is important to note that this vector logic identity matrix is not generally an identity matrix in the sense of matrix algebra. * Negation: A logical negation ¬¨p is represented by matrix N=ns^T + sn^T Consequently, Ns = n and Nn = s. The involutory behavior of the logical negation, namely that ¬¨(¬¨p) equals p, corresponds with the fact that N2 = I.  Dyadic operators  The 16 two-valued dyadic operators correspond to functions of the type Dyad: V_2 \\\\otimes V_2\\\\to V_2; the dyadic matrices have q2 rows and q columns. The matrices that execute these dyadic operations are based on the properties of the Kronecker product. (Multiplying such a dyadic matrix by a q \\\\times q matrix yields a q \\\\times 1 column whose entries are Frobenius inner products of the square matrix by blocks of its same size within the dyadic matrix.) Two properties of this product are essential for the formalism of vector logic: Using these properties, expressions for dyadic logic functions can be obtained: * Conjunction. The conjunction (p‚àßq) is executed by a matrix that acts on two vector truth-values: C(u\\\\otimes v) .This matrix reproduces the features of the classical conjunction truth-table in its formulation: ::C=s(s\\\\otimes s)^T + n(s\\\\otimes n)^T + n(n\\\\otimes s)^T + n(n\\\\otimes n)^T ::and verifies ::C(s\\\\otimes s)=s, and ::C(s\\\\otimes n)=C(n\\\\otimes s)=C(n\\\\otimes n)=n. * Disjunction. The disjunction (p‚à®q) is executed by the matrix ::D=s(s\\\\otimes s)^T+s(s\\\\otimes n)^T+s(n\\\\otimes s)^T+n(n\\\\otimes n)^T, resulting in ::D(s\\\\otimes s)=D(s\\\\otimes n)=D(n\\\\otimes s)=s and ::D(n\\\\otimes n)=n. * Implication. The implication corresponds in classical logic to the expression p ‚Üí q ‚â° ¬¨p ‚à® q. The vector logic version of this equivalence leads to a matrix that represents this implication in vector logic: L=D(N\\\\otimes I). The explicit expression for this implication is: ::L=s(s\\\\otimes s)^T+n(s\\\\otimes n)^T+s(n\\\\otimes s)^T+s(n\\\\otimes n)^T, ::and the properties of classical implication are satisfied: ::L(s\\\\otimes s)=L(n\\\\otimes s)=L(n\\\\otimes n)=s and ::L(s\\\\otimes n)=n. * Equivalence and Exclusive or. In vector logic the equivalence p‚â°q is represented by the following matrix: ::E=s(s\\\\otimes s)^T+n(s\\\\otimes n)^T+n(n\\\\otimes s)^T+s(n\\\\otimes n)^T with ::E(s\\\\otimes s)=E(n\\\\otimes n)=s and ::E(s\\\\otimes n)=E(n\\\\otimes s)=n. ::The Exclusive or is the negation of the equivalence, ¬¨(p‚â°q); it corresponds with the matrix X=NE given by ::X=n(s\\\\otimes s)^T+s(s\\\\otimes n)^T+s(n\\\\otimes s)^T+n(n\\\\otimes n)^T, ::with X(s\\\\otimes s)=X(n\\\\otimes n)=n and ::X(s\\\\otimes n)=X(n\\\\otimes s)=s. * NAND and NOR The matrices S and P correspond to the Sheffer (NAND) and the Peirce (NOR) operations, respectively: ::S=NC ::P=ND  De Morgan's law  In the two-valued logic, the conjunction and the disjunction operations satisfy the De Morgan's law: p‚àßq‚â°¬¨(¬¨p‚à®¬¨q), and its dual: p‚à®q‚â°¬¨(¬¨p‚àß¬¨q)). For the two-valued vector logic this Law is also verified: ::C(u\\\\otimes v)=ND(Nu\\\\otimes Nv), where u and v are two logic vectors. The Kronecker product implies the following factorization: ::C(u\\\\otimes v)=ND(N\\\\otimes N)(u\\\\otimes v). Then it can be proved that in the two‚Äìdimensional vector logic the De Morgan's law is a law involving operators, and not only a law concerning operations:Mizraji, E. (1996) The operators of vector logic. Mathematical Logic Quarterly, 42, 27‚Äì39 ::C=ND(N\\\\otimes N)  Law of contraposition  In the classical propositional calculus, the Law of Contraposition p ‚Üí q ‚â° ¬¨q ‚Üí ¬¨p is proved because the equivalence holds for all the possible combinations of truth-values of p and q.Suppes, P. (1957) Introduction to Logic, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York. Instead, in vector logic, the law of contraposition emerges from a chain of equalities within the rules of matrix algebra and Kronecker products, as shown in what follows: ::L(u\\\\otimes v)=D(N\\\\otimes I)(u\\\\otimes v)=D(Nu\\\\otimes v)=D(Nu\\\\otimes NNv)= :: D(NNv\\\\otimes Nu)=D(N\\\\otimes I)(Nv\\\\otimes Nu)=L(Nv\\\\otimes Nu) This result is based in the fact that D, the disjunction matrix, represents a commutative operation.  Many-valued two-dimensional logic  Many-valued logic was developed by many researchers, particularly by Jan ≈Åukasiewicz and allows extending logical operations to truth-values that include uncertainties.≈Åukasiewicz, J. (1980) Selected Works. L. Borkowski, ed., pp. 153‚Äì178. North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1980 In the case of two-valued vector logic, uncertainties in the truth values can be introduced using vectors with s and n weighted by probabilities. Let f=\\\\epsilon s + \\\\delta n, with \\\\epsilon, \\\\delta \\\\in [0,1], \\\\epsilon + \\\\delta = 1 be this kind of \\"probabilistic\\" vectors. Here, the many-valued character of the logic is introduced a posteriori via the uncertainties introduced in the inputs. Scalar projections of vector outputs The outputs of this many-valued logic can be projected on scalar functions and generate a particular class of probabilistic logic with similarities with the many-valued logic of Reichenbach.Rescher, N. (1969) Many-Valued Logic. McGraw‚ÄìHill, New YorkBlanch√©, R. (1968) Introduction √† la Logique Contemporaine, Armand Colin, ParisKlir, G.J., Yuan, G. (1995) Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic. Prentice‚ÄìHall, New Jersey Given two vectors u=\\\\alpha s + \\\\beta n and v=\\\\alpha's + \\\\beta'n and a dyadic logical matrix G, a scalar probabilistic logic is provided by the projection over vector s: ::Val(\\\\mathrm{scalars}) = s^TG(\\\\mathrm{vectors}) Here are the main results of these projections: ::NOT(\\\\alpha)=s^TNu=1-\\\\alpha ::OR(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=s^TD(u\\\\otimes v)=\\\\alpha + \\\\alpha' - \\\\alpha\\\\alpha' ::AND(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=s^TC(u\\\\otimes v)=\\\\alpha\\\\alpha' ::IMPL(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=s^TL(u\\\\otimes v)=1-\\\\alpha(1-\\\\alpha') ::XOR(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=s^TX(u\\\\otimes v)=\\\\alpha+\\\\alpha'-2\\\\alpha\\\\alpha' The associated negations are: ::NOR(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=1-OR(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha') ::NAND(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=1-AND(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha') ::EQUI(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha')=1-XOR(\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha') If the scalar values belong to the set {0, ¬Ω, 1}, this many-valued scalar logic is for many of the operators almost identical to the 3-valued logic of ≈Åukasiewicz. Also, it has been proved that when the monadic or dyadic operators act over probabilistic vectors belonging to this set, the output is also an element of this set.  History  Early attempts to use linear algebra to represent logic operations can be referred to Peirce and Copilowish,Copilowish, I.M. (1948) Matrix development of the calculus of relations. Journal of Symbolic Logic, 13, 193‚Äì203 particularly in the use of logical matrices to interpret the calculus of relations. The approach has been inspired in neural network models based on the use of high-dimensional matrices and vectors.Kohonen, T. (1977) Associative Memory: A System-Theoretical Approach.

Macmillan, London, 1854; Dover, New York Reedition, 1958 This kind of formalism has been applied to develop a fuzzy logic in terms of complex numbers.Dick, S. (2005) Towards complex fuzzy logic. IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 15,405‚Äì414, 2005 Other matrix and vector approaches to logical calculus have been developed in the framework of quantum physics, computer science and optics.Mittelstaedt, P. (1968) Philosophische Probleme der Modernen Physik, Bibliographisches Institut, MannheimStern, A. (1988) Matrix Logic: Theory and Applications. North-Holland, Amsterdam The Indian biophysicist G.N. Ramachandran developed a formalism using algebraic matrices and vectors to represent many operations of classical Jain Logic known as Syad and Saptbhangi. Indian logic.Jain, M.K. (2011) Logic of evidence-based inference propositions, Current Science, 1663‚Äì1672, 100 It requires independent affirmative evidence for each assertion in a proposition, and does not make the assumption for binary complementation.  Boolean polynomials  George Boole established the development of logical operations as polynomials. For the case of monadic operators (such as identity or negation), the Boolean polynomials look as follows: ::f(x) = f(1)x + f(0)(1-x) The four different monadic operations result from the different binary values for the coefficients. Identity operation requires f(1) = 1 and f(0) = 0, and negation occurs if f(1) = 0 and f(0) = 1\\\\. For the 16 dyadic operators, the Boolean polynomials are of the form: ::f(x,y) = f(1,1)xy + f(1,0)x(1-y) +f(0,1)(1-x)y + f(0,0)(1-x)(1-y) The dyadic operations can be translated to this polynomial format when the coefficients f take the values indicated in the respective truth tables. For instance: the NAND operation requires that: :: f(1,1)=0 and f(1,0)=f(0,1)=f(0,0)=1. These Boolean polynomials can be immediately extended to any number of variables, producing a large potential variety of logical operators. In vector logic, the matrix- vector structure of logical operators is an exact translation to the format of linear algebra of these Boolean polynomials, where the x and 1‚àíx correspond to vectors s and n respectively (the same for y and 1‚àíy). In the example of NAND, f(1,1)=n and f(1,0)=f(0,1)=f(0,0)=s and the matrix version becomes: ::S=n(s\\\\otimes s)^T + s[(s\\\\otimes n)^T+(n\\\\otimes s)^T+(n\\\\otimes n)^T] Extensions * Vector logic can be extended to include many truth values since large dimensional vector spaces allow to create many orthogonal truth values and the corresponding logical matrices. * Logical modalities can be fully represented in this context, with recursive process inspired in neural models.Mizraji, E. (1994) Modalities in vector logic . Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, 35, 272‚Äì283 * Some cognitive problems about logical computations can be analyzed using this formalism, in particular recursive decisions. Any logical expression of classical propositional calculus can be naturally represented by a tree structure. This fact is retained by vector logic, and has been partially used in neural models focused in the investigation of the branched structure of natural languages.Mizraji, E., Lin, J.

It is Bujalski's second black-and-white film, and was shot with analog videocameras. It is more improvisatory than his previous films, with only an eight-page treatment for a script. Bujalski also cast nonprofessional actors who were knowledgeable in computer technology. Plot summary In 1980, an annual gathering of teams of idiosyncratic nerds compete in a nondescript California hotel to see which of their computer programs can best the others at computer chess. A grandmaster (Gerald Peary) presides as master of ceremonies with a videographer and microphone in tow. Clunky, primitive personal computers are carted from room to room. Bad haircuts, dorky shirts, ‚Äúbirth control glasses‚Äù, and other social impedimenta are ubiquitous. Bull sessions on the dystopian possibilities of artificial intelligence are pursued. The Pentagon's interest in the goings-on is intimated. The only female geek (Robin Schwartz) in attendance is repeatedly hailed and ‚Äúwelcomed‚Äù by the MC. Simultaneously at the same hotel, a human potential movement group (the ‚Äúseekers‚Äù) has occasional run-ins with the geeks, generating awkward and humorous moments. A painfully shy young computer programmer (Patrick Riester) attracts the interest of a swinging older couple (Cyndi Williams and Chris Doubek).

Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape is a Proto-Cubist work executed in a highly personal Divisionist style during the height of the Fauve period. The painting is now in the Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection, Spain (Colecci√≥n Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza).Colecci√≥n Carmen Thyssen‚ÄêBornemisza, Jean MetzingerColecci√≥n Carmen Thyssen‚ÄêBornemisza, Baigneuses: Deux nus dans un paysage exotique Description Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat), oil on canvas, 44.8 x 36.8 cm, Korban Art Foundation Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 116 x 88.8 cm (45 3/8 by 35 in), signed Metzinger (lower right). The work‚Äîconsistent in style with other works by Metzinger created circa 1905-1906, such as Femme au Chapeau (Woman with a Hat)‚Äîrepresents two nude women, one seen from the rear and the other from a more frontal position, in a lush, tropical, or subtropical setting. The landscape contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements (trees, bushes, flowers, a lake or river, a mountain range and a partly cloudy sky). Metzinger's use of color in Two Nudes is extremely Fauve; quasi-pure reds, greens, blues and violets, juxtaposed in groups as if randomly. While the two nudes are treated with rather natural colors, the rest of the canvas appears treated with more artificial tints, tones, hues and shades. Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by Henri Matisse, Andr√© Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck or Kees van Dongen, Metzinger's composition is strongly C√©zannian. The vertical format and light colors of the sky and treatment of foreground and background elements create a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of Georges Seurat, or Paul C√©zanne's 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence. However, the brushstrokes and overall appearance are not at all C√©zannian in nature.Joann Moser, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Pre-Cubist Works, 1904-1909, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35 Paul Gauguin, 1892, Tahitiennes sur la plage, oil on canvas, 109.9 √ó 89.5 cm (43.3 √ó 35.2 in), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Henri Rousseau, ca.1905-07, Eve and the Serpent, oil on canvas, 61 x 46 cm, Kunsthalle Hamburg, Germany. Delaunay met Rousseau in 1906, and it is likely that Metzinger met Rousseau around the same time. Henri-Edmond Cross, ca.1906, La fuite des nymphes, oil on canvas, 71 x 92 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay History By 1905 Neo-Impressionism had witnessed a major resurgence, with recent exhibitions by Maximilien Luce (Galerie Druet, March 1904), Paul Signac (Galerie Druet, December 1904), Georges Seurat (Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1905), Henri-Edmond Cross (Galerie Druet, March‚ÄìApril 1905). Metzinger's unique style of Neo-Impressionism resulted from the unification of several influences in addition to that of Seurat and C√©zanne; that of Vincent van Gogh, with his heavy impasto, dense brushstrokes; and‚Äîfollowing posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906‚Äîthat of Paul Gauguin, with its exotic sumptuousness and sensuality. By this time Metzinger had already developed a full-fledged Divisionist facture with large, bold mosaic-like brushwork, beyond that of Cross or Signac.Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo- Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York In statement made circa 1907 regarding his mosaic-like Divisionism‚Äîwhere both size and direction of his cubes of color are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting‚ÄîMetzinger cites parallels with Neo-Impressionism painters and Symbolist literature: > \\"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but > iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a > kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, > variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the > rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions > aroused by nature.\\" (Metzinger, 1907)Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in > Georges Desvalli√®res, La Grande Revue, vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. > Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New > York This statement seems to relate directly to Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape as well as other works of the same period such as La Danse (Bacchante), and Coucher de soleil no. 1 (ca.1906) :\\"Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay.\\" Robert Herbert writes: \\"At the Ind√©pendants in 1905, his paintings were already regarded as in the Neo-Impressionist tradition by contemporary critics, and he apparently continued to paint in large mosaic strokes until some time in 1908. The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment. (In the sky of Coucher de soleil, 1906-1907, Collection Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller is the solar disk which Delaunay was later to make into a personal emblem.)\\" The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque (1906‚Äì1907), \\"is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...\\" (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo)Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo Each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization‚Äîjust as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on‚Äîforming what Metzinger would soon describe as the 'total image'.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23 The bilateral symmetry inherent in Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape is striking (even if only as an approximation). The proto- Cubist geometry is solidly constructed but the equilibrium is unstable or short-lived. Each tile of pigment juxtaposed one next to the other forms a section of the painting, containing between 10 and 50 'tiles'. Each section is dominated by blues, reds, and greens. There is no smooth transition between these section. The painting is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form, already pointing towards Cubism.Alex Mittelmann, 2012, Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism That is not say that Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape belongs to analytic or synthetic Cubism. It does not. The subject is viewed from one point of view, not several. There is no true 'mobile perspective', anymore than in the works of C√©zanne or Seurat. But a departure from nature it was, and a departure from all that had been painted to date it was too; a precursor in style, certainly, one that would resurface in the works of Metzinger and others (Gino Severini, Robert Delaunay, Piet Mondrian) several years later, within the context of Cubism. Cubic and pictorial phraseology Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape signified more that just the incorporation of a radical geometry that would free Metzinger and others from the confines of nature as any artwork executed in Europe to date. This indeed was Neo-Impressionism, Divisionism, albeit in a highly altered form. Beyond the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo- Impressionist color theory, Two Nudes surpassed the teachings of Cross or Signac. It contained \\"iridescences\\", in Metzinger's terms, certain \\"aspects of color still foreign to painting\\". It contained a \\"chromatic versification\\", as if for syllables. The rhythm of its pictorial phraseology translated the diverse emotions aroused by nature. It no longer represented nature as seen, but was a complete byproduct of the human 'sensation.' Art critic Louis Chassevent, writing about the 1906 Salon des Ind√©pendants, used the word \\"cube\\" with reference to Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay, two and a half years before similar references would be made by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize the Proto-Cubist or Cubist works Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque. Recognizing the difference between Metzinger and his contemporaries Louis Chassevent wrote in 1906: :\\"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically.\\" (Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York)Louis Chassevent, 22e Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1906, Quelques petits salons, Paris, 1908, p. 32Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 ‚Äì 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund The following year Metzinger and Delaunay shared an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery (1907). They were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.Art of the 20th Century One and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kahnweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, \\"reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.Alex Danchev, Georges Braques: A Life, Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005 Exhibitions * Le n√©o-impressionnisme, de Seurat √† Paul Klee, catalogue Editions de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux, pp. 360-361, Mus√©e d‚ÄôOrsay, Paris, 15 March ‚Äì 10 July 2005 * Gauguin y el viaje a lo ex√≥tico, catalogue no. 34, p. 146, Museo Thyssen-Bornemiza, Madrid, 9 October 2012 ‚Äì 13 January 2013 * Femina Feminae, Muses and the Collector, From Piazzetta to Delaunay, 10 Museu Carmen Thyssen Andorra, October 2018 ‚Äì 10 September 2019 Provenance * Zwemmer Gallery, London * Private Collection (acquired from the above in 1951) * Acquired in 1982, private collector * Sotheby's London, Impressionist & Modern Art, Day Sale, 4 February 2004, Lot 251 > Lot Notes: The present work is one of a small number of Metzinger > compositions fusing a broad, divisionist facture with a fauve palette.

It is among the earliest architectural testimonies of the early French era, within the framework of the Mandate, under the umbrella of the League of Nations, after Germany was defeated in September 1918. Created in 1921, before the Conference and the treaty of Versailles, the Chamber of Commerce is merely an advisory body. Its mission was to give account of the resources dedicated to development, and also to fix the market prices lists for the farmers. The fifteen members of the Chamber were chosen by the Commissioner of the Republic, and appointed for two years through an arr√™t√©. Among them were two natives: a farmer and a trader, a kind of social innovation within this very context of racial segregation. At the entrance of the edifice, there is a plate that commemorates General Charles de Gaulle's visit to Cameroon in 1940.

Bacchante is a pre- Cubist or Proto-Cubist work executed in a highly personal Divisionist style during the height of the Fauve period. Bacchante was painted in Paris at a time when Metzinger and Robert Delaunay painted portraits of one another, exhibiting together at the Salon d'Automne and the Berthe Weill gallery. Bacchante was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the Salon des Ind√©pendants (No. 3460), along with Coucher de soleil and four other works by Metzinger.Jean Metzinger, Bacchante, Soci√©t√© des artistes ind√©pendants: catalogue de la 23√®me exposition, 1907, no. 3460, p. 225 The painting was purchased by the art historian and collector Wilhelm Uhde and formed part of his collection until it was sequestered by the French government just before World War I. By 30 May 1921 Bacchante was owned by the French painter Andr√© Lhote. The painting appeared at the auction house H√¥tel Drouot where it was presumably purchased by Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, and published in Catalogue of the paintings in the collection of Helene Kr√∂ller-M√ºller.Catalogus van de schilderijen verzameling van Mevrouw H.

Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 34, 35Jean Metzinger, Bacchante, Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum (incorrectly dated circa 1910) Description La danse (Bacchante) is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 73 x 54 cm (28.75 by 21.25 in). The work represents a nude woman in a composition that contains a wide variety of exotic geometrized elements. Metzinger's bold use of color characteristic of his work between 1904 and 1907 is highly noticeable in Bacchante. His brushstrokes are practically all the same size but their directions and colors vary giving rhythm to the overall work. The depth of field is flattened; the foreground blending in with background components. The subject matter is classical‚Äîreminiscent of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (an artist Metzinger greatly admired)‚Äîyet its treatment is everything but classical. Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, 1820-56, La Source (The Spring), oil on canvas, 163 √ó 80 cm (64.2 √ó 31.5 in), Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Ancient Greek terracotta statuette of a dancing maenad, 3rd century BC, from Taranto. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Perso-Roman floor mosaic detail from the palace of Shapur I at Bishapur, Iran This early work in the Divisionist style represents a Bacchante (or maenads). In Greek mythology, maenads were the female followers of Dionysus (Bacchus in the Roman pantheon), the most significant members of the Thiasus. Their name literally translates as \\"raving ones\\". Often the maenads were portrayed as inspired by Dionysus (also known as Bacchus) into a state of ecstatic frenzy, through a combination of dancing and drunken intoxication. In this state they would lose all self-control, begin shouting excitedly, and engage in uncontrolled sexual behavior. Many artists chose this subject over the centuries, probably due to these dramatic characteristics. Her body is depicted nude, seen from the front, with yellow and white highlights and turquoise reflections, the mythological reference serving as pretext for the nude. She is the primary subject of the work and is framed in an exotic setting that accentuates the arching curve of her back. She has a \\"deep voluptuousness,\\" as in the works of Ingres (to use the term of Baudelaire), yet her timeless immobility makes her somehow chaste. The scene is seemingly calm and luxurious simultaneously. Metzinger's early quest for a 'total image' explains the lack of illusory depth, the profuse light, and the refusal to depict a marked difference between the foreground, background and the woman's frame. Metzinger added a conspicuously tropical setting presumably under the influence of Paul Gauguin's Mahana no atua, Day of the Gods (1894) or Henri (lLe Douanier) Rousseau's Le R√™ve (two more painters the artist greatly admired). Bacchante is already typical of Metzinger's style, with its sumptuous textures, sinuous harmony of line (for example the arching trees and foliage), and depiction of the serene attitude and chaste sensuality of the Bacchante's body‚Äîall enlisted in Metzinger's quest for absolute perfection.Alex Mittelmann, Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism, 2011 History Robert Delaunay, 1906, Portrait de Metzinger, oil on canvas, 55 x 43 cm Jean Metzinger, 1906, La danse (Bacchante); Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), Tate Modern, London. Catalogue Collection Uhde, tableaux modernes, aquarelles, dessins, H√¥tel Drouot, 30 May 1921 In 1903 Jean Metzinger arrived in Paris (Montmartre) where he would reside until 1912. At this time he exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants and shortly after at the gallery of Berthe Weill, with Raoul Dufy (1903-1904), with Robert Delaunay (early 1907), with Marie Laurencin (1908) and later with Andr√© Derain, Georges Rouault, Kees van Dongen (1910). At Weill's gallery he met Max Jacob (1907), who introduced him to Pablo Picasso Juan Gris, and Guillaume Krotowsky, who already signed his works Guillaume Apollinaire.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9-23 In 1908 Metzinger participated in a group exhibition at Wilhelm Uhde's gallery on rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs with Georges Braque, Sonia Delaunay, Andr√© Derain, Raoul Dufy, Auguste Herbin, Jules Pascin and Pablo Picasso. In the spring of 1906 Georges Braque exhibited his works for the first time at the Salon des Ind√©pendants. At the exhibition of 1907 six paintings by Braque were exhibited. Five were purchased by Wilhelm Uhde. The sixth work was presumably bought by the art dealer Kahnweiler.Kubisme.info, Salon des Ind√©pendants It was around this time that Braque first met Kahnweiler and was introduced to Picasso by Guillaume Apollinaire. Braques works were still Fauve in nature. It wasn't until the autumn of 1907 at L‚ÄôEstaque that Braque began his transition away from bright hues to more subdued colors, possibly as a result of the memorial exhibition of C√©zanne‚Äôs work at the Salon d'Automne of 1907.Lewis Kachur, Georges Braque, MoMA, Oxford University Press It is unclear exactly when Uhde purchased Bacchante, but it is probable that Metzinger and Uhde first met circa 1906, around the time Delaunay painted a portrait of Uhde in the same style as Metzinger's Bacchante. At the outbreak of World War I, the possessions of many German nationals living in France were sequestered by the French state. Uhde's collection in 1914 included works by Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, Marie Laurencin, Fernand L√©ger, Jean Metzinger (of which Bacchante), Pablo Picasso, Jean Puy and Henri Rousseau. These works were confiscated by the French state and sold seven years later at the auction house H√¥tel Drouot in Paris 30 May 1921.de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de S√©questre de Guerre: Collection Uhde.

For him, there was an emblematic alliance between the Symbolist writers and Neo-Impressionism. Each brushstroke of color was equivalent to a word or 'syllable'. Together the cubes of pigments formed sentences or 'phrases', translating various emotions. This is an important aspect of Metzinger's work of this period, his proto-Cubist work, and an important aspect of Metzinger's entire artistic output (as a painter, writer, poet, and theorist). Prior to the advent of Cubism Metzinger coupled Symbolist/Neo-Impressionist color theory with C√©zannian perspective, beyond the preoccupations of Paul Signac and Henri-Edmond Cross, and beyond too the preoccupations of his immediate entourage.Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo- Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York > \\"I ask of divided brushwork not the objective rendering of light, but > iridescence and certain aspects of color still foreign to painting. I make a > kind of chromatic versification and for syllables I use strokes which, > variable in quantity, cannot differ in dimension without modifying the > rhythm of a pictorial phraseology destined to translate the diverse emotions > aroused by nature.\\" (Metzinger, 1907) \\"What Metzinger meant\\" writes art historian Robert L. Herbert, \\"is that each little tile of pigment has two lives: it exists as a plane where mere size and direction are fundamental to the rhythm of the painting and, secondly, it also has color which can vary independently of size and placement.\\" (Herbert, 1968)Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvalli√®res, La Grande Revue, vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York Furthermore, each individual square of pigment associated with another of similar shape and color to form a group; each grouping of color juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of differing colors; just as syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on. Now, the same concept formerly related to color has been adapted to form. Each individual facet associated with another adjacent shape form a group; each grouping juxtaposed with an adjacent collection of facets connect or become associated with a larger organization‚Äîjust as the association of syllables combine to form sentences, and sentences combine to form paragraphs, and so on‚Äîforming what Metzinger described as the 'total image'. > \\"Artists of the years 1910-1914, including Mondrian and Kandinsky as well as > the Cubists\\", writes Robert Herbert, \\"took support from one of its central > principles: that line and color have the ability to communicate certain > emotions to the observer, independently of natural form.\\" He continues, > \\"Neo-Impressionist color theory had an important heir in the person of > Robert Delaunay. He had been a Neo-Impressionist in the Fauve period, and > knew intimately the writings of Signac and Henry. His famous solar discs of > 1912 and 1913 are descended from the Neo-Impressionists' concentration upon > the decomposition of spectral light.\\" The height of Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay painted portraits of one another in prominent rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's Coucher de soleil no. 1, 1906‚Äì1907 (Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem. The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and so too of Delaunay's Paysage au disque, \\"is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory...\\" (Herbert, 1968) (See, Jean Metzinger, Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo)Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller- M√ºller, Otterlo, Jean Metzinger, Coucher de soleil No. 1 Metzinger, followed closely by Delaunay‚Äîthe two often painting together in 1906 and 1907‚Äîwould develop a new style of Neo-Impressionism incorporating large cubic brushstrokes within highly geometrized compositions that had great significance shortly thereafter within the context of their Cubist works. Both Gino Severini and Piet Mondrian developed a similar mosaic-like Cubo- Divisionist technique between 1909 and 1911. The Futurists later (1911‚Äì1916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of Gino Severini's Parisian works, into their 'dynamic' paintings and sculpture. Cubes At the Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1906 the elected members of the hanging committee included Matisse, Signac and Metzinger. Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Ind√©pendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental Le Bonheur de Vivre (The Joy of Life). Russell T. Clement, Les Fauves: A sourcebook, Greenwood Press, , 1994 The triangular composition is closely related to C√©zanne's Bathers; a series that would soon become a source of inspiration for Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of Le Bonheur de Vivre. Both Robert Delaunay and Jean Metzinger between 1905 and 1907 painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or rectangular planes of color (see also Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape). Writing about the 1906 Salon des Ind√©pendants, the art critic Louis Chassevent set the two apart from other Fauves and Neo-Impressionists. His use of the term \\"cube\\" to describe their work would later be taken up by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: :\\"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been fabricate by machine [...]\\".Louis Chassevent, 22e Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1906, Quelques petits salons, Paris, 1908, p. 32Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 ‚Äì 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund The following year, Metzinger and Delaunay, with whom he shared an exhibition at Berthe Weill's gallery in 1907, were singled out by Louis Vauxcelles as Divisionists who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.Art of the 20th Century One and a half years later, November 1908, Vauxcelles, in his brief review of Georges Braque's exhibition at Kahnweiler's gallery, called Braque a daring man who despises form, \\"reducing everything, places and a figures and houses, to geometric schemas, to cubes.Alex Danchev, Georges Braques: A Life, Arcade Publishing, 15 nov. 2005 References External links * Jean Metzinger: Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism * Culture.gouv.fr, le site du Minist√®re de la culture - base M√©moire * Culture.gouv.fr, Base M√©moire, La M√©diath√®que de l'architecture et du patrimoine, works 1‚Äì50 of 144 * Agence Photographique de la R√©union des mus√©es nationaux et du Grand Palais des Champs-Elys√©es Category:Paintings by Jean Metzinger Category:Proto-Cubist paintings Category:1906 paintings Category:Nude art Category:20th-century portraits Category:Portraits of women Category:Collections of the Kr√∂ller- M√ºller Museum Category:Dance in art Category:Mythology in art ","title":"La danse, Bacchante"},{"id":"39458039","text":"V Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Horse Artillery which existed in the early part of the 20th century. It served with 8th Division on the Western Front in World War I before becoming V Army Brigade, RHA in January 1917. It was reformed after the war but was disbanded in October 1928. The successor unit, 5th Regiment, RHA, was formed in 1939 and still exists as 5th Regiment Royal Artillery. The brigade had an earlier incarnation as E Brigade, RHA, formed from the Horse Artillery Brigade of the Honourable East India Company's Bombay Army in 1862 before being broken up in 1877. History  E Brigade, RHA The Bombay Army of the Honourable East India Company was the last of the Presidency armies to form Horse Artillery, only forming the 1st Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery on 11 November 1811 (still in existence as N Battery, RHA). By the time the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out, the Bombay Horse Artillery had grown to four batteries, organized as the Horse Brigade, Bombay Artillery. Although the Bombay Army was almost completely unaffected by the Rebellion, the British Crown took direct control of India from the East India Company on 1 November 1858 under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858. The Presidency armies transferred to the direct authority of the British Crown and its European units were transferred to the British Army. Henceforth artillery, the mutineers most effective arm, was to be the sole preserve of the British Army (with the exception of certain Mountain Artillery batteries). On 19 February 1862, the Bombay Horse Artillery transferred to the Royal Artillery as its 4th Horse Brigade. On transfer, 4th Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery comprised: *A Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (A/4) - formerly 1st Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Deesa *B Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (B/4) - formerly 2nd Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Kirkee *C Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (C/4) - formerly 3rd Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Nusserabad *D Battery, 4th Horse Brigade (D/4) - formerly 4th Troop, Bombay Horse Artillery at Ahmednagar The 1st Brigade with 10 batteries was much larger than the other four (with four to seven batteries each). A reorganization of the Horse Artillery on 13 April 1864 saw 1st Brigade split as A and B Brigades, 2nd Brigade become C Brigade, 3rd become D Brigade, 4th become E Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery, and 5th become F Brigade. As battery designations were tied to the brigade the battery was assigned to, the batteries were also redesignated, the first of a bewildering series of redesignations. E Horse Brigade, RA now comprised: *A Battery, E Horse Brigade (A/E) - formerly A/4 Battery at Nusserabad *B Battery, E Horse Brigade (B/E) - formerly B/4 Battery at Kirkee *C Battery, E Horse Brigade (C/E) - formerly C/4 Battery at Mhow *D Battery, E Horse Brigade (D/E) - formerly D/4 Battery at Ahmednagar From 1866, the term \\"Royal Horse Artillery\\" appeared in Army List hence the brigade was designated E Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery from about this time. The brigade was broken up on 1 February 1871 and the batteries were transferred to C and D Brigades. It was reformed on 31 March 1875 with five batteries. Another reorganization on 14 April 1877 saw the number of brigades reduced to three (of 10 batteries each) and E Brigade was broken up again. Its batteries were transferred to C Brigade and redesignated again, for example, A/E Battery becoming A Battery, C Brigade. The number of brigades was further reduced to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. V Brigade, RHA =Formation= The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a Lieutenant-Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery). V Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the XI Brigade-Division, RHA with G Battery and O Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as XI Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Ambala. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as V Brigade, RHA. =World War I= At the outbreak of World War I, the brigade was at Ipswich attached to 5th Cavalry Brigade, still commanding G and O Batteries. On 9 October 1914, the newly reformed Z Battery, RHA joined the brigade. It joined 8th Division at Winchester on formation. With 8th Division, it crossed to France on 4 and 5 November 1914 (landing at Le Havre on 6 and 7 November) and served with the division on the Western Front until January 1917. While with the division, it saw action at the battles of Neuve-Chapelle (Moated Grange Attack, 18 December 1914), Neuve Chapelle again (10‚Äì13 March 1915), Aubers Ridge (9 May 1915), Bois-Grenier (25 September 1915), and of the Somme (Battle of Albert on 1 July 1916 and Battle of Le Transloy on 23‚Äì30 October). On 24 November 1914, G Battery was transferred to XV (later IV) Brigade, RHA in 3rd Cavalry Division. O and Z batteries exchanged their 13 pounders for 18 pounders on 8 June 1915. It remained as a two-battery brigade until 8 May 1916 when D(H) Battery joined (designated D(H)/V Battery and armed with four 4.5\\" howitzers). This was formed from one section of 55th (H) Battery and one section of 57th (H) Battery, both of CXXVIII (H) Brigade, RFA. D(H)/V Battery was broken up on 13 January 1917 and the sections returned to their parent batteries. =Army brigade= On 13 January 1917, the brigade left 8th Division and became V Army Brigade, RHA. On the same day, B Battery of CLXXXVIII Brigade, RFA (B/CLXXXVIII Battery) joined and was renamed as A/V Battery. A/V Battery was redesignated as 402nd Battery on 1 June. On 9 April 1918, G and N Batteries, RHA joined from XVII Army Brigade, RHA and 402nd Battery transferred to XIV Brigade, RFA as 141st Battery, RFA. At the Armistice, the brigade was serving as Army Troops with the Fourth Army with G, N, O and Z Batteries RHA (twenty four 18 pounders). =Post-war reorganisation= The brigade took part in the Victory Parade in Paris in July 1919. It returned to Aldershot from Germany in October 1919. At this point, N Battery was then transferred to IX Brigade, RHA and Z Battery to VIII Brigade, RHA; E Battery, RHA joined from III Brigade, RHA. The brigade survived the immediate post-war reductions in the strength of the RHA, serving on as the junior-most brigade, but was broken up at Meerut in October 1928. 5th Regiment, RHA The successor unit, 5th Regiment, RHA, was formed on 25 November 1939 at Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire with G Battery, RHA and K Battery, RHA.

Its primary base of operations was the Damascus area, particularly the city of Douma and the rest of the region of Eastern Ghouta, where Jaysh al-Islam was the largest rebel faction, as was Liwa al-Islam before. The group was part of the Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council until December 2013, but in November 2013 started the Syrian Islamic Front and the next month broke with the SMC and the Free Syrian Army. The group along with Ahrar ash-Sham are among the main rebel groups supported by Saudi Arabia. The group has promoted an Islamic state under Sharia law. In 2015, its then leader claimed in an interview to be seeking for the Syrian government to be replaced by a ‚Äútechnocratic body that represents the diversity of the Syrian people.‚Äù. History Liwa al-Islam Liwa al-Islam was established by Zahran Alloush, the son of Saudi-based religious scholar Abdullah Mohammed Alloush, after Syrian authorities released him from prison in mid-2011, where he had been serving time for his Salafist activism. The group claimed responsibility for carrying out the July 2012 Damascus bombing that killed Defense Minister Dawoud Rajiha, Deputy Defense Minister Asef Shawkat, and Assistant Vice President Hassan Turkmani. Liwa al-Islam was a driving force behind actions in the Damascus region. It cooperated and conducted joint operations with the al-Nusra Front. Merger to form Jaysh al-Islam Jaysh al-Islam fighters during the Siege of Eastern Ghouta On 29 September 2013, 50 rebel factions operating mostly around Damascus announced their merger into a new group called Jaysh al-Islam. Liwa al-Islam was the dominant faction in this merger, and its leader Zahran Alloush was announced as the leader of Jaysh al-Islam. Thirty-eight of the original groups listed as joining the merger were already members of, or affiliated with, Liwa al Islam. In September or earlier, Jaysh' spokesman Islam Alloush had criticized the Syrian National Coalition, stating that the SNC should be led by those who are fighting in Syria rather than leaders in exile, but felt not (yet) inclined to outright break with the SNC. By November 2013, 60 groups had merged into Jaysh al-Islam, and more than 175 rebel groups around Syria expressed a desire to join it. The new group's creation was said to have been negotiated and spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, who believed that al-Nusra Front was gaining too much strength. After the merger, The Guardian reported that Saudi Arabia was preparing to give the group millions of dollars to \\"arm and train\\" its fighters, and use instructors from Pakistan to help train the group. Break from SMC, founding the Syrian Islamic Front  While previously having been part of the Free Syrian Army's Supreme Military Council (SMC), in December 2013 Zahran Alloush announced his departure from that SMC, saying: \\"our affiliation to the Council came when it was coordinating operations against the Assad regime without being dependent on any other party, and when it had signed no pledges as to the makeup of a future state. However, when the FSA had come under the aegis of the Syrian National Coalition (in October 2013) which was committed to a democratic, pluralist state, Alloush ‚Äì who had started the new Syrian Islamic Front of Islamist factions in November 2013 ‚Äì decided he would no longer be part of the Supreme Military Council. In March 2015, Jaysh al-Islam and the Unified Military Command of Eastern Ghouta formed the \\"Military Council of Damascus and its Suburbs\\", under the direct command of Zahran Alloush. On 26 April 2015, they established the Fatah Halab joint operations room along with other major Aleppo based groups. Until late 2015, Jaysh al-Islam at times cooperated with the Al-Nusra Front.Why Jaish Al Islam and Ahrar Al Sham are at the heart of Geneva squabbles. The National. 3 February 2016.  Death of leader Zahran Alloush  Zahran Alloush watches Jaysh al-Islam recruits during a military parade with a captured T-72AV On 25 December 2015, the group's founder Zahran Alloush was killed, along with several other leaders of the group, in a Syrian air strike on the suburbs of Damascus. Abu Hammam Bouwaidani succeeded him as leader. Developments 2016-18  Since the death of Zahran Alloush late 2015, there have been conflicts between Jaysh al-Islam and other members of the Unified Military Command of Eastern Ghouta, along with associated groups such as Al-Nusra Front and its Jaish Al-Fustat operations room. Ahrar Al-Sham have remained neutral. Intra-rebel fighting in Ghouta took place in May 2016, with 300 deaths. On 24 May 2016, leaders of Jaysh al-Islam and al-Rahman Legion met to sign a peace deal to end hostilities. On 25 January 2017, Jaysh al-Islam's Idlib branch joined Ahrar al-Sham. In April 2017 a coalition of the Al-Rahman Legion and Tahrir al-Sham encroached on the area of Eastern Ghouta controlled by Jaysh, which launched a campaign to drive them out, resulting in 95 casualties between 26 April and 1 May. The clashes enabled the Syrian Army to make advances in eastern Damascus. Demonstrators called for an end to the fighting; video footage circulated at the end of April appeared to show Jaysh al-Islam fighters opening fire on demonstrators who called for an end to the rebel infighting. On 12 April 2018, some 13,000 Jaysh al-Islam fighters with their families have evacuated the town of Douma in buses, thus surrendering that town to the Assad government.ARD's Tagesschau ‚Äì the main television news bulletin of Germany, 12 April 2018, 20:00 o'clock, German time. Jaysh fighters and their families have resettled in northern Syria, in the Aleppo countryside, where they operate under the Turkish-backed National Army. Ideology Since 2015, Jaysh al-Islam has called for the Syrian government to be replaced by a technocratic body that represents the diversity of the Syrian people. In 2016, Jaysh al-Islam's ideology was described as a \\"mixture\\" of Salafism, Syrian nationalism, \\"and at least in the past, a significant dose of Sunni sectarianism\\": > Zahran Alloush initially called for the establishment of an Islamic state in > Syria but later renounced his previous positions, expressed support for an > elected government, boasted about the protection his organization offers to > Christians under its rule and even defined the Alawi sect as a victim of the > Assad regime. As an example of the earlier sectarianism, in 2013 or earlier, Alloush in a speech suggested that \\"Sham\\" or Bilad al-Sham (the Levant or specifically Damascus) should be \\"cleansed of the filth\\" of the Shi'ites (whom he called \\"Rafida\\" = rejectionists) and Alawites (whom he called \\"Nusayris\\" or \\"Majous\\" = Zoroastrians, pre-Islamic Persians): \\"And I give you the news, oh unclean Rafida: Just as the Umayyads crushed your heads in the past, the people of Ghouta and Sham will crush them soon, they will make you taste a painful torment in this world, before God makes you taste it in the hereafter\\". In that early period, Alloush denounced democracy and called for an Islamic state to succeed Assad. However, in a May 2015 interview with McClatchy journalists, Alloush used more moderate rhetoric, claiming that Syrians should decide what sort of state they wanted to live under and that Alawites were \\"part of the Syrian people\\" and only those with blood on their hands should be held accountable. His spokesman went on to claim that the sectarian and Islamist rhetoric Alloush had previously made was only intended for internal consumption and to rally his fighters. Notable incidents Reported capture of sophisticated equipment from the Syrian government On 6 October 2012, Liwa al-Islam captured two 9K33 Osa SAM systems in Eastern Ghouta with at least 12 missiles total.Liwa al-Islam and her 9K33 Osa 31 July 2013.

Torture of prisoners In March 2016, Syria Deeply reported: \\"...the leader of Jaish al-Islam, or \\"Army of Islam\\" was killed in December last year in a government air strike. His death, however, did nothing to stop to the group's totalitarian rule in Eastern Ghouta, where residents say torture and imprisonment without trial occur routinely in the name of \\"liberation\\" and Sharia law.\\"\\"Youmna al-Dimashqi (Syria Deeply) Syrians Describe Horrific Torture In Jails Run By Islamist Militants\\". The Huffington Post. 23 March 2016. Filmed execution of ISIL members From approximately January 2014 until July 2015, Jaysh was fiercely fighting ISIL, especially in the Ghouta belt around Damascus. In revenge for ISIL's beheading of Jaysh members and releasing a video recording of the event in June 2015, Jaysh al-Islam's website published a video that showed its fighters executing 18 alleged ISIL militants by shotgun. The video mimics the imagery that ISIL has used for similar filmed executions; however, it reversed the imagery by having the executioners wearing orange prisoner outfits (reminiscent of the jumpsuits victims of ISIS would wear before their untimely executions) and the victims being dressed in black robes. ‚ÄòQariban qariba‚Äô, a song used by ISIS in many of their videos played throughout the execution, albeit the lyrics altered to denounce the group (for example, it says ‚ÄúWith the accusations of apostasy they shed blood‚Äù in reference to ISIS killing innocents and civilians) The video included some English subtitles.The Australian: \\"Syrian rival jihadi group, Jaysh al-Islam, execute ISIS fighters in brutal role reversal video\\" 5 July 2015 Attack on Adra Prison In August and September 2015, Jaysh al-Islam shelled and stormed Adra Prison in north-east Damascus. As of 12 September 2015, it had taken control of two buildings. Use of captives as human shields On 1 November 2015, an opposition media outlet, Shaam News Network, posted a video showing Jaysh al- Islam militants had locked people in cages and spread out 100 cages containing about 7 captives each through Eastern Ghouta, northeast of Damascus, to use them as human shields against Syrian government air raids. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the caged people being used as human shields were captured Alawite military officers and their families who had been kidnapped by Jaysh al-Islam two years ago outside Adra al-Ummaliyah, a government-held neighbourhood in Eastern Ghouta. However, Jaysh al-Islam has not yet claimed responsibility for either of these alleged actions and The New York Times has suggested the possibility that these 'hostages on public display' were a mere show, to sway public opinion against further government and Russian bombardments on Eastern Ghouta. Alleged use of chemical weapons On 7 April 2016, the Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood in Aleppo was shelled with mortars that may have contained chemical agents. On 8 April, a spokesman for the rebel group said that \\"weapons not authorized for use in these types of confrontations\\" had been used against Kurdish militia and civilians in Aleppo. He stated that \\"One of our commanders has unlawfully used a type of weapon that is not included in our list\\". He did not specify what substances were used but, according to Kurdish Red Crescent, the symptoms were consistent with the use of chlorine gas or other agents. Welat Memo, a physician with the Kurdish Red Crescent, said that the people affected are \\"vomiting and having difficulty in breathing.\\" Spokesperson for the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) said that Jaysh al-Islam's \\"statement came after many conclusive evidences and reports of chemical gas being used in shelling Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsoud district\\". He also said that the group has attacked the Kurdish neighborhood of Aleppo with \\"forbidden weapons\\" many times since the war's start.\\"Syrian rebels admit chemical use against Kurds\\". Kurdistan 24. 9 April 2016. Jaysh al-Islam subsequently clarified that it was referring to \\"modified Grad rockets,\\" not chemical weapons.Sam Heller One Kurdish Neighborhood in the Crossfire, Daily Beast, 15 April 2016 Foreign reactions Egypt, Iran, Russia  Stanford University's Mapping Militant Organizations project records that Jaysh al-Islam is not designated as a terrorist organization by any major national government or international body. However, it notes that Russia, Lebanon, and Egypt have supported classifying it as such since the end of 2015. Later, however, JaI was designated \\"moderate opposition\\" in a December 2016 list released by the Russian defence ministry, and participated in the Russian-backed Astana talks.  U.S. (Obama administration)  Jaysh al-Islam's relationship with the United States has remained mixed, though the group has been generally supportive of the U.S. presence in Syria. Former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in a speech in Aspen, Colorado on 28 June 2016, mentioned Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham as \\"subgroups\\" of \\"the terrorists\\" ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusra. US Obama administration officials disapproved this mention and told The Washington Post, who speculated that Kerry's comment may have been accidental, that it was inaccurate and could harm U.S. government efforts to convince the Russian and the Syrian governments not to attack Jaysh al-Islam and Ahrar al-Sham. The Post also reported that \\"Syrian [opposition] groups\\" saw Kerry's comments as an example of how the Obama administration has slowly moved toward the Russian view of Syria, which includes painting all opposition groups as terrorist organizations in order to justify attacking them. The US State Department in July 2016 confirmed that the US administration's policy with regard to Jaysh al-Islam had not changed: Jaysh was and is not a UN-designated terrorist group, is opposed to ISIL, and is not allied to Nusra.Natasha Bertrand State Department officials are 'baffled' by John Kerry's latest comments that have 'muddied the waters' in Syria, Business Insider, 12 July 2016 See also *Douma massacre (2015) *List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War Notes References Bibliography External links * Category:2013 establishments in Syria Category:Anti- government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Russia Category:Organisations designated as terrorist by Iran Category:Salafi groups Category:Sunni Islamist groups ","title":"Jaysh al-Islam"},{"id":"39458222","text":"Bust of Settegast at Humboldt University, Berlin Hermann Gustav Settegast (30 April 1819 in K√∂nigsberg - 11 August 1908 in Berlin) was a German agronomist.

In the 1940s, the music service library was divided into two groups: The \\"5000\\" service with white labels reserved for ASCAP music, and yellow labels, reserved for non-ASCAP licensed music, which included BMI, SESAC, public domain music, and others.Fats Waller on the Air: The Radio Broadcasts and Discography, by Stephen Taylor, Scarecrow Press, pps. 88‚Äì89 (2006)  Lang‚ÄìWorth Feature Programs, Inc.  In 1935, Langlois & Wentworth founded a new division called Lang‚ÄìWorth Feature Programs, Inc., a radio transcription service that was completely copyright-free, except the copyrighting of its own work. Most of the music was in the public domain, but some was purchased, at great expense. The \\"C.S.\\" on its labels indicated that the music was \\"cleared at source by Lang-Worth.\\" The company purported to have the largest collection of public domain music in the world and, for its subscribers, offered a library of over 300 selections with a guarantee of 120 new selections every month. The service filled the gap during the musicians' strike against the major record companies between 1942 and 1944, although Lang-Worth continued to do business for a number of years after WWII. The company was headquartered in New York at Steinway Hall and had a printing plant at 55-20 Grand Avenue, Maspeth, Queens, New York.Flames Damage Printing Plant, Long Island Star Journal, October 20, 1951, pg. 5, col 1 (bottom) Lang- Worth artists included the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Woody Herman, Elton Britt, Henry Jerome, and Patti Page.

While Technovore made its animated debut in the TV series Iron Man: Armored Adventures, it has since made limited media appearances. Publication history Technovore first appears in Iron Man #294 and was created by Len Kaminski and Kevin Hopgood. Fictional character biography Technovore is a technological parasite created by a scientist that kills everyone inside the Stark Enterprises orbital space station. Iron Man investigates and confronts the nanotech monstrosity. As Iron Man heads to the station, a being called the \\"Goddess\\" takes him aside to offer him a place among her converts; Iron Man refuses and she promises punishment. Entering the station, Iron Man finds that the space crew members are now techno-organic creatures and they attempt to consume him as part of their quest for completion. Iron Man renovates his armor arsenal using the station stores, but after destroying the creatures they reform themselves into a single being calling itself the Technovore.Iron Man 294. Marvel Comics. Iron Man battles the Technovore, but it can reshape itself from injury almost instantly. The Technovore causes the station's center of gravity to change, tearing the structure apart. Iron Man battles the creature in space and prepares his auto-destruct sequence but has to remain linked via telepresence at the last moment to prevent the Technovore from hacking into his computer and halting the countdown. Unfortunately, the Technovore overcomes Tony's controls. But at the explosion's instant, the Goddess separates Tony's consciousness from his body to save him from the neural feedback. She offers Tony another chance to serve her, but when he still refuses she returns him to his body.Iron Man #295. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Technovore's body is made entirely of nanobots. It can disassemble itself into a stream of nanites, enabling it to fit into and travel through extremely small spaces. Each nanite carries a copy of the entire viral personality, and it is implied that the whole entity can reconstruct itself from a single unit. Technovore can absorb technology into itself, adding the abilities of consumed technology into its physical being. In addition, Technovore's inherent resilience is augmented by an ability to adapt to weapons; over time, it will become immune to a given weapon if struck by it enough times. In other media Television * Technovore appears in Iron Man: Armored Adventures, voiced by Tabitha St. Germain. Introduced in the episode \\"Seeing Red\\", it is a virus designed by Tony Stark to consume Project Pegasus's data on the Iron Man and Crimson Dynamo armors and to stop Obadiah Stane from getting both. The virus was meant to burn itself out, but it became sentient when it uploaded itself into Project Pegasus's nanobot project. In its self-titled episode, the Technovore virus molds the nanotechnology into a body and ran loose in Project Pegasus' facility, assimilating all forms of technology it could find. James Rhodes traveled to the facility to investigate a disturbance, but encounters Technovore, who used Rhodes' earpiece to call its creator so it could consume the Iron Man armor. Project Pegasus' lead scientist, Anton Harchov, escapes just before Iron Man arrives, activates his armor's self-destruct function, and seemingly destroys Technovore. Unbeknownst to everyone however, pieces of the virus' nanotech landed on Anton's coat. * Technovore appears in The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, voiced by Dwight Schultz. Introduced in the episode \\"Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\\", it is seen as an inmate of the Vault. After escaping off-screen in \\"The Breakout (Pt. 1)\\", Technovore returns in \\"Alone Against A.I.M.\\", after it gets captured by A.I.M. agents and reprogrammed so their Scientist Supreme could take revenge on Tony Stark. Technovore is released in Stark Industries and fights Tony, Maria Hill, and War Machine before Tony tricks the virus into consume the Arc Reactor's vast energy, destroying it in the process. * Technovore appears in the Spider-Man episode \\"Web of Venom\\", after Grady Scraps accidentally releases it from Horizon University's project graveyard and assimilates various forms of technology Spider-Man used a synthetic symbiote copy to defeat it. Film * Technovore appears in the anime film Iron Man: Rise of Technovore, voiced by Miyu Irino in the Japanese version and by Eric Bauza in the English dub. This version is a biotechnological nanite virus created by Zeke Stane, which serves as armor through a combination of biotechnology, mechatronics, and a biomechanical organism, every cell of which is created via molecular assembler. Initially linked directly to Zeke's nervous system so he could control it with his thoughts, Technovore later gained sentience and mutated its host's body to destroy everything that stands in its way, using the \\"Howard\\" satellite as its core. When Pepper Potts destroys the satellite, Iron Man and War Machine defeat Technovore before freeing a comatose Zeke and transferring him into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s custody.

Period of apprenticeship Samson Flexor was born in Soroca in a wealthy Jewish family. His father, Modest Flexor, the son of merchant agricultural colony in Zguritsa (now Soroca District of Moldova) was known throughout the province as an agronomist, a landowner and one of the richest men. His mother Marie-Georgette (n√©e Kleiner) was born in France. Samson was educated at a private school in Soroca, then in the Odessa Art School and school in Bucharest, where she moved the whole family. In 1922-1924 he studied at the Belgian Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Academie Royale des Beaux-Arts) in Brussels, and since 1924 in the Paris National School of Fine Arts (√âcole Nationale des Beaux-Arts) Lucien Simon (Lucien Simon, 1861-1945), and also attended lectures on art history at the Sorbonne University. In 1926 he studied fresco technique in private Academie Ranson. In the late 1920s, his parents also settled in Paris, and in 1929 the family received French citizenship. Paris period and conversion to Roman Catholicism Flexor began to paint with Sorokskaya landscapes, to the 1920s, almost entirely focused on portretistike, first performed in a realistic manner. Over the years, portrait work appear more pronounced expressionist features. The first solo exhibition of works by Flexor held 22 April 1927 in Brussels in the gallery Campagne Premiere, followed by a part in group exhibitions in Paris, during the 1930s, he regularly exhibited at the Salon des Surind√©pendants. In 1933 his wife died in Flexor's childbirth Tatiana Yablokov. This tragedy led to a creative and existential crisis: in the same year Flexor adopted Roman Catholicism and some time to painting. When he began to paint again, his works have appeared distinctly religious motives. The relationship of the artist with his family at this time dramatically cooled and financial situation deteriorated. In 1939 he married again with Magda Mezhicher, and in the same year his first son was born and he restored relations with the family. In the next year his father bought for him a house in Normandy, where, after a brief participation in the French Resistance movement, the artist has retired with his family and spent the entire World War II years. Brazilian period After the war Flexor did not remain in France. In 1946 he first visited Brazil, and in the spring of 1948 he left France for good and settled in S√£o Paulo. Since moving to Brazil realism completely disappeared from the works of the artist, and all his further work was abstract. In 1951 Flexor opened the first abstractionist studio in Brazil called Atelier-Abstra√ß√£o, where the exhibited works are united around him a group of Brazilian contemporary abstract painters Jacques Douchez, Norberto Nicola, Leopoldo Raimo, Alberto Teixeira, Wega Nery, p. 1912), An√©sia Pacheco e Chaves, Charlotta Adlerov√°, Ernestina Karman, Iracema Arditi and Gisela Eichbaum. In 1961 Flexor opened the second abstractionist studio. The only exception to the whole abstractionist art in Brazil during the frescoes were made by him in 1948 for the church of Nossa Senhora de F√°tima and in 1958-1960 for the Church of Nossa Senhora do Perp√©tuo Socorro in S√£o Paulo. In the last years of his life and during the 1970s the work of Samson Flexor regularly exhibited in Brazil in recent years has increased interest in his work and abroad. A comprehensive exhibition of one hundred paintings by the artist to the centennial of his birth, \\"One Hundred Years / one hundred works\\" ( 100 de ani/100 de opere ) was held from 11 to 28 September 2007 at his home in the National Art Museum of Moldova in Chi»ôinƒÉu, where in October moved in Bucharest and beyond - repeating the career of the artist - in Brussels, London, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in Brazil - Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Po√ßos de Caldas and S√£o Paulo.

A native of Runan (Ê±ùÂçó, present-day Wuchang District, Hubei province), Mei Ze served as governor of Yuzhang Commandery (Ë±´Á´†, present-day Nanchang, Jiangxi province). After the establishment of the Eastern Jin, he presented a purported copy of Kong Anguo's lost compilation of the Old Text Shangshu (Book of Documents) to the emperor, which became officially recognized as a Confucian classic for over a millennium. However, Mei Ze's version of the Shangshu has been proven a forgery. Background The Shangshu, a collection of documents written in the Zhou Dynasty, is one of the Five Classics of Confucianism. Most copies of the book were destroyed in 213 BC, when the First Emperor of Qin ordered a large- scale burning of books. The scholar Fu Sheng hid a copy in the wall and later recovered 29 chapters of it, which is known as the \\"New Text\\" Shangshu. During the early Western Han Dynasty, another copy was accidentally discovered hidden in the walls of the mansion of Confucius, which contained 16 more chapters than Fu Sheng's version. Scholar Kong Anguo compiled and wrote a commentary of the document, and presented it to the emperor. This version is called the \\"Old Text\\" Shangshu, which was however lost during the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 AD). \\"Rediscovery\\" of the Old Text Shangshu After the Yongjia Disturbance ended the Western Jin Dynasty in 311 AD, the Jin court fled southeast to Jiankang. Emperor Yuan, the first emperor of Eastern Jin, asked the public to submit books to the court in order to replenish the imperial library which had been destroyed in the war. Mei Ze presented a \\"rediscovered\\" copy of Kong Anguo's Old Text Shangshu to the emperor, along with a preface purportedly written by Kong. Explaining the discovery, Mei Ze claimed that he acquired the documents from a certain Zang Cao (ËáßÊõπ), who had previously obtained them from Liang Liu (Ê¢ÅÊü≥), a cousin of the famous physician-scholar Huangfu Mi, and that he had salvaged the text from destruction in the warfare that ended the Western Jin. Zang Cao and Liang Liu had both been dead by the time Mei Ze presented the scripture to the emperor. The Jin court accepted Mei's version as authentic, and it became widely disseminated throughout the empire. Mei Ze's version of the Shangshu includes Fu Sheng's New Text, which was redivided into 33 chapters, along with 25 extra chapters purportedly from Kong Anguo's lost Old Text, for a total of 58 chapters. Legacy Mei Ze's Old Text Shangshu became highly influential. In the seventh century, during the early Tang dynasty, scholar Kong Yingda oversaw the imperial Correct Meanings of the Five Classics (‰∫îÁ∂ìÊ≠£Áæ©) project, and Mei Ze's Old Text became the official version of the Confucian classic. The Shangshu Zhengyi, likely authored by Kong, provided the official interpretation of the text. Although many scholars had questioned the authenticity of Mei's version over the centuries, it maintained its official status and was the most influential version of the Shangshu for more than 1,000 years until the Qing Dynasty, when the 17th- century scholar Yan Ruoqu devoted much of his lifetime to the study of the Shangshu and conclusively proved that Mei Ze's version was a forgery. Analyses of the recently discovered Tsinghua Bamboo Slips have further bolstered Yan's now widely accepted conclusion.

(\\"PageRank\\" is an algorithm used in Google Search for ranking websites in their results, but it has been adopted for other purposes also. According to Google, PageRank works by \\"counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is,\\" the underlying assumption being that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites.)  Application in analyzing protein networks  The relative importance-measuring property of the PageRank link analysis algorithm could be used to identify new possible drug targets in proteins.Iv√°n G, Grolmusz V (2011). \\"When the Web meets the cell: using personalized PageRank for analyzing protein interaction networks\\". Bioinformatics 27 (3): 405‚Äì7. A PageRank-based algorithm could identify important protein targets in the pathogen organism better than a method considering only the number of incoming edges (in-degree) of a node in the metabolic network. The reason for this is that some already known, important protein targets do not have a high degree (are not hubs) and also, perturbing some hubs could result in unwanted physiological effects.Russell RB, Aloy P (2008). \\"Targeting and tinkering with interaction networks\\". Nat Chem Biol 4: 666‚Äì673.  Description  The clinical use of most antibiotics result in a mutation of the pathogen organism leading to their resistance against the drug. Therefore, development of new drugs is always needed. A potential first step in developing new drugs against currently threatening diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) is to find new drug targets in the causative agent of the disease, i.e. the pathogen microorganism, let it be either a bacterium, or a protozoan parasite. After finding the target protein in the bacterium (or protozoan parasite), one could design small molecular drug compounds that bind to the protein and inhibit it.

By using the available metabolic networks, it is possible to find important nodes with link analysis algorithms, like PageRank. In a recently published paper,B√°nky D, Iv√°n G, Grolmusz V (2013). \\"Equal Opportunity for Low-Degree Network Nodes: A PageRank-Based Method for Protein Target Identification in Metabolic Graphs\\". PLoS ONE 8(1): e54204. biochemical reactions are treated as nodes of the metabolic network. In this directed network, reaction A has a directed edge towards reaction B if the product of the former enters the latter reaction as a substrate or co-factor. To select important nodes that could serve as drug targets, we might think of selecting high in-degree nodes (hubs; nodes with many incoming edges). It was shown however[2], that targeting hub proteins with many vital functions may unintentionally harm the living cell as well. A PageRank-based scoring method could detect important nodes that are not hubs and therefore might be better drug targets. The PageRank of a node A is the stationary limit probability distribution that the random walker is at node A. In its original application, the personalization vector w captured the personal interest of a web-surfer: interesting websites to a surfer appeared with a higher probability in the distribution given in vector w. In this metabolic network, w is personalized to proteins; w is larger for those proteins that appear in higher concentrations in the proteomics analysis of certain diseases. This personalized PageRank may identify other related proteins to the disease. However, by using only the personalized PageRank to identify important nodes, hubs still get a high score on average.Fortunato S, Boguna M, Flammini A, Menczer F (2008). \\"Approximating pagerank from in- degree\\". Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4936: 59‚Äì71. To find non-hub important nodes instead, we should consider scoring the nodes by their \\"relativized personalized PageRank\\"; i.e. their personalized PageRank scores over the number of edges pointing towards them (over their in-degree): The relativized personalized PageRank (rPPR(v)) for a node v is given by: rPPR(v)=\\\\frac{PPageRank(v)}{d_v} where PpageRank(v) is the personalized PageRank score of node v, and d_(v) is its in-degree. It was shown, that by using this method, numerous already validated drug targets can be found (e.g. in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis), therefore, new, currently unknown targets might be detected as well.

Biography  Born into a family of teachers, Encho Keryazov was born in 1973 in Elhovo, Bulgaria. At the age of 6 he was a rather frail boy, so his mother had the idea of starting to train him and he began acrobatic training at a local sports club. At first he did not meet the physical prerequisites, however, his upcoming ambition and obvious talent finally convinced his trainers he was capable. At the age of 14 Keryazov was Youth Champion in Sport Acrobatics, the following year he was a member of the Bulgarian national team and national champion of sports acrobatics. As a 16-year-old he had his first real contact with a circus and joined the jockey cavalry troupe \\"Romanovi\\" and he traveled throughout Europe for seven years. In the following year Keryazov developed an independent equilibristics act. With the presentation of a very special handstand acrobatic act he has won prizes in England, the Netherlands, France and Germany. One of the temporary highlights of his career was winning the Audience Award and the \\"Silver Clown\\" at the International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo in 2007. In 2011 he received the highest award of the Bulgarian Artists Association, the \\"IKAR\\" and became an honorary citizen of his home town of Yambol. In 2011 he founded the Foundation Encho Keryazov, with the support of other Bulgarian celebrities, which promotes talented young people engaged in science, arts and sports, giving creative and financial support. The Foundation has gained national and international attention, so that the annual awards, held since 2012 in Keryazov's hometown Yambol, where the awards are given to children and young people, are in the presence of the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Kristian Vigenin, the Minister of Culture Weschdi Raschidow and ambassadors from Germany and the Netherlands. During the charity gala in January 2015 he gathered high-level international circus artists in Yambol, including the clown David Larible. The preliminary peak of his social commitment is a benefit-gala in Sofia in February 2016, which he organizes with his friend and supporter of the foundation, Yordan Yovchev (Olympic gold medalist and President of the Bulgarian Sports Federation) to collect more financial resources for the Foundation. Encho Keryazov and Arnold Schwarzenegger As part of a special edition Keryazov appeared alongside other artists Circus Roncalli on an Austrian stamp.

The groundwater basin provides a water supply to 19 municipal water agencies and special districts that serve more than 2.4 million Orange County residents. The Orange County Water District's service area covers approximately 350 square miles and the District owns approximately 1,600 acres in and near the Santa Ana River, which it uses to capture water flows for groundwater recharge. Additionally, the Orange County Water District owns approximately 2,150 acres of land above the Prado Dam in the Prado Reservoir and uses that land for water conservation, water storage and water quality improvements. The water district's administrative offices and the Groundwater Replenishment System facilities are located in Fountain Valley, while it also operates various groundwater recharge facilities located in Anaheim and Orange.  History  The Orange County Water District was formed by an act of the California State Legislature in 1933. The District Act was signed on June 14 of that year by Governor James Rolph, Jr. The Orange County Water District was designated as an Orange County Historical Civil Engineering Landmark in 2006.  Facilities   Groundwater Replenishment System  The Groundwater Replenishment System takes highly treated wastewater from the Orange County Sanitation District and purifies it using microfiltration, reverse osmosis and ultraviolet light with hydrogen peroxide. This produces high-quality water that exceeds state and federal drinking water standards. The GWRS has been operational since January 2008 and initially produced up to 70 million gallons of water daily. After the completion of an upgrade in 2015, the plant now produces 100 million gallons per day with an expansion to provide up to 130 million approved on September 21, 2016. The Orange County Water and Sanitation Districts were awarded the Stockholm Industry Water Award in 2008 for pioneering work to develop the Groundwater Replenishment System, the world‚Äôs largest water purification plant for groundwater recharge.  Groundwater recharge facilities  The Orange County Water District operates groundwater recharge facilities in the Cities of Anaheim and Orange. A 30-year lease agreement was approved in January 2013 to allow the district to construct an injection water well and well facilities at the Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center.Board of Directors (January 2, 2013) \\"Minutes of Meeting\\" Orange County Water District = Facilities in Anaheim = * Anaheim Lake * Burris Basin *Crescent Basin * Conrock Basin * Five Coves Basin *Gilbert Basin * Huckleberry Basin * Kraemer Basin * La Jolla Basin * Lincoln Basin * Miller Basin * Mills Pond * Miraloma Basin * Olive Basin * Placentia Basin *Raymond Basin * Warner Basin = Facilities in Orange = * Fletcher Basin * Riverview Basin * Santiago Basins (Diamond and Bond Pits)  Other facilities  * Prado wetlands * Seawater barrier  Member agencies and cities  There are 19 city water departments and water districts that are member agencies of the Orange County Water Dsitrict and pump groundwater from the basin. # City of Anaheim # City of Buena Park # East Orange County Water District # City of Fountain Valley # City of Fullerton # City of Garden Grove # Golden State Water Company # City of Huntington Beach # Irvine Ranch Water District # City of La Palma # Mesa Water District # City of Newport Beach Water Department # City of Orange # City of Santa Ana Municipal Services # City of Seal Beach # Serrano Water District # City of Tustin # City of Westminster # Yorba Linda Water District  Governance  The Orange County Water District is governed by a ten-member board of directors.
