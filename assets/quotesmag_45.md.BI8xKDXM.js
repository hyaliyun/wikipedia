Written by co- creator Brad Falchuk and directed by Paris Barclay, it aired on Fox in the United States on February 7, 2013. Paris Barclay was nominated at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode. Plot Glee club director Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is convinced by guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to create a \\"diva-off\\" assignment to prepare New Directions for Regionals. Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), Kitty Wilde (Becca Tobin), Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), Wade \\"Unique\\" Adams (Alex Newell) and Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist), then perform \\"Diva\\" in preparation for the assignment. Meanwhile, in New York City, Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is becoming increasingly irritated by Rachel Berry's (Lea Michele) arrogance after winning the Winter Showcase and challenges her to a \\"diva-off\\". They both perform \\"Bring Him Home\\", and Kurt is declared the winner, which shakes Rachel's confidence in herself until Kurt reassures her of her talent and encourages her to audition for an upcoming production of Funny Girl. In Lima, following Blaine's performance of \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", Finn reveals that Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) has agreed to perform for New Directions with her fellow cheerleaders from the University of Louisville and Santana leads a rendition of \\"Nutbush City Limits\\". She reveals that she has discovered about Brittany's relationship with Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) through Tina, and attempts to undermine their relationship. They duel with \\"Make No Mistake (She's Mine)\\", while Brittany secretly watches. Meanwhile, Tina struggles with her romantic feelings for Blaine, and, after failing to declare herself to him, she expresses her feelings through a performance of \\"Hung Up\\", which convinces Finn and Emma to declare her winner of the diva-off, and Blaine to apologize for taking her for granted by asking her to be his date to Will Schuester and Emma's upcoming wedding. Throughout this, Finn, still reeling from having discovered that Rachel has moved in with her boyfriend Brody Weston (Dean Geyer), helps Emma prepare for the wedding, and, when she has a breakdown over a series of trivial matters, Finn attempts to calm her down by kissing her, but quickly realizes it was a mistake and leaves a shocked Emma behind. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) reveals that she knows Santana has dropped out of college and offers her a job as interim coach for the Cheerios, but, after a talk with Brittany, encouraging her to follow her dreams, Santana sings \\"Girl on Fire\\" to empower herself before relocating to NYC and moving in with Rachel and Kurt, much to their surprise.

Critical response Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review to the episode, especially with the end scene with Finn and Emma, saying \\"Did anyone see that coming? We‚Äôll have to wait until next week for the fall out, because as soon as he kissed her, he freaked out and immediately left her office. I‚Äôm no psychic, but I don‚Äôt think this is going to have fans cheering quite as much as Nick and Jess‚Äô big kiss on New Girl.\\"He then talked positively about the performance of \\"Bring Him Home\\" and \\"Diva\\", calling the first song of the two \\"\\"Defying Gravity Part 2\\" for out NYADA kids.\\" The second song was \\"a ton of fun. Loved the idea of turning an auditorium into a runway, did not love Blaine‚Äôs feathered top. Unique taking lead vocals on this was a great choice.\\" L'Oreal Thompson of The Baltimore Sun commented on Tina's role in the episode, saying \\"I really do feel bad for her. It's no fun feeling unappreciated and being on the spurned side of unrequited love.\\" Thompson then gave a mixed review to Santana's end song, saying \\"I know it's a good message and all, but I just feel like it should be in the Gabby Douglas Lifetime movie or something.\\" Paris Barclay was nominated at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for this episode.

Consisting of two vessels, these submarines were highly modified versions of Holland-class vessels designed in the United States. Background During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese government had purchased five modified Holland-class submarines from the Electric Boat Company‚Äôs Fore River Shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts.Jentschura p. 160 These vessels, known as the Type 1-class were delivered to Japan in knock-down form, and re-assembled at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. However, simultaneously, the Japanese government had obtained copies of the blueprints for the Holland- class submarines, and had assigned Kawasaki Dockyards in Kobe the task of building similar vessels in Japan. Construction and operational history Kawasaki built two boats (Hulls No. 6 and 7), with the help of two American engineers, Chase and Herbert, who had been assistants to John Philip Holland. The Kawasaki-built submarines displaced 63 or 95 tons when submerged, and measured 73 or 84 feet in overall length, respectively, and were thus longer and displaced less than the original five imported Holland-type submarines which had arrived that same year. However, they had almost double the engine power, which gave extra speed and reduced fuel consumption. On the other hand, both vessels could launch only one 18\\" torpedo, and each was manned by 14 sailors, whereas the imported Holland-type submarines could fire two torpedoes and could be operated by 13 sailors. The Kaigun Holland #6 was launched at Kobe on 28 September 1905 and was completed six months later at Kure as the first submarine built in Japan. It sank during a training dive in Hiroshima Bay on 15 April 1910. Although the water was only 58 feet deep, there were no provisions for the crew to escape while submerged. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Tsutomu Sakuma, patiently wrote a description of his sailor's efforts to bring the boat back to the surface as their oxygen supply ran out. All of the sailors were later found dead at their duty stations when this submarine was raised the following day. The sailors were regarded as heroes for their calm performance of their duties until death,Baldwin pp.92-110 and the submarine was preserved as a memorial in Kure until the end of World War II.

The story of the game follows a young princess who is training to become queen after the death of her mother. The objective of the game is to keep the princess alive for 40 weeks until she turns 15 and is crowned. The game was released on June 2, 2012 for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. The game uses anime-style graphics and is written in English. Plot The queen of Nova has recently died, and her daughter, the 14-year-old princess Elodie, must leave her schooling to ready herself to become the next queen. Her coronation is set for 40 weeks from the present‚Äîher 15th birthday. Many people in the kingdom are trying to take advantage of the recent monarch's death and attempt to kill Elodie. Gameplay Political intrigue plays a key role in the game. The player reads through the story and schedules the protagonist's weekly lessons, in topics such as economy, foreign affairs, logistics, expression, military matters, self-defense, intrigues, doublespeak and magic. Based on those activities, Elodie increases her proficiency in various statistics. Additionally, during the weekend Elodie has free run of the castle and can choose an activity that alters her mood. She has four emotional axes, and her position on each determines her proficiency at learning certain topics: for instance, being \\"Willful\\" will help her master military and intrigue skills easier, but it will also hamper learning civil skills like royal demeanor. Once all three sub skills of a particular skill are raised to a certain point (around 30 each), Elodie gains an outfit that boosts that specific skill. Learning some skills unlocks additional weekend actions: for example, learning \\"Dance\\" allows her to attend balls, while \\"Reflexes\\" gives her the ability to play tennis. As the weeks progress, Elodie is presented with various social and political opportunities. When they occur, the game performs checks against Elodie's current skills and chooses an outcome, sometimes without giving the player the option of interceding. For instance, one of the first skill checks (a snake attack) requires 10 points in the \\"Composure\\" skill. Should Elodie be successful, she keeps her cool, allowing a guard to kill the snake; should she fail, her cousin gets bitten, an event whose consequences can be felt in one specific route the game can take. Most of the checks can be failed without serious consequence, but some can close off entire branches of the story. Very often however, passing or failing a skill check is a matter of life or death for Elodie: if her skills aren't up to par, she dies (in one of various possible ways). Because of the branching decision trees, the game features multiple endings, varying according to whom Elodie marries, how she dealt with neighboring nations, her ability with magic, the fate of her father Joslyn, and‚Äîof course‚Äîwhether she survived to her coronation at all. Development The game was developed by Hanako Games, which also created Cute Knight, Cute Knight Kingdom, and Magical Diary, all of which are designed for girls but appeal to a wider audience. Long Live The Queen has darker themes than the previous titles. A free update for the game was released on January 26, 2015 adding new characters, story elements and endings and other content to the game. Reception Technology Tell gave a score of 90/100 to the game, writing: \\"It‚Äôs really an unusual adventure and I admire Hanako Games and Spiky Caterpillar for stepping a little outside their comfort zone to release a darker game that requires players to think smart and manage emotions to keep a character alive.\\" IndieGames was positively reviewed, writing: \\"Long story short, Long Live The Queen is a solid title.\\" References External links * Official website * Category:2012 video games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games Category:Ren'Py games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Yuri (genre) video games Category:Western visual novels ","title":"Long Live the Queen (video game)"},{"id":"38000250","text":"Skiklubben Skuld was a Norwegian skiing club, based in Oslo.

Though some texts refer to Mark as \\"Mark Codman\\", he was probably not referred to as such during his life as giving a slave the surname of his master was not commonly done with New England slaves.Catherine Adams and Elizabeth Pleck (2010), \\"Love of Freedom:\\", p. 7. ,New York The contemporary documents from the investigation and trial only use Mark for his name. Mark was a slave to Codman for a few years before his execution. He was accused of burning down a building about 6 years before his death to try to gain freedom. Mark could read, and was accused of reading the Bible to find a way to kill his master without committing a sin. He struck upon poisoning because it did not involve the shedding of blood. According to historical documents from the investigation and judgement, Mark obtained arsenic from a doctor on the pretense it was to kill pigs, but furnished it to his sister who administered it to Codman. Several other slaves were also implicated in the plot. In 1755, Mark was convicted of assisting in the successful poisoning of his master, John Codman. As punishment, Mark was hanged, tarred, and his body displayed in an iron gibbet for several years after his death at a well-known spot (at the time) in present-day Somerville, Massachusetts.George Francis Dow, John Henry Edmonds (1996). The Pirates of the New England Coast, 1630-1730, p. 113. Dover Publications, New York. . Mark's sister Phillis was tried for the actual act of poisoning; she was convicted and burned alive. Mark's publicly displayed body was a local landmark. In 1775, twenty years after Mark's execution, Paul Revere came to the same spot in his famous ride. Revere's 1798 written account included \\"nearly opposite where Mark was hung in chains, I saw two men on Horse back, under a Tree. When I got near them, I discovered they were British officers\\". Using the location of the display of Mark's body as a reference point, Revere was confident that even forty-three years after Mark's execution, Revere's reader of his 1798 account of his 1775 ride would understand where he spotted the British officers.

The block stone building has a blue plaque on the front, marking its historical significance. It became a Grade II listed building on 12 May 1963. The inn is dated to the medieval period, around the 12th century. It was once probably a three-unit, lateral chimney, hall-house, later converted into a storeyed house. It has undergone much alteration over the years, and little remains of the original except the fireplaces, one of which is in poor condition. The fireplace lintels of carved stone are notable. The hall fireplace has two shields, one bearing a reversed lion rampant and the other a trefoil. The hall contains heavy ceiling beams, dated to the late 16th century. The plastered ceiling in the inner room is dated to the early 18th century. On the first floor there are plain-chamfered ceiling beams and roof trusses, although this is obscured. In the 18th century the first floor was converted into an assembly room, and subsequently the High Sheriff for the county often met with noblemen of the county at the Bear Inn. The Glamorganshire Agricultural Society was established in 1772 at the inn. In this era, the inn served as a stopping point for those in need of changing horses, while other similar establishments, such as the Cowbridge Arms, Royal Oak, and Spread Eagle did not offer such a service. The northern side of the house once had wing attached to it during the medieval period but this no longer exists. In the early 19th century, Christopher Bradley was succeeded by Michael Glover as inn host. In the early 20th century, the county Court occasionally sat at the Bear Inn when it had such needs in Cowbridge. Nearby is the Cowbridge Grammar School.

It is located about 4 km from the town of Albenga in a narrow strip of plain between the river Centa and the foothills bordering the plain to the south. The mountains are called the rock of pistul√®. The name derives from the fundi rustic as Antognano, Aregliano, Velirano, Verano, all large-scale and exploiting the fertile plain. The country is crossed by a river named Rio Carpaneto. The town developed along the ridge with a rather complex system, likely evidence of a more ancient origin than the other city of the plain. During the excavations for the construction of a new residential complex in the region of in Rusineo, there were the ruins of a Roman villa of considerable size, which indicates a Roman presence in the area.  Geography  Lusignano is in the first hinterland of Albenga, in the west Riviera. Its historical part is on the hills, including the parts of the expansion, to broaden the town boasts the surrounding plan. In the end of 20th century there was an expansion of cottages in the surrounding area. However, the significant part coincides with the historical part, that is developed with a main street,Via Enrico D'Aste. It starting from the bottom tapering through the village, on its way this is different squares, also of limited size. The upper part of the route has been subject to redevelopment in 2011 with a project and funds from the Region of Liguria. The character is a village built on sloping ground, in the valley of the Rio Carpaneto. The landmark of the country is definitely the bell, even if it is dominated by the presence of the nearby Mount Pisciavino.  Monuments and places of interest  Interior of the church of Saint Margaret the Virgin  Religious architectures  = Church of Saint Margaret the Virgin = The parish church of the village is dedicated to Saint Margaret, know ad Santa Margherita in italian. In 1402, Pope Boniface IV delegated the benefit of Santa Margherita of Lusignano to Antonio Sismondi, known as \\"de Ponte\\". On 9 February 1430 the church received a new priest for the care of souls, it was the last act of the two vicars of the provisional government of the diocese, the day after he took office to Albenga the new bishop Matteo Del Carretto. The baptistery arrived under the bishop's care of Napoleone Fieschi on October 14 1460, with the obligation of 10 soldi to be paid to the archpriest; this permit will later be withdrawn without explanation. He was appointed to the parish title thanks to Monsignor Giacomo Gambarana, who grants the baptismal font to the rector on 1 June 1523, always with the obligation to pay 10 soldi a year to the archpriest of cathedral ingauna, with the obligation to serve in the cathedral on Holy Saturday, on the eve of Pentecost, and on the feast of the patron saint Archangel Michael. From 1598 the patronal church was submitted to the patronage of the Albenganese Cepolla family. In 1629 - 1630 the inhabitants decided to enlarge the parish church with a \\"majestic choro at noon\\". The low fa√ßade was divided vertically into three parts and the bell tower from 16th century was preserved. Expanded in the following centuries, with a major modification in Baroque age, the ceiling is decorated with a bas- relief that should have ended with gold beads in the part near the altar, a symbol that for a war or for a famine could not finish the work. Inside there are the processional statues of Bartholomew the Apostle and Margaret the Virgin made by Antonio Brilla in the mid 19th century. There is a statue of Saint Bartholomew from the 16th century. Inside the church there are 4 paintings and a cycle of paintings of the Stations of the Cross. The church has a Latin plan with 3 naves with a high altar of which the choir is behind. The facade was restored in the 90s of the 20th century. = Oratory of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle = In the hamlet there is the Oratory of Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, seat of the homonymous brotherhood. The present oratory derives from a reconstruction which took place around 1780, following the collapse of the previous structure.  Roman country villa  The archaeological site was discovered in 1995, during the works for the group of buildings of Rusineo, along the piedmont strip, which limits towards south the flat ground of Albenga, between the outlying wards of Lusignano and Barbano. The archaeological area goes towards east-west on a hillock, raised by about ten meters as to the flat ground; here it is possible to recognize the remains of a farm or of the pars rustica of a villa. The area overlooks Albenga and the sea and it is safe from the violent floods of Arroscia river, but near a small river: it is a perfect location, fully in accordance with the prescriptions suggested by the antique sources for a villa perfecta. The north, south and west sides of a large rectangular yard are partially kept; the yard is 24 meters wide, formed by brickworks in concrete, covered with stones with irregular shapes. The east side of the yard, as well as the brickworks which were in the west side of the yard itself, have been fully removed over the time, probably when, in recent times, the area has been terraced with agricultural aims and wide earth movings have been carried out. On the north side of the yard, there are four adjoining spaces, with floor made of ground, used perhaps in the past as service areas, or as shelter for the tools. The southern part of the yard, today covered, is, on the contrary, fully occupied by one area only, rather narrow and elongated, interpretable as a stable. Some tiles, cemented along the wall limiting the inner side of the yard, slightly sloping towards the external, seem actually canalizations for the discharge of sewage, while in the near small basin, whose bottom covered with mortar and pottery fragments is still kept, it is possible to see a drinking trough. The archaeological stratigraphy allows to distinguish a continuity of life of the site, from its building, about at the st th beginning of the 1 century A.D., until the 5 century. The whole archaeological area is now under protection according to the Ministerial Decree 6.11.1995 and 7.7.1997.

Debunking Youth Unemployment Youth unemployment is the situation of young people who are looking for a job, but cannot find a job, with the age range being that defined by the United Nations as 15‚Äì24 years old. An unemployed person is defined as someone who does not have a job but is actively seeking work. In order to qualify as unemployed for official and statistical measurement, the individual must be without employment, willing and able to work, of the officially designated \\"working age\\" (often from the teens to the mid-60s) and actively searching for a position. Youth unemployment rates tend to be higher than the adult rates in every country in the world.  Background  There are 1.2 billion youth in the world aged between 15 and 24, accounting for 17% of the world's population. 87% of them live in developing countries. The age range defined by the United Nations addresses the period when mandatory schooling ends until the age of 24. This definition remains controversial as it not only impacts unemployment statistics but also plays an important role in the targeted solutions designed by policy makers in the world. Two main debates are ongoing today. First, defining the age range of youth is not as obvious as it seems. Two theoretical perspectives have dominated this debate. Youth can be seen as a stage in life between adolescence and adulthood or as a socially constructed group with its own sub-culture, making it difficult to establish a comparable age range between countries. Second, the definition of unemployment itself leads to the possibility of not accounting for a number of young people left out of work. Those who do not have a job and are not actively seeking work ‚Äì often womenYouth and Skills: Putting Education to Work, UNESCO, 2012 ‚Äì are considered inactive and are therefore excluded in unemployment statistics. Their inclusion would substantially increase the unemployment rate. Causes There are multiple and complex causes behind youth unemployment. Among them, the quality and relevance of education, inflexible labour market and regulations, which in turn create a situation of assistance and dependency, are the main causes discussed today. From education to employment: the skills crisis The quality and relevance of education is often considered as the first root cause of youth unemployment.Global Agenda Councils -Youth Unemployment Visualization , World Economic Forum, 2013 In 2010, in 25 out of 27 developed countries, the highest unemployment rate was among people with primary education or lessKey Indicators of the Labour Market (KILM) , ILO, Seventh Edition Yet, high education does not guarantee a decent job. For example, in Tunisia, 40% of university graduates are unemployed against 24% of non-graduates. This affects highly educated young females in particular. \\"In Turkey, the unemployment rate among university educated women is more than 3 times higher than that of university educated men; in Iran and the United Arab Emirates, it is nearly 3 times; and in Saudi Arabia, it is 8 times\\". Beyond the necessity to ensure its access to all, education is not adequately tailored to the needs of the labour market, which in turns leads to two consequences: the inability for young people to find jobs and the inability for employers to hire the skills they need. Combined with the economic crisis and the lack of sufficient job creation in many countries, it has resulted in high unemployment rates around the world and the development of a skills crisis. Surveys suggest that up to half of all businesses have open positions for which they are struggling to find suitably qualified people.City & Guilds Centre for Skills Development, Skills Development, Attitudes and Perceptions, March 2008 One global survey found that more than 55% of employers worldwide believe there is a \\"skill crisis\\" as businesses witness a growing mismatch between the skills students learn in the education system and those required in the workplace. For many governments, a key question is how they can bridge this gap and ensure that young people are equipped with the skills employers are looking for. Labour markets and regulations Labour-market-Supply-demand-Unemployment-cs First, a high level of employment protection regulations causes employers to be cautious about hiring more than a minimum number of workers, since they cannot easily be laid off during a downturn, or fired if a new employee should turn out to be unmotivated or incompetent.Gomez-Salvador, R and Leiner-Killinger, N. An Analysis of Youth Unemployment in the Euro Area . Frankfurt: European Central Bank, 2008 Second, the development of temporary forms of work such as internships, seasonal jobs and short term contracts have left young workers in precarious situations. Because their jobs are temporary contracts, youth are often the first to be laid off when a company downsizes. If they are laid off, youth are typically not eligible for redundancy payments because they only worked with the company for a short period of time. Once this work ends, many find themselves unemployed and disadvantaged in the job search. However, some youth are entering work on a part-time basis during tertiary education. This rate is low in countries like Italy, Spain and France but in the United States almost one-third of students combine education and work. The legitimacy of internships has begun to be questioned. The purpose of internships is to allow students or recent graduates to acquire work experience and a recommendation letter to add to their curriculum vitae. However, many interns have complained that they are simply performing basic grunt-work, rather than learning important knowledge and skills. Whether or not these internship positions are now violating the federal rules that are in place to govern programmes such as internships remains to be seen. The internship however, seems to be the only viable alternative to job placement for the young individual. With little to no job growth occurring, the unemployment rate among those fresh out of college and at the later end of the 15-24 aged youth spectrum is approximately 13.2% as of April 2012. Assistance and dependency the trend of aid dependency in low income country Many countries around the world provide income assistance to support unemployed youth until labour market and economic conditions improve.OECD Action Plan for Youth , 2013 Although this support is strictly related to obligations in terms of active job search and training, it has led to an emerging debate on whether or not it creates dependency among the youth and has a detrimental effect on them.Handbook of Youth and Young Adulthood: New Perspectives and Agendas, Andy Furlong, 2009 In September 2014, David Cameron announced that he would cut housing and employment benefits for 18- to 21-year-olds by ¬£3,000 to ¬£23,000Removing the safety net? Cameron targets young benefit cuts , Channel 4, 28 September 2014 to reduce dependency on government assistance and redirect funding to targeted programmes for increased learning and training opportunities. Case studies The individual experiences of youth unemployment vary from country to country. Definitions of youth can also vary from country to country so examination of particular countries gives a greater insight into the causes and consequences of youth unemployment. Africa African countries define youth as someone from as young as 15 to someone well into their mid thirties, which varies from the standardized definition of the United Nations. Africa has the youngest population of any continent which means that the problem of youth unemployment in the continent particularly relevant. Although youth unemployment is high, this does not necessarily make the causes of unemployment youth-specific; many of the causes of unemployment, such as poor infrastructure or insufficient educational qualifications, affect older and younger Africans alike. Approximately 200 million people in Africa are between the ages of 15 and 24. This number is expected to double in size in the next 30 years. Between 2001 and 2010, countries in Africa reported some of the world's fasted growing economies. In Africa, the message the youth are receiving from schools and adults is to become job creators rather than job-seekers, which encourages them to become entrepreneurs. Every year, up to 12 million graduates are entering the labour market and only 3 million of them are getting jobs. This shows that \\"the mountain of youth unemployment is rising annually.‚Äù Canada Canada's economy has braved the global recession better than many others. But last year, 14.3% of Canadian youth were unemployed, up from 11.2% in 2007 and double the current national jobless rate of 7.2%, according to Statistics Canada. That amounts to the biggest gap between youth and adult unemployment rates since 1977. The average post-secondary graduate carries $28,000 in student debt. The unemployment rate for Canadian young people is about double that of the rest of the population. In Canada's largest province, Ontario, the rate of unemployment for those between the ages of 15‚Äì24 is hovering around 13%. The percentage of youth in Ontario who actually have a job hasn't climbed above 52% this year. Toronto's youth unemployment rate is at 18%, but only 43% of the area's youth are employed, the lowest rate in the province. European Union Due to the great recession in Europe, in 2009, only 15% of males and 10% of females between ages 16‚Äì19 in were employed full- time. The youth employment rate in the European Union reached an all-time low of 32.9% in the first half of 2011.Furlong, Andy. \\"Chapter 4.\\" Youth Studies an Introduction. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2013. 75. Print. Of the countries in the European Union Germany sticks outs with its low rate of 7.9%. Some critics argue that the decrease of the youth unemployment began even before the economic downturn, countries such as Greece and Spain. In October 2019, 3.2 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU-28, of whom 2.26 million were in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.4% in the EU-28 and 15.6% in the euro area, compared with about 25% in 2013. The lowest rates were observed in Czechia (5.5%) and Germany (5.8%) , while the highest were recorded in Greece (33.1% in the second quarter of 2019), Spain (32.8%) and Italy (27.8%).Eurostat page on unemployment Various countries have enacted a Youth Guarantee plan targeting youth unemployment.Youth Guarantee country by country  France  In 2017 the youth unemployment rate in France was 22.3%, relatively high compared to the overall unemployment rate of 8.9%. France has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment among the EU countries, trialing behind Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal. The level of education is a factor that affects unemployment for the French youth population. Those who do not enter into higher education programmes have an employment rate of 30% which is exceedingly low compared to an employment rate of more than 80% for those who entered into higher education.Cahuc, Pierre; Carcillo, St√©phane; Zimmermann, Klaus F. (2013) : The Employment of the Low- Skilled Youth in France, IZA Policy Paper, No. 64, Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), Bonn France also experiences a large high school drop out rate, resulting in a high population of low-skilled youth workers. Lacking vocational training or adequate skills that employers look for, many French youths are without options for employment. This issue of unemployment has been on the French agenda for decades and has prompted many efforts to reduce its impact. In 2010 France established a labour law to set a statutory minimum wage for the youth population. Also, public programmes include the promotion of job training to better equip workers to enter novel positions, creating more jobs particularly for low-skilled workers, and reducing labour costs through subsidies and other efforts.Foug√®re, Denis & Kramarz, Francis & Magnac, Thierry, 2000. \\"Youth Employment Policies In France,\\"CEPR Discussion Papers 2394, C.E.P.R. Discussion Papers. Compared to other highly developed and OECD member countries, France displays higher unemployment rates as well as longer duration. From 1983 to 2018 youth unemployment rate in France experienced an overall increase. It averaged at a rate of 20.19% reaching a max of 26.2% in 2012. From 1979 to 1984, France saw its legislated minimum wage, the SMIC (salaire minimum interprofessional de croissance), rise sharply. Historically, a rise in the SMIC has shown to result in increased unemployment rates amongst the country's youth population. At the end of this period, the unemployment rate for youths was 26%, almost double the average OECD youth unemployment rate. France also saw double digit declines in active youths in the labour market from the years 1980 - 2007. In an effort to combat youth unemployment, France attempted to improve their education system because France sees declining rates of unemployment amongst those who have received higher levels of education. The less educated however, not only experience increased unemployment rates, but longer durations of unemployment. For instance, in 1996, 58% of the lowest educated labour market population experienced an average of one year of unemployment. France has made achievements in increasing higher education amongst its youth, attaining the Europe 2020 target of reducing early school leaving to below 10%. France offers mostly free higher education and the government supplies students with stipends. Like other countries in the European Union, France has enacted school-to-work policies in order to facilitate the school-two-work transition for youths once they've completed their higher education. They have longer transition time for students entering the work force and include offers newly graduated students several tools to enhance their market inclusion. The government has taken several measures in an effort to lower labour costs such as subsidized employment contracts and multiple VET placements. However, these policies have appeared to return minor results as the country continues to report high youth unemployment rates especially among differing social classes. First, they are less effective among the youth migrant population who face disconnect from the labour market due to France's employment-centred economy experiencing, on average, unemployment rates that are 4% higher than non-migrant workers. Furthermore, there is also prevalent gender disparities among the younger population.  Greece  Youth unemployment levels in Greece remain one of the highest in the world. According to one source, between 2000 and 2008, youth inactivity increased from 63% to 72%. A different source using the harmonized definition of unemployment lists the unemployment rate of youth up to 24 years of age as 24.2% in Greece during 2009. To put this into perspective, the EU-27 average at the time was 18.3%. Youth unemployment rose to 40.1% in May 2011 and then again to about 55% in November 2012. In addition to youth unemployment (namely those up to 25 years of age), Greece also faced severe graduate unemployment of those 25‚Äì29 years of age. In 1998, Greece had the highest level of unemployment of higher education graduates in the 25-29 year old age group. This was due to a lack of demand for highly educated personnel at the time. This trend of low employment among those with higher educational qualifications continues on today. As recently as 2009, \\"one in three higher education graduates, two in three secondary graduates, and one in three compulsory education graduates have not found some form of stable employment.\\" This lack of employment is thought to have contributed to the feelings of frustration among youth that eventually led to the 2008 Greek riots. These high levels of unemployment are exacerbated by the failure of unions to attract young workers. GSEE's Young Workers Committee revealed in a 2008 presentation that almost two-thirds of young workers did not joined their workplace unions. Although unions like GSEE and ADEDY actively promote wage increases through collective bargaining efforts and have contributed to obtaining higher wages for young workers, the wages of young workers remained much lower than almost all other countries in EU-15.  India  The youth unemployment rate was around 10% in 2005, but they haven't reliably reported statistics to the United Nations over the years. However, there has been an increase in young adults remaining in school and getting additional degrees simply because there aren't opportunities for employment. These youth are typically of a lower class, but it can represent a wide variety of individuals across races and classes. They call the phenomenon 'timepass' because the youth are simply passing time in college while waiting for a paid employment opportunity. In India, the employment system is often reliant on connections or government opportunities.  Italy  Within the Eurozone, only Greece and Spain display higher rates of youth unemployment than Italy. Similarly to Spain, the percentage of people aged 15‚Äì24 excluded from the labour market saw a dramatic rise in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Between 2008 and 2014, youth unemployment rose by 21.5%. By that year, almost 43% of the young were excluded from the labour market in Italy. Furthermore, youth unemployment is unequally distributed throughout the country. In the third quarter of 2014, only 29.7% of the young were unemployed in the North. This number increases to an alarming 51.5% when looking at the South of Italy. Jordan There are 15 million unemployed young men in Arab communities. The youth unemployment rate in Jordan has traditionally been much higher than other countries. In the past ten years, the rate has stayed around 23%. There has been a recent increase in the popular belief that unemployment is the fault of the individual and not a societal problem. However, youth unemployment has also been attributed to increased pressure on service sectors that typically employ more youth in Jordan. Youth unemployment has led to later and later ages of marriage in Jordan, which some view as one of the most important consequences of the phenomenon. Another consequence experienced in Jordan is increased mental health problems. In 2019, the estimated youth unemployment rate in Jordan was at 35%.  Kenya  Kenya, which one of the quickest growing economies in Sub-Saharan Africa, averaging GDP growth of 5.7% in 2019, has one of the highest youth unemployment rates in East Africa and data from the country's recent census indicates a worsening unemployment for youth aged between 18-34 years. According to the 2019 census, more than a third of Kenya‚Äôs youth eligible for work have no jobs. A total of 5,341,182 (38.9%) of the 13,777,600 young Kenyans are jobless. The conventional population of youth aged 18 to 34 is 13.7 million, out of which 61% are working while 1.6 million are seeking work or indicated that there was no work available. Kenya's young people are considered to be a key resource in the economic transformation of the country. With at least 20% of the country‚Äôs population between the age of 15 to 24, the East African nation has been touted as one of the countries that can reap a demographic dividend by providing the appropriate education and jobs to its growing youth population. The Kenya Youth Development Policy 2019, which was launched on 12 August 2020 during the national celebrations of International Youth Day, recognizes the creativity, innovativeness, and productivity presented by youth and their potential to become transformative leaders as key strengths, and promises to harness these strengths for the realization of the demographic dividend. The policy provides a framework to address some of the challenges faced by youth in Kenya, including lack of decent jobs.  Russia  Youth unemployment in Russia was over 18% in 2010. However, there was a wide variance in levels of unemployment in Russia just a few years earlier, that continued through the 2008 economic crisis. In 2005, the area around Moscow had an unemployment rate of just 1% while the Dagestan region had a rate over 22%. This may be partially attributed to the differences in levels of development in the region. It has been found that the higher the level of development in a region, the lower the level of both overall and youth-specific unemployment. In Russia, the main cause of youth unemployment has been attributed to lower levels of human capital.  South Africa  Starting in the 1970s, youth unemployment has been rising at a steady rate in South Africa. Today, South Africa is ranked as the fourth country with the highest percentage of unemployed youth in the world. As of 2014, 52.6% of the people aged 15‚Äì24 actively looking for a job were unemployed. Furthermore, youth unemployment is unequally distributed throughout different segments of the population. While unemployment between young whites amounts to 12%, this number skyrockets to a troubling 70% between young blacks.Mlatsheni, C., & Sandrine, R. (2002). Why is Youth Unemployment so High and Unequally spread in South Africa? University of Cape Town. It may be that remnant effects of the apartheid era has led to jobs centres being located farther away from typical homes of black communities compared to white communities. This, lingering discrimination, and unequal backgrounds are among the many reasons for the lopsided distribution of unemployment among young white and black South Africans. Many of the unemployed youth have never worked before. A proposed reason for this is that South Africa's social pension programme is relatively generous compared to other middle-income countries. Some senior South Africans (mostly applicable to the white population) are paid almost twice the per capita income. This has led to many of the unemployed youth surviving off of their elders' support, thereby reducing incentives to look for employment. In addition, the reservation wages of many young Africans are prohibitively high. Around 60% of males and 40% of females have reservation wages that are higher than they could expect from smaller sized firms. Some overestimate their ability to obtain jobs from competitive, high-paying, larger sized firms and thus remain unemployed. The higher pay of larger firms, in addition to the costs of employment (such as transport or housing costs), make it almost unfeasible for some youth to accept lower paying jobs from smaller firms. Thus, many of the youth in South Africa choose to remain unemployed until they are able to find a job at a larger firm. South African youth also face problems of education. Many exit the schooling system early. Others face a lack of skill recognition from employers, \\"even if they have qualifications in the fields that are considered to be in high demand.\\"Garcia, J. R. (2011). Desempleo juvenil en Espa√±a: causas y soluciones. Madrid: BBVA. In the first quarter of 2020, there were 20.4 million young people aged 15‚Äì34 years. These young people accounted for 63.3% of the total number of unemployed persons. The unemployment rate within this group was 43.2% in the 1st quarter of 2020. The youth aged 15‚Äì24 years are the most vulnerable in the South African labour market as the unemployment rate among this age group was 59.0% in the 1st quarter of 2020. Among graduates in this age group, the unemployment rate was 33.1% during this period compared to 24.6% in the 4th quarter of 2019 ‚Äì an increase of 8.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter.  Spain  In recent decades, the issue of youth unemployment has assumed alarming proportions in Spain. The country was dramatically hit by the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 and the number of young unemployed skyrocketed during this period. Within OECD countries, Spain displayed the most significant increases in terms of job losses within those aged 15‚Äì24.Scarpetta, S., A. Sonnet and T. Manfredi (2010), \\"Rising Youth Unemployment During The Crisis: How to Prevent Negative Long-term Consequences on a Generation?\\", OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers, No. 106, OECD Publishing, Paris. By 2014, 57.9% of the youth in Spain was unemployed. The failed implementation of effective employment policies and the increased segmentation of the labour marked during the economic recession are thought to be the main causes behind such an alarming situation. United Kingdom Youth unemployment in the United Kingdom is the level of unemployment among young people, typically defined as those aged 18‚Äì25. A related concept is graduate unemployment which is the level of unemployment among university graduates. Statistics for June 2010 show that there are 926,000 young people under the age of 25 who are unemployed which equates to an unemployment rate of 19.6% among young people. This is the highest youth unemployment rate in 17 years. In November 2011 youth unemployment hit 1.02 million, but had fallen to 767,000 by August 2014. The high levels of youth unemployment in the United Kingdom have led some politicians and media commentators to talk of a \\"lost generation\\". United States The general unemployment rate in the United States has increased in the last 5 years, but the youth unemployment rate has jumped almost 10 percentage points. In 2007, before the most recent recession began, youth unemployment was already at 13%. By 2008, this rate had jumped to 18% and in 2010 it had climbed to just under 21%. The length of time the youth are unemployed has expanded as well, with many youth in the United States remaining unemployed after more than a year of searching for a job. This has caused the creation of a scarred generation, as discussed below. An estimated 9.4 million young people ages 16 to 24 in the United States (12.3%) are neither working nor in school.Sarah Burd-Sharps and Kristen Lewis. Promising Gains, Persistent Gaps: Youth Disconnection in America . 2017. Measure of America of the Social Science Research Council. an estimated 20.9 million young people ages 16 to 24 in the United States (12.3%) are employed in the United States. The unemployment rate for youth was 9.6% in July, down by 1.9 percentage points from July 2016. The demographic of unemployment among youth in the United States as of July 2017, show that the unemployment rates for both young men (10.1%) and women (9.1%) were lower than the summer before. The July 2017 rates for young Whites (8.0%) and Blacks (16.2%) declined over the year, while the rates for young Asians (9.9%) and Hispanics (10.1%) showed little change. In August 2020, youth unemployment stood at 14.7%. Effects A lost generation Unemployed youth has been called \\"a lost generation\\": not only because of productivity lost but also because of the long-term direct and indirect impact unemployment has on young people and their families. Unemployment has been said to affect earnings for about 20 years. Because they aren't able to build up skills or experience during their first years in the workforce, unemployed youth see a decrease in lifetime earnings when compared to those who had steady work or those who were unemployed as an adult. A lower salary can persist for 20 years following the unemployed period before the individual begins earning competitively to their peers. Widespread youth unemployment also leads to a socially excluded generation at great risk for poverty. For example, Spain saw an 18% increase in income inequality. The lost generation effect impacts also their families. Youth in many countries now live with their parents into their late twenties. This contributes to what is called the \\"full-nest syndrome\\". In 2008, 46% of 18- to 34-year-olds in the European Union lived with at least one parent; in most countries the stay-at- homes were more likely to be unemployed than those who had moved out.The jobless young. Left behind , The Economist, 10 September 2011 In families, it is common that when one person becomes unemployed, other members of the family begin looking for or securing employment. This is called the added worker effect. This can sometimes take the form of employment in the informal sector when necessary. Alongside the shift in youth living situations, the impact of returning to live with parents as well as difficulty finding a fulfilling job lead to mental health risks. Being unemployed for a long period of time in youth has been correlated to decreased happiness, job satisfaction and other mental health issues. Unemployed youth also report more isolation from their community. Youth who are neither working nor studying do not have the opportunity to learn and improve their skills. They are progressively marginalised from the labour market and in turn can develop an anti-social behaviour. Political unrest and increased public spending 2011 Moroccan protests The rise of political unrest and anti-social behaviour in the world has been recently attributed to youth unemployment. During the course of 2011 it became a key factor in fuelling protests around the globe. Within twelve months, four regimes (Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen) in the Arab World fell in the wake of the protests led by young people. Riots and protests similarly engulfed a number of European and North American cities (Spain, France, United Kingdom between 2008 and 2011 for example). The lack of productive engagement of young people in wider society, underlined by high levels of unemployment and under-employment, only serves to add to this feeling of disenfranchisement. Youth unemployment also dramatically increases public spending at times when economies are struggling to remain competitive and social benefits increase along with an aging population. Youth unemployment has direct costs such as increased benefit payments, lost income-tax revenues and wasted capacity. \\"In Britain a report by the London School of Economics (LSE), the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Prince's Trust puts the cost of the country's 744,000 unemployed youngsters at ¬£155m ($247m) a week in benefits and lost productivity\\". Similarly, the economic loss from youth unemployment in Europe is estimated at ‚Ç¨153 billion or 1.2% of GDP in 2011.Demystifying Youth Unemployment , Tse, Esposito, Chatzimarkakis, September 2013 Youth unemployment has indirect costs too, including emigration. Young people leave their countries in hope to find employment elsewhere. This brain drain has contributed to deteriorating countries' competitiveness, especially in Europe. A lack of innovation The economic crisis has led to a global decrease in competitiveness. \\"There is a risk of loss of talent and skills since a great amount of university graduates are unable to find a job and to put their knowledge and capabilities into producing innovation and contributing to economic growth\\".Consequences of high youth unemployment, Bridging Europe, 27 April 2014 Excluding young people from the labour market means lacking the divergent thinking, creativity and innovation that they naturally offer. This fresh thinking is necessary for employers to foster new designs and innovative ideas. Fighting youth unemployment is therefore key to maintaining the economic performance of a country.  Incarceration and mortality  A 2015 study showed that New York City's 'Summer Youth Employment Program' decreased the participants' probability of incarceration and probability of mortality. Effects of minimum wages Economic research indicates that minimum wages increases youth unemployment in competitive labour markets for unskilled youth labour, and that the resulting delayed entry into the job market (for youths who are unable to obtain a job) leads to a reduction in training opportunities and thus a reduction in lifetime income. However, research also indicates that \\"imposing a minimum wage may increase the income of working youths if their hours of work are not reduced in response to the minimum wage\\" and \\"minimum wages may increase the aggregate income of youths if the gains for those who work exceed the losses for those who cannot find work.\\" As a policy measure to support young unskilled workers, economist Charlene Marie Kalenkoski suggests that \\"instead of a minimum wage, policymakers should use less distortionary means to support young unskilled workers, such as cash or in-kind assistance.\\" Possible solutions The role of labour market policy and institutions Job Advertisement Board in Shenzhen -01 The role of labour market policy and institutions varies a lot from countries to countries. Here is a brief account of key propositions recently elaborated to facilitate access to employment for youth. First, a more balanced employment protection for permanent and temporary workers is needed. It will ensure that young people who lack work experience can prove their abilities and skills to then progressively transition to regular employment. It will also encourage a more equal treatment between permanent and temporary workers and help combat informal employment. This proposition has led to multiple discussions on flexible contracts to be designed and offered to youth. Second, discussions are focused on the level and spread of income support provided to unemployed youth. While some countries consider shifting their support from direct financial assistance to funding apprenticeship, others are increasing their support tying it back to stricter obligations of active search and training. Third, Governments are progressively involving employers and trainers to create a holistic approach to youth unemployment and provide intensive programmes with focus on remedial education, work experience and adult mentoring. One Active Labour Market Policy (ALMP) that many governments have put emphasis on in an attempt to tackle unemployment is to directly help unemployed individuals transition to self-employment. Various pan-European studies have shown great success of these programmes with regards to job creation and overall well- being. TVET and vocational education TVET as a proportion of all upper secondary programmes The case has been made the past few years on the need to provide technical training to youth to prepare them specifically for a job. TVET and Vocational education would help address the skills crisis. Some countries ‚Äì among them Switzerland, The Netherlands, Singapore, Austria, Norway and Germany ‚Äì have been remarkably successful in developing vocational education ‚Äì and have reduced youth unemployment to as little as half the OECD average. Three main reasons are usually presented for why vocational education should be a part of political programmes to combat youth unemployment: * First, case studies show that strong vocational training programmes reduce unemployment and increase wages. A range of country studies has consistently demonstrated a link between completion of vocational education and a reduced probability of unemployment and higher earnings.CEDEFOP, The benefits of vocational education and training, 2011; OECD Review of Vocational Education and Training ‚Äì Learning for Jobs, 2011; CEDEFOP, Vocational Education and Training, Key to the Future, 2010. In countries where enrolment in in-company vocational education is less than 15%, the likelihood that young people will be unemployed is double that of countries where enrolment is over 15%. * Second, vocational education increases employers' productivity. A range of studies across countries has found that higher investment in vocational training is associated with increases in productivity. * Third, vocational education has significant social benefits: vocational education has been linked in studies to improved income equality, greater social inclusion, lower crime rates, and improved health and well being.CEDEFOP, The benefits of vocational education and training, 2011 To the extent that vocational education reduces unemployment, it also brings the broader social benefits associated with high employment. Foundational skills have also been identified as key to a successful transition to work. \\"Across OECD countries, PISA results indicate that almost one in five students do not reach a basic minimum level of skills to function in today's societies\\". On average, 20% of young adults drop out before completing upper secondary education level. Vocational education aims at teaching foundational skills, as well as providing another option to general education pathways with practical job training. Many countries around the world offer programmes to improve youth skills and employability. Once of them is Turkey, which focused training students with skills that would help them in running one‚Äôs own business, as well as entrepreneurship. The United Kingdom and Australia have tried to modernize apprenticeships. Indeed these are used to provide training for youths in non- traditional occupations. Measures for youth and employment have focused on easing transitions from school or training to work and jobs, as for instance careers information, advice and guidance services. Teaching 21st-century skills  The education system plays a central role in the debate about the youth labour market crisis. What has become evident is that there need to be major changes in what we teach and in the way we teach. One prominent approach taken by various educators is to shift teaching from knowledge-centred teaching to skills-centred teaching.Charles Fadel. 21st Century Skills: Learning for Life in Our Times (2009). Wiley21st Century Skills , Generation Jobless, 2015 \\"In order to materialize the shift from exclusively content- based to a balanced content-and-skill-based curricula, education providers should make it their goal to establish a guiding skills framework which allows teachers and professors to see the types of skills and applied content they should be transmitting to their students. All educational institutions should work towards adopting or creating a suitable skills framework that aligns with the labour market, which is flexible enough for educators to adapt their subject or grade level. Moreover, this framework should act as a living document that schools and universities can modify to fit their communities or to accommodate changes in the market.\\"Generation Jobless? , Palgrave MacMillan, 2015 Entrepreneurship Media Entrepreneurship Definition When taking into consideration the need to foster competitiveness through innovation and creativity, recent studies have advocated for entrepreneurship as a viable a solution to youth unemployment. With the right structure and facilitated administrative processes, young people could create enterprises as means to find and create new jobs. According to the OECD, Small and Medium Enterprises are today's main employers with 33% of jobs created over the last ten years. It shows that big companies no longer represent the main sources of employment and that there is a necessity to prepare young people for an entrepreneurship culture. This alternative is often regarded as a way to empower young people to take their future into their hands: it means investing in teaching them the leadership and management skills they need to become innovators and entrepreneurs. These skills also include: communication, teamwork, decision-making, organisational skills and self-confidence. This solution ties back with labour market and regulations as many reforms are yet to be implemented to ensure that the market is flexible enough to incentivize young people to create enterprises. Target tax and business incentives are key to support young entrepreneurs in creating and scaling their businesses. A systematic review assessed the evidence on the effectiveness of different types of interventions to improve labour market outcomes of youth. The evidence suggests that youth employment interventions overall increase employment and earnings, but effects are small and highly variable. This review found that interventions geared toward entrepreneurship promotion and skills training show mostly positive, and some statistically significant, effects, while programmes providing employment services and subsidized employment show negligible effects. Effectiveness also seems to depend on contextual aspects including country, programme design, and characteristics of recipients. Assistance to youth in the transition to the world of work A number of studies have shown that young people are not sufficiently advised on work-related opportunities, necessary skills and career pathways. Before they leave education, it appears critical that they have access to this information to be better prepared for what to expect and what is expected of them. Good quality career guidance along with labour market prospects should help young people make better career choices. Some young people choose to study a field that results in few opportunities for future jobs. Governments, employers and trainers should work together to provide clearer pathways to youth. Similarly, programmes should be developed to better transition young people to the world of work. Here, vocational education and apprenticeship systems have shown that practice and on-the-job training can have a positive effect.

Life He was the son of Gabriel Stadler (1811‚Äìc.1876) and Katharina Margarethe (Nett) Stadler (1808‚Äì1886). Gabriel Stadler was an inn-keeper in Germersheim, and took part in the failed German Revolution of 1848. The family emigrated to the United States in 1851, and settled in New York City where Gabriel became an engraver. Charles attended the St. Nicholas Parochial School, other public schools, and De La Salle Institute. During the American Civil War, he fought with the 55th New York Volunteers, and finished the war as a sergeant major. On July 17, 1866, he married Josephine Contes (1848‚Äì1883), and they had eight children. He became an engraver and worked in his father's shop until 1871. Then he became a brewer and later engaged in the malting business, building the largest malting company in the United States. He was an Inspector of Public Schools from 1877 to 1879; and was a member of the New York State Senate (9th D.) from 1888 to 1891, sitting in the 111th, 112th, 113th and 114th New York State Legislatures. On June 21, 1888, he married Pauline Roesicke (born 1866). In 1897, his malting business became part of the American Malting Company, and Stadler was President of the company from 1900 to 1916. In 1903, he proposed to deactivate the Erie Canal, and use the right-of-way of the canal bed to lay railroad tracks instead, and then ship freight (especially his grains and malts) by rail. Besides being faster than the canal boats, the rail transport would work all year round, while the canals were closed during the winter when the water froze to ice. During his last years, he spent the winters at \\"Seminole Grove\\", an estate with an extensive game preserve and fruit orchards, near Fort Myers, Florida, and died there in May 1928.

It appeared in the short-story collection Twenty-Three Tales which was first translated into English for an edition released by Funk & Wagnalls in 1907. The title refers to its three central characters; unnamed simple monks living on a remote island in a life of prayer and contemplation \\"for the salvation of their souls.\\" Plot A bishop and several pilgrims are travelling on a fishing boat from Archangel to the Solov√©tsk Monastery. During the voyage, the bishop overhears a discussion about a remote island, nearby their course, where three old hermits live a spartan existence focused on seeking \\"salvation for their souls.\\" Inquiring about the hermits, the bishop finds that several of the fishermen claim to have seen the hermits once. The bishop then informs the captain that he wishes to visit the island. The captain seeks to dissuade him by saying, \\"the old men are not worth your pains. I have heard say that they are foolish old fellows, who understand nothing, and never speak a word.\\" The bishop insists and the captain steers the ship toward the island. The bishop subsequently sets off in a rowboat to visit. He is met ashore by the three hermits. The bishop informs the hermits that he has heard of them and of their search for salvation. He inquires how they are seeking salvation and serving God, but the hermits say they do not know how, only that they pray, simply: \\"Three are ye, three are we, have mercy upon us.\\" Subsequently, the bishop acknowledges that they have a little knowledge but are ignorant of the true meaning of the doctrine and how to pray properly. He tells them that he will teach them \\"not a way of my own, but the way in which God in the Holy Scriptures has commanded all men to pray to Him\\" and proceeds to explain the doctrines of the incarnation and the Trinity. He attempts to teach them the Lord's Prayer, the \\"Our Father\\", but the simple hermits blunder and cannot remember the words. This compels the bishop to repeat the lesson late into the night. After he is satisfied that they have memorized the prayer, the Bishop departs from the island leaving the hermits with a firm instruction to pray as he has taught them. The bishop then returns to the fisherman's vessel anchored offshore in the rowboat and continues his voyage. While on board, the bishop notices that their vessel is being followed. At first he thinks a boat is behind them but he soon realizes that the three hermits are running across the surface of the water \\"as though it were dry land.\\" The hermits catch up to the vessel as the captain stops the boat, and inform the bishop, \\"We have forgotten your teaching, servant of God. As long as we kept repeating it we remembered, but when we stopped saying it for a time, a word dropped out, and now it has all gone to pieces. We can remember nothing of it. Teach us again.\\" The bishop is humbled and replies to the hermits, \\"Your own prayer will reach the Lord, men of God. It is not for me to teach you. Pray for us sinners.\\" After this the hermits turn around and walked back to their island. Major themes Tolstoy explores the nature of prayer by contrasting the simple, faithful but unknowing prayer of the illiterate hermits with the formal, doctrinal prayer of the educated bishop who is critical of the hermits' practice. Tolstoy prefaces this story with an epigraph from the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Saint Matthew: \\"And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask Him.\\" St. Matthew vi. 7, 8. The hermits appear to \\"pray without ceasing\\" and their simple one-line prayer a paraphrase of the one-line Jesus Prayer that is popular in the Orthodox faith.

(born 23 June 1954) is a Canadian opera director. He was born in Toronto and is the son of philanthropist Walter Carsen. Early steps towards directing From an early age \\"I became obsessed with the theatre\\" Carsen states and he wanted to become an actor. At Upper Canada College he tells that \\"was in all the plays and musicals I could get into. In those days, because it was a boys‚Äô school, the boys played both male and female roles. So I played Katisha in The Mikado, and Archibald Grosvenor when we did Patience.\\"Margies 2011 Studying theatre at York University in Toronto followed, but by the time he was 20, he abandoned his theatre studies and moved to England to continue studying acting. There he joined the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School for two years and became more interested in directing than acting when: :one of his teachers said he thought Carsen had the makings of a director. \\"At first I thought he was trying to tell me I was a terrible actor, but in fact he was saying, 'I think you‚Äôre actually a director ‚Äî how your mind works, and the way you contribute to what everyone else is doing.' That got me thinking.\\" But Misha Aster notes that: :he had never really entertained the possibility of working in opera until, in 1980, he landed an [unpaid] assistant director‚Äôs job at the Spoleto Festival in Italy [as well as one at the Royal Opera House in London]. This led to a longer-term association with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, a prestigious summer opera festival in Sussex, where Carsen assisted many of the important British and American opera stage directors of the day.Misha Aster, \\"Head and Heart: Director Robert Carsen brings a Canadian temperament to the world‚Äôs great opera houses\\", The Walrus, July/August 2009. p. 1 Career beginnings When Carsen was 25 Canadian Opera Company (COC) director Lotfi Mansouri invited him to work as assistant director on Tristan und Isolde, and this was followed directing two operas at the Guelph Spring Festival in Ontario, these being Peter Maxwell Davies' The Lighthouse and Benjamin Britten‚Äôs The Prodigal Son. Carsen started at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve in 1987 and he stood out as a designer with the National Ballet of Canada. Career highlights Subsequently, Carsen staged Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner in Cologne, Eugene Onegin at the Metropolitan Opera, Il Trovatore in Bregenz, Capriccio by Richard Strauss, Alcina by Handel and Rusalka at the Opera Bastille with Ren√©e Fleming, The Magic Flute in Baden-Baden, La Traviata at La Fenice, Mefistofele at the San Francisco Opera and Der Rosenkavalier at the Salzburg Festival. He directed seven Puccini operas in Belgium and Verdi's Shakespearean trilogy of (Macbeth, Falstaff and Otello) in Germany. In addition, Carsen directed Sunset Boulevard and The Soldier's Tale with Sting, Vanessa Redgrave and Ian McKellen. Recent accomplishments His most recent staging has been of Verdi's Falstaff.

History It is a long low building with walls and low timber beams dated to 1380, with a thatched roof. The inn was used as a tobacco drying shed during the smuggling days. Until 1941 the Blue Anchor belonged to the Fonmon Estate. Bill Coleman became landlord and then passed it on to his son, John. John retired in 1987, passing it on to his two sons, Jeremy and Andrew Coleman who currently run it. The inn caught fire in 1922, 2004, and again in 2009, the last fire burning about 30% of the thatched roof. In 2008, the \\"Great Pubs of Wales\\", presented by John Sparkes, was filmed here. In 2010 a scene from the Hollywood blockbuster Killer Elite starring Robert De Niro, Clive Owen and Jason Statham was also shot here. Architecture The inn is a traditional Welsh thatch roofed, with old stonework and beams which retain a medieval feel. The Good Pub Guide said of \\"It's the appealing warren of little rooms and cosy corners in this character- laden, 600-year-old tavern that provide its appeal. The building has massive walls, low-beamed rooms and tiny doorways, with open fires everywhere, including one in an inglenook with antique oak seats built into its stripped stonework.

Character information Character background John A. Sampson met African-American Alex Cross and at the age of ten they became best friends. When both of Sampson's parents died and/or left him (his father was in prison; his mother was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to sell) he was practically raised by Alex's grandmother, Nana Mama since Alex's parents were both dead, too, which is the reason he moved to Washington, D.C. in the books. They are described as having much fun, stealing, etc. during their childhood in some of the books, which would annoy Nana Mama who would in turn lecture or ground Cross. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army for four years of duty. He had a tour in Vietnam and made friends with his drill sergeant who was later killed in Four Blind Mice and goes looking for the killer along with Alex Cross, who became a Washington police officer. When returning to D.C., he also works for the Metropolitan Police Department with Cross, until Alex joins the FBI. Character overview Eventually, he and Cross join the police force, work for/with the FBI, and Metropolitan Police Department in the newest books. He is the partner of Cross as well; they are cops and detectives. Sampson first appears in the book Along Came a Spider in which he and Cross go on the case to solve a kidnapping of famous actress' daughter. He appears in 19 of the 20 books in the series. He briefly appears in Kiss the Girls (2nd book). He also helps Cross in Jack & Jill when murders are committed near Cross' son Damon's elementary school, Truth. In Pop Goes the Weasel he reveals to Cross that he had been in love with Nina Childs, an African-American nurse, who is killed early in the book, thus he vows to get vengeance. Cross later finds the killer, Geoffrey Shafer, and arrests him. However, Shafer, in court, wins and the case is closed, therefore letting him get the chance to kill his own wife and escaping Cross. He returns in London Bridges (novel) and is killed by Cross, avenging Nina's death for Sampson. In the earlier books, he appears but like in \\"cameos\\", or small roles and gains a larger role throughout the books. In Cross he officially gains a large role helping Cross capture Michael Sullivan \\"The Butcher\\" who may have killed Alex's wife, Maria, years ago. In the end, Sullivan is killed by Alex and Sampson reveals he had killed Maria's murderer, Jimmy Hats Galati (a friend of Sullivan's) long ago, but couldn't find it in himself to tell this to Cross. In Double Cross he helps Cross and his new love interest, Brianna \\"Bree\\" Stone, but at the end is kidnapped. Cross rescues his partner, and with the help of Bree kills and stops the killers known as DCAK. In the books, the main antagonist (for coming out more in the books) is Gary Soneji or Kyle Craig \\"The Mastermind\\". Kyle Craig is a friend of Cross and Sampson in the beginning of the series, but in Roses Are Red he is a murder known as the Mastermind. It is not until the end of Violets Are Blue that he is arrested by Cross himself. In the novel, Four Blind Mice, John meets a woman named Billie, whose husband was framed for murder and killed by lethal injection. While investigating her, John ends up falling in love with her, while at the same time not knowing it. Even after he gets what he needs from her, John keeps seeing her again. After a few dozen times, John and Billie finally admit their love for each other and decide to start a relationship. John, who has never slept with any woman before (which is less likely due to earlier suggestions from the previous novels), sleeps with Billie and finds himself at peace for the very first time with her. He proposes to her and the two get married at the end of the book. In London Bridges, John reveals that Billie is pregnant and that he is going to be a father, which excites him. Billie and his daughter make several appearances throughout the series. Sampson continues to support Alex in I, Alex Cross, where Nana Mama has a heart attack. He is considered family by Cross and his family. Cross Country shows him helping Alex and Bree in a murder committed by children under the supervision of a killer known as the \\"Tiger\\". In Cross Fire he continues to be Cross' bestfriend/partner/helper/sidekick and all. He is also Cross' best man when Cross remarries after the death of his wife, Maria Cross. Appearances in series Note: Sampson has appeared in 20 of the 26 books of the series so far and 2 out of 3 of the Cross films. * Along Came a Spider * Kiss the Girls * Jack & Jill * Cat and Mouse * Pop Goes the Weasel * Roses Are Red * Violets Are Blue * Four Blind Mice * The Big Bad Wolf * London Bridges * Mary, Mary * Cross * Double Cross * Cross Country * I, Alex Cross * Cross Fire * Kill Alex Cross * Merry Christmas, Alex Cross * Alex Cross, Run * Cross My Heart * Hope to Die * Cross Justice * Cross Kill * The People vs. Alex Cross Love interests Throughout the books, it is explained Sampson has had many girlfriends, but has not been able to marry anyone for a few reasons. * In the book, Pop Goes the Weasel, he tells Alex he had fallen in love with the newly deceased Nina Childs, before she had died. Her death causes him great pain and he vows vengeance against the one who killed her. The killer is revealed to be Geoffrey Shafer, who manages to escape at the end of the novel. By London Bridges, Shafer resurfaces and is killed by Alex, avenging Nina's death for John, similar to what John did for Alex in the novel Cross. * In Four Blind Mice, he goes to New Jersey to investigate a woman named Billie, whose husband had previously died. After, what initially was interrogating her, they become friends. After some time, in the book they start dating and share a romantic night together. Sampson mentions that he has never made love to woman before, despite that the past novels say otherwise, and finally gives in with Billie. At the end of the book, Sampson proposes to Billie and the two get married. In London Bridges John reveals to Alex that Billie is pregnant and that he is going to be a father. Billie is once again featured in most of the books afterwards, or is mentioned. Billie reappears with John in Merry Christmas Alex Cross, while on a double date with Alex and Bree. John was initially reluctant to even get close to Billie because his parents had not been the best of parents ‚Äì his father left him; his mom went to jail. Due to this, he did not want to have kids in fear the same that happened to him would happen to his children. He eventually overcomes this fear and allows himself to fall deeply in love with Billie, marry her, and also have a child with her. It is said that Sampson is finally at peace because of her and his new daughter. * In the film Alex Cross, he appears as a main character by the name of Tommy Kane living in Detroit. In the film, he is revealed to be dating a fellow partner, Detective Monica Ashe. After Alex figures out that he has been sleeping with her, they both argue over the rules of having a relationship like that on the job, as it is dangerous to be emotionally compromised. After Monica attempts to help them, she is apprehended by the film's villain, Picasso, who apparently kills her. Cross and Kane go after a chemist in order to find the killer, where it is revealed that Monica died from her injuries. Her death causes Tom to seek vengeance, along with Alex, whose wife was also killed by the same villain. They manage to stop Picasso from escaping, but Tom is injured in the attempt, forcing Alex to face off against him. By the end of the movie, Alex kills Picasso by making him fall to his death, avenging both his wife's and Monica's deaths. : In the book the film was adapted from ‚Äì Cross ‚Äì Monica Ashe doesn't appear or even exist in the novel. Also, Tom's character is actually named John Sampson in the novel series and is already married to his wife, Billie, by the events of Cross. Film adaptations Sampson briefly appeared played by Bill Nunn in the first Alex Cross film ever made ‚Äì Kiss the Girls. In the movie, John is the one who tells Alex (Morgan Freeman) of Naomi's disappearance and is seen helping Alex comfort his family. While he tries to tell Alex to leave Naomi's disappearance to the police in North Carolina, Alex declines and decides to go investigate. Later on, Alex and Sampson team up in Los Angeles, doing a unofficial police stakeout on a suspect named Dr. Rudolph, along with the help of Kate McTiernan and fellow detective, Henry Castillo. They manage to catch Rudolph in the act of raping a young girl and move in to capture him. However, Rudolph escapes and kills Henry, also injuring Alex along the way as well. In order to make sure that Alex and Kate are safe, John takes full responsibility for the incident and is blamed by the authorities for what happened. While he doesn't make any more appearances, his sacrifice is not in vain as Alex manages to catch Rudolph and the real Casanova, also rescuing Naomi and many other captive girls too. In this movie, John Sampson's introduction and appearance is more faithful to the book and series. It is also the only movie that John Sampson is seen in. In the 2012 film Alex Cross, he was portrayed by actor Edward Burns and had a substantial larger role than in Kiss the Girls. However, Sampson's name in the film was changed to \\"Tommy Kane\\". Another notable difference, is that the Alex Cross movie takes place in Detroit, not Washington, D.C. and Kane (Sampson) does not kill Maria Cross' killer, and Michael Sullivan \\"the Butcher\\" is actually Maria's murderer. In the film, Kane and Alex (Tyler Perry) are partners (just like in the novels), along with a new trainee named Monica Ashe. In the film, both Kane and Monica have a relationship, sexually in nature. After Alex discovers the affair, he and Tom talk about how having a relationship like that while being partners is dangerous and Alex gives him the ultimatum to either end the relationship or one of them walks from the unit. Tom later learns that Alex is taking a job with the FBI, due to his wife being pregnant with their third child. While he happy for news of their new baby, Tom also is sadden to the fact that Alex will be moving to Washington D.C., which will force them to go their separate ways. Alex and Tom investigate a recent murder, who they name \\"Picasso\\". After facing off against Picasso and saving his next victim, the killer targets Tom, Alex and Monica for standing up to him. Monica and Alex's wife, Maria, are killed by Picasso, causing them both to go after him for revenge. They manage to find him by using video cameras to discover his licenses plate number and crash into his car as he tries to escape. With Tom injured, Alex goes after Picasso alone and kills him by making him fall to his death, avenging both his wife and Kane's girlfriend. Just as Alex was about to suffer the same fate as Picasso, Kane shows up at the last minute and saves him. After they manage to frame Picasso's employer Giles Mercier, who escaped to Indonesia, by having cocaine put in his house, which he is condemned by firing squad. Having fully avenged Monica's death, Kane decides to join the FBI, so that he could remain close to Alex and maybe work with him again someday. A sequel based on Double Cross is currently in the works. A deal is being finalized by Perry and Patterson. So far it is unconfirmed whether or not if Burns will return to play Kane again, however, Perry has been confirmed to reprise his role as Cross. Sampson's \\"new\\" name ‚Äì Tommy Kane ‚Äì probably reflects an original character that takes character traits and inspiration from Sampson. This has not been confirmed.

His existence is disputed, as is the meaning of the artifacts that have been interpreted as confirming his existence.  Attestations  Horus Sa is known from vessel fragments with black ink inscriptions showing his name. These vessels were found in the east galleries beneath Djoser's pyramid at Saqqara. The inscriptions are short and written in cursive handwritings. In all cases the name \\"Horus Sa\\" does not appear within a serekh and its identification as the Horus-name of a king is disputed.Wolfgang Helck, Die Datierung der Gef√§√üaufschriften aus der Djoserpyramide, in: Zeitschrift f√ºr √§gyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 106, 1979, ISSN 0044-216X, pp. 120‚Äì132. The name \\"Horus Sa\\" always appears within the inscription ·∏§wt-k3 ·∏§rw-z3 (\\"House of the Ka of Horus Sa\\"), regularly found together with the names of Inykhnum and Ma'a-aper-Min, two high-ranking officials who served in the Ka-house. During the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt, the House of the Ka was a forerunner of the mortuary temple, a place where a cult to the Ka of a deceased ruler was performed. A further inscription, ·∏§wt-k3 ·∏§rw-z3, was found in the 1980s at Saqqara in the area of the tomb of Maya and very close to that of Meryra- Meryneith. Maya and Meryra-Meryneith were both late 18th dynasty court officials who reused 2nd dynasty tombs for themselves, some 1,500 years after the death of their original owners.  Identity  J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Dietrich Wildung and Peter Kaplony proposed that \\"Sa\\" is a short form of the Horus-name Sanakht.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen, p. 243. Wolfgang Helck rejects this argument on the grounds that the ink inscriptions from the east-galleries of Djoser's pyramid complex date predominantly from the reign of Nynetjer or shortly thereafter, while Sanakht reigned during the mid-3rd dynasty. Furthermore, inscriptions mentioning the \\"House of the Ka of Hotepsekhemwy\\" are stylistically similar to that of Horus Sa which would place Sa in the 2nd dynasty since Hotepsekhemwy was the first ruler of that dynasty. Thus, Helck proposed that Horus Sa is the Horus-name of another shadowy ruler of the 2nd dynasty, Weneg, whose Horus-name is otherwise unknown.Wolfgang Helck: Untersuchungen zur Thinitenzeit, p. 103 and 108. The Egyptologist Jochem Kahl recently challenged this hypothesis, identifying Weneg with Raneb.Jochem Kahl, Ra is my Lord - Searching for the rise of the Sun God at the dawn of Egyptian history, Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2007, , pp. 12‚Äì14 & 74. Alternatively, Kaplony reconstructed the Horus-name of Weneg from the Cairo fragment of the Palermo stone as Wenegsekhemwy.Peter Kaplony: Steingef√§sse mit Inschriften der Fr√ºhzeit und das Alten Reiches. Monographies Reine Elisabeth, Bruxelles 1968 In both cases, Horus Sa cannot be the Horus-name of Weneg and the two would not designate the same king. Consequently, Kaplony equated Horus Sa with njswt-bity Wr-Za-Khnwm, \\"The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, Wersakhnum\\" and credited him a reign of 2 months and 23 days during the interregnum between Khasekhemwy and Djoser.Peter Kaplony: Die Inschriften der √Ñgyptischen Fr√ºhzeit. O. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 1963, pp. 380, 468 & 611. However, Kaplony's hypothesis has been undermined by the discovery of clay seals of Djoser in Khasekhemwy's tomb, indicating that the former immediately succeeded and buried the latter.Toby Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London 1999, p. 83 & 95 Horus Sa could instead be the Horus-name of Senedj or another 2nd dynasty king, ruling in Memphis during the troubled period following the reign of Nynetjer.Thomas Von der Way: Zur Datierung des \\"Labyrinth-Geb√§udes\\" auf dem Tell el-Fara'in (Buto), in: G√∂ttinger Miszellen 157, 1997, 107-111 However, Egyptologists such as Jean-Philippe Lauer, Pierre Lacau and Ilona Regulski call for caution of the correct reading of the inscriptions. Especially the bird-sign at the top of the Ka-house might also depict a swallow, which would make the inscription to be read as Wer-sa-hut-Ka (\\"great protection of the Ka-house\\"). Regulski prefers the reading as a Horus- bird, though she doesn't explicitly see it as the name of a king. She dates the inscriptions to the end of Khasekhemwy's reign.Ilona Regulski: Second dynasty ink inscriptions from Saqqara paralleled in the Abydos material from the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels. p. 953 - 959.  Tomb  The burial place of Horus Sa is unknown. Nabil Swelim associated Horus Sa with the unfinished enclosure of Gisr el-Mudir in west Saqqara.Nabil Swelim: Some Problems on the History of the Third Dynasty, p. 33 and 181‚àí182. This hypothesis has not gained wide acceptance and the Gisr el-Mudir has been attributed to various second dynasty kings, in particular Khasekhemwy.Ian Mathieson, Elizabeth Bettles, Joanne Clarke, Corinne Duhig, Salima Ikram, Louise Maguire, Sarah Quie, Ana Tavares: The National Museums of Scotland Saqqara Survey Project 1993‚Äì1995. In: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology. 83, 1997, S. 17‚Äì53, hier S.36, 38ff., 53. Alternatively, the Egyptologist Joris van Wetering proposed that the gallery tomb used by the high priest of Aten, Meryra-Meryneith, in north Saqqara was originally that of Horus Sa, since an inscription ·∏§wt-k3 ·∏§rw-z3 was found in the close vicinity of the tomb.Joris van Wetering: The Royal Cemetery of the Early Dynastic Period at Saqqara and the Second Dynasty Royal Tombs, in Proceedings of the Krakow Conference, 2002.Ren√© van Walsem, Sporen van een revolutie in Saqqara.

This followed the Great Western's acquisition of the Monmouthshire Railway whose \\"Eastern Valley\\" line continued southward from Cwmbran Junction alongside the Monmouthshire Canal to Newport. The station was on a line opened by the Great Western in 1878 to connect the Monmouthshire Railway with the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway at Llantarnam Junction. The Pontypool line, which opened in September 1874, had been built to relieve the congested Monmouthshire Railway and was absorbed by the Great Western in December 1874. The line became the primary route for passenger traffic until the Monmouthshire between Pontypool and Newport closed in 1980. The site adjacent to Victoria Street is now a car park and a doctor's surgery. The present Cwmbran railway station was opened in 1986 on the opposite side of the town centre on the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport line, which remains open as part of the Welsh Marches Line.

On the night of 26 September 1960 the aircraft operating the flight, a Vickers Viscount, crashed near Moscow while on its approach to land, killing 31 of the 37 passengers and crew on board. Aircraft The aircraft was a Vickers Viscount 837 four-engined turboprop airliner registered OE-LAF. The aircraft had first flown on 10 February 1960 and had been delivered new to Austrian Airlines about two weeks later, seven months before the crash. Accident The aircraft departed Warsaw with six crew and 31 passengers on board. The flight was on approach to land on runway 07 at Sheremetyevo International Airport in the northern outskirts of Moscow when it crashed in a rural area short of Sheremetyevo's runway near the town of Krukovo.Airliner, 37 aboard, down Investigation The investigation determined that the crew thought that the aircraft was higher than it actually was and that it flew into trees during its approach and crashed. Investigators found that the captain's altimeter (the left-hand altimeter) was adjusted to show a different altitude to the copilot's altimeter. The left altimeter's barometric sub-scale had been set to a pressure that would have resulted in it reading zero feet on the ground at Sheremetyevo. However the sub-scale on the copilot's altimeter was set to a pressure that would have resulted in it reading the airport's height above mean sea level when on the ground at Sheremetyevo. This was against the airline's operating procedures, but the investigation could not determine the reason for the discrepancy.Vickers Viscount 837 OE-LAF accident synopsis retrieved 29 January 2013 Sources Notes Bibliography * External links *Austrian Airlines Flight 901 at Airdisaster.com Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Vickers Viscount Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the Soviet Union Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1960 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Airliner accidents and incidents with an unknown cause Category:1960 in the Soviet Union Category:Austria‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Transport disasters in Moscow Category:September 1960 events ","title":"Austrian Airlines Flight 901"},{"id":"38001473","text":"Asadabad (, also Romanized as AsadƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Galehzan Rural District, in the Central District of Khomeyn County, Markazi Province, Iran.

It is a demand-driven, response-oriented programme that focuses on addressing the needs of developing countries through innovative technological cooperation between India and the partnering nation. Along with its corollary the Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme, ITEC covers 158 countries across Asia, Africa, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, and several Pacific and Caribbean nations. Since its inception, the programme has spent over US$ 2 billion and benefited thousands of students and professionals from around the globe and annual expenditure on the programme has averaged US$ 100 million per annum in recent years.  History  ITEC was officially launched on 15 September 1964 but for decades it remained a marginal programme as India itself was dependent on international aid. ITEC was an important part of India's attempt to contributing to South-South cooperation. India's aid for its neighbours began in the 1950s through assistance to Nepal. However, until the 1990s, India was also the world largest recipient of aid, receiving a cumulative sum of US$ 55 billion since its independence in 1947. The ITEC programme has grown in scope and size since the 2000s as India's economy grew rapidly. With foreign aid it receives accounting for only 0.3% of its GDP, India has now emerged as a net donor of foreign aid. Its National Agricultural Research System under the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, one of the largest in the world, and the Indira Gandhi National Open University have played key roles in facilitating ITEC assistance. South Asia accounts for 70% of the grants dispersed under ITEC. Lines of credit are also offered under ITEC and African nations have been the major beneficiaries under this head.  Scope of ITEC  Assistance under ITEC covers the six areas of training for civil and defence personnel, projects and project related activities such as consultancy services, study tours, donation of equipment, deputation of Indian experts in the partner nation and aid for disaster relief. Personnel training under ITEC covers a wide and varied range of sectors such as banking, IT and computers, personnel management and administrative and scientific areas. ITEC is administered by the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India and all expenses including international airfare, boarding, lodging and tuition fees of selected personnel are borne by the Indian authorities. Although ITEC is essentially a bilateral programme, its resources have also been used for financing trilateral and regional undertakings such as with the Economic Commission for Africa, UNIDO and G-77. In Africa, Afro-Asian Rural Reconstruction Organisation, COMESA, the African Union Commission and G-15 receive training and project support under ITEC.  Augmenting Soft Power  The ITEC programme has significantly augmented India's soft power among developing nations. Indian public sector companies such as Hindustan Machine Tools, Water and Power Consultancy Services (WAPCOS), Rail India Technical and Economic Services (RITES) that were closely associated with the programme have been able to establish themselves and become well known in developing countries where they have gone on to bid independently for various projects. It has also helped foster contacts between Indian entrepreneurs with decision makers in other developing countries. While monetary assistance under ITEC remained limited for a long while owing to India's own impoverished conditions, technical advice and training for foreign personnel, deputing Indian civil servants abroad to help poorer governments with their professional expertise and providing training in India for civil servants from abroad all helped provide for good future relations with recipient countries. Hamid Karzai's education in India for instance is seen as one of the key reasons why Afghanistan has warmed up to India ever since the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001. To commemorate its achievements and to bring together beneficiaries of the programme in the host country, Indian embassies and consulates around the globe celebrate an ITEC Day every year.  An Indian Aid Agency  In 2012, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) set up a Development Partnership Administration (DPA) under its Economic Relations Division to consolidate outgoing aid and to streamline administrative matters related to such aid. The idea for such an aid agency had been mooted previously by Finance Ministers Jaswant Singh and P Chidambaram variously as the India Development Assistance and the India International Development Cooperation Agency.  Global Impact of ITEC  South Asian nations have traditionally been the largest recipients of Indian aid both as part of ITEC and otherwise. Under the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 1,500 crore have been earmarked for developmental assistance to Myanmar, Afghanistan and Bhutan. Bhutan has traditionally been the largest recipient of Indian aid. In Afghanistan and Myanmar, India has focused on building infrastructure such as roads, buildings and hospitals besides providing training to their personnel. In Sri Lanka, Indian assistance has focused on rebuilding that country, especially its Tamil majority areas in the north and east that were the worst affected, by fighting during the Sri Lankan Civil War. An important strategy in utilising development aid has been the Small Development Projects (SDP) scheme which focuses on low cost projects that aim at creating infrastructure and technical capabilities that directly affects local communities and supports their socioeconomic development. ITEC has also been an important component of India's assistance to African nations. In recent years, India has increased its assistance to various African nations and groupings. The focus is now on areas such as transfer of technology and the development of projects like the Pan-African e-Network project that will link African nations with Indian institutions and expertise. India also continues to provide extensive opportunities for human resource development and personnel training in these countries. There is also a special corollary to augment ITEC for African nations called the Special Commonwealth Assistance for Africa Programme (SCAAP).

Public debt $ and %GDP (2010) for selected European countries Government debt of Eurozone, Germany and crisis countries compared to Eurozone GDP The European debt crisis is an ongoing financial crisis that has made it difficult or impossible for some countries in the euro area to repay or re-finance their government debt without the assistance of third parties. The European sovereign debt crisis resulted from the structural problem of the eurozone and a combination of complex factors, including the globalisation of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002‚Äì2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles that have since burst; the 2008‚Äì2012 global recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches used by nations to bail out troubled banking industries and private bondholders, assuming private debt burdens or socialising losses. One narrative describing the causes of the crisis begins with the significant increase in savings available for investment during the 2000‚Äì2007 period when the global pool of fixed-income securities increased from approximately $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2007. This \\"Giant Pool of Money\\" increased as savings from high-growth developing nations entered global capital markets. Investors searching for higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds sought alternatives globally. The temptation offered by such readily available savings overwhelmed the policy and regulatory control mechanisms in country after country, as lenders and borrowers put these savings to use, generating bubble after bubble across the globe. While these bubbles have burst, causing asset prices (e.g., housing and commercial property) to decline, the liabilities owed to global investors remain at full price, generating questions regarding the solvency of governments and their banking systems. How each European country involved in this crisis borrowed and invested the money varies. For example, Ireland's banks lent the money to property developers, generating a massive property bubble. When the bubble burst, Ireland's government and taxpayers assumed private debts. In Greece, the government increased its commitments to public workers in the form of extremely generous wage and pension benefits, with the former doubling in real terms over 10 years. Iceland's banking system grew enormously, creating debts to global investors (external debts) several times GDP. The interconnection in the global financial system means that if one nation defaults on its sovereign debt or enters into recession putting some of the external private debt at risk, the banking systems of creditor nations face losses. For example, in October 2011, Italian borrowers owed French banks $366 billion (net). Should Italy be unable to finance itself, the French banking system and economy could come under significant pressure, which in turn would affect France's creditors and so on. This is referred to as financial contagion. Another factor contributing to interconnection is the concept of debt protection. Institutions entered into contracts called credit default swaps (CDS) that result in payment should default occur on a particular debt instrument (including government issued bonds). But, since multiple CDSs can be purchased on the same security, it is unclear what exposure each country's banking system now has to CDS. Greece, Italy and other countries tried to artificially reduce their budget deficits deceiving EU officials with the help of derivatives designed by major banks. Although some financial institutions clearly profited in the short run, there was a long lead-up to the crisis. Rising household and government debt levels Public debt as a per cent of GDP (2010) In 1992, members of the European Union signed the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. However, a number of EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules, failing to abide by their own internal guidelines, sidestepping best practice and ignoring internationally agreed standards.How Europe's governments have enronized their debts This allowed the sovereigns to mask their deficit and debt levels through a combination of techniques, including inconsistent accounting, off- balance-sheet transactions as well as the use of complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The complex structures were designed by prominent U.S. investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services. The adoption of the euro led to many Eurozone countries of different credit worthiness receiving similar and very low interest rates for their bonds and private credits during years preceding the crisis, which author Michael Lewis referred to as \\"a sort of implicit Germany guarantee.\\" As a result, creditors in countries with originally weak currencies (and higher interest rates) suddenly enjoyed much more favorable credit terms, which spurred private and government spending and led to an economic boom. In some countries, such as Ireland and Spain, low interest rates also led to a housing bubble, which burst at the height of the financial crisis.\\"16 Wege aus der Krise ‚Äì Sorge um Deutschland und Europa\\" \\"Bogenberger Erkl√§rung\\" von Experten um den Pr√§sidenten des Ifo-Instituts, Hans-Werner Sinn, FAZ Online 6. Dezember 2011Sachverst√§ndigenrat, \\"Verantwortung f√ºr Europa wahrnehmen\\", S. 69. Commentators such as Bernard Connolly highlighted this as the fundamental problem of the euro. A number of economists have dismissed the popular belief that the debt crisis was caused by excessive social welfare spending. According to their analysis, increased debt levels were mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the late-2000s financial crisis, and the global economic slowdown thereafter. The average fiscal deficit in the euro area in 2007 was only 0.6% before it grew to 7% during the financial crisis. In the same period, the average government debt rose from 66% to 84% of GDP. The authors also stressed that fiscal deficits in the euro area were stable or even shrinking since the early 1990s., see English version manifesto US economist Paul Krugman named Greece as the only country where fiscal irresponsibility is at the heart of the crisis. British economic historian Robert Skidelsky added that it was indeed excessive lending by banks, not deficit spending that created this crisis. Government's mounting debts are a response to the economic downturn as spending rises and tax revenues fall, not its cause. Government deficit of Eurozone compared to USA and UK Either way, high debt levels alone may not explain the crisis. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit, the position of the euro area looked \\"no worse and in some respects, rather better than that of the US or the UK.\\" The budget deficit for the euro area as a whole (see graph) is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the US. Moreover, private-sector indebtedness across the euro area is markedly lower than in the highly leveraged Anglo-Saxon economies. Trade imbalances Current account balances relative to GDP (2010) Commentator and Financial Times journalist Martin Wolf has asserted that the root of the crisis was growing trade imbalances. He notes in the run- up to the crisis, from 1999 to 2007, Germany had a considerably better public debt and fiscal deficit relative to GDP than the most affected eurozone members. In the same period, these countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain) had far worse balance of payments positions. Whereas German trade surpluses increased as a percentage of GDP after 1999, the deficits of Italy, France and Spain all worsened. Paul Krugman wrote in 2009 that a trade deficit by definition requires a corresponding inflow of capital to fund it, which can drive down interest rates and stimulate the creation of bubbles: \\"For a while, the inrush of capital created the illusion of wealth in these countries, just as it did for American homeowners: asset prices were rising, currencies were strong, and everything looked fine. But bubbles always burst sooner or later, and yesterday‚Äôs miracle economies have become today‚Äôs basket cases, nations whose assets have evaporated but whose debts remain all too real.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-Revenge of the Glut-March 2009 A trade deficit can also be affected by changes in relative labour costs, which made southern nations less competitive and increased trade imbalances. Since 2001, Italy's unit labour costs rose 32 % relative to Germany's. Greek unit labour costs rose much faster than Germany's during the last decade. However, most EU nations had increases in labour costs greater than Germany's. Those nations that allowed \\"wages to grow faster than productivity\\" lost competitiveness. Germany's restrained labour costs, while a debatable factor in trade imbalances, are an important factor for its low unemployment rate. More recently, Greece's trading position has improved; in the period 2011 to 2012, imports dropped 20.9% while exports grew 16.9%, reducing the trade deficit by 42.8%. Simon Johnson explains the hope for convergence in the Eurozone and what went wrong. The euro locks countries into an exchange rate amounting to \\"very big bet that their economies would converge in productivity.\\" If not, workers would move to countries with greater productivity. Instead the opposite happened: the gap between German and Greek productivity increased, resulting in a large current account surplus financed by capital flows. The capital flows could have been invested to increase productivity in the peripheral nations. Instead capital flows were squandered in consumption and consumptive investments. Further, Eurozone countries with sustained trade surpluses (i.e., Germany) do not see their currency appreciate relative to the other Eurozone nations due to a common currency, keeping their exports artificially cheap. Germany's trade surplus within the Eurozone declined in 2011 as its trading partners were less able to find financing necessary to fund their trade deficits, but Germany's trade surplus outside the Eurozone has soared as the euro declined in value relative to the dollar and other currencies.NYT-Outside Europe, German Trade Surplus Soars-May 2012 Economic evidence indicates the crisis may have more to do with trade deficits (which require private borrowing to fund) than public debt levels. Economist Paul Krugman wrote in March 2013: \\"...the really strong relationship within the [eurozone countries] is between interest spreads and current account deficits, which is in line with the conclusion many of us have reached, that the euro area crisis is really a balance of payments crisis, not a debt crisis.\\"NYT-Paul Krugman-Fatal Fiscal Attractions-8 March 2013 A February 2013 paper from four economists concluded that, \\"Countries with debt above 80 % of GDP and persistent current-account [trade] deficits are vulnerable to a rapid fiscal deterioration...\\"NYT-Binyamin Appelbaum- Predicting a Crisis, Repeatedly-22 February 2013The Atlantic-No, the United States Will Never, Ever Turn Into Greece-Mathew O'Brien-7 March 2013 Structural problem of Eurozone system One theory is that these problems are caused by a structural contradiction within the euro system, the theory is that there is a monetary union (common currency) without a fiscal union (e.g., common taxation, pension, and treasury functions). In the Eurozone system, the countries are required to follow a similar fiscal path, but they do not have common treasury to enforce it. That is, countries with the same monetary system have freedom in fiscal policies in taxation and expenditure. So, even though there are some agreements on monetary policy and through the European Central Bank, countries may not be able to or would simply choose not to follow it. This feature brought fiscal free riding of peripheral economies, especially represented by Greece, as it is hard to control and regulate national financial institutions. Furthermore, there is also a problem that the Eurozone system has a difficult structure for quick response. Eurozone, having 18 nations as its members, require unanimous agreement for a decision making process. This would lead to failure in complete prevention of contagion of other areas, as it would be hard for the Eurozone to respond quickly to the problem. In addition, as of June 2012 there was no \\"banking union\\" meaning that there was no Europe-wide approach to bank deposit insurance, bank oversight, or a joint means of recapitalisation or resolution (wind-down) of failing banks. Bank deposit insurance helps avoid bank runs. Recapitalisation refers to injecting money into banks so that they can meet their immediate obligations and resume lending, as was done in 2008 in the U.S. via the Troubled Asset Relief Programme. Columnist Thomas L. Friedman wrote in June 2012: \\"In Europe, hyperconnectedness both exposed just how uncompetitive some of their economies were, but also how interdependent they had become. It was a deadly combination. When countries with such different cultures become this interconnected and interdependent ‚Äì when they share the same currency but not the same work ethics, retirement ages or budget discipline ‚Äì you end up with German savers seething at Greek workers, and vice versa.\\"NYT-Thomas Friedman- Two Worlds Cracking Up-12 June 2012 Monetary policy inflexibility Membership in the Eurozone established a single monetary policy, preventing individual member states from acting independently. In particular they cannot create Euros in order to pay creditors and eliminate their risk of default. Since they share the same currency as their (eurozone) trading partners, they cannot devalue their currency to make their exports cheaper, which in principle would lead to an improved balance of trade, increased GDP and higher tax revenues in nominal terms. In the reverse direction moreover, assets held in a currency which has devalued suffer losses on the part of those holding them. For example, by the end of 2011, following a 25 % fall in the rate of exchange and 5 % rise in inflation, eurozone investors in Pound sterling, locked into euro exchange rates, had suffered an approximate 30 % cut in the repayment value of this debt. Loss of confidence CDS prices of selected European countries (2010‚Äì2015). The left axis is in basis points; a level of 1,000 means it costs $1 million to protect $10 million of debt for five years. Prior to development of the crisis it was assumed by both regulators and banks that sovereign debt from the eurozone was safe. Banks had substantial holdings of bonds from weaker economies such as Greece which offered a small premium and seemingly were equally sound. As the crisis developed it became obvious that Greek, and possibly other countries', bonds offered substantially more risk. Contributing to lack of information about the risk of European sovereign debt was conflict of interest by banks that were earning substantial sums underwriting the bonds. The loss of confidence is marked by rising sovereign CDS prices, indicating market expectations about countries' creditworthiness (see graph). Furthermore, investors have doubts about the possibilities of policy makers to quickly contain the crisis. Since countries that use the euro as their currency have fewer monetary policy choices (e.g., they cannot print money in their own currencies to pay debt holders), certain solutions require multi-national cooperation. Further, the European Central Bank has an inflation control mandate but not an employment mandate, as opposed to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate. According to The Economist, the crisis \\"is as much political as economic\\" and the result of the fact that the euro area is not supported by the institutional paraphernalia (and mutual bonds of solidarity) of a state. Heavy bank withdrawals have occurred in weaker Eurozone states such as Greece and Spain. Bank deposits in the Eurozone are insured, but by agencies of each member government. If banks fail, it is unlikely the government will be able to fully and promptly honour their commitment, at least not in euros, and there is the possibility that they might abandon the euro and revert to a national currency; thus, euro deposits are safer in Dutch, German, or Austrian banks than they are in Greece or Spain. As of June 2012, many European banking systems were under significant stress, particularly Spain. A series of \\"capital calls\\" or notices that banks required capital contributed to a freeze in funding markets and interbank lending, as investors worried that banks might be hiding losses or were losing trust in one another.NYT-Worried Banks Resist Fiscal Union-17 June 2012 In June 2012, as the euro hit new lows, there were reports that the wealthy were moving assets out of the Eurozone and within the Eurozone from the South to the North. Between June 2011 and June 2012 Spain and Italy alone have lost 286 bn and 235 bn euros. Altogether Mediterranean countries have lost assets worth ten per cent of GDP since capital flight started in end of 2010. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, has called for an integrated European system of deposit insurance which would require European political institutions craft effective solutions for problems beyond the limits of the power of the European Central Bank. As of 6 June 2012, closer integration of European banking appeared to be under consideration by political leaders. Household's risk aversion Portfolio data and repeated surveys of an Italian bank's clients have shown that investors' risk aversion increased following the 2008 crisis. This substantial risk aversion increase affected individuals to divest more stock. From a macroeconomic perspective, risk aversion was an important mechanism underlying financial decisions, output, and real money balance dynamics during the European debt crisis. Interest on long term sovereign debt In June 2012, following negotiation of the Spanish bailout line of credit interest on long-term Spanish and Italian debt continued to rise rapidly, casting doubt on the efficacy of bailout packages as anything more than a stopgap measure. The Spanish rate, over 6% before the line of credit was approved, approached 7%, a rough rule of thumb indicator of serious trouble. Rating agency views On 5 December 2011, S&P; placed its long-term sovereign ratings on 15 members of the eurozone on \\"CreditWatch\\" with negative implications; S&P; wrote this was due to \\"systemic stresses from five interrelated factors: 1) Tightening credit conditions across the eurozone; 2) Markedly higher risk premiums on a growing number of eurozone sovereigns including some that are currently rated 'AAA'; 3) Continuing disagreements among European policy makers on how to tackle the immediate market confidence crisis and, longer term, how to ensure greater economic, financial, and fiscal convergence among eurozone members; 4) High levels of government and household indebtedness across a large area of the eurozone; and 5) The rising risk of economic recession in the eurozone as a whole in 2012. Currently, we expect output to decline next year in countries such as Spain, Portugal and Greece, but we now assign a 40% probability of a fall in output for the eurozone as a whole.\\" See also * 2000s commodities boom * 2007‚Äì2012 global financial crisis * 2008‚Äì2012 Icelandic financial crisis * 2008‚Äì2012 global recession * Crisis situations and protests in Europe since 2000 * European sovereign-debt crisis: List of acronyms * European sovereign-debt crisis: List of protagonists * Federal Reserve Economic Data * Late-2000s recession in Europe * List of countries by credit rating References External links * The Impact of the Eurozone Crisis on the European Integration Process A documentary by the Institut d'Etudes Europ√©ennes of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles * The Impact of the Eurozone Crisis on European Socio-economic governance A documentary by the Institut d'Etudes Europ√©ennes of the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles *The EU Crisis Pocket Guide by the Transnational Institute in English (2012) ‚Äì Italian (2012) ‚Äì Spanish (2011) *2011 Dahrendorf Symposium ‚Äì Changing the Debate on Europe ‚Äì Moving Beyond Conventional Wisdoms *2011 Dahrendorf Symposium Blog *Eurostat ‚Äì Statistics Explained: Structure of government debt (October 2011 data) *Interactive Map of the Debt Crisis Economist Magazine, 9 February 2011 *European Debt Crisis New York Times topic page updated daily. *Tracking Europe's Debt Crisis New York Times topic page, with latest headline by country (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain). *Map of European Debts New York Times 20 December 2010 *Budget deficit from 2007 to 2015 Economist Intelligence Unit 30 March 2011 *Protests in Greece in Response to Severe Austerity Measures in EU, IMF Bailout ‚Äì video report by Democracy Now! *Diagram of Interlocking Debt Positions of European Countries New York Times 1 May 2010 *Argentina: Life After Default Sand and Colours 2 August 2010 *Google ‚Äì public data: Government Debt in Europe *Stefan Collignon: Democratic requirements for a European Economic Government Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, December 2010 (PDF 625 KB) *Nick Malkoutzis: Greece ‚Äì A Year in Crisis Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Juni 2011 *Rainer Lenz: Crisis in the Eurozone Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, Juni 2011 *Wolf, Martin, \\"Creditors can huff but they need debtors\\", Financial Times, 1 November 2011 7:28 pm. *More Pain, No Gain for Greece: Is the Euro Worth the Costs of Pro-Cyclical Fiscal Policy and Internal Devaluation?

Russell created it intending to be offensive. This caused casting problems, so he decided to cast an adult with dwarfism instead of a young child for the lead role. Russell thus cast Rusty Goffe, who played an Oompa-Loompa in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, to play the lead role of Lenny, an American Jewish boy who aims to inspire a change of heart in Hitler. The film premiered on the website Comedybox.tv on 1 July 2007. Plot In the winter of 1941, a Jewish woman and her young son, Lenny, are watching a newsreel at a Brooklyn movie theater. A reel featuring Adolf Hitler appears on screen, sparking loud disapproval from the audience. Lenny asks his mother why no one likes Hitler, and his mother explains Hitler's atrocities. Lenny wonders aloud what Santa Claus will give him for Christmas, but his mother replies Hitler won't get anything for Christmas. This prompts Lenny to travel alone to Germany to give Hitler a kitten for Christmas, hoping it will soften Hitler's heart and make him reconsider his actions. Upon Lenny's arrival, he presents the boxed gift to Hitler, who fears it's a bomb, and tosses it to his mistress, Eva Braun. She opens it to discover a kitten, which she gives to Hitler, who is moved to tears. As Hitler embraces his gift, his mood changes when Lenny reveals he has a swastika-shaped birthmark on his stomach, and Hitler notices his star of David necklace. Horrified and infuriated, Hitler has Eva slaughter Lenny, and skin the boy's corpse to fashion a lampshade made of his hide, which they display on their bedside table lamp, using Lenny's necklace as a switch. Following the war, the lamp is returned to the Lenny's mother, who keeps it as part of a shrine honoring Lenny. When her hand makes contact with the surface of the shade, the lamp lights up, and by what appears to be an act of God, the swastika transforms into a Star of David. She proclaims this to be a miracle of God, and soon, she, holding the lamp, stands before president Harry S. Truman, who awards the Purple Heart to the lampshade. Cast *Rusty Goffe as Lenny, a young Jewish boy living in Brooklyn, New York City *Phil Pritchard as Adolf Hitler *Rosey Thewlis as Eva Braun, Hitler's mistress *Lisi Tribble as Lenny's mother *Rufus Graham as United States president Harry S. Truman Production Following a discussion about film censorship with British broadcaster Melvyn Bragg while they worked on The South Bank Show, Bragg challenged Russell to create a film which Russell himself would want banned. The result was A Kitten for Hitler. After Russell sent Bragg an initial draft, Bragg responded, \\"Ken, if ever you make this film and it is shown, you will be lynched.\\" Phil Pritchard portrayed Adolf Hitler. Those auditioning for the part were asked to attend the casting dressed as Hitler, creating a bizarre waiting room scene. Due to the content of the film, Russell couldn't convince any child actor's parents to let their son appear in the film. Russell decided to fill the role of Lenny with an adult with dwarfism. He thus cast Rusty Goffe, who played an Oompa-Loompa in the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.Ken & Rusty - flickr.com - Phil Pritchard (actor) Russell's wife Lisi played Lenny's mother, and his daughter organized the costumes. He shot the entire film in a studio in Shoreditch against a green screen with backgrounds added during post-production. The film premiered on the website Comedybox.tv, after Russell was introduced to Dan Schreiber by screenwriter Emma Millions. Reception Ken Russell later described A Kitten for Hitler as his most bizarre and shocking, even more so than his banned 1971 work The Devils, although he also described it as a comedy. Russell told the story of the film to fellow director Quentin Tarantino at a film festival, who reacted favourably. In 2012, it was included in a list of six alternative Christmas films by British newspaper The Guardian.

Ethnic conflicts in Kenya occur frequently, although most are minor skirmishes. A significant increase in the severity of such conflicts between the various ethnic groups inhabiting the country was witnessed after the introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s, especially during the 2007‚Äì08 Kenyan crisis. Major conflicts have also led to exoduses of ethnic minority communities with roots in other geographical areas. Factors Several factors have been identified as the source of outbreaks of communal violence among populations living in close proximity to each other. These include: *Colonial Policies *Political Instigation *Availability of Land *Access to water and pasture resources *Loss of traditional grazing land *Cattle raiding in Kenya *Lack of alternative sources of livelihood *Fears of terrorism *Harassment *Theft and extortion Nationwide conflict The most significant conflict witnessed since Kenya's independence from Britain was the 2007‚Äì08 Kenyan crisis, a series of inter-ethnic clashes ignited by the 2007 disputed presidential elections. By the beginning of 2008, an estimated one third of the 2,200 member Indian community in Kisumu, which controlled most of the city's trade, had begun repatriating back home in the wake of the ethnic clashes. According to community representative Yogesh Dawda, the resident Indians did not trust the Kenyan police's ability to ensure their security. Major regional conflict Rift Valley Province In 1992, 5,000 people were killed and another 75,000 displaced in the Rift Valley Province, with the town of Molo being an epicenter of the violence. The conflict was primarily between the Kalenjin and Kikuyu communities with Land ownership cited as one of key reasons for the conflict. In 2012, clashes over cattle between the ethnic groups in Samburu District resulted in the deaths of over 40 people including police officers sent to quell the violence. In March 2017, 13 people were killed and four wounded in Baringo County during a series of cattle rustling. Western Province The year 2005 witnessed an insurgency in the Mount Elgon District of the Western province of Kenya. This was led by the Sabaot Land Defence Force which drew its members from the Sabaot people, who are a sub-tribe of the Kalenjin. Coast Province 1997 saw a spate of clashes in the Likoni division of Mombasa District. In 2012‚Äì2013, there was ethnic violence among the Orma and Pokomo group in the Tana River District who have historically fought over grazing, farmland and water. Major transregional conflict On 18 November 2012, 10 people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosive ripped apart a route 28 mass transit mini- bus (matatu) in Eastleigh. The explosion was believed to have been an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort. Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensued. Somalis defended their property, and interpreted the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community. On 20 November 2012, Kenya Defence Forces swooped Garissa in a military operation. KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters, killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents were also receiving treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by Farah Maalim accused Kenyan officers of fomenting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if the perpetrators were not brought to justice. Maalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval, and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2billion in missed revenue. Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation. However, general harassment of the Somali community by Kenyan policemen continued, with some officers going as far as invading the homes of Somali businesspeople to steal precious jewellery, foreign currencies, and electronic devices, including expensive phones, laptops and other personal accessories. By January 2013, a mass exodus of Somali residents was reported. Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their Eastleigh bank accounts, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia. The collective departures most affected Eastleigh's real estate sector, as landlords struggled to find Kenyans able to afford the high rates of the apartments and shops vacated by the Somalis.

Jones was a popular novelist (particularly of the American West and the American South) and a well-connected literary editor and political journalist in the two decades leading up to the American Civil War. During the war, he served in the Confederate War Department, and is today, above all, remembered for his published diary from the war period. Antebellum life Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Jones spent his childhood in Kentucky and Missouri. He settled in Arrow Rock, Missouri in 1835 as a storekeeper. Jones left Arrow Rock about the same time he was married, in 1840. The following year, he became editor of the Baltimore Sunday Visitor. His first novel, Wild Western Scenes, was serialized in the Visitor. Jones became editor of the pro-Tyler the Madisonian, later being rewarded for his efforts with the U.S. consulship at Naples. In 1857 he founded and edited the proslavery paper the Southern Monitor, in Philadelphia. After the outbreak of the American Civil War, he abandoned the paper, left his family behind, and fled to Montgomery, Alabama.Cates 1999, pp. 399-440.Eicher 1997, p. 58. Civil War In Montgomery, Jones was employed as a high-ranking government clerk in the Confederate States War Department. When the Confederate government moved to Richmond, Virginia, his family joined him. From the first day of his flight from the North, Jones kept a diary, with the expressed objective of preserving the details of these eventful times for future publication. After the war, Jones and family returned to his farm at Burlington, New Jersey, and prepared his manuscript for publication. In 1866, the year of his death, it was published as A Rebel War Clerk‚Äôs Diary at the Confederate States Capital, although he would never see it in print. The published diary is one of the best sources of everyday life in Richmond during the war; also with details concerning the inner workings of the War Department.Pierpauli 2013, p. 1038. James I. Robertson, Jr. has called him \\"The Civil War's Most Valuable Diarist.\\"\\"The Civil War's Most Valuable Diarist.\\" Virginia Museum of History & Culture. Retrieved 2019-02-10. Literary activities Jones's fiction and activities as an editor attracted the attention of other literary notables of the period, including Edgar Allan Poe and William Gilmore Simms. Jones' early novels, Wild Western Scenes: A Narrative of Adventures in the Western Wilderness, Forty Years Ago (1841), The Western Merchant: A Narrative . . . (1849), and Life and Adventures of a Country Merchant: A Narrative of His Exploits at Home, during His Travels, and in the Cities; Designed to Amuse and Instruct (1854), capture the picturesque and generally Edenic qualities of the West, where he spent his early years. Jones' novels commend the honesty of \\"the People\\" and predict their abiding success, based on the democratic republicanism of Thomas JeffersonLapides 1970, passim.Bradford 1925, passim. In popular culture Jones appears as a humorous supporting character in Harry Turtledove's The Guns of the South, a science fiction novel set in the 1860s.

Nearby localities include Saidnaya and Rankous to the southwest, Yabroud and Maaloula to the northeast, and Assal al-Ward to the northwest. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics, Jubb'adin had a population of 3,778 in the 2004 census.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Rif Dimashq Governorate. However, that number has likely decreased during the Syrian Civil War as a result of combat casualties and emigration of young men out of the village to avoid military drafting. In 2013, the village was bombarded multiple times by the Syrian Armed Forces. The village is among the three last remaining villages where Western Neo-Aramaic is still spoken. Most of the younger people in the village are bilingual and speak both Western Neo-Aramaic and Syrian Arabic fluently. The etymology of the village's name remains controversial. It is believed to be composed of two parts. The first part is ƒ†uppa (), which is Aramaic for 'well' and second part is “Å≈ç·∏è (), which has several possible meanings. “Å≈ç·∏è () could mean 'feast', making the full meaning as 'the well of the feast'. Another possibility is that it is a reference to Audis who founded Audianism prior to the advent of Islam, in which case the full meaning would be 'the well of Audius'. Another theory, though less likely, is that the word is a reference to the people of ‚ÄòAd, who are mentioned in the Quran. Today, the village's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims. The main mosque in the village is called Jem“Åa rƒÅb or 'The large mosque' in Aramaic. Historically, most of the inhabitants were farmers but nowadays there is a much larger diversity of occupations. Jubb'adin is main source for modern poetry written in the Western Neo-Aramaic language thanks to its many poets. The environment is colder than most other Syrian cities and villages due to its altitude. Famous individuals from the village include the Syrian actor Jalal Al-Taweel.

The pub was established in 1977 from a row of three sea houses. Notable smuggling operations and dove culling once took place here and a tunnel connected the sea to what was known as Sully House. It takes its name from the wife of a sea captain who lived here and buried her in a nearby wood rather than confessing to her dying aboard his ship. The body of the wife was originally kept in a box that was mistaken for treasure and stolen. Today the Spinney Park Holiday and Leisure Park surrounds the pub. Parking In 2002 the owners of the pub caused controversy by placing parking charges for people coming to the pub and beach. By January 2003, the scheme had been dropped. Local councillor Anthony Ernest said, \\"I am extremely pleased that the owners have now realised that their decision, while perhaps 'commercial' in its approach, in fact did little more than cause an upset to the many people who over many years have visited Swanbridge to enjoy the views, and take a little refreshment at the same time. I took a number of steps to encourage the proprietors to scrap the charges, which had local people up in arms. I am pleased that they have now reflected on that decision and decided that the hassle caused was not worth the effort, let alone the loss of business.\\" Haunting The pub is reputedly haunted by the ghost of the Captain's wife, who often appears as a dark shadow and disoriented. Another female spirit is said to walk through the bar doors and walk the length of the lounge before disappearing into the fruit machine. A male ghost of a man with windswept hair who died about the age of 40 is said to roam the bar area. A ghost of a young boy aged 4‚Äì5 is often heard in one of the upstairs bedrooms, and another young boy has been seen regularly near the chimney in the bar area; it is believed he was trying to escape from his violent father and died there.  Controversy  On 26 November 2019 the pub was criticised for blocking an historic dovecot which is attached to the premises. Campaigners claimed that as well as displacing several nesting birds, a number were also trapped within the dovecot. On 27 November 2019 a statement was issued by the pub's owners, Vintage Inns, a subsidiary of Mitchells & Butlers, which said: > \\"Following internal consultations and a review of our original decision we > will be reopening the dovecote today. We will be making contact with a local > bird rescue group so we can work with them to resolve the situation.Our > original decision to block the dovecote was made on the grounds of health > and safety and hygiene, because of the large amount of pigeons and total > number of other birds using the dovecote which was creating a seriously > unhygienic environment. Please be assured in this process it was our > intention and priority that no birds were harmed in the blocking of the > dovecote.\\" Update 31 January 2020 closed the Dovecot again: > Due to ongoing hygiene issues associated with the high number of doves and > pigeons that are attracted to the dovecote at the Captain's Wife, we have > had to take the difficult decision to close off the existing dovecote.

It starred Italian comedian Tot√≤ and famed actor Orson Welles. The film was originally shot in Gevacolor, but only black-and-white prints exist today. Sergio Leone and Lucio Fulci were both assistant directors on this film. Fulci said the film did not really do well, but it gave Fulci his first screenwriting credit, and he really enjoyed being in Orson Welles' presence. Welles was in Italy filming Othello at the time, and Fulci said Welles' entire diet consisted of oranges which he ate in massive quantities. Fulci described Tot√≤ as being a very sad figure, and said Carlo Ponti forced him to star in this film against his will, as Toto had signed a contract with the producer. Although filming went past the contracted period, Ponti never paid Orson Welles a penny in overtime either.Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 24. The film was based on the 1919 novel and play of the same name by Luigi Pirandello. Pirandello's heirs were very disappointed with the film, which they said omitted most of the bawdy humor and the theme of dressing the actors up in animal costumes was jettisoned by the producers, leaving behind an emasculated version of Pirandello's play. To make matters worse, the film vanished from sight for decades following its brief theatrical release, a black-and-white print only surfacing in the early 1990s, making it impossible to evaluate Mario Damicelli's much vaunted color cinematography.Howarth, Troy (2015). Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films. Midnight Marquee Press. page 24.  Plot  Paolino (Tot√≤) is in love with a married woman, Annarella (Viviane Romance). Both participate in a casual affair, but one day Annarella becomes pregnant. The woman's husband, Captain Perella (Orson Welles), suddenly returns after months away from home for work. In order to avoid the shame and disgrace of discovery, Paolino hatches a complex plot to ensure that Perella spends a night of pleasure with Annarella to disguise the origin of her pregnancy. Little do they know the Captain is recovering from a series of trysts with multiple mistresses while on his sea voyage. Paolino dresses Annarella in sexy attire to pique her husband's interest, and even tries to get him to eat some cake laced with stimulants.

Imprisoned after the Abrilada, he became one of the most uncompromising defenders of the Charter, remaining in exile for several years after 1828, and only returning in 1834 to defend his legislative agenda, exiling himself once again in 1836. In the final ten years of his life, Mouzinho da Silveira retired from public life, before his untimely death. Early life Mouzinho da Silveira was born on 12 July 1780, in Castelo de Vide, son of a wealthy rural property-owner. After learning arithmetic, Latin and Greek, he departed for Porto in October 1796, where he remained until June of the following year, taking preparatory classes for Law classes (which he registered for in October 1797). He completed his studies on 19 July 1802. Following the death of his father, in May 1799, he assumed the head of the household, obtaining financial independence. Mouzinho maintained, ever the frugal man, copious registers of his receipts and personal expenses, including them later in his autobiography. He returned to Castelo de Vide where, between 1803 and 1804, he occupied his time with tasks associated with the family estate, especially after the death of his maternal grandmother. At the end of 1804, he left for Lisbon where spent his time at the royal court until 1807, an obligation of his family‚Äôs position. He was present in Lisbon at the arrival of French troops, under the command of Junot (in November 1807), during the first French Invasion of Portugal. Career An early caricature of Mouzinho da Silveira Completing the obligations that brought him to Lisbon, Mouzinho da Silveira opted not to return to Castelo de Vide and join the magisterium (the legal body of Portuguese magistrates). He took office on 1 March 1809, as a juiz de fora (itinerant judge) for Marv√£o, a place where he had lived for three years previous (preparing the defenses during the Napoleonic invasion). At the end of his mandate, he returned to Lisbon (on 15 October 1812), before once again heading out, this time for Castelo Branco, where he occupied the post from 29 May 1813 to 22 November 1816. Returning to Lisbon, Mouzinho was named Provedor of the comarca for Portalegre, arriving on 21 January 1817, taking-up his position on 5 March and occupying the post until 2 January 1821. Liberal Revolution Following the Liberal Revolution of 1820, Mouzinho da Silveira ran in the elections, although he was unsuccessful in obtaining a posting in the Chamber of Deputies. In February 1821, he was entrusted with the collections for the Ministry of Finance in Estremoz, in addition to visiting the comarcas of √âvora and Ourique, which he was unable to complete, being dispatched on 11 April to the Alf√¢ndega Grande do A√ß√∫car (Great Sugar Customshouse) in Lisbon, where he began exercising his role on 15 May. From this position he was named Minister for Finances on 28 May 1823. Surviving the expulsions of the Vilafrancada, Mouzinho was confirmed as Minister by decree on 31 May, but immediately fired by decree on 19 June 1823. Referring to this nomination, Mouzinho wrote: \\"Being administrator of the customs house, I was obligated, against my will, to be Minister of Finance on 29 May 1823, and surviving the reestablishment of the absolute monarchy, I was fired on the 15th and returned to my job in the customshouse, retaining my honors as Minister\\"Mouzinho da Silveira (Obras, Volume I), p. 302 In this short passage through the corridors of government, Mouzinho was able to promulgate the decree of 12 June 1823, revoking the taxes and 10% special fees, which were established by law in March 1823. During the Abrilada, Mouzinho was arrested (30 April 1824), and imprisoned in the Monastery of Batalha, where he remained until 14 May, when he was liberated, along with other political prisoners. By decree, on 8 August 1825, Mouzinho was elevated to the honors of Noble Knight of the Royal Household (). He continued to occupy positions of fiscal oversight; he was named on 12 November 1825 to the Board responsible for elaborating a general customs authority for Lisbon, and began working on the boards responsible for the revision of the 1810 treaty with the United Kingdom, and in 1825, with Brazil. In the elections of October 1826, he was elected deputy for the Alentejo, becoming part of the commission for finances, in the Chamber of Deputies, centering his parliamentary activities on material associated with taxation and management of the national heritage. Liberal Wars A later, statesman-like, portrait of Mouzinho da Silveira Feeling the need to go into exile with the ascendancy of King Miguel, in March 1828, he requested a years sabbatical to travel, and left Lisbon on 3 April 1828, arriving in Paris on 15 April. He remained in Paris until 1832, developing studies on taxation, while maintaining an intense letter-writing exchange with friends and family in Portugal. During this period, his patrimonial situation deteriorated significantly, reflecting his absence from Portugal and economic crisis of the country at the time. With his wife and child in Paris, Mouzinho attempted to reinforce his son‚Äôs education, that included languages (including German), chemistry and other sciences, which were not available in Portugal. Mouzinho also attempted to force his son into copperage, which Mouzinho had already established, but had never attained the level of income that he once had. On 7 February 1831, he joined the consultative commission that substituted the Council of State, during the Regency, in the name of Queen Maria II of Portugal. On 6 June, he was also asked to join the Chamber of Deputies' Finance Commission, the council responsible for collecting funds and loans necessary to subsidize the Liberal cause. =Azores= While in Paris, he was invited to accompany Peter IV during his campaign to return Portugal to a liberal monarchy, and departed on 25 January 1832 for Terceira, from Belle-Isle. He was appointed Ministro e Secret√°rio de Estado dos Neg√≥cios da Fazenda (Minister and Secretary of State for Finance Affairs) and interim Ministro dos Neg√≥cios Eclesi√°sticos (Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs) and Ministro da Justi√ßa (Minister of Justice) in Angra on 2 March 1832. On 23 April 1832, accompanied by Peter IV, he traveled to Ponta Delgada, before departing the Azores with an expeditionary force to Mindelo. While in the Azores, Mouzinho promulgated 24 decrees and ordinances to reform the administration of the islands‚Äô government. He disembarked in Mindelo on 8 July, where he traveled to Porto, encircled by Miguelist forces. After their defeat, he remained in Porto, promulgating several reforms, publishing 20 decrees and ordinance. Devorism On 9 August, in complete disagreement with the progress of public finances, particularly with loans obtained by Palmela, and harassed by his opponents, who accused him of radicalism and folly, he sought a resignation from the positions he held, which was granted on 3 December 1832 by Pedro IV. He abandoned the Ministry exactly nine months after being nominated, leaving behind 44 decrees and ordinances, that were the base of the modern Portuguese tax system, and introduced a reform in the judicial system. In this short span, and during the civil war, Mouzinho affirmed his position as one of the more important personalities of Liberalism in Portugal. While the tax system has evolved significantly, Mouzinho was responsible for the foundations of the Supreme Court of Justice and re-structuring of the Public Ministry. During the month of December 1832, and month of January 1833, he was placed in the task of obtaining funds for Liberal forces participating in the Barra de Lisboa (the city was still in the control of Miguelist forces), and developed activities in Vigo. Continuing to disagree with the condition of the public finances, he was fired from these tasks, and renominated Director of Customs. However, he left for a new period of exile in Paris on 19 March 1833. He returned to Portugal on 11 September 1834, and joined the Chamber of Deputies, where he remained until 1836, always uncompromising in his defense of his legislation and maintaining a constant intervention in matters of the public finances. In the 1835 elections he was re-elected deputy for the Alentejo. On 16 August 1836, he refused to pledge allegiance to the 1822 Constitution, and resigned from his post as Director of Customs. He was imprisoned, and when released, he returned to exile in France. Later life He returned to Portugal in 1839, returning to the Chamber of Deputies on 15 February, and remained in this post until 1840, and continued to intervene on matters of public finances. In 1842 he became a candidate for deputy to the Alentejo, but lost by two votes. On 1 December 1844, Mouzinho was charged with elaborating a general regulation for the customs-houses. His personal finances improved in 1846, but his hopes for his son were dashed, and his personal health began to deteriorate, at the time that his wife began residing in Paris. Jos√© Xavier Mouzinho da Silveira died in Lisbon, on 4 April 1849, after a fall on his staircase, caused when he was moving a piano, resulting in his being crushed. Memorials Starting in 1875, with erection of a monument in the parish of Margem, municipality of Gavi√£o, sculpted by C√©lestin Anatole Calmels, many Portuguese community have honored this notable citizen. In the Sala dos Passos Perdidos, in the Palace of S√£o Bento, Mouzinho da Silveira was homaged with an oil painting by Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, while a comparable painting in Municipal hall of Lisbon, painted by Jos√© Rodrigues (executed in 1866) honours the politician, and in the Gr√£o Vasco Museum (Viseu) a similar painting of Mouzinho by Columbano was framed. While, in the secondary centenary of his birth (1980) a commemorative monument was inaugurated in Castelo de Vide, many of the cities of the country have homages to the Mouzinho da Silveira, including schools and roadways.

Description Yellow cassava is similar to ordinary varieties of cassava (Manihot esculenta, see cassava) but it has a yellow flesh inside the root, which is generally white in ordinary varieties. Cassava is a woody shrub that grows large roots, which are harvested for consumption. The roots consist of three parts: the central pith, the peel, and a vascular bundle within the central pith. The new yellow varieties have high yields and are resistant to many pests and diseases. Like ordinary cassava, it does not need nutrient rich soils or extensive land preparation and does not suffer during droughts.Consortium. (2012).

The three varieties of yellow cassava, UMUCASS 36, UMUCASS 37, and UMUCASS 38, are the results of a 12-year contest in Nigeria funded by HarvestPlus, through the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and Nigeria‚Äôs National Root Crop Research Institute. Breeding is ongoing and new innovations hope to achieve a Œ≤-carotene level of 15 micrograms/gram by 2015. Growing Conditions The new yellow varieties have high yields and are resistant to many pests and diseases. Like ordinary cassava, they do not need nutrient rich soils or extensive land preparation and do not suffer significantly as many other crops during droughts. Post- harvest processing Cassava is usually stored in the ground until needed, as it is highly perishable after harvest. Drying of the tuber is one simple method of cassava preservation; however some methods of drying are more effective than others in terms of retaining Œ≤-carotene levels. Oven drying at 60‚Å∞C was shown to maintain 72% of the Œ≤-carotene levels though the retention fell to 40% after four weeks in storage. Sun drying only resulted in a 38% retention of Œ≤-carotene levels, and after four weeks in storage, the levels fell to about 18%.Chavez, A., S√°nchez, T., Ceballos, H., Rodriguez-Amaya, D., Nestel, P., Tohme, J. and Ishitani, M.

Beta-carotene stability during drying and storage of cassava and sweet potato. II International Symposium on Human Health Effects of Fruits and Vegetables: FAVHEALTH 2007 841, 363-366. Retention of carotenoids in cassava processing Œ≤-carotene retention can be improved by pretreatments such as blanching and osmotic dehydration. Peeling of cassava roots is very labour- intensive. Breeding efforts have been executed to select for a white peel in order to reduce the labour associated with peel removal. One cultivar, Branca de Santa Catarina, has been selected for this reason. Though cassava is easily perishable once harvested, it is beneficial to rural farmers because it can act as an insurance crop during droughts or other crop failures. However, carotenoid accumulation in cassava has been found to be accompanied by marked reductions in post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) of storage roots. This is worth looking into to maximize the potential of this staple crop for both nutritional and industrial use. Genetic Stocks/Breeding Three genetic types are being grown in Nigeria, UMUCASS 36, UMUCASS 37, and UMUCASS 38. Cassava can reproduce sexually or by propagation.Ceballos, H., Iglesias, C., Perez, J., & Dixon, A. (2004). Cassava breeding: Opportunities and challenges. Plant Molecular Biology, 56(4), 503-516. scholarsportal pdf Yellow cassava cannot be purchased from any producers currently, but a distribution system is being implemented in Nigeria providing 25,000 local households with stems under the condition that they will share their stems with other rural farmers the next season. This is the main approach to widen the distribution of yellow cassava. Complaints about Yellow Cassava (Controversies) In 2011, environmental rights action group Friends of the Earth Nigeria (FoEN) unsuccessfully demanded a halt to any research on genetically modified cassava in Nigeria by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) research team, arguing that IITA is undermining biodiversity. ‚Ä≥We can get vitamin A from carrots,' Mariann Bassey, coordinator of Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (FoEN), told journalists. 'We do not need this so-called 'biofortified' cassava. Why will you (IITA) not leave this classic Southern crop alone?‚Ä≥ Bassey said biofortified cassava research was a replay of what she termed the 'Golden Rice hoax'. According to Bassey, Golden Rice, developed in 1999 to treat vitamin A deficiency, had fundamental problems. She said an adult would need to eat around nine kg of cooked rice a day for the required intake of vitamin A, whereas eating just two carrots would suffice. Carrots, however, are not frequently consumed or available in much of Nigeria. Researchers have examined consumer willingness to purchase and eat yellow cassava in Nigeria and found that, in the absence of nutritional information, light yellow varieties are prized over white ones in the southwest (Oyo State) but not the southeast (Imo State). With an information campaign, yellow varieties capture larger premiums over white in all regions.Oparinde, Adewale, Abhijit Banerji, Ekin Birol, and Paul Ilona. Information and consumer willingness to pay for biofortified yellow cassava: evidence from experimental auctions in Nigeria. Vol. 13. Intl Food Policy Res Inst, 2014. Consumption and Uses The edible portion of the cassava root is the central pith. It is an excellent source of carbohydrates. The peel surrounding the root is inedible, although it can be used as feed for pigs and goats. Some farmers will harvest and eat the leaves as a vegetable. These \\"leaves are a major component of the diet\\" in The \\"Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea\\". Nutritional Information Vitamin A deficiency is common in sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, it affects about 20% of pregnant women and 30% of children under five. It can impair immune systems and vision which could cause blindness and, in some cases, death. Yellow cassava contains high levels of Œ≤-carotene, which is a precursor to vitamin A. Cassava is also a major source of carbohydrates, 80% of which are starches. The new, yellow cassava can provide up to 25% of daily recommended Vitamin A intake. Since cassava is a major part of many people‚Äôs diets, introducing cassava bio-fortified with Vitamin A is an excellent innovation to improve health on a large scale. Social/Cultural Benefits/Issues It is normally risky to change the colour of a staple crop because colour preference can negatively affect consumer adoption rates. This is not the case with yellow cassava. Since local consumers often add palm oil to white cassava flour in their foods, they are normally accustomed to the golden colour. Therefore, the yellow colour has been shown not to deter consumers. Constraints to Wider Adoption Cassava is primarily grown and eaten in rural areas. Its perishability is a constraint to breeding and innovation because when the crop starts to rot within days, it cannot be analyzed in a lab for any long periods of time. Since it is highly perishable, it is not a good export crop and its distribution requires a localized approach. Practical Information Since cassava can be reproduced through propagation, cutting off part of the stem and sharing it with other farmers is a good way to provide Vitamin A-rich yellow cassava to rural populations. When preserving cassava, pretreating prior to drying can have a positive effect of the level of Œ≤-carotene retention during storage. Since cassava does not have a critical time of harvest, it is recommended to grow a lot of cassava and harvest it the day of consumption. This makes cassava a good insurance crop for times when food is scarce.

The Wrinstone estate was variously also known as Wrenston, Wrencheston or Wrenchester. The Barry Railway line ran past the hamlet and entered the Wenvoe Tunnel just to the north near Wenvoe Quarry. It closed after a fire in 1963. History A manor was held here from the early Norman period, and at various points the lords of Wrinstone Manor were in control of the nearby Cwrt-yr-Ala estate and property. Walter of Gloucester was known to have held Wrinstone in the mid 13th century, but by 1262 it was held by Walter de Reigny, who also held the nearby manor of Michaelston-le- Pit. It was then ceded to his son Milo de Reigny. Milo's daughter, Ela (or Joan) (b. 1235), became the heiress of Wrenchester (Wrinstone)) Castle, Michaelston-le-Pit, Llantwit, and Llancarvan. Through her marriage to Simon de Raleigh, of Nettlecombe, Somerset, the Wrinstone manor passed to the de Raleighs, their descendants holding the manor for six generations. Their son, also named Simon, became High Sheriff of Glamorgan in 1299, until 1304. Thomas Whellesborough, heir of a Simon de Raleigh, was lord of the manor until his death in 1482. Around 1480, there were eight free tenements. Of the twelve customary tenements, one was a freeholding owned by a William Yeston of Le Grave (later Greave Farm) which was in size. The other customary tenements ranged in size between ; there were also three cottagers. The manor eventually fell to the Trevelyans who sold their Welsh estates off in 1650 to pay off debts for supporting Charles I. The manor briefly fell into possession of Colonel Thomas Horton's Brigade for victory at the Battle of St Fagans in 1648, who then sold it to Colonel Philip Jones of the Fonmon Estate. From this date until the end of the 18th century it was under the Jones's of Fonmon and the Thomases of Wenvoe. It became a township of Wenvoe after the medieval period. In 1685 the hamlet had 20 tenements. Estate plans dated to the 1760s reveal 9 houses; 5 farms and 4 cottages, grouped around a green. By 1839 it had been reduced to 5 houses. Geography Arable lands are located by Wrinstone Brook, which, along with its tributaries, drains into Cog Moors, Dinas Powys, Pablin, and the Barry Docks. Wrinstone and Michaelston-le-Pit were contiguous manors. The remains of a trail, roughly 4 metres wide on average, leads from the hamlet to the Church Field. To the southeast is St. Andrews Major and Dinas Powys. To the northeast is a quarry and Caerau, a western suburb of Cardiff. Notable landmarks Farm land at Wrinstone Local countryside Wrinstone House is a country house, built in 1880 on the site of the old gamekeepers cottage. It is a well-appointed stylish white house, perhaps influenced by William Burges, with two distinct turreted wings added in the 1980s, containing six extra rooms. The house contains 16 rooms in all, with 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms and has an outdoor swimming pool and tennis court, rare in Glamorgan. No traces of Wrinston/Wrencheston castle exist except for disturbed ground in the area of Wrinston's farm buildings. It was known to have been established in the Middle Ages, but was destroyed in the early 18th century. Leland documents that a while ago it was in ruin but for one high tower. The hamlet also had a church, believed to have been located to the northwest of the present farm here, named \\"Church Field\\". Several fragments of medieval walls have been unearthed in the vicinity, and the fragments of a side wall of a medieval building have been found built into a 6.1m by 2.1 m wall, made of limestone rubble with hard sandy mortar.

The cemetery is the only surviving remnant of the community of Trippe Junction, established in 1857 by the families of William Fletcher Trippe and his brother-in-law Benjamin McGehee. A railroad spur line was constructed to the area in 1877, and a small town grew up around it. By the 1920s all of its businesses had failed, and by 1930 all but one building had succumbed to fire. The Holly Grove Methodist Church adjoined the cemetery, and was the site of many funeral services. The church was serving as a school when it burned in 1913. In 1958, a group of citizens raised money to assist with maintenance and upkeep of the cemetery. A bicentennial marker was erected by the Desha Historical Society in 1974. The southern section of the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The cemetery is composed of two sections, as it is divided by Arkansas Highway 4. The northern section continues to be used for burials, while the southern section is the location of 90 historic graves. It is bounded by a golf course on the west, a pasture to the east, and Crooked Bayou to the south. Its entrance is marked by the bicentennial marker, and there is a narrow dirt road forming a U shape providing vehicular access through the grounds. The oldest grave is that of Benjamin Scott McGehee, an infant who lived one month in 1862. Many graves are of immigrants born in Europe. Claude W. James, who owned several businesses in Trippe Junction and rode with Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders, is interred here.

They are found in ten-limbed cephalopods (including squid, bobtail squid, cuttlefish, and Spirula) as well as in the eight-limbed cirrate octopuses and vampire squid. Many extinct cephalopod groups also possessed fins. Nautiluses and the more familiar incirrate octopuses lack swimming fins. An extreme development of the cephalopod fin is seen in the bigfin squid of the family Magnapinnidae.Vecchione, M. & R.E. Young (1998).

In most cephalopods, the fins are restricted to the posterior end of the mantle, but in cuttlefish and some squid they span the mantle's entire length.

During Tang Dynasty  Yao Ji's background is not clear, as there was no biography of his in the four relevant official histories ‚Äî the Old Book of Tang, the New Book of Tang, the History of the Five Dynasties, and the New History of the Five Dynasties. However, it appeared that at some point he served as a staff member to the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as there is an extant poem by the Buddhist monk-poet Guanxiu to Yao congratulating him on being recalled from serving on staff at Jiangling Municipality (Ê±üÈôµ), the capital of Jingnan Circuit, back to the capital Chang'an, apparently to serve as a low-level consultant in the imperial government, Shiyi (ÊãæÈÅ∫), but it is not clear when Guangxiu wrote it.See To the Shiyi Yao Ji, on His Return from Staff at Jiangling to the Capital. The first substantially datable historical reference to Yao was in 902, when then- reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang had been forcibly taken by powerful eunuchs, led by Han Quanhui and Zhang Yanhong (ÂºµÂΩ•Âºò), to Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), then governed by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen, the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang. At that time, both Yao and his friend Han Wo were serving as imperial scholars (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi) and had accompanied Emperor Zhaozong to Fengxiang; subsequently, Li Maozhen's rival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) put Fengxiang Circuit's capital Fengxiang Municipality under siege. When the chancellor Wei Yifan was forced to leave the imperial government for some time because his mother had died, the eunuchs initially recommended that Yao become chancellor to replace Wei. Han Wo recommended that Yao decline the commission:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Yao thus claimed to be ill and declined the commission, and Emperor Zhaozong himself was also not inclined to issue it. Instead, the position went to Su Jian. Later in the year, under the pressure from Li Maozhen and the eunuchs, Emperor Zhaozong was set to recall Wei back to the imperial government to again serve as chancellor, but when the draft edict was assigned to Han Wo to be written, Han refused to draft it ‚Äî pointing out that having Wei return to the government after such a short mourning period was unseemly, so Emperor Zhaozong delayed the commission for some time. However, he eventually gave in to pressure, and had Yao instead draft it, and Wei was able to return as a chancellor. (Wei died shortly after, however.) At that time, Emperor Zhaozong was under virtual house arrest. On an occasion late in 902, when the eunuchs guarding him were not around, he had his concubine, the Lady of Zhao, quickly summon Yao and Han Wo to his residence, for a brief meeting. He was, however, only able to hold their hands briefly and weep, before Yao reminded him that they might be discovered, and so they separated quickly. In 903, Li Maozhen was forced to capitulate, slaughter the eunuchs, and surrender the emperor and the imperial household to Zhu. After that, while it is known that Han Wo was exiled for offending Zhu and Zhu's ally, the chancellor Cui Yin,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. historical references to Yao disappeared for some time.  During Later Liang  Zhu Quanzhong subsequently usurped the Tang throne, establishing a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu. In 913, by which time his son Zhu Zhen was emperor, Yao Ji, who was then serving as the chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤Â§ßÂ§´, Yushi Daifu), was given the chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), and was also made Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. He was also referred to at that time as the Marquess of Wuxing, presumably a title that was previously created him by a Later Liang emperor.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 8. That was the last historical reference to Yao, and it is not known when he left office or when he died.

It uses a bag filled with rocks or earth, attached to a cord, which slowly descends similar to the weight drive in a cuckoo clock. This action powers the light for up to twenty minutes.  History An early Gravity Light concept was developed concurrently by Clay Moulton and also by Ruphan as part of his Ph.D. in applied physics from the University of Alabama in 2017. While Moulton did not reportedly develop a prototype, Wofsey did develop a rudimentary prototype that used a custom-machined rare earth magnet motor with minimal gearing. Wofsey secured the www.gravitylight.com domain to disseminate the findings, however he did not pursue the gravity light as he decided the efficiency was too low to be commercially viable. The theoretical efficiency of the device is limited by taking the simple potential energy generated by raising a mass to a specified height, and then dividing it by the desired time that the lamp is to stay lit. Even a relatively large mass of 10 kg, when raised to a height of 1 meter, produces a maximum available energy of only about 98 joules; dividing by a desired illumination time of just 5 minutes would return a usable power of only 0.32 watts. Moreover, this would be for an unrealistic 100% conversion efficiency; that of the University of Alabama prototype was closer to 50%, which in our example would further reduce usable power to just 0.16 watts. At 5.5 operating voltage of an LED, that left only 20 milliamperes for the LED. This is sufficient to light an LED, but the available light from the LED would not likely be useful for reading or night activities. A modification to this approach was suggested where the power draw can be adjusted by the user to trade illumination brightness for illumination time.  Funding and development The first IndieGoGo campaign of GravityLight was ended on January 18, 2013 with $399,590 funded by 6219 funders. The second IndieGoGo campaign, GravityLight 2: Made in Africa ended on July 18, 2015. It featured an improved design and the goal of manufacturing them in Kenya. Martin Riddiford and Jim Reeves worked on GravityLight as a side project for four years.  Operation  There are no operating costs after the initial purchase of the appliance. A standard GravityLight kit comes with an adjustable lamp and a ballast bag. The light can be turned on by filling the bag with approximately 20 pounds weight (10 kg) and lifting it up to the base of the device; the weight falls over a period of 25 minutes, pulling a cord/strap that spins gears and drives an electric generator, which continuously powers an LED. This creates enough energy to last 25 minutes whenever it is needed. The second model, GL02, also includes two SatLights and connecting cables. These are separate lights that are wired in series from the main GravityLight unit. Each SatLight can be turned on or off separately. When used with SatLights, the light on the main unit can be turned on or off. Up to 4 SatLights can be connected, giving extra light to different locations in the house. The rate of the bag drop is almost not affected by the number of SatLights attached. The original GravityLight used a strap for pulling up the weight. The improved GL02 used a plastic-bead chain on a pulley system. The pulley system requires less strength to pull up.  In the media  GravityLight was called one of The 25 Best Inventions of the Year 2013 by Time Magazine.

This was a prominent event of the period of the Second World War. The event Following the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Grand Council of Fascism voted, on 25 July 1943, with 19 against 8 votes and one abstention, to strip Mussolini of his function as Duce. When Mussolini refused to accept this decision and his dismissal by the king, he was arrested. In September 1943, German paratroopers rescued Mussolini from his captors via the Gran Sasso raid. He was then installed as the leader of the Italian Social Republic, effectively a puppet state of Nazi Germany. At the urging of the German authorities, the ISR persecuted those plotters they could find, six in number. These included Giovanni Marinelli; Carlo Pareschi; Luciano Gottardi; Galeazzo Ciano, the former Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Mussolini's son-in-law; the honoured Marshal of Italy Emilio De Bono; and Tullio Cianetti. All of the six captured defendants were found guilty, and all, except Cianetti, were sentenced to death. Another three of the nineteen prominent persons who had voted against Mussolini, although not captured, were also tried and sentenced to death in absentia, among them Dino Grandi, who had been responsible for the agenda of the meeting of July 25. The trial took place between 8 and 10 January 1944. The execution of the five captured defendants who had been sentenced to death was performed as hastily as possible, by firing squad, on the morning of 11 January 1944. The condemned were tied to chairs and shot in the back by a Blackshirts firing squad, under the supervision of SS officers who also photographed and filmed the event. Ciano twisted around in his chair to face his executioners.Mussolini - en studie i makt by G√∂ran H√§gg, , p.333 A contemporary comment Victor Klemperer, a famous Dresden-based literature professor and diarist, who - although being Jewish \\\\- had survived the Hitler years, writing diary notices for almost every day,Victor Klemperer: Ich will Zeugnis ablegen bis zum letzten, Tageb√ºcher 1933-1941 und 1942-1945, Aufbau- Verlag, 11. Aufl., Berlin 1995, (in German; I will give witness until the last minute, diary notes 1933 - 1945) commented on the trial and the execution in a diary notice from 15 January 1944 as follows (translating the German original): :\\"For me it is certain that the trial was a farce, that the execution was the work of the Germans, that Mussolini had almost nothing to do any longer with the whole affairhe is now almost invisible, the shadow of a puppet -, above all: that with this whole affair one wants to deter primarily internal opponents (Paulus, Seydlitz).\\" Film A 1963 film, Il processo di Verona, by Carlo Lizzani depicts the trial and stresses the fate of Ciano.

Early life  Cornelius Hendrickson was born around 1572, the son of Lambert Barrentje Hendrickson, an admiral in the Dutch Navy. Nicknamed \\"Pretty Lambert\\", the admiral was a friend and associate of Admiral Jacob van Heemskerk, and commanded De Tijger in the Battle of Gibraltar of April 1607.  Onrust  Delaware Bay In November 1613, Dutch fur trader Adrian Block was preparing to return to Holland with a cargo of furs when his ship, the , caught fire and was destroyed while moored in the North River near the tip of Manhattan Island. Over the winter, Block and his crew built the (Restless), which he used to explore the East River and Long Island Sound. The Onrust was long with a capacity of 16 tons.Van Dusen, Albert \\"Connecticut\\" Random House, 1961, p. 19 Later that year, Block rendezvoused with Hendrick Christiaensen off Cape Cod. Before boarding the Fortuyn to return to the Netherlands, Block turned the Onrust over to Hendrickson. In 1614, Hendrickson navigated the Onrust, through Barnegat Inlet to the Toms River, which he charted, along with Barnegat Bay, and Great Bay to the south. In mid-to-late 1615, Hendrickson sailed into Godins Bay (Delaware Bay) and up the Zuyd Rivier (South River) to the Schuylkill River, searching for a site to establish a trading post for the Dutch West India Company. Hendricksz's voyage was made aboard the IJseren Vercken (Iron Hog), a vessel built in America. During the winter of 1614‚Äì1615, some Dutch sailors remained at Fort Nassau to engage in the fur trade. Interested in the benefit of Dutch firearms, the Mohawk persuaded three to accompany them on a raid against the Susquehannocks. That spring the sailors were captured by the Susquehannocks who brought them south. In the course of his explorations Hendrickson he met a band of Susquehannock (Minquas) and ransomed the three for kettles, beads, and trade goods.Parmenter, Jon W., \\"Separate Vessels\\", The Worlds of the Seventeenth-Century Hudson Valley, (Jaap Jacobs, L.

It is located northeast of the village of Sulphur Springs, also known as White Sulphur Springs, in Jefferson County. History The American Civil War started in April 1861 and White Sulphur Springs became a staging and training area for troops who came into Pine Bluff to be organized into units. In late July 1861, the 9th Arkansas Infantry Regiment was organized and trained at White Sulphur Springs and remained there for about a month before being shipped out to Tennessee. A few months later the Fagan's Guard, which later became the 2nd Arkansas Infantry Battalion, camped and trained near the springs before going on to Virginia. By the spring of 1862, the war had reached Arkansas and the Battle of Pea Ridge, in the north part of the state, was fought. It had become evident that the Union Army had come to stay and would attempt to take the state by marching on Little Rock. However, most of the Confederate Army was ordered to leave the state and go across the Mississippi River to help defend against the Union invasion of Mississippi. This left Arkansas almost totally defenseless. Protests were made to the Confederate government, and the governor of the state started raising another army. He had troops from Texas, who were passing through the state going east to the war, stopped and many of them were sent to White Sulphur Springs for their training and to be used in Arkansas. The Confederate Hospital was moved to White Sulphur Springs from Pine Bluff, and was set up in the Poole Hotel, the Female High School and the Methodist Church.Camp White Sulphur Springs Confederate Cemetery, Sulphur Springs, Jefferson County, Arkansas Historic Preservation Program.Accessed 20 March 2013, http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/historic- properties/_search_nomination_popup.aspx?id=2147 Troops that arrived at White Sulphur Springs from Texas and Oklahoma brought a measles epidemic with them and many of them died from the disease before even seeing a battlefield. Those who died were either buried in the Camp White Sulphur Springs Confederate Cemetery, which was near the Poole Hotel hospital, or where their camps were located throughout the community. Camp White Sulphur Springs became a Confederate military base of operation for the defense of the Lower Arkansas and White Rivers, located nine miles southwest of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, which contained several encampments of instruction and organization of new recruits. These Camps, such as Camp Lee, Camp R. G. Shaver's, Camp Holmes, and other smaller camps were all located within one mile of the community of present-day Sulphur Springs in Jefferson County, Arkansas, which served as a Headquarters, Commissary, and Hospital facility for these operations.Camp White Sulphur Springs Confederate Cemetery, Sulphur Springs, Arkansas, 1862‚Äì1863, Accessed 20 March 2013, http://www.angelfire.com/ar2/sulphursprings/cemhmpg.html It was used as a campground by a number of Arkansas, Texas and Louisiana units between late 1861 and early 1863.

Formation  Mydolls formed in 1978 in Houston, Texas. Dianna Ray and Trish Herrera began writing songs together. Dianna and Trish were then joined by Linda (Bond) Younger. After several attempts working with various auditioning drummers, Trish's cousin, George (Jorge) Reyes, joined the band, and the post- punk sound took shape as the band remained inspired by punk ranging from the 1960s-1970s, including Iggy Pop, Magazine, Television, Red Crayola, Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, NY Dolls, and other disruptive bands. Trish and Linda tended to play their guitars in a very unconventional way. Linda would sometimes play the top three strings, while Trish played the bottom three, making the sound textured. Meanwhile, Jorge Reyes percussive style de- emphasized a hi-hat based rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll meter in favor of a syncopated, Latin- flavored approach that concentrated on rhythmic tom tom usage rather than basic back-beats. The vocals, were mainly shared by Trish and Linda, with Dianna adding chanting and George singing back-up vocals on a few songs while playing drums. Since the band pre-dated punk as a strict genre, the band wasn't aware of making \\"mistakes,\\" since no musical box constricted them. Only later, they felt, did punk begin to form uniforms and formulas.  Early years  Mydolls traveled to London, England after the release of their first 45, In Technicolor (CIA, 1980) and were greeted by Mayo Thompson of the Red Crayola and workers at Rough Trade Records. While in London Mydolls went to BBC Radio to meet John Peel and were invited to do an on-air interview with him. In 1984, Mydolls traveled to New York City to attend the U.S. premiere of Wim Wenders' movie, Paris, Texas at the N.Y. Film Festival and played the after- party at the Danceteria. Mydolls appear in the movie in the bar scene, shot in Port Arthur, Texas, with Nastassja Kinski and Harry Dean Stanton, whom Herrera met personally in Telluride, Colorado. The film won the Palme d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival. Locally, Mydolls played in Houston at dance studios, outsider art environments such as Studio One, Farrell Dyde Dance Studio, art galleries, and The Museum of Fine Arts. They also played at more traditional music venues such as the Ale-house, Caribana, Rock Island, Numbers, Omni, Cabaret Voltaire, Rudyards, and Rockefellers. They found themselves sharing the bill with local luminaries Really Red, The Hates, Wild Bores, Culturcide, Introverts, Plastic idols, Recipients, Party Owls, Degenerates, Anarchitex, and Naked Amerika as well as traveling acts such as Minor Threat, Poison 13, Big Boys, Ragged Bags, The Cramps, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and Stickmen with Rayguns. In 1985, Mydolls played a farewell gig at the Orange Show.  Tours  Mydolls' tours took them to college towns and small alternative venues. In 1983, they completed a Midwest tour dubbed \\"The Dead Armadillo Tour\\" which included shows in Ohio, Illinois, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Missouri, and Michigan and a 1984 Midwest/East Coast jaunt, dubbed the \\"Go to Fish Tour,\\" stopping in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky. Mydolls' devoted sound engineer, Phil Davis, lovingly referred to as \\"Feedback Phil\\", was the original sound man for Paradise Island / Rock Island, a seminal first wave punk club in Houston. Phil traveled with Mydolls in order to ensure high-quality mixes at clubs. Selections from the board mixes recorded in Newport, Kentucky at the Jockey Club and at JB's in Kent, Ohio were included on the 12\\" EP Speak Softly and Carry A Big Stick.  Reformation  Kathy Johnston, Dianna Ray's wife, played guitar with Mydolls at their farewell show in 1985. She later collaborated with Dianna and Trish in the bands World War I (Women with Instruments), Black Dresses and They Should Have Been Blondes. Johnston continued to play live with Mydolls after their reformation in 2008. She died in 2011 of MDS, a rare blood cancer. In 2007, A World of Her Own, the Mydolls' complete anthology CD, was released by Grand Theft Audio. The set includes 2 CDs and a 24-page booklet of song lyrics, photos, flyers, and liner notes. In November 2008 Mydolls reformed to play at the \\"Noise and Smoke Festival\\" in Houston, Texas.  2011-Present  In January 2011, Mydolls were featured in the book Visual Vitriol: The Street Art and Subcultures of the Punk and Hardcore Generations (Univ. Press of Mississippi). They are featured in an extensive interview in the January 2013 issue of the long-time punk fanzine Maximumrocknroll. November 2012 saw them play at the wildly successful Island Reunion show celebrating the birthplace of punk rock in Houston. In August 2013, Mydolls were selected as one of only ten Houston artists to be inaugural inductees into the newly established Houston Music Hall of Fame along with Geto Boys, Gene Watson and ZZ Top In October 2013, Mydolls played at MEOW CON in Austin, along with featured guest Suzi Quatro. In Summer 2014, Mydolls played at Numbers Night Club in Houston, for the infamous street skate punk group, the Urban Animals reunion party. In the Spring of 2015, Mydolls played the North Texas music festival Denton 35 along with the English rock band The Zombies. In the Fall of 2015, Mydolls released a new eight song CD It's Too Hot for Revolution. Later in the same year, Mydolls traveled to California and played at the \\"Fabulosa Festival\\" in Yosemite,Fabulosa, 2015 Performers then traveled to Oakland, California, to open for The Avengers at Leo's Club.San Francisco Events Mydolls continues to play national and statewide shows on a regular basis.

It was listed on the National Register in 2005. History A local African American Baptist congregation formed in 1890, and the church was built in 1901. The church was used as a school until material became available to build a school. The church operated until 1976. Church members deeded the building to the City of Redfield in 1993.

In 1932 it set a new national endurance record with a flight of over 25 minutes. Design and development The Balestruccio was a single seat glider with a high aspect ratio gull wing built in four parts. The two inner panels, straight edged with constant chord and carrying dihedral, joined on top of the fuselage, their extremities braced from the lower fuselage with flat steel V-struts, encased in faired wood to reduce drag and assisted on each side by a pair of jury struts. The upper end of each strut was attached on one of the two wing spars. The outer wing panels were straight tapered, with rounded tips. There were differential ailerons on the outer trailing edges and flaps inboard. The fuselage of the Balestruccio was hexagonal, with deep, near vertical sides. Its comfortable cockpit was immediately in front of the wing leading edge and was originally provided with a wooden canopy with small side openings, similar to that used on the German DFS Fafnir, but this was later replaced with a more conventional open arrangement which provided better all-round visibility. A single, sprung skid and a tail bumper provided an undercarriage. The fuselage tapered aft to a mid mounted horizontal tail consisting almost entirely of the elevator; although this had straight leading edges, a combination of their slight sweep and the full, rounded trailing edges gave the planform an almost elliptical appearance. There were aerodynamic balances and a large cut-out for rudder movement. As first constructed, the vertical tail was rather similar, with a small fin and a full, deep, curved, balanced rudder which extended slightly below the keel. Later, with the fuselage shortened by one frame or about , the Balestruccio was given a new, angular fin and rudder with straight taper and square tip. Like the old rudder, this was also balanced and deep, though extending only to the keel. The original horizontal tail was retained. Operational history The Balesruccio proved to be versatile and efficient and was flown by Vittorio Bonomi and Enrico Rolandi from Mottarone and Campo dei Fiori di Varese. On 18 December 1932 Rolandi flew it for 25.8 minutes, setting a new Italian national endurance record, covering and winning the Castiglione Trophy. As late as 1937, it was demonstrating its performance in Asiago.

She is known for her modern interpretations of Turkish folk music. Early years T√ºlay German was born in Istanbul in 1935; she was the only child of her father, a civil servant, and her mother, a housewife. She began singing Turkish classical music at the age of four and during her primary school years performed Franz Schubert's St√§ndchen (aka Serenade) and Abends unter der Linde on radio. Belkƒ±s Aran, a well-known soprano of that time, secretly took the young T√ºlay to a German music teacher, who declared her an exceptional vocal talent. Although she did study piano formally for five years with Ferdi Statzer, her parents did not wish to send her to conservatory; instead she attended √úsk√ºdar American Academy in ƒ∞stanbul, from which she graduated in 1956. Career In Turkey When her father's professional duties brought the family to Ankara for brief periods, German wanted to go sing in night clubs there. Although her father refused to allow this, German would secretly slip out while her father was sleeping and began to regularly perform English and Spanish songs at a night club. Eventually, when German was 25 years old, a friend of her father discovered her singing in the night club and told her father of it, after which he immediately sent German away to Istanbul. Eventually, in Istanbul, German obtained her father's consent to pursue a musical career, and between 1960 and 1962, she made a name for herself as a jazz singer and began performing on weekly programs featuring the Salim Aƒüƒ±rba≈ü Quintet on Radio Istanbul. During this time she met her life partner Erdem Buri, a jazz performer and band leader who had achieved prominence in the 1940s, and had then become known for his radio talk shows on jazz in the 1950s. Buri encouraged German to sing folk songs in Turkish instead of foreign language songs, and she began performing on his radio program \\"Polyphonic Turkish Popular Music\\" (), helping to build a new repertory of works by renowned folk musicians and poets such as Ruhi Su, Melih Cevdet Anday and Yal√ßƒ±n Tura. Having been named \\"Best Singer\\" by the critics for her performance at the 1964 Balkan Melodies Festival held in Yugoslavia, German earned an appearance on the cover of the magazine \\"Arena\\". At this time, she released her single Bur√ßak Tarlasƒ±, widely acknowledged to be one of the first hits of Turkish pop music. Emigration to France In 1966, Buri was threatened with a 15-year prison sentence, ostensibly for having made Turkish translations of Georg W.F. Hegel's Dialectic and Science of Logic, works considered subversive in the Cold War climate of the time. Fleeing political repression, Buri and German emigrated to France, settling permanently in Paris. Embarking on a new phase of her career as an expatriate artist, German adopted the French stage name \\"Toula√Ø\\". She recorded ten singles in French, gave numerous solo concerts, as well as appearing alongside renowned artists such as Charles Aznavour, L√©o Ferr√© and The Moody Blues. She also hosted radio and television programs in France, Germany, Poland, Tunisia, Morocco, Netherlands and Brazil. Transcending traditional boundaries of genre, German's love songs and folk ballads established her reputation as an innovator of the 1960 and 1970s folk and jazz world. In 1981 her Turkish-language album (recorded in France) was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque of Acad√©mie Charles Cros. German's final album was titled Nazƒ±m Hikmet'e Saygƒ± (Respect to Nazƒ±m Hikmet). After a farewell concert in the Netherlands in 1987, T√ºlay German retired from performing.Biography Since the death of her partner Erdem Buri on January 2, 1993, German has retired from public life.

Masciantonio.  Plot  The film opens of an exterior of a house in the suburbs. In it, a young woman known only as \\"The Girl\\" is dancing around a house after preparing breakfast for herself. \\"The Girl\\" enters a bedroom and finds a man and a dead woman tied to chairs. The Girl acts shocked, but then it is revealed that she was the one who had captured and tortured this couple, killing a female relative and possibly their baby as well. The Girl finishes the husband off by stabbing him in the chest with a tap, collecting the blood that drips from it in a wine glass. The Girl then claims two more victims, an elderly woman whose medication she tampers with, and a high school student who she drowns in a bathtub after several unsuccessful attempts to electrocute her. The Girl moves forward to stalking Don Carpenter, a stoner and member of a band who lives alone, so The Girl easily captures him, and imprisons him in his recording studio basement. The Girl tortures and mutilates Don, and gives him drugs that cause him to experience hallucinations and flashbacks. Don's friends, band mates, and ex-girlfriend are also captured and tortured to death by The Girl. Eventually growing bored with Don, The Girl strangles him (inexplicably beginning to cry while doing so) as he weakly tries to do the same to her. Don's body and those of his friends are posed around the basement by The Girl, who then goes upstairs, where a party that Don had been planning is in full swing. The Girl greets the guests, leaves the house, and dances down the street. As the credits roll, Mike, one of Don's band mates who had seemingly died when The Girl tricked him into drinking drain cleaner, awakens, coughs up the chemicals, and screams for help when he realizes that he is now blind.  Cast   Literature  Two prequel short stories were written by Robert A. Masciantonio. The first, New Girl in Town, was included in Anthology Philly, while the second, Neighbor for Christmas, was released through Amazon.com. In January, 2013 it was announced on Icons of Frights that Masciantonio will continue the series of e-stories for each major American holiday, including New Year, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, and Easter. The six stories, including a revised version of New Girl in Town, were later compiled in a collection entitled A Girl For All Seasons, Volume 1.  Reception  Neighbor was called \\"deliciously dark and humorous\\" by Dread Central's Steve Barton, who awarded it a 4/5, while Audrey Quaranta of Fangoria gave the film a 3¬Ω out of 4, and categorized it as \\"definitely one for the gore-lover's library\\". In a review for Horror News, Todd Martin wrote, \\"Do yourself a huge favor. Run out and get a copy of Neighbor as soon as it is available to own. Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it. If I had to describe it in just a few words I would say it was brutal, disturbing, and at times, a little hard to watch (and this is coming from a hardcore gore fiend). I was very impressed by this film and I think that a lot of other viewers will be as well.\\" DVD Talk's Justin Felix found that the film began well, but eventually became \\"a chore to watch\\" that \\"devolves into an ugly and unconvincing exercise in 'torture porn' that abandons the film's earlier strengths and fails to engage the viewer\\". Gordon Sullivan of DVD Verdict wrote, \\"I really wanted to like Neighbor for America Olivo's performance (which is dark and funny in equal measure) and the overwhelming amount of attention lavished on the gore. However, the lack of any real plot or character development makes Neighbor hard to love.\\"  References   External links  * Category:American black comedy films Category:American films Category:American serial killer films Category:American independent films Category:English- language films Category:2000s exploitation films Category:Films about suburbia Category:Films set in Philadelphia Category:Films set in 2009 Category:Films shot in Pennsylvania Category:Mass murder in fiction Category:American nonlinear narrative films Category:American splatter films Category:2009 independent films Category:2009 films Category:2009 horror films Category:2000s serial killer films Category:2009 black comedy films Category:2009 comedy films Category:Films directed by Robert A.

Career   The Boombox EP (2008‚Äì2010)  Consisting of emcees Freeky P and Huggy Fresh, vocalist Adlib and DJ Relik, Boombox Saints released their debut EP The Boombox EP featuring the singles \\"Flip It\\" and \\"She Got\\" on November 9, 2010. After winning the Urban Music Association of Canada's Urban X-posure Triple Threat competition in 2009, the band received a singles digital deal with Nettwerk Music Group for \\"She Got\\". Soon after, the music video for \\"She Got\\" received support from MuchVibe and Aux TV.  Bringin' the Boom Back: Based on a True Story (2010‚Äì2012)  On March 8, 2011, the band self-released their follow up work Bringin' the Boom Back: Based on a True Story. Intended as a tribute to the era of '90s R&B; and hip hop that had helped craft the band's sound, Bringin' the Boom Back: Based on a True Story featured four singles: \\"Bringin' the Boom Back\\", \\"Gotta Let You Know\\", \\"Late Night Creep\\" and \\"The Break Up Song\\". \\"Bringin' the Boom Back\\" was produced by fellow Vancouverite K-Rec who remixed \\"It's Tricky\\" by Run-D.M.C., which soon became the title track for the Electronic Arts video game SSX Tricky.

For the Moment (2012‚Äìpresent)  The group released their debut album For the Moment on October 23, 2012. Freeky P described the album as \\"a post-modern, modern epic love tale of our collective lives tracked by a new-stalgic soundscape, detailing the joys and falls of relationships in the never ending chase of happiness. In short, walk 14 songs of our lives and you'll forever be changed\\". This explains the album cover, a pair of worn out Jordan Concord '11s originally belonging to Adlib. Further still, emcee Huggy Fresh has claimed that the album is \\"as outside the box as a fresh pair of J's\\". For the Moment features guest appearances from long time friends Emmalyn Estrada (\\"Blind\\", \\"Peekaboo Style\\") and Jenilee Reyes (\\"For You\\") as well as up and coming Vancouver singer/songwriter Vanessa Villabroza (\\"By My Side\\"). Following its release, music critic Stuart Derdeyn of The Province touted the album as \\"one of the more solid hip-hop releases to ever come out of town (Vancouver)\\" and the Vancouver Sun‚Ä≤s Francois Marchand added that For the Moment \\"is a reminder of the kind of heartfelt soul that rap can really deliver.\\" It has been featured in Postmedia Network outlets across Canada and received support from Exclaim!, CBC Music, !Earshot Magazine, Hip Hop Canada, The National Post, Canada.com, Dose.ca, BeatRoute Magazine, VancouverIsAwesome.com, WinnieCooper.net and The Snipe News.

But regarding the Nieuwe Waterweg and the Hartelkanaal it appeared in the mid-1980s that the levees were not high enough to ensure optimum protection of the territories densely populated South Holland. A heightening of all dikes would be too expensive. An alternative was found. In 1987 the final decision was taken, the Nieuwe Waterweg will be protected by dikes up to the location of a storm surge barrier, the Maeslantkering at Hoek van Holland, and the Hartelkanaal will be protected up to another storm surge barrier, the Hartelkering. Between those two barriers, the raising of all dikes will be required. The whole work was finally completed in 1997. The Delta Plan itself protects the Rhine‚ÄìMeuse‚ÄìScheldt delta, so mainly Zeeland, while the Europoortkering protects South Holland and not the Europoort which is situated before those protections.

Name The region takes its name from the tribe of the Ainianians, who dwelt in the area. The name Ainis first occurs in Roman times; the only known earlier name of the region was \\"land of the Aenianians\\", Ainian≈çn kh≈çra (Theopompus). Geography Ainis is located in the upper Spercheios valley, bordering with Dolopia in the west, Oita in the south, Malis in the east and Achaia Phthiotis in the north.H. Kramolisch, \\"Ainianes\\" Der Neue Pauly, Brill Online, 2013. The exact borders with Oita and Malis have never been established.M. H. Hansen & T. Heine Nielsen (eds.), An inventory of Archaic and Classical poleis, Oxford 2004. The river Spercheios floats through the region on its way down to the Maliac Gulf, and is joined in Ainis by its chief tributary the Inachos. The area is limited to the north by the Othrys mountains, and to the west by a spur of the Pindus mountains, with the peak of Tymphrestus visible from most of the region. To the south lies the peaks of Goulinas and Mount Oeta, separated by the river Inachus. Most of Ainis consists today of a fertile river plain; whether this was the case during Antiquity does however remain uncertain. As with Greece in general, there is some seismic activity with hot springs close to the village of Platystomo. After the introduction of modern heating, the previously bald foothills of the surrounding mountains are now covered with dense thickets of ivy and prickly pear. History Plutarch writes (Quest. Graec. 12) that the Ainianians were once expelled from Thessaly by the Lapiths to wander the Greek peninsula until they finally settled in the upper Valley of Spercheios. According to Plutarch, when the Ainianians finally settled in what would become Ainis, the land was already occupied by the Inachians and the Achaeans. Phemios, king of the Ainianians, however, killed Hyparochos king of the Inachians with a stone while the latter had his head turned, thus winning the region for his people.M. B. Sakellariou, \\"Between Memory and Oblivion\\", ŒúŒïŒõŒïŒ§ŒóŒúŒëŒ§Œë 12, Athens 1990. The Ainianians struck coins in Hypata with the head of Zeus on the obverse and the legendary king Phemios on the reverse.RE, Band I,1. Settlements Very little is known of the settlements in ancient Ainis apart from the city of Hypata. Several poleis (Kapheleis, Korophaioi, Phyrrhagioi and Talana) are mentioned in inscriptions at Delphi, but apart from Hypate, none has yet been convincingly identified. Moreover, other settlements that were not poleis have been identified, including Sosthenis and Spercheiai. A smaller settlement, that of Makra Kome, is also mentioned in a passage by Livy as being ravaged by the Aetolians during the Second Macedonian War. There are, however, several known sites in the area, mostly of the Hellenistic period, some of them of urban character. Hypata (Ypati). Hypata The \\"capital\\" of Ainis, Hypata (·ΩôœÄŒ¨œÑŒ±), was located at the modern town of Ypati on the northern slope of Mount Oeta; the name is probably derived from a corruption of hypo Oita (, meaning \\"near the Mount Oeta\\"). The ancient city was probably divided in a lower fortified city located approximately at the modern location of the town, and an acropolis which is still visible further up the mountain. Apart from some fortifications and inscriptions, very little of the ancient town is visible today; travelers in the early 20th century noted ancient blocks and slabs built into the modern houses, but most of these were probably destroyed when the German Wehrmacht demolished most of the town during the Second World War. The commanding tower on the acropolis is of a later date, built by the Genoese in the Middle Ages. The political area of Hypata probably extended far north on the river plain, which is also mentioned in several inscriptions. A road over Mount Oeta led southward from Hypata towards Kallion in Aetolia.\\"Hypata\\" in Stillewell et al., The Princeton encyclopedia of classical sites, Princeton University Press 1976. Most of Apuleius' The Golden Ass takes place in and about Hypata, which at the time of the novel was a thriving Roman city. After the introduction of Christianity, Hypata became a Metropolitan bishopric in the Roman province of Achaea. In Late Antiquity, Hypata became the refuge of citizens of Patras who fled the Slavic invasion of Greece; as a consequence, the town changed its name to Neopatras (\\"New Patras\\"), which it kept until the establishment of the modern Greek state in the 19th century. Kastrorakhi seen from Vitoli. Kastrorakhi An elongated hill near the village of Vitoli (ŒíŒØœÑŒøŒªŒ∑) bears the name Kastrorakhi (ŒöŒ±œÉœÑœÅœåœÅŒ±œáŒ∑, \\"castle ridge\\"), and on its top there are remains of a wall with many towers as well as an impressive gate. The wall encompasses the whole hill, which bears the shape of a skewed \\"T\\", and is only preserved to a limited degree. No remains of structures other than the circuit wall has been noted. The strategic importance of the fortifications are not to be underestimated since the location dominates the upper plain of the valley as well as the confluence of the Spercheios with its tributary, the Papagourna. The location is often associated with the ancient polis of Spercheiai, but the identification remains uncertain.Y. B√©quignon, La vall√©e de Spercheios, Paris 1937. St√§hlin, visiting the site in the early 1910s, wrote that it is impossible to see whether the site was inhabited in Antiquity due to later agricultural use of the hill. He was only able to find traces of reddish pottery at the location, which he dated to the Hellenistic period. B√©quignon, a couple of decades later, reports that the state of the walls were mediocre, probably due to stone robbing. The site at Ano Fteri. Ano Fteri Just south of Kastrorakhi, up the slope from Fteri, is another site of considerable size, known as Ellinika. A circular wall stretches around a plateau between two ravines. The view is quite commanding; all known sites in Ainis are visible from this location, making it a place of strategic importance.M. F. Papakonstandinou in AŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ≠Œ±œÇ Œì. BŒªŒ±œáœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ (ed.), ŒëœÅœáŒ±ŒπŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒØŒ±: ŒïœçŒ≤ŒøŒπŒ± & Œ£œÑŒµœÅŒµŒ¨ ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥Œ±, Athens 2009. The remains at Ano Fteri, as is also the case of Kastrorakhi, has been linked with the ancient polis of Spercheiai, but this theory has yet to be proven.F. St√§hlin, Das hellenische Thessalien ‚Äî Landeskundliche und geschichtliche Beschreibung Thessaliens in der hellenischen und r√∂mischen Zeit, Stuttgart 1924. The body of a female statue in tufa was found here in around 1973, no other finds have been published.Aupert Pierre, \\"Chronique des fouilles et d√©couvertes arch√©ologiques en Gr√®ce en 1977\\" in Bulletin de correspondance hell√©nique, Vol. 102, livr. 2, 1978. pp. 699. B√©quignon interpreted the site as a mere observation post and not a position of defense. View from Profitis Ilias. Profitis Ilias Located in the centre of ancient Ainis, the hill of Profitis Ilias (Œ†œÅŒøœÜŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ ŒóŒªŒØŒ±œÇ) overlooks most of the lower plains of the Spercheios and guards the pass of Giannitsou, leading north to Thessaly. A circular wall encloses the two peaks of the hill, creating a double acropolis with a shallow saddle in between. Very little is still to be seen at the site; most of the circular wall is lost, the most striking part being located along the southwestern slope with several foundations of towers. B√©quignon indicates that there were remains of house foundations on mainly the northern peak at the time of his visit in the 1920s. In the foothills and at the plain below the hill, Georges Roux in 1954 noted remains of a possible lower city, as well as some epigraphical material in the nearby village of Platystomo.G. Roux, \\"Note sur les antiquit√©s de Macra Com√®\\", BCH vol. 78, pp. 89-94, 1954. Roux and most other scholars of the early 20th century interpreted the remains at Profitis Ilias as the remains of Makra K≈çmƒì (ŒúŒ±Œ∫œÅ·Ω∞ ŒöœéŒºŒ∑), briefly mentioned in Livy, and the nearby town of Varybombi has since changed its name to Makrakomi as a result of this. St√§hlin, B√©quignon and Roux all date the remains at Profitis Ilias to the Hellenistic period (late 4th-early 2nd century B.C.E.), a view supported by finds from excavations conducted by the local ephorate of the Greek Archaeological Service at Lamia in the 1970s.Arch.Delt. 28 (1973), Chron. p. 280-281, 283. This has been contested by some local authors who claim that the hill is the location of the semi-mythical Phthia, home of Achilles.Œï. ŒëŒ¥Œ¨ŒºŒ±œÇ, Œ§. ŒïœÖŒ∏œÖŒºŒØŒøœÖ & Œí.

It is based and registered in Dubai and its operations are primarily located in Turkmenistan. The company was listed on the Irish Stock Exchange until it was acquired by the Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC). It is now a wholly owned upstream subsidiary of the ENOC- Group. History The company was established as Oliver Prospecting & Mining Co. Limited in Ireland by Dr. Oliver Conor Waldron in 1971. It changed its name to Dragon Oil in 1993 and invested in the Cheleken oilfield. The Emirates National Oil Company bought a majority stake in the company in 1999 and the headquarters were moved to Dubai that same year. In 1999, Dragon Oils signed a Production sharing agreement (PSA) with the Government of Turkmenistan, aiming to re-develop the Cheleken field in the Caspian Sea. The current PSA expires in 2025. Between 2002 and 2005 Dragon Oil raised capital for exploration. In 2012 Dragon Oil launched a $200 million share buyback and the shares in Dubai rose 7 %. In 2013 Forbes ranked Dragon Oil on Forbes Global 2000 at place 1902. From 2012 to 2015, Dragon Oil suffered setbacks caused by several delivery delays of a drilling platform, an important part of the companies progress in the Caspian Sea. In June 2015 the Emirates National Oil Company acquired the remaining 46% of Dragon Oil for ¬£3.7 billion, becoming the sole owner of Dragon Oil. ENOC had attempted to buy the remaining percentage since 2009, at 455p a share, and offered 650p in March 2015. The final price was 800p a share, after extensive back and forth with different minority shareholders. The company was delisted from the London and Irish Stock Exchange as of 7 September 2015. In November 2015, the company was in talks to invest around $10 billion into a natural gas pipeline, the Tapi project, from Turkmenistan to India. In 2016, Dragon pre-qualified for a bidding round for different new oil fields under new contract terms in Iraq and took part in a bidding round in 2018. In August 2017, Dragon Oil signed a five-year contract with Topaz Energy & Marine for the delivery of six new offshore vessels, including five anchor-handlers and one Emergency Recovery and Response Vessel. In 2018 Dragon Oil recorded a production of . In 2019 the company announced its plans to triple the production by 2025 as part of its upstream investment drive. In the next 10 years the company wanted to spend $13 billion to targets a higher production. In October 2019 Dragon Oil announces the take over of the BP Stake in the company GUPCO, which produces from the Gulf of Suez (Egypt) in partnership with EGPC. The daily production of GUPCO approaches 60.000 bopd. Overview of personnel The board of directors consists of Chairman Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Vice Chairman Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer. Other board members are Abdulrahman Al Saleh, Hussain Hassan Mirza Al Sayegh, Ahmad Buti Al Muhairbi, Ahmad Sharaf, and Abdulrahman Al Awar. The company is led by CEO Ali Rashid Al Jarwan.

Operations Dragon Oils headquarters is in Dubai, UAE. Further offices were previously located in Mazar-i-Sharif(Afghanistan), Cairo (Egypt), Tunis (Tunisia, and Algiers (Algeria). Its principal producing asset is at Cheleken, in the eastern section of the Caspian Sea, offshore from Turkmenistan.Dragon Oil of Dubai is breathing fire The National, 24 January 2012 The field is operated from the onshore base near the town of Hazar, Turkmenistan. In 2009-2010, Dragon Oil reached a production level of of oil per day from Chekelen and from 2011-2014, between of oil per day overall production capacity. The field holds an estimated of oil and condensates, and of gas reserves. The company produced an average of of oil per day in 2011, 76,600 in 2012, 73,750 in 2013 and 44,000 in 2014. By 2015, Dragon aimed to reach per day, by adding around of oil per day in production capacity through M&A;'s. Production from Cheleken reached of oil per day in June 2015. In 2018-2019 the production of Cheleken declined to 87.000 bopd Until Q12020, Dragon Oil was involved in exploration activities in Algeria (Tinrhert Nord Perimeter and Msari Akabli Perimeter), Egypt (East Zeit Bay), and Tunisia (the Bargou Exploration Permit). The legal process behind the Tunisian contracts has been questioned by Tunisian corruption watchdog I WATCH.

History Koluvere castle from the north-westA castle has existed on the strategic location since the 13th century. In 1439, it came into possession of the bishop of Saare-L√§√§ne () and functioned as one of the main residences of the bishop. During the Livonian War, a battle between an outnumbered Swedish army and a Russian army, resulting in a Swedish victory, was fought nearby. The clash, which took place in 1573, is known as the Battle of Lode. In 1560, insurgents during a peasant uprising reputedly also tried to storm the castle. Between 1646 and 1771, the castle belonged to the von L√∂wen family. By then it had lost its military significance and was henceforth used as an aristocratic residence. In 1771 it passed into the hands of Grigory Orlov after which it became the property of the Empress Catherine the Great. In 1786, the Empress found a use for the castle as a place of exile for Duchess Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel who had asked the Empress for protection from her violent husband, Prince Frederick of W√ºrtemberg. She died at the estate under unclear circumstances, only 23 years old. Her grave is located in the nearby Kullamaa church, and her life has inspired plenty of local lore. In 1797, Emperor Paul I presented the estate as a gift to general Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden. It remained in the possession of his heirs until 1919. Between 1924 and 2001, it was used by various welfare institutions. Architecture Reinhold von Buxhoeveden's coat of arms at Koluvere castle The castle is built on an artificial island created in a dammed up part of Liivi river. The high, square-shaped tower belongs to the oldest part of the castle and probably dates from the early 13th century, making it one of the oldest castle towers in Estonia. With the development of firearms, a large, round cannon-tower was added in the 16th century. From around this period a sculpted stone with the coat of arms of Reinhold von Buxhoeveden, bishop of Saare-L√§√§ne 1532‚Äì1541 also dates. During the time of the ownership of the von L√∂wen family (et), the castle lost its military importance. It was instead converted into a comfortable home. Thus, in about 1770 the interior was extensively redecorated in Rococo style. Later, during the 19th century, the interiors received a neo-Gothic appearance. Several annexes to the main building were erected during its time as a manor house, for example stables and granaries, but also a noteworthy neo-Gothic power station. The surroundings were also transformed into a picturesque park with ponds, a pavilion and an arched bridge adorned with obelisks (19th century). Several fires have damaged the castle, notably in 1840, 1905 and 1963. Still, it remains a very fine example of castle architecture in Estonia.

The term describes the acoustic bandwidth partitioning process that occurs in still-wild biomes by which non-human organisms adjust their vocalizations by frequency and time-shifting to compensate for vocal territory occupied by other vocal creatures. Thus, each species evolves to establish and maintain its own acoustic bandwidth so that its voice is not masked. For instance, notable examples of clear partitioning and species discrimination can be found in the spectrograms derived from the biophonic recordings made in most uncompromised tropical and subtropical rain forests. Additional studies with certain insects and amphibians tend to confirm the hypothesis.Luis J.

Ship history The Majestic, County of Peebles and British Commodore were three dismasted ship hulls bought by the Chilean Navy in 1898 in order to be beached and used as coaling stations for Chilean warships in the sparsely populated region of the Strait of Magellan as the Argentine‚ÄìChilean naval arms race put both countries at the brink of war. After the purchase from the Brocklebank Line, the Majestic was loaded with coal in England and towed to Punta Arenas. As the hull was considered seaworthy by the navy, the government decided to refit the ship to be used as training ship for seamen cadets. She was repaired in Talcahuano, and in 1904 was renamed Lautaro. Two years later, the cruiser Err√°zuriz (1890) became a school ship for seamen cadets replacing the Lautaro and the Lautaro sailed bound for Australia, Peru and Mexico in commercial use. In September 1919 she sailed for Japan loaded with 2,750 tons of saltpetre, finally returning to Chile in January 1921 with a cargo of weapons and explosives for the Chilean Army. She was stationed off the Quiriquina Island and used as drill ship for seaman cadets until 1950. The ship was finally sold on 5 June 1954.

Life Clementia (known as Mentia to her friends) was born in Brockdish, Norfolk, one of twelve children. Her family was Unitarian, and Clementia became the governess to the daughters of a Unitarian minister who ran a boys' boarding school at Hove. In 1842 Clementia married Peter Alfred Taylor, the cousin of her pupils. Taylor was later the Liberal Member of Parliament for Leicester. In 1863, Peter Taylor bought Aubrey House in the Campden Hill district of Holland Park in West London. The Taylors opened the Aubrey Institute in the grounds of the house; the institute gave young people the chance to improve a poor education they might have had. The lending library and reading room of the institute had over 500 books. Taylor, Mary Estlin and Eliza Wigham were active in anti-slavery movement in England and in 1863 they all served on Ladies' London Emancipation Society which Taylor led. The Taylors were also closely involved in the movement for Italian unification and Giuseppe Mazzini was a frequent visitor to Aubrey House. During his celebrated 1864 visit to London, a reception was held at Aubrey House for Giuseppe Garibaldi and after Garibaldi visited Mazzini. Noted radical figures at the reception included feminist Emilie Ashurst Venturi; Aurelio Saffi, Karl Blind, Ferdinand Freiligrath, Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc. In Moncure D. Conway's autobiography he describes the Taylor's salon at Aubrey House, and Clementia's \\"Pen and Pencil Club\\" at which the work of young writers and artists was read and exhibited. Conway, an American abolitionist and clergyman, moved to Notting Hill to be near the Taylors at Aubrey House. The Taylor's social gatherings were also noted by the American author Louisa May Alcott. Attendees of the \\"Pen and Pencil Club\\" included the diarist Arthur Munby, and many poets and authors who later achieved fame. Aubrey House was also visited by feminists Barbara Bodichon, Lydia Becker, Elizabeth Blackwell, and Elizabeth Malleson.MunODNB. Clementia Taylor was on the organizing committee of the 1866 petition in favour of women's suffrage that John Stuart Mill presented to the British parliament; the 1499 signatures were collated in Aubrey House. It was in the house that the Committee of the London National Society for Women's Suffrage, held its first meeting in July 1867.

Todd Robinson wrote and directed the film. It stars Ed Harris, David Duchovny and William Fichtner. The film tells the story of a Soviet Navy submarine captain attempting to prevent a war. It is loosely based on the real-life events involving the sinking of the submarine K-129 in 1968. Plot Captain Dmitri \\"Demi\\" Zubov (Harris) is a veteran Soviet Navy captain finishing up a career that failed to live up to the legacy of his legendary father. He is given an assignment by Markov (Henriksen) to lead a top secret mission and given the command of his old ship. Due to mistakes he made during his service, involving the deaths of six of his past crew in a collision and fire, this will be his last assignment and his only opportunity to command any ship at all. Demi interrupts a party involving his crew, including Alex Kozlov (Fichtner), his up-and-coming executive officer headed for great success. However, as Demi leaves his home to lead Alex and his crew on the secret mission, the presence of a KGB contingent led by agent Bruni (Duchovny), and ominous portents, begin to alter the objectives of the mission, causing Demi and Kozlov to become concerned. Furthermore, Markov commits suicide at his office window while watching the submarine depart. Demi and Kozlov are wary of Bruni and his men and soon discover his mission: to use a device known as the Phantom to alter their ship's acoustic signature to make them appear to be a civilian merchant vessel, or a number of other ships. After a demonstration, Demi questions Bruni about the device and the mission's objectives. Soon after, Bruni's men hold Demi at gunpoint. Bruni eventually reveals to Demi that he and his comrades are rogue operatives and not here under orders from the Soviet government. He explains that the United States military has started a secret program called \\"Dark Star\\" that will make the United States invulnerable to the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, and he and his fellow operatives fear for the safety of their homeland if its nuclear capabilities are rendered useless. Their plan is to start a nuclear war between the United States and China by disguising the ship as a Chinese vessel and launching a nuclear missile at the American Pacific Fleet off Midway. After Demi refuses to cooperate, he and those loyal to him are taken and locked away in the ship, where Demi explains his past failures and explains how he began to suffer from seizures and brain trauma after suffering a concussion from his sub's fateful collision with Markov's sub. Demi, Kozlov and the loyal crew plot and execute a plan that eventually takes back the ship and alerts another Russian submarine that they are in distress. Two other members of the crew, Tyrtov (Flanery) and Sasha (Gray-Stanford), attempt to disable the missile. They succeeded in disabling the warhead, even though the missile was fired. Eventually, fighting ensues onboard, resulting in the deaths of many of both Demi's crew and Bruni's men. The submarine is soon badly damaged by Soviet torpedoes and sinks to the ocean floor. The crew begin breathing in poisonous chlorine gas fumes produced by the mixture of seawater and battery acid, as Alex is sent on a rescue attempt for the remaining crew. Bruni explains to Demi that he was on board when the fire took place and that he was the man ordered by Demi to trap the men, leading to their demise. Eventually, the submarine is recovered and the remaining crew, including Demi and his men, are seen standing atop the ship. From the nearby dock, Demi's wife and daughter praise his actions while Alex, now a captain, salutes the sub, paying respects to his former commanding officer. It is then revealed that Demi and his men, watching from the submarine's deck, are ghosts, watching from the afterlife.

It is based in the Aboriginal communities of Hermannsburg (NT) and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory of Australia. Its focus is the life and work of the late Albert Namatjira, an Arrernte watercolour landscape artist. The project undertakes community work and has developed an award-winning touring theatre show, Namatjira, which depicts \\"the commercial appropriation of Aboriginal experience\\". Namatjira (the project) The Namatjira Project (2009-) is a community cultural development project conducted by arts and social change company Big hART in conjunction with the descendants of the late Australian Indigenous watercolour landscape artist Albert Namatjira. Based in the Aboriginal communities of Hermannsburg (NT) and Alice Springs, the project aims to strengthen intergenerational ties, to invigorate and preserve the legacy of Albert Namatjira's style of painting and to invite the general public to reflect on Namatjira's story as a prism through which to explore Australia's past, present and future in terms of intercultural social relations and national reconciliation with Indigenous people.Wilkins, Peter:Brilliant Portrayal of Indigenous Icon, The Canberra Times, 16 Sep 2011 \\"Namatjira is a timely reminder of the journey of reparation that still lies ahead.\\" The project is structured around the two pillars of community work and a touring theatre show. To help strengthen sustainable income for the next generation of Namatjira artists, Big hART partners with Ngurratjuta Many Hands Art Centre (Alice Springs) to host exhibitions of contemporary Namatjira paintings alongside the performances. The project also features a digital multimedia component, with an iPhone application developed to promote the Namatjira painting style, film-based workshops with the Hermannsburg School, the development of a documentary and live webcasts generated by the community and streamed from Hermannsburg (NT) as part of an exchange between the Ntaria school and Wynyard High School in Tasmania. Project The main inspiration for the Namatjira Project was drawn from Big hART's Ngapartji Ngapartji project. In this, Elton Wirri, kinship grandson of Albert Namatjira, was a cast member in the namesake theatre show, creating an extensive painting on the backdrop of the set. The reaction of audience members to the name \\"Namatjira\\" and the potential of the story to engage with contemporary Australian social issues prompted writer Scott Rankin, actor Trevor Jamieson and creative producer Sophia Marinos to research the story further. This brought them into contact with the extended Western Aranda Namatjira family. The project in its form and structure was then instigated with the consent of Namatjira family representatives as a way to strengthen the passing on and sharing of culture and artistic family tradition as begun by Albert Namatjira and his watercolour and landscape painting style. As part of this large-scale, layered, long-term engagement with the Namatjira family and their famous ancestor's legacy, the project runs painting and digital arts workshops in the isolated Hermannsburg community, organises intergenerational plein-air painting trips on country, works with the local choir and collaborates with family members to raise awareness of Albert's story. On the one hand, this is done by addressing issues surrounding the copyright of Namatijra's work; on the other hand, Big hART devised a professional theatre show on Albert's life in close consultation and collaboration with the family. Theatre show As theatre critic John McCallum writes, the stage production Namatjira tells ‚Äúa story about the commercial appropriation of Aboriginal experience, told in a performance that is a reappropriation of Namatjira's story by his family and descendants, who have worked with Big hART, and the company's director and writer Scott Rankin, to reclaim it‚Äù. In addition to help shape the story told, family members toured with the company throughout Australia as artists and performers, conducting watercolour painting workshops and creating large chalk drawings of their home country live on stage, while two professional actors transition between various roles to relate the story of their grandfather. The play employs both Anglo- and Indigenous theatrical conventions by combining direct address monologues with re-enactment, musical interpretation, symbolism, the use of historical source material and tight choreography. The play is infused with a musical score which alternates between wind and string instruments, gospel songs in Aranda and popular music to strengthen the emotive layer of the show. To parallel the portraiture of Albert Namatjira through words and stage action and to underline the centrality of the visual arts metaphor as a frame for this story, a painter creates a portrait in oil of the leading actor while the show is being performed. Plot synopsis The two-act playRankin, Scott: ‚ÄúNamatjira, written for the Namatjira Family, and Ngapartji Ngapartji written for the Jamieson Family‚Äù, Strawberry Hill: Currency Press, 2012 tells the life story of Albert Namatjira in linked, chronological vignettes with interspersed reflections commenting on contemporary Australian discourses. Act One speaks of Namatjira's birth in the central Australian desert and his subsequent upbringing on the Lutheran mission of Hermannsburg (NT), his elopement with his wife Rubina and the struggle to feed his family. Cultural differences between the Aranda and the Christian missionaries are playfully touched upon in scenes of Albert's early years and eventually crystallise around concepts of art, culture and economy as Albert meets painter and crippled war veteran Rex Battarbee, whose biography is juxtaposingly woven into the presentation of Albert's story. As their friendship evolves from a teacher-student relationship to one of equal engagement and artistic exchange, questions are raised regarding the state of contemporary Australian social relations. Act Two relates Albert Namatjira's continued struggle for economic sustenance and his rise to fame as artist in Australia and internationally. The story of achievement and professional recognition is expressed through the infatuation of the White Australian arts world and high society (including the young Queen Elizabeth) with the persona, cultural background and art of Albert Namatjira and his financial benefits stemming from this elevated profile. This story, however, is counterbalanced with that of racism and exploitation which is presented as endemic to the entire Australian social fabric, be it in the form of taxation without equal rights, his framing as anthropological curiosity in the minds of his admirers or the humbugging by his extended family. Albert Namatjira is presented as caught between two conflicting systems of value which in the play ultimately lead to his demise - he is jailed for supplying liquor to fellow community members and dies a broken man shortly after his release. The performance of the play concludes with a video of Namatjira's descendants talking about the project's beginnings, structure and benefits for the community.

Live. ASAP (2013). The song was produced by Hit-Boy, and features additional verses from fellow American rappers Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T. The song is a posse cut created to feel like an \\"original '90s underground track.\\" Upon the release of the album, high downloads resulted in the song peaking at number three on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.  Background  The song features an ensemble of young rappers Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.. Rocky described the meaning behind the song saying, \\"I wanted to make a posse cut that felt like an original '90s underground track, and I didn't have to tell anyone what to do.\\" He also said he \\"took it upon myself to feature all the people who I respect as artists of my generation.\\" Rocky wanted to make sure that the track turned out perfectly, so he pieced it together himself, determining the order of every feature. He also said his favorite verse in the song is K.R.I.T.'s. The song's title is a reference to New York City's No. 1 subway line. Rocky elaborated saying, \\"When you think about New York, you think about things like the subway, and I needed to bring it back to that essence,\\" he said. \\"[But] when I'm rapping and mentioning 'anything is better than that 1 train,' it's the truth.\\" He also said, \\"I was just thinking of each artist as a different train stop, and when you hear that beat, it just brings me back to like - well, for me, it brings me back to being at the bus stop or being on the train early in the morning, cold, mad at life on the way to school late. I'm showing up third period - that's the 1 train. Anything is better than the 1 train.\\" On December 18, 2012, the song leaked along with the rest of the album, a month before its retail release. Following the song's leak, it was rumored that Joey Badass would be signing to Jay-Z's Roc Nation record label, due to his comments in the song. However, in January 2013, Joey dispelled the rumors saying he would rather stay independent than sign to a major label for the time being.  Music and lyrics  \\"1 Train\\" features a looped instrumental sampled from the 2003 song \\"Senen\\" by Syrian artist, Assala Nasri. The song also features no refrain and continuous verses from the featured artists. Due to this it has received many comparisons to classic Wu- Tang Clan cypher style songs.  Critical reception  The song was met with generally positive reviews, and sparked much debate on which rapper had the strongest verse on the song. Luke Fox of Exclaim! named the song an \\"indisputable mega-posse cut, \\"1 Train\\" is an event song, the kind of 1990s throwback album cut that, in a bygone era, would cause a segment of heads to buy the CD just for that one tune.\\" Roman Cooper also gave the song a positive review saying, \\"\\"1 Train\\" is truly a must-listen as Rocky, Kendrick Lamar, Joey Bada$$, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson, and Big K.R.I.T. perfectly execute the cypher-style posse cut that's largely been missing since the 1990s. Each emcee comes correct, so don't be surprised if you and your friends will all have different favorite verses. The cut is also a perfect example of Rocky's refusal to be regional, as K.R.I.T.'s Southern drawl hits home just as well as Bronson's gritty NYC flavor.\\" Expert Witness of MSN Music called the song a \\"terrific virtual-posse cut.\\" Chris DeVillie of The A.V. Club credited Rocky for assembling an \\"eye-popping tag team of recent next big things to set the bar for 2013 posse cuts.\\" Idolator praised all the rappers verses and called the song an \\"utterly ferocious, old school posse cut. Andrew Nosnitsky of Spin called the song, \\"a flatlined true-school posse cut that features every rapper you've ever read about on a blog\\", also saying Danny Brown had the best verse. David Amidon of PopMatters said the instrumental \\"seems to go on forever despite a lot of solid verses, Hit-Boy‚Äôs beat just fails to bring any energy to the situation. You can feel him going for a classic 1993, gritty NYC type cypher beat but it‚Äôs just not there, a simple loud drum loop and a quickly grating violin swirl. It changes up a little but overall doesn‚Äôt really get the Aftermath meets DITC vibe it‚Äôs going for. It‚Äôs especially a shame considering the talents of the rappers on hand, and the risks that are taken elsewhere.\\" Michael Walsh of The Boston Phoenix called Rocky's verse his toughest on the album, however said that it was overshadowed by the guest appearances. Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine said the guests, \\"sound hungrier and more lyrically inventive than A$AP, who hangs back and contributes little.\\" Chris Kelly of Fact also gave it a more mixed review saying, it is \\"an interesting experiment, but one so obviously engineered for blog interest that it's tough to enjoy on its merits. It would have been better off as a segment at the BET Awards, rather than a six minute series of verses in the middle of the album.\\" Lucy Jones of NME also gave the song a mixed review, saying ASAP Rocky sounded weak compared to the guest rappers on the song. Dan Jackson of CMJ gave it a more negative review, calling it a \\"meandering, directionless mess.\\" Complex not only named Brown's verse the best of the song, they named his the sixth best verse of 2013. They said, \\"It's not just the sounds of Danny's voice that make this a memorable affair; the verse itself is the eccentric at his finest, from his tightly-packed wordplay (\\"That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch\\") to drug references to comedic lines, it's some of the most remarkable chaos around.\\" HipHopDX called it one of the most memorable tracks of 2013.

It was named after its benefactor, Ioannis Pangas (or Bangas). The Bangas Gymnasium became one of the most significant Greek educational institutions in the region during the late period of Ottoman rule.Koltsida, 2008: 256 History Ottoman period Greek education was thriving in Korc√´ during the last period of Ottoman rule, with the creation of kindergartens, primary and secondary level boys' schools, as well as girls' schools.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 255 Secondary level education was present in Korc√´ already from 1724, with the establishment of the Hellenic (Greek) School.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 253 The Gymnasium of Korytsa was founded in 1856, though during the first years of operation it was hosted in the facilities of the Hellenic School. In 1863, the Gymnasium consisted of five classes and started to operate in a new separate building, erected with the support of the local community fund, the Lasso. The latter aimed at the promotion of Greek cultural and educational activity in Korce. In 1889 a sixth class was added, thus providing full middle level education according to the Greek educational standards of that time. The costs of the Gymnasium were initially covered by the Greek consulate of Bitola. However, due to limited funding the school had to rely on local initiatives.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 253 In 1889, the national benefactor, entrepreneur and member of the local diaspora, Ioannis Pangas, took the initiative and subsidized educational and cultural projects, for the benefit of the Greek people in general.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 244 Among his initiatives, was an offer of 18,000 French francs, on annual basis, for the needs of the Gymnasium, including coverage of the teachers salary payments. Pangas, after whom the school was named, became also the main contributor of the Lasso.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 244 The teaching staff of the Bangas Gymnasium consisted mainly of university graduates, most of whom had studied at the University of Athens, as well as at the Athens Polytechnic and the Halki Seminary, Constantinople (Istanbul), and other institutions.Koltsida, 2008: 290 On the other hand, the majority of the students (ca. 70%) were natives of Korce, while the rest came from the surrounding towns and villages.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 254 The school provided also the necessary accommodation for the non-native students.Ismyrliadou, 1996: 254 1912-1930 During the Balkan Wars, the building of the Gymnasium was used as barracks by the Ottoman troops and then by the Greek Army. The latter entered the city on December 7, 1912, as a result of the Ottoman retreat in the region.Koltsida, 2008: 151 Following the armed struggle for the establishment of the Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus (1914), a part of the older students joined the Northern Epirote army, while some of them were arrested and imprisoned by the Albanian gendarmerie.Koltsida, 2008: 368 With the final incorporation of Korc√´ in Albania (1920), Greek education was prohibited in the city, as the city was not part of the recognized Greek minority zone by the state. Nevertheless, the Bangas Gymnasium continued its operation for some years, as a religious academy ( Bageio Ierodidaskaleio) under the direction of Vasileios Ioannidis. It ceased its operation in 1930. Academics The school program was supervised by the Committee for the Support of Greek Education and the Orthodox Church.Koltsida, 2008: 148 The curriculum emphasized humanistic, but especially classical education. Greek language lessons covered 37% of teaching hours. Teaching of the Greek language was conducted in the conservative katharevousa as well as in archaic Greek form used in ecclesiastical education. Archaic Greek was helpful in the understanding of ancient and ecclesiastical manuscripts, however, it wasn't helpful in everyday communication. For this reason the teaching staff also used vernacular Greek in direct interactions with the students. On the other hand, katharevousa was also helpful in the direction to promote a purely and strictly national education, according to Greek educational standards. Additional subjects included mathematics, history, French, Latin, Turkish, religion, geography and philosophy.Koltsida, 2008: 328-329 The bibliography used in the Gymnasium was similar to that of the Greek middle level schools in general, however, there were also books about the history of the city and the surrounding region, as well as translations of non-Greek books.Koltsida, 2008: 330 After a proposal by the local metropolitan bishop Photios, gymnastics became also part of the school program in the 1903-1904 schoolyear.Koltsida, 2008: 331 During the 1905-1906 schoolyear, the Gymnasium organized gymnastics events, which were open to the public.Koltsida, 2008: 401 In general, bishop Photios was interested in the general education of the city's youth and often made various proposal for its improvement. The students were also taught music.Koltsida, 2008: 400 Written exams were held three times each season: middle December, end February and middle May.Koltsida, 2008: 391 Moreover, celebrations in the Gymnasium took place on every January 7, the day of Saint John the Baptist, name day of Ioannis Pangas.Koltsida, 2008: 399 Notable teachers *Panteleimon Kotokos *Vasileios Ioannidis Notable alumni *Theophrastos Georgiadis References Sources * * Category:Education in the Ottoman Empire Category:Buildings and structures in Kor√ß√´ Category:Educational institutions established in 1856 Category:1856 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1930 ","title":"Bangas Gymnasium"},{"id":"38004316","title":"Bruce Nichols"},{"id":"38004318","text":"The Jewish Restitution Successor Organization Inc.

In France, the men continued their dispute with Kerlerec and were imprisoned in the Bastille for a short time. They were eventually proved right, and the government removed Kerlerec from office and sentenced him to exile. De Marigny returned to New Orleans, where he died in 1779. He was interred at the St. Louis Cathedral.Chambon, Celestin N.

It is located on Highway 358,& Greene 712 Road in Paragould, Arkansas. It is a modest single-story wood frame structure, built in 1901, and standing next to a cemetery established in 1882. The original Bethel Methodist Church was constructed in 1880, a small, onestory, white frame church. In 1900, a storm destroyed this building and in 1901 an almost identical building replaced the original structure. George Russell, a local carpenter, built the building using native materials of cypress and pine. It measures 20 feet by 40 feet and has a high pitched roof covered by tin. Exterior walls are covered with six inch beveled pine siding, while interior walls and ceiling are beaded pine wall board. Adjacent to it is a cemetery that dates to 1886.http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register- Listings/PDF/GE0015.nr.pdfThe first person buried here was Moss Widner in 1882. The building served the small community of Finch as not just a church, but also as a school, and was vacated in 1941. It was restored in the 1970s by a group of local concerned citizens, and is occasionally used for services. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

After debuting in 1982, he presented many TV programs, including Quelli che... il Calcio, Vieni via con me and Quello che (non) ho. Since 2003, he presents the weekly talk show Che tempo che fa, broadcast by Rai 3 and since September 2017 on Rai 1. He presented the Sanremo Music Festival in 1999 and in 2000. In June 2012, RAI confirmed he will present his third edition of the Italian singing competition in 2013. Biography Early life Fabio Fazio was born in Savona on 30 November 1964, to Giuseppe, from Varazze, and Delia from Calabria. After receiving the high school diploma at the liceo classico Gabriello Chiabrera in Savona, Fazio started studying Law, following his mother's suggestions. He later decided to leave his law studies, enrolling in the University of Genoa, where he graduated with 110/110 in Literature, discussing a thesis about literary elements in songs written by Italian cantautori. First radio and TV appearances In 1980, Fazio debuted as a radio personality, appearing in local stations such as Radio Vecchia Savona and Radio Golfo Ligure. In 1982, he debuted as a celebrity impersonator at RAI's radio program Black Out. After winning a contest organized by the Italian national broadcaster, Fazio made his first TV appearance in 1983, when he took part in Raffaella Carr√†'s show Pronto Raffaella?. During the following years, he appeared in many other TV programs, including Rai 1's game show Loretta Goggi in quiz, Rete 4's Sponsor City and Rai 3's L'orecchiocchio. In 1987, Fazio regularly appeared on Forza Italia, one of the first TV programs broadcast by Odeon TV, mixing talks about soccer matches with entertainment sketches. Between 1989 and 1990, he also worked for RAI programs Fate il vostro gioco and Mai dire mai. In 1990 and in 1991 he presented Banane, a satirical program broadcast by Telemontecarlo. For the same network, he worked as an author for the show T'amoTV. Quelli che... il Calcio and TV success In 1993, Fazio started presenting the show Quelli che... il Calcio, broadcast by Rai 3 and inspired by his previous show Forza Italia. The program, based on live commentary of Serie A soccer matches, strongly contributed making him popular in Italy. He presented the show until 2001, when he was replaced by Simona Ventura, after leaving the Italian public broadcaster. In 1997, he received the Premio Regia Tv for his show Anima mia, presented with Italian singer Claudio Baglioni. During the award ceremony, he also received the prize for Male TV Personality of the Year. In 1999, he presented the Sanremo Music Festival with virologist Nobel Prize-winner Renato Dulbecco and French actress and model Laetitia Casta. The following year, he was confirmed as the presenter of the singing competition. Other presenters of the show in 2000 were operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti, Italian actor Teo Teocoli and Spanish model In√©s Sastre. In 2001, he left RAI and signed a contract with the newborn private channel La7. On 24 June 2001, he appeared on the inaugural show of the network, together with Gad Lerner, Eros Ramazzotti and Pino Daniele. However, his first talk show for La7 was canceled a few days before its planned debut. Che tempo che fa and the shows with Roberto Saviano In 2003, Fazio started presenting the talk show Che tempo che fa, in which he interviews entertainers, politicians, artists and scientists. In November 2010, he presented Vieni via con me with Italian writer Roberto Saviano. The show was a big success, becoming the most watched show to be broadcast by Rai 3 in ten years. Despite this, the show was not confirmed for the following year, therefore Fazio and Saviano decided to move the program to La7, renaming it Quello che (non) ho. The show, consisting in three episodes, achieved an average share of 12.67%, with 2.9 million average viewers. Sanremo Music Festival In June 2012, RAI announced Fabio Fazio as the presenter of the 63rd Sanremo Music Festival. Luciana Littizzetto was later confirmed as the co-presenter of the show.

Farmer Mathias Schmidt donated the land for a Crabapple school, earning the privilege by running a footrace with neighbor Crockett Riley who had also offered to donate land. Area families built the native limestone structure with their own labor. The 1878 school had a single classroom, with an adjoining room for the teacher living quarters. An outer staircase led to a second story storage space. An additional room was added later. A second limestone school was built in 1882 that also served as a Lutheran church, until the St. John's congregation erected its own building in 1887. Twenty-eight teachers taught at Crabapple School before it consolidated with Fredericksburg Independent School District.

Early life and education Cornelia Cochrane Churchill Guest was born on November 28, 1963, in New York City, New York. Cornelia Guest is the daughter of Anglo-Irish polo champion Winston Guest (1906‚Äì1982) and socialite Lucy \\"C.Z.\\" Douglas Cochrane (1920-2003). She was the fourth and last child for Winston Guest and the second and last of C.Z. Guest‚Äôs children. Her godparents were her parents' friends, the former King Edward VIII, the Duke of Windsor (1894‚Äì1972), and his wife, Wallis Simpson (1896‚Äì1986). Guest attended Foxcroft School, but dropped out at 15 and completed her high-school diploma through a correspondence course. Guest became an accomplished equestrian, like her father, and rode competitively. She continued riding until her mother died in 2003. Debutante Years Cornelia made her debut in the winter of 1981-1982 at the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City. Her 18th birthday party included author Truman Capote (a childhood friend), Prince Egon von F√ºrstenberg (1946‚Äì2004), supermodel Cheryl Tiegs, John Bowes-Lyon who is Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs cousin, Andy Warhol (another childhood friend), make-up artist Way Bandy, heiress and philanthropist Doris Duke, and Jerry Zipkin, a socialite, escort, and confidante of First Lady Nancy Reagan, as guests. Capote, a Guest family friend, explained to People magazine why Guest‚Äôs soiree attracted so many celebrities, royals, and powerful people: \\"Cornelia has a No. 1 name. The Guests are from real patrician stock, unlike the Vanderbilts and Rockefellers, who are descended from crooks.\\" Guest was 1982‚Äôs Deb of the Year and was named the Deb of the Decade in 1986. The New York Times called her ‚Äúthe first ‚Äòcelebutante.‚Äô‚Äù As the newspaper noted at the time, ‚ÄúBefore her, debs were quiet about their ambitions. They aimed to mingle with the equally posh and then marry. Cornelia had different plans: she wanted to be an actress. ‚ÄòCornelia is some number,‚Äô her mother said when Cornelia had left New York for Hollywood. ‚ÄòShe is a star, and she wants to be a superstar.‚Äô‚Äù Guest was a constant presence in the society press and the national news throughout the decade ‚Äì including a photo shoot in which she appeared ‚Äútopless in Time magazine, her hands covering her breasts.‚Äù She appeared in Time, Life, People, New York magazine and The Washington Post. Some were critical of Guest‚Äôs flamboyance and self-promotion in particular and of the resurgence of debutante balls, with the lavish spending that comes with them, in general. Career Soon after the publication of her memoir, Guest headed to Hollywood for an acting career, quickly securing the services of both an agent and a much-in-demand acting coach, Sandra Seacat. Guest scored mostly small roles, beginning in 1989. In the early 2000s, she served as a spokeswoman for the upscale LaPrairie skin-care line. In 2013, Guest became a member of \\"Team Guy\\" on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. In 2017, she appeared in Twin Peaks.http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/cornelia-guest-plays-role-in- twin-peaks-on-showtime-1.13655946 Animal rights Guest is a vegan and has been a spokesperson for animal rights. Her line of upscale handbags for Bloomingdale's and 50 other stores includes no leather purses. In 2011, Guest posed nude as part of the ongoing ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go naked than wear fur‚Äù campaign for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). In August 2015, Guest became Brand Ambassador for Donna Salyers' Fabulous Furs, a Covington, Kentucky-based fashion house which specializes in faux fur clothing and products, and announced plans to release between five and ten designs through the company for the fall 2016 season. In January 2020, Guest moved to Dallas, Texas, to make a better home for the menagerie of animals she has rescued, including mini horses, donkeys, Guinea hens, a Sulcata tortoise, ducks, chickens, peacocks, cats, and dogs. Published works In 1986, she published a memoir, The Debutante‚Äôs Guide to Life. As part of the book tour for The Debutante‚Äôs Guide to Life, Guest crooned ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs My Party and I‚Äôll Cry If I Want To‚Äù on Late Night with David Letterman. In June 2012, Guest published a vegan cookbook and entertaining guide, Cornelia Guest's Simple Pleasures: Healthy Seasonal Cooking & Easy Entertaining. She also launched a vegan catering business in 2010.

On his return to Britain he became a director of the company and owned ¬£2,000 of shares. On return to England In 1697 his brother Francis acquired Danson Park and estate in Bexleyheath, Kent on his behalf, as well as 12 acres of marshland in Plumstead. Styleman began to develop Danson Park as a country seat, but his second wife Arabella died there in 1717, and he left the estate in 1723, letting it to John Selwyn MP on a 99-year lease. Styleman died in 1734. His will stipulated that proceeds from the lease of his property go towards supporting his fifth wife, Mary, and then at her death, half of the proceeds should go to building almshouses for the poor in Bexley. In 1761 the new owner of half of the estate, Sir John Boyd, attempted to acquire the half of the property willed to the charity in Styleman's will, by way of a permanent annuity of ¬£100, but an Act of Parliament was required to facilitate this arrangement.

When one of Shima's new acquaintances reveals a particularly nasty secret about one of the Fair's other attendees, events begin to spiral out of control, as Leet's thirst for vengeance becomes a burning hunger with a surprising target.

Biography  Prime Minister S√°nchez Guerra (left) with Gen. Jos√© Olaguer Feli√∫ (right), appointed as the new Spanish Minister of War in March 1922. Olaguer Feli√∫ was born on October 25, 1857 in Manila, but both parents were Spanish of Catalan origin. In 1876 he entered the Academy of the General Staff. In 1882 he was promoted to lieutenant and served in different places in Spain. In 1890 he went to the Philippines with the rank of commandant. He was director of the School of Arts and Crafts in Manila. Olaguer Feli√∫ took an active part in numerous military operations during the Philippines Campaign. He participated in the Battle of Kakarong de Sili in the island of Luzon on January 1, 1897, where the Commandant Olaguer Feliu achieved victory with only 600 men against 6.000 indigenous fighters katipuneros. As a result he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was awarded the prestigious Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand. Feli√∫ was then appointed as Chief of Staff to the Commanding Officer of Luzon. A year later he was promoted to the rank of colonel in recognition of his performance in operations in the province of Zambales. Following the outbreak of the war with the United States, Olaguer Feli√∫ remained in Manila where he performed distinguished services during the siege and blockade during the Battle of Manila. As Deputy Chief of Staff of the Captaincy General of Manila, Olaguer Feli√∫ was one of the senior officers who participated in the surrender of the city. In 1898 he returned to mainland Spain with the rank of Colonel and in 1902 was appointed as chief of staff of the Captaincy General of Galicia. In 1910 he was promoted to the rank of Brigade General and was appointed as Chief of Staff of the Second Region, a position he held until 1915. Then he was promoted to divisional general and given command of the Second Division. In 1912 Brigadier-General Feli√∫ was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Military Merit. In 1916 he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Royal and Military Order of San Hermenegildo. In 1917 he was appointed Military Governor of C√°diz, taking up command of the Ninth Division the same year. In 1918 Olaguer Feli√∫ was received as an academic member of the Royal Hispanic-American Academy of Cadiz. In 1921 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general and assumed the command of the Captaincy General of Catalonia until 1922, where he was replaced by Lieutenant General Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella In March 1922, Lieutenant-General Jose Olaguer Feli√∫ was appointed as Minister of War by Jos√© S√°nchez Guerra, Prime Minister of Spain. Olaguer Feli√∫ occupied the position of Minister of War during one of the most difficult and turbulent periods in modern Spanish military and political history: firstly the Moroccan campaign exacerbated by the hesitation of the government, after the events of the Disaster of Annual in July 1921; and on the other hand the actions of the military defenses boards (political juntas organised amongst the officer corps of the Spanish Army). All of these occurred in the middle of intense press and parliamentary debate about the report known as the Expediente Picasso (concerning responsibility for the Annual disaster). He resigned in July 1922. Then he was appointed Captain General of the Fifth Region of Aragon. In August 1923 Olaguer Feli√∫ became Director General of Carabineros of Spain, where he improved the service conditions of the personnel of this frontier guard/customs force. Amongst other reforms he reduced the daily working hours to twelve hours. He organised the expansion and improvement of the Colleges of the Carabineros (training academy). Feli√∫ arranged for the repair of existing barracks asd well as the construction of new buildings; as well as the creation of schools for the children of Carabineros. These improvements were undertaken at a time of budgetary constraints imposed by the Government, in spite of opposition from within both the Carabineros and Army hierarchy. Finally He increased the number of vacancies in the Alfonso XIII Orphans College of El Escorial and tripled the number of orphan students in the Pastoras Sisters College of Madrid. In 1924 he was awarded the Grand Cross of Christ by the Government of Portugal. On 14 December 1925 he was appointed as a member of the Army Review Board for Generals, Colonels (Junta Classificadora de Ascensos de Generales, Coroneles y asimilados del Ej√©rcito in Spanish). In 1927 Olaguer Feli√∫ was elected as State Representative and as Representative of National Life Activities, for the National Consultative Assembly, remaining in this position until 1928. In 1927 by order of His Majesty the King, Lieutenant General Jos√© Olaguer Feli√∫ retired as Director General of Carabineros and passed into the first reserve. On November 21 1929 Olaguer Feli√∫ died in Madrid.

He was a law partner of United States Senator William K. Sebastian before the war and of Confederate brigadier general and Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite of Freemasons Southern Jurisdiction, Albert Pike, after the war.

In 1819, the Adams family moved to New Albany, Indiana, where Charles was a clerk in a mercantile house between 1830 and 1835. Adams moved to Helena, Arkansas in 1835 and became a cashier in a mercantile house. In 1837, he became cashier of the Real Estate Bank of Arkansas. After studying law at night, he became a lawyer in 1839.Hallum, 1887, p. 308 In the early 1840s, Adams entered into a law partnership with William K. Sebastian, who became a United States Senator in 1848. Adams was a judge from 1852 to 1854. He also became a large cotton planter and slaveholder. Adams married Lucy Helen Everett. Their daughter Catherine Everett Keller was the mother of Helen Keller.Lash, Joseph P. Helen and Teacher: The Story of Helen Keller and Anne Sullivan Macy. New York: Delacorte Press, 1980. . Retrieved December 22, 2012. . p. 45. Adams was a presidential elector for John Bell in 1860.Hallum, 1887, p. 309 He was elected to the Arkansas secession convention in 1861 and vigorously advocated for secession of that state from the union.Hallum, 1887, p. 310. American Civil War service In 1861, Charles W. Adams first served the Confederacy as a major and quartermaster of Arkansas state troops under Brigadier General Thomas Bradley, soon succeeded by Major General James Yell.Hallum, 1887, p. 312. The Provisional Army of Arkansas was dissolved and incorporated into the Confederate States Army later in 1861. Adams then raised an infantry regiment, the 23rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment from the Helena, Arkansas area.Eicher, 2001, p. 587 notes that this regiment was also known as the 21st Arkansas Infantry Regiment. Adams was elected colonel on April 25, 1862. The regiment joined the Army of Tennessee after the Battle of Shiloh. After a few months, Adams returned to Arkansas to take charge of a new regiment. Except for two companies of veterans, they were mainly unwilling conscripts. The men were mustered into service on September 12, 1862. The regiment became known as Adams' Arkansas Infantry Regiment.As noted in the Adams' Arkansas Infantry Regiment article, the regiment was officially designated by the state military board as the 3rd Regiment, Northwest Division, District of Arkansas. There were two other Arkansas infantry regiments that were designated as the 3rd Arkansas during the Civil War: the 3rd Arkansas Infantry Regiment, assigned to the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia and the 3rd Arkansas State Troops. At the Battle of Prairie Grove, Arkansas on December 7, 1862, Adams's regiment was ordered forward after the battle had started, to fill a gap in the Confederate line.Shea, William L. Fields of Blood: The Prairie Grove Campaign. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2009. . p. 188. They headed directly for the sound of the firing, lost their way and ended up in a deep ravine from which they had to be extracted to take their place in the line. Adams kept his men in place for a short time in order to steady them. Soon, they unleashed a volley on the flank of an advancing Union regiment, the 26th Regiment Indiana Infantry, sending that regiment into retreat. As the Confederates advanced in close ranks, the 37th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment made a stand in an orchard, from which they brought Adams's regiment under heavy fire.Shea, 2009, p. 191. Most of the men, except for some veterans of the Battle of Wilson's Creek in the two veteran companies, then fled the field. Adams was nonetheless praised for his own leadership and performance.Adams in turn especially praised Major James H. Williams and Acting Color Sergeant John Howerton. Shea, 2009, pp. 320, 191. Adams and his remaining men fell in with Colonel Emmett MacDonald's Brigade of Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke's Division. The flight of most of the men of Adams's regiment had little effect on the outcome of the battle. Adams's regiment was disbanded on December 16, 1862. Adams then served on the staff of fellow Arkansas citizen Major General Thomas C. Hindman, who commanded a division in the Army of Tennessee.Hallum, 1887, p. 312. Adams served as acting assistant inspector general and chief of staff of the division.Eicher. 2001, p. 587, shows his tenure only as between October 6, 1862 and March 4, 1863 and describes the post as being in the District of Arkansas, Trans-Mississippi Department. This is not in line with Allardice or Hallum who show Adams serving with Hindman until December 1863. In his 1887 history of Arkansas, John Hallum says that Adams won a brigadier general commission for his gallantry on the field at the Battle of Missionary Ridge, November 25, 1863. Historian Bruce S. Allardice wrote in 1995 that \\"no record of Adams' promotion exists.\\"Allardice, 1995, p. 16. Adams returned to Arkansas in December 1863. In 1864, Adams served as commander of the Northern Sub-District of Arkansas, which was behind Union lines. Some sources show his rank as \\"acting brigadier general.\\" Confederate cavalry Brigadier General Joseph O. Shelby and his adjutant, Major John Newman Edwards each held a low opinion of Adams. Edwards accused Adams of being more interested in cotton trading than in fighting. When Shelby operated in this area of Arkansas, he relegated Adams to handling only civil matters. Adams remained in command until at least December 27, 1864. He likely formally remained on duty until the end of the war.Hallum 1887, p. 312 says Adams served until the end of the war. Later life Adams briefly returned to Helena, Arkansas after the war. He attempted to practice law but the local federal military authorities would not permit him to do so because he refused to take the Ironclad oath. Later in 1865, Adams moved to Memphis, Tennessee. There he opened a law practice with former Confederate brigadier general and prominent Freemason, Albert Pike.Eicher, 2001, p. 429.Pike moved to Washington, DC in 1868 or 1869. Hubbell, Jay B. The South in American Literature 1607-1900. Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1954. . . p. 647. Hallum, 1887, p. 312 says that Pike made the move to Washington in 1869. Charles William Adams died on September 9, 1878 of yellow fever at Memphis, Tennessee.Hallum, 1887, p. 313.Eicher, 2001, p. 587 gives his date of death as September 10, 1878. He is buried in Elmwood Cemetery, in Memphis. Charles W. Adams was the maternal grandfather of the author, political activist, disabilities advocate and lecturer Helen Adams Keller, who overcame deafblindness to achieve her many accomplishments.

However, Western civilization in its more strictly defined sphere traces its roots back to Rome and the Western Mediterranean. It can be strongly associated with nations linked to the former Western Roman Empire and with Medieval Western Christendom. The civilizations of Classical Greece (Hellenic) and Roman Empire (Latin) as well as Ancient Israel (Hebraism)Cambridge University Historical Series, An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects, p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era. and early Christendom are considered seminal periods in Western history;Caltron J.H Hayas, Christianity and Western Civilization (1953), Stanford University Press, p.2: That certain distinctive features of our Western civilization ‚Äî the civilization of western Europe and of America‚Äî have been shaped chiefly by Judaeo‚ÄìGraeco‚ÄìChristianity, Catholic and Protestant.Horst Hutter, University of New York, Shaping the Future: Nietzsche's New Regime of the Soul And Its Ascetic Practices (2004), p.111:three mighty founders of Western culture, namely Socrates, Jesus, and Plato.Fred Reinhard Dallmayr, Dialogue Among Civilizations: Some Exemplary Voices (2004), p.22: Western civilization is also sometimes described as \\"Christian\\" or \\"Judaeo- Christian\\" civilization.. From Ancient Greece sprang belief in democracy, and the pursuit of intellectual inquiry into such subjects as truth and beauty; from Rome came lessons in government administration, martial organization, engineering and law; and from Ancient Israel sprang Christianity with its ideals of the brotherhood of humanity. Strong cultural contributions also emerged from the pagan Germanic, Celtic, Wendic, Finnic, Baltic and Nordic peoples of pre-Christian Europe. Following the 5th-century \\"Fall of Rome\\", Europe entered the Middle Ages, during which period the Catholic Church filled the power vacuum left in the West by the fallen Roman Empire, while the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) endured for centuries. fresco found at the Minoan site of Knossos, indicating a sport or ritual of \\"bull leaping\\". The Minoan civilization was a Bronze Age civilization that arose on the island of Crete and flourished from approximately the 27th century BC to the 15th century BC. The Parthenon, located on the Acropolis in Athens, one of the cradles of Western civilization. Origins of the notion of \\"East\\" and \\"West\\" The opposition of a European \\"West\\" to an Asiatic \\"East\\" has its roots in Classical Antiquity, with the Persian Wars where the Greek city states (depicted as the west were opposing the expansion of the Achaemenid Empire (depicted as the east). The Biblical opposition of Israel and Assyria from a European perspective was recast into these terms by early Christian authors such as Jerome, who compared it to the \\"barbarian\\" invasions of his own time (see also Assyria and Germany in Anglo-Israelism). The \\"East\\" in the Hellenistic period was the Seleucid Empire, with Greek influence stretching as far as Bactria and India, besides Scythia in the Pontic steppe to the north. In this period, there was significant cultural contact between the Mediterranean and the East, giving rise to syncretisms like Greco-Buddhism. The establishment of the Byzantine Empire around the 4th century established a political division of Europe into East and West and laid the foundations for divergent cultural directions, confirmed centuries later with the Great Schism between Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholic Christianity. The Mediterranean and the Ancient West The earliest civilizations which influenced the development of the West were those of Mesopotamia, the area of the Tigris‚ÄìEuphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey and southwestern Iran: the cradle of civilization. An agricultural revolution began here around 10,000 years ago with the domestication of animals like sheep and goats and the appearance of new wheat hybrids, notably bread wheat, at the completion of the last Ice Age, which allowed for a transition from nomadism to village settlements and then cities like Jericho.Jacob Bronowski; The Ascent of Man; Angus & Robertson, 1973 The Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians and Assyrians all flourished in this region. Soon after the Sumerian civilization began, the Nile River valley of ancient Egypt was unified under the Pharaohs in the 4th millennium BC, and civilization quickly spread through the Fertile Crescent to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea and throughout the Levant. The Phoenicians, Israelites and others later built important states in this region. The ancient peoples of the Mediterranean heavily influenced the origins of Western civilisation. The Mediterranean Sea provided reliable shipping routes linking Asia, Africa and Europe along which political and religious ideas could be traded along with raw materials such as timber, copper, tin, gold and silver as well as agricultural produce and necessities such as wine, olive oil, grain and livestock. By 3100 BC, the Egyptians were employing sails on boats on the Nile River and the subsequent development of the technology, coupled with knowledge of the wind and stars allowed naval powers such as the Phoenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans to navigate long distances and control large areas by commanding the sea. Cargo galleys often also employed slave oarsmen to power their ships and slavery was an important feature of the ancient Western economy.Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004 Thus, the great ancient capitals were linked ‚Äî cities such as: Athens, home to Athenian democracy, and the Greek philosophers Aristotle, Plato and Socrates; the city of Jerusalem, the Jewish capital, where Jesus of Nazareth preached and was executed around AD 30; and the city of Rome, which gave rise to the Roman Empire which encompassed much of Europe and the Mediterranean. Knowledge of Greek, Roman and Judeo-Christian influence on the development of Western civilization is well documented because it attached to literate cultures, however, Western history was also strongly influenced by less literate groups such as the Germanic, Scandinavian and Celtic peoples who lived in Western and Northern Europe beyond the borders of the Roman world. Nevertheless, the Mediterranean was the centre of power and creativity in the development of ancient Western civilisation. Around 1500 BC, metallurgists learned to smelt iron ore, and by around 800BC, iron tools and weapons were common along the Aegean Sea, representing a major advance for warfare, agriculture and crafts in Greece. The Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle in The School of Athens by Raphael. The earliest urban civilizations of Europe belong to the Bronze Age Minoans of Crete and Mycenaean Greece, which ended around the 11th century BC as Greece entered the Greek Dark Ages.https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A765146-54 Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the Archaic period of the 8th to 6th centuries BC to 146 BC and the Roman conquest of Greece after the Battle of Corinth. Classical Greece flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Under Athenian leadership, Greece successfully repelled the military threat of Persian invasion at the battles of Marathon and Thermopylae. The Athenian Golden Age ended with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 404 BC. By the 6th century BC, Greek colonists had spread far and wide ‚Äî from the Russian Black Sea coast to the Spanish Mediterranean and through modern Italy, North Africa, Crete, Cyprus and Turkey. The Ancient Olympic Games are said to have begun in 776 BC and grew to be a major cultural event for the citizens of the Greek diaspora, who met every four years to compete in such sporting events as running, throwing, wrestling and chariot driving. Trade flourished and by 670 BC the barter economy was being replaced by a money economy, with Greeks minting coins in such places as the island of Aegina. Poultry arrived from India around 600 BC and would grow to be a European staple. The Hippocratic Oath, historically taken by doctors swearing to practice medicine ethically, is said to have been written by the Greek Hippocrates, often regarded as the father of western medicine, in Ionic Greek (late 5th century BC),The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation By Ludwig Edelstein Page 56 (1943) The Greek city states competed and warred with each other, with Athens rising to be the most impressive. Learning from the Egyptians, Athenian art and architecture shone from 520 to 420 BC and the city completed the Parthenon around 447 BC to house a statue of their city goddess Athena. The Athenians also experimented with democracy. Property owners assembled almost weekly to make speeches and instruct their temporary rulers: a council of 500, chosen by lot or lottery, whose members could only serve a total of 2 years in a lifetime, and a smaller, high council from whom one man was selected by lottery to preside from sunset to the following sunset. Tragic Comic Masks of Ancient leftThus, the citizens' assembly shared power and prevented lifetime rulers from taking control. Military chiefs were exempt from the short term requirement however and were elected, rather than chosen by lot. Eloquent oratory became a Greek art form as speakers sought to sway large crowds of voters. Athenians believed in 'democracy' but not in equality and excluded women, slaves, the poor and foreigners from the assembly. Notions of a general \\"brotherhood of man\\" were yet to emerge. Ancient Greek philosophy arose in the 6th century BC and continued through the Hellenistic period, at which point Ancient Greece was incorporated into the Roman Empire. It dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, ethics, metaphysics, ontology, logic, biology, rhetoric, and aesthetics. Plato was a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician and writer of philosophical dialogues. He was the founder of the Academy in Athens which was the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Inspired by the admonition of his mentor, Socrates, prior to his unjust execution that \\"the unexamined life is not worth living\\", Plato and his student, the political scientist Aristotle, helped lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science. Plato's sophistication as a writer is evident in his Socratic dialogues. In classical tradition, Homer is the ancient Greek epic poet, author of the Iliad, the Odyssey and other works. Homer's epics stand at the beginning of the western canon of literature, exerting enormous influence on the history of fiction and literature in general. Alexander the Great Alexander the Great (356 BC-323 BC) was a Greek king of Macedon and the creator of one of the largest empires in ancient history. He was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle and, as ruler, broke the power of Persia, overthrew the Persian king Darius III and conquered the Persian Empire. His Macedonian Empire stretched from the Adriatic sea to the Indus river. He died in Babylon in 323 BC and his empire did not long survive his death. Nevertheless, the settlement of Greek colonists around the region had long lasting consequences and Alexander features prominently in Western history and mythology.Yenne, W. Alexander the Great: Lessons from History's Undefeated General. Palmgrave McMillan, 2010. 244 p. The city of Alexandria in Egypt, which bears his name and was founded in 330 BC, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of the Western World. The city hosted such leading lights as the mathematician Euclid and anatomist Herophilus; constructed the great Library of Alexandria; and translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek (called the Septuagint for it was the work of 70 translators). The ancient Greeks excelled in engineering, science, logic, politics and medicine. Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe, for which reason Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.Richard Tarnas, The Passion of the Western Mind (New York: Ballantine Books, 1991).Colin Hynson, Ancient Greece (Milwaukee: World Almanac Library, 2006), 4.Carol G. Thomas, Paths from Ancient Greece (Leiden, Netherlands: E. J. Brill, 1988). Ancient Rome was a civilization that grew out of a small agricultural community, founded on the River Tiber, on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 10th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea, and centered at the city of Rome, the Roman Empire became one of the largest empires in the ancient world.Chris Scarre, The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Rome (London: Penguin Books, 1995). In its centuries of existence, Roman civilization shifted from a monarchy to an oligarchic republic to an increasingly autocratic empire. It came to dominate South-Western Europe, South-Eastern Europe/the Balkans and the Mediterranean region through conquest and assimilation. left Originally ruled by Kings who ruled the settlement and a small area of land nearby, the Romans established a republic in 509BC that would last for five centuries. Initially a small number of families shared power, later representative assemblies and elected leaders ruled. Rome remained a minor power on the Italian peninsula, but found a talent for producing soldiers and sailors and, after subduing the Sabines, Etruscans and Piceni began to challenge the power Carthage. By 240BC, Rome controlled the formerly Greek controlled island of Sicily. Following the 207 BC defeat of the bold Carthaginian general Hannibal, who had led an army spearheaded by war elephants over the Alps into Italy, the Romans were able to expand their overseas empire into North Africa. Roman engineers built arterial roads throughout their empire, beginning with the Appian Way through Italy in 312 BC. Along such roads marched soldiers, merchants, slaves and citizens to all corners of a flourishing mercantile empire. Roman engineering was so formidable that roads, bridges and aqueducts survive in impressive scale and quantity to the present day. According to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, the population of the Imperial capital was probably the first in the world to approach one million people. It eventually consisted of monumental public buildings, such as the Colosseum (dedicated to sport), the bathhouses (dedicated to leisure) and the Roman Forum dedicated to civic affairs. Slavery helped power the economy, but also created occasional tension ‚Äî as in the slave rebellion led by Spartacus which was put down in 71BC. Augustus, first emperor of Rome Julius Caesar (100 BC-44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman who played a critical role in the gradual transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. Conspirators who feared he was seeking to re-establish a monarchy assassinated him on the floor of the Roman Senate in 44 BC. His anointed successor Augustus Caesar outmaneuvered his opponents to reign as a de facto emperor from 27 BC. His successors became all-powerful and demanded veneration as gods. Rome entered its period of Imperial rule and stability (albeit often marred by occasional bouts of apparent insanity by various god- emperors) returned to the Empire. Roman civilization and history contributed greatly to the development of government, law, war, art, literature, architecture, technology, religion, and language in the Western world. Ecclesiastical Latin, the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world to the contemporary world but the Classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. It was, for many centuries, the international lingua franca and Latin itself evolved into the Romance languages, while Ancient Greek evolved into Modern Greek. Latin and Greek continue to influence English, not least in the specialised vocabularies of science, technology and the law. Judaism and the rise of Christendom Moses with the Ten Commandments as depicted by Rembrandt (1659) Madonna of Loreto by Raphael. Depictions of the infant Jesus with his mother, Mary, have been a major theme of Western art. The history of Judaism goes back 4000 years. The Hebrews were nomads who emerged from indigenous Canaanites and nearby deserts. The Hebrews (the name signified 'wanderer') formed one of the most enduring monotheistic religions, and the oldest to survive into the present day. Abraham is traditionally considered as the father of the Jewish people, and Moses the law giver, who led them out of slavery in Egypt and delivered them to the \\"Promised Land\\" of Israel. While the historicity of these accounts is not considered precise, the stories of the Hebrew Bible have been an inspiration for vast quantities of Western art, literature and scholarship. Depiction of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount by Carl Heinrich Bloch Around 1,000 BC, the Israelites had a period of power under King David who captured Jerusalem. His son King Solomon constructed the first magnificent Temple at Jerusalem for the worship of God. The Jews rejected the polytheism common to that age and would worship only Yahweh, whose Ten Commandments instructed them on morality. These Ten Commandments remain influential in the West and prohibited theft, lying and adultery; call for the worship of only one God; and for respect and honour for parents and neighbours. The Jews observed Sabbath as a \\"day of rest\\" (called \\"one of the first wide-ranging laws of social-welfare in the world\\" by the historian Geoffrey Blainey). In 587 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire of Nebuchadnezzar II destroyed the Temple and the Jewish leaders went into exile to return a century later to face a succession of foreign rulers: Persian and Greek. Judaism's texts, traditions and values play a major role in later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, Islam and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. Many aspects of Judaism have also influenced secular Western ethics and law.Jewish Contributions to Civilization: An Estimate (book) In 63 BC, Judea became part of the Roman Empire and around 6 BC Jesus was born to a Jewish family in the town of Nazareth, as a consequence of which, worship of the god of Israel would come to spread through, and later dominate, the Western World. Later the Western calendar would be divided into Before Christ (BC) (meaning before Jesus was born) and Anno Domini (AD). Christianity began as a sect within Judaism in the mid-1st century arising out of the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. The life of Jesus is recounted in the New Testament of the Bible, one of the bedrock texts of Western Civilization.BBC, BBC‚ÄîReligion & Ethics‚Äî566, Christianity According to the New Testament, Jesus was raised as the son of the Nazarenes Mary (called the \\"Blessed Virgin\\" and \\"Mother of God\\") and her husband Saint Joseph (a carpenter). Jesus' birth is commemorated during Christmas. Jesus learned the texts of the Hebrew Bible and like his contemporary John the Baptist, became an influential preacher. He gathered Twelve Disciples to assist in his work. He was a persuasive teller of parables and moral philosopher. In orations such as his Sermon on the Mount and stories such as The Good Samaritan and his declaration against hypocrisy \\"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\\", Jesus called on followers to worship God, act without violence or prejudice and care for the sick, hungry and poor. He criticized the privilege and hypocrisy of the religious establishment which drew the ire of religious and civil authorities, who persuaded the Roman Governor of the province of Judaea, Pontius Pilate, to have him executed for subversion. In Jerusalem, around AD 30 Jesus was crucified (nailed alive to a wooden cross) and died. According to the Bible, his body disappeared from his tomb three days later, because he had been resurrected from the dead. Easter celebrates this event. Saint Peter and Saint Paul by the artist El Greco Roman Emperor Constantine (centre) and the bishops of the First Council of Nicaea (325) holding the Niceno‚ÄìConstantinopolitan Creed of 381 The early followers of Jesus, including Saints Paul and Peter carried a new theology concerning him throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, sowing the seeds of such institutions as the Catholic Church, of which Saint Peter is remembered as the first Pope. Saint Paul, in particular, emphasised the universality of the faith and the religion moved beyond the Jewish population of the Empire and Asia Minor. Later Jesus was called \\"Christ\\" (meaning \\"anointed one\\" in Greek), and thus his followers became known as Christians. Christians often faced persecution from authorities or antagonistic populations during these early centuries, particularly for their refusal to join in worshiping the emperors. The Emperor Nero famously blamed them for the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64 and condemned them to Damnatio ad bestias, a form of capital punishment in which people were maimed to death by animals in the circus arena. Nevertheless, carried through the synagogues, merchants and missionaries across the known world, the new religion quickly grew in size and influence. Emperor Constantine's Edict of Milan in AD 313 ended the persecutions and his own conversion to Christianity was a significant turning point in history.Religion in the Roman Empire, Wiley-Blackwell, by James B. Rives, page 196 In AD 325, Constantine conferred the First Council of Nicaea to gain consensus and unity within Christianity, with a view to establishing it as the religion of the Empire. The council composed the Nicean Creed which outlined a profession of the Christian faith. Constantine instigated Sunday as Sabbath and \\"day of rest\\" for Roman society (though initially this was only for urban dwellers). The population and wealth of the Roman Empire had been shifting east, and the division of Europe into a Western (Latin) and an Eastern (Greek) part was prefigured in the division of the Empire by the Emperor Diocletian in AD 285. Around 330, Constantine established the city of Constantinople as a new imperial city which would be the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Possessed of mighty fortifications and architectural splendour, the city would stand for another thousand years as a \\"Roman Capital\\". The Hagia Sophia Cathedral (later converted to a mosque following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453) is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture, with its vast dome and interior of mosaics and marble pillars, it was so richly decorated that the Emperor Justinian, the last emperor to speak Latin as a first language, is said to have proclaimed upon its completion in 562: \\"Solomon, I have surpassed thee!\\". The city of Rome itself never regained supremacy and was sacked by the Visigoths in 410 and the Vandals in 455. Although cultural continuity and interchange would continue between these Eastern and Western Roman Empires, the history of Christianity and Western culture took divergent routes, with a final Great Schism separating Roman and Eastern Christianity in 1054. When the Western Roman Empire was starting to disintegrate, St Augustine was Bishop of Hippo Regius. He was a Latin-speaking philosopher and theologian who lived in the Roman Africa Province. His writings were very influential in the development of Western Christianity and he developed the concept of the Church as a spiritual City of God (in a book of the same name), distinct from the material Earthly City. His book Confessions, which outlines his sinful youth and conversion to Christianity, is widely considered to be the first autobiography written in the canon of Western Literature. Augustine profoundly influenced the coming medieval worldview. The fall of Rome In 476 the western Roman Empire, which had ruled modern-day Italy, France, Spain, Portugal and England for centuries, collapsed due to a combination of economic decline, and drastically reduced military strength which allowed invasion by barbarian tribes originating in southern Scandinavia and modern-day northern Germany. Historical opinion is divided as to the reasons for the fall of Rome, but the societal collapse encompassed both the gradual disintegration of the political, economic, military, and other social institutions of Rome as well as the barbarian invasions of Western Europe. In England, several Germanic tribes invaded, including the Angles and Saxons. In Gaul (modern-day France, Belgium and parts of Switzerland) and Germania Inferior (The Netherlands), the Franks settled, in Iberia the Visigoths invaded and Italy was conquered by the Ostrogoths. The slow decline of the Western Empire occurred over a period of roughly three centuries, culminating in 476, when Romulus Augustus, the last Emperor of the Western Roman Empire, was deposed by Odoacer, a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of this date,Arnaldo Momigliano, echoing the trope of the sound a tree falling in the forest, titled an article in 1973, \\"La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C.\\" (\\"The noiseless fall of an empire in AD 476\\"). and not simply because Julius Nepos, the legitimate emperor recognized by the East Roman Empire, continued to live in Salona, Dalmatia, until he was assassinated in 480. More importantly, the Ostrogoths who succeeded considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman traditions and, as the historian Edward Gibbon noted, the Eastern Roman Empire continued until the Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453.

There have been two referenda to extend Section 116 to states, but both failed.

The current situation, described as a \\"principle of state neutrality\\" rather than \\"separation of church and state\\", has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups.

It is located in the village of Skjerv√∏y on the island of Skjerv√∏ya. It is the main church for the Skjerv√∏y parish which is part of the Nord-Troms prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H√•logaland. The white, wooden church was built in 1728 to replace an older church building. It is the oldest preserved wooden church in the whole diocese, so it is a protected historic site. It was designed by the architect Hans Michelsen in a combination of the common long church style and cruciform style. The church seats about 225 people. History The Sami missionary Thomas von Westen started this church in the 1720s. He commissioned Hans Michelsen to build the church. The church was to serve the coastal Sami people and Kven people inhabiting the parish, which at that time encompassed most of Northern Troms county. In that time, attending church was required and if you were absent, you could be fined. Since the parish was so large, many small cabins were built near the shoreline by the church so that people could travel to the church on Saturday, stay over night there and then attend church on Sunday. This in effect made the churchyard a major community gathering center each week.

Because of their differing questions and rules, these referendums can be broken down into three time periods divided by what options were presented to voters. Under the Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act of 1893 The Alcoholic Liquors Sale Control Act, 1893 provided that at each general election voters would decide about the alcohol licensing regime. They would choose between 'licensing': the granting of more licenses, 'reduction', where no new licenses would be granted and 'prohibition' - a total ban on alcohol sales. For the prohibition option to pass it had to receive 60% of the valid votes, and if it failed to reach this threshold its vote total would be added to 'reduction'. Under this system, 'reduction' solidly won all six referendums between 1894 and 1908. Under the Licensing Amendment Acts of 1910 and 1918 The Licensing Amendment Act of 1910 changed the process above. Now voters would choose between 'licensing' and 'prohibition'. The option to permit licensing narrowly won both the 1911 and 1914 referendums held under this system. The Licensing Amendment Act of 1918 required another referendum before 30 April 1919. This referendum also stated that if prohibition was rejected, in future general elections voters would choose between 'licensing', a 'state monopoly' and 'prohibition'. In the plebiscite voters again narrowly chose licensing over prohibition, though prohibition had been winning until the votes of overseas soldiers (who were strongly in favor of licensing) were counted. After the 1919 referendum National Licensing polls were held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1984, except for 1931 and 1951. In 1919 two polls were held, on 10 April 1919 and 17 December 1919. After the failure of the 30 April 1919 referendum voters at each general election would choose between 'licensing', a 'state monopoly' and prohibition'. Because of the previous failures of prohibition in all referendums, the state monopoly and prohibition options required an absolute majority to pass, with licensing continuing unless that level was reached. In 1919, 1922 and 1925 no option reached a majority and so licensing continued by default. In 1928, licensing reached a majority of the vote for the first time. The vote share of licensing never again declined below a majority, and this option won all following referendums until the entire process was made moot by legal reforms in 1987. Local option polls from 1893 From 1893 to 1946 Local Option polls were held in each electorate, although \\"No-Licence\\" required a three-fifths (60%) majority, and also that half or more of those on the roll recorded a vote or the vote would be declared \\"void\\". Temperance advocates complained that their \\"democratic right\\" in those electorates with only a simple majority was denied. As general elections were usually held in October or November, electorates did not go ‚Äúdry‚Äù until the following year. In the went \\"dry\\", and in the and . In , and the poll was declared void.

MP John A. Lee who lost Auckland East in the by 37 votes blamed the adjustment for his loss.

Kimball, 1879 Charles Frederick Kimball (1831 - 1903) was a 19th-century American, pastoral landscape and marine painter, etcher and a master cabinet maker in Portland, Maine. Early life A native of Maine, Charles Frederick Kimball was born in Monmouth, Maine on October 31, 1831, the youngest of thirteen children, into a family of architects and builders.Ask Art Career He was largely self- taught. He showed local scenery paintings as early as 1853. He along with fellow landscape artist, John Bradley Hudson, Jr., shared a passion for painting en plein air, traveling around Casco Bay and Portland with their easels and brushes painting local scenery. It was these works that brought him notice. It showed his appreciation for the gentle shifts in the evening light. At this point in this career he was influenced by the Hudson River School. He studied with Portland artist, Charles Octavius Cole and John Greenleaf Cloudman. He was a member of the Brush'uns, a group of artists who went on sketching trips together. After gaining recognition as a gifted artist, Kimball quit painting professionally in 1863 to work as a stair builder and cabinet maker. He continued to paint as a hobby and his work found a wide regional audience. Despite his growing popularity, he did not want to commercialize his work. When he did sell a piece, it was through a small gallery or frame shop. After quitting the \\"professional scene\\", his style evolved under the influence of the French Barbizon school. Marriage In 1863 he married Annie Cloudman, daughter of John Greenleaf Cloudman, his mentor. He died in 1903. Legacy He was an active artist his whole life and a \\"champion of the arts\\" in the Portland area.Resource Library Magazine He was dedicated to maintaining the local art scene. In 1882 he played a major role in the founding of the Portland Society of Arts now the Portland Museum of Art. He served as its president from 1899 until his death in 1903. It was he and John Calvin Stevens who influenced Margaret Jane Mussey Sweat to leave the McLellan House, Portland, Maine to the Portland Art Society. The building has since become the society‚Äôs permanent home.

NeuroTribes Silberman's 2015 book NeuroTribes documents the origins and history of autism from a neurodiversity viewpoint. The book has received mostly positive reviews from both scientific and popular media. In a review published in Science-Based Medicine Harriet Hall, MD also known as The SkepDoc described Neurotribes as \\"the most complete history of autism I have seen\\" and recommends it as \\"a welcome ray of clarity, sanity, and optimism\\". In The New York Times Book Review, Jennifer Senior wrote that the book was \\"beautifully told, humanizing, important\\"; the Boston Globe called it \\"as emotionally resonant as any [book] this year\\"; and in Science, the cognitive neuroscientist Francesca Happ√© wrote, \\"It is a beautifully written and thoughtfully crafted book, a historical tour of autism, richly populated with fascinating and engaging characters, and a rallying call to respect difference.\\" It was named one of the best books of 2015 by The New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times, The Guardian, and many other outlets. Some other reviews were less positive, for example Dr. James C. Harris of Johns Hopkins University criticized Neurotribes as a book that pushes an agenda, saying that Silberman misrepresented Leo Kanner as somebody that had a negative view towards autistics and their parents, rather than, as Harris argued, an advocate for individualized treatment for every child. Dr. Manuel Casanova has also written against Silberman's perspective that Hans Asperger, one of the first autism researchers, should be forgiven for his involvement in the Nazi regime. \\"Contrary to Mr. Silberman,\\" Casanova wrote in response, \\"I do not defend or condone [Asperger‚Äôs] murderous actions.\\" Silberman has stated that a key point from the book is to recognize the need for accommodating autism as a significant disability in the same way that society accommodates people in wheelchairs.

This kind of historiography emerged in the early twentieth century among Korean intellectuals who wanted to foster national consciousness to achieve Korean independence from Japanese domination. Its first proponent was journalist and independence activist Shin Chaeho (1880‚Äì1936). In his polemical New Reading of History (Doksa Sillon), which was published in 1908 three years after Korea became a Japanese protectorate, Shin proclaimed that Korean history was the history of the Korean minjok, a distinct race descended from the god Dangun that had once controlled not only the Korean peninsula but also large parts of Manchuria. Nationalist historians made expansive claims to the territory of these ancient \\"Korean\\" kingdoms, by which the present state of the minjok was to be judged. Shin and other Korean intellectuals like Park Eun-sik (1859‚Äì1925) and Choe Nam-seon (1890‚Äì1957) continued to develop these themes in the 1910s and 1920s. They rejected two prior ways of representing the past: the Confucian historiography of Joseon Korea's scholar-bureaucrats, which they blamed for perpetuating a servile worldview centered around China, and Japanese colonial historiography, which portrayed Korea as historically dependent and culturally backward. The work of these prewar nationalist historians has shaped postwar historiography in both North and South Korea. Despite ideological differences between the two regimes, the dominant historiography in both countries since the 1960s has continued to reflect nationalist themes, and this common historical outlook is the basis for talks about Korean unification. In the process of trying to reject Japanese colonial scholarship, Korean nationalist historians have adopted many of its premises. Shin Chaeho's irredentist claims over Manchuria, however, have not made it into the mainstream.  Historical context  A Japanese depiction of the signing of the Ganghwa Treaty (1876) between Meiji Japan and Joseon Korea, which opened Korea to foreign trade. The late nineteenth century was a time of domestic crises and external threats for Joseon Korea (1392‚Äì1910). Starting in the 1860s, a series of rebellions caused by excessive taxation and misgovernment threatened the reigning dynasty, while foreign powers ‚Äî mostly western countries, but also Meiji Japan ‚Äî used military force to try to open Korea to trade., pp. 433 (rebellions starting in 1862) and 437 (military pressure from westen powers and Japan). The Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876 opened three Korean ports to commerce and granted Japanese merchants extraterritoriality in these ports.. This unequal treaty prompted even more foreign interventions, as it turned Korea into a target of rivalry between imperialist powers. (the 1876 treaty \\"opened the door not only to trade but to foreign interference and a world of trouble\\"); (\\"imperialist rivalry over Korea\\"). One crucial issue was whether Korea was a sovereign state or a Chinese dependency.. Despite Joseon's status as a tributary of Ming (1368‚Äì1644) and then Qing (1644‚Äì1911) China ‚Äî which implied the sending of tribute missions and a ritually inferior position of the Korean king vis-√†-vis the Chinese emperor ‚Äî Korea could also dictate both its domestic and foreign policies, creating an ambiguous situation that frustrated western powers. (tribute missions and ritual inferiority) and 37 (\\"like the Ming, the Qing virtually never interfered with Korean domestic affairs\\"; \\"dependent-yet- autonomous status\\"); (\\"One of the reasons for the use of violence by the French and Americans was the frustration caused by the ambiguity over who was responsible for the conduct of foreign relations under the tributary system\\"). To appease tensions, China and Japan signed the Convention of Tientsin (1882), in which both parties agreed not to send more troops to Korea. In 1884, however, Korean reformers supported by Japanese legation guards tried to depose King Gojong (r. 1863‚Äì1907), but Chinese troops stationed in Korea intervened quickly to foil the coup.. Ten years later, the Donghak Peasant Rebellion exploded and once again put the Joseon regime in difficulty. King Gojong asked China to send troops to help repress it, but Japan, pretexting that it wanted to protect its interests in the peninsula, sent even more. In July 1894 Japanese forces seized the Korean king and forced him to establish a cabinet that implemented extensive institutional reforms. One of these reforms consisted in establishing the Bureau of History (Pyeonsaguk Á∑®Âè≤Â±Ä), which would play a role in later controversies over history.. Japan's attack on Chinese forces a few days later started the Sino-Japanese War, which was fought over who would control the Korean peninsula.. The war ended with a resounding Japanese victory confirmed by the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895), which forced China to recognize the independence of Joseon Korea. But Korea's escape from the China-centered world order simply cleared the way for Japanese imperialist domination..  History of Korean nationalist historiography   Precursors (before 1895)  During the later half of the Joseon dynasty (1392‚Äì1897), many scholars became disenchanted with Sinocentrism and became more conscious of Korea's uniqueness and independence. This trend became known as the silhak (\\"pragmatic learning\\") movement. The most important pre-1895 precursor to the rise of nationalist historiography was the erosion of Sinocentrism during the silhak movement. Non-Sinocentric historiographical ideas began to arise in the works of the scholars Hong Tae-yong (1731‚Äì1783), Yi Chong-hwi (1731‚Äì1786), Park Ji-won (1737‚Äì1805), Yu Deuk-gong (1749‚Äì1807), Chong Yag-yong (1762‚Äì1836), and Yi Kyu-gy≈èng (, 1788‚Äì1856). Hong Tae-yong refuted the sacrosanct idea of Sinocentrism that China was superior to all other nations, and argued that all nations were equals. Hong's contemporary Chong Yag-yong argued that any nation excelling in culture could define itself as the \\"center\\", and further argued that because Korea has already reached this level of cultural development, it could therefore be called the \\"center\\". He also emphasized the importance of additional education in Korean texts such as Samguk Sagi (12th century) rather than the Chinese Classics alone. Park Ji-won lamented that the prevailing Korean historians of his day were beholden to Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucian framework, which placed China at the center of the international system. He provided a fresh perspective on the historical territory of Korea as extending beyond the Yalu river into Manchuria. Yi Kyu-gy≈èng appealed to intellectuals to write a comprehensive history of Korea within the interpretative framework of independent national identity. The most representative silhak historiographical work is Seongho Yi Ik's (1681‚Äì1763) Dongsa Gangmok (\\"Essentials of the History of the Eastern Country\\"), which although written in a neo-Confucian framework, demonstrates a more critical than apologetic tone towards the early Joseon dynasty and its establishment.  1895‚Äì1945  = 1895‚Äì1905 = Contemporary Korean historians trace the roots of nationalist historiography to the Korean independence movement, which emerged in response to the rise of Japanese influence in Korea after Japan's victory in the Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895). Starting in 1895, Korean newspapers started to foster new ways of imagining Korea. In 1896 Seo Jae-pil (1864‚Äì1951) and Yun Chi-ho (1864‚Äì1945) founded the bilingual (English-Korean) Tongnip Sinmun (the Independent), which was the first Korean newspaper to be published in Hangul. Seo and Yun, who had both come into contact with ideas of \\"nation\\" and \\"independence\\" during their studies in the United States, tried to promote national consciousness among Koreans, partly through historical education. In 1899 the newspaper translated into vernacular Korean an essay \\"On Patriotism\\" that Chinese journalist and historian Liang Qichao had recently published in Japan. But such calls for \\"Korean political unity and racial solidarity\\" in turn-of-the-century newspapers were censored by Japanese colonial authorities.. The Tongnip Sinmun was thus forced to close later in 1899. Japanese authorities also suppressed private schools that tried to promote patriotism through the teaching of Korean history, language, and customs.. Social Darwinist ideas of struggle between races were also among the new intellectual currents influencing Koreans at the time. They were introduced to Korea in the 1880s by intellectuals who had traveled or studied in Japan. Their first two proponents were Yu Kil-chun (1856‚Äì1914) and Yun Chi-ho (1864‚Äì1945), who had both been to Japan in the spring of 1881 as members of Eo Yun-jung's (Ïñ¥Ïú§Ï§ë, È≠öÂÖÅ‰∏≠; 1848‚Äì1896) Courtiers' Observation Mission (Ï°∞ÏÇ¨ ÏãúÏ∞∞Îã®, ÊúùÂ£´Ë¶ñÂØüÂúò), which the Korean royal court had dispatched to observe the Meiji reforms. Yun mentioned ideas on the Korean \\"race\\" in editorials published in Tongnip Sinmun, but not enough to disseminate these ideas widely. Indeed, until the imposition of a Japanese protectorate on Korea in 1905, the Pan- Asianist view that Koreans and Japanese, as members of the \\"yellow race,\\" were allies in a struggle against the \\"white race,\\" was more salient in Korean newspapers than portrayals of Koreans as racially distinct from the Japanese. = Japanese colonial historiography = Mainstream Japanese historiography arose out of a fusion of Western historiography, as introduced by the German Ludwig Riess in 1887, and the Chinese scholarly tradition of evidential research (kaozheng ËÄÉË≠â or k≈çsh≈çgaku ËÄÉË≠âÂ≠∏), which had established in Japan since the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868). Japanese historiography on East Asia (T≈çy≈çshi) was a field led by Shiratori Kurakichi ÁôΩÈ≥•Â∫´Âêâ (1865‚Äì1942) which generally followed the negative, orientalist portrayals of China and Korea by the West, while categorizing Japan as separate from both Asia and the West, but as on an equal footing with the West. What Korean historians refer to as Japanese \\"colonial historiography\\" can be traced to Tokyo Imperial University's 1890 history of Japan, the Kokushi gan ÂúãÂè≤Áúº, which argued for a common ancestry to Koreans and Japanese (Nissen d≈çso-ron). Based on the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles, the Kokushi gan asserted that the legendary figures Susanoo, the brother of Emperor Jimmu, and Empress Jing≈´ had ruled or invaded Silla (Korea). Such views of Korea's historical subjugation to Japan became widely accepted in Japanese scholarship, and integral to Japan's national history, as it was presented in other books of Japan's Meiji era (1868‚Äì1912), such as ≈åtori Keisuke's Ch≈çsen kibun ÊúùÈÆÆÁ¥ÄËÅû (1885), and Hayashi Taisuke's ÊûóÊ≥∞Ëºî Ch≈çsenshi ÊúùÈÆÆÂè≤ (1892), made similar arguments. Another theme in Japanese historical scholarship on Korea was Korea's backwardness, which was first argued by the economist Tokuz≈ç Fukuda in 1902, who said that Joseon was equivalent to Japan in the Heian period (794‚Äì1185). From the time of the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1876, the Empire of Japan became increasingly involved in Korean affairs. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 opened Manchuria (northeast China) to Japanese colonization, Japan began promoting the idea of a joint and inseparable \\"Manchurian-Korean history\\" (Mansenshi ÊªøÈÆÆÂè≤). In this theory of Manchurian-Korean history, developed by Inaba Iwakachi in the 1920s and 1930s, Korea was subjected to various forces of heteronomy in politics and economics, and thus lacked \\"independence and originality\\". Official imperial involvement in Korean historiography began in 1915, through the Chungch'uwon office. Sait≈ç Makoto, the Japanese Governor-General of Korea, targeted Korean ethnic nationalist historians (minjok sahakka) such as Shin Chae-ho, Choe Nam-seon, and Yi Kwang-su, as part of a \\"cultural containment\\" policy since the March 1st demonstrations for independence in 1919. The Governor-General's education office published a 35-volume work called Ch≈çsenjin, which argued that Koreans should be assimilated to Japan; Japanese intellectuals proposed refashoning Korean names to Japanese style to serve this end. In 1922, the Governor- General established a committee which compiled a 35-volume \\"History of Chos≈èn\\" (Chosenshi). The Chosenshi was mostly composed of extracts from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean historical sources, and was used as a primary source for historical works on Korea in the Japanese period. Japanese administrators also surveyed artifacts of historical value on the Korean Peninsula (koseki chosa jigyo Âè§ËπüË™øÊü•‰∫ãÊ•≠) and sought to disprove the popular belief in the Dangun figure of Korean culture. A popular portrayal of Koreans in Japanese historiography was that of the sadaejuui, or as being extremely servile to foreign powers, particularly China. = Shin Chaeho and Korean nationalist historiography = The polemicist Shin Chaeho (1880‚Äì1936) found both Confucian historiography and Japanese colonial scholarship unsatisfactory on political, rather than academic, grounds, and proposed instead the Korean \\"race\\" (minjok) as an alternative subject of analysis. Shin believed that Koreans of his time had a \\"slavish mentality\\" as a result of centuries of historical, political, and cultural dependence on China, and he prescribed as a cure an identification with the Korean nation and the state, so that this community could be goaded to collective political activism. In both North and South Korea, Shin Chaeho is credited as the first historian to make the Korean ethnicity the center of Korean historiography, the Koreanist Charles K. Armstrong notes that Shin is \\"considered the father of modern Korean historiography. He received a typical Confucian education, but left Joseon for China after the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty in 1910. Inspired by his visits to the Goguryeo ruins and Mount Baekdu (Changbai) on the Chinese side of the border, he published Korean nationalist tracts in exile until his death in 1936. Among the new intellectual currents influencing Koreans during Japanese rule, a version of Social Darwinism promulgated by the Chinese historian Liang Qichao was influential among nationalist journalist-historians like Shin Chaeho, Choe Nam-seon, and Park Eun-sik. Liang taught that the world was divided between peoples who were expansionist and influential, such as the Anglo-Saxons and Germans, and those peoples who were weak and insignificant. The themes of struggle for existence (saengj≈èn ky≈èngjaeng), survival of the fittest (yangyuk kangsik) and natural selection (ch'≈èntaek) inspired not only Shin's own historical views, but also those the Korean \\"self-strengthening movement\\" (chagang undong), which operated in similar terms to that in China and in Japan. Shin was also influenced by Liang's \\"Methods for the Study of Chinese History\\" (Zhongguo lishi yangjiufa, 1922), from which many of Shin's methods derive. He wrote his own history of Korea which broke from Confucian tradition, whose purveyors he decried as \\"effete\\" and disconnected from Korea's \\"manly\\" tradition going back to the ancient \\"Korean\\" expansionist kingdom of Goguryeo. Shin felt that Confucian historiography, and especially that of Kim Bu-sik and his alleged pro-Silla bias, suppressed a valid Korean claim to Manchurian territory, which not only had Goguryeo possessed, but Shin conceived as a central stage of Korean history, and a measure of the minjok's strength. Moreover, it was the act of writing history that caused Koreans not to rise up and conquer Manchuria again, according to Shin, resulting in a \\"great country becoming a small country, a great people becoming a small people\\". Yet he also criticized the shin sach'e textbooks after the Confucians, who nonetheless treated Japan sympathetically, translated Japanese historical works, and reflected the Japanese worldview. He also criticized Pan-Asianism as a guise for Japanese expansionism and regarded East Asia as a mere geographic unit, rather than a basis for solidarity. As a result, his new history focused on both \\"national struggle\\" rather than on the rise and fall of political dynasties, and emphasizing Korea's separateness from China and Japan, as he argued that historiography \\"should promote national spirit and independence\\". The fellow historians Park Eun-sik (1859‚Äì1925) and Chang Chi- y≈èng likewise attempted to rectify the \\"slave literary culture\\" (noyej≈èk munhwa sasang) of the yangban to reflect historical Korea's supposed martial tradition. After the Japanese annexation, some Korean intellectuals chose to retreat into a life of glorifying Korea's cultural expanse in the past, rather than active collaboration or open resistance with the new authorities. Choe Nam-seon, the founder of the Association for Korea's Glorious Literature (Chos≈èn Kwangmunhoe) and Park Eun-sik were representative of a new school of historians called the nationalist historians (Minjok sahakka), who bemoaned the decline of the Joseon dynasty and aimed to raise national consciousness to achieve Korean independence. Despite their designation as historians, many prominent figures in the movement did not have formal historical training, made extreme claims that \\"had little chance to withstand the rigorous test of objective historical criticism\\", and saw history as a political weapon to serve the aims of achieving Korean independence. Shin Chaeho often revised existing history and mythology to support his ideal of historical Korean autonomy, and where he could not find it, or where there were contradictions, blamed it on \\"lost\\" or \\"falsified\\" records, a technique which he accused Kim Bu-sik of. These historians preferred the folkloric Samguk Yusa as a source over the court-sanctioned Samguk Sagi, blaming the sagi's compiler for distorting Korean history to Confucian and sadaejuui (pro-China) ends. Choe's historical research, which he believed should not be unbiased, was motivated by the desire to refute Japanese kokugaku scholarship that emphasized those periods where Korea was under foreign domination. Among nationalist scholars, Shin chose to adapt techniques of that Japanese scholarship, including the use of the derogatory exonym Shina to debase China. An Hwak (ÂÆâÂªì), another Korean nationalist, inverted Japanese historiographical tropes, such as by arguing that the supposed factionalism of the late Joseon was an embryonic form of modern party politics. In 1914, Kim Kyo-h≈èn (ÈáëÊïôÁçª) wrote the first nationalist history of Korea, from Dangun to the late Joseon, called \\"A Popular History of the God Tan'gun\\" (Shindan minsa Á•ûÊ™ÄÊ∞ëÂè≤). Because of Japanese censorship, the writing of nationalist histories was conflated with anti-colonial resistance. Korean historians charge Japanese colonialist historiography of four main distortions: of giving a leading role to Chinese, Manchurian, and Japanese actors in the history of Korea (t'ayuls≈èngron); of portraying Korean society as stagnant and even pre-feudal (ch≈èngch'es≈èngron); of documenting factionalism within Korean political culture (tangp'as≈èng-ron); and of alleging common Korean and Japanese ancestry (ils≈èn tongjoron) in order to justify the Japanese colonization of Korea. Yi Ki-baek summarizes Japanese colonialist historiography as stemming from the assumptions of \\"stagnation, nondevelopment, peninsula particularism, and unoriginality\\". After Shin's death, historians who wrote in his tradition would be called \\"New Nationalists\\" (shin minjokchu≈≠i) of the \\"Korean Studies\\" movement. In the 1930s, alternative schools emerged, including Marxist historiography and a Western-based, scientific approach (Chindan hakhoe). The scholars from the Chindan hakhoe (Chindan Academic Society), including Yi Py≈èng-do, Yi Sang- baek, Kim Sang-gi, and Kim S≈èk-hy≈èng, were trained at universities in Japan or at Keij≈ç Imperial University in Seoul and published in Japanese journals, following objective Rankean ideas that challenged Japanese colonial historiography. On the other hand, the New Nationalists included figures such as Ch≈èng In-bo (ÈÑ≠ÂØÖÊôÆ) and An Chae-hong (ÂÆâÂú®È¥ª), the first of which had a classical Chinese education, rather than at a social science department at a university in Korea or Japan. They emphasized \\"independent self-spirit\\" (chashim), in contrast to neo-Confucian and Western-style scholarship, which represented for Ch≈èng a \\"dependent spirit (t'ashim).  After World War II  The surrender of Japan at the end of World War II handed Korea its independence, but the peninsula was immediately divided into ideologically opposed regimes in North and South Korea. At first, Marxist historians focusing on class analysis dominated historical writing in the north, whereas Syngman Rhee's staunchly anti-Communist government (1948‚Äì1960) also made the notion of minjok less central to historiography in the south.North: ; South: . In North Korea class analysis was displaced by nationalist analysis in the 1950s, soon after the Korean War.. In South Korea, the fall of the Rhee regime in 1960 and the anti-Japan protests triggered by the normalization of diplomatic ties with Japan in 1965 also reinstated the minjok as a \\"unifying framework\\" for developing an anti-colonial historiography.. Since then, historical studies in both North and South have displayed a \\"pervasive and intense nationalistic tone\\" despite ideological differences between the two countries.. This shared historical outlook has served as a backdrop to North Korea‚ÄìSouth Korea relations, as in June 2000 when both Korean heads of state stated that Korean unification was a historical imperative. = North Korea = After independence in 1945, the \\"far more militant\\" nationalist tone in North Korean historical scholarship, as compared to South Korean historiography, allows such scholarship to be categorized as nationalist, rather than Marxist. The North Korean leader Kim Il Sung commissioned historians as propagandists to glorify the ancient Goguryeo kingdom's feats against Tang Dynasty China, as well as the more recent anti-Japanese struggle in northeast China (Manchuria). Kim was part of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army led by the Communist Party of China, of which he was a member, but this history was later replaced with his unverifiable claim to have led a \\"Korean People's Revolutionary Army\\" (Chos≈èn inmin hy≈èngmy≈ènggun), the details of which strike a similarity to the Northeast Anti-Japanese People's Revolutionary Army which was led by a Chinese. North Korean history of Kim Il Sung's exploits in Manchurian exile contain omissions, implausibilities, and forgeries, as well as a subtext of wandering and salvation (of the minjok) that has been compared with Christian and Greek mythology. According to Gi- Wook Shin, Kim Jong Il's \\"blood-based nationalism\\" is descended from the ideas of the historians Shin Chaeho, Yi Kwang-su, and Choe Nam-seon. There are likewise similarities‚Äîalthough unacknowledged because of the Kim personality cult‚Äî between Kim's emphasis juche (chuch'e) self-reliance ideology and Shin's idea of \\"autonomous spirit\\" (chuch'e ≈≠i ch≈èngsin) and denigration of servile sadaejuui. It is also from these concepts where Inter-Korean charges and countercharges of \\"dependence\\" originate. The geographical location of Kim's government in northern Korea has helped it to promote nationalist histories featuring Goguryeo and other Manchurian states to shore up its own legitimacy. The most authoritative history in North Korea, the Chos≈èn t'ongsa (1977 edition) justifies its disproportionate treatment of Goguryeo, especially relative to the traditionally-venerated contemporaneous Silla, \\"because the Korean people were strongest under the [Goguryeo] rules\\". The Chos≈èn t'ongsa also challenges the traditional view of \\"Unified Silla\\" as having unified Korea, stating that the regime only \\"the southern part of the national land\\", and that by allying with Tang Dynasty China, it \\"brought in the foreign enemies and... committed a serious crime before the Korean people\\". As a result of the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War, it continues, Korea \\"lost no small amount of territory to the aggressors\\", referring to the lands occupied by Balhae after the collapse of Goguryeo, although North Korea considers Balhae to be Korean. Since the 1950s, North Korean historiography has abandoned class analysis in favor of nationalistic categories, in accordance with the leading juche ideology. Before then, North Korean scholarship concerned itself with fitting Marxist historiography to Korean history, but in 1966, the North Korean dean of historians deemed one controversy on how to reconcile Marxist historiography with national history as a task more relevant to Slavs and Germans than to Koreans. North Korean historiography began to take a more nationalistic aspects and took Manchuria as its geographical center; and important historical controversies began to be settled without debate or discussion. In contrast to the Communist Manifesto, which begins \\"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles\\", a standard North Korean history text reads, \\"Human history is a history of struggle of the people for Chajus≈èng [autonomy or independence]\\". According to Charles K. Armstrong, this conception of history is more similar to Shin Chaeho's conception of the \\"I\\" versus the \\"non-I\\" than to Marxism. This history writing denied the influences of Chinese civilization on Korea, and called for a correction of ancient Korean history based on the juche ideology of self-reliance. North Korean historiography on modern Korea has mostly featured unverifiable claims about the heroic nationalist acts of the Kim Il- sung family, such as that one of Kim's ancestors led a mob to burn an American naval ship in 1866. In North Korean historiography, this attack marks the beginning of Korean modern history (k≈≠ndaesa). Mount Baekdu, which is almost always juxtaposed with Kim's son Kim Jong Il, has been increasingly featured in North Korean \\"mythography\\" since the 1960s, and more rapidly since the 1970s, associating the leader with Dangun, the supposed progenitor of the Korean race. However, it has also been used to praise the silhak reformist Ch≈èng Tasan as a patriot in the North, because Tasan wanted to end Joseon's participation in the Imperial Chinese tributary system. Tasan himself was an advocate of an advocate of a \\"people-oriented\\" (minbon) theory of history. A 1970 speech by Kim's son Kim Jong Il to the Workers' Party of Korea emphasized that \\"we should ensure that things of the past are shown or taught to our people so as to contribute to their education in socialist patriotism\\" (sahoe chu≈≠i ch≈èk aeguk chu≈≠i). = South Korea = Korean nationalist historiography has dominated the field of Korean studies in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) since 1945. From 1945 to the late 1960s, South Korean national historiography began to move away from biographies of heroic figures in the Korean independence movement towards analyzing nationalist incidents such as the March 1st Movement. Still, South Korean nationalist historiography aims to refute what historian Lee Ki-baek called a \\"colonial view of Korean history\\", to which Japanese and foreign scholars supposedly still subscribed. One such \\"colonial view\\" was that the Goryeo dynasty (918‚Äì1392) was stagnant, which nationalist historians studied Goryeo institutions to try to refute with evidence of dynamism and change. But there are more than twice the number of articles and monographs on the Joseon than there are for Goryeo, since South Korean historians assume that there was a potential fundamental, irreversible change from traditionalism to modernism during that time. This change, so say historians like Choe Y≈èng-h≈≠i, which inhibited by the various Japanese invasions from the 16th century and ultimate annexation, which they blame for social instability and armed banditry. Kim Chol-choon, writing in 1970, evaluated the state of South Korean historiography as lacking a \\"critical spirit\\". In 1978, nationalist historian Kang Man'gil challenged the existing periodization of South Korean history into \\"colonial\\" and \\"postliberation\\" blocs, instead suggesting that the second half of the 20th century should be characterized as one of \\"division\\", preceding the creation of a unified, ethnic Korean state. His attack on the \\"colonial\\" Korean historiography proposed a new \\"self-determining historiography\\" (chuch'ej≈èk sagwan). Since the 1970s, fringe elements in the South Korean historical community have also tried to resurrect Shin's irredentist focus on Manchuria. The normalization of China‚ÄìSouth Korea relations and visits to Koreans in China have increased interest in the region, although efforts at \\"Recovering the Ancient Lands\\", as one irredentist author puts it, are marginal in the public sphere. The official History of the Republic of Korea portrayed the Korean people as center-stage in their own \\"liberation\\" against a small number of collaborators, giving the Allies of World War II a peripheral role. Authoritarian governments in South Korea interfered heavily in historical scholarship, \\"aggravat[ing] the traditionally conformist nature of established scholarship\\" by making such topics as the popularity of Communism in 1930s and 1940s Korea taboo. Since the democratization of South Korea in 1987, scholars continue to publish nationalist histories, and the hegemonic portrayal of Japanese rule as oppressive to Korean culture has not changed, although a few Korean scholars have questioned the \\"collaboration-resistance\\" dichotomy. From the 1980s to Kim Dae-jung's presidency in 1998, most South Korean historians of collaborationism agreed with the idea that \\"the nation's history was kidnapped\\" at independence \\"by a clique of pro-Japanese stooges\\", who were shielded by the United States Army Military Government in Korea and Syngman Rhee from the Anti-Traitors Investigation Committee. Recent political campaigns such as the establishment of a Presidential commission in 2005 to identify and shame collaborators have entrenched national history as the dominant form of historiography. The state retains the most powerful purveyor of historical memory in South Korea, launching for example a campaign in 2010 to \\"remember with the people the proud history of establishing simultaneously national sovereignty, democracy and economic development, something unique in the world\\", a self-legitimizing narrative that excludes the history of the Korean War and Korean democracy activists against the South Korean state. However, some historians of the South Korean New Right, such as Lee Young- hoon, are challenging the nation-centered history by proposing a state- centered history which promotes patriotic pride (aegukshim, ) for South Korea's economic accomplishments rather than shame for the failure of unifying Koreans. Im Chihy≈èn is another contemporary advocate, though of different ideological background, for the \\"democratization\\" (minjuhwa ) of historiography by its liberation from the \\"monolithic nation\\" paradigm. He is critical, however, of South Korea's democratic governments' efforts to reconcile (kwag≈è ch‚Äô≈èngsan) the state's past of White Terror. Postcolonial South Korean nationalist historians also sought to divide Koreans during the Japanese administration into categories of self-serving collaborator or self- sacrificing nationalist resisters. The first major challenge to the hegemonic state-endorsed, nationalist historiography came not from a Korean but from the American Bruce Cumings, who wrote the 1981 book Origins of the Korean War. Cumings recalled facing heavy resistance to his revisionist historiography including, \\"that the mere mention of the idea that Japan somehow 'modernized' Korea calls forth indignant denials, raw emotions, and the sense of mayhem having just been, or about to be committed.\\"  Themes  The writings of Shin Chaeho outlined the themes for later nationalist historiography, including the ancientness and distinctiveness of Koreans; the long history of Koreans warding off \\"foreign aggression\\"; and the portrayal of Koreans \\"as an essential part of world history\\".  The Korean minjok  The main goal of Korean nationalist historiography (minjok sahak) in South Korea since 1945 was to write \\"a new racial history of Korean independence\\" that would refute earlier Japanese scholarship on Korea (Ilchesagwan). The idea of a Korean race, or people, entered into Korean vocabulary in the late 1890s with the word minjok. Prior to the 19th century, according to Carter Eckert, \\"there was little, if any, feeling of loyalty toward the abstract concept of 'Korea' as a nation-state, or toward fellow inhabitants of the peninsula as 'Koreans'\\". Loyalty to village, family, and king took precedence for ordinary people, while Korean elites considered themselves as members of a \\"cosmopolitan civilization centered on China\\". The coming of the nation state system to East Asia, during which Korea was corporated into Meiji Japan, prompted Korean activists to \\"redefine Korea in terms of internal homogeneity and external autonomy\\". In Shin Chaeho's 1908 essay Doksa Sillon (\\"A new way of reading history\\"), Shin equated Korean history (kuksa) with that of the Korean nation (minjoksa), attempting to redirect people's loyalties to that category which he asserted always existed in history. For example, Shin asserted that Myocheong's rebellion (1135‚Äì1136) against Goryeo which was crushed by Kim Bu- sik as a \\"nationalist\\" rebellion. Myocheong had demanded that Goryeo move its capital north to s≈ègy≈èng (modern Pyongyang) and take a more aggressive stance against the Liao and Jin dynasties to the north, which Kim felt would undermine the security of the Goryeo state. Shin's later work, from the Chos≈èn sanggo munhwasa, showed more critical evaluation of primary sources, using methods from archaeology, epigraphy, and comparative linguistics, and relying less on Daejonggyo (Dangun-worship) scripture. = Ancientness and Inner Asian connection = Nationalist historiography considers the Yemaek the beginning of the \\"unity of race, culture, and statehood in the prehistoric Korean peninsula\\", overlooking the presence of the contemporary Upper Xiajiadian culture (1000‚Äì600 BCE) and Lower Xiajiadian culture (2200‚Äì1600 BCE) in Liaodong. Following the Japanese colonial paradigm of indigenism, Korean nationalist historiography asserts more and more ancient origins for Koreans in order to prove Korean cultural legitimacy. Such a search for \\"the racial origins\\" of Koreans mirrors the Japanese concept of kokutai (\\"national essence\\"), which was part of kokugaku scholarship. For Shin, the search for an ideal time in antiquity was not to when there was Confucian peace and stability‚Äîas in Chinese historiography's valorization of Emperors Yao and Shun‚Äîbut when the Korean minjok controlled the most territory. The retro- projection of 20th century concepts of race and ethnicity onto ancient Korea has resulted in a \\"complex jumble of contradictory narratives filled with Tan'gun fiction, competing dynastic myths, and hypothetical invasions of tribes, as well as unaccountable archaeological data... [that] has rendered it virtually impossible to distinguish fact from fiction in studies on ancient Korea.\\" Nationalism has so pervaded mainstream historical scholarship in South Korea that Chinese characters, used exclusively to write the Korean language until recently, are relegated to footnotes in academic journals or excluded completely. Historical periodization in North Korea is concerned with proving the \\"superiority and advancedness\\" of Korean civilization by \\"pushing the beginning of each historical stage as far back as possible\\". Korean nationalist historiography is connected with \\"popular archaeology\\" in South Korea, where television archaeologists competing for ratings make ever more- expansive claims to the limits of ancient Korea. For example, in 1993 the Korea Daily sponsored a trip of archaeologist Son Bo-gi of Yonsei University to Ulan Bator, Mongolia where Son claimed that he discovered a new Goguryeo stone fortress which proved that Goguryeo extended beyond the Greater Khingan range. Korean Bronze Age art has been connected by popular archaeologists, for example, to that of the Scythians, supposedly proving the \\"arrival of a superior northern race\\" into the Korean peninsula. Korean journalists and researchers also regularly travel along Silk Road sites in Central Asia searching for Korea's \\"Altaic roots\\". Choe Nam-seon, writing in the territorial tradition of Shin Chae-ho, argued that Korea was the center of the Purham culture which extended deep into Central Asia. According to Choe, the world was divided into Indo-European, Chinese, and \\"PƒÉrk\\" cultures (Purham munhwa kw≈èn), the last of whom was a Korean Shinto-like religion that spread from the Black Sea through the Caspian Sea, Tian Shan, the Altai Mountains, down through Korea, Japan, and Okinawa. Choe alleged that Dangun was universally worshiped within this super-culture. However, according to Chizuko Allen, Choe did not examine the local cultures of any countries besides Korea, China, and Japan, and based this theory on phonetic similarities of geographical features. Choe's Purham culture theory has since been adopted by the independence activist and \\"Korean Studies movement\\" leader An Chae-hong. = Revised Korean founding myth = Around the mid-Joseon Dynasty, the established view among historians traced Korean origins to Chinese refugees, considering Korean history that of a long series of kingdoms connected with China. As such, the Gija Joseon and Silla states were valorized, while the Gojoseon and Goguryeo states were not considered as important. According to this view, the first state in Korea, Gija Joseon, was founded by Jizi in 1122 BCE, who was a disgruntled Chinese advisor to the Shang Dynasty. The story of how he brought poetry, music, medicine, trade, and a political system to the Korean peninsula was conceived similarly to the proposed Founding of Rome by the Trojan refugee Aeneas. But by the 1930s, under the influence of Shin Chaeho's histories, the Jizi Korean founding story became less popular than that of Dangun, the son of a tiger and a bear ‚Äì the latter being common in Japanese folklore ‚Äì who brought civilization to the Korean peninsula. Shin and the other historians who promulgated this myth had been influenced by Daejonggyo, a new religious movement which worshipped Dangun, but attacked pre-annexation textbook narratives of Dangun which portrayed him as the brother of the Japanese god Susanoo. To Shin, Dangun was both the founder of the Korean minjok and the first Korean state (kuk), and thus the necessary starting point for Korean history. In response to a challenge by the Japanese scholars Shiratori Kurakichi and Imanishi Ry≈´ of Dangun as a fabrication by the author of the Samguk yusa, nationalist historian Choe Nam-seon attacked Japanese mythology as being built upon fabrications. By focusing on a mythological god which founded a \\"sacred race\\" (shins≈èng chongjok), Korean nationalist historiography seeks to portray ancient Korea as a golden age of \\"gods and heroes\\" where Korea's cultural achievements rivaled those of China and Japan. Accordingly, Shin Chaeho elevated Dangun to play a similar role as did the Yellow Emperor in China and which Amaterasu does in Japan. Choe Nam- seon, according to his Purham culture theory, places Dangun even above the Chinese and Japanese emperors, because those rulers were supposedly Shamanistic rulers of the ancient Korean \\"PƒÉrk\\" tradition. The Dangun story also lends credence to claims that Korean heritage is over 5000 years old. According to Hyung Il Pai, the popularity of Dangun studies can be said to \\"reflect the progressively ultra-nationalistic trend in Korean historical and archaeological scholarship today\\". Shin Chaeho named Mount Changbai (Baekdu in Korean) on the Sino-Korean border as a part of Korean heritage, by virtue of connection with the mythical Dangun. Changbai, however, was already claimed by the Manchus of China's Qing Dynasty since the 17th century for their origin myth, as well as by the Mongols, and the mountains are considered sacred in Han Chinese culture as well. This nationalist identification of Changbai/Baekdu with Koreans was cemented by the operation of Korean independence movement partisans operating from the Chinese border and retroactively legitimized with reference to the history of the Gojoseon and Balhae states. The Chinese civilizational connection to ancient Korea continues to be attacked by North Korean historians, who allege that the history of Gija Joseon was \\"viciously distorted by the feudal ruling class, the [sadaejuui] followers, and the big-power chauvinists\\". = Relationship with China and Japan =  Distinctiveness from  Korean ethnic nationalism is based on the idea that Koreans have existed as a single unique homogeneous race (tan'il minjok) since ancient times. As part of an effort to create a narrative of Korean origins free from \\"racial contamination\\" from Chinese or Japanese, racial histories of Koreans published in Korea usually begin with the line \\"Koreans are not Japanese\\". As a result, the most politically correct proposed origins of Koreans are from southern Siberia (pukpang-gye), from the \\"South Sea\\", or mythological (as in the Dangun story). The most influential articulation of these nationalist theories of origin is Kim Ch≈èng-hak's \\"History of the formation of the Korean race\\" (1964); others include Kim Ch≈èng-bae (1976, 1987, 1990), Yi Ki-baek (1977, [with Yi Ki-dong] 1983), Kim W≈èl-lyong (1970, 1986, 1989b), Yun Mu-by≈èng (1987), and Yi Chong-uk (1993). According to Shin Chaeho, the Korean people were the descendants of Dangun, who merged with the Buyeo (Fuyu) people of Manchuria and ended their development as the core of the Goguryeo people. In nationalist historiography, Korea is valorized as having an indigenous culture separate from those of China and Japan. Evidence of Chinese cultural influence on Koreans, as well as of common ancestral origins for Koreans and Japanese, is denounced as an \\"evil plot\\" of \\"Japanese imperialistic historiography\\" (Ilche sagwan) to \\"annihilate the Korean people\\" (minjok malsal). Shin Chaeho strove to make \\"Korea\\" a primary, bounded unit of East Asian history, which he believed had been distorted by Confucian historians who measured Koreans by a graduation between Chinese and barbarian. Archaeologists in both North and South Korea have claimed, contrary to earlier scholarship, that Korea experienced a Bronze Age culture separate from that of China, with artifacts resembling those in Siberia and Manchuria.  Superiority over  Korea is alternatively portrayed in nationalist historiography as being continually victimized throughout history by China and Japan, but remaining morally, racially, and culturally superior to them, since they‚Äîand more recently, Western powers‚Äîtried and \\"failed to suppress Korea's national spirit\\". Shin Chaeho's work shows the influence of Social Darwinism by portraying history as a racial struggle between the \\"Buyeo\\" (Korean) minjok with that of the Xianbei, Chinese, Mohe, and Jurchen over territory. He shamed historical figures who preserved or extended \\"Korean\\" control over Manchuria, and shamed those who did not, such as Muyeol of Silla. As a result, the search for heroes of the former led his Doksa Sillon to focus more on ancient, rather than recent history. Various self-designations for Koreans in the minjok struggle include \\"the good race\\" (s≈ènmin) and \\"the chosen or delivered people\\" (paedal). In postcolonial North and South Korean historiography, there is a tendency to emphasize the \\"superiority\\" (usus≈èng) and \\"advancedness\\" (s≈ènjins≈èng) of Korea's historical development. Nationalist historiography celebrates various victories of \\"Koreans\\" over \\"foreigners\\" including the Goguryeo‚ÄìSui War (612), Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War (645), Goryeo‚ÄìKhitan War (1018), Korean-Jurchen wars (1107), Mongol invasions of Korea (1231‚Äì73), and Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì1598). Accordingly, military heroes such as Eulji Mundeok of Goguryeo‚Äîand indeed all the generals of the Three contemporary kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla‚Äîare assigned a common, \\"national\\" identity of Korean. In the words of John Duncan, however, it is \\"extremely unlikely\\" that the people of those kingdoms would identify with \\"a larger, 'Korean' collectivity that transcended local boundaries and state loyalties\\". Yi Sang- ryong, who argued that history \\"raised the dignity of the country and fostered patriotism\\" (kungmin ch≈èngshin) claimed that during the \\"northern history\\" of Koreans in Manchuria, from the time of Dangun to Balhae, the Sushen (Suksin) and Japanese people were subordinate to Dangun. Shin Chaeho has also argued for the existence of monotheism in ancient Korea, elevating Koreans to the \\"advanced\\" civilizations of the Middle East; however, this theory contradicts other nationalist historiography which propose Shamanism as an ancient Korean religion, as well as that of nearly all religious historians, who say Koreans were syncretist. Na Se-jin, Korea's most quoted physical anthropologist, asserted in 1964 that Koreans are superior in \\"looks, brains, bravery, stature, and strength\\" to the Chinese and Japanese, and resemble Europeans more than \\"Mongoloids\\", reflecting nationalist historiography's fixation on prehistorical racial roots. For Shin, the founding of Korea by such an antique figure as Dangun proved that Korea was more ancient that China; that Dangun colonized China proving that Korea was superior to China; and that mythical Chinese emperors and sages were really \\"Korean\\". Shin also reconceived the \\"Great Plan\\" (Hungfan chin ch'ou Ê¥™ÁØÑ‰πùÁñá) given by Jizi of Gija Joseon as being made by \\"a man of [Joseon]\\", turning China into an importer of Korean civilization, opposite to the traditional view.  Historical territory  = Owning and transcending the peninsula = In his seminal work Doksa Sillon, Shin Chaeho redefined the subject of Korean national history from only the Korean Peninsula both towards the outer limits of \\"Manchuria\\" and to that of the \\"racially defined nation\\" (minjok). By defining Korean history as that of the minjok, he could argue that Goguryeo, Silla, and Baekje, despite frequent wars between each other, were \\"of the same minjok and consequently of the same history\\". However, the conception of a Korean nation as being bounded by the Yalu and Tumen rivers was reinforced by Confucian histories of Joseon that did not confer legitimacy on dynasties that held such extreme northern territory. Shin Chaeho particularly resented this confinement, considering the fall of Goguryeo and the loss of \\"Korean\\" control over its extrapeninsular territory as the beginning of the minjok's decline. He wrote: \\"When the Korean minjok obtains Manchuria, the Korean minjok is strong and prosperous. When another [Eastern or Northern] minjok obtains Manchuria... then Korea [Han'guk] enters that... [Eastern or Northern] minjok's sphere of power.... This is an iron rule that has not changed for four thousand years\\", a sentiment with which a large number of contemporary Koreans agree. In this lament, Shin found common cause with Imperial Japanese historians of the Mansenshi school, who wished to portray the Korean peninsula and the Asian continent as inseparable, but with the obverse goal of undermining ideas of Korean independence. Not only did Shin, but also the fellow nationalist historian Park Eun-sik consider Manchuria the foundation on which to build a powerful \\"Greater Korea\\". At the same time, however, nationalist historiography presupposes that any polity inhabiting the Korean peninsula was \\"Korean\\"; and that all of the inhabitants of the peninsula were unchangingly and homogeneously \\"Korean\\" for \\"5000 years\\". E. Taylor Atkins criticizes these assumptions as \\"no less questionable than those that Japanese colonial scholars brought\\", and as contributing to modern territorial disputes with China and Japan. Historical study of Jeju Island, Ulleungdo, and the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo or Takeshima), commensurate with their conception as Korean since the late Joseon, served the timely needs of maritime defense. = Reinterpretation of Balhae as Korean = During the mid-Joseon dynasty, Park Ji-won denied the fact that the Han Dynasty's territories extended south of the Yalu, and criticized Kim Bu-sik for excluding Balhae (Bohai in Chinese) in Manchuria from the history of Korea, arguing that Balhae were \\"descendants\\" of Goguryeo. Yi Kyu-gy≈èng argued that the exclusion of Balhae from Korean history was \\"a grave error\\" since \\"it occupied a vast area\\". In the Joseon's later years, however, increasing numbers of Korean historians included Balhae into Korean history, despite acknowledging that the state's founders were the Mohe people, who could not be considered Korean. In the 18th century, the divide was such that the scholars Seongho Yi Ik and An Ch≈èngbok adamantly refused to consider Balhae part of Korean history, while Sin Ky≈èngjun and Yu Deuk-gong fully incorporated it. One century later, Han Ch'iyun () and Han Chins≈è () would include Balhae as equal in Korean history to such uncontroversially Korean dynasties like Silla. Shin Chaeho criticized the Samguk Sagi for excluding Balhae and the Buyeo kingdom (Chinese: Fuyu, another Manchurian state) from Korean history. He interpreted Balhae's defeat by the Khitan-led Liao dynasty as having caused \\"half of our ancestor [Dangun]'s ancient lands... [loss] for over nine hundred years\\". North Korean scholars‚Äîand more recently some in the South‚Äîhave recently tried to incorporate Balhae history as an integral part of Korean history by challenging the view of Unified Silla as the unification of Korea. According to this narrative, Goryeo was the first unification of Korea, since Balhae still existed while occupying former Goguryeo territory north of the Korean peninsula. = Denial of ancient Han Dynasty presence = The demonization of Japanese historical and archaeological findings in Korea as imperialist forgeries owes in part to those scholars' discovery of the Lelang Commandery‚Äîby which the Han Dynasty administered territory near Pyongyang‚Äîand insistence that this Chinese commandery had a major influence on the development of Korean civilization. Until the North Korean challenge, it was universally accepted that Lelang was a commandery established by Emperor Wu of Han after he defeated Gojoseon in 108 BCE. To deal with the Han Dynasty tombs, North Korean scholars have reinterpreted them as the remains of Gojoseon or Goguryeo. For those artifacts that bear undeniable similarities to those found in Han China, they propose that they were introduced through trade and international contact, or were forgeries, and \\"should not by any means be construed as a basis to deny the Korean characteristics of the artifacts\\". The North Koreans also say that there were two Lelangs, and that the Han actually administered a Lelang on the Liao River on the Liaodong peninsula, while Pyongyang was an \\"independent Korean state\\" of Lelang, which existed between the 2nd century BCE until the 3rd century CE. The traditional view of Lelang, according to them, was expanded by Chinese chauvinists and Japanese imperialists. = Claims on Liaodong and other Chinese territories = Shin Chae-ho drew on irredentist themes from Imperial Japanese historiography, which argued for territorial expansion based on past control. To justify a Greater Japan, the Japanese historian Kume Kunitake criticized the notion of Japan as an island state, proposing that Japan had governed Korea and southeastern China in the past. Shin's historiography justified a Greater Korea with reference to territories Korea had supposedly held in the past, which Shin took to mean‚Äîfrom Baekje: western Liaodong, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yue Prefecture, and the surrounding areas; and from Silla: northeastern Jilin. He felt that Unified Silla, Goryeo, and Joseon were not true \\"unifications\\" of the Korean people as had been previously thought, but only \\"semi-\\" or \\"half-\\" unifications (panp'yonjok t'ongil), with a full unification yet unfulfilled since the times of Dangun. Earlier, Park Ji-won argued that Liaodong and other territories above the Yalu River should be considered historical Korean territory, or else Korea would lose more territory. Yi Kyu-gy≈èng believed that the Liaodong Peninsula was \\"irrefutably\\" ancient Korean territory because the Korean name for Liaodong was Samhan (), or \\"Three Korean States\\". Nationalist scholars asserted Korean ownership of Liaodong and the surrounding area based on the Chinese dynastic History of Liao and History of Jin. However, mainstream acceptance of claims to Manchurian territory in Korea occurred only when the Empire of Japan expanded into north and northeast China. Colonial Japanese scholars such as Iwakichi Inaba, Shiratori Kurakichi, Torii Ry≈´z≈ç, Imanishi Ry≈´, and Ikeuchi Hiroshi declared that there was one unified \\"Manchurian-Korean history\\" (Mansen-shi). The South Korean Yun Nae-hy≈èn proposed in 1985 that Gojoseon lasted for two thousand years from before 2333 BCE, stretching from Hebei in north China to all of Korea. Important dissenters to the Liaodong-as-Korean view during Joseon included Jeong Yak-yong, who argued that Liaodong was \\"superfluous\\" to Korea's natural river borders; and Seongho Yi Ik, who regarded irredentism against China as a \\"greedy ambition\\" that could lead to trouble in the future; against the nationalist historians of 1910 who bemoaned the \\"loss\\" of Manchuria and decline of the Korean minjok, An Hwak represented a dissenting voice. The Daejonggyo cult of Dangun wrote \\"historical tales\\" (sahwa) which influenced Korean nationalist historiography of the 20th century. The pan- Dongyi pan-Northeast Asian arguments of the sahwa included the assertion that the Korean nation included \\"not only the Korean peninsula and Manchuria, but also northeastern China\\", considering the Emperors of Shun, Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing as part of Korean history. This expanded concept of the Korean nation was included in Kim Kyo-h≈èn's Korean history textbooks intended to boost the morale of military cadets studying in exile in China. According to Kim, since all these peoples who led the dynasties originated in Manchuria‚Äîunlike, say, Jizi of Gija Joseon‚Äî, they are all descendants of Dangun, and thus part of the Korean minjok's \\"northern\\" branch of history. As a result, he considered all the lands conquered by those peoples, including most lately \\"the land of the Han, Mongolia, the territory of the Hui, and Tibet\\" all the way down to Burma as included in the territory of the Korean minjok. Yi Sang-ryong made a number of arguments in common with Shin, Kim Kyoh≈èn and Park Eun-sik: that the Manchu people were actually Korean; that the Four Commanderies of Han were located in Liaodong and not \\"Korean\\" territory; and that some portion of Korean history should be centered in Manchuria, with the goal of creating a greater Joseon state which included the territory. Shin argued that the \\"trends in geographical history\\" portended future Korean control over former Goguryeo territories, and advocated Korean emigration to \\"relight\\" (chunggwang) the lost history of Dangun. As a result of peasant uprisings, famines, and Imperial Japanese encouragement, Korean immigration to Manchuria soared from 1860, reaching 400,000 Koreans by 1920; 900,000 by 1931, and over two million by 1945. Korean nationalist historiography which holds the subjugation of Manchuria by Korean dynasties as glorious has clashed with contemporary Chinese nationalism, which regard the territory as a Chinese borderland (bianjiang). Chinese historians even object to the name \\"Manchuria\\", which evokes a historical independence used to justify imperial powers' attempted separation of that territory from China. Accordingly, they believe that the proper name is \\"China's Northeast\\" (dongbei). The Goguryeo controversies around 2002 reflected nationalist sentiment in both China and Korea, stimulated by state-affiliated scholars and institutes from both sides which argued about whether Goguryeo should be considered part of Chinese or Korean history.
